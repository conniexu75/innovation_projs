Using peptide phage display, we identified a series of peptides having the core sequence DICLPRWGCLW that specifically bind serum albumin from multiple species with high affinity. These peptides bind to albumin with 1:1 stoichiometry at a site distinct from known small molecule binding sites. Using surface plasmon resonance, the dissociation equilibrium constant of peptide SA21 (Ac-RLIEDICLPRWGCLWEDD-NH2) was determined to be 266 ± 8, 320 ± 22, and 467 ± 47 nm for rat, rabbit, and human albumin, respectively. SA21 has an unusually long half-life of 2.3 h when injected by intravenous bolus into rabbits. A related sequence, fused to the anti-tissue factor Fab of D3H44 (Presta, L., Sims, P., Meng, Y. G., Moran, P., Bullens, S., Bunting, S., Schoenfeld, J., Lowe, D., Lai, J., Rancatore, P., Iverson, M., Lim, A., Chisholm, V., Kelley, R. F., Riederer, M., and Kirchhofer, D. (2001) Thromb. Haemost. 85, 379–389), enabled the Fab to bind albumin with similar affinity to that of SA21 while retaining the ability of the Fab to bind tissue factor. This interaction with albumin resulted in reduced in vivoclearance of 25- and 58-fold in mice and rabbits, respectively, when compared with the wild-type D3H44 Fab. The half-life was extended 37-fold to 32.4 h in rabbits and 26-fold to 10.4 h in mice, achieving 25–43% of the albumin half-life in these animals. These half-lives exceed those of a Fab′2 and are comparable with those seen for polyethylene glycol-conjugated Fab molecules, immunoadhesins, and albumin fusions, suggesting a novel and generic method for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of rapidly cleared proteins.

The effectiveness of recombinant protein pharmaceuticals depends heavily on the intrinsic pharmacokinetics of the natural protein. Because the kidney generally filters out molecules below 60 kDa, efforts to reduce clearance have focused on increasing molecular size through protein fusions, glycosylation, or the addition of polyethylene glycol polymers (i.e.PEG). 1The abbreviations used are: PEG, polyethylene glycol; Fv, the variable light and variable heavy domains of an IgG; scFv, a single-chain Fv; Fab, the antigen binding fragment consisting of the light chain and the variable and first constant domains of the heavy chain; Fab′2, two Fab fragments joined by disulfides at the hinge region; TF, the extracellular domain of human tissue factor (residues 1–219); D3H44, a humanized IgG directed against human TF; D3H44 Fab, the Fab portion of D3H44; D3H44-L, D3H44 Fab with SA06 fused to the carboxyl terminus of the light chain; D3H44-Ls, D3H44 Fab lacking the light-heavy chain disulfide with SA06 fused to the carboxyl terminal of the light chain; FX, coagulation Factor X; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; TCEP, tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 1The abbreviations used are: PEG, polyethylene glycol; Fv, the variable light and variable heavy domains of an IgG; scFv, a single-chain Fv; Fab, the antigen binding fragment consisting of the light chain and the variable and first constant domains of the heavy chain; Fab′2, two Fab fragments joined by disulfides at the hinge region; TF, the extracellular domain of human tissue factor (residues 1–219); D3H44, a humanized IgG directed against human TF; D3H44 Fab, the Fab portion of D3H44; D3H44-L, D3H44 Fab with SA06 fused to the carboxyl terminus of the light chain; D3H44-Ls, D3H44 Fab lacking the light-heavy chain disulfide with SA06 fused to the carboxyl terminal of the light chain; FX, coagulation Factor X; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; TCEP, tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For example, fusions to large long lived proteins such as albumin (1Syed S. Schuyler P. Kulczycky M. Sheffield W.P. Blood. 1997; 89: 3243-3252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Yeh P. Landais D.

Small molecule drugs have long relied on their association with various plasma components to improve their pharmacokinetic properties in vivo; however, a drug associated with plasma protein is usually unavailable for binding to the target although its half-life is extended. Since only the unbound fraction of the small molecule is generally functionally active, a fine balance must be maintained between the concentration of free drug required for efficacy and the frequency at which it must be administered (8). Albumin (molecular mass ∼67 kDa) is the most abundant protein in plasma, present at 50 mg/ml (600 μm), and has a half-life of 19 days in humans (9Peters Jr., T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1985; 37: 161-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 10Peters Jr., T. All about Albumin. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar). Albumin serves to maintain plasma pH, contributes to colloidal blood pressure, functions as carrier of many metabolites and fatty acids, and serves as a major drug transport protein in plasma. There are several major small molecule binding sites in albumin that have been described. Warfarin is known to bind at site I, benzodiazepines and indoles at site II, and cardenolides and biliary acids at site III. In addition, there is an important metal ion binding site. Noncovalent association with albumin has been shown to extend the half-life of short lived proteins. A recombinant fusion of the albumin binding domain from streptococcal protein G to human complement receptor type 1 increased its half-life 3-fold to 5 h in rats (11Makrides S.C. Nygren P.-A. Andrews B. Ford P.J. Evans K.S. Hayman E.G. Adari H. Levin J. Uhlen M. Toth C.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 534-542PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, fusion to this domain has served to enhance the immunological response directed to peptide antigens (12Sjolander A. Nygren P.-A. Stahl S. Berzins K. Uhlen M. Perlmann P. Andersson R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 201: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In another example, when insulin was acylated with fatty acids to promote association with albumin (13Kurtzhals P.

Halstrom J. Hasselager E. Larsen U.D. Ribel U. Schaffer L. Vad K. Jonassen I. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), a protracted effect was observed when injected subcutaneously in rabbits or pigs. Together, these studies demonstrate a linkage between albumin binding and prolonged action. In this report, peptide phage display was used to develop peptides that selectively bind albumin with high affinity. These peptides bind to albumin from multiple species at a novel site distinct from the known classical binding sites. To test whether association of a short lived protein with albumin could improve its pharmacokinetic properties, one albumin binding peptide was added to a Fab through the use of a simple recombinant fusion that rendered it capable of binding albumin without affecting antigen binding. We demonstrate this approach as a viable route to increasing the half-life of potentially important protein pharmaceuticals. Eighteen phage libraries expressing random peptide sequences fused to the major coat protein, P8 (15Lowman H.B. Chen Y.M. Skelton N.J. Mortensen D.L. Tomlinson E.E. Sadick M.D. Robinson I.C.A.F. Clark R.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8870-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), were pooled into four groups: pool A contained CX 2GPX 4C,X 4CX 2GPX 4CX 4, and X iCX jCX k, where j = 8–10; pool B containedX 20 andX iCX jCX k, where j = 4–7; pool C containedX 8 andX 2CX jCX 2, where j = 4–6; pool D containedX 2CX jCX 2where j = 7–10. X represents any of the 20 naturally occurring l-amino acids, and in pools A and B,i + j + k = 18 and ‖i − k‖ < 2. Each library has in excess of 1010 clones. The phage library pools were suspended in binding buffer (PBS, 1% ovalbumin, 0.05% Tween 20) and sorted against rabbit, rat, or human albumin (Sigma) immobilized directly on Maxisorp plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at 10 μg/ml in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Plates were blocked for 1 h at 25 °C using PBS, containing 1% ovalbumin except for round 4, where Tris-buffered saline-casein blocker (Pierce) was used. Phage were allowed to bind for 2 h. Unbound phage were removed by repetitive washing with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and bound phage were eluted with 500 mm KCl, 10 mmHCl, pH 2. Eluted phage were propagated in XL1-Blue cells with VCSM13 helper phage (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Enrichment was monitored by titering the number of phage that bound to an albumin coated well compared with a well coated with ovalbumin or casein. Phage clones (∼1011phage) were added to Maxisorp plates coated with mouse, rat, rabbit, bovine, rhesus, or human albumin (Sigma) as described above. The microtiter plate was washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and bound phage were detected following incubation with HRP/anti-M13 conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. The amount of HRP bound was measured using ABTS/H2O2 substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and monitoring the absorbance at 405 nm. A soft randomized library was designed using an oligonucleotide coding for clone RB but synthesized with a 70:10:10:10 mixture of bases as described (16Dennis M.S. Eigenbrot C. Skelton N.J. Ultsch M.H. Santell L. Dwyer M.A. O'Connell M.P. Lazarus R.A. Nature. 2000; 404: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A fully randomized library was designed holding highly selected residues (underlined) constant:X 5D X CLP X WGCLW X 4; randomized positions (X) were coded by NNS. Both the soft randomized and fully randomized libraries were sorted against rat, rabbit, and human serum albumin as above. Peptides were synthesized by either manual or automated (Milligen 9050) Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-based solid phase synthesis on a 0.25-mmol scale using a PEG-polystyrene resin as described (17Dennis M.S. Roberge M. Quan C. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9513-9521Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The carboxyl terminal lysine of peptide SA08 was derivatized withN-hydroxysuccinimide-LC-biotin as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce) and purified by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography, yielding SA08b (Ac-QGLIGDICLPRWGCLWGDSVKb-NH2, where Kb refers to lysine-biotin). Rat, rabbit, or mouse albumin was immobilized directly on Maxisorp plates and blocked as above. Samples, serially diluted in binding buffer were added to the plate, followed immediately by the addition of 10 nm SA08b for 1 h at 25 °C. SA08b has an EC50 of 2 and 4 nm for rat and rabbit albumin, respectively. The microtiter plate was washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and bound SA08b was detected with streptavidin/HRP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The amount of HRP bound was measured using ABTS/H2O2 substrate as above. The binding affinities between SA peptides and albumin were obtained using a BIAcore 3000 (BIAcore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Human, rabbit, and rat albumin were captured on a CM5 chip using amine coupling at ∼5000 resonance units. SA peptides at 0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 μm were injected at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 30 s. The bound peptides were allowed to dissociate for 5 min before matrix regeneration using 10 mm glycine, pH 3. The signal from an injection passing over an uncoupled cell was subtracted from that of an immobilized cell to generate sensorgrams of the amount of peptide bound as a function of time. The running buffer, PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, was used for all sample dilutions. BIAcore kinetic evaluation software (version 3.1) was used to determineK D from the association and dissociation rates using a one-to-one binding model. Three male New Zealand White rabbits were administered an intravenous bolus dose of 2 mg/kg of SA21 in PBS. Eighteen blood samples were collected at serial time points just prior to dosing and from 1 min to 21 days postdosing. Samples were collected in tubes containing sodium citrate as an anticoagulant and then centrifuged, and the plasma portion was frozen at −70 °C until analysis using an electrospray ionization, LC/MS/MS method. The mass spectrometer used was an API 4000 (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Foster City, CA). The autosampler was a CTCPAL System (Leap Technologies, Chapel Hill, NC) equipped with a cooling stack. The high pressure liquid chromatography system consisted of the Shimadzu SCI-10A system controller with two Shimadzu LC-10A pumps. A prefilter was placed in front of the analytical column (C18, 2.1 × 50 mm; Phenomenex Synergi 4μ MAX-RP 80A). The column flow was set at 500 μl/min. Solvent systems A (100% H2O) and B (100% acetonitrile) both contained 1% formic acid. A fast gradient (0.0–0.4 min, 90% A; 0.4–0.8 min, from 90% A to 10% A; 0.8–1.8 min, 10% A; 1.8–2.0 min, from 10% A to 90% A; 2.0–3.0 min, 90% A) was used for all analysis. The injection volume was 10 μl. SA 21 was initially characterized via direct infusion (1 μm in 20% acetonitrile) into the API 4000. The transition of triply charged ion 758 to fragment 948 was optimized for analysis in plasma matrix. Standard curves were prepared in citrated rabbit plasma in 96-well plates by adding 10 μl of diluted SA21 into 190 μl of plasma over a range of 2500 to 4.9 nm. Tri(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a reducing agent to enhance peptide recovery and was added to all samples at a final concentration of 2 mm for 20 min at 37 °C. Plasma proteins were then precipitated by the addition of 160 μl of 80% acetonitrile to 40 μl of plasma for 10 min and removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10 °C. The supernatant was transferred to another 96-well plate, and the plate was sealed with silicone sealing mat (AxyGen, Inc., Union City, CA). Samples were placed in the autosampler at 5 °C to be analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Samples with a high concentration of SA21 (PK samples from 1 min to 7 h) were diluted 10-fold with blank rabbit plasma prior to TCEP addition. Pharmacokinetic parameters were fitted to a one-compartment elimination model using WinNonlin software, version 3.1 (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA) to obtain the clearance (CL), volume of distribution (V 1), elimination half-life ( t12), and drug exposure (AUC). D3H44 Fab was produced as described (18Presta L. Sims P. Meng Y.G. Moran P. Bullens S. Bunting S. Schoenfeld J. Lowe D. Lai J. Rancatore P. Iverson M. Lim A. Chisholm V. Kelley R.F. Riederer M. Kirchhofer D. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). D3H44-L was constructed by inserting DNA encoding a linker sequence (GGGS) followed by SA06 (QRLMEDICLPRWGCLWEDDF) onto the carboxyl-terminal end of the light chain of D3H44 using Kunkel mutagenesis (19Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). D3H44-Ls was constructed in the same manner; however, additional mutations were added to remove the disulfide between the light and heavy chains of the Fab. Each chain was terminated one residue prior to the heavy-light interchain disulfide followed by the addition of the linker sequence and peptide SA06 to the light chain. The resulting plasmids, pD3H44-L and pD3H44-Ls, were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression of D3H44-L and D3H44-Ls was carried out as described (18Presta L. Sims P. Meng Y.G. Moran P. Bullens S. Bunting S. Schoenfeld J. Lowe D. Lai J. Rancatore P. Iverson M. Lim A. Chisholm V. Kelley R.F. Riederer M. Kirchhofer D. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested; frozen; suspended in 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and disrupted using a tissue homogenizer. D3H44-L and D3H44-Ls were rapidly purified using a Hi-Trap tissue factor (TF) affinity column followed by a Hi-Trap rabbit albumin affinity column (Amersham Biosciences), each generated as recommended by the manufacturer. Both columns were washed with PBS and eluted with 50 mm HCl. Eluted fractions were immediately neutralized using 1 m Tris, pH 8. D3H44-L and D3H44-Ls were further purified using Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS followed by an extraction with Triton X-114 to remove traces of endotoxin (20Aida Y. Pabst M.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 132: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). D3H44-L and D3H44-Ls were judged greater than 99% pure by SDS-PAGE. The FX activation assay and the prothrombin time assay were performed as described previously (18Presta L. Sims P. Meng Y.G. Moran P. Bullens S. Bunting S. Schoenfeld J. Lowe D. Lai J. Rancatore P. Iverson M. Lim A. Chisholm V. Kelley R.F. Riederer M. Kirchhofer D. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A soluble mutant of TF (E219C) (21Kelley R.F. Methods. 1994; 6: 111-120Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was specifically biotinylated using a 4-fold molar excess of biotin BMCC (Pierce) in 200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% Me2SO. The reaction was desalted using an NAP5 (AmershamBiosciences) column and concentrated via Centricon YM10 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to 260 μm. Biotinylated TF binds to D3H44 Fab immobilized directly on a Maxisorp plate (10 μg/ml in PBS, overnight at 4 °C and blocked for 1 h at 25 °C using casein blocker (Pierce)) with an EC50 of 11 nm. For the albumin/TF sandwich assay, rabbit albumin was immobilized as described above. Dilutions of D3H44 Fab, D3H44-L, or D3H44-Ls were added in binding buffer for 1 h. The plate was washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and 50 nm biotinylated TF in binding buffer was added for 1 h. The microtiter plate was washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and streptavidin/HRP was added. After a final wash, bound HRP was measured as above. Groups of three New Zealand White rabbits were given an intravenous bolus of 400–525 μg/kg D3H44 variants (D3H44 Fab, D3H44-L, D3H44-Ls) into the marginal ear vein. Plasma samples were obtained from an arterial catheter placed in the contralateral ear over a 21-day period for analysis by TF ELISA (see below). Individual plasma concentration versus time curves were fitted to a two-compartment elimination model using WinNonlin version 3.0 (Pharsight, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The pharmacokinetic parameters of clearance, V 1, steady state volume (V ss), t12, AUC, and AUC corrected for actual dose administered (AUC/dose) were averaged for each treatment group. Differences between groups were determined by analysis of variance, with significance at p < 0.05. Groups of nine BALB/c mice received a 5.0 mg/kg intravenous bolus of D3H44 Fab or D3H44-L into the tail vein. Plasma samples were obtained by eye bleed from three mice per time point over 2–9 days and assayed for concentration of D3H44 using the TF ELISA. The average plasma concentration was obtained for each time point and fitted to a two-compartment elimination model using WinNonlin version 3.0. As the analysis of the mouse experiment produces one average concentrationversus time profile for each variant, PK parameters are presented as a single estimate for the group of nine mice. The concentration of D3H44 Fab, D3H44-L, and D3H44-Ls in rabbit plasma was determined using a TF ELISA. Maxisorp plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml TF (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA) in 50 mmsodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Plates were blocked with 0.5% ovalbumin in PBS, pH 7.4. Diluted antibody standards (0.23–50 ng/ml) and samples (minimum dilution 1:100) in PBS containing 0.5% ovalbumin, 0.05% polysorbate 20, 0.35 n NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% CHAPS, 0.2% bovine γ-globulins (Sigma), and 1% plasma were added to the plates for 2 h. Antibody bound to the plates was detected with HRP-conjugated goat anti-human Fab′2 antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Bound HRP was measured using the substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine/H2O2 (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), and the change in absorbance was monitored at 450 nm. Data falling in the linear range of the standard curve was used to calculate D3H44 concentrations in the samples. D3H44 Fab and D3H44-L in mouse plasma were assayed in the same enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay except that samples were diluted in buffer without 1% plasma and the standard curve range was 0.31–40 ng/ml. Naive peptide phage library pools A through D were selected against rat, rabbit, and human albumin. Each pool, with the exception of pool D when human albumin was the target, showed enrichment for each species of albumin. The sequences from the enriched pools revealed in each case that a single clone had taken over the pool. The inferred peptide sequences from these clones are shown in Table I.Table ISequences of phage clones selected from polyvalent naive libraries for binding rat, rabbit, or human albuminThe locations of fixed cysteines from the library design are shaded.

A qualitative assessment of the ability of phage bearing the indicated peptide sequence to bind human (HSA), rabbit (BuSA), or rat (RSA) albumin is indicated. Interestingly, albumin has greater than 70% amino acid sequence identity between these species, yet unique peptide sequences originating from within a given phage library pool were identified for each species. The sequence similarity observed between clones HB and HC, RA and RD, and RB and RC, despite their origins from independent phage library pools, suggests the importance of the homologous residues in binding to the respective species of albumin. Individual phage clones were examined using a phage binding assay, a quick qualitative screen to assess species selectivity. Whereas phage clones generally bound only to the albumin for which they were selected, clones HB and HC, selected for binding to human albumin, also bound to rat albumin, and clone RB, selected for binding to rat albumin, bound albumin from all three species (Table I). None of the phage clones bound to structurally unrelated ovalbumin, indicating that the interaction with albumin was specific. Because of its broad recognition of rat, rabbit, and human albumin, clone RB was chosen for sequence maturation on phage using “soft randomization.” The potential diversity of a soft randomized library is the same as the starting naive libraries; however, a soft randomized library maintains a bias toward a particular sequence, in this case DNA coding for the peptide sequence from clone RB. Sequences after four rounds of selection against rat, rabbit, or human albumin are shown in Table II along with results from the phage binding assay. All clones were specific for the albumin to which they were selected based upon their lack of binding to immobilized ovalbumin and casein; however, several clones also bound to albumin from other species including bovine, rhesus, and mouse albumin (TableII).Table IISequences of phage clones selected for binding rat, rabbit, or human albumin following soft randomization of clone RBAmino acids positions identical in clone RB, the starting sequence used for soft randomization are shaded.

A qualitive assessment of the ability of phage bearing the indicated peptide sequence to bind human (HSA), rabbit (BuSA), rat (RSA), bovine (BSA), rhesus (RhSA), and mouse (MSA) albumin is indicated (nd indicates not determined). Since at any given position, the amino acid present in the parent sequence was designed to appear approximately half the time in these libraries, only fully conserved positions are likely to indicate important structural or contact elements that support albumin binding. A final library that kept these highly selected residues (underlined) constant,X 5D X CLP X WGCLW X 4, while allowing all 20 amino acids at the 11 remaining positions allowed a more extensive search of pertinent sequence space. The sequence preferences at each randomized position resulting from selection against rabbit albumin are shown in Fig.1. A similar profile was observed from sequences selected for binding rat and human albumin (not shown). For each species of albumin, there was a strong preference for Ile at position 7 and Arg at position 11, thus generating a core consensus of DICLPRWGCLW. Additionally, there was a general preference for negatively charged residues (Asp or Glu) at positions flanking this core, particularly on the carboxyl terminus. Several peptides patterned after the sequences selected for albumin binding were synthesized. Their binding to human, rabbit, and rat albumin was assessed by Biacore, and a peptide competition assay was used to assess their affinity for rabbit and mouse albumin (Tables III andIV). The IC50 values obtained for binding to rabbit albumin compared favorably withK d values determined by Biacore (Table III). In comparison with rabbit and rat albumin, the peptides bind more weakly to human and more tightly to mouse albumin; however, the rank affinity of a given peptide is generally maintained from species to species. Peptide SA15, representing the consensus for binding rabbit albumin (Fig. 1), had the lowest IC50 value in the peptide binding assay and highest affinity by surface plasmon resonance for rabbit albumin (Table III). A linear peptide, identical to SA06 but with both Cys residues changed to Ala, had an IC50 greater than 50 μm, demonstrating the importance of the disulfide. In addition, the affinity of the peptides for rabbit albumin diminished with reduction in the length of the peptides (T"

To investigate the potential role of MK in tumor growth, we expressed MK in human SW-13 cells and studied receptor binding, signal transduction, and activity of MK. The MK protein stimulates soft agar colony formationin vitro and tumor growth of SW-13 cells in athymic nude mice, as well as proliferation of human endothelial cells from brain microvasculature and umbilical vein (HUVEC) in the low ng/ml range. MK binds to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), the receptor for PTN, with an apparent K d of 170 pm in intact cells, and this receptor binding of MK is competed by PTN with an apparent K d of ∼20 pm. Monoclonal antibodies raised against the extracellular ligand-binding domain of ALK inhibit ALK receptor binding of MK as well as MK-stimulated colony formation of SW-13 cells. Furthermore, MK stimulates ALK phosphorylation in WI-38 human fibroblasts and activates PI3-kinase and MAP kinase signal transduction in WI-38, HUVEC, neuroblastoma (SH SY-5Y) and glioblastoma (U87MG) cells that express the ALK protein. We conclude that MK can act as a growth, survival, and angiogenic factor during tumorigenesis and signals through the ALK receptor.

MK is a member of the pleiotrophin (PTN)/MK family and was originally described as a retinoic acid-inducible, developmentally regulated, heparin-binding, neurotrophic factor (2Kadomatsu K. Huang R.P.

Physiologically, MK is highly expressed during midgestation in the brain and numerous other organs and is down-regulated at birth. In the adult, MK shows a very restricted pattern of expression with the highest transcript levels in the intestine and low levels in the cerebellum, thyroid, kidney, bladder, lung alveoli, colon, stomach, and spleen (reviewed in Refs. 10Tsutsui J.

Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2515-2518PubMed Google Scholar). MK modulates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during fetal development and organogenesis in the mouse (12Mitsiadis T.A. Salmivirta M. Muramatsu T. Muramatsu H. Rauvala H. Lehtonen E. Jalkanen M. Thesleff I. Development. 1995; 121: 37-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in Xenopus (13Sekiguchi K. Yokota C. Asashima M. Kaname T. Fan Q.W. Muramatsu T. Kadomatsu K. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). From in vitro cell biology studies and the embryonic expression pattern of MK in the central nervous system it was concluded that MK directs neurite interconnections during an early phase of brain development and may later on have a maintenance function in some restricted areas. In primary neuronal cultures isolated from mouse cerebral cortex MK inhibits the induction of apoptosis (14Owada K. Sanjo N. Kobayashi T. Mizusawa H. Muramatsu H. Muramatsu T. Michikawa M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2084-2092PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, MK promotes migration of various cells such as embryonic neurons (15Maeda N. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kimura T. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12474-12479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), neutrophils (16Takada T. Kinkori T. Muramatsu H. Hayakawa A. Torii S. Muramatsu T.

These biological activities suggest that MK may have a role in survival and invasion of tumor cells. Interestingly, during pathologic alterations in the adult brain such as Alzheimer's disease (18Yasuhara O. Muramatsu H. Kim S.U. Muramatsu T. Maruta H. McGeer P.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or during cerebral infarction (19Wang S. Yoshida Y. Goto M. Moritoyo T. Tsutsui J. Izumo S. Sato E. Muramatsu T. Osame M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 106: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the expression of midkine re-emerges, and it has been suggested that this may reflect the activation of a repair mechanism (19Wang S. Yoshida Y. Goto M. Moritoyo T. Tsutsui J. Izumo S. Sato E. Muramatsu T. Osame M. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 106: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that MK might also serve as an angiogenic factor. In the endometrial epithelium, MK is up-regulated by estradiol; this up-regulation correlates with enhanced angiogenic activity in this tissue (20Zhang L. Rees M.C. Bicknell R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 323-331PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, MK is known to enhance plasminogen activator and plasmin activity in bovine aortic endothelial cells (21Kojima S. Muramatsu H. Amanuma H. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9590-9596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 22Kojima S. Seikagaku. 1997; 69: 104-108PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that MK may also have a role in tissue repair and angiogenesis. The MK-related growth factor PTN is overexpressed in a number of tumors; we and others have show that PTN can function as a tumor growth factor (23Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T.

We used ribozyme-targeting of PTN mRNA to demonstrate that PTN can be the rate-limiting growth factor for melanoma growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in vivo (27Czubayko F. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A.

It is worth emphasizing that midkine expression is very restricted in adult normal tissues, which makes all these findings more significant. To date, high levels of midkine expression have been correlated with a poor prognosis in neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and bladder carcinoma (11O'Brien T. Cranston D. Fuggle S. Bicknell R. Harris A.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2515-2518PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nakagawara A. Milbrandt J. Muramatsu T. Deuel T.F. Zhao H. Cnaan A. Brodeur G.M.

Lett. 1997; 233: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, significantly increased midkine serum levels were detected in cancer patients; ten different types of cancer showed a similar profile of serum midkine level increases (35Ikematsu S. Yano A. Aridome K. Kikuchi M. Kumai H. Nagano H. Okamoto K. Oda M. Sakuma S. Aikou T. Muramatsu H. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 83: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in cases of gastric carcinoma and lung carcinoma, elevated serum midkine levels were found even at stage I. Because this enhanced expression sharply contrasts with the very restricted expression pattern of MK mRNA in normal tissues, we decided to study directly whether MK expression could support tumor growth and perhaps serve as an angiogenesis factor. We subcloned the human MK cDNA into a eukaryotic expression vector downstream of the CMV immediate early gene promoter and generated transfected cells that express and secrete the full-length MK protein. This secreted MK stimulates the proliferation of human umbilical vein and human brain microvascular endothelial cells as well as the anchorage-independent growth of epithelial SW-13 cells in soft agar. Furthermore, stably transfected SW-13/MK cells form colonies in soft agar and tumors in athymic nude mice. The mechanism of action of MK has been less clear because of the lack of a well defined MK receptor that can transduce the growth factor signal (15Maeda N. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kimura T. Kadomatsu K.

Based on the recent discovery by our laboratory of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) as a receptor for pleiotrophin (43Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16772-16779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), we also tested the hypothesis that ALK may be a receptor for the PTN family member, MK. Here we demonstrate that MK directly binds to ALK and show cross-competition between MK and PTN for binding to ALK. Furthermore, ALK receptor binding of MK as well as MK-induced colony formation of SW-13 cells are inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to the extracellular ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ALK (43Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16772-16779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Finally, in different ALK-positive cell lines, we show signal transduction of MK via PI3K and MAPK pathways. Human brain endothelial cells (gift of Drs. P. Costello and R. L. Martuza, Dept. of Neurosurgery, Georgetown University) were isolated as primary cultures from the cerebellum and carried in 199E medium (Biofluids Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were from Clonetics, Walkersville, MD, and SH SY-5Y cells were a gift of Dr. V. Movsesyan (Dept. of Neuroscience, Georgetown University). The other cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and were kept in improved minimal essential medium or Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Biofluids Inc., Rockville, MD) with 10% fetal bovine serum. pMKHC4 contains the human MK cDNA clone as an EcoRI fragment and was a gift of Dr. A. Seddon (Lederle, Wayne, NJ) (44Ostrander M. Fingar H. Seddon A. Bohlen P. Backer J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1189-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The HindIII fragment of pMKHC4 containing the complete MK open reading frame and part (70 nucleotides) of the 5′-untranslated region of the MK1 transcript, was isolated from low melting point agarose and subcloned into the HindIII site of the pRc/CMV expression vector (Invitrogen) (23Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Czubayko F. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21358-21363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most 3′ 143 nucleotides of the MK untranslated region, including the polyadenylation signal, were deleted during the cloning process. The resulting plasmid, pRc/MK, coding for an mRNA of about 0.9 kb, was used for transfections. pRc/CMV (empty control vector) and pRc/MK plasmid DNAs were purified, and cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate/BES method as described previously (23Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25889-25897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were cultivated in the presence of G418 (250 μg/ml of medium; Invitrogen) to generate stably transfected cell lines. Clonal cell lines were obtained by diluting cell suspensions of transfected cells to ∼1 cell/100 μl of medium and plating 100-μl aliquots in 96-well plates in the presence of G418. After 2 weeks, the wells showing growth of an individual clone were harvested and expanded. Clones where analyzed for MK protein expression by immunological detection using a protein slot blot assay. The transfection of ALK into 32D cells was described previously (43Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16772-16779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The generation and characterization of U87MG cells that express ALK-targeted ribozymes were described very recently (54Powers C. Aigner A. Stoica G.E. McDonnell K. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14153-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In brief, ribozyme expression vectors that target the ALK mRNA were generated and shown to deplete stably transfected U87MG cells of their endogenous ALK. Using a series of cells, we reported that the reduction of ALK expression is paralleled by a reduction in the response of the cells to PTN. Furthermore, the reduction of ALK led to reduced xenograft tumor growth and increased apoptosis in the tumors (54Powers C. Aigner A. Stoica G.E. McDonnell K. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14153-14158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). One of the paired U87MG/U87MG Rz cell lines from that study with a reduction of endogenous ALK mRNA by approximately 70% was also used in the present studies to assess the role of ALK for MK signal transduction. One hundred ml of medium conditioned for 24 h by SW-13 cells (wild-type or transfected cells) was loaded onto 1-ml heparin-Sepharose columns (AmershamBiosciences) and washed, and the bound proteins were eluted with a step gradient of 3 ml each of 0.4, 0.9, and 2.0 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) as described for the purification of PTN (45Wellstein A.

Anchorage-independent growth assays of SW-13 cells in soft agar were carried out as described earlier, by growing 20,000 cells in 0.35% bactoagar on a bottom layer of solidified 0.6% bactoagar in 35-mm dishes (45Wellstein A. Fang W.J. Khatri A., Lu, Y. Swain S.S. Dickson R.B. Sasse J. Riegel A.T. Lippman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2582-2587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Wellstein A. Lupu R.

In some experiments the ability of transfected SW-13 cells to stimulate anchorage-independent growth of wild-type SW-13 was tested in a co-culture assay. A feeder layer of 2,000 cells was allowed to attach overnight to 35-mm dishes. After removal of the medium, this feeder layer of cells was covered with 1 ml of 0.6% agar, which was allowed to solidify. Finally, a top layer was added (0.8 ml of a 0.35% agar) containing 20,000 wild-type SW-13 cells as indicators of diffusible growth factors released from the feeder layer cells. After 2–3 weeks colonies in the top layer were counted using an inverted microscope equipped with a measuring grid. The size exclusion limit for positive colony counting was >60 μm in diameter. The colony formation induced by control cells was used as background and was in the range of 5 to 10 colonies depending on the experiment. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human brain endothelial cells were plated in 24- or 96-well plates at 10,000 or 2,000 cells, respectively. In 1 or 0.2 ml, respectively, of growth medium, aliquots from heparin-affinity purified conditioned medium from transfected cells were included as indicated. FGF-2 added to the medium (10 ng/ml final concentration; R&D Systems) served as a positive control. After 3–5 days the cells were trypsinized and counted in a particle counter (24-well assay) or stained with Mosmann's tetrazolium dye (96-well assay; Promega, Madison WI), and the absorbance was read at 630 nm. Female athymic nude mice (Ncr nu/nu; Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were injected subcutaneously into each flank with 1 million cells in 100 μl of medium and observed for tumor formation as described (23Fang W.

This antigen was described earlier and was used previously to generate rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the LBD (43Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D.

A different protein produced in mammalian cells was used for the screening of mouse sera and hybridoma supernatants. The complete extracellular domain (ECD) of ALK was expressed as a secreted protein in SW-13 cells by subcloning the ECD (49Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N. Arakawa T. Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA with a C-terminal Myc/His tag. This construct, including the original secretory signal sequence at the N terminus, was stably transfected and expressed in SW-13 cells, and the secreted ECD protein was isolated from the cell supernatants. To generate hybridoma cells producing antibodies of interest, spleen cells from an immunized mouse showing a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay signal with the ECD protein was used for fusion with FOX-NY myeloma cells based on a protocol of Koehler and Milstein (50Koehler G. Milstein C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1976; 6: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). The complete ALK ECD was then used to screen individual hybridoma clones by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of αLBD antibodies. The antibodies used in the present studies were derived from supernatants of two different hybridoma, 16G2-3 and 9C10-5, and are renamed here for easier identification as αLBD1 and αLBD2, respectively. The hybridoma supernatants were used at a 1:25 dilution for the experiments in Fig. 3. Subconfluent cell monolayers of COS-1 cells transiently transfected for 24 h with the ALK expression vector described previously (43Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C.

After two washes in cold PBS, 300,000 intact cells were incubated under gentle rotation in 0.4 ml of hybridoma supernatants for 15 min at 4 °C. After three further washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were incubated in 0.4 ml of a 1:200 dilution of goat anti-mouse-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 15 min at 4 °C. After three additional washes with ice-cold PBS, cell pellets were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Fixed cell pellets were resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of 0.3% paraformaldehyde. A FACstar Plus instrument (BD PharMingen) was used to measure the fluorescent intensity (mean value of 10,000 cells). The detection of phospho-Akt, Akt, phospho-Erk1/2 and Erk1/2 was performed as described (51Souttou B. Ahmad S. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol.

The anti-ALK antibody used for Western blots was a rabbit polyclonal antibody from Sanbio Inc. (Uden, Netherlands). For immunoprecipitation a mouse monoclonal antibody from Dako (Carpinteria, CA) was used. Both of these antibodies are raised against intracellular epitopes of ALK. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (No. 05-321) and the agarose-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) were from U. S. Biochemicals Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Lysates were prepared from cells grown in 6-well plates (BD PharMingen) for 24 h and then starved in serum-free medium for 16 h before treatment and lysis. SW-13 cells were chosen as a model cell line to study biological effects of MK because these cells express ALK and respond to the MK-related growth factor pleiotrophin (43Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16772-16779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We transfected these cells with a human MK cDNA or with the empty expression vector and selected stably G418-resistant clonal cell lines for further studies. Conditioned media from these cells were concentrated and partially purified using heparin affinity chromatography with a step gradient similar to that employed earlier during the purification of PTN (45Wellstein A. Fang W.J. Khatri A., Lu, Y. Swain S.S. Dickson R.B. Sasse J. Riegel A.T. Lippman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2582-2587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After heparin affinity purification, only the 0.9m NaCl eluate from conditioned media of MK-positive cells contained immunoreactive MK (not shown), and immunoblot analysis of supernatants of the different cell lines showed that only four of seven pRc/MK stably transfected cell lines secreted detectable amounts of MK (Fig. 1 A,bottom). Using recombinant MK as a standard, we estimated that clones MK-4, MK-6, MK-7, and MK-8 secrete between 10 and 20 ng of immunoreactive MK/ml of conditioned medium. No immunoreactive MK was detected in the supernatants of wild-type SW-13 cells, G418-resistant controls transfected with the empty vector (pRc/CMV) or of three of the G418-resistant MK transfectants (Fig. 1 A,bottom). In the latter three clones, the expression unit for MK was most likely lost or disrupted during the stable integration of the expression vector into the genome, and only the G-418 resistance gene was expressed. This is expected for a fraction of stably transfected cells only selected for their drug resistan"

We demonstrate that exposure of MCF-7 cells to the death-inducing ligand, TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), results in rapid Smac release from mitochondria, which occurs before or in parallel with loss of cytochrome c. Smac release is inhibited by Bcl-2/Bcl-xL or by a pan-caspase inhibitor demonstrating that this event is caspase-dependent and modulated by Bcl-2 family members. Following release, Smac is rapidly degraded by the proteasome, an effect suppressed by co-treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. As the RING finger domain of XIAP possesses ubiquitin-protein ligase activity and XIAP binds tightly to mature Smac, an in vitroubiquitination assay was performed which revealed that XIAP functions as a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) in the ubiquitination of Smac. Both the association of XIAP with Smac and the RING finger domain of XIAP are essential for ubiquitination, suggesting that the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of XIAP may promote the rapid degradation of mitochondrial-released Smac.

Two major apoptotic pathways have been identified: one activated via death receptor activation and the other by stress-inducing stimuli (1Bratton S.B. MacFarlane M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Triggering of cell surface death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, including CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL),1 result in a rapid activation of caspase-8 following its recruitment to a trimerized receptor/ligand complex via adaptor molecules (2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar). Second, stress-induced apoptosis caused by chemicals and growth factor deprivation results in perturbation of mitochondria and the ensuing release of proteins, such as cytochrome c, from the intermitochondrial membrane space (3Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once released cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1, which in the presence of dATP results in the recruitment and activation of caspase-9 (4Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M.

The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is also regulated, in part, by Bcl-2 family members with anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic members inhibiting or promoting the release, respectively (7Kluck R.M.

The activated initiator caspases-8 and -9 then activate the effector caspases-3, -6, and -7, which are responsible for the cleavage of important cellular substrates resulting in the classical biochemical and morphological changes associated with the apoptotic phenotype (11Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar, 12Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar).Caspase activity is also regulated by the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), which are characterized by one or more baculovirus IAP repeats, called BIR domains that are responsible for their anti-apoptotic activity (14Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar, 15Holcik M. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 550-556Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and in some IAPs a RING finger domain near their COOH terminus. One major function of IAPs, particularly XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2, is their propensity to bind to and inhibit the processed forms of key initiator and effector caspases, including caspase-9, -3, and -7 (14Deveraux Q.L.

Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). XIAP has also recently been shown to bind to and inhibit active caspase-9 and -3 within the apoptosome complex (17Srinivasula S.M. Hedge R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.-A.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).Protein ubiquitination is a post-translational protein modification that involves the sequential action of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) (19Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Recently, the RING finger domain has been implicated in the ubiquitination of proteins with a functional relationship being established between the RING finger and ubiquitin ligase activity (20Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar,21Joazeiro C.A.P. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Several E3s, including Mdm2, are highly homologous to IAP with respect to their RING finger domains and promote degradation of both themselves and specific substrates, such as p53 (22Fang S.

Recent reports indicate that XIAP and c-IAP1 promote self-ubiquitination in response to apoptotic stimuli (23Yang Y. Fang Y. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar) and that both XIAP and c-IAP2 promotein vitro ubiquitination of caspase-3 and -7 (24Huang H. Joazeiro C.A.P. Bonfoco E.

A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar)Recently, a novel protein Smac (secondmitochondria-derived activator ofcaspases), and its murine homologue DIABLO, were described which promote caspase activation by eliminating IAP inhibition of caspases (26Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2886) Google Scholar, 27Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). Smac is synthesized as a 239-amino acid precursor protein, with the NH2-terminal 55 amino acids serving as a mitochondrial matrix-targeting signal. In response to apoptotic stimuli, mature Smac is released into the cytoplasm and binds to XIAP, thereby relieving XIAP inhibition of caspases. Recently this interaction has been mapped to the NH2-terminal 20 amino acids of mature Smac, and removal of this region completely blocks its ability to bind XIAP (28Chai J., Du, C., Wu, J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 29Srinivasula S.M. Datta P. Fan X.-J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Huang Z. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36152-36157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). As Smac acts to prevent IAP activity, it is proposed to be a human equivalent of the Drosophila proteins Reaper, Grim, and Hid (26Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2886) Google Scholar, 27Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). However, we have shown recently that Smac β, a Smac variant lacking the NH2-terminal IAP binding domain, still potentiates apoptosis, suggesting that Smac may also possess proapoptotic activity independent of its IAP inhibition (30Roberts D.L. Merrison W. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).In this study, we investigate the kinetics and modulation of Smac release from mitochondria following death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Caspase-8 is the most apical caspase in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells (31MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and is recruited to the native TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) in various cell types (32Sprick M.R.

MacFarlane M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34743-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In MCF-7 cells, which are caspase-3 null (35Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar), TRAIL induces rapid Bid cleavage resulting in engagement of the mitochondrial amplification loop that is essential for apoptosis in certain cells (31MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells therefore provide a good model in which to study death receptor-mediated, and hence apical caspase-induced, release of pro-apoptotic molecules from mitochondria. We now demonstrate that TRAIL induces a rapid release of mitochondrial Smac in MCF-7 cells, which is inhibited by Bcl-2. Once released, Smac is rapidly degraded by the proteasome, an effect promoted in vitro by the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of XIAP. This study identifies Smac as a target for ubiquitination and further demonstrates the versatility of XIAP as a potent inhibitor of apoptosis.DISCUSSIONRecent studies have shown that Smac can act as a potent pro-apoptotic molecule, an effect primarily attributed to its propensity to bind to IAP family proteins (26Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2886) Google Scholar, 27Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar), although other mechanisms cannot be excluded (30Roberts D.L. Merrison W. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, to exert its pro-apoptotic effect Smac must be released from mitochondria, and until now, few studies have investigated the kinetics or modulation of Smac release in intact cells. We now demonstrate that death receptor-mediated apoptosis induces rapid and complete release of mitochondrial Smac, with kinetics similar to that observed for cytochrome c. As studies with Bid-deficient mice have confirmed that Bid is a critical substrate forin vivo signaling by death receptor agonists (42Yin X.-M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), TRAIL-induced release of Smac and cytochrome c in MCF-7 cells is likely to be tBid-dependent. Our observation that z-VAD.FMK prevented the release of both Smac and cytochromec would support this, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that other apical caspase substrates may also play a role. Importantly, our results demonstrate that mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic molecules is an apical caspase-dependent event in receptor-mediated apoptosis. This is in contrast to that recently reported for cell stress-associated mitochondrial Smac release, which is proposed to be a caspase-catalyzed event occurring downstream of cytochrome c release (43Adrain C. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6627-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar).We also show that Smac release in MCF-7 cells is sensitive to inhibition by Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, with Bcl-2 exhibiting greater potency than Bcl-xL. The ability of Bcl-2 family members to inhibit the release of mitochondrial intermemebrane pro-apoptotic molecules, such as cytochrome c, is now well documented (3Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in some experiments, Bcl-2 appeared more potent in preventing Smac than cytochrome c release. Structural analysis revealed that Smac exists as a homodimer (28Chai J., Du, C., Wu, J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), with an apparent molecular mass of ∼100 kDa (26Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2886) Google Scholar), whereas cytochrome c is known to have a monomeric molecular weight of only ∼12 kDa. If Bcl-2 were to act simply by blocking a tBid-induced pore, then one might predict that Smac release would be more readily inhibited than release of cytochromec. Thus, mitochondrial release of Smac and cytochromec may occur by different mechanisms, perhaps involving tBid and/or another as yet unidentified pore-forming molecule.Following its release from mitochondria, Smac was rapidly degraded by the proteasome, an effect we observed in both death receptor-mediated and chemical-induced apoptosis. Recent studies have revealed that XIAP can function as an E3 ligase and promotes the degradation of both itself and its substrates. Until now, the only XIAP substrates identified in vitro have been caspase-3, -7, and -9 (25Suzuki Y. Nakabayashi Y. Takahashi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Thus, XIAP exhibits its anti-apoptotic effect by directly binding to and inhibiting active caspase-3, -7, and -9 (14Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar), but in some circumstances may additionally exert its effect through ubiquitination and degradation of active caspases (25Suzuki Y. Nakabayashi Y. Takahashi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that XIAP can also act as an E3 ligase for Smac and thus may promote the proteasome-mediated degradation of Smac in intact cells. Importantly, the BIR3-RING domain of XIAP was both necessary and sufficient to ubiquitinate Smac in vitro. Structural analysis has revealed that the primary binding of Smac to XIAP occurs via the NH2-terminal four residues of Smac and the BIR3 domain of XIAP, with significantly weaker binding observed between Smac and the BIR2 domain of XIAP (41Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L., Wu, J.-W., Du, C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Smac is proposed to compete with, and thereby antagonize the “caspase inhibitory” effect of XIAP (28Chai J., Du, C., Wu, J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 29Srinivasula S.M. Datta P. Fan X.-J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Huang Z. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Importantly, our data suggest that ubiquitination and degradation of Smac may represent another mechanism for modulating apoptosis. Degradation of small amounts of Smac released from mitochondria would provide a safeguard against inadvertent perturbation of mitochondria and subsequent caspase activation. It may be the case that cells exhibiting high levels of XIAP are protected from apoptosis in several ways: through the ability of XIAP to directly inhibit and degrade caspases and additionally through its ability to bind and target Smac for degradation. Recently, the serine protease Omi/HtrA2, which contains an NH2-terminal AVPS motif similar to that found in mature Smac, was shown to be released from mitochondria and inhibit XIAP by direct binding (44Suzuki Y.

Thus Omi, in addition to being a Smac-like inhibitor of IAP activity, may be another pro-apoptotic molecule with the potential to be regulated by proteasomal degradation. Other E3 ligases, in addition to XIAP, may also target Smac or Omi for proteasomal-mediated degradation. Others have reported that c-IAP2 also possesses E3 ligase activity and can monoubiquitinate caspase-3 and -7in vitro. However, as mature Smac binds preferentially to XIAP, but not c-IAP1 or -2 in intact cells (30Roberts D.L. Merrison W. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that c-IAP2 contributes greatly to the proteasomal-mediated degradation of Smac in vivo.Taken together, our results demonstrate that receptor-mediated Smac release from mitochondria occurs prior to or in parallel with the release of cytochrome c. Once released, Smac is rapidly degraded by the proteasome, an effect we propose from our in vitro data may be mediated in part via the E3 ligase activity of the BIR3-RING domain of XIAP. Based on our results and those of others, apoptosis can now be viewed as a process that has features in common with the control of other cellular processes by ubiquitination. Apoptosis is a form of cell death that is essential for the correct development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms. Two major apoptotic pathways have been identified: one activated via death receptor activation and the other by stress-inducing stimuli (1Bratton S.B. MacFarlane M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Triggering of cell surface death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, including CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL),1 result in a rapid activation of caspase-8 following its recruitment to a trimerized receptor/ligand complex via adaptor molecules (2Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar). Second, stress-induced apoptosis caused by chemicals and growth factor deprivation results in perturbation of mitochondria and the ensuing release of proteins, such as cytochrome c, from the intermitochondrial membrane space (3Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once released cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1, which in the presence of dATP results in the recruitment and activation of caspase-9 (4Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M.

The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is also regulated, in part, by Bcl-2 family members with anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic members inhibiting or promoting the release, respectively (7Kluck R.M.

The activated initiator caspases-8 and -9 then activate the effector caspases-3, -6, and -7, which are responsible for the cleavage of important cellular substrates resulting in the classical biochemical and morphological changes associated with the apoptotic phenotype (11Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4104) Google Scholar, 12Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev.

Caspase activity is also regulated by the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), which are characterized by one or more baculovirus IAP repeats, called BIR domains that are responsible for their anti-apoptotic activity (14Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar, 15Holcik M. Korneluk R.G. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 550-556Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and in some IAPs a RING finger domain near their COOH terminus. One major function of IAPs, particularly XIAP, c-IAP1, and c-IAP2, is their propensity to bind to and inhibit the processed forms of key initiator and effector caspases, including caspase-9, -3, and -7 (14Deveraux Q.L.

Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar). XIAP has also recently been shown to bind to and inhibit active caspase-9 and -3 within the apoptosome complex (17Srinivasula S.M. Hedge R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.-A.

Protein ubiquitination is a post-translational protein modification that involves the sequential action of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) (19Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Recently, the RING finger domain has been implicated in the ubiquitination of proteins with a functional relationship being established between the RING finger and ubiquitin ligase activity (20Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar,21Joazeiro C.A.P. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Several E3s, including Mdm2, are highly homologous to IAP with respect to their RING finger domains and promote degradation of both themselves and specific substrates, such as p53 (22Fang S.

Recent reports indicate that XIAP and c-IAP1 promote self-ubiquitination in response to apoptotic stimuli (23Yang Y. Fang Y. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar) and that both XIAP and c-IAP2 promotein vitro ubiquitination of caspase-3 and -7 (24Huang H. Joazeiro C.A.P. Bonfoco E.

A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) Recently, a novel protein Smac (secondmitochondria-derived activator ofcaspases), and its murine homologue DIABLO, were described which promote caspase activation by eliminating IAP inhibition of caspases (26Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2886) Google Scholar, 27Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). Smac is synthesized as a 239-amino acid precursor protein, with the NH2-terminal 55 amino acids serving as a mitochondrial matrix-targeting signal. In response to apoptotic stimuli, mature Smac is released into the cytoplasm and binds to XIAP, thereby relieving XIAP inhibition of caspases. Recently this interaction has been mapped to the NH2-terminal 20 amino acids of mature Smac, and removal of this region completely blocks its ability to bind XIAP (28Chai J., Du, C., Wu, J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 29Srinivasula S.M. Datta P. Fan X.-J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Huang Z. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36152-36157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). As Smac acts to prevent IAP activity, it is proposed to be a human equivalent of the Drosophila proteins Reaper, Grim, and Hid (26Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2886) Google Scholar, 27Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). However, we have shown recently that Smac β, a Smac variant lacking the NH2-terminal IAP binding domain, still potentiates apoptosis, suggesting that Smac may also possess proapoptotic activity independent of its IAP inhibition (30Roberts D.L. Merrison W. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the kinetics and modulation of Smac release from mitochondria following death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Caspase-8 is the most apical caspase in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells (31MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and is recruited to the native TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) in various cell types (32Sprick M.R.

MacFarlane M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34743-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In MCF-7 cells, which are caspase-3 null (35Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar), TRAIL induces rapid Bid cleavage resulting in engagement of the mitochondrial amplification loop that is essential for apoptosis in certain cells (31MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells therefore provide a good model in which to study death receptor-mediated, and hence apical caspase-induced, release of pro-apoptotic molecules from mitochondria. We now demonstrate that TRAIL induces a rapid release of mitochondrial Smac in MCF-7 cells, which is inhibited by Bcl-2. Once released, Smac is rapidly degraded by the proteasome, an effect promoted in vitro by the ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of XIAP. This study identifies Smac as a target for ubiquitination and further demonstrates the versatility of XIAP as a potent inhibitor of apoptosis. DISCUSSIONRecent studies have shown that Smac can act as a potent pro-apoptotic molecule, an effect primarily attributed to its propensity to bind to IAP family proteins (26Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2886) Google Scholar, 27Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar), although other mechanisms cannot be excluded (30Roberts D.L. Merrison W. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, to exert its pro-apoptotic effect Smac must be released from mitochondria, and until now, few studies have investigated the kinetics or modulation of Smac release in intact cells. We now demonstrate that death receptor-mediated apoptosis induces rapid and complete release of mitochondrial Smac, with kinetics similar to that observed for cytochrome c. As studies with Bid-deficient mice have confirmed that Bid is a critical substrate forin vivo signaling by death receptor agonists (42Yin X.-M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), TRAIL-induced release of Smac and cytochrome c in MCF-7 cells is likely to be tBid-dependent. Our observation that z-VAD.FMK prevented the release of both Smac and cytochromec would support this, however, we cannot exclude the possibility that other apical caspase substrates may also play a role. Importantly, our results demonstrate that mitochondrial release of pro-apoptotic molecules is an apical caspase-dependent event in receptor-mediated apoptosis. This is in contrast to that recently reported for cell stress-associated mitochondrial Smac release, which is proposed to be a caspase-catalyzed event occurring downstream of cytochrome c release (43Adrain C. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6627-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar).We also show that Smac release in MCF-7 cells is sensitive to inhibition by Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, with Bcl-2 exhibiting greater potency than Bcl-xL. The ability of Bcl-2 family members to inhibit the release of mitochondrial intermemebrane pro-apoptotic molecules, such as cytochrome c, is now well documented (3Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, in some experiments, Bcl-2 appeared more potent in preventing Smac than cytochrome c release. Structural analysis revealed that Smac exists as a homodimer (28Chai J., Du, C., Wu, J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), with an apparent molecular mass of ∼100 kDa (26Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2886) Google Scholar), whereas cytochrome c is known to have a monomeric molecular weight of only ∼12 kDa. If Bcl-2 were to act simply by blocking a tBid-induced pore, then one might predict that Smac release would be more readily inhibited than release of cytochromec. Thus, mitochondrial release of Smac and cytochromec may occur by different mechanisms, perhaps involving tBid and/or another as yet unidentified pore-forming molecule.Following its release from mitochondria, Smac was rapidly degraded by the proteasome, an effect we observed in both death receptor-mediated and chemical-induced apoptosis. Recent studies have revealed that XIAP can function as an E3 ligase and promotes the degradation of both itself and its substrates. Until now, the only XIAP substrates identified in vitro have been caspase-3, -7, and -9 (25Suzuki Y. Nakabayashi Y. Takahashi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Thus, XIAP exhibits its anti-apoptotic effect by directly binding to and inhibiting active caspase-3, -7, and -9 (14Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar), but in some circumstances may additionally exert its effect through ubiquitination and degradation of active caspases (25Suzuki Y. Nakabayashi Y. Takahashi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that XIAP can also act as an E3 ligase for Smac and thus may promote the proteasome-mediated degradation of Smac in intact cells. Importantly, the BIR3-RING domain of XIAP was both necessary and sufficient to ubiquitinate Smac in vitro. Structural analysis has revealed that the primary binding of Smac to XIAP occurs via the NH2-terminal four residues of Smac and the BIR3 domain of XIAP, with significantly weaker binding observed between Smac and the BIR2 domain of XIAP (41Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L., Wu, J.-W., Du, C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Smac is proposed to compete with, and thereby antagonize the “caspase inhibitory” effect of XIAP (28Chai J., Du, C., Wu, J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 29Srinivasula S.M. Datta P. Fan X.-J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Huang Z. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Importantly, our data suggest that ubiquitination and degradation of Smac may represent another mechanism for modulating apoptosis. Degradation of small amounts of Smac released from mitochondria would provide a safeguard against inadvertent perturbation of mitochondria and subsequent caspase activation. It may be the case that cells exhibiting high levels of XIAP are protected from apoptosis in several ways: through the ability of XIAP to directly inhibit and degrade caspases and additionally through its ability to bind and target Smac for degradation. Recently, the serine protease Omi/HtrA2, which contains an NH2-terminal AVPS motif similar to that found in mature Smac, was shown to be released from mitochondria and inhibit XIAP by direct binding (44Suzuki Y.

Nakabayashi Y. Takahashi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that XIAP can also act as an E3 ligase for Smac and thus may promote the proteasome-mediated degradation of Smac in intact cells. Importantly, the BIR3-RING domain of XIAP was both necessary and sufficient to ubiquitinate Smac in vitro. Structural analysis has revealed that the primary binding of Smac to XIAP occurs via the NH2-terminal four residues of Smac and the BIR3 domain of XIAP, with significantly weaker binding observed between Smac and the BIR2 domain of XIAP (41Wu G. Chai J. Suber T.L., Wu, J.-W., Du, C. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 408: 1008-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Smac is proposed to compete with, and thereby antagonize the “caspase inhibitory” effect of XIAP (28Chai J., Du, C., Wu, J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y.

Importantly, our data suggest that ubiquitination and degradation of Smac may represent another mechanism for modulating apoptosis. Degradation of small amounts of Smac released from mitochondria would provide a safeguard against inadvertent perturbation of mitochondria and subsequent caspase activation. It may be the case that cells exhibiting high levels of XIAP are protected from apoptosis in several ways: through the ability of XIAP to directly inhibit and degrade caspases and additionally through its ability to bind and target Smac for degradation. Recently, the serine protease Omi/HtrA2, which contains an NH2-terminal AVPS motif similar to that found in mature Smac, was shown to be released from mitochondria and inhibit XIAP by direct binding (44Suzuki Y.

Thus Omi, in addition to being a Smac-like inhibitor of IAP activity, may be another pro-apoptotic molecule with the potential to be regulated by proteasomal degradation. Other E3 ligases, in addition to XIAP, may also target Smac or Omi for proteasomal-mediated degradation. Others have reported that c-IAP2 also possesses E3 ligase activity and can monoubiquitinate caspase-3 and -7in vitro. However, as mature Smac binds preferentially to XIAP, but not c-IAP1 or -2 in intact cells (30Roberts D.L. Merrison W. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that c-IAP2 contributes greatly to the proteasomal-mediated degradation of Smac in vivo. Taken together, our results demonstrate that receptor-mediated Smac release from mitochondria occurs prior to or in parallel with the release of cytochrome c. Once released, Smac is rapidly degraded by the proteasome, an effect we propose from our in vitro data may be mediated in part via the E3 ligase activity of the BIR3-RING domain of XIAP. Based on our results and those of others, apoptosis can now be viewed as a process that has features in common with the control of other cellular processes by ubiquitination. We thank Dr. E. S.

The mechanism by which E. colitransports newly synthesized lipid A from its site of biosynthesis at the inner face of the inner membrane to the outer membrane is not fully understood. Recent studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that export of both lipid A and glycerophospholipids requires the inner membrane protein MsbA (10Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C.

MsbA is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, is closely related to mammalian multidrug-resistance (MDR) proteins, and is required for growth ofE. coli (12Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 1221-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Zhou et al.

More recently, we have isolated a novel, temperature-sensitive E. colipoint mutant of MsbA (designated WD2) and have shown that loss of MsbA function results in rapid cessation of cell growth, accompanied by accumulation of lipid A and phospholipids in the inner membrane and formation of inner membrane invaginations visible by electron microscopy (11Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). MsbA in WD2 contains a single amino acid substitution (A270T) located in its fifth transmembrane span (Fig. 1 B). Our genetic evidence strongly suggests that MsbA functions as a general lipid transporter, or flippase, playing a key role in the movement of lipids from the inner membrane to the outer membrane of E. coli (11Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although there is no evidence that MsbA confers multidrug resistance in E. coli, the related LmrA protein ofLactococcus lactis does in fact confer resistance to many of the same amphiphilic compounds that are transported by MDR1 (16van Veen H.W.

It was predicted to contain a classical ABC domain at its C terminus and a hydrophobic region at its N terminus, consisting of six transmembrane spans (11Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J.

Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The proposed topology and dimeric structure of MsbA were validated recently by the crystal structure (18Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) at 4.5 Å resolution (Fig.1 B). MsbA contains an intriguing cleft, oriented toward the cytoplasm, between its two subunits (Fig. 1 B) (18Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The cleft is lined with basic amino acids, and it is sufficient in size to accommodate lipid A or several glycerophospholipid molecules (18Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). ATP binding and hydrolysis presumably drive a conformational change that results in lipid extrusion to the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane (Fig. 1) (18Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The A270T substitution is situated at a critical site near the periplasmic surface in the MsbA molecule (Fig. 1 B), consistent with the lipid transport defect seen in WD2 at 42 °C. Previous studies have shown that the intrinsic ATPase activity of MDR proteins and other ABC transporters, when purified and reconstituted into liposomes, can be stimulated by physiologic concentrations of transported substrates (19Ambudkar S.V.

To develop functional assays for MsbA and to elucidate its role in lipid export, we have expressed the protein as an N-terminal hexahistidine fusion, purified it to near homogeneity, and reconstituted it into liposomes. The ATPase activity of purified MsbA is dependent upon the presence of phospholipids and is stimulated further by Kdo2-lipid A. LDAO was purchased from Fluka Biochemika. DDM was purchased from Sigma. E. coli phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Bio-Beads were from Bio-Rad, and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin was from Qiagen. Tryptone and yeast extract were from Difco. All other chemicals were reagent grade and purchased from either Sigma or Mallinckrodt. The E. coli msbAgene was amplified from W3110 genomic DNA by PCR with Pfuturbo (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The forward primer was 5′-ATG CTG GTT TTT CAT ATGCAT AAC GAC-3′ (NdeI site underlined), and the reverse primer was 5′-CGG GAT CCT CGA GTC ATT GGC CAA ACT GCA TTT TG-3′ (BamHI site underlined). ThemsbA initiation and termination codons in the primers are italicized. These primers were used at a final concentration of 2.5 ng/μl in a 100-μl PCR mixture containing 100 ng of genomic DNA and 5 units of Pfu polymerase. The reaction conditions were as follows: a 94 °C denaturation for 1 min followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C (denature) for 1 min, 55 °C (anneal) for 1 min, and 72 °C (extension) for 2 min. This was followed by a 10-min runoff at 72 °C. The gel-purified PCR product was digested withNdeI and BamHI (New England Biolabs) and ligated into an NdeI/BamHI-digested and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)-treated pET28b vector (Novagen) to give vector pWTD1. Vector pWTD7, containing the temperature-sensitive MsbA allele (A270T), was constructed in an identical manner starting from genomic DNA from strain WD2 (11Doerrler W.T. Reedy M.C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11461-11464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Vector pWTD3 was constructed by cloning the XbaI/HindIII fragment of pWTD1 (containing the in-frame hexahistidine tag and ribosomal binding site) into an XbaI/HindIII and shrimp alkaline phosphatase-treated vector pACYC184 (New England Biolabs). All plasmids were sequenced at the Duke University sequencing facility and found to be free of errors. Genomic DNA was prepared using the Easy-DNA kit from Invitrogen. pWTD1 was transformed into Novablue (DE3) cells (Novagen). A single kanamycin-resistant colony was inoculated into 5 ml of LB broth (24Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar) (adjusted to pH 7.0 and containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin) and grown at 37 °C overnight. The overnight culture was diluted 100-fold into 500 ml of LB broth containing kanamycin, and the cells were grown at 37 °C until A 600 reached 0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm. Growth was continued at 30 °C for 3 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min. All subsequent steps were carried out at 0–4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and were broken by passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i. The crude lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Membranes were prepared by two sequential ultracentrifugation steps at 100,000 × g for 60 min with a wash of the first membrane pellet in 10 ml of 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer A). The final membrane pellet was homogenized in buffer A at a protein concentration of ∼5 mg/ml. LDAO was added to the washed membranes (5 mg/ml in buffer A) to a final concentration of 2% (w/v) and incubated with rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 125,000 × g for 1 h. The soluble fraction was adjusted to 10 mm imidazole and loaded onto a preequilibrated nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. After washes with 5 column volumes of 10 mm and then with 5 column volumes of 50 mm imidazole in buffer A containing 0.1% DDM, protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of 200 mm imidazole in buffer A containing 0.1% DDM. For reconstitution of the purified protein, E. coliphospholipids (polar lipid extract, Avanti) were dried under a stream of nitrogen and then subjected to sonic irradiation for 5 min in a bath sonicator at a concentration of 25 mg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The liposomes were frozen on dry ice, thawed slowly at room temperature, and then homogenized by five passages through a 27-gauge needle. The liposomes were diluted to a concentration of 4 mg/ml in the above buffer, and DDM was added to solubilize the system to generate mixed micelles (1 μmol of DDM/mg of lipid). Solubilization was followed spectrophotometrically at 540 nm (25Paternostre M.T. Roux M. Rigaud J.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2668-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). PurifiedN-His6-MsbA was added to the lipid/DDM mixed micelles at a protein:lipid ratio of 1:100 (w/w). The mixture was incubated with gentle agitation at room temperature for 30 min. Bio-Beads (previously washed extensively with methanol and then water) were added at 80 mg/ml. The system was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and then for 2 h and for 16 h at 4 °C after the addition of fresh Bio-Beads. The final proteoliposomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation at 125,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. They were resuspended at 0.25 mg of protein/ml in buffer A containing 1 mm dithiothreitol instead of β-mercaptoethanol and stored at −80 °C. All ATPase assays were carried out using proteoliposomes that had undergone a freeze/thaw step and had been passed through a 27-gauge needle several times. Purified MsbA protein in 0.1% DDM or reconstituted into vesicles was assayed for ATPase activity at a protein concentration of ∼1–10 μg/ml in a 150-μl reaction mixture containing (final concentrations) 50 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP. In assays containing 0.1% DDM, 10% glycerol was also included. If exogenous lipids or inhibitors were included in the assay, a 15-min preincubation of all components on ice was included before the incubation at 37 °C. ATPase reactions were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 150 μl of 12% SDS. The amounts of Pi released were determined by a colorimetric method, as described by Gonzalez-Romo et al. (26Gonzalez-Romo P. Sanchez-Nieto S. Gavilanes-Ruiz M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), using potassium phosphate as the standard. After the addition of SDS, 300 μl of a solution containing equal volumes of 12% ascorbic acid in 1m HCl and 2% ammonium molybdate in 1 m HCl was added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. This was followed by the addition of 450 μl of an aqueous solution of 2% sodium citrate, 2% sodium metaarsenite, and 2% acetic acid. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, absorbance was measured at 850 nm. The assay was linear in the range of 6–400 μmPi. WBB06 cells (27Brabetz W. Muller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were grown overnight at 37 °C to A 600 ∼3.5 in 2 liters of LB broth adjusted to pH 7.0 and supplemented with 12 μg/ml tetracycline. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 ×g for 10 min, washed with an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (28Dulbecco R. Vogt M. J. Exp. Med. 1954; 99: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2000) Google Scholar), and resuspended in 160 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Chloroform and methanol were added to give a single-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture consisting of chloroform:methanol:phosphate-buffered saline (1:2:0.8, v/v) (29Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). The cells were extracted for 1 h at room temperature with frequent mixing. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant, containing the glycerophospholipids and Kdo2-lipid A, was removed. It was converted to a two-phase Bligh-Dyer system by the addition of chloroform and water to give the mixture chloroform:methanol:water (2:2:1.8, v/v) (29Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42878) Google Scholar). After thorough mixing, the phases were separated by centrifugation as described above, and the upper phase was washed with a fresh, preequilibrated Bligh-Dyer lower phase. The lower phases were pooled, washed once with a fresh, preequilibrated Bligh-Dyer upper phase, and dried in a rotary evaporator. The dried lipids were redissolved in 10 ml of chloroform:methanol:water (2:3:1, v/v) and applied to a 2-ml DEAE-cellulose column (Whatman DE52), equilibrated as the acetate form in the same solvent mixture (30Raetz C.R.H.

The column was washed with 2 column volumes of chloroform:methanol:water (2:3:1, v/v) and eluted with 5 column volumes each of chloroform:methanol:aqueous ammonium acetate (at 60, 120, 240, 360, or 480 mm) (2:3:1, v/v) (31Raetz C.R.H.

Phosphatidylethanolamine was not bound to the column, whereas phosphatidylglycerol and other phospholipids eluted in the 60–120 mm fractions. The Kdo2-lipid A 1,4′-bis-phosphate species eluted in the 240 mmfraction, but the Kdo2-lipid A 1-pyrophosphate variant (32Zhou Z. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

The fractions containing the purified Kdo2-lipid A 1,4′-bis-phosphate were pooled and converted to a neutral two-phase Bligh-Dyer system by the addition of appropriate amounts of chloroform and water. The lower phase was neutralized with a few drops of pyridine and was dried under a stream of nitrogen. It was then resuspended with sonic irradiation for 2 min in a bath apparatus in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and stored at −80 °C. The elution of the various lipids from the DEAE column was monitored by spotting ∼5-μl samples onto Silica Gel 60 TLC plates followed by development in a solvent containing chloroform, pyridine, 88% formic acid, and water (50:50:16:5, v/v), and visualization by sulfuric acid charring. The amount of purified lipid was quantified by complete acid hydrolysis in 50 μl of 5 m HCl at 100 °C for 16 h followed by measurement of the released Pi, using the phosphate assay described above (26Gonzalez-Romo P. Sanchez-Nieto S. Gavilanes-Ruiz M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Potassium phosphate samples were run in parallel to generate a standard curve. The final yield of Kdo2-lipid A 1,4′-bis-phosphate was ∼5 mg from 2 liters of cells. The Kdo2-lipid A from strain WBB06 was greater than 95% pure as judged by TLC analysis followed by sulfuric acid charring, and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (data not shown). Lipid X was isolated from E. coli MN7 (34Nishijima M. Bulawa C.E. Raetz C.R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 113-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described by Radika and Raetz (35Radika K.

Free hexaacylated lipid A was prepared by pH 4.5 hydrolysis at 100 °C from either RaLPS or Kdo2-lipid A (10Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

All lipids suspended in aqueous buffers were dispersed before use by sonic irradiation for 1 min in a bath sonicator. Protein samples were denatured at 100 °C for 5 min and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Prestained low range standards from Bio-Rad were used to estimate protein molecular weights. Protein concentrations were determined with the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. To facilitate purification, the E. coli msbA gene was cloned into pET28b behind the T7 promoter in-frame with an N-terminal His6 tag. This expression plasmid was designated pWTD1 (Table I). The His-tagged protein, when expressed on the low copy vector pWTD3 (a pACYC184 derivative), was functional as judged by its ability to complement the growth at 44 °C of the MsbA temperature-sensitive mutant WD2 (data not shown).Table IRelevant strains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidDescriptionSource or referenceE. coliW3110Wild type, F−, λ−E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale UniversityWD2W3110, aroA::Tn10 msbA2 (A270T)11Doerrler W.T.

The His-tagged MsbA fusion protein was solubilized efficiently from membranes using 2% LDAO and was purified by nickel affinity chromatography (Fig. 2). During chromatography the detergent was changed to DDM. The protein was greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2). A typical preparation yielded ∼3 mg of purified MsbA protein from 30 mg of washed membranes. Using a colorimetric assay for released Pi (26Gonzalez-Romo P. Sanchez-Nieto S. Gavilanes-Ruiz M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we found that the ATPase specific activity of the purified, detergent-solubilized MsbA was low, typically in the range of 2–4 nmol/min/mg (Fig. 3,top panel). The addition of E. coliphospholipids to the assay system at concentrations above 2 mg/ml greatly stimulated and stabilized the ATPase activity (Fig. 3,middle panel). Phospholipids at 2 mg/ml or above would be expected to form vesicles, even in the presence of 0.1% (1 mg/ml) DDM. However, the addition of Kdo2-lipid A at low micromolar concentrations also resulted in stimulation of ATPase activity (Fig. 3,bottom panel). At this relatively low concentration the lipid should form mixed micelles with the nonionic detergent (37Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In light of the results shown in Fig. 3, we routinely reconstituted the solubilized MsbA protein into liposomes at a protein:lipid ratio of 1:100 (w/w). Proteoliposomes were prepared fromE. coli phospholipids and purified MsbA, both solubilized with DDM, followed by treatment with Bio-Beads to remove the detergent as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The MsbA-containing proteoliposomes were found to have an intrinsic ATPase activity that was nearly linear with time at 37 °C for 2 h, and with a protein concentration up to at least 2 μg/150 μl of reaction mixture (Fig. 4, A andB). Using 2 mm ATP, a magnesium ion concentration of 10 mm (Fig. 4 C) and pH values ranging from 7 to 8.5 (data not shown) were optimal. TheV max of the reconstituted protein was 37 nmol/min/mg, and the apparent Km for ATP was 878 μm (Fig. 5). Th"

Null mutations in theROMK gene cause type II Bartter's syndrome, in which abnormalities of electrolyte, acid-base, and fluid-volume homeostasis occur because of defective NaCl reabsorption in the TALH. To understand better the pathogenesis of type II Bartter's syndrome, we developed a mouse lacking ROMK and examined its phenotype. Young null mutants had hydronephrosis, were severely dehydrated, and ∼95% died before 3 weeks of age. ROMK-deficient mice that survived beyond weaning grew to adulthood; however, they had metabolic acidosis, elevated blood concentrations of Na+ and Cl−, reduced blood pressure, polydipsia, polyuria, and poor urinary concentrating ability. Whole kidney glomerular filtration rate was sharply reduced, apparently as a result of hydronephrosis, and fractional excretion of electrolytes was elevated. Micropuncture analysis revealed that the single nephron glomerular filtration rate was relatively normal, absorption of NaCl in the TALH was reduced but not eliminated, and tubuloglomerular feedback was severely impaired.

Na+ and Cl−, in a 1:2 ratio, are absorbed across the apical membrane of TALH cells by the coupled activities of NKCC2 and ROMK and extruded via the basolateral Na+,K+-ATPase and chloride channel (6Estevez R.

Physiol. 1998; 275: F325-F327PubMed Google Scholar); additional Na+ is absorbed via the paracellular pathway. Although NKCC2 directly mediates uptake of Na+, K+, and Cl−, the activity of ROMK is critical because the K+ concentration in the luminal fluid is much lower than that of Na+ and Cl−. Thus, the continuous electroneutral uptake of Na+, K+, and Cl− requires that K+ be recycled to the lumen of the tubule. Apical K+ secretion via ROMK replenishes luminal K+ and also contributes, in concert with basolateral Cl− efflux via CLC-KB/barttin (5Birkenhager R. Otto E. Schurmann M.J. Vollmer M. Ruf E.M.

The different types of Bartter's syndrome, caused by null mutations in NKCC2, ROMK, CLC-KB, and barttin, are referred to as types I–IV, respectively. The syndrome is thus heterogeneous, consistent with the variety in genetic mechanisms, and the physiological phenotypes overlap to some degree with those of Gitelman's syndrome, a milder hypokalemic alkalosis caused by null mutations in the thiazide-sensitive NaCl cotransporter of the distal convoluted tubule (9Simon D.B.

Detailed analysis of the physiological functions and relative importance of the transporters involved in each type of Bartter's syndrome would be facilitated by the development of knockout mouse models. A mouse model for Bartter's syndrome type I, involving NKCC2, has already been developed (11Takahashi N. Chernavvsky D.R. Gomez R.A. Igarashi P. Gitelman H.J. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

There are multiple N-terminal variants of ROMK (gene locusKcnj1) (12Shuck M.E. Bock J.H. Benjamin C.W. Tsai T.D. Lee K.S. Slightom J.L. Bienkowski M.J. J. Biol.

One or more of these variants is expressed in the TALH, distal convoluted tubule, connecting tubule, collecting duct, and macula densa (15Lee W.S. Hebert S.C. Am. J.

The broad distribution of ROMK in the renal nephron, in contrast to the restricted distribution of NKCC2, and the possibility that other apical K+ channels (17Wang W. Hebert S.C. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 413-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) or K+-independent modes of NaCl transport for NKCC2 (19Plata C. Meade P. Hall A. Welch R.C. Vazquez N. Hebert S.C. Gamba G. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F574-F582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) might provide some compensation for its absence, suggested that the loss of ROMK might lead to a different phenotype than that of theNkcc2 knockout. In this study we have developed a mouse model for Bartter's syndrome type II, involving ROMK. ROMK-deficient mice have hydronephrosis, polydipsia, polyuria, extracellular fluid volume depletion, and a urinary concentrating defect. This phenotype is similar to that of theNkcc2 knockout, although it is not as severe, suggesting that renal Na+ handling is perturbed less by the loss of ROMK than by the loss of NKCC2. To examine this possibility we performed micropuncture analysis of a single nephron function. These experiments revealed that tubuloglomerular feedback is severely impaired and that Na+ reabsorption is significantly reduced but not eliminated in the TALH of the Romk knockout. The latter observation supports the hypothesis that ROMK plays an essential role in K+ recycling in the TALH, which is required for maximum Na+ reabsorption via NKCC2, and also shows that a significant amount of Na+ reabsorption does take place in its absence. A phage library prepared using genomic DNA from a 129/SvJ mouse was screened with a RomkcDNA probe. Clones containing the Romk gene were isolated and analyzed by restriction endonuclease mapping. Two restriction fragments containing sequences from the large core exon were inserted into the MJK-KO targeting vector (20Meneton P. Schultheis P.J. Greeb J. Nieman M.L. Liu L.H. Clarke L.L.

A 3.8-kb BglII fragment terminating with codon 181 was inserted between the 3′-end of the neomycin resistance gene and the 5′-end of the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene, and a 2.8 kb BglII fragment beginning with codon 182 was inserted between the 5′-end of the neomycin resistance gene and vector sequences. The targeting construct was linearized and electroporated into embryonic stem cells derived from 129/SvJ mice, which were then cultured in the presence of G418 and gancyclovir as described previously (20Meneton P. Schultheis P.J. Greeb J. Nieman M.L. Liu L.H. Clarke L.L. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). DNA was isolated from cells that survived the selection procedure and analyzed by Southern blot analysis using a 2-kb HindIII-BglII fragment from the region just 5′ to fragments used to prepare the targeting construct. Blastocyst-mediated transgenesis was performed, chimeric mice were bred with Black Swiss mice, and a colony carrying the null allele was established by breeding heterozygous mutant mice. These studies and the experiments described below were performed in accordance with the guidelines established by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. DNA from tail biopsies was analyzed by PCR using a three primer set. A 275-bp fragment from the wild-type gene was amplified using a forward primer (5′-GTGACAGAACAGTGTGCC-3′) corresponding to codons 149–154 and a reverse primer (5′-CTCCTTCAGGTGTGATGG-3′) corresponding to anticodons 240–234. A 385-bp product from the mutant gene was amplified using the reverse primer from the Romk gene and a primer (5′-CTGACTAGGGGAGGAGTAGAAGG-3′) complementary to sequences in the 5′-untranslated region of the neomycin resistance gene. Total RNA was isolated from pooled kidneys of 8-day-old Romk −/−(n = 10) and Romk +/+(n = 6) mice and from individual adultRomk −/− and Romk +/+mice using Tri-ReagentTM (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Blots were prepared, hybridized, and washed as described previously (21Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J.

At postnatal day 7–9, pups were sacrificed by decapitation, and trunk blood was collected into heparinized tubes for analysis on a Chiron model 448 (Chiron Diagnostics, Medfield, MA) blood gas analyzer. Urine was collected from the bladder, and electrolytes were analyzed by flame photometry (Corning model 480, Medfield, MA). Kidneys collected from 7–9-day-old and adult Romk +/+ andRomk −/− mice were prepared for routine light and electron microscopic histology and morphometry (22Flagella M. Clarke L.L. Miller M.L.

SevenRomk −/− and 11 Romk +/+mice were used, with approximately equal numbers of young, old, male, and female mice. Phase-contrast microscopy of toluidine blue-stained, 1.5-μm thick plastic sections was used to quantify the relative amounts of proximal and distal tubule, and of glomeruli, in the kidney cortex subadjacent to the capsule (to correlate with those nephrons analyzed by micropuncture). A grid of 75 intersections was visualized on the light microscopic image using a camera lucida, and the number of positive intersections lying over glomerular, proximal, and distal tubular cells was determined. Proximal tubular cells were identified as those with brush-border membranes and nuclei close to the basal membrane, whereas distal tubular cells were identified as those with no brush-border and more apically located nuclei. The volume density of each of these was determined by dividing the number of intersections found over each tubule type by the total number of intersections lying over all the tissue. In addition, a subjective appraisal of the degree of mitochondrial organization at the base of the tubular cells was made, with 1+ connoting no organization and 6+ being the highly organized and parallel alignment of mitochondria in a perpendicular position relative to the basement membrane. Means and S.E. values were generated using the General Linear model of SAS 6.1. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. AdultRomk −/− mice of either sex (n= 4) and matched Romk +/+ mice (n= 6) were housed individually in conventional shoebox cages for the duration of the experiment, and they were provided a diet of normal rodent chow. Blood pressure measurements were made by tail-cuff using a Visitech Systems BP-2000 blood pressure analyzer (Apex, NC) after 4 days of acclimation to the instrument. Urine concentrating ability was evaluated by measuring osmolality in urine samples obtained by bladder massage before and after 6 h of water deprivation. For the following 3 days, mice were given distilled water to drink, and water intake, body weight, and blood pressure were monitored daily. For the next 3 days, animals were provided with both water and isotonic saline to drink, and measurements were repeated. At the end of the tail-cuff protocol, animals resumed drinking water only and were made available for clearance and micropuncture experiments. Experiments were performed on adult Romk −/− mice of either sex (n = 5) and matched Romk +/+ mice (n = 5). Whole kidney clearance measurements were performed in all of the mice, and micropuncture measurements were made in three mutant and three wild-type mice. Animals were surgically prepared according to conventional techniques modified for use in the mouse as described previously (23Lorenz J.N. Schultheis P.J. Traynor T. Shull G.E. Schnermann J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F447-F453PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with separate intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (50 μg/g of body weight) and thiobutabarbital (Inactin, Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA; 100 μg/g of body weight) and placed on a thermally controlled surgical table. After tracheostomy, the right femoral artery and vein were cannulated with polyethylene tubing hand-drawn to a fine tip over a flame (OD 0.3–0.5 mm). The arterial catheter was connected to a COBE CDXIII fixed dome pressure transducer (COBE Cardiovascular, Arvada, CO) for measurement of arterial blood pressure, and the venous catheter was connected to a syringe pump for infusion. The bladder was also cannulated with flared PE-10 tubing for the collection of urine. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored throughout the experiment using a PowerLab data acquisition system (AD Instruments, Boston) with a sampling rate of 200 samples/s. Body temperature was maintained at 37.5 °C, and animals were provided with a steady stream of 100% O2 to breathe. For micropuncture experiments, the left kidney was exposed via a flank incision, carefully dissected free of adherent fat and connective tissue, placed in a Lucite cup and covered with mineral oil. A 4-μl/g of body weight bolus infusion of isotonic saline containing 0.75 g of fluorescein isothiocyanate-inulin/100 ml (Sigma), 2.25 g of bovine serum albumin/100 ml, and 1.0 g of glucose/100 ml was then administered, followed by a maintenance infusion of the same solution at 0.2 μl/min/g of body weight. After a 30–45-min equilibration period, micropuncture collections and/or urine collections were begun. For micropuncture collections, surface convolutions of the same nephron were identified by injecting a small volume of saline containing 0.25% Fast Green dye (Sigma) into a random proximal segment. Late proximal puncture sites were identified as the last surface segment to fill with green dye before it disappeared into the loop of Henle. In a small population of nephrons (10–20%), an early distal puncture site could be identified when the green dye returned to the kidney surface. During two consecutive clearance periods lasting 30–60 min, at least five timed proximal collections were made, and usually two to three paired distal collections were made. In those nephrons having both proximal and distal collection sites, the distal tubule collection was performed before the proximal collection. Blood samples (5–10 μl) were taken in heparinized tubes before and after each clearance period. Sharpened glass micropipettes used for dye injection were 2–3 μm in diameter, and those used for fluid collection were 6–7 μm. At the end of each experiment, tubular fluid samples were transferred individually to 1-μl constant bore microcaps for determination of volume and inulin concentration as described previously (24Lorenz J.N. Gruenstein E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F172-F177PubMed Google Scholar). The tubular fluid chloride concentration was determined by electrometric titration (25Ramsay J.A. Brown R.H. Croghan P.C. J. Exp. Biol. 1955; 32: 822-829Google Scholar). Blood samples were centrifuged, and aliquots of plasma were transferred into 1-μl microcaps for inulin determination. Urine samples were also evaluated for inulin for the determination of whole kidney glomerular filtration rate. SeparateRomk −/− (n = 3) and wild-type mice (n = 5) of either sex and weighing 20–30 g were prepared and proximal tubule segments identified for micropuncture as described above. Early proximal portions of the identified tubules were blocked with wax, and a micropipette attached to a nanoliter infusion pump was inserted into the last superficial proximal segment for loop of Henle perfusion. Another micropipette, attached to a Servo-null pressure device (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), was then inserted into an early proximal segment recognizable from the widening of the tubular lumen. When stop-flow pressure stabilized, the loop of Henle perfusion rate was altered from 0 to 40 nl/min, and maximal responses in stop-flow pressures were recorded. Perfusion fluid contained (in mm) 136 NaCl, 4 NaHCO3, 4 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 7.5 urea, and 1 mg/ml Fast Green. In a few tubules (see under “Results”), 36 mm NaCl in the perfusion fluid was replaced with 36 mm KCl to test the effect of perfusion with high K+ (100 mm Na+, 40 mm K+). Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance using a single factor design or a mixed factorial design with repeated measures on the second factor. Where necessary, individual comparisons of group means were accomplished using individual contrasts. Data are expressed as means ± S.E., and differences are regarded as significant at p < 0.05. TheRomk gene was disrupted in embryonic stem cells by insertion of the neomycin resistance gene into the large core exon (Fig.1 A). Targeted cells were identified by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1 B) and used to generate a mutant line carrying the null allele. As shown by PCR analysis of tail DNA (Fig. 1 C), breeding of heterozygous mutant mice resulted in the birth of live pups of all three genotypes.Romk +/+, heterozygous, and null mutant mice were born in a normal Mendelian ratio (26.6% +/+, 49.8% +/−, and 23.6% −/− among the first 500 pups), demonstrating that ROMK is not required for survival of the embryo. Northern blot analysis of kidney mRNA from wild-type and Romk −/− mice showed that insertion of the neomycin resistance gene had virtually eliminated expression of Romk mRNA (Fig. 1 D), although trace levels of an mRNA that was larger than the wild-type mRNA was detected with the 3′-probe. Null mutants exhibited growth retardation, and by 1 week of age most of them could be identified because of poor turgor and wrinkled skin, probably reflecting fluid volume depletion. Mortality ofRomk −/− mice was high (Fig.2), with 85% dying by 12 days of age, and only 5% surviving to weaning at 21 days. Daily subcutaneous injections of either indomethacin, which was reported to improve the survival rate of NKCC2-deficient mice (11Takahashi N. Chernavvsky D.R. Gomez R.A. Igarashi P. Gitelman H.J. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5434-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), or isotonic saline, which rescued mice lacking the mineralocorticoid receptor (26Bleich M. Warth R. Schmidt-Hieber M. Schulz-Baldes A. Hasselblatt P. Fisch D. Berger S. Kunzelmann K. Kriz W. Schutz G. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1999; 438: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), did not improve the survival rate of null mutants.Romk −/− mice that survived to weaning exhibited no excess mortality and grew well. Adult mutants were slightly smaller than wild-type mice but appeared healthy. Both male and female null mutants were fertile. Grossly, mutant kidneys from young (7–9 days) and adult mice showed moderate to severe dilation of the renal pelvis, indicative of hydronephrosis (Fig.3, A and B). Histologically, it was readily apparent at the macro level that the renal cortex was considerably thinned, and an enormously dilated renal pelvis surrounded the renal papilla in mutant kidneys, which made it difficult to visualize thin loops in the mutant mice. This was accompanied by a loss of organization and structure within the medulla of the kidney. Unlike in wild-type mice (Fig. 3 C), abundant droplets of lipidic material were seen within the proximal tubule cells of adult Romk −/− mice (Fig. 3 D). This debris, possibly lysosomal, sometimes had a myelin character. Similar structures were found as casts in the tubular lumen (Fig.3 E). These structures may represent the lysis or loss of apical membranes of compromised cells but did not contain calcium crystalline deposits (27Ghadially F.N. Ultrastruct. Pathol. 2001; 25: 243-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the proximal tubule mainly, but also in the distal tubule, mitochondria of adultRomk −/− mice contained significantly more dense, native intramitochondrial granules (Fig. 3 F) than those of wild-type mice, often accompanied by an increase in overall electron density of the cell. The results of morphometric analyses of the renal cortex are presented in Table I. There were no differences in volume density of the glomeruli between wild-type andRomk −/− mice of any age, although in young mutant mice there were often dark bodies within the glomeruli (perhaps apoptotic debris). This difference was not found in adults. Although glomeruli from both young and adult null mutants were usually histologically indistinguishable from those of wild-type mice, on occasion the glomerular tuft was dwarfed by a ballooning of the urinary space. The glomerular basement membrane in mutant mice was examined for thickening and for calcium deposits using electron microscopy, but neither was encountered. Distal and collecting tubules were often dilated in both young and adult Romk −/− mice. The volume density of proximal tubule cells was significantly decreased in the knockout compared with the wild-type, and at the same time the volume density of distal tubules was significantly increased. The ratio of distal to proximal tubules was significantly increased in mutant mice (Table I), indicating that a compensatory increase had occurred in the relative length of the distal tubule in the knockout. A loss of organization of mitochondria within the basal portion of individual proximal tubule cells was found in the mutant mice. With electron microscopy (data not shown), proximal tubule cells from mutant animals showed less organellar order; specifically, there were fewer basal membrane infoldings and mitochondrial interdigitation in knockout mice than in the wild-type mice. This was not true of the distal tubule, however, where the level of subcellular organization appeared to be similar in wild-type and null mice. The amount of lipid debris in the proximal tubule was significantly greater in the knockout.Table IMorphometric analysis of renal cortex in young and adult Romk+/+ and Romk−/− mice+/+ (n = 14)−/− (n = 17)p valueVd glomeruli7.4 ± 1.96.44 ± 1.3NSVd PT64.5 ± 3.5647.7 ± 2.20.0001Vd DT28.0 ± 2.650.3 ± 2.30.0001Distal: proximal tubule ratio0.47 ± 0.071.36 ± 0.170.0001PT mitochondrial organization3.36 ± 0.242.35 ± 0.250.0075DT mitochondrial organization2.24 ± 0.262.2 ± 0.27NSVd lipid debris0.22 ± 0.051.28 ± 0.180.0001Vd, volume density; PT, proximal convoluted tubule; DT, distal convoluted tubule. p value compared with +/+.

Prior to weaning, pups were evaluated for blood and urine chemistries (Table II). Wild-type and heterozygous pups were indistinguishable based on the measured variables. Compared with Romk +/+ mice, most of the null mutants had markedly reduced body weight and failed to thrive. Wet kidney weight did not differ between wild-type and mutant mice, so the kidney weight:body weight ratio was significantly greater in Romk −/− mice. There were no significant differences in blood pCO2 orpO2 or between wild-type and mutant mice; however, pH and HCO 3− were significantly reduced, and hematocrit and plasma Na+ and Cl− concentrations were significantly elevated in the mutants, consistent with metabolic acidosis, volume depletion, and dehydration.Table IIBlood and urine data from 7–9-day-old Romk+/+, Romk+/− and Romk−/− pups+/+ (n = 6)+/− (n = 12)−/− (n = 7)BW (g)5.9 ± 0.65.0 ± 0.33.3 ± 0.6*KW (g)0.08 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.010.08 ± 0.01KW/BW1.26 ± 0.071.34 ± 0.022.36 ± 0.19*Hct (%)37 ± 136 ± 147 ± 2*pCO2 (mm Hg)51.5 ± 2.750.6 ± 1.853.3 ± 3.7pO2 (mm Hg)43.8 ± 5.347.0 ± 5.136.6 ± 3.8pH7.38 ± 0.017.40 ± 0.017.26 ± 0.04*PHCO−3(mm)30.0 ± 1.630.3 ± 1.024.7 ± 1.1*PNa+(mm)131 ± 2132 ± 1170 ± 6*PK+(mm)6.4 ± 0.36.3 ± 0.47.2 ± 0.4PCL−(mm)98 ± 298 ± 1119 ± 5*UNa+(mm)35 ± 826 ± 641 ± 19UK+(mm)55 ± 1938 ± 755 ± 11Uosm (mosm/liter)685 ± 134582 ± 39566 ± 57BW, body weight; KW, kidney weight; Px, plasma concentration of x; Ux, urine concentration of x; Hct, hematocrit; *p < 0.05 compared with +/+.

However, the receptors involved in amastigote-dendritic cell interaction are unknown, especially in absence of opsonizing antibodies. We have studied the interaction of Leishmania pifanoi axenic amastigotes with the C-type lectin DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN, CD209), a receptor for ICAM-2, ICAM-3, human immunodeficiency virus gp120, and Ebola virus.

Our finding has important implications forLeishmania host-cell interaction and the immunoregulation of cutaneous leishmaniasis. dendritic cell monocyte-derived DC DC-SIGN, DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (CD209) 5,6-carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester human immunodeficiency virus phosphate-buffered saline Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne parasitic disease with a broad range of clinical manifestations, from local cutaneous lesions to life-threatening visceral disease, mainly caused by differences amongLeishmania species and the immunological status of the mammalian host. The parasite exists in two developmental stages; the flagellated promastigote is transmitted with the bite of the sand fly (insect vector) to the mammalian host, where it transforms into the amastigote stage. Leishmania amastigote infects mononuclear phagocytes, a key factor of the immune response against the parasite. This intracellular location potentially allows the parasite to subvert the effector and regulatory functions of these cells. Cutaneous antigen-presenting cells, more specifically, epidermal Langerhans cells and dermal dendritic cells (DCs),1 are actively involved in the surveillance of their environment (1Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12349) Google Scholar, 2Mellman I. Steinman R.M. Cell. 2001; 106: 255-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar). Given their proximity to the site of parasite delivery, the role of dendritic cells must be critical in initiating Leishmania-specific immune responses (3Moll H. Fuchs H. Blank C. Rollinghoff M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1595-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For Leishmania amazonensis (Leishmania mexicana complex), both amastigotes and metacyclic promastigotes infect DCs (4Qi H. Popov V. Soong L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4534-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), although the ability of Langerhans cells and DCs to take up other Leishmania species is still a matter of debate (5Konecny P.

To our knowledge, specific receptors for Leishmania on DCs have not yet been characterized. Dendritic cells express a wide variety of pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptors, including numerous C-type lectin and lectin-like receptors (12Figdor C.G. Adema G.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Given the fact thatLeishmania spp. surface displays an abundance of mannose-rich glycoconjugates (13Ilgoutz S.C. McConville M.J. Int. J. Parasitol. 2001; 31: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), a reasonable hypothesis is that lectin-oligosaccharide interactions are involved in parasite recognition. Dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN, CD209) is a cell surface C-type lectin expressed on dendritic cells and involved in cell-cell interactions through its capacity to bind ICAM-3 and ICAM-2 (14Geijtenbeek T.B.

In the present report we have assessed the participation of DC-SIGN on Leishmania pifanoi axenic amastigote binding and uptake by human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs). Our results demonstrate that amastigotes bind specifically and with high avidity to DC-SIGN, suggesting a role for this novel receptor in the outcome of the immune responses againstLeishmania. The DC-SIGN-specific monoclonal antibody (MR-1) has been described previously (18Relloso M. Puig-Kroger A. Pello O.M. Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. de La Rosa G. Longo N. Navarro J. Munoz-Fernandez M.A. Sanchez-Mateos P. Corbi A.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2634-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It was characterized (IgG1) and quantified by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (SBA Clonotyping System; SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, AL). The monoclonal antibody TS1/18 (IgG1, anti-CD18) was used as isotype-matched control. Soluble mannan fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (M-7504; Sigma) was prepared as a 2 mg/ml stock solution in PBS, sterile-filtered, and used at the indicated concentrations. L. pifanoi amastigote glycosylinositolphospholipids were purified by successive extraction of whole parasite with organic solvents as described previously (19Piedrafita D. Proudfoot L. Nikolaev A.V., Xu, D. Sands W. Feng G.J. Thomas E. Brewer J. Ferguson M.A. Alexander J. Liew F.Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), analyzed by TLC, and stored as a 10 mg/ml sterile-filtered stock solution in PBS (1% Me2SO). Recombinant human ICAM-3/Fc chimera was purchased from R&D Systems (Abingdon, United Kingdom). L. pifanoi MHOM/VE/60Ltrod axenic amastigotes were grown at 31 °C in simplified F29 medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (20Pan A.A. Exp. Parasitol. 1984; 58: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For binding experiments, parasites were labeled with the fluorescent dye CFSE (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) before cell adhesion, as described previously (4Qi H. Popov V. Soong L. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 4534-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This process neither alters nor impairs parasite multiplication (21Kamau S.W. Nunez R. Grimm F. BMC Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as determined in control experiments. Immature MDDCs were prepared from peripheral blood monocytes using interleukin 4 (1000 units/ml) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (1000 units/ml) (18Relloso M. Puig-Kroger A. Pello O.M. Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. de La Rosa G. Longo N. Navarro J. Munoz-Fernandez M.A. Sanchez-Mateos P. Corbi A.L. J.

K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 10 μg/ml gentamicin (complete medium). K562 cells transfected with DC-SIGN (K562-CD209 cells) (18Relloso M. Puig-Kroger A. Pello O.M. Rodriguez-Fernandez J.L. de La Rosa G. Longo N. Navarro J. Munoz-Fernandez M.A. Sanchez-Mateos P. Corbi A.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2634-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) were grown in complete medium supplemented with 300 μg/ml G418. Immature MDDCs, K562 cells, or K562-CD209 cells were resuspended in complete medium and aliquoted in 24-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well). CFSE-labeled parasites were added onto the cells at the indicated ratio, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for the period of time indicated in each experiment. Afterward, cells were fixed (1% paraformaldehyde in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem), and analyzed on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope (Nikon, Melville, NY) equipped for epifluorescence. Alternatively, cells with and without attached parasites were resolved by flow cytometry in two peaks of low and high fluorescence intensity, using an EPICS-CS (Coulter Cientı́fica, Madrid, Spain). For inhibition assays, cells were washed with PBS-1 mm EDTA and preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with either MR-1 antibody (1.2 μg/ml, unless otherwise indicated), irrelevant antibodies (100 μg/ml human immunoglobulins or 16 μg/ml anti-CD18 TS1/18 isotype control), EGTA (5 mm), soluble mannan (300 μg/ml), or purified L. pifanoi amastigote glycosylinositolphospholipids (5 μg/ml) in complete medium before parasite addition. DC-SIGN-dependent adhesion of MDDCs was evaluated using ICAM-3/Fc. 96-well microtiter EIA II-Linbro plates were coated overnight with ICAM-3/Fc at 3 μg/ml in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.8, at 4 °C, and the remaining sites were blocked with 0.4% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. MDDCs were labeled in complete medium with the fluorescent dye 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes) and then preincubated for 20 min at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin and function-blocking antibodies against CD209 (MR-1), CD18 (TS1/18), or mannan at 100 μg/ml. Cells were then allowed to adhere to each well for 15 min at 37 °C. Unbound cells were removed by three washes with warm RPMI 1640 medium, and adherent cells were quantified using a fluorescence analyzer. DCs were adjusted to 106 cells/well in 24-well plates and incubated at 37 °C with parasites at different ratios for 1 h. For inhibition assays, cells were washed with PBS-1 mm EDTA and preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with either MR-1, TS1/18, or soluble mannan in complete medium before parasite addition. After removal of unbound parasites by washing, DC-Leishmaniasamples were incubated at 34 °C for 48 h. Afterward, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with methanol, and stained with Giemsa to visualize amastigote-infected DCs. The percentage of infected DCs and the parasite:DC ratio were determined by light microscopy examination of at least 200 cells. Preliminary experiments revealed that L. pifanoi axenic amastigotes were efficiently internalized by human MDDCs (see below). In order to explore whether DC-SIGN was involved in amastigote binding, we first analyzed the interaction of axenic amastigotes with K562 cells transfected with DC-SIGN (K562-CD209 cells). L. pifanoi axenic amastigotes bound to transfected cells, but not to untransfected cells, in a dose-dependent manner, as evaluated by flow cytometry using CFSE-labeled parasites (Fig. 1). Maximal binding was observed within the 1:10 to 1:5 range by using distinct K562-CD209:amastigote ratios (1:1, 1:5, and 1:10). Accordingly, and to avoid an excess of parasites, a ratio of 1:5 was used for the rest of kinetic and competition assays. The binding of amastigotes to K562-CD209 was fast and reached saturation at 1 h (Fig.2). Importantly, the anti-DC-SIGN MR-1 monoclonal antibody completely blocked amastigote binding to K562-CD209 cells (Fig. 2), confirming the involvement of DC-SIGN in this interaction. Soluble mannan (300 μg/ml) only caused a 30% reduction in amastigote binding (Fig. 2), whereas Leishmaniaglycosylinositolphospholipids, high mannose-containing molecules abundantly present on promastigote and amastigote plasma membranes (23McConville M.J.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2471-2482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not inhibit amastigote binding at 5 μg/ml (roughly equivalent to 2 × 107 amastigotes/ml) (25Zawadzki J. Scholz C. Currie G. Coombs G.H. McConville M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Therefore, DC-SIGN functions as a receptor for L. pifanoiamastigotes, whose cell attachment can be partially competed by mannan.Figure 2L. pifanoi amastigotes bind specifically to DC-SIGN on K562-CD209 cells. K562-CD209 cells were either left untreated (control) or pretreated with MR-1 (1.2 μg/ml), soluble mannan (300 μg/ml), or Leishmania purified glycosylinositolphospholipids (5 μg/ml) and then incubated at 37 °C with CFSE-labeled amastigotes at a 1:5 cell:parasite ratio for the indicated period of time. The proportion of cells with bound amastigotes was quantified by flow cytometry after gating on K562 cells and determining the percentage of high fluorescence cells. Two arbitrary regions were established: K562 with unbound parasites and fluorescent K562 due to CFSE-labeled bound amastigotes. For comparative purposes, scales were normalized relative to the number of cells without bound parasites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The role of DC-SIGN in amastigote uptake by dendritic cells was initially assessed by preincubation of human immature MDDCs with an excess of anti-DC-SIGN antibody or soluble mannan before the addition of CFSE-labeled axenic amastigotes (1:5 ratio, 2 h, 37 °C). Pretreatment of MDDCs with MR-1 antibody reduced parasite binding in a dose-dependent manner at more than 30 ng/ml (Fig.3). The dose-dependent inhibitory effect of the MR-1 antibody demonstrates the specificity of the DC-SIGN-Leishmania amastigote interaction. As expected, binding was completely inhibited by EGTA, an inhibitor of C-type lectin-mediated interactions, but not by human immunoglobulins or the isotype control anti-CD18 TS1/18 antibody (Fig. 3). On the other hand, pretreatment with mannan weakly affected amastigote binding to MDDCs. Essentially the same results were obtained after microscopic examination. As shown in Fig.4 A, the number of amastigotes bound per DC was reduced in the presence of 1.2 μg/ml anti-DC-SIGN MR-1 antibody (17.7 ± 4.9 versus 7.25 ± 2.0 amastigotes/DC), whereas no effect was observed with the isotype-matched TS1/18 antibody at 16 μg/ml. These results further confirmed that DC-SIGN contributes to amastigote binding onto the DC surface. In agreement with the flow cytometry data (Fig. 3), mannan had no significant effect on the number of amastigotes bound per DC (Fig.4 A), despite the fact that it effectively abrogated the DC-SIGN-dependent MDDC binding to immobilized ICAM-3 (Fig.4 B). To test whether DC-SIGN-L. pifanoi amastigote interaction had a physiological significance in MDDC infection, immature cells were left untreated (control) or preincubated with MR-1 antibody or mannan (500 μg/ml) and then incubated with axenic amastigotes at a 1:5 DC:parasite ratio. After 48 h, infection was evaluated by examination of at least 200 Giemsa-stained cells. L. pifanoiaxenic amastigotes were efficiently internalized by human immature MDDCs in the absence of opsonizing antibodies (82.5% of DCs infected), whereas pretreatment of MDDCs with MR-1 antibody significantly reduced the number of infected cells (82.5% versus 7.4%) (TableI). As observed in binding experiments, incubation with anti-CD18 did not reduce the percentage of infected cells (91.0%). Again, mannan partially inhibited Leishmaniainternalization into MDDCs. Taken together, these results demonstrate that, in the absence of Fc receptor-mediated interactions, DC-SIGN is a functionally relevant receptor for binding and internalization ofL. pifanoi amastigotes on dendritic cells.Table IMR-1 antibody inhibits MDDC infection by L. pifanoi axenic amastigotesDC:parasite ratio% infected DCNo. of parasites/infected DCControl82.52.3MR-17.42.4TS1/18911.1Mannan342.3Immature human MDDCs were left untreated (control), preincubated with a monoclonal antibody specific for DC-SIGN (MR-1), an irrelevant antibody (TS1/18), or mannan, and then infected with L. pifanoiaxenic amastigotes.

The percentage of infected DCs and the number of internalized amastigotes per infected cell were determined by light microscopy examination of Giemsa-stained preparations. Early events occurring at the site of delivery ofLeishmania include infection of host cells by metacyclic promastigotes followed by their intracellular transformation into amastigote. Once released into the extracellular milieu, amastigotes invade new cells and thereby disseminate the infection. In the first rounds of this expansive cycle, specific antibodies are absent, precluding opsonizing mechanisms from contributing to parasite uptake. Infection of murine and human DCs by amastigotes is clearly documented in the literature (7Ridley M.J. Wells C.W. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 123: 79-85PubMed Google Scholar, 8Isaza D.M. Restrepo M.

Parasitol. 1988; 74: 186-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although the receptors involved remain unknown. According to the available literature, opsonization by specific antibodies may play a major role in targeting and entry of the parasite into the host cells (26Kane M.M. Mosser D.M. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2000; 7: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because most of theLeishmania amastigote-dendritic cell studies were carried out with tissue-derived parasites, known to be opsonized by antibodies, the participation of opsonization-independent mechanisms might have been masked. In the present study we have used axenic amastigotes, devoid of opsonizing antibodies, in order to analyze the participation of the receptor DC-SIGN in binding and internalization ofLeishmania amastigotes. Our results demonstrate that axenic amastigotes specifically bind to DC-SIGN both on K562-CD209 cells and MDDCs. Because MR-1 antibody dramatically reduced amastigote binding to and internalization into DCs, our results suggest an important role for this receptor in the early infection of DCs byLeishmania. Unlike MDDC binding to ICAM-3, mannan did not completely block amastigote binding to dendritic cells, in agreement with previous data on the failure of mannan to inhibit Leishmaniaamastigote-macrophage interactions (27Guy R.A. Belosevic M. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several alternative explanations might account for the incomplete inhibitory effect of mannan on the DC-SIGN-Leishmania interaction. First,Leishmania binding sites on DC-SIGN might differ from those involved in mannan binding. In this regard, site-directed mutagenesis has shown that ICAM-3- and HIV gp120-binding sites are not completely identical and that HIV gp120 recognition by DC-SIGN is not dependent on glycosylation (28Geijtenbeek T.B. van Duijnhoven G.C. van Vliet S.J. Krieger E. Vriend G. Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11314-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Second, the overall affinity of theLeishmania ligand(s) for DC-SIGN might exceed that of mannan. This alternative is supported by the fact that subtle changes in the oligosaccharide structure of related mannose-rich molecules lead to substantial differences in their affinity for DC-SIGN (29Mitchell D.A. Fadden A.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28939-28945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because the parasite could behave as a multivalent ligand, the possibility of cooperative effects on the interaction betweenLeishmania and DC-SIGN-expressing cells cannot be ruled out. To our knowledge, this is the first description of DC-SIGN as a receptor for nonviral pathogen. Moreover, because pathogens are known to alter dendritic cell effector functions (30Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6247) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that DC-SIGN-Leishmania interactions might condition the initiation of the pathological immune response caused byL. mexicana complex parasites. Further studies on the DC-SIGN-Leishmania interaction will undoubtedly increase our understanding of the Leishmania infection process and will pave the way for alternative strategies to fight the disease.

In this study, we examined the role of lipid rafts and raft-associated glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins in the process by which Helicobacter pylorivacuolating toxin (VacA) intoxicates cells. We first investigated whether GPI-anchored proteins are required for VacA toxicity by analyzing wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and CHO-LA1 mutant cells that are defective in production of GPI-anchored proteins. Whereas wild-type and mutant cells differed markedly in susceptibility to aerolysin (a bacterial toxin that binds to GPI-anchored proteins), they were equally susceptible to VacA. We next determined whether VacA physically associates with lipid rafts. CHO or HeLa cells were incubated with VacA, and Triton-insoluble membranes then were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Immunoblot analysis revealed that a substantial proportion of cell-associated toxin was associated with detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). DRM association required acid activation of the purified toxin prior to contact with cells, and acid activation also was required for VacA cytotoxicity. Treatment of cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (a cholesterol-depleting agent) did not inhibit VacA-induced depolarization of the plasma membrane, but interfered with the internalization or intracellular localization of VacA and inhibited the capacity of the toxin to induce cell vacuolation. Treatment of cells with nystatin also inhibited VacA-induced cell vacuolation. These data indicate that VacA associates with lipid raft microdomains in the absence of GPI-anchored proteins and suggest that association of the toxin with lipid rafts is important for VacA cytotoxicity.

Infection with these organisms consistently results in gastric inflammation and is a risk factor for the development of peptic ulcer disease, distal gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric lymphoma (1Cover T.L.

In a mouse model, a VacA-producing strain exhibited an enhanced capacity to colonize the stomach compared with an isogenic vacA-mutant strain, particularly in co-infection experiments (6Salama N.R.

Studies in mouse and gerbil models also have suggested that VacA contributes to gastric mucosal injury (7Telford J.L. Ghiara P. Dell'Orco M. Comanducci M. Burroni D. Bugnoli M. Tecce M.F. Censini S.

The vacA gene encodes a 140-kDa protoxin, which undergoes cleavage of an amino-terminal signal sequence and cleavage of a carboxyl-terminal peptide to yield an 88 kDa secreted toxin (3–5,15). Secretion of VacA occurs via an autotransporter mechanism (16Fischer W. Buhrdorf R. Gerland E. Haas R. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 6769-6775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When isolated in a purified form from broth culture supernatant, VacA is in an oligomeric state consisting predominantly of dodecameric or tetradecameric flower-shaped structures (17Adrian M.

Thus, it is presumed that VacA toxicity requires binding of monomeric forms of the toxin to the plasma membrane. Following binding of VacA to the surface of eukaryotic cells, the toxin can insert into the plasma membrane to form anion-selective channels (23Czajkowsky D.M. Iwamoto H. Cover T.L. Shao Z. Proc.

HEp-2 cells expressing dominant negative mutants of two proteins required for clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Eps 15 and dynamin II) develop cellular vacuoles in response to VacA (31Ricci V.

It has been proposed that VacA toxicity requires localization of the toxin in either endosomes or mitochondria (28Ricci V. Sommi P. Fiocca R. Romano M. Solcia E. Ventura U. J.

Alternatively, it is possible that VacA might have novel intracellular activities distinct from membrane channel formation (5Papini E. Zoratti M. Cover T.L.

In summary, there continues to be considerable uncertainty about the site of VacA action and the molecular mechanisms underlying its toxic activity. In recent years, it has been recognized that a variety of pathogens and toxins interact with microdomains in the plasma membrane known as lipid rafts (35Fivaz M. Abrami L. van der Goot F.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 212-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts are membrane microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)1-anchored proteins (36Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V.

In addition, certain bacterial toxins, including aerolysin, perfringolysin O, cholera toxin, and tetanus toxin, utilize rafts as either a site for high affinity binding and oligomerization on the surface of cells or as a site for internalization into host cells (42Zitzer A.

A recent study reported that treatment of HEp-2 cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), an agent that removes GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface, inhibited the capacity of VacA to induce cell vacuolation (31Ricci V. Galmiche A. Doye A. Necchi V. Solcia E. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3897-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It also was reported that incubation of the cells with nystatin (a cholesterol-binding agent) inhibited VacA-induced cell vacuolation (31Ricci V. Galmiche A. Doye A. Necchi V. Solcia E. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3897-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it was proposed that the presence of one or more GPI-anchored proteins and intact membrane lipid rafts are required for VacA cytotoxicity. Specifically, it was hypothesized that VacA monomers might bind to GPI-anchored proteins and that lipid rafts might act as concentrating platforms enabling VacA to concentrate locally and oligomerize efficiently (31Ricci V. Galmiche A. Doye A. Necchi V. Solcia E. Boquet P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3897-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, there has not yet been any direct evidence indicating that VacA physically interacts with either GPI-anchored proteins or lipid rafts. In the current study, we provide biochemical evidence indicating that VacA associates with lipid raft microdomains and report that the presence of GPI-anchored proteins is not required for either association of the toxin with rafts or VacA-induced cell vacuolation. In addition, we present data suggesting that VacA interaction with lipid rafts is an important feature of the process by which VacA intoxicates cells. VacA was purified in an oligomeric form from culture supernatant of H. pylori strain 60190, as described previously (18Cover T.L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. J.

In most experiments, purified VacA was acid-activated by the slow addition of 200 mm HCl to the toxin preparation until a pH of 3 was reached (20McClain M.S. Schraw W. Ricci V. Boquet P. Cover T.L.

Proaerolysin was purified from culture supernatant of Aeromonas salmonicida as described previously (47Buckley J.T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and CHO cells were grown in Ham’s F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Mutant CHO-LA1 cells (defective in production of GPI-anchored proteins) and mutant cells recomplemented with the PIG-L gene (i.e. with restored capacity for production of GPI-anchored proteins, hereafter designated as wild-type CHO cells) have been described previously (48Abrami L.

In assays to test VacA-induced vacuolation of cells, the tissue culture medium was supplemented with 5 mm ammonium chloride (49Cover T.L. Vaughn S.G. Cao P. Blaser M.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 50Cover T.L. Puryear W. Peárez-Peárez G.I. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and VacA was acid-activated as described above. Acid-activated VacA then was diluted in neutral pH tissue culture medium and was added directly to the neutral pH medium overlying cells. Purified VacA (∼1.2 mg) from H. pylori 60190 (in 25 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm sodium chloride) was incubated with 1 ml of a 1:1 mixture of Affi-Gel 10:Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for 4 h, followed by addition of 200 μl of 0.5 m ethanolamine. This preparation then was loaded onto a 2-ml Poly-prep column (Bio-Rad), and the column was sequentially washed with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm sodium chloride and 0.02% sodium azide, with 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) containing 500 mm sodium chloride, with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5), with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.8), with 100 mm ammonium hydroxide (pH 11.5), and finally with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm sodium chloride and 0.02% sodium azide. Anti-VacA rabbit serum 958 (about 1 ml), prepared by immunizing with purified oligomeric VacA from H. pyloristrain 60190, was passed over CM Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad) to remove albumin, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The immunoglobulin fraction was concentrated by precipitation with ammonium sulfate and resuspended in 10 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm sodium chloride and 0.02% sodium azide. The de-albuminated serum was then applied three times to the VacA affinity column described above. The column was washed two times with 5 column volumes of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm sodium chloride and 0.02% sodium azide and then washed two times with 5 column volumes of 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) containing 500 mm sodium chloride. Bound immunoglobulin was eluted with ten 0.5-ml aliquots of 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5) and collected into 100 μl of 1m Tris (pH 8.0) containing 2.5 mg/ml ovalbumin. Aliquots were tested for anti-VacA immunoreactivity by immunoblotting, and the reactive aliquots were pooled. EDTA (10 mm) and sodium azide (0.02%) were added to the reactive aliquots to facilitate storage. Residual nonspecific reactivity in the serum was removed by adsorbing the affinity-purified serum against an Affi-Gel column (prepared as described above) containing both H. pyloriproteins (from a vacA null mutant strain) and HeLa cell proteins. The purified serum was concentrated to a volume of 2 ml in a Centricon-30 device, diluted 1:2 with glycerol, and stored at either 4 °C or −20 °C. HeLa or CHO cells were grown to confluence in 75-mm plastic dishes, using Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum or Ham’s F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. Cells were washed three times with 0.9% NaCl to remove serum, and serum-free Eagle’s containing 1 mg/ml ovalbumin then was added to cells. Approximately 1–2 × 107 cells then were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with 10 μg/ml H. pylori VacA. Triton-insoluble cell components were then isolated according to previously published protocols (51Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5619-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed twice with 0.9% NaCl and once with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) (TBS) to remove unbound toxin and then were lysed at 4 °C in 2 ml of TBS (pH 7.4) containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a eukaryotic cell protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysate was Dounce-homogenized (10 strokes) and incubated for 30 min on ice. An equal volume of 80% w/v sucrose in TBS was added to 2 ml of lysate. This was overlayered on a 0.35 ml of 80% sucrose cushion. The 40% sucrose-containing lysate was successively overlayered with 4 ml of 30% (w/v) sucrose in TBS and 4.2 ml of 5% (w/v) sucrose in TBS. Samples were centrifuged for 21 h at 208,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 41 TI rotor. Afterward, 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient (fraction 1) to the bottom (fraction 12). Pelleted material recovered from the bottom of the tube was resuspended in fraction 12. Fractions were stored frozen at −20 °C prior to further analysis. Equal volumes of sucrose density gradient fractions (45 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Gradient fractions 1 and 2, 9 and 10, and 11 and 12 were routinely pooled (as lanes a,h, and i, respectively, in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) to permit immunoblot analysis of all gradient fractions on a single polyacrylamide gel. The transferrin receptor was detected in gradient fractions by using a mouse anti-human transferrin receptor antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). VacA was detected by using the affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-VacA antibody preparation described above. CD55 was detected using rabbit anti-human CD55 affinity-purified antibody (Research Diagnostics Inc.). Immunoblot analyses were performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected by mixing equal volumes of gradient fractions with a solution of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (2 mg/ml) in 0.1 m Tris-Cl (pH 9.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the optical density of samples was analyzed at 410 nm. Triplicate reactions were performed for each gradient fraction.Figure 4.

Acid-activated VacA was incubated with wild-type CHO cells and with CHO-LA1 cells (defective in production of GPI-anchored proteins) for 1.5 h at 25 °C. After lysing the cells, Triton-insoluble fractions were analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation and immunoblotting of fractions with anti-VacA serum.

Acid activation of VacA enhances its localization in lipid rafts.A, purified VacA was either acid-activated or left untreated and then incubated with HeLa cells at 4 °C for 1 h. Analysis of total cell lysates by immunoblotting with anti-VacA serum indicated that both forms of the toxin bound to cells and that the total binding of acid-activated VacA to cells was greater than that of non-activated VacA. B andC, HeLa cells were incubated with either acid-activated VacA (1 μg/ml) or non-activated VacA (1 μg/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were fixed and permeabilized, and the localization of VacA then was detected by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, using affinity-purified rabbit anti-VacA serum. Acid-activated VacA was localized in a focal punctate pattern within the cells (B), whereas this pattern of localization was not detected in cells treated with non-activated VacA (C). D and E, Triton-insoluble cell components were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and gradient fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-VacA serum.

Staphylococcus aureus is an important bacterial pathogen that causes a great variety of human diseases. The pathogenicity of S. aureus largely depends on a set of virulence factors. These include cell wall-associated proteins involved in attaching the bacteria to host cells or extracellular matrices and protecting the bacteria against host defenses. Other factors are secreted proteins that attack host cells, degrade components of extracellular matrices, and interfere with immune responses (1Projan S.J. Novick R.P. Crossley K.B. Archer G.L. The Staphylococci in Human Disease. Churchill Livingstone, New York1997: 55-81Google Scholar). The expression of these virulence factor genes is primarily regulated by a quorum sensing system encoded by the global regulatory locus, the accessory gene regulator (agr). At low cell density, theagr genes are continuously expressed at basal levels. A signal molecule, autoinducing peptide (AIP), 1The abbreviations used are: AIP, autoinducing peptide; agr , accessory gene regulator; BlaZ, β-lactamase; PblaZ, blaZ promoter; PhoA, alkaline phosphatase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; DAS, Dense Alignment Surface. produced and secreted by the bacteria, accumulates outside of the cells (2Ji G.

The P2 transcript, RNA II, encodes four genes, agrA, B,C, and D (6, 7). AgrC, a transmembrane protein, is a sensor kinase of the classic bacterial two component signal transduction system: the N-terminal half is the input domain that interacts with a signal molecule produced by the bacteria, and the C-terminal half is a transmitter that is autophosphorylated at a conserved histidine upon stimulation by the signal molecule (2Ji G.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), supplemented with antibiotics (chloramphenicol, 5 μg/ml, erythromycin, 5 μg/ml) when necessary. Bacteria grown overnight at 37 °C on GL plates (26Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) were routinely used to inoculate liquid cultures. Growth of cells was monitored with either a Klett-Summerson colorimeter with a green (540 nm) filter (Klett, Long Island City, NY) or a VERSAmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at OD650 nm. Expression of genes driven by staphylococcal β-lactamase promoter (PblaZ) was induced with 0.5 μg/ml methicillin. Escherichia coli strain MC1061 (27Sambrook J. Russell D.W.

A ClaI DNA fragment from pGJ2001 containing agrB gene under the control of the staphylococcal PblaZ was inserted into theClaI site of pRN6441 to give rise to pLZ2003. To construct the C-terminal His6-tagged AgrB (AgrB-6xHis) expression plasmid pLZ2004, a PCR product with oligonucleotides GJ#14: 5′-GCTCTAGATCGTATAATGACAG-3′ (XbaI underlined) and GJ#27 5′-CTAATGATGATGATGATGATGTTTTAAGTCCTCCTTAATAAAG-3′ (6 histidine codons and a stop codon underlined) as primers, and pGJ2001 as the template was generated. The PCR product was digested with XbaI and cloned into the XbaI andEcoRI (blunted with Klenow) sites of pRN5548. pGJ4002 was constructed by cloning a ClaI DNA fragment containing theagrD gene under the control of the PblaZ promoter from pRN6913 (2Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12055-12059Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) into pRN6441. pGJ4004 was constructed as follows: a PCR product using oligonucleotides GJ#12 5′-ATGAATTC TGAATACATTATTTAACTTATTTTTTG-3′ (5′ofagrD, italic, with an added EcoRI site, underlined) and GJ#13 5′-ATGTAATATGATTAAGGACGC-3′ (withinagrC gene) as primers and pRN6911 (2Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12055-12059Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) as the template was prepared, cut with EcoRI, and inserted into theEcoRI and HindIII (blunted with Klenow) sites of pRSET-A (Invitrogen), resulting plasmid pRSET-A-agrD. A second PCR product containing ΔagrB and the first three codons of agrD was generated with oligonucleotides GJ#14 5′-GCTCTAGATCGTATAATGACAG-3′ (before the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of agrB, XbaI site, underlined), and GJ#15 5′-GTATTCATTTTAAGTCCTCC-3′ (5′ agrD, italic) as primers, and pRN6911 as the template. This PCR product was then digested with XbaI and ligated into the XbaI and NdeI (blunted with Klenow) sites of pRSET-A-agrD, resulting in the plasmid pRSET-A-T7-6xhis-agrD. Finally, the PCR product with oligonucleotides GJ#14 and GJ#13 as primers and pRSET-A-T7-6xhis-agrD as the template was prepared, digested with XbaI, and cloned into theXbaI and EcoRI (blunted with Klenow) sites of pRN5548. The resulting plasmid, pGJ4004, contains the coding sequence for a bacterial phage T7 epitope and 6 histidine residues inserted at the N terminus of AgrD. Both the N-terminal and the C-terminal His6-tagged AgrD (AgrD-HDH) coding sequence was amplified by PCR with the forward primer GJ#56 5′-GCTCTAGAAGCTATTACATTATTACC-3′ (before the AgrD S.D. sequence, XbaI underlined) and the reverse primer GJ#28 5′-CTAATGATGATGATGATGATGTTCGTGTAATTGTGTAATTC-3′ (3′ ofagrD, italic; 6 histidine codons and one stop codon, underlined), and pGJ4004 as the template. This PCR product was digested with XbaI and cloned into pRN5548 XbaI andEcoRI (blunted with Klenow) sites to produce plasmid pLZ4005. The sequences of all PCR products used above were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transformation of plasmid DNA were done by either the protoplast method (26Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) or electroporation (28Schenk S. Laddaga R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 73: 133-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AIP activity was assayed according to the method described previously (2Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12055-12059Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) except that S. aureus cells expressing AgrD and AgrB or His6-tagged AgrD and AgrB under the control of the staphylococcal PblaZ promoter were induced with methicillin (0.5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 5 h. PCR products using the forward primer GJ#71 5′-GAAGATCT TTGAATTATTTTGATAATAAAATT-3′ (5′agrB in italic, BglII site underlined) and the reverse primers (with an added BamHI site) withinagrB gene, and pGJ2001 plasmid DNA as the template were prepared, digested with BglII and BamHI, and ligated into the BglII site of the E. coli phoA fusion vector pAWLP-2 or pAWLP-3 (kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Wright, Tuft's University School of Medicine). The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli MC1061. The junction between agrB and phoA and theagrB region of each construct was verified by DNA sequencing. PhoA (alkaline phosphatase) activity was measured using overnight cell cultures in LB broth. The colorimetric reaction product was measured using Sigma 104 phosphatase substrate (Sigma) as described previously (29Hoffman C.S. Wright A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5107-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). S. aureus cells were grown in CYGP broth and induced with 0.5 μg/ml methicillin at 37 °C for 3 h. After harvesting, the cell pellet was suspended in 1× sucrose-sodium maleate-MgCl2 (26Novick R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) containing 10 μg/ml lysostaphin and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The protoplasts were then collected and lysed by addition of 1× phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cell lysate was briefly sonicated, and the unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 7,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate was then centrifuged at 200,000 × gfor 2 h at 4 °C to separate the cell membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. The membrane pellet was washed three times with ice-cold water, resuspended in water, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentration was measured with a detergent-compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). E. coli MC1061 cells containing thephoA expression vector or agrB-phoAfusion plasmid were grown in LB broth overnight at 37 °C with shaking. After centrifugation, cell pellets were lysed by brief sonication in buffer consisting of 1% Triton X-100, 25% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, and 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of the whole cell lysate was prepared by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The pellets were dissolved in 1 × SDS sample buffer (27Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), boiled for 5 min, and stored at −20 °C. His6-tagged proteins were purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose under denaturing conditions (in the presence of 8 m urea) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). 1× SDS sample buffer was directly added to the His6-tagged protein bound beads to elute the purified protein. Whole cell lysate, membrane, cytoplasmic fraction, or purified His6-tagged protein samples were boiled for 5 min in 1× SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated either by Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE (27Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) (for AgrB-6xHis and AgrB-PhoA fusion proteins) or by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (30Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10483) Google Scholar) (for AgrD-HDH protein). The separated proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to PROTRAN nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking overnight at 4 °C with TBS buffer (27Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) plus Tween 20 (0.05%) containing 5% nonfat milk, the membranes were incubated in the blocking buffer with the primary antibody (1:500 dilution of mouse anti-pentaHis monoclonal antibody, Qiagen; 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-E. coli PhoA antibody, kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Wright, Tufts University School of Medicine; 1:5000 dilution of anti-T7-tag monoclonal antibody, Novagen) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed extensively and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoblots were detected with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent detection kit (Pierce) followed by exposure to X-Omat film (Kodak). To directly detect and purify the AgrB protein from S. aureus, we made a construct (pLZ2004) in which 6 histidine codons were added to the 3′-end of RN6390B agrB gene. This plasmid, or the cloning vector pRN5548, was transformed into anagr-null S. aureus strain GJ2035, creating strains LZ2004 and LZ0001, respectively. Western blot hybridization analysis with an anti-pentaHis monoclonal antibody as a probe revealed a band with an estimated size of about 23 kDa from whole cell lysate of LZ2004 expressing the His6-tagged AgrB (data not shown). This band was not observed from LZ2001 cell lysate (data not shown). The size of the protein detected was consistent with that of the predicted molecular weight of the His6-tagged AgrB. This result suggests that the AgrB-6xHis protein was expressed in S. aureus. The effect of the 6 histidine residues on the AgrB processing of AgrD was determined as follows. Conditioned media were prepared from cells expressing only wild-type AgrD (LZ4200) or both wild-type AgrB and wild-type AgrD (LZ4201). In parallel, conditioned media were prepared from cells expressing the His6-tagged AgrB and wild-type AgrD (LZ4202). The AIP activities in the conditioned media were measured. LZ4202 produced comparable AIP activity with that of strain LZ4201 (data not shown), indicating that the C-terminal His6-tagged AgrB functioned normally in S. aureus. To determine the cellular localization of the AgrB protein in S. aureus, cytoplasmic and membrane fractions were prepared by ultracentrifugation from LZ0001 or LZ2004 strains. Western blot hybridization with anti-pentaHis monoclonal antibody as a probe showed that the 23-kDa band as detected in the whole cell lysate of LZ2004 appeared in the membrane fraction of the same strain (data not shown). To confirm this result, affinity chromatography with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was employed to partially purify proteins under denaturing conditions from the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions of LZ0001 or LZ2004 cells. This method provides about five times more concentrated proteins. Again, Western blot hybridization analysis showed the 23-kDa protein presented only in the membrane fraction from cells expressing the His6-tagged AgrB (data not shown). These results, consistent with a previous report on the S. epidermidis AgrB (25Saenz H.L. Augsburger V. Vuong C. Jack R.W. Gotz F. Otto M. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 174: 452-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), confirmed that AgrB is located in the cytoplasmic membrane. To facilitate our experimental design in constructing AgrB-PhoA fusions, hydropathy profiles of AgrB proteins from the four groups of S. aureus(3Ji G. Beavis R. Novick R.P.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Staphylococcus lugdunensis (31Vandenesch F. Projan S.J. Kreiswirth B. Etienne J. Novick R.P. FEMS Microbiol.

Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17225) Google Scholar) hydrophobicity plot for these AgrB proteins is shown below in Fig. 2 A. The AgrB proteins were also analyzed with various programs available through the Internet. These programs include TopPred 2 (33von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) (bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/toppred.html), TMHMM (34Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9177) Google Scholar) (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/), and Dense Alignment Surface method (DAS) (35Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 673-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (www.sbc.su.se/∼miklos/DAS/). Despite the highly variable sequences among the AgrBs, all programs gave similar results in hydrophobicity plots, although the predicted transmembrane α-helices were slightly different for some AgrBs. A total of five possible transmembrane segments were predicted from these analyses. To confirm the topology predicted from the hydrophobicity analyses, various lengths of the 5′ region or the full-length of theagrB gene from RN6390B were prepared by PCR and then inserted into the E. coli phoA fusion plasmid pAWLP-2 or pAWLP-3 creating a series of agrB-phoAfusion plasmids. A total of 23 such fusion plasmids were generated. The expression of the fusion proteins in E. coliMC1061 carrying the agrB-phoA fusion plasmid was evaluated by Western blot hybridization of whole cell lysates with a rabbit anti-E. coli PhoA polyclonal antibody. Proteins corresponding to the molecular weight of all the fusion proteins were identifiable, however, high numbers of nonspecific bands also appeared due to the cross-reaction of the polyclonal antibody with other proteins (data not shown). To eliminate the background problem, Triton X-100-insoluble fractions prepared from whole cell lysates were used for Western blot analysis. This non-ionic detergent could dissolve most of the membrane proteins but not all of them, especially when the proteins are highly expressed as in these experiments in which the fusion proteins are expressed under the control of a constitutive"

Recently we and others have found that γ-synuclein is dramatically up-regulated in the vast majority of late-stage breast and ovarian cancers and that γ-synuclein over-expression can enhance tumorigenicity. In the current study, we have found that γ-synuclein is associated with two major mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs),i.e. extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK1/2) and c-JunN-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), and have shown that over-expression of γ-synuclein leads to constitutive activation of ERK1/2 and down-regulation of JNK1 in response to a host of environmental stress signals, including UV, arsenate, and heat shock. We also tested the effects of γ-synuclein on apoptosis and activation of JNK and ERK in response to several chemotherapy drugs. We have found that γ-synuclein-expressing cells are significantly more resistant to the chemotherapeutic drugs paclitaxel and vinblastine as compared with the parental cells. The resistance to paclitaxel can be partially obliterated when ERK activity is inhibited using a MEK1/2 inhibitor. Activation of JNK and its downstream caspase-3 by paclitaxel or vinblastine is significantly down-regulated in γ-synuclein-expressing cells, indicating that the paclitaxel- or vinblastine-activated apoptosis pathway is blocked by γ-synuclein. In contrast to paclitaxel and vinblastine, etoposide does not activate JNK, and γ-synuclein over-expression has no apparent effect on this drug-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our data indicate that oncogenic activation of γ-synuclein contributes to the development of breast and ovarian cancer by promoting tumor cell survival under adverse conditions and by providing resistance to certain chemotherapeutic drugs.

Breast carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women of the Western world. In the United States alone over 180,000 new cases are diagnosed annually and more than 40,000 women die from this disease each year (1Landis S.H. Murray T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA Cancer J. Clin. 1999; 49: 8-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (3135) Google Scholar). Epithelial ovarian cancer continues to be the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies in the United States (1Landis S.H. Murray T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA Cancer J. Clin. 1999; 49: 8-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (3135) Google Scholar, 2Greenlee R.T. Murray T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA Cancer J. Clin. 2000; 50: 7-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (3980) Google Scholar). One woman in 70 in the U.S. will develop ovarian cancer in her lifetime, and one woman in 100 will die of this disease. Breast and ovarian cancer etiology are multifactorial, involving environmental factors, hormones, genetic susceptibility, and genetic changes during progression. Both cancers are a heterogeneous group of tumors with no unifying molecular alteration yet identified. A certain number of breast and ovarian cancer cases (∼5–10%) are attributed to inherited mutations in highly penetrant breast cancer susceptibility genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2(reviewed in Ref. 3Bove B. Dunbrack R. Godwin A.K. Pasqualini J. Breast Cancer: Prognosis, Treatment and Prevention. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York2002Google Scholar). However, the majority of the tumors occur in women with little or no family history, and the molecular basis of these sporadic cancers is still poorly defined. In an effort to identify other genes involved in the development and/or progression of breast and ovarian cancer, we and others used differential gene expression approaches and have found that γ-synuclein, initially termed breast cancer-specific gene 1 (BCSG1), 1The abbreviations used are: BCSG1, breast cancer-specific gene 1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase; JNK, c-JUN N-terminal kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase; LBs, Lewy bodies; AD, Alzheimer's disease; pNA, p-nitroaniline; PD, Parkinson's disease; PKC, protein kinase C; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase. is up-regulated in the majority of late-stage breast (4Bruening W.

In addition, we showed that there was a correlation between γ-synuclein expression in breast ductal carcinomas and the staging of the cancer suggesting that γ-synuclein may be a potential marker for both late stage breast and ovarian cancer. Additional studies have revealed that γ-synuclein over-expression leads to increased invasiveness of breast tumor cells (6Jia T. Liu Y.E. Liu J. Shi Y.E. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 742-747PubMed Google Scholar) and stimulated cell proliferation (7Liu J. Spence M.J. Zhang Y.L. Jiang Y. Liu Y.E. Shi Y.E. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2000; 62: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Synucleins are a family of small, highly soluble proteins that are predominantly expressed in neurons. The functions of the synucleins are not entirely understood. There are four known members: α-synuclein (also referred to as synelfin or non-Aβcomponent of Alzheimer's disease (AD) amyloid precursorprotein) and β-synuclein (also referred to as phosphoneuroprotein 14) are neuronal proteins primarily expressed in brain and are predominantly found at axonal terminals. γ-Synuclein (also known as persyn) is predominantly expressed in certain regions of the peripheral nervous system such as dorsal root ganglia and trigeminal ganglia. Synoretin, the newest member of the synuclein family, is expressed at high levels in the retina and at lower levels in the brain (8Lavedan C. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 9Surguchov A. Surgucheva I. Solessio E. Baehr W. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 13: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The synuclein proteins contain several repeated domains that display variations of a KTKEGV consensus sequence. The β-synuclein protein contains five of these domains, whereas the α- and γ-synucleins have six. Interestingly, the third domain of each protein is completely conserved, and this same type of domain is present in proteins of the Rho family (10Maroteaux L. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2804-2815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another type of organization of the synuclein proteins that has been noted is an 11-residue repeat. This motif, repeated six to seven times in the N-terminal portion of the protein, is reminiscent of the amphipathic α-helical domains of the apolipoproteins and suggests possible lipid binding properties (11Clayton D.F. George J.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The γ-synuclein gene maps to 10q23, is composed of five coding exons, and is transcribed into an mRNA of ∼1 kb (8Lavedan C. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The human γ-synuclein is 127 amino acids long and is 87.7% and 83.3% identical to the mouse and rat proteins, respectively. In addition, comparison of the amino acid sequences indicates that γ-synuclein is highly homologous to α-synuclein and β-synuclein except for the last 27 amino acids of γ-synuclein. Overall, γ-synuclein shares 54%, 56%, and 84% amino acid sequence identity with α-synuclein, β-synuclein, and synoretin, respectively (8Lavedan C. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 9Surguchov A. Surgucheva I. Solessio E. Baehr W. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 13: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Among the synucleins, α-synuclein is the best characterized because of its significant role implicated in neurodegenerative diseases (12Mukaetova-Ladinska E.B. Hurt J. Jakes R. Xuereb J. Honer W.G. Wischik C.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 59: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutations in the α-synuclein gene have been identified in rare kindreds with Parkinson's disease (PD) (12Mukaetova-Ladinska E.B. Hurt J. Jakes R. Xuereb J. Honer W.G. Wischik C.M. J. Neuropathol.

The N-terminal portion of α-synuclein (residues 1–61) shares 40% amino acid homology with members of the 14-3-3 protein family (20Ostrerova N. Petrucelli L. Farrer M. Mehta N. Choi P. Hardy J. Wolozin B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5782-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 14-3-3 family of proteins helps regulate many different signal transduction pathways and is thought to act by directly binding to various protein kinases and bringing them into close proximity with substrate and regulatory proteins. 14-3-3 proteins bind to phospho-serine residues critical for the functions of many kinases and phosphatases that are involved in diverse cell functions (21Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 22Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S.

Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Like the synucleins, 14-3-3 proteins are ubiquitously expressed in the brain and have been shown to associate in a chaperone-like manner with PKC, BAD, ERK, and RAF-1 (16Arawaka S. Saito Y. Murayama S. Mori H. Neurology. 1998; 51: 887-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 21Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). α-Synuclein binds 14-3-3 as well as to PKC, BAD, ERK, and the microtubule-associated protein tau (25Tzivion G. Luo Z. Avruch J. Nature. 1998; 394: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In addition to shared regions of homology to 14-3-3, α-synuclein as well as β- and γ-synuclein also appear to act as a protein chaperone, at least in vitro, by disrupting protein aggregation (26Souza J.M. Giasson B.I. Lee V.M. Ischiropoulos H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To help further unravel the function of γ-synuclein and establish its role in the oncogenesis of breast and ovarian cancer, we searched for proteins that could interact with γ-synuclein and identified the MAPKs ERK1/2 and JNK1. In this study we provide evidence that γ-synuclein contributes to tumor development by protecting cancer cells under adverse conditions through modulating the ERK and JNK pathways. In addition, we observed that paclitaxel- or vinblastine-induced cell death is protected by γ-synuclein, indicating that chemotherapeutic drugs that take effect through activating the JNK apoptosis pathway may not be effective for cancer with high γ-synuclein expression. Paclitaxel, vinblastine, and etoposide were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-ERK1, anti-ERK2, and anti-JNK1 antibodies and normal IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and anti-PARP antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The mouse antibody Syn303 was raised to recombinant human α-synuclein but recognizes α-, β-, and γ-synuclein. γ-2 is a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised to recombinant human γ-synuclein that specifically recognizes human γ-synuclein (27Giasson B.I. Duda J.E. Forman M.S. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Exp. Neurol. 2001; 172: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies Syn204 and Syn207 were raised against human α- and β-synucleins, respectively. Ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and OVCAR5 were maintained in 10% FBS Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% FBS RPMI 1640, respectively. HEK293, human embryonic kidney cells, were maintained in 10% FBS Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with sodium pyruvate and non-essential amino acids. To create the CMV plasmid for establishing stable cell lines over-expressing human α-, β-, or γ-synuclein, human cDNAs were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). GenePorter Transfection Reagent (GTS Inc., San Diego, CA) was used for transfection, and stable cell lines were selected by G418 (Invitrogen). Expression of human α-, β-, or γ-synuclein was confirmed by immunoblotting with Syn204, Syn207, or γ-2 antibody, respectively. For UV treatment, cells at 70–80% confluence were washed once with PBS before UV irradiation (254 nm, 20 J/m2). Complete medium was added to the plates after treatment. The intensity of the UV light source was measured with a BLAK-RAY meter (UVP, Inc., San Gabriel, CA) prior to each experiment. Heat-shock was carried at 42 °C for 15 min. 50 μmsodium arsenite was used to treat the cells for 6 h. Paclitaxel, vinblastine, etoposide, and U0126 were dissolved in Me2SO, and cells were treated with various concentrations of the drugs as indicated in each experiment. Cells at 70–80% confluence were washed twice with ice-cold d-PBS before scraping on ice with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate; 1 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate; 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) per 40 ml of lysis buffer). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) and precleared with protein G-agarose (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD). Protein concentrations were determined with Bio-Rad DC protein assay reagents. Syn303 (3 μl of ascites) or control IgG (3 μg) were preincubated in 500 μl of PBS with 50 μl of protein-G-agarose overnight at 4 °C, and washed twice with PBS before incubation with 300 μg of total cellular lysate for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer before boiling for 5 min. 10 μl of immunoprecipitates was separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis on 4–20% linear gradient Tris-HCl ready gels (Bio-Rad). Proteins separated on SDS-PAGE gels were transferred onto an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000, and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibodies were diluted 1:10,000 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). PerkinElmer Life Sciences Renaissance Enhanced Luminol Reagents (Boston, MA) were used as substrates for detection. For re-use of the same membrane with another primary antibody, Restore Western blot Stripping buffer (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was used to strip the membrane. The results of immunoblotting were quantitated using the program IMAGE (National Institutes of Health) for the integrated density of each band. The kinase activity of JNK was measured using the SAPK/JNK assay kit (Cell Signaling Technologies). Briefly, 250 μl of cell lysate (1 μg/μl protein) was incubated with 2 μg of c-JUN fusion protein beads (in 20 μl) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the proteins on the beads were incubated in the kinase reaction buffer supplemented with 100 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. To measure the JNK activity, the phosphorylated c-JUN was detected by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the specific antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies). Cell viability was determined by Trypan blue exclusion assay and/or WST-1 assay. For Trypan blue assay, cells were stained with 0.2% Trypan blue for 2–5 min. The number of viable cells (non-stained) and dead cells (stained) were counted under a microscope using a cell hemacytometer. For the WST-1 assay, cells under different culture conditions were incubated with WST-1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 4 h. Cleavage of WST-1 to formazan was monitored at 450 nm using a microplate reader. Colorimetric CaspACE assay (Promega) was used to detect the caspase-3 activity. Briefly, pNA released from the substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA by caspase-3 in the cell lysate was monitored at 405 nm using a microplate reader. Where indicated, a two-tailed Studentt test was used to test for significance. We have previously reported that γ-synuclein is highly expressed in the vast majority of late-stage breast and ovarian tumors (4Bruening W. Giasson B.I. Klein-Szanto A.J. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Godwin A.K. Cancer. 2000; 88: 2154-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), suggesting a potentially important role for γ-synuclein in the development of these diseases. To help unravel the function of γ-synuclein, we established several in vitro models. The ovarian tumor cell lines A2780 and OVCAR5, which express low levels of γ-synuclein, as well as kidney HEK293 cells, which do not express detectable levels of γ-synuclein, were transfected with CMV-γ-synuclein or with vector alone and were selected with G418. Resistant colonies were screened by Western blotting for stable expression of γ-synuclein protein, and positive colonies were pooled into A2780gam, OVCAR5gam, and 293gam cell lines (Fig. 1). Cell lines stably expressing α-synuclein and β-synuclein were also derived from A2780 cells as described for the γ-synuclein expressing lines (Fig. 1). Like A2780gam, OVCAR5gam, and 293gam cells, there were no obvious alterations in cell doubling time of the A2780alpha or A2780beta cell lines (data not shown). α-Synuclein has recently been reported to bind directly to the ERK2 kinase (28Iwata A. Miura S. Kanazawa I. Sawada M. Nukina N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 239-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated whether γ-synuclein could also interact with the ERK kinases as well as other MAPKs. By co-immunoprecipitation approaches, we were able to demonstrate a novel association of γ-synucleins with ERK1/2 and JNK1 kinase but not with the p38 kinase (Fig. 2). We also confirmed that α-synuclein is associated with ERK1/2 as well with JNK1 (Fig. 2), which is consistent with the recent studies using neuro2a, a neuronal cell line (29Iwata A. Maruyama M. Kanazawa I. Nukina N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45320-453229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These data indicate that γ- and α-synuclein can interact with ERK1/2 and JNK1 in cancer cells that over-express these proteins. We next evaluated whether these protein interactions would affect the activity of ERK1/2 and/or JNK1 (see below). In A2780 and OVCAR5 cancer cells over-expressing γ-synuclein, the activated ERK1/2 was increased 2- to 3-fold as evidenced by immunoblotting with an anti-phospho-ERK specific antibody (Fig.3). In contrast, α- and β-synucleins appeared to have little or no effect on the activity of ERK1/2 (Fig.3 A), although α-synuclein was also found to be associated with ERK (as described above and shown in Fig. 2) in A2780 cells. In HEK293 cells, the basal level of ERK activation is undetectable and γ-synuclein over-expression does not increase its activation level (Fig. 3 B). Structural analysis indicated that γ-synuclein does not contain any kinase domain, suggesting that the activation of ERK is mediated by other kinase. Because MEK1/2 is required for the activation of ERK1/2 in response to many mitogens, we determined whether MEK1/2 is still required for γ-synuclein-mediated activation of ERK1/2. When cells over-expressing γ-synuclein were treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, the activation of ERK1/2 was suppressed (Fig. 4 A). We further studied the relation of γ-synuclein-ERK interaction and the activation status of ERK1/2. In cells treated with U0126 or serum-starved, the association of γ-synuclein and ERK1/2 was still present (Fig.4 B). These data indicate that γ-synuclein may be constitutively associated with ERK1/2, which could facilitate the activation of ERK by MEK1/2 and lead to the constitutive activation of ERK1/2 in cells over-expressing γ-synuclein.Figure 4Requirement of MEK1/2 for γ-synuclein enhanced ERK1/2 activation. A, A2780 and A2780/gam cells untreated or treated with the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126 (10 μm), were lysed, and 30 μg of proteins was loaded into each lane. As in Fig. 3, anti-phospho-ERK1/2-specific antibody was used to detect activated ERK1/2; the antibody against ERK1/2 was used to detect the protein level of total ERK1/2. B, the interaction between ERK and γ-synuclein is independent of the activation status of ERK1/2. A2780/gam cells in normal 10% FBS medium, 10% FBS medium with U0126 (10 μm), or serum-free medium were lysed and immunoprecipitated with Syn303 or control IgG. The proteins in the immunoprecipitates were detected with the antibodies against ERK1/2 or against human γ-synuclein (γ-2). The autoradiogram shown is representative of three independent experiments with comparable results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) JNK is activated by stress signals, including UV, which leads to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis (30Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3666) Google Scholar). The basal level of JNK activity in A2780 and OVCAR5 ovarian cancer cells is very low in untreated cells whether γ-synuclein was over-expressed or not (Fig. 5). JNK was highly activated in the parental cells when treated with UV (Fig. 5). In cells over-expressing γ-synuclein, the activation of JNK was almost completely blocked in A2780/gam cells (p < 0.05) and was down-regulated by ∼50% in OVCAR5/gam cells when treated with UV (Fig. 5) or heat-shock (data not shown). The blockage of JNK activation by UV appears to be γ-synuclein-specific, because over-expression of α- and β-synucleins appeared to have little or no effect on the activation of JNK by UV (Fig. 5 and data not shown). The inhibition of JNK activation in OVCAR5/gam cells is much less than that in A2780/gam cells. The cause of this difference could either be cell-type specific or it could be the high endogenous γ-synuclein expression in OVCAR5 cells. Similarly, the activation of JNK by sodium arsenate was blocked to different extents by γ-synuclein in 293/gam, OVCAR5/gam, and A2780/gam cells (Fig.6). Collectively, these data indicate that stress-induced activation of JNK can be blocked by γ-synuclein over-expression in a variety of cell lines.Figure 6JNK activation is down-regulated by over-expression of γ-synuclein in response to sodium arsenate. HEK293, OVCAR5, and A2780 cells and their γ-synuclein over-expressing counterparts were treated with sodium arsenite (50 μm) for 6 h. Cells were lysed, and the extracts were assayed for JNK activity as described in the legends for Fig. 5. The number beneath each band represents the arbitrary densitometry units of the corresponding band. The blots shown here are representative of three independent experiments with comparable results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Based on the data presented above, we hypothesized that γ-synuclein may contribute to cancer cell survival by up-regulating the ERK cell survival pathway and by suppressing the JNK apoptosis pathway under adverse conditions. However, when we treated γ-synuclein over-expressing cells with UV, significant differences in cell survival between A2780 and A2780/gam cells were not observed (data not shown). The reason for this lack of difference is not readily apparent. However, cell survival and cell death are regulated by the counterbalance between the survival factors and the apoptotic signaling pathways. Because UV treatment also activates the cell survival pathways ERK (Ref. 31Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar and data not shown) and PI3K-AKT (32Krasilnikov M. Adler V. Fuchs S.Y. Dong Z. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Herlyn M. Ronai Z. Mol.

In support of these findings we did not observe the cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate PARP in A2780 cells when treated with UV (data not shown). We next evaluated the survival of γ-synuclein over-expressing cells in response to Taxol, a commonly used chemotherapeutic drug. In addition to its role in affecting microtubule assembly, Taxol is known to lead to apoptosis via the mitochondria by activating the JNK signaling pathway and Taxol-induced apoptosis can be enhanced by MEK inhibition (34Lee L.F., Li, G.

In A2780 cells, Taxol did not affect the basal level activity of ERK or the activation of ERK by γ-synuclein (Fig.7 A). To test the effect of γ-synuclein on cell survival, cells were treated with Taxol for varying lengths of time. At 48 h after treatment, 45–60% of A2780 cells had died, whereas only about 7–15% of A2780/gam cells were dead indicating that Taxol-induced cell death can be rescued by γ-synuclein over-expression (Fig. 7 B). When ERK activation was inhibited using the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, the cell death was reduced by ∼25% in A2780 cells but was nearly doubled in A2780/gam cells"

Unlike most prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, in which the major thiol component is GSH, members of the Kinetoplastida rely on a glutathione-spermidine conjugate named trypanothione [N 1,N 8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine] (7Fairlamb A.H.

Science. 1985; 227: 1485-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Trypanothione, together with its associated enzyme, trypanothione reductase, appears to have replaced many of the antioxidant and metabolic functions of the glutathione/glutathione reductase and thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase systems in other organisms (9Fairlamb A.H.

Since trypanothione reductase is essential for parasite survival, inhibition of the biosynthesis of its substrate offers an additional target for therapeutic intervention. The biosynthesis of trypanothione involves two metabolic pathways that are distinct in other organisms: i.e. spermidine and GSH biosynthesis (19Fairlamb A.H. Henderson G.B. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the African trypanosome, exemplified byTrypanosoma brucei, spermidine is synthesized from ornithine via putrescine and subsequently conjugated with GSH to produce glutathionylspermidine and then trypanothione (20Fairlamb A.H. Henderson G.B. Bacchi C.J. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 24: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the South American trypanosome Trypanosoma cruzi, polyamines cannot be synthesized de novo from their precursor amino acids (ornithine, arginine or lysine) (21Hunter K.J., Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Instead, exogenous putrescine and cadaverine can be readily taken up and converted via spermidine or aminopropylcadaverine into trypanothione or homotrypanothione [N 1,N 9-bis(glutathionyl)aminopropylcadaverine], respectively (21Hunter K.J., Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 1019-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The biosynthesis of homotrypanothione seems to be unique to T. cruzi, a parasite that has evolved a number of inducible high-affinity transporters for putrescine, cadaverine, and spermidine that are not found in T. brucei (22Le Quesne S.A. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Biosynthesis of trypanothione involves ATP-dependent conjugation of GSH to both primary amines of spermidine (19Fairlamb A.H. Henderson G.B. Cerami A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The original report (23Henderson G.B. Yamaguchi M. Novoa L. Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3924-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) of a single enzyme from Crithidia fasciculata converting GSH and spermidine into trypanothione (trypanothione synthetase) was superseded by the identification of two distinct ATP-dependent enzymes involved in the synthesis of trypanothione (24Smith K. Nadeau K. Walsh C. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Science. 1992; 1: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 25Koenig K. Menge U. Kiess M. Wray V. Flohé L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11908-11915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar): a glutathionylspermidine synthetase (GspS,1 EC 6.3.1.8) that forms both N 1- andN 8-glutathionylspermidine and a trypanothione synthetase (TryS, EC 6.3.1.9) that catalyzes addition of a second GSH to either of the preceding intermediates (23Henderson G.B. Yamaguchi M. Novoa L. Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3924-3929Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, genes for both GspS and TryS have been cloned from C. fasciculata and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae(26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Although expression levels were too low to detect enzyme activity in cell extracts, thiol analysis of yeast transformed withCfGspS showed the presence of glutathionylspermidine and those containing both CfGspS andCfTryS trypanothione (26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The fact that no glutathionylspermidine or trypanothione was found in yeast transformed with CfTryS alone is consistent with previous reports that CfTryS is unable to synthesize glutathionylspermidine (24Smith K. Nadeau K. Walsh C. Fairlamb A.H. Protein Science. 1992; 1: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The physical and kinetic properties ofCfGspS have been confirmed by subsequent studies on recombinant enzyme purified from E. coli (27Oza S.L. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Like the E. coli enzyme (EcGspS),CfGspS also has an amidase activity associated with the N-terminal domain of the protein that can hydrolyze glutathionylspermidine to GSH and spermidine (26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).CfGspS can also hydrolyze trypanothione at 1.5% of the rate with glutathionylspermidine (27Oza S.L. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments indicate that CfTryS has a similar domain, although amidase activity with either glutathionylspermidine or trypanothione has not been demonstrated. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of TrySfrom T. cruzi and describe some of the physical and kinetic properties of the enzyme. In contrast to C. fasciculata, we demonstrate that a single enzyme is capable of making both glutathionylspermidine and trypanothione from spermidine, as well as glutathionylaminopropylcadaverine and homotrypanothione from aminopropylcadaverine. We also show that the enzyme is a bifunctional synthetase/amidase capable of hydrolyzing trypanothione, homotrypanothione, and glutathionylspermidine. The implications ofCfGspS as a model for drug development against Chagas disease is discussed. Trypanosoma cruzi Silvio X10 clone 7 was used as source for DNA. Routine DNA manipulations were performed in E. coli strain JM109 and XL1-Blue. Expression of recombinant proteins employed E. coli strains BL21(DE3) and BL21(DE3)pLysS or S. cerevisiae ABYS106. All chemicals were of the highest grade available from Sigma, Merck, or CALBIOCHEM. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Promega. Two degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on an alignment of EcGspS (28Bollinger Jr., J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14031-14041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), CfGspS (26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol.

A 1344-bp PCR product was identified following agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into the SmaI site of pUC18 (SureClone kit, AmershamBiosciences) giving the plasmid pUC18-TcTryS and sequenced (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52658) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from T. cruzi (30Bernards A. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Frasch A.C.C. Borst P. Boothroyd J.C. Coleman S. Cross G.A.M. Cell. 1981; 27: 497-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), digested withPstI or SalI or KpnI and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA in the size range 3–4 kb (PstI), 1.6–2 kb (KpnI), and 1–1.6 kb (SalI) were isolated (QIAEX Extraction Kit, Qiagen), ligated to pUC18 vector (digested with PstI or SalI orKpnI and dephosphorylated, Appligene) and transformed inE. coli XL1-Blue. The PstI, KpnI, andSalI sublibraries each contained about 20,000 recombinant plasmids. Following digestion of pUC18-TcTryS withEcoRI-HindIII, the cloned DTC5/DTC2 PCR fragment was isolated, labeled with [32P]dCTP by the random primer method (Ready Prime, Amersham Biosciences) and used to screen ∼10,000 clones from each of the sublibraries (26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis of T. cruzi genomic DNA (2 μg) was performed using the 32P-labeled DTC5/DTC2 PCR probe (26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Yeast strain ABYS106 expressing TcTryS was obtained by transformation with the gene cloned in the expression vector pRB1438 under the control of the GAL10 promoter. The coding sequence was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide TCTRS5′ 5′-GGGAA TTC ATG ACG ACT CTA AAG TCT TTG-3′ for the sense strand containing an EcoRI cloning site (underlined), and an antisense strand oligonucleotide TCTRS3′: 5′-CC GAA TTC TCA CGT TTT CAA GCC ACC ACC-3′, which includes a stop codon with aEcoRI restriction site (underlined). The PCR product was subsequently cloned in pUC18 and then transferred into pRB1438 creating plasmid pRB1438-TcTryS. The orientation of the gene was determined using the KpnI restriction site. Yeast co-expressing both CfGspS and TcTrySwere obtained by transformation with the genes cloned in the expression vector pRB1438 under the control of the GAL1 and/or GAL10 promoters. The T. cruzi coding sequence was removed from the pUC18 plasmid by digestion with EcoRI and ligated into the pRB1438-CfGspS vector (26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) creating the plasmid pRB1438-CfGspS-TcTryS. The orientation of the gene was determined using KpnI. Yeast transformants were cultured and induced with galactose and lysed exactly as described previously (26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P.

Thiols were determined by ion-paired, reverse-phase HPLC following derivatization of 2 × 107 cells with monobromobimane (31Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar). Polyamines were determined by HPLC after derivatization of 2 × 107 cells with dansyl chloride (32Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 33Kabra P.M. Lee H.K. Lubich W.P. Marton L.J. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 380: 19-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The complete open reading frame of TcTryS was amplified by PCR from T.cruzi genomic DNA using forward and reverse primers containing NdeI restriction sites. The PCR product was blunt-end ligated into the SmaI site of pUC18 (SureClone kit from Amersham Biosciences) and sequenced to ensure that the correct product had been obtained. The insert was removed by digestion with NdeI and ligated into pET15b (Novagen) creating plasmid pET15b-TcTryS. The correct orientation of the gene was confirmed using the BamHI and XhoI restriction sites. BL21(DE3)pLysS [pET15b-TcTryS] was grown at 37 °C with vigorous agitation (220 rpm) in Terrific Broth containing 50 μg ml−1 carbenicillin and 12.5 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol. When the culture reached an OD600 of ∼0.6, it was cooled to 22–25 °C, induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and harvested after 16 h. Recombinant TcTryS was purified from cell extracts by chromatography on nickel-chelated Sepharose, digested with thrombin to remove the His6 tag and purified to homogeneity by anion exchange chromatography on ResourceQ (AmershamBiosciences) (27Oza S.L. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The concentrated sample was stored at −20 °C in 40% glycerol, 0.01% sodium azide in 0.1-ml aliquots. Under these conditions the enzyme is completely stable for at least two months. Subunit size and purity ofTcTryS was determined by SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% gradient gel. Samples were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for N-terminal sequencing by pulsed liquid Edman sequencing on a Procise 494 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). MALDI-TOF protein was analyzed in linear mode using sinapinic acid as a matrix on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). The relative molecular mass of the native protein was determined by chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (27Oza S.L. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis (K m and k cat values) and pH optimization studies of synthetase activity were performed by spectrophotometric assay at 340 nm, in which hydrolysis of ATP is coupled through pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase to oxidation of NADH. Each assay contained 100 mm (K+) HEPPS, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgSO4, 2 units ml−1l-lactate dehydrogenase, 2 units ml−1 pyruvate kinase, 0.8 μm TcTryS, and varying amounts of substrates. Initial rates were determined at 9 different substrate concentrations with fixed (saturating) concentrations of the co-substrates (i.e. 2 mm MgATP, 1 mm GSH, and either 10 mm spermidine or 1 mm glutathionylspermidine). The pH optimum of the enzyme was determined as above in a mixed buffer system containing 16.6 mm each of MES, CHES, and HEPPS (pH adjusted using KOH) with 20 units ml−1 of each coupling enzyme. The effect of ionic strength was determined as above in 50 mm HEPPS buffer, pH 8 plus 0–500 mm KCl or (NH4)2SO4. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 μmol of NADH oxidized per min. Kinetic parameters (± S.E. of the mean) were determined using the Michaelis-Menten equation by non-linear fitting with the program GraFit. Recombinant TcTryS (7.6 μg, 1.025 μm final concentration) was added to 100 μl of 50 mm bis-Tris propane, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgSO4, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm NADPH, 0.5 units of trypanothione reductase, 0.8 mm GSH, and either 0.8 mm spermidine or 0.8 mm GspdSH. Control samples contained heat-inactivated TcTryS (100 °C, 5 min). After 1 h at 37 °C, 10-μl aliquots were derivatized with monobromobimane and analyzed by HPLC (31Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar). The pH optimum for the amidase activity was determined using the mixed buffer system described above in a final volume of 20 μl containing 0.4 mmglutathionylspermidine (0.2 mm glutathionylspermidine disulfide reduced with 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and 20 μm Tc-TryS. Samples were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and analyzed by HPLC (31Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar). In subsequent experiments, amidase activity of TcTryS was determined under linear conditions in 20 μl of 0.1 m HEPPS, pH 8.0 containing 18.4 μm enzyme and either 0.5 mmtrypanothione disulfide, 0.5 mm homotrypanothione disulfide, or 0.25 mm glutathionylspermidine disulfide reduced with 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, 10-μl aliquots were derivatized and analyzed by HPLC (31Shim H. Fairlamb A.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 807-817PubMed Google Scholar). CfGspS amidase activity was determined under the same assay conditions in a total volume of 50 μl containing 2 μm enzyme with trypanothione or homotrypanothione as substrate and 0.0025–0.1 μmenzyme for glutathionylspermidine. Using the degenerate oligonucleotide primers DTC5/DTC2 described under “Experimental Procedures,” a 1344-bp fragment was amplified by PCR from T. cruzi genomic DNA and cloned into pUC18 giving the plasmid pUC18-TcTryS. Sequence analysis verified that this DNA fragment encoded a protein with sequence similarity to TryS from C. fasciculata (26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and GspS from E. coli (28Bollinger Jr., J.M. Kwon D.S. Huisman G.W. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14031-14041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) or C. fasciculata(26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). T. cruzi genomic DNA was digested with several restriction enzymes and probed with the DTC5/DTC2 PCR fragment labeled with [32P]dCTP (Fig.2 A). The probe hybridized to a single ∼4-kb PstI fragment, two KpnI fragments (∼1.7 kb and ∼ 0.4 kb, arrow) and twoSalI fragments (∼10 kb and ∼1.3 kb, arrow). The labeled probe was then used to screen the PstI,KpnI, and SalI sublibraries (see “Experimental Procedures”). Seven clones were isolated from the PstI sublibrary, all of which contained a DNA fragment of ∼4 kb; 1 clone was isolated from the KpnI sublibrary, which contained a DNA fragment of ∼1.7 kb; and 3 clones were isolated from theSalI sublibrary, which contained a DNA fragment of ∼1.3 kb. Preliminary sequence analysis of the PstI,KpnI, and SalI clones revealed partial open reading frames with similarity to the C. fasciculatasynthetases. Using the SalI and KpnI clones, which encode the N and C-terminal regions of the protein, respectively, we were able to reconstitute a full-length clone (Fig. 2 B). A PCR product overlapping the PstI, KpnI, andSalI restriction sites was cloned and sequenced to confirm there were no errors at these restriction sites. No sequence variations were found in any of the cloned fragments, suggesting that we have cloned one allelic copy. Moreover, the restriction patterns (Fig. 2,A and B) suggest that TcTryS is single copy per haploid genome of T. cruzi since the probe hybridized to a single band when DNA was digested with enzymes that do not cut within the coding sequence (EcoRI andHindIII), whereas the probe hybridized to two fragments when the DNA was digested with enzymes that cut at a single site within the coding sequence (BamHI, SalI, andKpnI). Translation of TrySfrom T. cruzi predicts a protein of 647 amino acids with a molecular mass of 73,560 Da. TcTryS shows strongest homology to CfTryS (75% similarity and 61% identity in sequence alignments), followed by EcGspS (51% similarity and 34% identity) and CfGspS (45% similarity and 31% identity) (Fig. 3). Like CfTryS, TcTryS lacks six major insertions found in CfGspS (residues 57–73, 270–276, 321–324, 400–404, 467–480, and 597–635,overlined in Fig. 3). Significant homology was found betweenTcTryS and EcGspS in the N-terminal region, which is responsible for the glutathionylspermidine amidase activity of theE. coli protein (28Bollinger Jr., J.M.

Walsh C.T. Bollinger Jr., J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2429-2436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, a cysteine residue, corresponding to Cys-59 of EcGspS and Cys-79CfGspS that have been shown by site-directed mutagenesis to be essential for amidase activity (27Oza S.L. Ariyanayagam M.R. Fairlamb A.H. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35Lin C.-H. Kwon D.S. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14930-14938Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), is present in TcTryS, suggesting that this enzyme may also possess amidase activity (see below). Having completed our sequencing study, two similar sequences fromT. cruzi CL Brener (43-CL F11F5) were deposited by theT. cruzi genome project annotated as putative trypanothione synthetases (accession numbers AF283000 and AF283001). These sequences show about 96% identity to each other and also to Silvio X10 clone 7 used in this study. This is consistent with the recent report that CL-Brener is a hybrid of clades B and C belonging to lineage II and distinct from X10 clone 7, which belongs to clade A of lineage I (36Machado C.A. Ayala F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7396-7401Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). TcTryS was cloned into pRB1438 for inducible expression in S. cerevisiae ABYS106 as previously described (26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Galactose-induced transformants containing pRB1438-TcTryS or pRB1438- CfGspS-TcTryS showed no overexpression of protein (by SDS-PAGE), and no detectable enzymatic activity above endogenous ATPase activity (using the coupled assay method), as previously described for the Crithidia enzymes (26Tetaud E.

However, evidence for enzyme activity could be demonstrated by HPLC analysis of thiols in yeast transformants (Fig.4). In control cells, the principal thiol is GSH (38 nmol [108 cells]−1) (26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol.

No glutathionylspermidine or trypanothione-bimane adducts are evident in the control cells (compare Fig. 4 A with standards in Fig.4 D). Since we had previously demonstrated that cells transformed with pRB1438-CfTryS do not form trypanothione, unless co-expressed with CfGspS (26Tetaud E. Manai F. Barrett M.P. Nadeau K. Walsh C.T.

However, the molecular events that control the degradation of syntaxin 1 remain undefined. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel RING finger protein, Staring, that interacts with syntaxin 1. Staring is expressed throughout the brain, where it exists in both cytosolic and membrane-associated pools. Staring binds and recruits the brain-enriched E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH8 to syntaxin 1 and facilitates the ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of syntaxin 1. These findings suggest that Staring is a novel E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets syntaxin 1 for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

Modulation of protein degradation is a major mechanism by which cells regulate the expression levels of specific proteins and consequently the cellular processes that these proteins participate in (1Schwartz A.L.

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a crucial role in the degradation of proteins involved in a variety of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis. However, the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the degradation of presynaptic proteins remains poorly characterized, despite the presence of ubiquitin at nerve terminals (3Chapman A.P.

The ubiquitinated substrate proteins are then recognized and degraded by the 26 S proteasome (1Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev.

The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase plays an essential role in determining the specificity of ubiquitination and subsequent protein degradation. Consistent with this role, it is estimated that an organism such as a human contains over 100 E3 ubiquitin ligases, in contrast to a single E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and about a dozen E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (9Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6958) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases in specific protein degradation and the estimated presence of more than 100 E3 ligases in the human genome, only a few E3 ligases have been characterized at the molecular level. Syntaxin 1 is a neuronal membrane protein that was originally identified as a binding partner for synaptotagmin and the N-type calcium channel (10Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H.

It is well established that syntaxin 1 functions as a synaptic t-SNARE to mediate synaptic vesicle exocytosis at nerve terminals (13Rothman J.E.

Regulation of syntaxin 1 levels may contribute to the mechanism underlying learning and memory, since changes in syntaxin 1 levels have been found to correlate with long term potentiation and various learning and memory behaviors (20Davis S.

Despite the importance of the regulation of syntaxin 1 levels in synaptic function and dysfunction, the molecular mechanisms underlying such regulation remain undefined. To identify proteins that regulate syntaxin 1, we carried out a search in rat brain for proteins that interact with syntaxin 1 using yeast two-hybrid screens. Here we report the isolation of a novel syntaxin 1-interacting protein, named Staring, that acts as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of syntaxin 1 by the proteasome pathway. The bait plasmid, pPC97-Syntaxin 1, was constructed by subcloning the cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 5–270) of rat syntaxin 1B (27Kwong J. Roundabush F.L. Moore P.H. Montague M. Oldham W., Li, Y. Chin L. Li L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2273-2284PubMed Google Scholar) into the pPC97 vector (28Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). For the two-hybrid screen, the yeast strain CG-1945 (CLONTECH) was transformed sequentially with pPC97-Syntaxin 1 and a rat hippocampal/cortical two-hybrid cDNA library (29Li X.J., Li, S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), using the lithium acetate method (30Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Positive clones were selected on 3-aminotriazole (5 mm; Sigma)-containing medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine and verified with a filter assay for β-galactosidase activity. Prey plasmids were then recovered and retransformed into yeast with pPC97-Syntaxin 1 or various control baits to confirm the specificity of the interaction. For cloning of full-length Staring, a partial Staring cDNA probe from the prey clone (clone 7) was used to screen a rat hippocampal cDNA library in λZAPII (Stratagene) according to the standard procedure (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNA inserts from positive Staring clones were sequenced multiple times on both strands using an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. Conventional molecular biological techniques (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used to subclone DNA fragments encoding full-length and truncated forms of Staring into the following vectors: the pPC97 and pPC86 vectors for yeast two-hybrid interaction studies; the prokaryotic expression vectors pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences) and pET28c (Novagen) for the production of GST- and His6-tagged fusion proteins; and the mammalian expression vectors pCDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and pCHA (30Chin L.S.

The expression construct pRK5-HA-UbcH5, pRK5-HA-UbcH7, and pRK5-HA-UbcH8 were obtained as generous gifts from Dr. Ted Dawson (32Zhang Y. Gao J. Chung K.K. Huang H. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl.

Four polyclonal anti-Staring antibodies, two in chicken (CS-N and CS-C) and two in rabbit (RS-N and RS-C), were generated against Staring N-terminal peptide MSGLSNKRAAGDGG and C-terminal peptide AAFGAHDFHRVYIS, respectively. The antibodies were affinity-purified using the immunogen peptide-coupled columns as described previously (30Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used in this study include the following: anti-HA (3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and HA.11 (Covance)), anti-Myc (9E10.3; Neomarkers), anti-syntaxin 1 (HPC-1; Sigma), anti-actin (C4; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and secondary antibodies coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.). Northern blot analysis of Staring mRNA expression was performed on a rat multiple tissue Northern (MTNTM) blot and a human multiple tissue expression (MTETM) array (CLONTECH), using a 32P-labeled Staring cDNA fragment from clone 7 as the probe (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, rat tissues were homogenized in 1% SDS and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-Staring and other antibodies. Antibody binding was detected by using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Subcellular fractionations of rat brain into cytosol fraction (100,000 × gsupernatant) and membrane fraction (100,000 × gpellet) were preformed as previously described (30Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The membrane fractions were subjected to extraction studies as described (30Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C. Vavalle J.P. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), using 1.5 m NaCl or 4 m urea. GST-Staring fusion proteins or GST control were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and incubated with rat brain homogenates as previously described (30Chin L.S. Nugent R.D. Raynor M.C.

After extensive washes, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. HeLa or SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (34Chin L.-S. Raynor M.C. Wei X. Chen H. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7069-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), using anti-HA antibody (3F10), anti-Myc (9E10.3), anti-Staring (RS-N), anti-syntaxin 1 antibody (HPC-1), or control IgG. The immunocomplexes were recovered by incubation with protein G- or protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). After extensive washes, the immunocomplexes were dissociated by boiling in the Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. HeLa cells were transfected with combinations of the following plasmids: pCHA-syntaxin 1, pcDNA3-Myc-ubiquitin, pFLAG-Staring, and pFLAG-StaringΔR, a C-terminal deletion mutant of Staring that lacks the RING finger motif. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with pcDNA3-Myc-ubiquitin in combination with pFLAG-Staring or pFLAG-StaringΔR. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were incubated for 8 h with 20 μm MG132 (Calbiochem). The cells were then lysed, and an equal amount of protein from each lysate was immunoprecipitated using antibodies against HA tag or syntaxin 1 (34Chin L.-S. Raynor M.C. Wei X. Chen H. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7069-7078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc antibody to detect Myc-ubiquitin conjugated to syntaxin 1. HeLa cells were co-transfected with pCHA-syntaxin 1 and either pFLAG-Staring or pFLAG vector control. SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with pFLAG-Staring or pFLAG vector control. To control for the transfection efficiency, cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE in a 150-mm culture dish. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were divided into eight 60-mm dishes, each of which was used for a single chase time point. At 48 h post-transfection, cells in the 60-mm dishes were washed and incubated for 30 min with Met/Cys-free DMEM. The medium was then replaced with Met/Cys-free DMEM containing 200 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys (1000 Ci/mmol) express protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After incubation for 1 h, the radioactive medium was removed by extensive washes with nonradioactive DMEM. Cells in each 60-mm dish were then incubated for the indicated chase time in nonradioactive DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5 times the normal concentration of methionine and cysteine as described previously (35Wheeler T.C. Chin L.S., Li, Y. Roudabush F.L. Li L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10273-10282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cells were then lysed, and an equal amount of protein from each lysate was immunoprecipitated using an anti-HA antibody. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). HeLa or SH-SY5Y cells expressing Staring and syntaxin 1 were incubated for 8 h at 37 °C with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 μm;Calbiochem), the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64 (50 μm; Sigma), the lysosomal protease inhibitor NH4Cl (50 mm) or chloroquine (100 μm; Sigma), or vehicle (Me2SO; final concentration 0.1%). Cells were then lysed, and the protein concentrations of the lysates were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). An equal amount of protein from each lysate was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To identify syntaxin 1-interacting proteins, we screened a rat hippocampal/cortical cDNA library by yeast two-hybrid selection using the cytoplasmic domain of rat syntaxin 1B as bait. This screen led to the isolation of several clones encoding SNAP-25, a known syntaxin 1-interacting protein (data not shown), confirming the validity of the two-hybrid screen. One of the positive clones was shown to encode part of a novel protein that we referred to as Staring (because it is asyntaxin 1-interacting RING finger protein (Fig. 1 A). Retransformation experiments confirmed that Staring interacts specifically with syntaxin 1A and syntaxin 1B but not with SNAP-25 or SNAP-23 (data not shown). Since SNAP-25 and SNAP-23 contain coiled-coil t-SNARE domains that are homologous to the t-SNARE domain of syntaxin 1 (36Weimbs T. Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), the inability of Staring to interact with SNAP-25 and SNAP-23 further confirms the specificity of the Staring-syntaxin 1 interaction. Cloning of the full-length Staring cDNA revealed that Staring is a 1002-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 113.8 kDa. The sequence surrounding the initiator methionine codon of Staring conforms well to the translation initiation consensus sequence (37Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) and is preceded by an in-frame stop codon in the 5′-untranslated region. Furthermore, the coding sequence of Staring beginning with this methionine initiator can be expressed in mammalian cells to yield a recombinant protein with an apparent molecular weight similar to that of endogenous Staring (data not shown), confirming that the cloned Staring sequence contains the entire coding region. Staring is highly hydrophilic, with a theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of 6.13 and a high percentage (34%) of charged amino acids over the entire length. Staring contains neither a signal sequence nor a potential transmembrane domain. As shown in Fig. 1, Staring contains six putative coiled-coil domains and a RING finger motif at the C terminus. The RING finger motif is a cysteine/histidine-rich (C3HC4), Zn2+ binding domain that is found in a number of eukaryotic proteins, some of which have been implicated in vesicular transport (38Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence indicates that the RING finger motif may function in protein ubiquitination as a key determinant of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity (39Borden K.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 40Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 41Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of rat Staring is 90% identical to human RBP95, an 838-amino acid protein recently identified from a yeast two-hybrid screen using retinoblastoma protein as bait (42Wen H. Ao S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The expression of endogenous RBP95 protein has not yet been characterized; however, based on EST data base searches, RBP95 seems to be a rare isoform derived from alternative splicing of the gene encoding the uncharacterized human ring finger protein 40 (RNF40, also called KIAA0661) (Fig.2 A). Data base searches reveal the presence of Staring homologues as uncharacterized cDNAs or open reading frames obtained from genome projects in a number of organisms, including humans, mice,Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans,Arabidopsis, and yeast (Fig. 2 A). Sequence comparison analysis indicates that RNF40 is the human orthologue of rat Staring. The human genome also contains a second Staring homologue, RNF20, which is encoded by a gene that is distinct from the RNF40 gene. In Drosophila, C. elegans,Arabidopsis, and yeast, there appears to be only one Staring homologue. Whereas the function of these Staring homologues is unknown, the deletion mutant of the yeast Staring homologue, Bre1p (also called YDL074c), was reported to be sensitive to multiple drugs, including brefeldin A and chlorpromazine (43Rieger K.J., El- Alama M. Stein G. Bradshaw C. Slonimski P.P. Maundrell K. Yeast. 1999; 15: 973-986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Muren E. Oyen M. Barmark G. Ronne H. Yeast. 2001; 18: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Analysis of the deduced proteins from the Staring-homologous sequences reveals that these homologous proteins have a domain structure that is similar to that of Staring (Fig. 2 A). Most notably, these Staring homologues contain a highly conserved RING finger motif at their C terminus (Fig.2 B). The conspicuous homology and conserved domain structure among Staring homologues from different species indicate that Staring is an evolutionarily conserved protein. Northern blot analysis of Staring mRNA expression revealed the presence of a single Staring transcript of 5.1 kb (Fig.3 A). The Staring mRNA is relatively abundant in brain, testis, heart, liver, and kidney and expressed at low levels in lung, spleen, and skeletal muscle. Consistent with this result, analysis of human Staring mRNA expression using a multiple tissue expression array showed that Staring mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in various brain regions as well as all fetal and adult human tissues examined (data not shown). The broad tissue distribution of Staring mRNA expression suggests that Staring has a functional role important to many cell types, including neurons. To characterize Staring at the protein level, we generated four polyclonal anti-Staring antibodies, two in chicken (CS-N and CS-C) and two in rabbit (RS-N and RS-C), against the N- and C-terminal 14-amino acid peptide of rat Staring, respectively. The antibodies (CS-N and RS-N) against the N terminus of Staring are expected to detect both Staring and RBP95 isoforms, whereas the antibodies (CS-C and RS-C) against the C terminus of Staring should only recognize the Staring isoform. Western blot analysis demonstrated that all four anti-Staring antibodies, but not their corresponding preimmune controls, recognized a single endogenous protein band of ∼125 kDa (Fig. 3, Band C; data not shown), indicating that Staring is the predominant isoform expressed in rat. No 95-kDa protein band corresponding to RBP95 could be detected by either chicken (CS-N) or rabbit (RS-N) antibodies against the N terminus of Staring (Fig.3 B; data not shown), suggesting that RBP95 is a rare isoform that is either expressed at extremely low levels or not expressed at all. All four anti-Staring antibodies specifically react with recombinant Staring protein expressed in bacterial and mammalian cells (data not shown). Furthermore, preabsorption of these anti-Staring antibodies with recombinant Staring protein completely eliminated their immunoreactivity to recombinant as well as endogenous Staring protein (data not shown), confirming the specificity of these antibodies. In agreement with the result of Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3 A), Western blot analysis using the anti-Staring antibodies revealed that Staring protein is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested, although the expression levels in heart and skeletal muscle are very low (Fig. 3 B). To examine the intracellular distribution of endogenous Staring, postnuclear supernatant of rat brain was separated into cytosol and membrane fractions and then subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-Staring antibodies (Fig. 3 C). Staring immunoreactivity was detected in both cytosol and membrane fraction, although the relative amount of Staring in the cytosol fraction was severalfold more than that in the membrane fraction. To investigate the nature of Staring association with membranes, the membrane fraction was extracted with 1.5 m NaCl or 4 m urea (Fig.3 C). Unlike the integral membrane protein syntaxin 1 that was resistant to extraction by high salt and urea, a majority of Staring was extracted by these treatments, suggesting that Staring is peripherally associated with membranes via hydrophilic interactions. To determine whether the Staring-syntaxin 1 interaction detected in yeast actually takes place in vitro, GST fusion proteins containing various portions of Staring (Fig.4 A) were immobilized on glutathione beads and used to bind endogenous syntaxin 1 from rat brain homogenate. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the GST-fusion proteins bearing the full-length Staring or the Staring fragments that contain the predicted coiled-coil domain H3 (Staring Δ1 and Staring Δ2) was able to bind endogenous syntaxin 1. In contrast, the GST-Staring fusion protein containing the coiled-coil domain H4 (Staring Δ3) or GST alone was unable to pull down syntaxin 1, confirming that the observed Staring-syntaxin 1 interaction is specific. These data indicate that the syntaxin 1-binding site of Staring lies within the H3 domain, between amino acid residues 448 and 536. In addition, other parts of Staring seem to also contribute to the interaction with syntaxin 1, since the GST-fusion proteins containing truncated forms of Staring bound much less syntaxin 1 than a similar amount of the full-length GST-Staring (Fig. 4 A). To determine whether Staring associates with syntaxin 1 in vivo, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using lysates of HeLa cells expressing exogenous syntaxin 1 and HA-tagged Staring. As shown in Fig. 4 C, syntaxin 1 and HA-Staring were co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-HA antibody, providing evidence for the association of these two proteins in mammalian cells. By comparison, control IgG was unable to precipitate either syntaxin 1 or Staring. We then performed additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments to examine the association of endogenous Staring and syntaxin 1 in rat brain synaptosomes (Fig. 4 D). Anti-syntaxin 1 antibody, but not the mouse IgG control, was able to co-immunoprecipitate syntaxin 1 and Staring from solubilized synaptosomes, demonstrating the existence of endogenous Staring-syntaxin 1 complexes at nerve terminals. Under our experiment conditions, ∼10% of total endogenous Staring was co-immunoprecipitated with syntaxin 1, indicating that only a fraction of Staring and syntaxin 1 co-exist in the Staring-syntaxin 1 complexes. These results are consistent with previous reports that syntaxin 1 interacts with more than a dozen proteins, including SNAP-25, nSec1/Munc-18, Munc-13, tomosyn, and syntaphilin (14Jahn R.

In an effort to elucidate the role of this interactionin vivo, the PDZK1-interacting domain of SR-BI was identified and mutated and expressed liver-specifically in mice. The PDZKI-interacting domain on SR-BI was identified as the last three carboxyl-terminal amino acids, Arg-Lys-Leu. A mutant SR-BI (SR-BIdel509) that lacked only the leucine in the PDZ-interacting domain failed to interact with PDZK1 in vitro, while showing normal selective uptake function in nonpolarized cells. Transgenic mice with liver overexpression of SR-BIdel509 showed marked accumulation of SR-BI mRNA with only a moderate increase in SR-BI protein in liver, with no reduction in plasma cholesterol levels. Measurement of cell surface SR-BI levels and HDL cholesteryl ester-selective uptake in primary hepatocytes from transgenic mice revealed that SR-BIdel509 was not expressed at the plasma membrane correlating with normal levels of selective uptake compared with hepatocytes from nontransgenic littermates.

The carboxyl terminus of transmembrane proteins often contain membrane targeting signals, signaling domains, and protein-protein interaction motifs.Recently, a PDZ domain-containing protein called CLAMP (PDZK1/Diphor-1/CAP70/NaPi-Cap1) was purified from rat liver extracts by affinity chromatography using the carboxyl terminus of SR-BI (13Ikemoto M.

Lipidol. 2001; 12: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, CLAMP may act to scaffold proteins at the plasma membrane. A review of the literature reveals that CLAMP was first identified in 1997 as a protein (diphor-1) induced in rat kidney by dietary phosphate starvation (21Custer M. Spindler B. Verrey F. Murer H. Biber J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F801-F806PubMed Google Scholar). Following this initial report, a number of independent groups identified this same protein also called PDZK1 (22Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar) CAP70 (CFTR-associated protein of70 kDa) (23Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), for example. For simplicity, the more generic name PDZK1 will be used here. PDZK1 was shown to interact within the last 15 amino acids of SR-BI (13Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Co-expression of PDZK1 and SR-BI in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in increased selective uptake that was proportional to increased SR-BI protein levels without increased SR-BI mRNA (13Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

(13Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) showed that both PDZK1 and SR-BI co-immunoprecipitated from rat liver, indicating that this interaction occurs in vivo. With this information in mind, the aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the carboxyl terminus PDZ-interacting domain of SR-BI is important for SR-BI function in liver.DISCUSSIONIn this study, the SR-BI PDZK1-interacting domain delimited to the last 3–4 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of SR-BI (EAKL) was shown to be essential for normal SR-BI cell surface expression in liver. SR-BI that was deleted in the last carboxyl-terminal leucine of SR-BI (SR-BIdel509) failed to interact with PDZK1 in vitro but showed normal selective uptake function in 293 cells, in agreement with Connelly et al. (12Connelly M.A. de la Llera-Moya M. Monzo P. Yancey P.G. Drazul D. Stoudt G. Fournier N. Klein S.M. Rothblat G.H. Williams D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5249-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) showing that the carboxyl terminus of SR-BI is expendable for function in vitro. Transgenic mice overexpressing SR-BIdel509 in the liver showed marked accumulation of SR-BI mRNA and a modest increase in protein but no decreases in total plasma cholesterol. Examination of selective uptake and cell surface expression of SR-BI in primary hepatocytes from transgenic mice revealed that SR-BIdel509 protein is not at the plasma membrane.The mechanism by which the SR-BI PDZ-interacting domain EAKL functions to result in SR-BI cell surface localization remains to be determined. One explanation for these findings stems from studies of the basolateral expressed inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir 2.3 in the kidney. It was recently shown that the carboxyl-terminal 4 amino acids of Kir 2.3 comprise a PDZ-interacting domain that interacts with a complex of two PDZ domain proteins, Lin-7 and CASK (29Olsen O. Liu H. Wade J.B. Merot J. Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C183-C195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Kir 2.3 PDZ-interacting domain resulted in retention of Kir 2.3 in a transferrin-containing endosomal compartment, also known as the endosome-recycling compartment, in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (29Olsen O. Liu H. Wade J.B. Merot J. Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C183-C195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Other proteins having mutated PDZ-interacting domains resulting in their mislocalization in the secretory and endosome system are exemplified by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (30Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B., Li, M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), pro-transforming growth factor-α (31Fernandez-Larrea J. Merlos-Suarez A. Urena J.M. Baselga J. Arribas J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 423-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and MT1-MMP (32Urena J.M. Merlos-Suarez A. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 773-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Along these same lines, the lack of interaction of SR-BIdel509 with PDZK1 may have resulted in SR-BI to be mislocalized within the cell. Indeed, SR-BI was recently shown using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy to be localized on both basolateral (sinusoidal) and apical (canalicular) membranes as well as in the endosome recycling compartment in mouse polarized primary hepatocyte couplets (33Silver D.L. Wang N. Xiao X. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25287-25293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The findings that SR-BIdel509 is not localized to the plasma membrane in primary hepatocytes from transgenic mice rule out the possibility that SR-BIdel509 is mislocalized to the apical canalicular membrane. One may therefore speculate that the function of the SR-BI PDZ-interacting domain would be for proper sorting and delivery of SR-BI to the plasma membrane in polarized hepatocytes through interaction with PDZK1 or other PDZ domain proteins. Therefore, disruption of the SR-BI-PDZ interaction might result in SR-BI missorting in the secretory or endosome system that eventually results in its degradation. The immunolocalization of non-PDZK1-interacting SR-BI mutants in liver that are epitope-tagged will need to be examined to test this hypothesis. However, these experiments were precluded here because of a lack of specific antibodies to detect SR-BIdel509. In addition, the residual amount of SR-BIdel509 protein that was detected in transgenic mice (6-fold over endogenous SR-BI) may have resulted from the extremely high level expression (60-fold over endogenous mRNA) achieved from the apoE promoter/liver-specific element used to drive transgene expression. It will also be interesting to determine whether the SR-BI PDZ-interacting domain is essential for cell surface expression of SR-BI in tissues other than liver where SR-BI is expressed (e.g. adrenal gland, ovary, and intestine).The findings presented in this study indicate that the PDZK1-interacting domain of SR-BI is essential for SR-BI cell surface expression in liver, suggesting an important role of PDZK1 or other PDZ domain proteins in reverse cholesterol transport. Ultimately, the role of PDZK1 or other PDZ domain proteins in SR-BI function will have to be determined from PDZK1 knockout mice as well as from the identification of other potential partners in a PDZK1-SR-BI complex.

Biber J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F801-F806PubMed Google Scholar). Following this initial report, a number of independent groups identified this same protein also called PDZK1 (22Kocher O. Comella N. Tognazzi K. Brown L.F. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar) CAP70 (CFTR-associated protein of70 kDa) (23Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), for example. For simplicity, the more generic name PDZK1 will be used here. PDZK1 was shown to interact within the last 15 amino acids of SR-BI (13Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Co-expression of PDZK1 and SR-BI in Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in increased selective uptake that was proportional to increased SR-BI protein levels without increased SR-BI mRNA (13Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), strongly indicating that PDZK1 acts as a scaffolding protein that may decrease SR-BI degradation. Importantly, Ikemoto et al. (13Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) showed that both PDZK1 and SR-BI co-immunoprecipitated from rat liver, indicating that this interaction occurs in vivo. With this information in mind, the aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the carboxyl terminus PDZ-interacting domain of SR-BI is important for SR-BI function in liver. DISCUSSIONIn this study, the SR-BI PDZK1-interacting domain delimited to the last 3–4 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of SR-BI (EAKL) was shown to be essential for normal SR-BI cell surface expression in liver. SR-BI that was deleted in the last carboxyl-terminal leucine of SR-BI (SR-BIdel509) failed to interact with PDZK1 in vitro but showed normal selective uptake function in 293 cells, in agreement with Connelly et al. (12Connelly M.A. de la Llera-Moya M. Monzo P. Yancey P.G. Drazul D. Stoudt G. Fournier N. Klein S.M. Rothblat G.H. Williams D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5249-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) showing that the carboxyl terminus of SR-BI is expendable for function in vitro. Transgenic mice overexpressing SR-BIdel509 in the liver showed marked accumulation of SR-BI mRNA and a modest increase in protein but no decreases in total plasma cholesterol. Examination of selective uptake and cell surface expression of SR-BI in primary hepatocytes from transgenic mice revealed that SR-BIdel509 protein is not at the plasma membrane.The mechanism by which the SR-BI PDZ-interacting domain EAKL functions to result in SR-BI cell surface localization remains to be determined. One explanation for these findings stems from studies of the basolateral expressed inwardly rectifying K+ channel Kir 2.3 in the kidney. It was recently shown that the carboxyl-terminal 4 amino acids of Kir 2.3 comprise a PDZ-interacting domain that interacts with a complex of two PDZ domain proteins, Lin-7 and CASK (29Olsen O. Liu H. Wade J.B. Merot J. Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C183-C195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Kir 2.3 PDZ-interacting domain resulted in retention of Kir 2.3 in a transferrin-containing endosomal compartment, also known as the endosome-recycling compartment, in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (29Olsen O. Liu H. Wade J.B. Merot J. Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C183-C195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Other proteins having mutated PDZ-interacting domains resulting in their mislocalization in the secretory and endosome system are exemplified by cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (30Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B., Li, M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), pro-transforming growth factor-α (31Fernandez-Larrea J. Merlos-Suarez A. Urena J.M. Baselga J. Arribas J. Mol.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 773-784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Along these same lines, the lack of interaction of SR-BIdel509 with PDZK1 may have resulted in SR-BI to be mislocalized within the cell. Indeed, SR-BI was recently shown using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy to be localized on both basolateral (sinusoidal) and apical (canalicular) membranes as well as in the endosome recycling compartment in mouse polarized primary hepatocyte couplets (33Silver D.L. Wang N. Xiao X. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25287-25293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The findings that SR-BIdel509 is not localized to the plasma membrane in primary hepatocytes from transgenic mice rule out the possibility that SR-BIdel509 is mislocalized to the apical canalicular membrane. One may therefore speculate that the function of the SR-BI PDZ-interacting domain would be for proper sorting and delivery of SR-BI to the plasma membrane in polarized hepatocytes through interaction with PDZK1 or other PDZ domain proteins. Therefore, disruption of the SR-BI-PDZ interaction might result in SR-BI missorting in the secretory or endosome system that eventually results in its degradation. The immunolocalization of non-PDZK1-interacting SR-BI mutants in liver that are epitope-tagged will need to be examined to test this hypothesis. However, these experiments were precluded here because of a lack of specific antibodies to detect SR-BIdel509. In addition, the residual amount of SR-BIdel509 protein that was detected in transgenic mice (6-fold over endogenous SR-BI) may have resulted from the extremely high level expression (60-fold over endogenous mRNA) achieved from the apoE promoter/liver-specific element used to drive transgene expression. It will also be interesting to determine whether the SR-BI PDZ-interacting domain is essential for cell surface expression of SR-BI in tissues other than liver where SR-BI is expressed (e.g. adrenal gland, ovary, and intestine).The findings presented in this study indicate that the PDZK1-interacting domain of SR-BI is essential for SR-BI cell surface expression in liver, suggesting an important role of PDZK1 or other PDZ domain proteins in reverse cholesterol transport. Ultimately, the role of PDZK1 or other PDZ domain proteins in SR-BI function will have to be determined from PDZK1 knockout mice as well as from the identification of other potential partners in a PDZK1-SR-BI complex.

We have studied global Ca2+ oscillations arising through activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5a expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and find that these oscillations are largely insensitive to agonist concentration. Using an inducible receptor expression system and a non-competitive antagonist, in conjunction with the translocation of eGFP-PHPLCδ to monitor inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) oscillations in single cells, we show that mGluR5a density determines the frequency of these oscillations. The predominant underlying mechanism resulted from a negative feedback loop whereby protein kinase C (PKC) inhibited InsP3 generation. Down-regulation of PKC by prolonged exposure to phorbol ester revealed a second form of Ca2+i oscillation at low agonist concentrations. These Ca2+i signals showed features typical of classic repetitive Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and were sensitive to agonist concentration. Therefore, a single receptor can stimulate two types of InsP3-mediated Ca2+ signal dependent upon feedback inhibition, producing two distinct means of controlling the final pattern of Ca2+i release. Our results have physiological implications for Ca2+ signaling in general and emphasize the importance of mGluR5 surface expression for modulating synaptic plasticity.

Identifying what modulates the frequency is thus crucial to determining how GPCRs can differentially influence diverse cellular functions. Intuitively, the extent of GPCR activation and consequently the stimulus strength would determine the final frequency. However, for the Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5a, we have found that this is not always the case and, dependent upon what mechanism generates the oscillations, two distinct parameters can define the frequency. Although the intracellular processes that underlie different patterns of Ca2+i signal are complex (2Thomas A.P. Bird G.S. Hajnóczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney J.W.

Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 488-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the proposed mechanisms for Ca2+i oscillations involving InsP3 production following GPCR-mediated activation of phospholipase C (PLC) can generally be classified into two categories (2Thomas A.P.

The best characterized occur at low levels of InsP3 generation as a result of the unusual regulatory properties of Ca2+ at InsP3 receptors; low Ca2+i concentrations increase the open probability of InsP3 receptors and hence promote further Ca2+ release, i.e. Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), but higher Ca2+iconcentrations close the channel (2Thomas A.P.

This manifests itself as oscillations involving Ca2+-induced Ca2+ waves. The second type of oscillation, which we termed dynamic uncoupling or desensitization (9Nash M.S. Young K.W. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), broadly involves feedback inhibition of PLC activity to generate oscillations in InsP3 production that then drive the subsequent Ca2+i oscillations (8Taylor C.W. Thorn P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R352-R355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The mechanisms currently proposed to mediate this process involve either protein kinase C (PKC) feedback inhibition (9Nash M.S. Young K.W. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R.

Bera A.K. Wilkie T.M. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The study of the Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR5, has provided strong evidence for dynamic feedback inhibition involving PKC (13Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 14Kawabata S. Kohara A. Tsutsumi R. Itahana H. Hayashibe S. Yamaguchi T. Okada M. J. Biol.

This receptor induces oscillatory patterns of Ca2+i due to cyclical desensitization/resensitization through PKC phosphorylation of a single site present in the C-terminal tail of the receptor (13Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 14Kawabata S. Kohara A. Tsutsumi R. Itahana H. Hayashibe S. Yamaguchi T. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17381-17385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The direct involvement of classic Ca2+-sensitive PKCs in generating repetitive PLC inhibition has recently been established by studies that showed PKC-dependent InsP3oscillations (9Nash M.S. Young K.W. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and oscillatory PKC translocation (11Codazzi F. Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1089-1097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, we have now found that altering agonist concentration, or using agonists with different efficacies had relatively little effect on the frequency of these oscillations, mirroring earlier findings on PKC-dependent muscarinic receptor-induced Ca2+oscillations in lacrimal acinar cells (16Bird G.S. Rossier M.F. Obie J.F. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8425-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Physiologically it seems unlikely that a GPCR would lose control over such a significant attribute of oscillatory responses, i.e. the ability to modulate the frequency, and it is probable that factors other than agonist concentration are involved. mGluR5-mediated Ca2+i oscillations are driven by PKC phosphorylation of the receptor (13Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 14Kawabata S. Kohara A. Tsutsumi R. Itahana H. Hayashibe S. Yamaguchi T. Okada M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17381-17385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), therefore, this led us to propose that receptor expression levels might influence the frequency. We have addressed this question directly by using two separate approaches: an inducible mGluR5a expression system and titrated amounts of a non-competitive antagonist, and show that receptor density is indeed critical in defining oscillation frequency. Importantly, we also observed agonist concentration-sensitive Ca2+ioscillations in the absence of PKC-feedback inhibition and InsP3 oscillations. This suggests that the extent of PKC regulation determines which of two distinct mechanisms generates the InsP3-induced Ca2+i oscillations. We propose a “sliding-scale” model in which the different modes of Ca2+ signaling are envisaged as a continuum arising from the same basic machinery but dependent upon the degree of feedback control. These two mechanisms use different methods (i.e. agonist versus receptor concentration) to modulate the Ca2+i signal, and so these observations may have important implications for the regulation of mGluR5 function and its role in adaptive responses in the CNS. Vectors containing the fusion constructs between eGFP and the PH domain of PLCδ1, and eGFP and PKCγ were a gift from Professor T. Meyer (Stanford University).

This was cloned into the DsRed2C1 vector (CLONTECH) to produce cytosolic DsRed-InsP3 3-kinase (amino acids 66–459). The kinase-dead version of this construct contains two mutations (D260A and K262A) in the InsP3 binding site (19Togashi S. Takazawa K. Endo T. Erneux C. Onaya T. Biochem.

Standard chemicals and biochemicals were from Sigma (Poole, UK) unless otherwise indicated.

Clones showing minimal receptor expression in the absence of IPTG with robust inducible expression were further tested for quisqualate-induced [3H]InsPs accumulation (see below) to identify the optimal CHO-lac-mGlu5a cell-line. For these studies enhanced receptor expression was achieved by preincubation with IPTG in the presence of 10 mm butyric acid for greater than 20 h (21Nash M.S. Selkirk J.V. Gaymer C.E. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1664-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To minimize the exposure to glutamate, CHO-lac-mGlu5a cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax containing 10% fetal calf serum, proline (44 mg/ml), amphotericin B (2.5 μg/ml), penicillin (105 units/liter), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 300 μg/ml G418. During the induction of receptor expression, cells were maintained in essentially the same culture medium except for the substitution of 10% dialyzed serum and the absence of G418. Saturation binding experiments were performed using [3H]quisqualate to compare mGluR5a receptor densities in CHO-lac-mGlu5a cell membranes, following induction using 10 and 100 μm IPTG using methods as described previously (22Selkirk J.V. Price G.W. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. Neuropharmacology. 2001; 40: 546-656Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In brief, membranes (100 μg of protein) were incubated in 20 mm HEPES, 2 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4, containing glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (1 unit ml−1) and pyruvate (5 mm) in a final volume of 0.5 ml for 45 min at room temperature in the presence of a single, saturating concentration (100 nm) of [3H]quisqualate (specific activity, 25–40 Ci mmol−1). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm quisqualate. Confluent monolayers of CHO cells in 24-multiwell dishes were simultaneously loaded withmyo-[3H]inositol (2.5 μCi/ml) and induced to express receptor for 18–20 h. When necessary, 1 μm phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) was added ∼2 h after initiating induction to down-regulate PKCs. Growth medium was then removed, and the cells were washed with 2 × 1 ml of Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB; 10 mm HEPES, 118 mm NaCl, 4.69 mm KCl, 10 mmglucose, 1.18 mm KH2PO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 1.18 mmMgCl2, and (unless otherwise stated) 1.3 mmCaCl2, pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in an assay buffer (300-μl final volume) of KHB containing glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (3 units/ml) and pyruvate (5 mm) for 20 min before addition of 10 mm LiCl for a further 10 min. For the acute pre-treatments, PDBu was added 5 min after LiCl addition. Quisqualate was then added for the indicated times and the reaction halted by aspiration of the assay buffer and addition of ice-cold 0.5m trichloroacetic acid for 30 min. The accumulated [3H]InsPs were purified by phase separation of aqueous constituents and resolved by Dowex anion-exchange chromatography as outlined in Hermans et al. (23Hermans E. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The real-time visualization of changes in the subcellular distribution of eGFP-PHPLCδ were performed using an Ultraview LCI confocal system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) connected to an Olympus IX-70 microscope with an oil immersion objective (×60). Cells were seeded onto 22-mm coverslips for 8 h and then transiently transfected with 1 μg of eGFP-PHPLCδ plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 (1:3 ratio). Where indicated, cells were similarly transfected with PKCγ-eGFP and on occasion co-transfected with DsRed2-tagged InsP3 3-kinase (1 μg). After ∼20 h the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium containing the required [IPTG], and the cells were incubated for a further 18–20 h. The cells were then washed for at least 30 min in KHB before being placed in a custom-built coverslip chamber on the microscope. The chamber was maintained at 37 °C using a Peltier unit, and cells were perfused with KHB (5 ml/min) using a Gilson Minipuls 2 pump. Confocal images were captured by excitation at 488 nm and accumulating the emitted light for ∼1-s exposure of the digital charge-coupled device camera. Drugs were applied through the perfusion line for the indicated times (generally for 3–4 min). Changes in cytosolic eGFP fluorescence were quantified by taking the ratio of the average signal from a region in the cytosol to the basal level in the same region after subtracting the background reading. For experiments involving dual expression of eGFP- and DsRed2-tagged proteins, cells were excited sequentially at 488 and 568 nm, respectively. Changes in the levels of [Ca2+]i were followed in Fura-2AM-loaded cells using a Nikon Diaphot inverted epifluorescence microscope with an oil immersion objective (×40) and a SpectraMASTER II module (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were grown on 22-mm coverslips and, where stated, transfected for dual imaging as above. For measurement of Ca2+i, Fura-2AM dissolved in 20% pluronic acid was added to 2 ml of KHB (5 μm final concentration), and cells were incubated at room temperature for 1–1.5 h. After washing for at least 30 min cells were transferred to the coverslip holder and mounted on the microscope stage. Sequential images were then captured at wavelengths above 510 nm after excitation at 340 and 380 nm for Ca2+i imaging alone and additionally at 488 nm for eGFP-PHPLCδ and Ca2+iimaging. The Ca2+i signal was expressed as the 340:380 ratio, and changes in cytosolic eGFP fluorescence were as described above. Curve fitting of concentration-dependent data was performed using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA), and half-maximal (EC50) values were determined using the non-linear regression analysis available in the software. Statistical comparisons were made using Student's paired or unpaired t test and ap value of <0.05 was considered significant. The LacSwitch II system (Stratagene) was used to establish heterologous inducible mGluR5a expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells (Fig.1) in a manner similar to that used previously for mGluR1α (20Hermans E. Young K.W. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Nash M.S. Selkirk J.V. Gaymer C.E. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1664-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this system transgene expression is under the control of a Rous sarcoma virus promoter containing three binding sites for the Lac repressor protein. The extent of transcription of the gene of interest can be simply modulated, within each individual cell (21Nash M.S. Selkirk J.V. Gaymer C.E. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1664-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), by varying the concentration of the allosteric inhibitor of the Lac repressor protein isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) (20Hermans E. Young K.W. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Hermans E. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The optimal CHO-lac-mGlu5a clone chosen expressed no detectable receptor protein in the absence of IPTG, indicating near total repression of transcription (Fig. 1 A). When the cells were incubated for 20 h with 100 μm IPTG, significant mGluR5a expression was observed, and this could be titrated by using different concentrations of IPTG (Fig. 1 A). Quantification by densitometric analysis of three separate blots confirmed this finding (Fig. 1 B). Saturation binding analysis using [3H]quisqualate indicated that, at 100 μmIPTG, 186 ± 12 fmol was induced per milligram of protein (approximately 25,000 receptors per cell) and, at 10 μmIPTG, 136 ± 12 fmol/mg of protein was induced. The receptor density induced by the two IPTG concentrations was statistically different (t test, p < 0.05) and equates to an increase of ∼40% between 10 and 100 μmIPTG. The expression of mGluR5a protein was also accompanied by an increase in quisqualate-induced total [3H]inositol phosphates ([3H]InsPs) accumulation in a time (Fig. 1 C)- and concentration (Fig. 1 D)-dependent manner. The mGluR5a-induced increase in InsPs accumulation was markedly attenuated by a 5-min pre-treatment with 1 μm PDBu at all concentrations of quisqualate (Fig. 1 E). This was further tested by incubating overnight with 1 μm PDBu to down-regulate the PKCs, and the effect on quisqualate-induced [3H]InsPs accumulation was determined in control CHO-lac-mGlu5a cells and those acutely treated with PDBu (1 μm) (Fig. 1 F). As anticipated, acute treatment with PDBu attenuated quisqualate-stimulated InsPs accumulation, but importantly this effect was lost in cells chronically treated with PDBu. The increase in the quisqualate response by PDBu treatment overnight likely results from the absence of agonist-stimulated feedback inhibition by PKC, reflecting the dynamic desensitization mechanism discussed below. These data clearly demonstrate the acute sensitivity of mGluR5a to potential agonist-induced feedback regulation by PKC. Oscillatory patterns of Ca2+iresponses were detected in Fura-2AM-loaded CHO-lac-mGlu5a cells pre-treated with 100 μm IPTG and challenged with maximal concentrations of glutamate (100 μm) (Fig.2 A). Similar patterns were observed in response to the mGluR agonists, quisqualate and (1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD) (not shown). Inclusion of the selective mGluR5 non-competitive antagonist; 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), at 500 nm completely abolished the glutamate (100 μm)-induced Ca2+i oscillations (Fig.2 B). These Ca2+i signals were completely dependent upon increases in InsP3 as transient transfection with an eGFP-tagged InsP3 3-kinase to rapidly metabolize InsP3 (18Schell M.J. Erneux C. Irvine R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37537-37546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) dramatically attenuated Ca2+i release compared with sister cells (Fig.2 C). This indicates that there is an absolute prerequisite for increases in [InsP3] in mGluR5a-induced Ca2+i signaling. We have previously shown that oscillations in InsP3 occur concurrently with the Ca2+i oscillations by visualizing repetitive translocation to the cytosol of eGFP-PHPLCδ in Fura-2AM-loaded cells (9Nash M.S. Young K.W. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This “InsP3-biosensor” initially binds to the InsP3 head-group of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdInsP2) but translocates to the cytosol following activation of PLC due to its greater affinity for the soluble form of InsP3 (24Kavran J.M.

J. 2001; 356: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here we show that challenge with 100 μm glutamate similarly induces oscillations in InsP3 levels in the CHO-lac-mGlu5a cells and that these are abolished by an acute pre-treatment with PDBu (Fig. 2 D). Despite convincing evidence to the contrary (25Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 26Nash M.S. Young K.W.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), it has been argued that the eGFP-PHPLCδ probe selectively detects the fall in PtdInsP2 in N1E-115 cells rather than the increase in InsP3 (28van der Wal J. Habets R. Varnai P. Balla T. Jalink K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15337-15344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Because different temporal patterns of PtdInsP2 and InsP3 metabolism may occur (29Willars G.B. McArdle C.A. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which could influence our interpretation of InsP3-controlled Ca2+i release, it was important to confirm “sensing” of InsP3 by the eGFP-PHPLCδ fusion protein. CHO-lac-mGlu1α cells were co-transfected with eGFP-PHPLCδ (0.5 μg of DNA) in combination with either a truncated InsP3 3-kinase or kinase-dead version tagged with DsRed2 (1 μg of DNA). The eGFP-PHPLCδ fusion protein became enriched over the plasma membrane through its association with PtdInsP2, whereas the truncated DsRed2-InsP3 3-kinase, lacking the F-actin binding domain (18Schell M.J. Erneux C. Irvine R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37537-37546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), localized to the cytosol (Fig. 2 E,inset). Cells expressing the kinase-dead protein showed a peak and plateau in eGFP-PHPLCδ translocation to the cytosol following challenge with 100 μm glutamate (Fig.2 E). In contrast, expression of the kinase-active form resulted in little or no translocation of eGFP-PHPLCδ(Fig. 2 E). The mean data from around 60 cells (Fig.2 F) clearly indicate that, in the absence of increases in InsP3, eGFP-PHPLCδ failed to translocate. Experiments testing the effect of co-transfection of CHO-lac-mGlu1α and -mGlu5a cells with full-length InsP3 3-kinase, or vector control, on eGFP-PHPLCδ sub-cellular distribution similarly indicated that increases in InsP3are required to initiate translocation (not shown). These data indicate that, at least for these receptors and this cell system, the translocation of eGFP-PHPLCδ is predominantly a consequence of increases in InsP3 rather depletion of PtdInsP2 levels. Dual imaging of Ca2+i and InsP3 demonstrated not only that both messengers oscillate concurrently but also that they are dependent upon PKC activity, because inclusion of 1 μmstaurosporine converted these oscillations to a peak and elevated plateau response (Fig. 3 A). Following an overnight incubation of cells with 1 μm PDBu to down-regulate PKCs, the oscillatory Ca2+i and InsP3 signals were also converted to a peak and sustained plateau response (Fig. 3 B). This treatment strategy successfully attenuates PKC activity, because, after washing the cells for ∼1 h and then challenging acutely with 1 μm PDBu, no effect on InsP3 production was observed (Fig.3 C), which contrasts with the data in Fig. 2 D for non-PKC down-regulated CHO-lac-mGlu5a cells. The conversion from oscillatory to a sustained InsP3 production following chronic PDBu treatment also provides an explanation of the enhanced quisqualate-induced [3H]InsPs accumulation detected in Fig. 1 F.

Another event (termed γ-like or ε-secretase cleavage) cleaves near residue 721 at ∼2–5 residues inside the cytoplasmic membrane boundary to generate a series of stable, C-terminal APP fragments. This latter cleavage is analogous to S3-cleavage of Notch. We report here that specific mutations in the N terminus, loop, or C terminus of PS1 all increase the production of Aβ42 but cause inhibition of both ε-secretase cleavage of APP and S3-cleavage of Notch. These data support the hypothesis that ε-cleavage of APP and S3-cleavage of Notch are similar events.

One processing event, which is mediated sequentially first by β-secretase and then by γ-secretase, generates several proteolytic fragments, including a 40–42-amino acid fragment termed Aβ and a number of C-terminal fragments (CTFs) that contain the cytoplasmic tail of APP. These CTFs have been variously termed “γ-stubs,” “ε-stubs,” or “APP intracellular domain” (AICD). Detailed analysis of these products has revealed that the cleavage events that give rise to the C terminus of Aβ occur after residues 40 or 42 of the β-secretase stub (Fig. 1). However, those that give rise to the predominant, stable CTFs have an N terminus at residues 49, 50, or 52, which are located 2–5 residues inside the cytoplasmic membrane boundary (1Weidemann A.

Consequently, it has been suggested that PS1 and PS2 mutations have a “gain-of-function” effect on γ-secretase activity. Paradoxically, several of these mutations suppress the ability of human presenilin proteins to complement the Notch signaling phenotype induced by the loss-of-function C60S mutant in Caenorhabditis elegans (11Levitan D. Doyle T. Brousseau D. Lee M. Thinakaran G. Slunt H. Sisodia S. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14940-14944Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 12Baumeister R. Leimer U.

Conversely, the C60S loss-of-function mutation in the sel-12 presenilin homologue, which inhibits Notch processing of C. elegans, causes increased Aβ42 production when introduced into human PS1 as the C92S mutation (13Zhang D.

However, the γ-secretase cleavages of APP near residue 42 (15), the ε-cleavages of APP near residue 50 (1–5), and the S3-cleavage of Notch (7Song W. Nadeau P. Yuan M. Yang X. Shen J.

It has been difficult, therefore, to reconcile the apparently opposing action of pathogenic presenilin mutations on Aβ production in mammalian cells and on Notch cleavage in invertebrates. We now report that, although PS1 mutations augment γ-secretase cleavage at residue 42, they in fact suppress both S3-cleavage of Notch and ε-cleavage of APP near residue 50. These data suggest that γ-secretase cleavage at residue 42 and S3-/ε-cleavage are likely to be independent activities.DISCUSSIONOur data reveal that all three of the pathogenic PS1 mutations tested here differentially affect several presenilin-dependent activities. These three mutations (each in different domains of PS1) cause an increase in the activity of γ-secretase producing Aβ42, whereas simultaneously inhibiting both ε-cleavage of APP and S3-cleavage of Notch. This differential effect of these PS1 mutations provides insight into the complex, regulated, intramembranous proteolysis of type 1 membrane proteins such as APP and Notch. First, our data support the growing body of evidence that suggests that ε-cleavage of APP and S3-cleavage of Notch are likely to be similar, if not identical, proteolytic processing events (1Weidemann A.

This conclusion is entirely compatible with prior data that suggest that FAD-pathogenic mutations have a loss-of-function effect on S3-cleavage of Notch when examined both in vivo inC. elegans and biochemically in vitro(7Song W.

The reduction in S3-cleavage of Notch is modest, which provides an explanation for why FAD-associated mutations in PS1 do not have clinical evidence of embryonic defects in humans, who are usually heterozygous for PS1 mutations, and for why transgenes encoding FAD-linked PS1 mutants are able to rescue the Notch phenotype of PS1−/− mice (27Davis J.A.

Our data are also in accord with previously published data indicating that when the C. elegans sel-12 C60S loss-of-function mutant is expressed in mammalian cells as the human PS1-C92S homologue, it reduced processing of Notch and increased Aβ42 production (13Zhang D. Levitan D., Yu, G. Nishimura M. Chen F. Tandon A. Kawarai T. Arawaka S. Supala A. Song Y. Rogaeva Y. Liang Y. Holmes E. Milman P. Sato C. Zhang L. St George-Hyslop P.

It seems likely that both the γ-secretase and the ε-/S3-cleavage functions are presenilin-dependent. However, it remains unclear whether both ε- and γ-secretase cleavages are necessary for the generation of Aβ, and if so, in which order these cleavage events occur. The fact that an authentic γ-stub (containing residues 43–99) has never been observed has been taken to support the view that ε-cleavage may be the initial and necessary cleavage followed by a carboxyl-exopeptidase degradation back to residue 42. However, our data suggest that these two activities are more likely to be separate events. Indeed, the most parsimonious explanation for our data is that there are two pathways: a physiological pathway mediating ε- and S3-cleavage (to generate signal transduction molecules such as AICD and NICD) and a default pathway that generates Aβ42. These functionally distinct pathways, however, could still be subserved by the same catalytic machinery. Thus, in the absence of the presenilin complex, neither pathway would be active. However, functional modulation of the presenilin complex (for instance, by missense mutations or by post-translational modification of the presenilins themselves) or of other components of the presenilin complex (e.g. glycosylation of nicastrin) might alter the relative balance of γ- and ε-cleavage pathways. We cannot, of course, preclude the alternate possibility that distinct structural components are involved in these two pathways. Our data, in agreement with previously published data, show that although many missense mutations in the substrate for γ-/ε-secretase cleavage (C99-APP) can alter Aβ production, they do not modulate ε-cleavage (1Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 29Lichtenthaler S.F. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15396-15403Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Such observations are compatible with the hypotheses that 1) the molecular mechanisms of substrate:catalysis interactions for Aβ generation and ε-stub/NICD production are different and 2) PS1 mutations might primarily affect a regulatory function rather than directly execute catalytic cleavage.Cumulatively, our data provide the basis for arguing that γ-secretase cleavage, which results in the generation of Aβ42, is functionally distinct from the cleavages necessary for the production of signaling molecules such as AICD and NICD. More work must be undertaken to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these distinct pathways. However, when taken in conjunction with other results, our data raise the possibility of generating compounds that can selectively inhibit Aβ peptide production while minimally affecting AICD or NICD production. The β-amyloid precursor protein (APP)1 undergoes a series of proteolytic processing events (Fig. 1). One processing event, which is mediated sequentially first by β-secretase and then by γ-secretase, generates several proteolytic fragments, including a 40–42-amino acid fragment termed Aβ and a number of C-terminal fragments (CTFs) that contain the cytoplasmic tail of APP. These CTFs have been variously termed “γ-stubs,” “ε-stubs,” or “APP intracellular domain” (AICD). Detailed analysis of these products has revealed that the cleavage events that give rise to the C terminus of Aβ occur after residues 40 or 42 of the β-secretase stub (Fig. 1). However, those that give rise to the predominant, stable CTFs have an N terminus at residues 49, 50, or 52, which are located 2–5 residues inside the cytoplasmic membrane boundary (1Weidemann A.

For the sake of clarity, we retain this terminology. All pathogenic presenilin mutations, which cause familial Alzheimer disease (FAD), enhance the production of the highly amyloidogenic Aβ42 variant (8Scheuner D. Eckman L. Jensen M. Sung X. Citron M.

Consequently, it has been suggested that PS1 and PS2 mutations have a “gain-of-function” effect on γ-secretase activity. Paradoxically, several of these mutations suppress the ability of human presenilin proteins to complement the Notch signaling phenotype induced by the loss-of-function C60S mutant in Caenorhabditis elegans (11Levitan D. Doyle T. Brousseau D. Lee M. Thinakaran G. Slunt H. Sisodia S. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14940-14944Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 12Baumeister R. Leimer U. Zweckbronner I. Jakubek C. Grunberg J. Haass C. Genes Func. 1997; 1: 149Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Conversely, the C60S loss-of-function mutation in the sel-12 presenilin homologue, which inhibits Notch processing of C. elegans, causes increased Aβ42 production when introduced into human PS1 as the C92S mutation (13Zhang D. Levitan D., Yu, G. Nishimura M. Chen F. Tandon A. Kawarai T. Arawaka S. Supala A. Song Y. Rogaeva Y. Liang Y. Holmes E. Milman P. Sato C. Zhang L. St George-Hyslop P.

However, the γ-secretase cleavages of APP near residue 42 (15), the ε-cleavages of APP near residue 50 (1–5), and the S3-cleavage of Notch (7Song W. Nadeau P. Yuan M. Yang X. Shen J.

It has been difficult, therefore, to reconcile the apparently opposing action of pathogenic presenilin mutations on Aβ production in mammalian cells and on Notch cleavage in invertebrates. We now report that, although PS1 mutations augment γ-secretase cleavage at residue 42, they in fact suppress both S3-cleavage of Notch and ε-cleavage of APP near residue 50. These data suggest that γ-secretase cleavage at residue 42 and S3-/ε-cleavage are likely to be independent activities. DISCUSSIONOur data reveal that all three of the pathogenic PS1 mutations tested here differentially affect several presenilin-dependent activities. These three mutations (each in different domains of PS1) cause an increase in the activity of γ-secretase producing Aβ42, whereas simultaneously inhibiting both ε-cleavage of APP and S3-cleavage of Notch. This differential effect of these PS1 mutations provides insight into the complex, regulated, intramembranous proteolysis of type 1 membrane proteins such as APP and Notch. First, our data support the growing body of evidence that suggests that ε-cleavage of APP and S3-cleavage of Notch are likely to be similar, if not identical, proteolytic processing events (1Weidemann A.

Second, our data show that the increase in γ42-cleavage of APP is accompanied by decreases in ε- and S3-cleavage activities. This conclusion is entirely compatible with prior data that suggest that FAD-pathogenic mutations have a loss-of-function effect on S3-cleavage of Notch when examined both in vivo inC. elegans and biochemically in vitro(7Song W.

Haass C. Genes Func. 1997; 1: 149Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The reduction in S3-cleavage of Notch is modest, which provides an explanation for why FAD-associated mutations in PS1 do not have clinical evidence of embryonic defects in humans, who are usually heterozygous for PS1 mutations, and for why transgenes encoding FAD-linked PS1 mutants are able to rescue the Notch phenotype of PS1−/− mice (27Davis J.A.

(We are, however, aware of one case with a compound heterozygote mutation in PS1 (M146V/S365T) in which the affected proband did have several minor congenital malformations (28Rogaeva E.A. Fafel K.C.

Neurology. 2001; 57: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar)). Our data are also in accord with previously published data indicating that when the C. elegans sel-12 C60S loss-of-function mutant is expressed in mammalian cells as the human PS1-C92S homologue, it reduced processing of Notch and increased Aβ42 production (13Zhang D. Levitan D., Yu, G. Nishimura M. Chen F. Tandon A. Kawarai T. Arawaka S. Supala A. Song Y. Rogaeva Y. Liang Y. Holmes E. Milman P. Sato C. Zhang L. St George-Hyslop P.

Finally, the reciprocal relationship between γ42-secretase and the ε-secretase/S3-cleavage suggests that the molecular events leading to the production of Aβ peptide are probably more complex than a single proteolytic cleavage. It seems likely that both the γ-secretase and the ε-/S3-cleavage functions are presenilin-dependent. However, it remains unclear whether both ε- and γ-secretase cleavages are necessary for the generation of Aβ, and if so, in which order these cleavage events occur. The fact that an authentic γ-stub (containing residues 43–99) has never been observed has been taken to support the view that ε-cleavage may be the initial and necessary cleavage followed by a carboxyl-exopeptidase degradation back to residue 42. However, our data suggest that these two activities are more likely to be separate events. Indeed, the most parsimonious explanation for our data is that there are two pathways: a physiological pathway mediating ε- and S3-cleavage (to generate signal transduction molecules such as AICD and NICD) and a default pathway that generates Aβ42. These functionally distinct pathways, however, could still be subserved by the same catalytic machinery. Thus, in the absence of the presenilin complex, neither pathway would be active. However, functional modulation of the presenilin complex (for instance, by missense mutations or by post-translational modification of the presenilins themselves) or of other components of the presenilin complex (e.g. glycosylation of nicastrin) might alter the relative balance of γ- and ε-cleavage pathways. We cannot, of course, preclude the alternate possibility that distinct structural components are involved in these two pathways. Our data, in agreement with previously published data, show that although many missense mutations in the substrate for γ-/ε-secretase cleavage (C99-APP) can alter Aβ production, they do not modulate ε-cleavage (1Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 29Lichtenthaler S.F. Ida N. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15396-15403Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Such observations are compatible with the hypotheses that 1) the molecular mechanisms of substrate:catalysis interactions for Aβ generation and ε-stub/NICD production are different and 2) PS1 mutations might primarily affect a regulatory function rather than directly execute catalytic cleavage. Cumulatively, our data provide the basis for arguing that γ-secretase cleavage, which results in the generation of Aβ42, is functionally distinct from the cleavages necessary for the production of signaling molecules such as AICD and NICD. More work must be undertaken to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these distinct pathways. However, when taken in conjunction with other results, our data raise the possibility of generating compounds that can selectively inhibit Aβ peptide production while minimally affecting AICD or NICD production.

https://openalex.org/W2054094827,"Wnt proteins initiate the canonical (β-catenin-regulated) signaling cascade by binding to seven-transmembrane spanning receptors of the Frizzled (Fz) family together with the coreceptors LRP5 and -6, members of the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein family (LRP). Several reports have shown physical and functional associations between various Wnt, LRP, and Frizzled molecules; however, the underlying mechanisms for selectivity remain poorly understood. We present data on a novel set of Wnt-Fz fusion constructs that are useful for elucidating mechanisms of Wnt signal transduction specificity in both <i>Xenopus</i> embryos and 293T cells. In 293T cells, coexpression of several Wnt-Fz fusion proteins with LRP6, but not LRP5, significantly activated a Wnt-responsive promoter, Optimized TOPFlash. Interestingly, Wnt proteins from both the Wnt1 and Wnt5A classes, when fused to the same Frizzled, can synergize with LRP6 to activate signaling and induce secondary axes in <i>Xenopus</i> embryos. However, when several Wnt-Fz constructs containing different Frizzled molecules were tested, it was found that all Frizzled molecules are not equivalent in their ability to activate the canonical Wnt pathway in this context. The data suggest that the distinction between the two Wnt classes lies not in intrinsic differences in the molecules but via the Frizzled molecules with which they interact."

Whereas LDL oxidation via 12/15-LO may be one potential mechanism for its pro-atherogenic role in mice, we were particularly interested in studying the relationship between this lipoxygenase and cytokine production. To explore further the mechanisms of 12/15-LO pro-atherogenic roles, we have cross-bred 12/15-LO-deficient mice with apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-1 (apobec-1)−/−/LDL-R−/−mice. Apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−mice afford considerable advantage over previous mouse models (15Powell-Braxton L. Veniant M. Latvala R.D. Hirano K.I. Won W.B. Ross J. Dybdal N. Zlot C.H. Young S.G.

Remarkably, we found that 12/15-LO-deficient macrophages have a severe selective defect in IL-12 production that is associated with the attenuation of both IFN consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP) in nuclear extracts and atherosclerotic lesions in 12/15-LO-deficient mice on an apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−background.

PCR products were electrophoresed and transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Specific oligonucleotides internal to the PCR amplification primers were used as probe for hybridization. The sequences of the oligonucleotides are as follows: β-actin, 5′-CCATGTACCCAGGCATTGCTGACAGGATGC-3′; IL-12 p40, 5′-CTGTGACACGCCTGAAGAAGATGACATCAC-3′; and IFN-γ, 5′-CAGCGCTTTAACAGCAGGCCAGACAGCACT-3′. The probe was 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots were pre-hybridized in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) at 42 °C for 1 h, followed by probe hybridization for 4 h.

Monoclonal antibody C17.8 (BD PharMingen) was used as a capture antibody and biotinylated C15.6 (BD PharMingen) as a detecting antibody. RNA was extracted from peritoneal macrophage cultures using Trizol reagent. mRNA levels of IL-12 p40 and MIF, as well as the housekeeping genesL32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were analyzed using BD RiboQuantTM Multiprobe Template Sets (BD PharMingen) and RPA Assay kit (Ambion). Relative levels of mRNA expression were quantified using a PhosphorImager. Data were normalized to the level of L32 detected in each sample as control for variation in sample loading. Nuclear proteins were extracted with NE-PERTM nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). 5 μg of nuclear extract was separated by 12% BisTris-NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions and transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (AmershamBiosciences). The blots were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in TPBS (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. Primary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at the concentration of 0.4 μg/ml in TPBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After washing 3 times in TPBS, the blot was incubated with TPBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1:40,000 dilution of secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences) was used for the visualization of targeted protein. Initial analyses were performed by the Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance test.p < 0.05 was considered significant. Correlations between isoprostane 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI levels and the extent of en face lesions were determined by linear regression analysis. Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad) was used for all calculations.

Cholesterol levels were not significantly different between age- and gender-matched apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/− and apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−/12/15-LO−/− mice (Student's t test). We assessed whether an indirect measure of oxidative stress, urinary isoprostane levels, was diminished as a result of 12/15-LO deficiency in the apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−mouse model. At 8 months, urinary 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI from apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−/12/15-LO−/−male mice (0.88 ± 0.19 ng/mg creatinine, n = 4) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) compared with levels from apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/− mice (1.50 ± 0.06 ng/mg creatinine,n = 3). A similar significant decrement was also observed in female mice (0.58 ± 0.11 ng/mg creatinine,n = 4, versus 1.20 ± 0.16 ng/mg creatinine, n = 3, p < 0.05) (Fig.2 A). Strong correlation of urinary levels of 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI with extent of lesion development was observed (r = 0.87,p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2 B). Based on cytokine assays with 12/15-LO-deficient macrophages (see below), we measured IL-12 levels in mouse aortas. IL-12 p40 levels were significantly (p < 0.0001) lower in 8-month-old apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−/ 12/15-LO−/−mouse aortas (1.0 ± 0.2 ng/mg tissue, n = 4) than in apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−/12/15-LO+/+aortas (3.8 ± 0.1 ng/mg tissue, n = 4) (Fig.3 A). To determine whether the decrease of IL-12 in apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−/12/15-LO−/−mouse aortas was due to decreased mRNA expression in lesions, aortic IL-12 p40 cDNA prepared from 8-month mice of both genotypes was analyzed by RT-PCR and Southern blot hybridization (Fig.3 B). Quantitation of the signals after normalization to β-actin expression indicated a significant decrease in IL-12 p40 levels in apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−/12/15-LO−/−aortas compared with apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−/12/15-LO+/+aortas (0.92 ± 0.11, n = 6, versus1.46 ± 0.08, n = 5, p < 0.005) (Fig. 3 C). IL-12 plays an essential role in the induction of IFN-γ production by Th1 cells, and IFN-γ has been shown to be pro-atherogenic in mice (22Trinchieri G. Blood. 1994; 84: 4008-4027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gupta S. Pablo A.M. Jiang X. Wang N. Tall A.R. Schindler C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2752-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the impact of the reduced IL-12 levels in aortas of 12/15-LO-deficient mice on the IFN-γ levels in the same tissues and found a profound reduction in IFN-γ mRNA levels as well (Fig. 3, B andD). To rule out the possibility that the differences observed in cytokine expression were due to bias in PCR methodology, we performed PCR with titrated cDNA samples and varied cycle numbers. The amount of IL-12 p40 PCR product was always higher in apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−mice than in apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−/12/15-LO−/−mice (data not shown). We sought to explore the relationship of the 12/15-LO pathway with the cytokines that promote Th1-type responses in macrophages. Supernatants from untreated macrophage cultures produced very low levels of IL-12 p40. This production was increased dramatically upon stimulation with LPS (Fig.4 A). Macrophages from 12/15-LO−/− mice produce 75–90% less IL-12 following stimulation with LPS compared with 12/15-LO+/+macrophages (p < 0.001) (Fig. 4 A). This defective induction of IL-12 in 12/15-LO−/−macrophages was also detected in the presence of IFN-γ. Whereas IFN-γ increased the level of LPS-induced IL-12 production, the 12/15-LO−/− macrophages still made 75–90% less IL-12 compared with 12/15-LO+/+ cells (Fig.4 B). To determine whether the defect in IL-12 production in 12/15-LO−/− macrophages was indicative of a general defect in macrophage production of inflammatory mediators, we investigated the capacity of 12/15-LO−/−macrophages to produce TNF-α as well as nitric oxide (NO). 12/15-LO−/− macrophages produced comparable levels of both TNF-α (Fig. 4 C) and NO (data not shown and Ref. 17Sun D. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24055-24062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) suggesting that 12/15-LO may play a specific role in regulating production of IL-12. To investigate further the mechanisms by which 12/15-LO regulates IL-12 production, we performed RPA for IL-12 p40 mRNA transcript in macrophage cultures stimulated with IFN-γ and LPS. Stimulation of 12/15-LO+/+ macrophages with IFN-γ + LPS induced a 3-fold increase of IL-12 p40 mRNA levels above the level detected in untreated cultures. However, the induction of IL-12 p40 by IFN-γ + LPS was dramatically reduced in 12/15-LO−/−macrophages (Fig. 4, D and E(a)). Expression of the macrophage MIF cytokine gene by IFN-γ + LPS was not significantly different between 12/15-LO+/+ and 12/15-LO−/− macrophages (Fig. 4, Dand E(b)) further indicating that 12/15-LO−/− macrophages do not exhibit a general defect in cytokine gene expression. Several soluble factors have been identified that can negatively regulate macrophage IL-12 production including IL-10, prostaglandin E2, and TNF-α (24Hino A. Nariuchi H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25van der Pouw Kraan T.C. Boeije L.C. Smeenk R.J. Wijdenes J. Aarden L.A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 26Ma X. Sun W. Papasavvas E. Riemann H. Robertson S. Marshall J. Bailer R.T. Moore A. Donnelly R.P. Trinchieri G. Montaner L.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1722-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine whether 12/15-LO regulates IL-12 production through one of these or other unidentified soluble factor(s), we performed a series of supernatant transfer experiments. Comparable levels of IL-12 were produced by 12/15-LO−/− macrophages regardless of the presence of fresh media or conditioned media from stimulated macrophages from either 12/15-LO+/+ or 12/15-LO−/− mice. Furthermore, the higher IL-12 levels detected in 12/15-LO+/+ macrophage cultures were not affected by transfer of conditioned media from 12/15-LO−/− cells (Fig.5). Together these data suggest that the regulation of IL-12 by 12/15-LO is not mediated through a stable soluble factor. However, these experiments do not eliminate the possibility that the regulation of IL-12 expression by 12/15-LO may be mediated through a soluble mediator with a short half-life or one that is consumed quickly by the macrophage cultures. To address this question, we also set up co-cultures that contained 50% each of 12/15-LO−/− and 12/15-LO+/+ macrophages. These incubations produced an intermediate level of IL-12 providing further evidence that the nature of the defect in IL-12 production is intrinsic to the metabolism of the 12/15-LO−/− macrophages rather than mediated by production of a soluble transferable mediator (Fig. 5). ICSBP acts as a principal activator of IL-12 p40 transcription in RAW 264.7 cells (27Wang I.M. Contursi C. Masumi A., Ma, X. Trinchieri G. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Together with c-Rel and PU.1, ICSBP has been shown to form a multiprotein complex, which binds to the Ets-2 site (5′-TTTCCT-3′; −210 to −205 for human and −218 to −213 for murine) on the IL-12 p40 promoter. The inhibition of this complex is responsible for the selective decrease of IL-12 p40 in macrophages following Fcγ receptor ligation (28Grazia Cappiello M. Sutterwala F.S. Trinchieri G. Mosser D.M. Ma X. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4498-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To examine further the mechanism involved in the selective decrease of IL-12 p40 in 12/15-LO-deficient macrophages, we performed Western blot analysis of several transcription factors that have been reported to interact with the Ets-2 site on the IL-12 p40 gene promoter. In the nuclei of unstimulated wild type macrophages, minimal levels of Ets-2, ICSBP, IRF-1, and c-Rel were detected. Stimulation of the macrophages with IFN-γ + LPS significantly induced Ets-2, ICSBP, IRF-1, and c-Rel. ICSBP induction was markedly diminished, whereas no obvious changes were observed in Ets-2, IRF-1, and c-Rel in 12/15-LO−/− peritoneal macrophages compared with 12/15-LO+/+ macrophages (Fig.6). Our studies conclusively demonstrate that 12/15-LO gene disruption markedly attenuates atherosclerotic lesion development in 8-month-old apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−mice on a normal chow diet. These observations are consistent with studies performed in apoE−/− mice (9Cyrus T. Witztum J.L. Rader D.J. Tangirala R.K. Fazio S. Linton M.F. Funk C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 10Cyrus T. Praticò D. Zhao L. Witztum J.L. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Funk C.D. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2277-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and LDL-R−/− mice (11Harats D. Shaish A. George J. Mulkins M. Kurihara H. Levkovitz H. Sigal E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 2100-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 12George J. Afek A. Shaish A. Levkovitz H. Cyrus T. Zhao L. Funk C.D. Sigal E. Harats D. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1646-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The apoE-deficient mouse develops typical lesions on a normal chow diet that faithfully mimics human disease progression from monocyte adhesion to foamy macrophages, fatty streaks, and advanced fibrosis (6Reddick R.L. Zhang S.H. Maeda N. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 7Nakashima Y. Plump A.S. Raines E.W. Breslow J.L. Ross R. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 133-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LDL-R-deficient mouse model (8Ishibashi S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Herz J. Burns D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) is also well established but requires a high fat diet to induce elevated LDL cholesterol levels and lesion development. It should be noted that the current model, chow-fed apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−mice, is the most similar to human lipoprotein physiology and is an excellent model for familial hypercholesterolemia. The advantage of the apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−mouse model over the apoE−/− and LDL-R−/− models lies in two points: 1) atherosclerosis in the apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−mouse model is much more pronounced in males than in females, whereas neither apoE−/− nor LDL-R−/− mouse model exhibits the clear gender-based distinction in expression of the disease so evident in humans (men are far more susceptible to atherosclerosis than premenopausal women); 2) familial hypercholesterolemia in humans is characterized by increased LDL cholesterol levels. The apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−mouse model exhibits elevated plasma levels of LDL cholesterol. In the apoE−/− mouse model, the elevated cholesterol is in very low density lipoprotein which is not the case in humans. Thus, a pro-atherogenic role for 12/15-LO is consistently detected in three different atherosclerotic mouse models. In each, a ≈50% decrease in lesion size is observed at varying time points throughout the lifespan of the mice. At early time points (10 and 15 weeks) in apoE−/− mice there is a remarkable lag in lesion initiation (9Cyrus T. Witztum J.L. Rader D.J. Tangirala R.K. Fazio S. Linton M.F. Funk C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 10Cyrus T. Praticò D. Zhao L. Witztum J.L. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Funk C.D. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2277-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the current study, decreased lesions were evident in male apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−12/15-LO−/−aortas at 15 weeks but not in females. The average lesion size in females is always lower than males in this model (15Powell-Braxton L. Veniant M. Latvala R.D. Hirano K.I. Won W.B. Ross J. Dybdal N. Zlot C.H. Young S.G. Davidson N.O. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 934-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and, due to normal variation and limitations of the assay, may have been too early for detection of significant differences in females. Alternatively, hormonal status may be an important factor in early atherogenesis in apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−female mice. The paradoxical results showing that overexpression of 15-LO from the lysozyme promoter in transgenic rabbits decreased aortic lesion formation remains an enigma, potentially indicating strong species differences in the roles of 12/15-LO (29Shen J. Herderick E. Cornhill J.F. Zsigmond E. Kim H.S. Kuhn H. Guevara N.V. Chan L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2201-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In addition to the effects of 12/15-LO gene disruption on IL-12 production, we also observed a decrease of oxidative stress as detected by urinary isoprostane measurement. Isoprostanes are chemically stable prostaglandin isomers that result from oxidative modification of arachidonic acid through a mechanism catalyzed by free radicals (30Lawson J.A. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24441-24444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). They are associated with atherosclerotic lesion development and are regarded as reliable markers of oxidative stress (31Praticò D. Iuliano L. Mauriello A. Spagnoli L. Lawson J.A. Rokach J. Maclouf J. Violi F. FitzGerald G.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2028-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). A strong correlation of urinary 8, 12-iso-iPF2α-VI levels with lesion formation in apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−mice was observed. Despite no significant difference in total cholesterol levels between age- and gender-matched apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−and apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−/12/15-LO−/−mice, disruption of 12/15-LO in the double knockout mice caused a parallel decrease of 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI levels and lesion formation. These results are consistent with our recent report (10Cyrus T. Praticò D. Zhao L. Witztum J.L. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Funk C.D. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2277-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) that 8,12-iso-iPF2α-VI levels decreased in parallel with decreased lesion size in apoE−/−/12/15-LO−/−mice. Although the mechanism involved in this pathway still needs to be investigated, one could speculate that 12/15-LO enzymatic activity on macrophage membranes may initiate a subsequent series of non-enzymatic lipid peroxidations that lead to the formation of isoprostanes in oxidized LDL. We have unveiled a previously unrecognized connection between a lipoxygenase pathway and IL-12 production in macrophages stimulatedin vitro and in a chow-fed mouse model of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in vivo. Lipid-laden monocyte/macrophages are the predominant cell type in atherosclerotic lesions. IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine mainly produced by monocytes/macrophages. The production of IL-12 heterodimer usually depends on the inductive transcription of the p40 subunit; however, pre-formed stores can be mobilized quickly in some cases of parasite infection (22Trinchieri G. Blood. 1994; 84: 4008-4027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Quinones M. Ahuja S.K. Melby P.C. Pate L. Reddick R.L. Ahuja S.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We detected a decreased production of IL-12 that was associated with decreased steady-state IL-12 mRNA levels suggesting that 12/15- LO regulates directly or indirectly with the transcription of the IL-12 p40 gene or the stability of IL-12 p40 mRNA. This reduction in IL-12 production was evident in 12/15-LO-deficient macrophages that were stimulated through the LPS-Toll receptor pathway. IL-12 promotes the generation of Th1 type responses by playing an essential role in the induction of IFN-γ production by Th1 cells. Both IL-12 and IFN-γ are present in human and murine atherosclerotic lesions, and recombinant IL-12 administration accelerates progression of atherosclerotic disease in these mice (2Lee T.S. Yen H.C. Pan C.C. Chau L.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 3Uyemura K. Demer L.L. Castle S.C. Jullien D. Berliner J.A. Gately M.K. Warrier R.R. Pham N. Fogelman A.M. Modlin R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2130-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Furthermore, atherosclerotic lesion area is reduced in IFN-γ receptor null mice (23Gupta S. Pablo A.M. Jiang X. Wang N. Tall A.R. Schindler C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2752-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Together these findings support an active role for Th1 cytokines in modulating atherogenesis in apoE-deficient mice (2Lee T.S. Yen H.C. Pan C.C. Chau L.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 734-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 3Uyemura K. Demer L.L. Castle S.C. Jullien D. Berliner J.A. Gately M.K.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1717-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The decreased IL-12 production in atherosclerotic lesions in turn resulted in a marked reduction of IFN-γ mRNA expression in apobec-1−/−/LDL-R−/−12/15-LO−/−mouse aorta compared with apobec-1−/−/ LDL-R−/−aortas. The lower expression of IFN-γ implies a weaker Th1-mediated immune response at the aortic macrophage level in 12/15-LO−/− mice. A complete block in Th1-mediated responses as a result of 12/15-LO deficiency is not evident because the mice still mount normal responses to infection withListeria monocytogenes and Toxoplasma gondii(17Sun D. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24055-24062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). 2L. Zhao, U. Wille, C. A. Hunter, E. Puré, and C. D. Funk, unpublished data. Taken together, these data suggest that the pro-atherogenic contribution of 12/15-LO may function partly via an effect on the IL-12/IFN-γ pathway. Data from RPA provide evidence that 12/15-LO deficiency may contribute to IL-12 p40 gene down-regulation at the transcription level. Reportedly, IL-12 p40 gene expression is regulated by soluble factors and transcription factors that bind to regulatory elements on the IL-12 p40 promoter including Ets-2, NF-κB, C/EBP, and GA-12 sites (24Hino A. Nariuchi H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 25van der Pouw Kraan T.C. Boeije L.C. Smeenk R.J. Wijdenes J. Aarden L.A. J. Exp.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 2608-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The possibility of IL-12 p40 dysregulation by soluble transferable mediators was ruled out by supernatant transfer and co-culture experiments. Should any of the transcription factors be responsible for the selective IL-12 p40 gene dysregulation in 12/15-LO-deficient macrophages, then it should reveal the following features: 1) functional uniqueness to the IL-12 p40 gene (i.e. responsible for selective alterations for IL-12 p40 gene and not for genes controlling TNF-α and NO synthesis that were unchanged in 12/15-LO-deficient macrophages), and 2) should be induced by LPS and its transcriptional regulatory effect should be enhanced by IFN-γ priming. NF-κB is required for the induction of both TNF-α and inducible NO synthase genes. Furthermore, NF-κB was shown not to account for the selective suppression of IL-12 transcription in macrophages following Fcγ receptor ligation (28Grazia Cappiello M. Sutterwala F.S. Trinchieri G. Mosser D.M. Ma X. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4498-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, although additional experiments will be required to formally exclude a role for NF-κB, we do not consider it likely that NF-κB is a critical factor in regulating the IL-12 p40-selective decrease in 12/15-LO-deficient macrophages. A multiprotein complex that could bind to the Ets-2 site fits the two criteria mentioned above. It has been shown to be responsible for the selective IL-12 down-regulation following Fcγ receptor ligation (28Grazia Cappiello M. Sutterwala F.S. Trinchieri G. Mosser D.M. Ma X. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4498-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and its components, including IRF-1, c-Rel, and ICSBP, are highly induced by either IFN-γ or LPS. Based on the reported difficulties in quantitating protein complexes in primary macrophages (26Ma X. Sun W. Papasavvas E. Riemann H. Robertson S. Marshall J. Bailer R.T. Moore A. Donnelly R.P. Trinchieri G. Montaner L.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1722-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we instead examined the nuclear levels of the individual protein complex components. Markedly attenuated ICSBP nuclear levels were detected in 12/15-LO−/− macrophages in response to IFN-γ + LPS. This observation is in accordance with previous findings (36Scharton-Kersten T. Contursi C. Masumi A. Sher A. Ozato A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) that ICSBP knockout mice display defective IL-12 production. Our data provide evidence that the defect of the ICSBP-containing protein complex correlates with the selective IL-12 defect in LPS + IFN-γ-stimulated 12/15-LO−/− macrophages. The nature of the decreased ICSBP nuclear accumulation in LPS + IFN-γ-stimulated 12/15-LO−/− macrophages remains unknown. Several factors may be responsible for this ICSBP attenuation, and these factors include the following: 1) the products of 12/15-LO, such as 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and 13-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid; 2) an undetermined protein that is down-regulated or functionally deficient in 12/15-LO-disrupted macrophages. The function of this protein may be closely related to the ICSBP nuclear expression; 3) oxidative stress-related factors that influence gene expression, such as reactive oxygen species (37Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2311) Google Scholar, 38Kayanoki Y. Higashiyama S. Suzuki K. Asahi M. Kawata S. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Further study to examine the contribution of these factors on ICSBP attenuation is needed for a complete understanding of the mechanism of IL-12 synthesis defect in 12/15-LO-deficient macrophages."

Here, we found that calpains cleave the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) in vitro, producing fragments that are unable to inhibit caspase-3. These fragments were detected in normal neutrophils but were unstable and rapidly degraded. Calpain inhibition delayed tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis of normal neutrophils, consistent with a role for calpains in regulating the onset of apoptosis. Interestingly, neutrophils from three patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia, a rare syndrome characterized by accumulation of mature neutrophils, exhibited decreased μ-calpain expression, diminished calpain activity, and impaired XIAP degradation. Neutrophils from these patients displayed a delay in spontaneous, Fas-stimulated, and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis. These observations suggest that calpain-mediated XIAP degradation contributes to initiation of apoptosis in normal neutrophils and dysfunction of this regulatory pathway can lead to pathological neutrophil accumulation.

Interestingly, neutrophils from three patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia, a rare syndrome characterized by accumulation of mature neutrophils, exhibited decreased μ-calpain expression, diminished calpain activity, and impaired XIAP degradation. Neutrophils from these patients displayed a delay in spontaneous, Fas-stimulated, and tumor necrosis factor-α-induced apoptosis. These observations suggest that calpain-mediated XIAP degradation contributes to initiation of apoptosis in normal neutrophils and dysfunction of this regulatory pathway can lead to pathological neutrophil accumulation. chronic neutrophilic leukemia inhibitor of apoptosis baculovirus IAP repeat t-butoxycarobonyl-Leu-Met-7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin cycloheximide acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin glutathioneS-transferase reverse transcriptase succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-aminomethylcoumarin tumor necrosis factor-α X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis N-(Nα-benzyloxycarbonyl-Glu-Nε-biotinyl-Lys)-Asp [(2,6-dimethylbenzoyl)oxy] methylketone benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone Normally, the bone marrow produces ∼1011neutrophils/day. These neutrophils have a half-life of only 6–10 h in the circulation and are eventually cleared by constitutive apoptotic programmed cell death (1Savill J.S. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.M. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). In the adult, these rates are precisely balanced. Perturbations of this balance can lead to an increase in neutrophils, as observed in a variety of disorders such as infections, leukemoid reactions, chronic myelogenous leukemia, and chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL)1(2You W. Weisbrot I.M. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1979; 72: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Elliott M.A. Dewald G.W. Tefferi A. Hanson C.A. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that normally render neutrophils so susceptible to apoptosis remain unclear. Caspase-3 plays an important role in neutrophil apoptosis (4Woo M. Hakem R. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Ka¨gi D. Hakem A. McCurrach M. Khoo W. Kaufman S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W.

For example, the caspase-3-mediated cleavage of DNA fragmentation factor 45/inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase is responsible for internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and nuclear morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis (6Liu X.S.

Death receptors such as Fas/APO-1/CD95 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor I trigger mitochondria-independent activation of caspase-8 through the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex containing a death receptor, adapters such as TRADD and FADD/MORT1, and the zymogen procaspase-8 (13Scaffidi C.

With the aid of some of these other polypeptides, cytochromec triggers Apaf-1-dependent activation of caspase-9 (10Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and subsequent activation of a caspase cascade. In some cell types such as hepatocytes, this mitochondrial pathway is also utilized to amplify the death receptor-induced pathways (25Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). In these so-called type II cells (13Scaffidi C. Kirchhoff S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the proapoptotic Bcl-2 homologue Bid is cleaved by caspase-8 to yield a fragment that translocates from cytosol to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where it induces cytochromec release and subsequent caspase-9 activation. The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, which are able to inhibit some effector and initiator caspases, are endogenous apoptotic regulators that are conserved across evolution (26Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). These polypeptides universally contain baculovirus IAP repeats (BIRs). Among IAP family proteins, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP)/MIHA/hILP is the most efficient inhibitor of caspase-3, -7, and -9 (26Deveraux Q.L. Reed J.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). Although various antiapoptotic mechanisms have been reported for XIAP (27Sanna M.G. da Silva Correia J. Ducrey O. Lee J.

The caspase-inhibitory functions of XIAP are subject to multiple regulatory mechanisms. First, upon release from mitochondria, Smac/DIABLO (17Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X.

Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) bind IAP proteins and suppress their ability to inhibit caspases, although a proapoptotic function of Smac independent of IAP binding has also been postulated (29Roberts D.L. Merrison W. MacFarlane M. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Smac/DIABLO is required for apoptosis induced by the death ligand, TRAIL, further supporting a role for IAP family proteins as key regulators of apoptotic cell death (30Deng Y. Lin Y. Wu X. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Second, at high molar excess, caspase-3 and -7 themselves can also overcome XIAP inhibition and cleave XIAP. The resulting N-terminal fragment containing the BIR1 and BIR2 domains has reduced ability to inhibit caspase-3 and -7, whereas the C-terminal fragment containing the BIR3 and RING domains retains the ability to inhibit caspase-9 (31Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). It remains unsettled whether there are other mechanisms that regulate the ability of XIAP to inhibit apoptosis. At the present time, there is relatively little information about the expression of XIAP in neutrophils, the regulation of its levels, and its role in the control of apoptosis. In addition, it has also been unclear whether the status of XIAP is somehow related to the marked susceptibility of neutrophils to apoptosis. In the present study, we found that the constitutive calpain activity in neutrophils (32Knepper-Nicolai B. Savill J. Brown S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30530-30536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) mediates degradation of XIAP. Calpains cleaved XIAP in vitroand in normal neutrophils. Moreover, calpain inhibition impaired the initiation of apoptosis in normal neutrophils. Interestingly, calpain activities were diminished in three patients with CNL, a rare myeloproliferative disorder characterized by marked accumulation of mature neutrophils in the peripheral blood and tissues (2You W. Weisbrot I.M. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1979; 72: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Elliott M.A. Dewald G.W. Tefferi A. Hanson C.A. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The patients' neutrophils exhibited impaired XIAP degradation and diminished apoptosis in response to various stimuli. These results suggest that calpain-mediated XIAP degradation contributes to the physiological regulation of neutrophil turnover, and dysfunction of this regulatory mechanism can lead to marked accumulation of neutrophils. Succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-aminomethylcoumarin (Suc-LLVY-MCA) (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) andt-butoxycarobonyl-Leu-Met-7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin (Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were dissolved in Me2SO at 10 mm and stored at −80 °C.

Apoptotic DNA fragmentation was analyzed by flow cytometric measurement of hypodiploid cells after propidium iodide staining of ethanol-permeabilized cells as previously described (16Hirata H. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Yonehara S. Sawai H. Okazaki T. Yamamoto K. Sasada M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Fluorometric analyses of the cleavage of DEVD-MCA, a caspase-3 substrate, and an affinity labeling of active caspase-3 large subunits with zEK(bio)D-aomk were performed as previously described (5Yamashita K.

Patient 1 was treated with interferon-α and both patients 2 and 3 were treated with hydroxyurea at the time of analyses.

Johnson G.V. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 144: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar). For measuring calpain activity in intact neutrophils, cells were incubated with 20 μm Boc-Leu-Met-CMAC, a membrane-permeant calpain substrate, as described (36Rosser B.G. Gores G.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 144: 245-259PubMed Google Scholar). Release of 7-amino-4- methyl-coumarin was measured using a fluorometric microplate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent; Labsystems) using an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. For analyses of the cleavage of cellular XIAP by recombinant calpains, cytosolic extracts were obtained from Jurkat T cells as described (37Kawabata Y. Hirokawa M. Kitabayashi A. Horiuchi T. Kuroki J. Miura A.B. Blood. 1999; 94: 3523-3530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were suspended in modified STKM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 1 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin) and kept on ice for 40 min, and supernatants were obtained after centrifugation at 20,800 × g for 10 min. Cytosolic extracts were incubated with μ-calpain for 30 min at 37 °C in a reaction volume of 10 μl. To stop the reaction, samples were diluted with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were assayed for XIAP cleavage by immunoblotting. Total cellular RNA was isolated from neutrophils using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ RNA was selected by the Micro-oligo(dT) Cellular Spin Column kit (5 Prime 3 Prime, Boulder, CO) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using a random primer. Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) with a high proofreading ability was used in the polymerase chain reactions to avoid artifactual introduction of mutations. The primers used were as follows: XIAP forward, 5′-GGTGGACAAGTCCTATTTTC-3′; XIAP reverse, 5′-CCTACTTGGTAGCAAATGC-3′; caspase-3 forward, 5′-AGGCCGTGAGGAGTTAGCGA-3′; caspase-3 reverse, 5′-TGAGCCTTTGACCATGCCCACAGA-3′. Direct sequencing of RT-PCR products was performed using ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Bone marrow aspirates from all three CNL patients showed myeloid hyperplasia without myelodysplasia (38Reilly J.T. Br. J. Haematol. 2002; 116: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), a normal karyotype, and no evidence of bcr/abltranslocation on fluorescence in situ hybridization and RT-PCR analyses. Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase scores and serum vitamin B12 were elevated (38Reilly J.T. Br. J. Haematol. 2002; 116: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Serum immunoelectrophoresis analyses were negative for monoclonal immunoglobulin (38Reilly J.T. Br. J. Haematol. 2002; 116: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Serum levels of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were normal in all cases. A provisional diagnosis of CNL was made in each case after evaluation for infectious, rheumatologic, and malignant causes of the leukocytosis was negative (2You W. Weisbrot I.M. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1979; 72: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Patient 1 was a 65-year-old woman admitted to the hospital with a 1-month history of weakness and dizziness. A complete blood count was as follows: white blood cells, 116 × 109/liter (85% segmented neutrophils, 9% bands, 1% lymphocytes, and 2% monocytes); hemoglobin, 13.1 g/dl; platelets, 100 × 109/liter. Treatment with hydroxyurea and interferon-α failed to suppress her white blood cell count. Combination chemotherapy using 6-mercaptopurine, busulfan, and etoposide resulted in a decrease in white blood cell counts below 10 × 109/liter. However, the response was transient and the platelet counts fell below 10 × 109/liter, requiring repeated platelet transfusions. She suffered from progressive neutrophilia despite chemotherapy and died of cerebral hemorrhage 1 year after admission. Patient 2 was a 61-year-old man with neutrophilic leukocytosis and splenomegaly admitted to the hospital because of poor compliance with hydroxyurea therapy. Laboratory values on admission were as follows: white blood cells, 74.5 × 109/liter (59.2% segmented neutrophils, 21.6% bands, 3.4% lymphocytes, and 3.2% monocytes, 2.2% metamyelocytes, 7.4% myelocytes, 1.8% promyelocytes, and 0.2% blasts); hemoglobin, 6.7 g/dl; platelets, 73 × 109/liter. After hydroxyurea was adjusted to 500 mg every other day, he was discharged and followed with white blood cell counts from 40 to 75 × 109/liter. Patient 3 was a 68-year-old man referred to the outpatient clinic because of neutrophilic leukocytosis (28 × 109/liter). His white blood cell count remained stable around 30 × 109/liter with continuous administration of hydroxyurea. The complete blood count at the time of experiments was as follows: white blood cells, 34.7 × 109/liter (86.5% neutrophils, 1% eosinophils, 0.9% basophils, 6.6% lymphocytes, and 5% monocytes); hemoglobin, 8.3 g/dl; platelets, 11 × 109/liter. Immunoblotting revealed that XIAP protein is expressed in normal neutrophils (Fig.1A, upper lane 1). Recent detailed elucidation of TNF-induced apoptotic signaling in neutrophils (5Yamashita K. Takahashi A. Kobayashi S. Hirata H. Mesner P.W., Jr. Kaufmann S.H. Yonehara S. Yamamoto K. Uchiyama T. Sasada M. Blood. 1999; 93: 674-685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the role of XIAP in this process. After treatment with TNF/CHX, XIAP was markedly decreased in normal neutrophils within 3 h (upper lanes 2 and3), as shown in Fig. 1A for one of 10 controls that behaved identically. A decrease in XIAP was also observed in cells undergoing spontaneous apoptosis (Fig. 1B, upper lanes 3 and 4), indicating that neither TNF nor CHX is required for the diminution in XIAP. CHX treatment alone induced a minimal increase in the rate of XIAP degradation (Fig. 1B, compare upper lanes 2 and 3 with upper lanes 5 and 6), indicating that the quick XIAP degradation within 3 h shown in Fig. 1A requires combination with TNF. A previous study has reported that spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis can be suppressed by inhibition of both the proteasome and calpains (32Knepper-Nicolai B. Savill J. Brown S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30530-30536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), cytoplasmic calcium-activated cysteine proteases (39Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In further experiments, we examined the effects of inhibitors of these proteases. The spontaneous apoptosis-associated decrease in XIAP in normal neutrophils was blocked by the combination of calpeptin, an inhibitor of calpains, and lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor (Fig.1C, upper lane 5). In contrast, calpeptin alone was sufficient for significant inhibition of XIAP degradation during TNF/CHX-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1D, upper lane 3), and lactacystin exhibited minimal inhibitory effects on this process (Fig. 1D, upper lanes 4 and5). In addition, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk), which is commonly used as a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, decreased TNF/CHX-induced XIAP degradation. Further studies using purified enzymes confirmed a previous report (40Wolf B.B. Goldstein J.C. Stennicke H.R. Beere H. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Blood. 1999; 94: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that zVAD-fmk can inhibit proteolytic activity of μ-calpain as well as that of caspase-3 (Fig.2B) but failed to provide any evidence that calpeptin inhibits caspase-3 at 100 μmin vitro (Fig. 2A). Based on these results, the inhibitor profiles shown in Fig. 1, B–D suggest that calpains plus the proteasome contribute to XIAP degradation in spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis, whereas calpains alone appear to play a significant role in TNF/CHX-treated neutrophils. To assess whether this calpain-dependent protein cleavage was unique to XIAP, neutrophils were treated with TNF/CHX and examined for levels of other apoptotic regulators. In particular, calpains have previously been shown to cleave Bcl-2 (41Gil-Parrado S. Fernandez-Montalvan A. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Popp O. Bestvater F. Holloschi A. Knoch T.A. Auerswald E.A. Welsh K.

https://openalex.org/W2015157179,"The serine/threonine protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in the regulation of drug resistance and cell survival in many types of cancer cells. However, the one or more precise mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we have identified and determined the mechanism by which PKC-ε, a novel PKC isoform, modulates drug resistance in lung cancer cells. Western blot analysis demonstrates that expression of PKC-ε, but not other PKC isoforms, is associated with the chemo-resistant phenotype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Northern blotting and nuclear run-on transcription analysis further reveals that the failure of expression of PKC-ε in the chemo-sensitive phenotype of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells results from transcriptional inactivation of the gene. Importantly, forced expression of PKC-ε in NCI-H82 human SCLC cells confers a significant resistance to the chemotherapeutic drugs, etoposide and doxorubicin. Resistance is characterized by a significant reduction in apoptosis in PKC-ε-expressing cells. Treatment of NCI-H82 cells with etoposide induces a series of time-dependent events, including the release of cytochromec from the mitochondria to the cytosol, activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). All of these events are blocked by PKC-ε expression. Furthermore, caspase-specific inhibitors, z-VAD-fmk and z-DEVD-fmk, significantly attenuate the accumulation of sub-G1population and block the PARP cleavage in response to etoposide. These results suggest that PKC-ε prevents cells from undergoing apoptosis through inhibition of the mitochondrial-dependent caspase activation, thereby leading to cell survival. Finally, down-regulation of PKC-ε expression by the antisense cDNA in NSCLC cells results in increased sensitivity to etoposide.

Human lung cancer is a disease of heterogeneous histology which can be divided into two major categories; small cell lung cancer (SCLC) 1The abbreviations used are: SCLC, small cell lung cancer; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; PKC, protein kinase C; DAG, diacylglycerol; z-DEVD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp(OMe) fluoromethyl ketone; z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe) fluoromethyl ketone; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; CMV, cytomegalovirus; COX, cytochrome c oxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; pNA, p-nitroanilide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; z-IETD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(ome)-Thr-Asp(ome)-fluoromethyl ketone. 1The abbreviations used are: SCLC, small cell lung cancer; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancer; PKC, protein kinase C; DAG, diacylglycerol; z-DEVD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp(OMe) fluoromethyl ketone; z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe) fluoromethyl ketone; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; CMV, cytomegalovirus; COX, cytochrome c oxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; pNA, p-nitroanilide; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; z-IETD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(ome)-Thr-Asp(ome)-fluoromethyl ketone. and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC represents ∼25% of all lung cancer and is characterized by a marked initial response to chemotherapy and radiation. However, nearly all patients with SCLC relapse and develop resistance to cytotoxic therapy and eventually die from the disease. Overall, the 5-year survival rate is only 3–8% (1Facchini F.M. Spiro S.G. Brambilla C. Brambilla E. Lung Tumors. Marcel Dekker, New York1999: 611-630Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism of developing drug resistance in relapsed SCLC patients is unclear. Studies have suggested that tumor cells that survive chemotherapy display phenotypes distinctly different from those expressed by the primary tumor prior to chemotherapy (2Abeloff M.D. Eggleston J.C. Mendelsohn G. Ettinger D.S. Baylin S.B. Am. J. Med. 1979; 66: 757-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is clear that understanding the molecular determinants of chemo-resistance in SCLC upon relapse will lead to more efficient therapy. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a highly specific and regulated process that plays an important role in the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms as well as tumorigenesis (3Vaux D.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 245-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 4Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar). There is an increasing body of evidence that the control of apoptosis is disrupted in many tumor cells. The dysregulated apoptosis is thought to contribute to enhanced tumor progression and metastasis. Furthermore, it has become evident that resistance to apoptosis is one potential mechanism whereby tumor cells escape from chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity, leading to cell survival (5Hannun Y.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 1845-1853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Development of chemo-resistance in tumor cells may, therefore, be due to their selective defects in the intracellular signaling proteins central to apoptotic pathways. These defects may provide a selective advantage for the tumor cells thereby rendering them resistant to chemotherapy. Recent studies have defined a number of key molecules that are critical in apoptotic process. These include the Bcl-2 family of proteins and a family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases named caspases. The Bcl-2 family proteins play a critical role in regulation of mitochondria function during apoptosis (6Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar, 7Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Members of the Bcl-2 family can have both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities. The interactions between the different Bcl-2 family members play an important role in determining cell fate during apoptosis. Caspases are the central engines of the apoptotic process, which are synthesized as latent zymogens and are activated by proteolytic cleavage (8Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X-D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). There are currently two well characterized caspase-activating cascades that regulate apoptosis: one is mediated by cell surface death receptors, and the other is regulated by the mitochondria. In the death receptor pathway, death receptor ligation promotes clustering and activation of caspase-8 and -10, which in turn activate downstream caspases. By contrast, caspase activation via the mitochondrial pathway involves mitochondrial integration of apoptotic signals and subsequent release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. Once released from the mitochondria, cytochrome c initiates formation of a complex (apoptosome) with procaspase-9 and an adaptor molecule, apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) thereby activating caspase-9, which in turn activates downstream caspases such as caspase-3, -6, and -7. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of at least 11 structurally related serine/threonine protein kinases that play crucial roles in transducing signals that regulate diversified biological functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (9Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2346) Google Scholar, 10Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). The PKC family can be divided into three subgroups based on differences in their structures and biochemical properties: the classic isoforms (PKC-α, βI, βII, and γ), which are Ca2+ and phorbol ester/diacylglycerol (DAG)-dependent; the novel isoforms (PKC-δ, ε, η, θ, and μ), which are phorbol ester/DAG-dependent but Ca2+-independent; and the atypical isoforms (PKC-ζ and ι/λ), which are Ca2+- and phorbol ester/DAG-independent. The heterogeneous expression profiles of each PKC isoform in tissues strongly suggest that each isoform has a unique individual role. Their different subcellular localization and isoform-specific cofactor and activator requirements indicate each isoform is regulated differently (10Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 11Jaken S. Parker P.J. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Recent studies using strategies to explore the isoform-specific functions of PKC suggest that specific PKC isoforms may be either anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic, which is likely dependent on the nature of the apoptotic stimuli and the specific cell types involved (12Hofmann J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 142: 1-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKC isoforms that appear to be anti-apoptotic include PKC-α, PKC-βII, PKC-ε, and the atypical isoforms PKC-λ/ι and PKC-ζ (13Whelan D.H.R. Parker P.J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1939-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 14Barr L.F. Campbell S.E. Baylin S. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 381-392PubMed Google Scholar, 15Murray N.R. Fields A.P. J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, PKC-δ has been shown as a common intermediate in the apoptotic pathway (17Fujii T. Garcı́a-Bermejo M.L. Bernabó J.L. Caamaño J. Ohba M. Kuroki T., Li, L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 18Reyland M.E.

However, the precise biochemical mechanisms by which PKC regulates anti-apoptotic effects remain elusive. Human lung cancer cells express multiple PKC isoforms. It has been reported that the drug-resistant phenotype is associated with expression and/or activity of PKCs in lung cancer cell lines and lung carcinomas (19Basu A. Weixel K. Saijo N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1507-1512PubMed Google Scholar, 20Volm M. Pommerenke E.W. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 463-466PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unclear what role(s), if any, a specific PKC isoform may play in this process. In this study, we identify and determine the function of the PKC-ε isoform in lung cancer cells. Using isoform-specific antibodies, we demonstrate that PKC-ε, but not other PKC isoforms, is specifically linked to the chemo-resistant phenotype of the NSCLC cell lines and its induction in SCLC cells confers resistance to chemotherapy. Evidence presented in this study suggests that the chemo-protective effect of PKC-ε is mediated by the inhibition of drug-induced caspase activation through dysregulation of one or more of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, thereby leading to cell survival. These observations demonstrate a functional role for PKC-ε in the regulation of survival of lung cancer cells and provide potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention to overcome drug resistance. Human PKC-ε cDNA was obtained from Dr. A. P. Fields (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX). The human PKC-ε cDNA was tagged with a FLAG epitope at its N terminus and subcloned into expression vector pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI). The plasmid that expresses the antisense PKC-ε cDNA was constructed by subcloning the human full-length PKC-ε cDNA into pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in an antisense orientation. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to specific PKC isoforms were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Antibodies against cleaved and full-length versions of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Rabbit anti-PARP and goat anti-actin polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Anti-cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12) and anti-cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit IV (clone 20E8) were from BD PharMingen and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), respectively. Caspase inhibitors (z-VAD-fmk and z-DEVD-fmk) were purchased from Enzyme System Products (Livemore, CA). Etoposide and doxorubicin were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). G418 sulfate (Geneticin) and LipofectAMINE were from Invitrogen (Rockville, MD). Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). [α-32P]dCTP and [α-32P]CTP were from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ). Human lung cancer cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 9% (v/v) calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Stable transfection of NCI-H82 cells was carried out using an electroporation method. Transfected cells were selected for G418 resistance. Clonal populations that express the FLAG-tagged PKC-ε were generated and maintained in the culture medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. Stable transfection of NCI-H157 with an antisense PKC-ε cDNA was carried out using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's recommendation. 48-h post-transfection, cells were selected for G418-resistance. A pool of G418-resistant clones was used for clonogenic survival assays. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the acid phenol-guanidine isothiocyanate method (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62897) Google Scholar). 20 μg of RNA was fractionated on a denaturing 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde (2.1 m), transferred to a GeneScreen membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA), and hybridized with 32P-labeled human PKC-ε cDNA probe in ULTRAhyb hybridization buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX). The same membrane was then stripped and re-probed with human β-actin cDNA for loading control. Nuclear run-on transcription assays were carried out as described previously (22Xiao L. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled nascent RNA transcripts purified from nuclei of representative cell lines were used to hybridize with the immobilized cDNA on Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After high stringency washes, membranes were subjected to autoradiography. Soft agar assays were carried out in six-well plates as described by Clark et al.(23Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 295-412Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 0.3% agarose in growth medium overlaid on a base of 0.6% agarose. Cultures were fed weekly. Colonies were scored 21 days later after plating. For growth curves, 5 × 104 cells per well were plated in six-well plates in complete medium. Media were changed every 2 days. Cell numbers were determined by trypan blue exclusion. Triplicate cultures of each cell clone were prepared and processed in all experiments. Cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were cultured in six-well plates in the presence of either etoposide or doxorubicin at indicated concentrations for 96 h. Control cells were treated with the vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion and presented as the ratio of viable cell numbers in drug-treated cultures relative to that in Me2SO-treated controls times 100. Clonogenic assays were performed by plating cells (5000 cells/well) in six-well plates, treating with etoposide or vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) for 48 h. Cells were then cultured in drug-free media for 12 days and stained with 0.5 mg/ml crystal violet in 20% methanol. Drug-resistant colonies were scored, and cloning efficiency was expressed as a ratio of the number of colonies formed in the antisense-transfected cells to that in the vector-transfected cells times 100. All treatments were performed in triplicate. Control or treated cells were collected and stained by incubating in a staining solution of 100 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and 20 μg/ml propidium iodide in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C for 15 min in dark. Stained cells were viewed under the Zeiss Axioplan-2 fluorescence microscope with the appropriate filters to simultaneously visualize the blue fluorescence from Hoechst 33342 and the red fluorescence from propidium iodide. Apoptotic cells were defined by condensed and/or fragmented chromatin of blue fluorescence-emitting nuclei. To quantify apoptotic cells, a least 500 cells per preparation were scored for the incidence of apoptotic chromatin changes. Results are expressed as a ratio of apoptotic cells to the total number of blue nuclei examined times 100. Flow cytometry analysis was used to determine the sub-G1populations of etoposide-treated cells. Cells were fixed in 90% methanol, treated with RNase A (100 μg/ml) at 4 °C for at least 4 h, and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS on ice for 15 min. DNA contents were assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a FACSort (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA). A total of 50,000 cells was analyzed in every event. Data were evaluated using CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson) and represent the average of three measurements. Cells (1 × 106) were harvested and lysed in a buffer of 500 mm Tris·Cl (pH 9.0), 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl supplemented with proteinase K (1 mg/ml) and 1% SDS at 37 °C overnight. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v), followed by ethanol precipitation. DNA was recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 30 min and dissolved in LTE buffer (3 mmTris·Cl (pH 8.0) and 0.3 mm EDTA) containing 500 μg/ml RNase A. 20 μg of DNA per sample was digested with RNase A at 37 °C for 1 h and separated on a 1.8% agarose gel. DNA fragmentation was examined under UV lights after ethidium bromide staining and photographed. Caspase-3 activity was assessed using a Caspase-3 Cellular Activity Assay Kit (Calbiochem) according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were resuspended and incubated at 5 × 107 cells/ml in a lysis buffer of 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were cleared at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Caspase-3 activity was measured in the supernatant using colorimetric Ac-DEVD-pNA as a substrate. The cleavage of the substrate was determined using a kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) at a wavelength of 405 nm. Caspase-3 activity was calculated according to the slope of theA 405 versus time plot from linear regression analysis. Data were expressed as picomoles of the colorimetric substrate pNA liberated per minute and microgram of protein. Cells were treated with etoposide or Me2SO for 96 h and harvested by centrifugation at 900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in buffer A (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. After 10-min incubation on ice, cells were homogenized using a Dounce tissue grinder. Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to discard unbroken cells and nuclei. Supernatants were subjected to additional centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellets (rich in mitochondria) were resuspended in buffer A and designated as the heavy-membrane fraction. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 150,000 × gfor 90 min at 4 °C and collected as the cytosolic fraction. Whole cell lysates were prepared in a modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described previously (24Xiao L. Lang W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 400-408PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of lysates were resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Protein expression was determined by immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies as described previously (24Xiao L. Lang W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 400-408PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). All data are presented as means ± S.D. Differences in anchorage-independent colony formation and effects of caspase inhibitors on the sub-G1 accumulation were examined using Student's t test. SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was used to perform statistical analyses. The difference was considered to be statistically significant if the p value was <0.05. The underlying mechanism of developing drug resistance in relapsed SCLC patients is unclear. This resistance may be due, in part, to a transition of the SCLC toward the NSCLC histology (2Abeloff M.D. Eggleston J.C. Mendelsohn G. Ettinger D.S. Baylin S.B. Am. J. Med. 1979; 66: 757-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25Mabry M. Nelkin B.D. Falco J.P. Barr L. Baylin S. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 53-58PubMed Google Scholar), which shows poor response rates to chemotherapy. Furthermore, it has been reported that the drug-resistant phenotype is associated with expression and/or activity of PKCs in lung cancer cell lines and lung carcinomas (19Basu A. Weixel K. Saijo N. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1507-1512PubMed Google Scholar, 20Volm M. Pommerenke E.W. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 463-466PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, expression profiling of PKC isoforms was determined by Western blot analysis using isoform-specific antibodies in a panel of human lung cancer cell lines, which includes eight NSCLC lines and four SCLC lines. As shown in Fig.1 A, a striking differential expression pattern for the PKC-ε isoform was observed between the NSCLC and SCLC phenotypes: its expression was detected in all of the NSCLC lines but none of the SCLC lines. Expression of other PKC isoforms (α, βI, βII, γ, δ, η, and θ) shows no specific association to either phenotype, and expression of PKC-ζ and -ι isoforms was undetectable (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). Furthermore, NCI-H82 SCLC cells, when phenotypically transformed to the NSCLC-like phenotype by oncogenic Ras, express PKC-ε (Fig.1 A, H82+RasV12 lanes) (24Xiao L. Lang W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 400-408PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that PKC-ε expression is associated with the NSCLC-phenotype in lung cancer cells. Expression of PKC-ε was further examined at levels of steady-state mRNA and gene transcription to determine the molecular basis of the phenotype-specific expression. Northern Blot analysis (Fig. 1 B or data not shown) demonstrates that the lack of PKC-ε protein expression in SCLC cell lines is associated with a deficiency in the expression of steady-state PKC-ε mRNA in these cells. Undetectable expression of PKC-ε mRNA in SCLC cells may be due to changes in the message half-life or transcription of the gene. To distinguish between these two possibilities, nuclear run-on transcription experiments were performed to determine the transcription rate for the PKC-ε gene. As shown in Fig. 1 C, PKC-ε gene transcription was undetectable in SCLC lines (H82 and H69), whereas NSCLC lines (H23 and H157) were capable of transcribing the gene. It appears that in SCLC cells the PKC-ε gene is transcriptionally inactive. Together, these data suggest that the phenotype-specific expression of PKC-ε is controlled primarily at the level of gene transcription. It has been reported that the Myc/Ras-mediated phenotypic transition of SCLC toward NSCLC-like phenotype is associated with an acquired resistance to 2-difluoromethylornithine (25Mabry M. Nelkin B.D. Falco J.P. Barr L. Baylin S. Cancer Cells. 1991; 3: 53-58PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we have found that induction of PKC-ε expression in Ras-transformed NCI-H82 SCLC cells is correlated with altered drug sensitivity toN 1,N 12-bis(ethyl)spermine, an anti-cancer polyamine analogue. 2L. Xiao, K.-M. Bae, and H.-M. Wang, unpublished observations. These data suggest that phenotype-specific expression of PKC-ε may be important for cellular response to drug treatment. To explore the functional significance of PKC-ε expression on chemo-sensitivity, NCI-H82 (H82) human SCLC cells that do not express endogenous PKC-ε (Fig. 1) were stably transfected with an expression plasmid encoding the FLAG epitope-tagged full-length human PKC-ε. Several G418-resistant clones were isolated and expanded, in which PKC-ε expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-PKC-ε antibody (Fig.2 A). Three PKC-ε-expressing clonal cell lines (1, 7, and 12) were used in this study. As a control, a pool of G418-resistant clones from the empty vector-transfected NCI-H82 cells was generated and designated as H82-Vector. Compared with the control (H82-Vector) cells, PKC-ε-expressing clonal cell lines displayed very similar growth kinetics in complete medium (Fig.2 B) but showed an increased ability to grow on soft agar (Table I). Differences in the anchorage-independent colony formation between PKC-ε-expressing cells and H82-Vector cells were statistically significant (pvalues were 0.0034, 0.0004, and 0.014 for PKC-ε clones #1, #7, and #12, respectively, compared with H82-Vector). It should be noted that forced expression of PKC-ε did not result in an alteration of expression levels of other PKC isoforms and had no significant effect on cell cycle progression (Fig. 2 A and data not shown).Table IEffects of PKC-ε expression on cell growth and drug sensitivityCell lineGrowth on soft agaraNumbers of colonies formed on 0.3% agar per 5000 cells plated.

Its gene on chromosome 5q12 encodes 5 splice variants, which show tissue-dependent expression and regulation. The genomic arrangement of PDE4D was determined usingin silico methods, and a putative promoter of one of the protein kinase A-activated, long isoforms, PDE4D5 was identified.

Compartmentalized intracellular cAMP gradients are governed by a balance between its generation from ATP by the action of adenylyl cyclases and the rate of degradation. In contrast to the diverse stimuli responsible for production of cAMP (3Smit M.J. Iyengar R. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1998; 32: 1-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), members of the multigenic phosphodiesterase (PDE)1 family provide the sole means of degradation by catalyzing its hydrolysis to 5′-AMP. At present the PDE superfamily is known to consist of 11 separate families classified according to substrate selectivity, inhibitor sensitivity, and sequence (4Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar, 5Soderling S.H. Beavo J.A. Curr Opin Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 6Manganiello V.C. J.

Those involved in the hydrolysis of cAMP include PDE 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, and 11 (9) The expression of these families demonstrate tissue-specific patterns with multiple family members usually being present in each tissue type. Tissue profiling of human airway smooth muscle cells has revealed the expression of the majority of PDE families. However, functional studies indicate that PDE 3 and 4 essentially co-regulate cAMP levels in this tissue type and are, therefore, important mediators of bronchial tone (10Torphy T.J. Undem B.J.

The rolipram inhibited PDE4 family has received most attention as a therapeutic target in airways disease. It provides the dominant phosphodiesterase activity in inflammatory cells such as neutrophils, eosinophils, and CD4+ lymphocytes, which are thought to be central to the pathogenesis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (12Torphy T.J.

Cell Genet. 1995; 69: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning of these genes has revealed a further level of complexity due to the presence of multiple splice variants. In the case of PDE4D, for example, there are 5 splice variations at the 5′-end of the gene, which give rise to 3 long, 1 short, and 1 supershort isoform (7Bolger G.B. Cell Signal. 1994; 6: 851-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 27Conti M. Nemoz G. Sette C. Vicini E. Endocr.

There is an increasing body of evidence demonstrating functional differences between the isoforms. For example, differential effects of phosphorylation in the so-called Upstream Conserved Regions (UCRs) of PDE4D appear to confer isoform-specific functional regulation. Investigators have shown that phosphorylation of the serine 54 residue in UCR1 of the long isoforms by protein kinase A produces a 2–3-fold increase in the V max of the isoform (29Alvarez R. Sette C. Yang D. Eglen R.M. Wilhelm R. Shelton E.R. Conti M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 616-622PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol.

ERK phosphorylation of the catalytic region also appears to have different effects depending on the UCRs present: the UCR1-UCR2 module present in the long isoforms directs inhibition, whereas the lone UCR2 of the short isoform directs activation, and the truncated UCR2 of the supershort isoform allows no effect on enzymatic activity of ERK phosphorylation (33Baillie G.S. MacKenzie S.J. McPhee I. Houslay M.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 34MacKenzie S.J. Baillie G.S. McPhee I. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. J. Biol.

In addition to these regulatory differences between the isoforms, their distinct, cell type-specific patterns of intracellular distribution further strengthen the case for diverse functional roles (4Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar, 6Manganiello V.C. J. Mol.

Each PDE4 isoform is characterized by its unique N-terminal region, which appears to play a key role in intracellular targeting (9Houslay M.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 69: 249-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the N-terminal region of PDE4D5 confers interaction with the signaling scaffold protein RACK1 (37Yarwood S.J. Steele M.R.

These observations imply that distinct PDE4 isoforms may control specific pools of cAMP and hence selectively influence particular cellular processes. Indeed, distinct pools of cAMP have recently been identified in cardiac myocytes (42Zaccolo M. Pozzan T. Science. 2002; 295: 1711-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar) where they are regulated by PDE activity. Thus manipulation of the expression profile of PDE4 isoforms provides a physiological and potential pharmacological mechanism of controlling cell cAMP signaling in cells. One mechanism, which might potentially alter local PDE4 expression patterns, is transcriptional control. However, little is know about the promoters that control the expression of the complex multigenic PDE family, save for work on PDE3 (43Kasuya J. Liang S.J. Goko H. Park S.H. Kato K., Xu, Z.D. Hockman S. Manganiello V.C. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), PDE4D1/2 short forms (44Vicini E. Conti M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 839-850PubMed Google Scholar), and the PDE4A10 long form (45Rena G. Begg F. Ross A. MacKenzie C. McPhee I. Campbell L. Huston E. Sullivan M. Houslay M.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 996-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of the short PDE4D1/2 isoforms by elevated cAMP levels has been suggested to contribute to the role that PDE4 isoforms play in cellular desensitization processes (44Vicini E. Conti M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 839-850PubMed Google Scholar). The other route by which PDE4 isoforms contribute to cellular desensitization being via the PKA-mediated activated of PDE4 long isoforms (46Oki N. Takahashi S.I. Hidaka H. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10831-10837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Because specific PDE4 isoforms can thus be expected to influence the nature of cAMP signaling in cells, it is important to identify and characterize the properties of the promoters that determine the expression of various PDE isoforms in particular cell types. In this study we describe the identification of the putativePDE4D5 promoter and demonstrate its ability to up-regulate reporter gene expression in response to conditions that increase cell cAMP content. We also present evidence for physiological up-regulation of PDE4D5 isoform expression and activity in human airway smooth muscle cells (hASMs) exposed to equivalent conditions. This is of potential clinical importance as the up-regulation of this isoform by its substrate could provide a negative feedback mechanism functionally downregulating the bronchodilator effect of β2 agonists in airways disease and thus diminishing the therapeutic efficacy of these agents. Accession numbers for complete cDNA sequences of each of the 5 PDE4D splice variants (PDE4D1, U50157; PDE4D2, U50158; PDE4D3, 50159; PDE4D4, L20969, and PDE4D5,AF012073) 2Relevant GenBankTM accession numbers are as follows: PDE4D1, U50157; PDE4D2, U50158; PDE4D3, 50159; PDE4D4, L20969; PDE4D5, AF012073; genomic fragments, AC026095,AC027322, and NT_006665. were compared with the entire unfinished human genome using the NCBI BLAST facility. Exact matches were obtained for all of the sequences from a range of contigs representing unfinished, unordered sequences of genomic DNA (AC026095,AC027322, and NT_006665). The verified cDNA sequences were used as templates to re-order the relevant sequences within these contigs, and thus elucidate the intron-exon arrangement of the PDE4Dgene. Sequence immediately upstream from the start codons of each of the 5 splice variants was then assessed using on-line transcription factor binding site-based, promoter predictive shareware packages. These included Matinspector Professional (Genomatix), TESS, and TSSG. The region containing the putative promoter region of PDE4D5, identified using in silico techniques, was amplified using standard PCR to generate an 1800 bp band. Amplification reactions were performed using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with the following primers: (forward, 5′-GCACACACATACCTTGCCACT-3′; reverse, 5′-TCACAAGGTCTTCGTTCAGC-3′). Products were separated by electrophoresis in an ethidium bromide-containing Tris acetate/EDTA 1% agarose gel. DNA was viewed under a low power UV light and bands excised using a sterile blade before purification from using StrataPrepTMDNA Extraction Kit (Stratagene) as outlined in the manufacturer's instructions. The eluted product was used as a template for subsequent PCRs. At this stage a mismatched reverse primer (5′-TGTCTGCTGAGCCATGGTCCT-3′) was designed to introduce aNcoI restriction site around the start codon of PDE4D5, and this was paired with two fully matched forward primers (long, GTTGTGCGCATGCTAACAGG; short, GCAGGGAAGTATTTCTCC) to create two different length amplicons. In these reactions a non-proofreadingTaq polymerase was used to allow the creation of mismatches in the sequence. After an identical purification procedure, 7 μl of the eluted products were ligated into 1 μl of Promega PGEM T Easy vector with 1 μl of T4-ligase and its single use 10× buffer at 4 °C overnight. The resultant plasmids were then used to transform 50 μl of competent Escherichia coli K12 strain JM109 bacteria and grown in ampicillin-containing broth. Colonies with successfully ligated vectors were selected using the blue/white screen integral to the PGEM T Easy vector and grown in broths prior to extraction of vector DNA using the Wizard Mini-Prep kit (Promega). This was then digested, in the case of the short construct, usingNcoI and a blunt-cutting XmnI (cut site within the forward primer) and the appropriate band separated by electrophoresis. The long construct was initially restricted withNcoI and a blunt cutting AviII again in its forward primer. A further restriction with Ksp632I was required to separate the band of interest. These two putative promoter fragments of 621 and 1544 bp in length, respectively, were then purified and ligated into PGL3 enhancer luciferase reporter vector cut with NcoI and SmaI to give a complementary staggered cut immediately in front of the luciferase start codon and a blunt end encouraging proper orientation of the putative promoters in the reporter vector. 2 μl of purified DNA was mixed with 1 μl of pre-cut and purified vector DNA in the 10-μl reaction mixture, and ligation was carried out at 15 °C over 3 h. The vectors were again transformed into E. colistrain JM109 and grown as above. This time colonies were selected at random before culturing in broths and extracting vector DNA. The broths were then streaked out to a single colony to ensure complete purification and regrown. After extraction and purification of vector DNA using Wizard Mini-Prep kits, the complete inserts were carefully sequenced using Promega internal vector primers (RV primer 3 (clockwise) and GL primer 2 (anti-clockwise)) to confirm that the inserted putative promoter sequence was of expected length and sequence and properly orientated. The same broths were then grown on a larger scale to allow extraction and purification of DNA using Wizard Maxi-Prep Kit. This method provided sufficient quantities of DNA for the planned transfection experiments. Prior to use, construct DNA concentration was analyzed by spectrophotometry. Using the wild-type promoter constructs as template DNA a cAMP response element (CRE) site, identified by in silico analysis of the PDE4D5promoter, was mutated using Stratagene QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit. Complementary primers were designed to encode a 4 base pair mutation in the CRE sequence most proximal to the start codon at position −201 in Fig.1 B (5′-gTGACGTTt to gTGTGTCTt-3′; uppercase letters denote CRE sequence and bold letters represent the mutation that was introduced.) The sequence of the 39-bp forward primer used was 5′-GCTTGGGAGAGGAGGGGTGTGTCTTAATACGCTTCCGCG-3′, and the reverse primer was exactly complementary. From the short and long construct transformation plates produced according to the manufacturer's protocol, four colonies were selected, grown on, and re-streaked to enable selection of a single colony. Purified vector DNA samples were obtained by Wizard Mini-Prep of the broths grown from selected colonies were sequenced across the inserts to confirm both the presence of the desired mutation and conservation of the remaining sequence. At this point larger amounts of construct were prepared using Wizard Maxi-prep, and DNA concentrations were assayed by spectrophotometry. Chinese hamster ovary cells, stably transfected with both the human β2 adrenoreceptor gene and the gene encoding human secreted placental alkaline phosphatase driven by a promoter containing six cyclic AMP response elements, were selected for the transfection experiments (47McDonnell J. Latif M.L. Rees E.S. Bevan N.J. Hill S.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The stably transfected system enabled a parallel assay of SPAP (proving that the cells were responding to stimulatory conditions and had the necessary cellular apparatus to produce a cAMP-dependent up-regulation of transcription), and luciferase to determine whether the transiently transfected putative PDE4D5 promoter construct could increase transcription of its reporter gene in response to the same conditions. These cells were randomly seeded in 24-well plates at a density created by the resuspension of a confluent 1 × 75 cm2 flask in 100 ml of Hams F-12 Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% serum and glutamine and a volume of 1 ml per well. The following day the medium was removed, and the cells were serum-starved prior to transient transfection with the relevant constructs. Transfection was performed in 90% confluent 24-well plates with each condition in triplicate per plate. FuGENE 6 (Roche) was used to transfect cells with a 40:1 ratio of test DNA andRenilla SV40 control vector. Plates were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C for 24 h. The wells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove any trace of the transfection mixture and glutamine, and serum-containing Hams F-12 DMEM was re-applied for 24 h to allow the cells to recover fully. At this point the medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of serum-free Hams F-12 DMEM per well in preparation for the assay. Within 18 h of serum starving the transiently transfected CHO K1 cells, serum-free medium was replaced and the drugs added at the requisite dilutions. The conditions used included forskolin (10 μm final concentration), isoprenaline (1 μm), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) (50 μm), actinomycin (4 μm), cycloheximide (50 μm), and 8 bromo-cAMP (1 mm). Any antagonists used were added 30 min prior to the relevant agonists. The plates were returned to the incubator for 5 h. At this point the medium was replaced with 300 μl per well of fresh serum-free medium and left for 1 h. 20 μl of the supernatant from each well was then aliquoted into a flat-bottomed 96-well plate with blank medium as controls. The 96-well plates were then heat-inactivated at 65 °C for exactly 30 min to remove endogenous alkaline phosphatase (SPAP is stable at this temperature). 1 ml of 100 mm p-nitrophenol phosphate (PNPP) was thawed and added to 20 ml of diethanolamine buffer immediately prior to the assay. 200 μl of this reaction mixture were then added to each well, and the plates kept for 35 min at 37 °C in room air in a light proof incubator. The timing of this incubation was determined by optimization experiments, which demonstrated that the maximal optical density below 1.5 (the range within which the relationship between absorbance and SPAP munits/ml remains linear) occurred between 30 and 40 min of incubation. Absorbance was measured on a Dynex Revelation 96-well plate reader at 405 nm and converted to munits/ml using the following equation: (munits/ml) =A/18.5tV; where A = optical density, t = time of incubation with PNPP, and V = volume of sample (20 μl in all experiments). Luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega). After collection of the SPAP assay data, the plates were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed using 200 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer (supplied reagent). The plates were rocked for 20 min at room temperature prior to storage at −80 °C until it was convenient to perform the assay. After preparation of the reagents according to the manufacturer's protocol, 20 μl of the thawed lysate from each well was mixed with 100 μl of the luciferase assay reagent II by vigorous pipetting. The firefly luciferase activity measurement (under the influence of the putative promoters) was then measured over 10 s by a luminometer. 100 μl of Stop & Glo reagent were then added and vortexed briefly to mix. This had the dual effect of quenching the initial reaction and catalyzing the bioluminescent reaction of Renillaluciferase. The latter is quantified by a 10-s luminometer measurement and used in the analysis to correct for well-to-well variations in transfection efficiency. hASMs were prepared from explants of trachealis muscle obtained from individuals free of respiratory disease within 12 h of death. A tracheal segment from immediately above the carina was removed and a strip of trachealis dissected clear of the surrounding tissue. Following initial washes with DMEM containing penicillin (200 units/ml), streptomycin (200 μg/liter), and amphotericin B (0.5 μg) the overlying mucosa was removed and 2-mm2 sections of smooth muscle were excised and placed in 6-well plates. Once adherent, the explants were covered in DMEM containing the above anti-microbials, 10% fetal bovine serum, and glutamine (2 mm). The medium was regularly replaced until muscle cell growth occurred. At this point the culture medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. When the cells around the explant approached confluence, the explant was removed, and 24 h later the cells were harvested by trypsinization and plated out into a 25-cm2 flask. Subsequent passages were performed in 75 and 162 cm2 flasks using the same culture medium; cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. Kotlikoff and co-workers (48Hall I.P. Kotlikoff M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L1-11PubMed Google Scholar, 49Panettieri R.A. Murray R.K. DePalo L.R. Yadvish P.A. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C329-C335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have extensively characterized the phenotype of these cells. hASMs cultured in this way were used for both PDE activity assays and reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). In order to standardize culture conditions for the two sets of experiments, cells destined for RNA extraction grown in 75 cm2 were passaged at the same times as those grown in 162 cm2 flasks for subsequent cell lysis. Exposure to the range of conditions described below was also carried out in parallel. Harvesting procedures are described in the relevant sections. Tritiated cAMP production was assayed using a previously described [3H]adenine prelabeling assay (50Hall I.P. Widdop S. Townsend P. Daykin K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 107: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, hASMs were grown in 24-well plates to confluence. For each plate 25 ml of Hanks HEPES Buffer (HHB) were warmed and mixed with 50 μl of tritiated adenine. The growth medium was then replaced with 1 ml per well of this mixture (2 μCi per well) and the cells incubated in air at 37 °C for 2 h. At the end of this period cells were washed in HHB before replacing the medium with HHB and adding 10 μl of antagonists in an appropriate concentrations to produce the final concentrations required. Cells were then incubated for 20 min prior to the addition of agonists. After a further 20 min (sufficient time to induce a significant increase in cAMP generation by hASMs in response to β agonist stimulation, Ref. 51Scott M.G. Swan C. Jobson T.M. Rees S. Hall I.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) the reaction was stopped by lysing the cells with 50 μl of concentrated HCl and freezing for a minimum of 2 h at −20 °C. Determination of cAMP formation in a lysed cell sample was achieved via a two-column separation system. Initially a 100-μl aliquot of the lysed sample was removed from each well and [3H]adenine counted to provide a correction factor for cell numbers per well. The lysate was then spiked with the same volume of 14C-labeled cAMP in medium. Column chromatography was performed to separate tritiated cAMP from other adenine-based cellular products. In the first column dowex 50 was used to adsorb cAMP. The majority of adenine-based cellular components were washed through with a carefully estimated volume of water. The dowex columns were then placed over alumina columns, and cAMP was washed through with a lar"

V-H+-PPases of several parasites were shown to be associated with acidic vacuoles named acidocalcisomes, which contain polyphosphate and calcium. In this work we functionally characterized a Trypanosoma brucei V-H+-PPase gene by using double-stranded RNA interference methodology to produce inducible V-H+-PPase-deficient strains of procyclic and bloodstream forms (PFiVP1 and BFiVP1). Acidocalcisomes of these mutated parasites lost acidity and contained 90% less polyphosphate. PFiVP1 did not release calcium after the addition of nigericin, and its total acidity was reduced by 70%. This mutant also failed to stabilize its intracellular pH on exposure to external basic pH >7.4 and recovered from intracellular acidification at a slower rate and to a more acidic final intracellular pH. In the absence of T. bruceiV-H+-PPase expression, PFiVP1 and BFiVP1 grew at a slower rate with doubling times of 27 h instead of 15 h, and 10 h instead of 7.5 h, respectively.

J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In trypanosomatids, these polyP vacuoles were called acidocalcisomes (2Scott D.A. Docampo R. Dvorak J.A. Shi S. Leapman R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28020-28029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and shown to be electron dense and contain large concentrations of PPi, calcium, magnesium, and other elements (3Docampo R.

Acidocalcisomes were postulated to play an important role in the regulation of both cytosolic Ca2+concentration and intracellular pH (pHi). For example, polyP hydrolysis (8Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46196-46203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and activation of the Na+/H+antiporter (9Vercesi A.E. Docampo R. Biochem.

Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) were postulated to protect the cells against alkaline pH stress and increase the intracellular Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i). In addition, these organelles possess a vacuolar-type H+-translocating pyrophosphatase (V-H+-PPase) (11Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L., Lu, H.G. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22151-22158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which is an electrogenic proton pump initially discovered in photosynthetic bacteria and plants (12Maeshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). It has been shown to be associated with the plasma membrane or vacuoles in plants and with the chromatophore membranes ofRhodospirullum rubrum. The biochemical function of this enzyme in plants and unicellular eukaryotes is to couple hydrolysis of the high energy phosphate bond of PPi with H+translocation from the cytosol to acidify the plant vacuole (tonoplast) or the acidocalcisome, respectively (10Docampo R. Moreno S.N.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 13Maeshima M. Yoshida S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20068-20073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Working on isolated acidocalcisomes, Rodrigues et al. (14Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that theTrypanosoma brucei H+-PPase was able to generate a membrane potential by PPi-dependent proton uptake. Moreover, Scott et al. (11Scott D.A. de Souza W. Benchimol M. Zhong L., Lu, H.G. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24215-24221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, the physiological importance of the V-H+-PPase was investigated less thoroughly because genetic approaches were not used. Studies of V-H+-PPase expression in plants have revealed higher expression levels in young growing tissue and during growth under stress (12Maeshima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that transgenic plants overexpressing V-H+-PPase become more resistant to high concentrations of NaCl and water deprivation than the isogenic wild-type strains (16Gaxiola R.A., Li, J. Undurraga S. Dang L.M. Allen G.J. Alper S.L. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11444-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Using RNA interference methodology (17Fire A., Xu, S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11651) Google Scholar), we have now shown thatT. brucei V-H+-PPase not only plays roles in the regulation of Ca2+, polyP, and H+ content of acidocalcisomes and pHi regulation of procyclics but also is required for normal in vitro growth of bloodstream and procyclic forms. T. brucei bruceiprocyclic form host cell line 29–13 and bloodstream form host cell line 90–13 co-expressing the T7 RNA polymerase and the Tet repressor were gifts from G. A.M. Cross (18Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Procyclic forms were cultivated to late log-phase in SDM-79 medium (19Brun R. Jenni L. Tanner M. Schonenberger M. Schell K.F. Acta Tropica. 1979; 36: 387-390PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Bloodstream forms were cultured in vitro in modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (20Baltz T. Baltz D. Giroud C. Crockett J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1273-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). A TBLASTN search of all available sequence databases using the amino acid sequence of V-H+-PPase ofT. cruzi (GenBankTM accession number AF159881) (21Hill J.E. Scott D.A. Luo S. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) yielded a 1.3-kb gene fragment mapping from 20 clones. These clones were derived from a T. brucei GUTat 10.1-sheared DNA library constructed at TIGR (www.tigr.org/tdb/mdb/tbdb/). Based on this information, a 1.2-cDNA fragment was cloned and sequenced by using reverse transcriptase-PCR technique with gene-specific primers TbP51 (5′-AGCCGTAGTGACGGCATGTT-3′) and TbP31 (5′-CACTGTTAGTTGCCGCAAGA-3′). To obtain full-length cDNA, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) techniques (22Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar) were performed using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) with primer Tb-5′-SL (5′-AACGCTATTATTAGAACAGTTTCTG-3′) and specific primers, TbP52 (5′-GTTGTCACCGATGCAGTC-3′) and TbP53 (5′-ATAGCAGTAGCTGTCGTGAC-3′), for 5′-RACE and oligo dT primer (5′-ATGGATGCCTACAGCGCTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) and specific primers, TbP32 (5′-GCAGAGTATCGGTACATGG-3′) and TbP33 (5′-TCTTGCGGCAACTAACAGTG-3′), for 3′-RACE. PCR products were cloned into the TA-cloning pCRII vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced using BigdyeTM Terminator version 3.0 Ready Reaction Cycle sequencing kit (ABI PRISM®). DNA sequence data were generated at the High Throughput Sequencing and Genotyping Unit of the Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Sequence analysis was done using the Biology Workbench 3.0 utility (workbench.sdsc.uiuc.edu), the Wisconsin Package (version 10.0-UNIX, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). The PSORT program was from Kenta Nakai (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). The complete gene sequence for TbVP1 was submitted to the GenBankTM data base (GenBankTM accession number AY 043295). Total genomic DNA from T. brucei procyclic forms (10 μg/lane) were digested withBamHI, EcoRI, HindIII,PstI, SacI, XbaI, and XhoI separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The blot was probed with a [α-32P]dCTP-labeled 1.2-kb cDNA fragment of TbVP1 (nucleotides 168–1387). After hybridization, the blot was washed three times in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS (pre-warmed to 65 °C where 1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m sodium citrate). A 357-bp fragment comprising the loop III and adjacent regions of TbVP1 gene was generated by PCR. The 5′ primer (5′-GCGGCGCATATGGCTCTCTTCTGCACGGTG-3′) contained a 12-nucleotide linker with an NdeI restriction site to facilitate subcloning and 5′-adjacent N-terminal residues. The 3′ primer (5′-CAGGACCTCGAGGTCTGCGCTGAGCTCGGC-3′) included a 12-nucleotide linker with a XhoI site for cloning. The PCR product was inserted into the NdeI/XhoI sites of the pET23a plasmid (Novagen). The resulting recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) from Novagen according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were lysed, and the recombinant protein was purified as previously described after solubilization in 6m urea (23Bakalara N. Santarelli X. Davis C. Baltz T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8863-8871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Mice were first injected with 10 μg of TbVP1L3 in complete Freund's adjuvant and with another 10 μg in incomplete Freund's adjuvant 15 and 30 days later. Blood was collected before the first injection (pre-immune serum) and 10, 13, and 15 days following the last injection. Western blotting was performed as described previously (24Dutoya S. Gibert S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 49117-49124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with serum diluted 1/200 and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The second antibody, a 1/5000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), was incubated for 2 h in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween 20 milk. Immunoreactive bands were revealed by washing in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, and a ECL revelation kit (Amersham Biosciences). For indirect immunofluorescence, procyclic and bloodstream forms of trypanosomes were fixed for 15 min in 2% formaldehyde (24Dutoya S. Gibert S. Lemercier G. Santarelli X. Baltz D. Baltz T.

Oregon Green 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) was used as a secondary antibody diluted (1/1000) in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% Triton X-100 for an additional 30 min. After washing, slides containing the treated trypanosomes were mounted with anti-fade Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). For observation of Acridine Orange accumulation, cells were washed twice in a buffer containing 116 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 50 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.4, and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in the same buffer with 6 μm Acridine Orange. Parasites were then partially immobilized by centrifugation at 130 × g for 10 min on poly-l-lysine glass coverslips as described previously (25Cuvillier A. Redon F. Antoine J.C. Chardin P. DeVos T. Merlin G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2065-2074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coverslides with immobilized living parasites were observed under a fluorescent microscope fitted with a fluorescein filter set. Cells were examined on a Zeiss UV microscope, and images taken with a camera (Photometrics) with Metaview and Adobe Photoshop 6 (Adobe Systems) software. For observation of DAPI accumulation, cells were washed twice in a buffer containing 116 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 50 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.4, and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in the same buffer with 10 μg/ml DAPI (8Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46196-46203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cells were then treated and observed for Acridine Orange accumulation. The inducible T7 RNA polymerase-based protein expression system developed by Wirtz et al. (18Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) was used in this study. The pLew 100 vector (18Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by G.A.M. Cross. For double-stranded RNA expression, the following construct was produced as described previously (26Bringaud F. Robinson D.R. Barradeau S. Biteau N. Baltz D. Baltz T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DNA fragments corresponding to the coding regions of TbVP1 from nucleotides 99 to 416 and from nucleotides 99 to 464 were PCR-amplified. The 317-bp fragment was amplified using the following set of primers: DB/VP/01 (5′-CCGGTTCTGCAGGGATTCATGAGTGTCACGACAGCTAC-3′) and DB/VP/02 (5′-CCGGTTGAATTCCCGGCCGTCTTTGCCTCC-3′). The 365-bp fragment was amplified with the two following primers, DB/VP/03 (5′-CCGGTTAAGCTTATGAGTGTCACGACAGCT-3′) and DB/VP/04 (5′-CCGGTTGAATTCAAGGGAAAATGCAGCATTC-3′). After precloning in the pGEMt vector (Promega), the resulting fragment was cloned between theBamH1 and HindIII restriction sites of pLew100. The resulting construction was named pLew 100-SVP. For stable transformation, T. brucei procyclic forms (29–13 cell line) were harvested from a log-phase culture (5 × 106 cells), washed once in Zimmerman post-fusion medium (ZPFM) (18Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), and resuspended to a cell density of 4 × 107 cells/ml in ZPFM cells were electroporated with 10 μg of DNA using the Eurogentech CellJect machine at 1600 V, infinite resistance, and 40 microfarads. Parasites were then transferred to SDM-79 medium containing 10 μg/ml G418 and 5 μg/ml hygromycin. The modified strain was named PFiVP1 and induced for 5 days with 1 μg/ml tetracycline. Cells were diluted 10-fold when densities reached a minimum of 1 × 106 cells/ml. They were not allowed to grow beyond 5 × 106 cells/ml before diluting again. For stable transfection of bloodstream forms, cells were harvested from a log-phase culture, washed once in ZPFM and 55 mmglucose and resuspended in ZPFMG containing 2 mm ATP and 5 mm glutathione to a cell density of 2 × 107 cells/ml (27Wirtz E. Hoek M. Cross G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4626-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H.

Surviving cells were then seeded in a microtiter plate as described by Wirtz et al.(27Wirtz E. Hoek M. Cross G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4626-4634Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and selection was applied the following day by adding phleomycin to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml. Two clones were obtained: BFiVP1/1A1 and BFiVP1/2A2. Cells were diluted 20-fold when densities reached a minimum of 5 × 105 cells/ml. They were not allowed to grow beyond 1 × 106 cells/ml before diluting again. The genetically modified strain was induced for 4 days with 1 μg/ml tetracycline. The [Ca2+]i and pHi were measured according to Scott et al. (29Scott D.A. Moreno S.N. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and Fraser-L'Hostis et al.(30Fraser-L'Hostis C. Defrise-Quertain F. Coral D. Deshusses J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 1039-1046PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Cells were loaded with either Fura 2/AM or BCECF/AM (Molecular Probes) and resuspended in Buffer A containing 116 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EGTA for [Ca2+]i determination. The Fura 2 fluorescence response to the [Ca2+]i was calibrated from the ratio of 340/380-nm fluorescence values for an emission at 510 nm. [Ca2+]i was estimated according to the calcium concentration buffer kit (Molecular Probes) and the Winmax software (www.stanford.edu/∼cpatton/maxc.html). For pHi, we used the wavelengths 490 and 440 nm for excitation and 535 nm for emission. The spectrofluorometer fluoromax (SPEX Instruments) and software DM 3000 (SPEX Instruments) were used for data analysis. The ratio of intensities (F490/F440) was used to calculate the intracellular pH according to a calibration curve determined by the incubation of BCECF-loaded trypanosomes treated with 2 μmnigericin in a buffer containing 116 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes, 20 mm Mes covering the pH range from 6.5 to 8. After harvesting and washing, 107 cells/ml (50 μg of protein) were incubated with 150 μm Neutral Red in culture medium for 30 min. After three washes in Ringer's solution (155 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, 10 mm glucose, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 107 cells were lysed in 1 ml of water/ethanol/acetic acid (50:49:1) and the amount of dye incorporated was determined spectrophotometrically at 540 nm (31Burkhardt J.K. Wiebel F.A. Hester S. Argon Y. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1845-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Cells (0.2 mg of protein/ml equivalent to 2.5 × 107 cells) were added to a buffer containing 2 mm MgSO4, 50 μm EGTA, 10 mm K-Hepes, pH 7.2, 65 mm KCl, and 125 mm sucrose. Acridine Orange was used at 3 μm, PPi at 0.1 mm, ATP at 1 mm, and digitonin at 16 μm. The spectrophotometer Cary 100 (Varian) was used to follow Acridine Orange uptake as described previously (14Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PolyP levels were determined as described by Ruiz et al. (8Ruiz F.A. Rodrigues C.O. Docampo R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46196-46203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) using the recombinant exopolyphosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PFiVP1 procyclic trypomastigotes were induced with 1 μg/ml tetracycline during 4 days. 2 × 107cells then were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and long and short chain polyP was quantified. Subcellular fractionation was performed according to Rodrigues et al. (14Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Procyclic cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (125 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing a protease inhibitor mixture with final concentrations of 1 μm chemostatin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After lysis and removal of silicon carbide by centrifugation at 144 × g for 5 min, the extract was centrifuged again at 580 × g for 10 min. 5.76 ml of supernatant were mixed with 6.12 ml of Percoll and 6.12 ml of 0.5 m sucrose before centrifugation at 69,500 × g for 50 min. To screen for genes encoding plant-like V-H+-PPases in T. brucei, the amino acid sequence of V-H+-PPase from T. cruzi, TcPPase (21Hill J.E. Scott D.A. Luo S. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), was used to search all available sequence databases using TBLASTN. This search yielded a 1.3-kb gene fragment, which closely resembled the region encompassed by nucleotides encoding amino acid residues 10–445 of TcPPase. On the basis of this information, we cloned TbVP1 by using the reverse transcriptase-PCR technique. This 1.2-kb cDNA enabled appropriate gene-specific primers to be designed for the generation of 5′-end and 3′-end DNA fragments by using the RACE method (22Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4329) Google Scholar) and the reconstruction of a full-length cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of 3510 bp revealed an open reading frame of 2481 bp (nucleotides 136–2616) that encodes a 826-amino acid protein with a relative molecular mass of 85.9 kDa and a calculated pI of 5.08. To assess the copy number of TbVP1 in the nuclear genome ofT. brucei, Southern blots were probed with a 1.2-kb cDNA fragment (nucleotides 168–1387) (data not shown). Under stringent conditions, the blot contained a single band except when predicted internal restriction sites (PstI and SacI) were present. These data together with the reverse transcriptase-PCR, 5′-RACE, and 3′-RACE were consistent with a single copy number gene in the T. brucei genome. While this paper was in preparation, a search of GenBank and theT. brucei genome project databases using the full-length cDNA of TbVP1 indicated the existence in chromosome IV (GenBankTM accession number AC09781, nucleotides 161180–163660) of a predicted amino acid sequence potentially encoding for a V-H+-PPase-like protein. The open reading frame was identical to the full-length cDNA. When the cDNA sequence was compared with the genomic sequence from chromosome IV, the predicted translation initiation site of TbVP1 was preceded by 102 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence. The polyadenylation site ofTbVP1 was preceded by 874 bp of 3′- untranslated sequence. The HMMTOP software (www.enzim.hu/hmmtop) revealed the presence of the 15 potential transmembrane domains that we oriented as described previously (Fig.1) (32Drozdowicz Y.M., Lu, Y.P. Patel V. Fitz-Gibbon S. Miller J.H. Rea P.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We have no experimental evidence for the membrane orientation of TbVP1. However, the N-terminal extremity analyzed by the sequence analysis PSORT (psort.nibb.ac.jp), may correspond to a 26-amino acid signal peptide with a predictable cleavage site at positions 26–27. This last characteristic was previously reported by Hill et al. (21Hill J.E. Scott D.A. Luo S. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) for the T. cruzi V-H+-PPase and was suggested to play a role in enzyme sorting. The sequence comparison analysis shown in Fig. 1 confirmed the presence in TbVP1 of the five “tool box” sequences characteristic of the V-H+-PPases (33Drozdowicz Y.M. Rea P.A. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 206-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In particular, the cytosolic loop III containing the putative PPi binding motif (D/E)X 7KXE is conserved (34Rea P.A. Kim Y. Sarafian V. Poole R.J. Davies J.M. Sanders D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 348-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In a first step toward the characterization of TbVP1, we analyzed its subcellular location in bloodstream and procyclic trypomastigote forms. An histidine-tagged recombinant protein (A259 to D377), comprising loop III and the two adjacent regions, was expressed in E. coli, purified by Ni2+HisBindTM chromatography and used to immunize mice. Indirect immunofluorescence using this antiserum as the probe revealed vesicular-like structures of varying sizes in procyclic and bloodstream forms indicating expression in both stages. These structures are mainly distributed in the central region, with some additional vesicles at the anterior region of the bloodstream forms (Fig.2 A). A similar distribution of acidocalcisomes in T. brucei was previously reported (14Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further analyze the subcellular location of TbVP1, we obtained procyclic acidocalcisomes from a high density Percoll gradient fraction of trypanosomes as described previously (14Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We observed by immunofluorescence that 80% of the purified high density vesicles were recognized by the anti-TbVP1 mouse antiserum, indicating an association of this V-H+-PPase with acidocalcisomes (data not shown). TbVP1 was also detected by Western blots of this high density fraction (Fig. 2 B). No reaction was detected when the antiserum was pre-adsorbed with the His-tagged TbVP1L3 protein (Fig 2 B). The recognized polypeptide had an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa. A size discrepancy between the expected (80 kDa) and the observed molecular mass was already reported for the V-H+-PPases of plants (35Sarafian V. Kim Y. Poole R.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1775-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 36Kim Y. Kim E.J. Rea P.A. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1994; 106: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and trypanosomatids (21Hill J.E. Scott D.A. Luo S. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It could be attributed either to the usual anomalous migration of hydrophobic proteins on SDS gels (37Maddy A.H. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 62: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or to partial degradation. In agreement with these results, Fig.2 B shows that the 55-kDa protein band is absent in a mutant deficient in V-H+-PPase (see below). We conclude that TbVP1 is associated with vesicles of size, distribution, and density that correspond to the acidocalcisomal compartment. PPi-driven H+ transport activity was shown previously to be associated with acidocalcisomes (14Rodrigues C.O. Scott D.A. Docampo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7712-7723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using RNA interference methodology to silence TbVP1 expression, we tested whether in the absence of TbVP1 acidocalcisomes failed to display PPi-dependent H+-translocating activity. Because TbVP1 is expressed and associated with acidocalcisomes in both procyclic and bloodstream trypomastigote forms, the gene-silencing experiment was performed initially on the former stages. After 5 days of double-stranded RNA expression, TbVP1 protein in the acidocalcisomes completely disappeared (Fig.3 A, photograph b), indicating high stability and slow turnover of the protein. Nevertheless, the presence of acidocalcisomes was confirmed by electron microscopy (data not shown). Procyclic trypomastigotes permeabilized with digitonin were shown to accumulate and retain the weak base Acridine Orange after the addition of 0.1 mm PPi. The resultant H+gradient collapsed completely after the addition of 1 μmnigericin, a H+/K+ ionophore, or the alkalinizing agent NH4Cl, confirming that the Acridine Orange absorbance decrease was attributed to its accumulation in an acidic compartment (Fig. 3 B) a"

Because tyrphostins have chemical structures similar to those of the phenolic antioxidants, we decided to test the protective efficacy of tyrphostins against oxidative stress-induced nerve cell death (oxytosis). Many commercially available tyrphostins, at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 200 μm, protect both HT-22 hippocampal cells and rat primary neurons from oxytosis brought about by treatment with glutamate, as well as by treatment with homocysteic acid and buthionine sulfoximine. The tyrphostins protect nerve cells by three distinct mechanisms. Some tyrphostins, such as A25, act as antioxidants and eliminate the reactive oxygen species that accumulate as a result of glutamate treatment. These tyrphostins also protect cells from hydrogen peroxide and act as antioxidants in anin vitro assay. In contrast, tyrphostins A9 and AG126 act as mitochondrial uncouplers, collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential and thereby reducing the generation of reactive oxygen species from mitochondria during glutamate toxicity. Finally, the third group of tyrphostins does not appear to be effective as antioxidants but rather protects cells by increasing the basal level of cellular glutathione.

Pathol. 2001; 54: 386-392PubMed Google Scholar) may also result from oxidative stress. Oxidative stress arises from an excessive production or decreased clearance of reactive oxygen species (ROS),1 resulting in accumulation of ROS, cellular damage, and eventual cell death. Sources of ROS in cells include oxygenases, oxidases, and nitric-oxide synthetases (13Davies K.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1995; 61: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Mitochondria also produce a significant level of ROS during normal respiration as well as during cell death (13Davies K.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1995; 61: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 14Reynolds I.J. Hastings T.G. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3318-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Molecules in the cell that can eliminate ROS include catalase and glutathione peroxidases and the nonenzymic, small antioxidants glutathione (GSH), vitamin C, and vitamin E (13Davies K.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1995; 61: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Molecular and cellular events underlying neuronal death induced by oxidative stress have been characterized in the hippocampal cell line HT-22 and cortical neurons (15Davis J.B. Maher P. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 16Maher P. Davis J.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6394-6401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Tan S. Wood M. Maher P. J.

This pathway of programmed cell death, termed oxytosis (19Tan S. Schubert D. Maher P. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2001; 1: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), is initiated by the addition of glutamate to the extracellular medium. Glutamate then inhibits the uptake of cystine, which is required for GSH synthesis (20Bannai S. Ishii T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 112: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), resulting in the depletion of GSH in neurons (15Davis J.B. Maher P. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 21Murphy T.H. Miyamoto M. Sastre A. Schnaar R.L. Coyle J.T.

Subsequently, this decrease in cellular GSH results in the production of ROS by mitochondria. The production and accumulation of ROS proceed in two phases: an initial slow increase up to 5- to 10-fold of the control level, followed by an explosive generation up to 200 times greater than the control level. The higher rate of ROS increase begins after the cellular GSH levels fall below 20% of the control (18Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The importance of mitochondria in ROS production is supported by the observation that the mitochondrial uncoupler cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) and other mitochondrial inhibitors protect neuronal cells from glutamate toxicity (18Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The ROS accumulation then causes Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium, which leads to cell death. The central role of ROS in this cell death cascade is evidenced by the observation that exogenously added antioxidants such as vitamin E and propyl gallate (PG) (Fig. 1) protect cells from glutamate toxicity (15Davis J.B. Maher P. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 18Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J.

In addition to the elucidation of the steps involved in oxytosis, HT-22 cells have been used to screen potentially therapeutic drugs for the treatment of clinical conditions involving oxidative stress (24Ishige K.

The tyrphostins are a family of structurally related phenolic compounds that inhibit protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) (29Gazit A. Yaish P. Gilon C. Levitzki A. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 30Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Because the elevated activities of specific PTKs may cause cancers and other proliferative disorders, Levitzki and his co-workers (29Gazit A. Yaish P. Gilon C. Levitzki A. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 31Gazit A. Osherov N. Posner I. Yaish P. Poradosu E. Gilon C. Levitzki A. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 1896-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) synthesized a variety of tyrphostins from tyrosine and erbstatin. Thus, some tyrphostins inhibit specific PTKs such as the epidermal growth factor receptor without affecting other PTKs such as the insulin receptor (32Yaish P. Gazit A. Gilon C. Levitzki A. Science. 1988; 242: 933-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Because of their selective inhibition and low toxicity (33Levitzki A. Gilon C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1991; 12: 171-174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), tyrphostins may have therapeutic value for the treatment of pathological conditions caused by the excessive activity of specific PTKs (34Yoneda T. Lyall R.M. Alsina M.M. Persons P.E. Spada A.P. Levitzki A. Zilberstein A. Mundy G.R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4430-4435PubMed Google Scholar). However, some tyrphostins appear to affect not only PTKs but also other enzymes and biological functions independent of their effects on PTKs. For example, tyrphostins can affect phosphodiesterases (35Nichols M.R. Morimoto B.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 366: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Andreis P.G. Neri G.

Aussel C. Breittmayer J.P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1468-1473PubMed Google Scholar), and mitochondrial membrane potential in HL-60 cells (38Burger A.M. Kaur G. Alley M.C. Supko J.G. Malspeis L. Grever M.R. Sausville E.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2794-2799PubMed Google Scholar) independently of their effects on PTKs. Tyrphostins generally have a phenolic structure that closely resembles that of antioxidants such as vitamin E and PG (Fig.1). Because these latter compounds protect HT-22 cells from oxidative glutamate toxicity, we decided to test the protective efficacy of tyrphostins in this system. We report here that many tyrphostins protect the nerve cell line HT-22, as well as rat primary neurons from cell death induced by oxidative glutamate toxicity. Additionally, tyrphostins protect nerve cells from oxidative injury caused by homocysteic acid and buthionine sulfoximine. The protection by tyrphostins is independent of their ability to inhibit tyrosine kinases. Instead, three distinct mechanisms appear to be involved in the protection of the nerve cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death. First, some tyrphostins (A23 and A25, for example) protect the nerve cells by acting as antioxidants. This conclusion is derived from the ability of these tyrphostins to quench free radicals both in a cell-free system and directly in nerve cells that have accumulated high levels of ROS. Second, many tyrphostins induce γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis, resulting in an increased basal GSH level and protection of the cells. Third, tyrphostins A9 and AG126 protect cells from glutamate toxicity by their ability to decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential, which results in a decrease in ROS production after glutamate treatment. Thus, many tyrphostins possess additional, important biological activities that are independent of their ability to inhibit PTKs. Tyrphostins were purchased from Alexis (San Diego, CA) or Calbiochem. Because of stability issues (39Ramdas L. McMurray J.S. Budde R.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 867-869PubMed Google Scholar, 40Kumar N. Windisch V. Ammon H.L. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1995; 12: 1708-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), stock solutions of tyrphostins were prepared in 100% Me2SO and kept in the dark at −20 °C. 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein (H2DCF)-diacetate, indo-1, Pluronic 127, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethyl-benzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and rhodamine-123 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other chemicals were from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and dialyzed FBS were from Hyclone (Irvine, CA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from Invitrogen. HT-22 cells (15Davis J.B. Maher P. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 16Maher P. Davis J.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6394-6401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were derived from the immortalized mouse hippocampal cell line HT-4 (41Morimoto B.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Neuron. 1990; 5: 875-880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and grown on tissue culture dishes (Falcon, Indianapolis, IN) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Pancreatin (Invitrogen) was used to dissociate the cells from the culture dishes. Short-term cultures of primary cortical neurons from 17-day-old rat embryos were prepared according to Abe and Kimura (42Abe K. Kimura H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2074-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The primary cells were used for experiments within 3 days after plating and do not express functional ionotropic glutamate receptors. Cell viability was determined by a modified version of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (43Liu Y. Peterson D.A. Kimura H. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 44Sagara Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1002-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) based on the standard procedure (45Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded onto 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 2.0 × 103 cells/well in 100 μl of 10% dialyzed FBS. The next day, cells were treated with various protective reagents for 30 min before the addition of a toxic agent (glutamate, HCA, and BSO). 24 h after the addition of a toxic agent, the cell culture medium in each well was aspirated and replaced with fresh 10% dialyzed FBS containing 2.5 μg/ml MTT. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were solubilized with 100 μl of a solution containing 50% dimethylformamide and 20% SDS (pH 4.7). The absorbance at 560 nm was measured on the following day with a microplate reader (ICN Flow Titertec Multiskan PLUS-Mk 11). Results obtained from the MTT assay correlated directly with the extent of cell death as confirmed visually (see, for example, Fig. 2) as well as the lactate dehydrogenase release assay (data not shown). For hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) toxicity, cells were preincubated with a tyrphostin for 30 min before the addition of H2O2. 2 h later, the cell culture medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh medium. The next day, cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay as described above. A light microscope (Inverted Microscope Diaphot-TMD; Nikon) equipped with a phase-contrast condenser (Phase contrast-2 ELWD 0.3; Nikon), 10× objective lens, and a digital camera (Coolpix 990; Nikon) was used to capture the images with the manual setting. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected by scraping, and lysed with 3% sulfosalicylic acid. Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min, and supernatants were collected after centrifugation in an Eppendorf microfuge. Upon neutralization of the supernatant with triethanolamine, the concentration of total glutathione (reduced and oxidized) was determined by the method of Tietze (46Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5547) Google Scholar) with modifications (24Ishige K. Schubert D. Sagara Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Briefly, a neutralized supernatant from above (25 μl) was mixed with 175 μl of a reaction mixture containing 143 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 6.3 mmNa4EDTA, 6 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), and 0.25 mg/ml NADPH. The reaction was started by adding 1 unit/ml glutathione reductase. Color development was monitored at 405 nm in a kinetic mode with a microplate reader (ICN Flow Titertec Multiskan PLUS-Mk 11). Pure GSH was used to obtain a standard curve. The protein content of each sample was determined using the BCA protein assay kit from Pierce with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The intracellular accumulation of ROS in HT-22 cells was determined with H2DCF-diacetate (44Sagara Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1002-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This nonfluorescent compound accumulates within cells upon deacetylation. H2DCF then reacts with ROS to form fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF) (47Bass D.A. Parce J.W. Dechatelet L.R. Szejda P. Seeds M.C. Thomas M. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 1910-1917PubMed Google Scholar). HT-22 cells were dissociated from tissue culture dishes with pancreatin in DMEM in the presence of 10 μm H2DCF-diacetate for 10 min at 37 °C, washed once with room temperature DMEM (without phenol red) supplemented with 2% dialyzed FBS, and resuspended in 750 μl of the same solution containing 2 μg/ml propidium iodide. The use of pancreatin did not affect the outcome of the flow cytometric experiments as confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a FACScan instrument (BD PharMingen) with an excitation wavelength (λex) of 475 nm and an emission wavelength (λem) of 525 nm. Data were collected in list mode on 10,000 cells after gating only for characteristic forwardversus orthogonal light scatter and low propidium iodide fluorescence to exclude dead cells. Median fluorescence intensities of control and test samples were determined with CellQuest™ software (BD PharMingen). JC-1 was used to determine the mitochondrial membrane potential (44Sagara Y. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1002-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 48Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). This lipophilic cation dye aggregates reversibly in mitochondria due to the membrane potential, resulting in a fluorescence shift from green (527 nm of the monomer) to orange (590 nm of the aggregate) (49Smiley S.T. Reers M. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Lin M. Chen A. Smith T.W. Steele Jr., G.D. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3671-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once with DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS to remove test compounds before loading with 5 μg/ml JC-1 for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were then dissociated with 1× trypsin/EDTA, centrifuged, and washed once with DMEM lacking phenol red. Cell pellets were resuspended in DMEM without phenol red, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (2 μg/ml) was added to the samples to allow the gating out of dead cells. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a LSR three-laser six-color analytic flow cytometer (BD PharMingen). λex = 475 nm, and λem = 530 nm (the monomer JC-1), and λem = 585 nm (the aggregate JC-1); λex = 345 nm, and λem = 455 nm for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Values of TEAC for tyrphostins and other compounds were determined according to Rice-Evans and Miller (24Ishige K. Schubert D. Sagara Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 50Rice-Evans C. Miller N.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 234: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Briefly, 150 μm 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline 6-sulfonate), 2.5 μm metomyoglobin, and 75 μmH2O2 were mixed in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline solution. Then, the change in absorbance due to the formation of the 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline 6-sulfonate) free radical was measured at 734 nm for 7.5 min. The inhibition of this free radical formation by the inclusion of 1.0 mm Trolox in the assay solution was used as a basis for the determination of TEAC values for tyrphostins and other compounds. Protein tyrosine kinase activity was measured on extracts from untreated and tyrphostin-treated HT-22 cells exactly as described previously (51Maher P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells on 60-mm dishes were scraped into 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na2VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, 20 μl of each supernatant were assayed for protein tyrosine kinase activity in a total volume of 50 μl containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 50 μmNa2VO4, 50 μm ATP (Sigma), 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml; ICN), and 1 mg/ml poly(Glu:Tyr; 4:1) (MWviscosity 45,700; Sigma). The assay was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of 15 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. 30 μl of each reaction were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gels were stained with 1% Coomassie Blue, destained, dried, and autoradiographed overnight. To quantify the amount of 32P incorporated into the poly amino acid substrate, the section of each lane containing the radiophosphorylated substrate was cut out and counted in a scintillation counter (Cerenkov counts). Control reactions containing the cell extracts but no substrate were run in parallel, and the counts from these lanes were subtracted from those of lanes containing the substrate. The results were normalized to the amount of protein in each extract as determined using the BCA protein assay. Similar results were obtained when overall protein tyrosine phosphorylation was measured using immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (data not shown). For Western blotting, cells from subconfluent cultures were washed twice in cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were solubilized in 2.5× SDS sample buffer, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose. Transfers were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in the primary antibody diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline/0.05% Tween 20. The primary antibodies used were anti-catalytic subunit of γ-GCS (from Dr. H. J. Forman) and anti-actin. The transfers were rinsed with Tris-buffered saline/0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:5000 in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20. The immunoblots were developed with the Super Signal reagent (Pierce). Experiments presented were repeated at least three times with triplicate samples. The data are presented as means ± S.E. Glutamate kills the hippocampal cell line HT-22 by a mechanism that involves the accumulation of ROS (15Davis J.B. Maher P. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 18Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). This system is useful for screening chemical compounds that are protective against glutamate toxicity and other oxidative insults (15Davis J.B. Maher P. Brain Res. 1994; 652: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 24Ishige K. Schubert D. Sagara Y. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 26Sagara Y. Schubert D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6662-6671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, A and D, HT-22 cells are killed by glutamate within 24 h. To determine whether tyrphostins can protect the cells from glutamate toxicity, HT-22 cells were exposed to 5 mm glutamate for 24 h in the presence of 10 μm tyrphostin A25 or 1 μmtyrphostin A9, and cell viability was examined by light microscopy. The addition of tyrphostin A25 (Fig. 2, B and E) or tyrphostin A9 (Fig. 2, C and F) strongly protects the HT-22 cells from glutamate toxicity. Protection by these tyrphostins is not transient; the nerve cells are viable in toxic doses of glutamate for at least 3 days if a protective tyrphostin is continuously present (data not shown). To quantify the protection provided by the different tyrphostins, HT-22 cells were exposed to various concentrations of glutamate in the presence of each tyrphostin for 24 h, and then cell viability was assessed by the MTT assay (43Liu Y. Peterson D.A. Kimura H. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The half-maximal concentration for glutamate toxicity is 2.0 mm, whereas 5 mm glutamate causes 90–100% of the cells to die (Fig.3 A). The inclusion of 10 μm A25 or 1 μm A9 in the assay completely protects the HT-22 cells from death, even in the presence of 10 mm glutamate. Similar results were obtained when the lactate dehydrogenase release assay was used to determine cell viability (data not shown). Tyrphostins A25 and A9, as well as A23, are also effective in protecting rat primary cortical neurons from oxidative glutamate toxicity (Fig. 3 B). Whereas some tyrphostins (A9, A23, and A25) were very effective in protecting the HT-22 cells from oxidative glutamate toxicity, other tyrphostins were either less effective or completely ineffective. To directly compare the protective efficacy of the different tyrphostins, HT-22 cells were exposed to 5 mm glutamate in the presence of various concentrations of each tyrphostin, and after 24 h, cell viability was determined by the MTT assay (Fig. 3 C). Tyrphostin A25 has an effective half-maximal concentration for protection (EC50) of 6 μm, and maximal protection is observed with concentrations higher than 10 μm (Fig. 3 C). Tyrphostin A9 is more effective than A25; the EC50 for A9 is 0.2 μm, and maximal protection is achieved at 1 μm (Fig.3 C). Among the less effective tyrphostins are A1, which is commonly used as a negative control for the tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity of other tyrphostins (29Gazit A. Yaish P. Gilon C. Levitzki A. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), and AG10 (Fig. 3, A andC), both of which have effective half-maximal concentrations for protection 8- to 15-fold higher than that for A25. Other tyrphostins, such as RG13022 and RG14620, are completely ineffective at protecting cells from oxidative stress (TableI). These results suggest certain structural requirements for protection from oxidative stress and will be addressed further in the “Discussion.”Table IProtective efficacy of various tyrphostins against pro-oxidantsABC nameAG nameOther namesR1R2R3R4Toxicity LD50Glutamate EC50HCA EC50BSO EC50H2O2 EC50TEACPDGFR-K IC50EGFR-K IC50μmμmμmμmμmmmμmμmA1AG9HOCH3HCN150100.0NOa,bNONO0.08 ± 0.08>1250A8AG10HOHHCN15050.0NO1-aNO, not protective., 1-bProtective at concentrations around LD50.NONO0560A23AG18RG50858OHOHHCN15011.01515143.42 ± 0.602535A24AG34OCH3OHOHCN5012.2"
https://openalex.org/W1986283944,"Brk (breast tumor kinase) is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is most closely related to the Frk family of kinases, and more distantly to Src family kinases. Brk was originally identified in a screen for tyrosine kinases that are overexpressed in human metastatic breast tumors. To shed light on the activity and regulation of Brk and related tyrosine kinases, we expressed and purified Brk using the Sf9/baculovirus system. We characterized the substrate specificity of Brk using synthetic peptides, and we show that the kinetic parametersKm and kcat both play a role in specificity. We carried out mass spectrometry experiments to show that Brk autophosphorylates within the predicted kinase activation loop and at additional sites in the N terminus. Autophosphorylation increases enzyme activity of wild-type Brk but not of a Y342A mutant form of Brk. We also carried out experiments to address the possible involvement of the Src homology (SH) 2 and SH3 domains of Brk in enzyme regulation. Mutation of a C-terminal tyrosine (Tyr-447) increases enzyme activity and SH2 domain accessibility, consistent with a role for this residue in autoinhibition. A proline-rich peptide activates Brk, suggesting that the SH3 domain is also involved in maintaining an inactive form of Brk. These biochemical results for Brk may aid in the understanding of other tyrosine kinases in the Frk family.

Brk expression was low or undetectable in normal mammary tissues or in benign lesions. However, approximately two-thirds of the breast tumors that were examined expressed significant levels of Brk, and 27% of the tumors overexpressed Brk by ≥5-fold (one tumor displayed a 43-fold increase in Brk expression) (2Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Expression of Brk in cultured mammary epithelial cells makes them more sensitive to the mitogenic effects of EGF,1 and increases anchorage-independent proliferation (3Kamalati T. Jolin H.E.

These results suggest that inappropriate expression of Brk may contribute to the development of breast cancer. Brk is usually considered to be a member of a separate family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (the Frk family) that includes Frk, Brk, Srms, and Sik, the mouse ortholog of Brk (1Mitchell P.J.

Brk is more distantly related to the Src family kinases (there is 46% amino acid identity between Brk and c-Src) (1Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Martindale J.E. Kamalati T. Lowe P.N. Page M.J.

Unlike Src family kinases, Brk lacks an N-terminal consensus sequence for acylation and membrane association. Furthermore, the genomic structure of Brk is quite distinct from that of Src kinases, suggesting that Brk has diverged significantly from the Src kinases in evolution (7Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Shipley J. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Brk possesses sequences that are predicted to form Src homology 3 (SH3) and Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (1Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Martindale J.E. Kamalati T. Lowe P.N. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2383-2390PubMed Google Scholar). These domains bind to proline-rich sequences and to phosphotyrosine-containing sequences, respectively (8Pawson T.

The SH3 domain binds a polyproline type II helix in the linker region between the SH2 domain and the catalytic domain. The SH2 domain binds a sequence in the C-terminal tail that requires phosphorylation on Tyr-527 by c-Src kinase (Csk) (14Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). These intramolecular interactions stabilize an inactive (or “down-regulated”) conformation of the enzyme, and SH3 and SH2 ligands can potently activate Src kinases (15Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M.

First, the substrate specificity of the Brk catalytic domain has not been characterized (two proteins, BKS and Sam68, have been identified to date as Brk substrates (Refs. 23Mitchell P.J. Sara E.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4273-4282Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and24Derry J.J. Richard S. Valderrama Carvajal H., Ye, X. Vasioukhin V. Cochrane A.W. Chen T. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6114-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar)). Second, it is not clear whether the SH3 and SH2 domains of Brk function in an autoinhibitory manner. Brk possesses a tyrosine residue (Tyr-447) near the C terminus, but it is not known whether this site is phosphorylated or whether it is involved in Brk regulation. In Src family kinases, mutation of Tyr-527 (the analogous tyrosine) to Phe increases kinase activity, and expression of a Y527F mutant in fibroblasts leads to cell transformation (14Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Mutation of Tyr-447 to Phe decreased the ability of Brk to induce anchorage-independent growth, suggesting that Brk might be regulated in a different manner than Src kinases (3Kamalati T. Jolin H.E. Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Jackson L.E. Dean C.J. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30956-30963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to these results, a Y447F mutant of Sik appeared to have increased tyrosine kinase activity when overexpressed in mammalian cells (24Derry J.J. Richard S. Valderrama Carvajal H., Ye, X. Vasioukhin V. Cochrane A.W. Chen T. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6114-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). No purification of Brk kinase (or of any member of the Frk kinase family) has previously been carried out, and no structure-function studies have been reported to date. In this report, we have addressed several of these issues described above by mechanistic studies on the purified Brk protein. The cDNA for Brk was the kind gift of Dr. Mark Crompton (School of Biological Sciences, Royal Holloway, University of London, London, United Kingdom). PCR was used to amplify the Brk coding sequence. The oligonucleotides used for PCR were: 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGTGTCCCGGGACCAGGCTCACCTGGGCCCCAAG and 3′-CGCGAATTCGGTCGGGTTCTCGTAGCTGGTGAAGCTGGAGAGCCTC. The Brk DNA was then subcloned as a BamHI/EcoRI fragment into plasmid pFastBac HTb (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Stratagene QuikChange kit according to directions from the manufacturer. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. His-tagged wild-type Brk and mutant forms of Brk were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system (Invitrogen). For protein production, 0.6 liters of Sf9 cells were infected with high titer recombinant Brk baculovirus. After 3 days of infection, cells were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline two times. Sf9 cells were lysed two times in a French pressure cell in 50 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) containing protease inhibitors (5 mg/liter aprotinin, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 0.1 mm vanadate, and 1 mm EDTA. Cell lysate was diluted to 200 ml, centrifuged, and filtered. The lysate was then mixed with 40 ml of Macro-Prep High Q resin (Bio-Rad) that had previously been equilibrated in buffer A. After rocking at 4 °C for 1 h, the resin was washed with 100 ml of buffer A four times. Brk was then eluted from the High Q resin with 40 ml of buffer B (buffer A plus 1 m NaCl). The protein was then loaded onto a 3-ml column of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) that had been pre-equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with three column volumes of washing buffer (buffer B plus 0.01 m imidazole). Brk was eluted with buffer A containing 0.2 m imidazole. One-ml fractions were collected and assayed for tyrosine kinase activity using the spectrophotometric assay (see below). Active fractions were pooled and stored at 4 °C. Peptides were prepared by solid phase synthesis on an Applied Biosystems automated model 431A peptide synthesizer. The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-time of flight mass spectrometry. The sequences of the peptides used are: Src-specific substrate, Ala-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ile-Tyr-Gly-Glu-Phe-Glu-Ala-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys-Gly (22Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol.

Phosphotyrosine was incorporated into peptides usingNα-Fmoc-O-phospho-l-tyrosine (where Fmoc is (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl); Novabiochem). Brk kinase activity was measured by a continuous spectrophotometric assay (22Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 30 °C in 50 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3 mm MnCl2, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.28 mm NADH, 89 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 124 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. For experiments with autophosphorylated Brk, the enzyme was preincubated with 0.5 mm ATP for 20 min at 30 °C (22Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Initial rates were measured in triplicate, and kinetic parameters were determined by fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression analysis. Km values for ATP were determined using a range of ATP concentrations (1–1000 μm) and 600 μm Src peptide substrate.Km values for peptide were determined using a range of peptide concentrations (1–1000 μm) and 500 μm ATP. The activation constant,Kact, was determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the rates as a function of ligand concentration using Equation 1.va=Vact[L]/(Kact+[L])Equation 1 va is velocity measured in the presence of ligand minus the velocity measured in its absence,Vact is the maximal activated velocity minus the velocity measured in the absence of ligand, and [L] is the concentration of peptide (22Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The Kact value was determined using enzyme and varying concentrations of activator peptides (1–1000 μm). Kactdeterminations were performed using 500 μm ATP and 600 μm Src peptide substrate. Brk or Brk mutants (2 μm final concentration) were incubated with 0.5 mm [γ-32P] ATP (100–500cpm/pmol) in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3 mmMnCl2, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 30 °C for 20 min. In some experiments, Brk was pretreated with 0.5 mm unlabeled ATP in the same buffer for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by adding Laemmli buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. MALDI mass spectrometry was carried out at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute/Columbia University Protein Core Facility. 2 μg of Brk or autophosphorylated Brk was electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie staining. Brk bands were then excised from the gel; transferred to an acid-washed tube; rehydrated with water; crushed; washed three times for 20 min with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50% acetonitrile; dried; and incubated overnight at 32 °C with 0.67 ng/ml trypsin in 25 mm Tris (pH 8.5) to completely digest the protein. The tryptic fragments were then extracted with 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetate; dried; suspended in 10 mg/ml 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile plus 0.1% trifluoroacetate containing angiotensin as an internal standard; and applied to a MALDI sample plate, which was dried and washed with water to remove excess buffer salts. MALDI mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a PerSeptive Voyager DE-RP mass spectrometer in the linear mode. The masses obtained in the MALDI mass spectrometry experiments were searched against predicted tryptic fragments of Brk using the program PeptideMass (28Wilkins M.R. Lindskog I. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The pYEEI-resin was made by coupling the synthetic peptide Glu-Pro-Gln-Tyr(P)-Glu-Glu-Ile-Pro-Ile-Lys-Gln to 0.5 ml of Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) in 0.1 m MOPS buffer, pH 7.5 (29LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Pico A. Porter M. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32129-32134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Prior to use in an experiment, the pYEEI-resin was washed extensively with 0.1m MOPS. Binding reactions (final volume = 100 μl) were carried out by incubating 2 μg of Brk (or mutant Brk) with 30 μl of pYEEI-resin in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the pYEEI-resin was washed with the same buffer. Brk bound to the immobilized pYEEI peptide was eluted in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer and resolved using SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and detected with anti-Brk rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and an enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml amphotericin B. Cells were plated 24 h before transfection. The Brk expression plasmid was derived from pRCCMV and was a gift from Dr. Mark Crompton. Cell transfections were carried out using MIRUS TransIT (Mirus Corp.) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The cells were incubated with 5 μg of plasmid for 8 h before changing to normal growth medium. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. After harvesting and washing, 1 × 107 293 cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 140 mm NaCl) with protease inhibitors (5 mg/liter aprotinin, 5 mg/liter leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C and precleared by incubation with 15 μl of protein A beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation reactions, lysates were incubated with 1 μg of appropriate antibody and 15 μl of protein A beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane. Western blotting was carried out using anti-Brk antibody or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The immunoreactive proteins were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL. We produced a His-tagged version of full-length Brk (residues 1–451) using the Sf9/baculovirus expression system. For protein production, 0.6 liters of Sf9 cells were infected with high titer recombinant Brk baculovirus. Maximum Brk expression occurred after 3 days of infection. At this point, cells were harvested and lysed in a French pressure cell, and we purified Brk by successive chromatography on MacroPrep High Q anion exchange resin and a Ni-NTA column. The protein was greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining, and it migrated at a position consistent with the expected 52-kDa molecular mass (Fig.1). The purified protein has a high specific activity, as measured toward peptide substrates. Kinase assays were performed by two methods: (i) the phosphocellulose paper assay (30Casnellie J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and (ii) a coupled spectrophotometric assay (27Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the latter assay, the production of ADP is coupled to the oxidation of NADH, measured as a reduction in absorbance at 340 nm; this method has the advantage that it is a continuous assay. The two assays gave similar results, and the results shown in Table I are from the spectrophotometric assay. We first performed experiments with varying concentrations of ATP and at saturating amounts of peptide substrate to determine the Km for ATP. These experiments gave the following values: the Km for ATP = 83 μm and the Vmax = 37 nmol/min. We also found that Brk prefers manganese to magnesium as the divalent cation in the kinase reaction (data not shown).Table IPeptide phosphorylation by BrkPeptideVmaxKmkcat/Kmnmol/min/mgμmm−1min−1Src substrate37 ± 5105 ± 121.8 × 104Insulin receptor substrate26 ± 1.6540 ± 1032.5 × 103Abl substrate292 ± 21655 ± 842.3 × 104EGF receptor substrateNo phosphorylation1-aThe EGF receptor peptide gave no detectable phosphorylation in the spectrophotometric assay, indicating that the kcat/Km for this substrate is ≤50 m−1 min−1.Kinetic parameters were determined using the spectrophotometric assay.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic parameters were determined using the spectrophotometric assay. Determinations of Vmax, peptideKm, andkcat/Km were carried out at 1 μm enzyme and 500 μm ATP. The peptide/protein substrate specificity for Brk has not previously been investigated. We carried out experiments using four peptide substrates containing recognition motifs for different subfamilies of tyrosine kinases. Two of the peptides contain motifs that are preferred by nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (Src and Abl), and two peptides contain motifs that are preferred by receptor tyrosine kinases (EGF receptor and insulin receptor) (25Songyang Z. Carraway III, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Poner B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The results showed that the substrate specificity of Brk is more closely related to the specificity of Src and Abl. Of the substrates tested, the Src-specific synthetic peptide with the sequence Ala-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ile-Tyr-Gly-Glu-Phe-Glu-Ala-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys-Gly (22Porter M. Schindler T. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2721-2726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) had the lowest Km for Brk (105 μm). The Abl-specific substrate with the sequence Glu-Ala-Ile-Tyr-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-Ala-Lys-Lys-Lys-Gly had a 5-fold higherKm than the Src-specific peptide, but also displayed a much higher Vmax than any other peptide tested. In terms of kcat/Km, the Src and Abl peptides were phosphorylated more efficiently than the receptor tyrosine kinase substrates. The EGF receptor peptide with the sequence Ala-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Tyr-Phe-Glu-Leu-Val-Ala-Lys-Lys-Lys-Gly showed no significant phosphorylation by Brk, and the insulin receptor substrate, Lys-Lys-Glu-Glu-Glu-Glu-Tyr-Met-Met-Met-Met-Gly, was phosphorylated with a kcat/Kmvalue ∼6-fold lower than that of the Src peptide (Table I). The conserved architecture of protein kinase catalytic domains consists of a smaller N-terminal lobe that contacts ATP, and a larger C-terminal lobe that makes most of the contacts with protein substrate (31Taylor S.S. Radzio-Andzelm E. Structure. 1994; 2: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In many protein kinases, access to the active site is controlled by a flexible segment designated the activation loop (32Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar). For example, in Src kinases, the activation loop containing unphosphorylated Tyr-416 is positioned such that access of peptide substrates to the catalytic machinery is blocked (12Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of Tyr-416 increases the catalytic activity of the enzyme by causing the activation loop to move out of the substrate-binding site, thereby allowing access to substrates. Brk contains a tyrosine (Tyr-342) at a position within the kinase domain that could serve a similar function (1Mitchell P.J. Barker K.T. Martindale J.E. Kamalati T. Lowe P.N. Page M.J. Gusterson B.A. Crompton M.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2383-2390PubMed Google Scholar). We carried out experiments to test whether Brk is activated by autophosphorylation within the activation loop. First, we incubated Brk with [γ-32P]ATP and followed the reaction by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2). These experiments showed that Brk is capable of autophosphorylation. Preincubation of the enzyme with manganese and unlabeled ATP reduces the level of phosphate incorporation (Fig. 2). Because Brk contains a tyrosine near the C terminus (Tyr-447) that could play a role in intramolecular regulation, we carried out phosphorylation experiments in the presence of recombinant Csk, the enzyme that phosphorylates the C-terminal site in Src kinases. Csk did not catalyze significant phosphorylation of Brk in these experiments (data not shown). We carried out mass spectrometry experiments to identify autophosphorylation sites on Brk. We analyzed two samples: (i) Brk directly purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells; and (ii) Brk after an extended autophosphorylation reaction. The two samples were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, and the protein bands were reduced and alkylated with iodoacetamide, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry (Fig. 3). We focused on tryptic fragments of Brk that were found in the unphosphorylated state and that were shifted by the mass of a phosphate (+80 daltons) in the autophosphorylated sample. The major peak fitting these criteria (labeled a in Fig. 3) has a mass that corresponds to a peptide from the putative activation loop of Brk. This tryptic peptide contains two tyrosines (Tyr-342 and Tyr-351). Two other peaks (b and c in Fig. 2) correspond to alternate trypsin cleavage fragments containing Tyr-342 and Tyr-351. The sequence surrounding Tyr-342 is well conserved between Brk and the major autophosphorylation site in Src (Tyr-416). Tyr-351 is not conserved in Src (the corresponding residue is an Ile). Thus, Tyr-342 is likely to be the major site of autophosphorylation in Brk, although we cannot exclude the involvement of Tyr-351. We also observed three additional tryptic fragments (d, e, and f) that showed the +80 shift in mass upon autophosphorylation, although the peaks of phosphorylated peptides were smaller in these cases.

The main function of HLA class I molecules is to present peptide antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). Thus, without excluding alternative mechanisms (3Allen R.L. Bowness P. McMichael A.

This “arthritogenic peptide” hypothesis is supported by much indirect evidence, including the presence of both bacteria-specific and autoreactive CTL in patients with AS and ReA (7Hermann E., Yu, D.T.

These subtypes differ from disease-associated ones in only one (B*2705/B*2709) or two amino acid changes (B*2704/B*2706) located in the peptide-binding site and known to influence peptide specificity and T-cell recognition (16Marti M. Alvarez I. Lopez de Castro J.A. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 1999; 1: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, differential subtype association to AS suggests that peptide presentation by HLA-B27 may be critical for determining susceptibility to this and related diseases. Gram-negative bacteria, including species of Chlamydia, Salmonella, Yersinia, Shigella, and Campylobacter are known pathogenetic agents of ReA in humans (17Burmester G.R. Daser A. Kamradt T. Krause A. Mitchison N.A. Sieper J. Wolf N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 229-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In some cases, HLA-B27-restricted bacteria-specific epitopes triggering CTL responses in these patients have been identified (18Ugrinovic S. Mertz A., Wu, P. Braun J. Sieper J. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5715-5723PubMed Google Scholar). A bacterial component is also critical in the development of HLA-B27-associated arthritis in transgenic rodents (19Taurog J.D. Richardson J.A.

David C.S. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Following the observation that polymorphic regions of HLA-B27 had more homology to bacterial proteins than other HLA class I allotypes (22Scofield R.H. Warren W.L. Koelsch G. Harley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9330-9334Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and that the amino acid sequence of residues 168–176 in HLA-B27 had homology to protein sequences from Gram-negative bacteria (23Scofield R.H. Kurien B. Gross T. Warren W.L. Harley J.B. Lancet. 1995; 345: 1542-1544Abstract PubMed Google Scholar), it was proposed that presentation by HLA-B27 of peptides derived from its own molecule might lead to autoimmunity following bacterial infection through molecular mimicry between bacterial proteins and HLA-B27. Subsequent studies confirmed that an HLA-B27-derived peptide, closely related to the predicted one, B27-(169–179), was a natural ligand of HLA-B27 (24Boisgérault F. Tieng V. Stolzenberg M.C. Dulphy N. Khalil I. Tamouza R. Charron D. Toubert A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2764-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Garcia F. Marina A. Albar J.P. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, this peptide was abundant in the endogenous peptide pools from both disease-associated and non-associated subtypes, which questioned its pathogenetic relevance. More recently, an additional peptide from this region, B27-(169–181) was identified as a natural HLA-B27 ligand. The subtype distribution of this peptide correlated better, albeit incompletely, with subtype association to AS (26Alvarez I. Sesma L. Marcilla M. Ramos M. Martı́ M. Camafeita E. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32729-32737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we report that HLA-B27 constitutively binds in vivo a peptide derived from the cytoplasmic region of its own molecule that has significant homology with proteins from arthritogenic bacteria, specially Chlamydia. The HLA-B27-derived peptide is a natural ligand of three AS-associated subtypes analyzed, but not of the two subtypes not associated to this disease. The homologous chlamydial peptide bound in vitro three AS-associated subtypes as efficiently as the natural B27-derived ligand, and was directly produced from a synthetic precursor by the 20 S proteasome. HMy2.C1R (C1R) is a human lymphoid cell line with low expression of its endogenous class I antigens (27Storkus W.J. Howell D.N. Salter R.D. Dawson J.R. Cresswell P. J.

B*2702, B*2704, B*2705, and B*2706-C1R transfectant cells were described elsewhere (29Calvo V. Rojo S. Lopez D. Galocha B. Lopez de Castro J.A. J.

Tissue Antigens. 1997; 49: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the B*2709-C1R transfectant cell line was made with a B*2709 genomic construction as previously described (29Calvo V. Rojo S. Lopez D. Galocha B. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 4038-4045PubMed Google Scholar). C1R cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum (both from Invitrogen). RMA-S is a TAP-deficient murine cell line (31Ljunggren H.G.

Nature. 1989; 340: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). RMA-S transfectant cells expressing B*2702, B*2704, B*2705, and B*2706 and human β2m have been previously described (33Villadangos J.A. Galocha B. Lopez de Castro J.A. J.

Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The mAb used in this study were W6/32 (IgG2a, specific for a monomorphic HLA-A, B, C determinant) (35Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. Brown G. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams A.F. Ziegler A. Cell. 1978; 14: 9-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar) and ME1 (IgG1, specific for HLA-B27, B7, Bw22) (36Ellis S.A. Taylor C. McMichael A. Hum. Immunol. 1982; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Isolation of HLA-B27-bound peptides was done as previously described (37Paradela A. Garcia-Peydro M. Vazquez J. Rognan D. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 5481-5490PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, about 1 × 1010 HLA-B27 transfectant cells were lysed at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (pH 7.5) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors. After centrifugation, cell lysates were subjected to affinity chromatography using the W6/32 mAb. HLA-B27-bound peptides were eluted with 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid at room temperature, filtered through Centricon 3 (Amicon, Beverly, MA), and concentrated to 100 μl for HPLC fractionation. This was done in a Waters Alliance system (Waters, Milford, MA), using a Vydac C18 (0.21 × 25 cm) 5-μm particle size column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA), at a flow rate of 100 μl/min, as follows: isocratic conditions with buffer A (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid in water) for 15 min, followed by a linear gradient of 0–44% buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid in water) for 90 min and a linear gradient of 44–100% buffer B for another 35 min. Peptide fractionation was simultaneously monitored at 210 and 280 nm. Fractions of 50 μl were collected and stored at −20 °C. The peptide composition of HPLC fractions was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS using a calibrated Kompact Probe instrument (Kratos-Schimadzu) operating in the positive linear mode, as previously described (38Paradela A. Alvarez I. Garcia-Peydro M. Sesma L. Ramos M. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Dried fractions were resuspended in 5 μl of methanol/water (1:1) containing 0.1% formic acid, and a 0.5-μl aliquot of the sample was deposited onto the stainless steel MALDI probe and allowed to dry at room temperature. Then 0.5 μl of matrix solution (saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 33% aqueous acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) were added and again allowed to dry at room temperature. Peptide sequencing was carried out by quadrupole ion trap nanoelectrospray MS/MS in an LCQ instrument (Finnigan ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA), exactly as detailed elsewhere (39Yague J. Vazquez J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1998; 52: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 40Marina A. Garcia M.A. Albar J.P. Yague J. Lopez de Castro J.A. Vazquez J. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In some cases, PSD-MALDI-TOF MS sequencing was carried out as previously described (26Alvarez I. Sesma L. Marcilla M. Ramos M. Martı́ M. Camafeita E. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32729-32737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A first search was made with the B27-(309–320) sequence with the prokaryotic non-redundant protein data base, using the Smith-Waterman protein searcher application on Bioccelerator in the European Molecular Biology Laboratory server (Bioccelerator: eta.embl-heidelberg.de:8000/), using default settings. A second search was made with the same B27-derived sequence against the individual protein databases of Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae,Campylobacter jejuni, and Salmonella typhimurium, using the BlastP program at the Entrez server of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/Entrez/genom_table_cgi). The search was made using no filters, an expect value of 10,000, and default settings for other parameters. These were obtained using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry, and purified by HPLC. The correct molecular mass of purified peptides was established by MALDI-TOF MS, and their correct composition and quantification by amino acid analysis after hydrolysis in 6 m HCL using a 6300 Amino Acid Analyser (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA). The epitope stabilization assay used to measure peptide binding was performed as described (34Galocha B. Lamas J.R. Villadangos J.A. Albar J.P. Lopez de Castro J.A. Tissue Antigens. 1996; 48: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, B27 RMA-S transfectants were incubated at 26 °C for 22 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. They were then washed three times in AIM-V serum-free medium (Invitrogen), incubated for 1 h at 26 °C with various peptide concentrations in the same medium, transferred to 37 °C, and collected for flow cytometry after 2 h for B*2702 and B*2704 transfectants or 4 h for B*2705 and B*2706 transfectants. HLA-B27 expression was measured using 50 μl of hybridoma culture supernatant containing the mAb ME1. Binding of a natural HLA-B27 ligand, used as reference peptide, was expressed as C50, which is the molar concentration of the peptide at 50% of the maximum fluorescence obtained at the concentration range used (0.01–100 μm). Binding of other peptides was expressed as the peptide concentration required to obtain the fluorescence value at the C50 of the reference peptide. This was designated as EC50. EC50 values of up to 10 μm are typical of many natural ligands. Values between 10 and 50 μm were considered to reflect intermediate affinity. These values are obtained for some natural ligands, but many of the peptides binding in this range are not foundin vivo. EC50 values of >50 μmreflect low affinity. The 20 S proteasome was purified from B*2705-C1R cell lysates by ion-exchange chromatography and centrifugation in a glycerol gradient as previously described (26Alvarez I. Sesma L. Marcilla M. Ramos M. Martı́ M. Camafeita E. Lopez de Castro J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32729-32737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These preparations consisted of a mixture of 20 S proteasome and immunoproteasome, as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis (data not shown). Peptide substrates were incubated at 37 °C and 125 μg/ml with purified 20 S proteasome at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:10 (w/w) in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.6. Digestion was stopped by adding 1/5 volume of 0.4% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Digestion mixtures were dried down to 100 μl in a SpeedVac and fractionated by HPLC using the same conditions as for HLA-B27-bound peptides. Individual digestion products were identified on the basis of their molecular mass by MALDI-TOF MS and, when necessary for unambiguous assignment, by PSD-MALDI-TOF MS sequencing. The HLA-B27-derived dodecamer ligand B27-(309–320) and a homologous peptide from C. trachomatiswith the same length, DNA primase (211–222), were modeled in the binding groove of HLA-B*2705, whose x-ray structure in complex with a model peptide (Protein Data Bank entry 1hsa) had previously been solved at a resolution of 2.1 Å (41Madden D.R. Gorga J.C. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1992; 70: 1035-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Peptides were built in the peptide-binding site as previously described (42Rognan D. Lauemoller S.L. Holm A. Buus S. Tschinke V. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4650-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Briefly backbone coordinates of positions P1, P2, P3, PC-1, and PC (Pc being the C-terminal peptide residue) as well as both charged termini were first kept constant and identical to that of the 1hsa crystal structure. Rotameric states of side chains at the above-described positions were then assigned by searching an in-house three-dimensional data base of 37 x-ray structures of class I MHC-bound peptides. Last, the central loop (P4 to PC-2) bulging out of the binding groove was constructed using a knowledge-based loop search procedure using the LOOPSEARCH module of the SYBYL package (TRIPOS Inc, St. Louis, MO). In this procedure, a set of 1478 high-resolution x-ray structures were searched for a loop of similar length (7 amino acids) and presenting a similar distance between Cα atoms of the residues delimiting the loop window. The loop showing the highest homology and the lowest root-mean-square deviations was further selected for insertion. After adding all hydrogen atoms and quick steepest descent AMBER5 minimization (43Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz J.R. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.M. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar) of the whole complex, the loop was annealed for 50 ps at 1000 K and cooled down to 50 K for another 50 ps. The last simulated annealing conformer was finally relaxed again by 100 steps steepest descent minimization. The B*2705-bound peptide pool was isolated from B*2705-C1R transfectant cells and fractionated by HPLC. When analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, HPLC fraction N. 92 showed a main ion peak at mass/charge (m/z) 1239.63 (Fig.1 A). This peptide was fragmented by nanoelectrospray ion trap MS/MS. The corresponding spectrum (Fig. 1 B) was consistent with the sequence of a dodecamer, RRKSSGGKGGSY, corresponding to HLA-B27 residues 309–320. This assignment was confirmed by showing that the MS/MS spectrum of the synthetic dodecamer was essentially identical to the B27-derived natural ligand (Fig. 1 C). The yield of this peptide was estimated on the basis of the intensity of the ion peak in the MALDI-TOF MS spectrum (Fig. 1 A), after calibration with serial dilutions of the corresponding synthetic peptide. The value obtained was in the range of 28–56 pmol/1010cell-equivalents or 1700–3400 molecules/cell. These results demonstrate that HLA-B*2705 binds a natural ligand derived from the cytoplasmic region of its own molecule. This sequence is conserved among HLA-B molecules, but is different in HLA-A and HLA-C. The sequence in HLA-C differs only by a Y320C change. The B27-(309–320) peptide was searched in the endogenous peptide pools from two other HLA-B27 subtypes associated to AS, B*2702 and B*2704, and from the two subtypes not or weakly associated to this disease, B*2706 and B*2709. These are structurally closest to B*2704 and B*2705, respectively. Comparative HPLC analysis of B*2705- and B*2709-bound peptide pools revealed that the prominent absorbance peak at fraction N. 92 lacked a counterpart in B*2709 (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, comparison of B*2704- and B*2706-bound peptide pools revealed a prominent peak at HPLC fraction N.92 from B*2704 and a much smaller peak from B*2706 at the same retention time (Fig. 2 B). An absorbance peak was also observed at the corresponding fraction from B*2702 (Fig. 2 C). MALDI-TOF MS analysis of these HPLC fractions showed ion peaks at m/z 1239.9, corresponding to B27-(309–320) in B*2702 and B*2704 (Fig.3). This was formally confirmed by postsource decay (PSD)-MALDI-TOF sequencing of the peptide from B*2704 (not shown). The MALDI-TOF MS spectra of the corresponding HPLC fractions from B*2706 and B*2709 (Fig. 3), as well as the two previous and two following ones (not shown), failed to show this ion peak, although in B*2706 unrelated ion peaks were detected. These results indicate that for five HLA-B27 subtypes analyzed constitutive binding of the B27-(309–320) peptide in vivo correlates with subtype association to AS.Figure 3MALDI-TOF MS spectra of HPLC fractions N. 92 of the B*2702-, B*2704-, B*2706-, and B*2709-bound peptide pools.The ion peak at m/z 1239.9, corresponding to B27-(309–320), is observed in B*2702 and B*2704, but not in B*2706 or B*2709.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because of the pathogenetic role of various Gram-negative bacteria in ReA, B27-(309–320) was compared with proteins from arthritogenic micro-organisms, to investigate the possibility of molecular mimicry. Initially, the B27-(309–320) sequence was screened for homology against prokaryotic protein sequences. In a second step, the same sequence was screened against the protein data bases from C. trachomatis,C. pneumoniae,Chlamydia muridarum, C. jejuni, andS. typhimurium. In these analyses the best matches with sequences containing the canonic HLA-B27-binding motifs Arg2 and basic, aliphatic, or aromatic C-terminal residues, corresponded to 4 sequences from the DNA primase and GTP-binding proteins of C. muridarum,C. trachomatis, andC. pneumoniae, 6 sequences from unrelated proteins ofS. typhimurium, and one sequence from C. jejuni(Table I). Thus, B27-(309–320) has significant homology with protein sequences from several arthritogenic bacteria, most strikingly with a region of the DNA primase fromChlamydia.Table IPeptides from arthritogenic bacteria with homology to B27(309–320)Sequence1-aResidues in bacterial peptides identical to HLA-B27(309–320) are in boldface.

Binding to B*2709 was not tested because the corresponding RMA-S transfectant was not available. B27-(309–320) bound efficiently B*2705 (EC50 = 2 μm), B*2702 (EC50 = 5 μm), and B*2704 (EC50 = 5 μm), which correlates with the binding specificity of this peptide in vivo. It bound also B*2706 (EC50 = 12 μm), but more weakly than a natural B*2706 ligand (RRYQKSTEL) used as positive control (Fig.4, Table II).Table IIBinding efficiency of synthetic peptides to HLA-B27 subtypesPeptideSequenceEC50 ± SD2-aEC50 is defined in “Materials and Methods.” Data are means ± S.D. of 3 or 4 independent experiments.B2705B2702B2704B2706μmNatural B*2706 ligandRRYQKSTEL—2-b—, not done.——3 ± 3B27 (309–320)RRKSSGGKGGSY2 ± 15 ± 35 ± 2.512 ± 4C. trachomatis DNA primase (211–222)RRFKEGGRGGKY1 ± 17 ± 45 ± 140 ± 27C. trachomatis GTP-binding protein (169–180)SRQKSGGSGGGF47/>1002-cWhen the EC50 of individual experiments was >100 μm the mean was not calculated and the maximal and minimal EC50 values are shown.—Not bound35 ± 15C. pneumoniae GTP-binding protein (169–180)SRQKSGGGSGGF44/>1002-cWhen the EC50 of individual experiments was >100 μm the mean was not calculated and the maximal and minimal EC50 values are shown.—Not bound15 ± 9Negative controlKTGGPIYKRNot boundNot boundNot boundNot bound2-a EC50 is defined in “Materials and Methods.” Data are means ± S.D. of 3 or 4 independent experiments.2-b —, not done.2-c When the EC50 of individual experiments was >100 μm the mean was not calculated and the maximal and minimal EC50 values are shown.

These results suggest that this peptide, if generated in Chlamydia-infected cells, could be presented as a natural ligand of B*2702, B*2704, and B*2705, but not B*2706. The peptides derived from the chlamydial GTP-binding protein bound the B27 subtypes tested with intermediate or low affinity, suggesting that these peptides are less likely to be presented by HLA-B27 in vivo. Since DNA primase (211–222) from C. trachomatis was a possible natural ligand of HLA-B27, we tested whether this peptide could be generated by proteasomal cleavagein vitro. Thus, a synthetic 28-mer with the sequence of theC. trachomatis DNA primase residues 203–230 was digested by the 20 S proteasome. The digestion mixture was fractionated by HPLC, and individual digestion products were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and/or MS/MS sequencing (Fig. 5). Their yield was estimated on the basis of their absorbance at 210 nm, normalized to take into account peptidic length differences. When various peptides co-el"

Employing fibroblasts derived from E9.5junB −/− mouse embryos we provide evidence for a novel cell cycle promoting role of JunB. Despite a normal proliferation rate, primary and immortalizedjunB −/− fibroblasts exhibited an altered cell cycle profile, which was characterized by an increase in the population of S-phase cells, while that of cells in G2/M-phase was diminished. This delay in G2/M-transition is caused by impaired cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin B-CDC2 kinase activities and counteracts the accelerated S-phase entry. Cells lacking JunB show severely delayed kinetics of cyclin A mRNA expression due to the loss of proper transcriptional activation mediated via binding of JunB to the CRE element in the cyclin A promoter. Upon reintroduction of an inducible JunB-ERTM expression vector the cell cycle distribution and the cell cycle-associated cyclin A-CDK2 kinase activity could be restored. Thus, cyclin A is a direct transcriptional target of JunB driving cell proliferation.

Despite a normal proliferation rate, primary and immortalizedjunB −/− fibroblasts exhibited an altered cell cycle profile, which was characterized by an increase in the population of S-phase cells, while that of cells in G2/M-phase was diminished. This delay in G2/M-transition is caused by impaired cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin B-CDC2 kinase activities and counteracts the accelerated S-phase entry. Cells lacking JunB show severely delayed kinetics of cyclin A mRNA expression due to the loss of proper transcriptional activation mediated via binding of JunB to the CRE element in the cyclin A promoter. Upon reintroduction of an inducible JunB-ERTM expression vector the cell cycle distribution and the cell cycle-associated cyclin A-CDK2 kinase activity could be restored. Thus, cyclin A is a direct transcriptional target of JunB driving cell proliferation. cyclin-dependent kinase activator protein-1 cell cycle-dependent element cell cylce gene homology region CDE-CHR binding factor cyclin A CHR binding factor cyclic AMP response element cAMP-response element-binding protein mouse embryo fibroblast human embryonic kidney cells hormone binding domain of the human estrogen receptor fluorescence-activated cell sorter 5-bromodeoxyuridine electrophoretic mobility shift assay TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate)-responsive element reverse transcriptase wild type Eukaryotic cells have developed precise and well regulated mechanisms to control progression through the cell cycle. The tight control is mediated by the interplay of sequentially activated and inactivated protein kinase complexes known as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).1 CDK activity is controlled by the expression levels of their respective cyclin partners acting as positive coactivators and by negative regulators, the so-called CDK inhibitors (1Sherr C.J.

However, the mechanism by which the pocket proteins affect cyclin A gene expression is still a matter of controversial discussion.

While the AP-1 and p53 sites are most likely not functional (17Desdouets C. Matesic G. Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Brechot C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Mol. Cell.

Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Brechot C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3301-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the CRE acts in concert with the CDE site to properly regulate cyclin A expression (23Zwicker J. Muller R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Sylvester A.M. Chen D. Krasinski K. Andres V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Transcription factors binding to the CRE are CREB and ATF-2. ATF-2 that is necessary for the maximal activity and serum induction of the cyclin A promoter in chondrocytes (25Beier F. Taylor A.C. LuValle P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12948-12953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) is a member of the AP-1 transcription factor. AP-1 represents a heterogenous set of dimeric proteins consisting of the Jun, Fos, and ATF families. Signals affecting AP-1 activity include growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, carcinogens, and specific oncogenes (for reviews, see Refs. 26Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar and 27Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). Different lines of evidence have shown that AP-1 is critically involved in cell proliferation (28Kovary K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4466-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 29Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). A causal link between AP-1-dependent signaling and cell cycle regulation was provided by the analysis of c-Jun null fibroblasts, revealing several p53-dependent molecular defects in the G1- to S-phase transition (30Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and cell cycle re-entry of UV-irradiated cells (31Shaulian E. Schreiber M. Piu F. Beeche M. Wagner E.F. Karin M. Cell. 2000; 103: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While c-Jun has cell cycle promoting functions by repressing p53 and activating the cyclin D1 promoter, antagonistic functions have been assigned to JunB. At the G1- to S-transition JunB acts as a repressor through inhibition the cyclin D1 promoter (32Bakiri L. Lallemand D. Bossy-Wetzel E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and via p16INK4a that has been identified as a transcriptional target of JunB (33Passegue E. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).To assess the consequences of JunB ablation in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, we isolated fibroblasts from JunB-deficient E9.5 embryos just prior to death due to placental insufficiency (34Schorpp-Kistner M. Wang Z.Q. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 934-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and generated spontaneously immortalized 3T3 fibroblast cell lines. In addition to the previously described negative function of JunB at the G1- to S-transition our work identifies a novel critical positive role for JunB in cell cycle progression at the S- to G2/M-phase as transcriptional activator of cyclin A and subsequently of the kinase activity of cyclin A-CDK2.DISCUSSIONHere, we demonstrate that JunB, which so far has been considered to be a negative regulator of AP-1 (46Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 47Schutte J. Viallet J. Nau M. Segal S. Fedorko J. Minna J. Cell. 1989; 59: 987-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 48Deng T. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and of the G1- to S-transition (32Bakiri L. Lallemand D. Bossy-Wetzel E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 33Passegue E. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), has an additional, yet unrecognized, positive role in cell cycle regulation. Fibroblasts with a targeted null mutation in the junB gene exhibited a delayed entry into G2/M-phases, thereby compensating the expected accelerated G1- to S-transition resulting in an overall normal proliferation rate.The increased G1-acceleration function of cyclin D1-CDK4/CDK6 and the loss of the growth suppressor p16INK4aas a result of JunB ablation did not result in enhanced proliferation as one may have expected based on results obtained from cyclin D1 overexpression (49Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 50Jiang W. Kahn S.M. Zhou P. Zhang Y.J. Cacace A.M. Infante A.S. Doi S. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3447-3457PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, JunB-deficient fibroblasts exhibited overall normal cell proliferation behavior suggesting an additional impairment of a JunB-dependent function compensating for the accelerated G1- to S-transition. Indeed, delayed maximal kinase activities for both S to G2/M regulators, cyclin A-CDK2 as well as cyclin B-CDC2, were observed injunB−/− fibroblasts, which could account for this compensatory effect. The progression through S-phase toward the G2/M-phase is mainly regulated via the activity of cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin B-CDC2 (5Furuno N. den Elzen N. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Desdouets C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Murphy M. Brechot C. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1995; 1: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In line with these data the impaired kinase activities in JunB-deficient cells can be explained by the reduced and decelerated cyclin A protein levels, which, in turn, also affect the activation and nuclear translocation of the downstream cyclin B-CDC2 complex (5Furuno N. den Elzen N. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).One could assume that impaired activation of cyclin A-CDK2 is due to a premature entry of JunB-deficient fibroblasts into S-phase without having the appropriate substrates for DNA synthesis present. Unfortunately, no tool is currently available to dissect the two phenotypes, the accelerated G1- transition that is accompanied by elevated cyclin D1 and c-Jun levels from the delay in S-phase progression. Previous studies have shown that accelerated G1- to S-transition caused by cyclin D1 overexpression results in a shortened generation time, yet without a compensatory prolongation of the DNA replicative phase (49Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 50Jiang W. Kahn S.M. Zhou P. Zhang Y.J. Cacace A.M. Infante A.S. Doi S. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3447-3457PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of c-Jun produces larger S/G2- and M-phase populations (29Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In light of these studies, the decelerated S- to G2/M-transition of JunB-deficient fibroblasts is either due to the prolonged transcriptional activation of c-jun injunB−/− cells (42Andrecht, S., Identification of Positive and Negative Functions of the Transcription Factor JunB in Cell Cycle Regulation.Ph.D. thesis, 2001, University Hanover, Hanover, Germany.Google Scholar, 51Passegue E. Jochum W. Schorpp-Kistner M. Mohle-Steinlein U. Wagner E.F. Cell. 2001; 104: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) or to a second, c-Jun-independent event. There are several arguments that favor the existence of modulators of the cell cycle machinery, which are exclusively controlled by JunB. We propose that the loss of JunB causes an impairment of the strict cell cycle-dependent regulation of cyclin A. Even in the presence of enhanced c-Jun and cyclin D1 levels and increased cyclin D1-CDK4/CDK6 kinase activity, which should result in a cyclin A activation, the levels of cyclin A were found to be reduced.Previous studies have shown that the inducibility of the cyclin A promoter during the short window between late G1- and G1/S-phase is initiated by the cAMP signaling pathway leading to ATF-2 and CREB activation (17Desdouets C. Matesic G. Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Brechot C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3301-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of protein kinase A with a specific inhibitor reduced cyclin A mRNA accumulation in late G1 and delayed S-phase entry, demonstrating the involvement of PKA in this pathway (17Desdouets C. Matesic G. Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Brechot C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3301-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Independent reports have demonstrated that Jun/ATF heterodimers are involved in this regulation. In chondrocytes of ATF-2-deficient mice, the transcriptional regulation of cyclin A is severely impaired (25Beier F. Taylor A.C. LuValle P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12948-12953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The rat cyclin A promoter is primarily regulated by ATF and Jun proteins, predominantly JunD, binding to the CRE element (52Shimizu M. Nomura Y. Suzuki H. Ichikawa E. Takeuchi A. Suzuki M. Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Oda K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However,junD−/− cells show neither a cell cycle defect nor an alteration in cyclin A regulation (53Weitzman J.B. Fiette L. Matsuo K. Yaniv M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1109-1119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), suggesting that JunD either does not play a decisive role in cyclin A regulation or that it may be functionally compensated by other AP-1 members, most likely JunB. JunB is the only Jun member that is strongly activated by the cAMP-dependent PKA signal pathway (54de Groot R.P. Auwerx J. Karperien M. Staels B. Kruijer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The in vitro binding studies and the impairment of cyclin A transcriptional activation presented in this report strongly underline that JunB is a major component in the regulation of the cyclin A promoter. Moreover, data obtained from the coexpression studies provide functional evidence that JunB, together with ATF-2, is able to transactivate the cyclin A promoter in a CRE-dependent manner. The reconstitution of proper cyclin A expression and activation, upon reintroduction of a post-translationally inducible JunB-ERTM protein, the in vitro binding studies as well as transient transfection analysis have identified cyclin A, in addition to proliferin, MMP-9 (34Schorpp-Kistner M. Wang Z.Q. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 934-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and p16INK4a (33Passegue E. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), as one of the very few so far characterized positively regulated JunB target genes. Interestingly, an identical CRE element is implicated in the positive regulation of both cyclin D1 and cyclin A genes. The precise timing of their expression in the cell cycle thus appears to rely on their ability to bind different transcription factors. c-Jun/ATF heterodimers are responsible for cyclin D1 activation (32Bakiri L. Lallemand D. Bossy-Wetzel E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), while the JunB seems to be needed for its repression (Ref. 32Bakiri L. Lallemand D. Bossy-Wetzel E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar and our own results). By contrast, the cAMP-induced signaling pathway exerts a stimulatory effect on cyclin A (17Desdouets C. Matesic G. Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Brechot C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3301-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and an inhibitory effect on cyclin D1 expression (55Sewing A. Burger C. Brusselbach S. Schalk C. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 545-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that a fine-tuned cell cycle-regulated adjustment of the ratio between c-Jun and JunB proteins may represent one of the decisive components.We demonstrate that JunB has unique functions in cell cycle regulation, which cannot be compensated by other AP-1 members. Moreover, it confirms the coexistence of previously suggested opposite functions of JunB as transcriptional repressor and activator (46Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) that is required for one and the same process, namely cell cycle progression (Fig.7). Our findings provide another example for the increasing complexity of positive and negative interactions among the individual AP-1 subunits embedded in a complex circuitry network. Eukaryotic cells have developed precise and well regulated mechanisms to control progression through the cell cycle. The tight control is mediated by the interplay of sequentially activated and inactivated protein kinase complexes known as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).1 CDK activity is controlled by the expression levels of their respective cyclin partners acting as positive coactivators and by negative regulators, the so-called CDK inhibitors (1Sherr C.J.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar), and cyclin B-CDC2 appears to be only necessary for the entry into mitosis (5Furuno N. den Elzen N. Pines J. J.

Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar).

While the AP-1 and p53 sites are most likely not functional (17Desdouets C. Matesic G. Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Brechot C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Mol. Cell.

Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Brechot C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3301-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the CRE acts in concert with the CDE site to properly regulate cyclin A expression (23Zwicker J. Muller R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Sylvester A.M. Chen D. Krasinski K. Andres V. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Transcription factors binding to the CRE are CREB and ATF-2. ATF-2 that is necessary for the maximal activity and serum induction of the cyclin A promoter in chondrocytes (25Beier F. Taylor A.C. LuValle P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12948-12953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) is a member of the AP-1 transcription factor. AP-1 represents a heterogenous set of dimeric proteins consisting of the Jun, Fos, and ATF families. Signals affecting AP-1 activity include growth factors, cytokines, tumor promoters, carcinogens, and specific oncogenes (for reviews, see Refs. 26Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3248) Google Scholar and 27Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). Different lines of evidence have shown that AP-1 is critically involved in cell proliferation (28Kovary K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4466-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 29Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). A causal link between AP-1-dependent signaling and cell cycle regulation was provided by the analysis of c-Jun null fibroblasts, revealing several p53-dependent molecular defects in the G1- to S-phase transition (30Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and cell cycle re-entry of UV-irradiated cells (31Shaulian E. Schreiber M. Piu F. Beeche M. Wagner E.F. Karin M. Cell. 2000; 103: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While c-Jun has cell cycle promoting functions by repressing p53 and activating the cyclin D1 promoter, antagonistic functions have been assigned to JunB. At the G1- to S-transition JunB acts as a repressor through inhibition the cyclin D1 promoter (32Bakiri L. Lallemand D. Bossy-Wetzel E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and via p16INK4a that has been identified as a transcriptional target of JunB (33Passegue E. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To assess the consequences of JunB ablation in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, we isolated fibroblasts from JunB-deficient E9.5 embryos just prior to death due to placental insufficiency (34Schorpp-Kistner M. Wang Z.Q. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 934-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and generated spontaneously immortalized 3T3 fibroblast cell lines. In addition to the previously described negative function of JunB at the G1- to S-transition our work identifies a novel critical positive role for JunB in cell cycle progression at the S- to G2/M-phase as transcriptional activator of cyclin A and subsequently of the kinase activity of cyclin A-CDK2. DISCUSSIONHere, we demonstrate that JunB, which so far has been considered to be a negative regulator of AP-1 (46Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 47Schutte J. Viallet J. Nau M. Segal S. Fedorko J. Minna J. Cell. 1989; 59: 987-997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 48Deng T. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and of the G1- to S-transition (32Bakiri L. Lallemand D. Bossy-Wetzel E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 33Passegue E. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), has an additional, yet unrecognized, positive role in cell cycle regulation. Fibroblasts with a targeted null mutation in the junB gene exhibited a delayed entry into G2/M-phases, thereby compensating the expected accelerated G1- to S-transition resulting in an overall normal proliferation rate.The increased G1-acceleration function of cyclin D1-CDK4/CDK6 and the loss of the growth suppressor p16INK4aas a result of JunB ablation did not result in enhanced proliferation as one may have expected based on results obtained from cyclin D1 overexpression (49Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 50Jiang W. Kahn S.M. Zhou P. Zhang Y.J. Cacace A.M. Infante A.S. Doi S. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3447-3457PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, JunB-deficient fibroblasts exhibited overall normal cell proliferation behavior suggesting an additional impairment of a JunB-dependent function compensating for the accelerated G1- to S-transition. Indeed, delayed maximal kinase activities for both S to G2/M regulators, cyclin A-CDK2 as well as cyclin B-CDC2, were observed injunB−/− fibroblasts, which could account for this compensatory effect. The progression through S-phase toward the G2/M-phase is mainly regulated via the activity of cyclin A-CDK2 and cyclin B-CDC2 (5Furuno N. den Elzen N. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Desdouets C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Murphy M. Brechot C. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1995; 1: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In line with these data the impaired kinase activities in JunB-deficient cells can be explained by the reduced and decelerated cyclin A protein levels, which, in turn, also affect the activation and nuclear translocation of the downstream cyclin B-CDC2 complex (5Furuno N. den Elzen N. Pines J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar).One could assume that impaired activation of cyclin A-CDK2 is due to a premature entry of JunB-deficient fibroblasts into S-phase without having the appropriate substrates for DNA synthesis present. Unfortunately, no tool is currently available to dissect the two phenotypes, the accelerated G1- transition that is accompanied by elevated cyclin D1 and c-Jun levels from the delay in S-phase progression. Previous studies have shown that accelerated G1- to S-transition caused by cyclin D1 overexpression results in a shortened generation time, yet without a compensatory prolongation of the DNA replicative phase (49Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 50Jiang W. Kahn S.M. Zhou P. Zhang Y.J. Cacace A.M. Infante A.S. Doi S. Santella R.M. Weinstein I.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3447-3457PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, overexpression of c-Jun produces larger S/G2- and M-phase populations (29Pfarr C.M. Mechta F. Spyrou G. Lallemand D. Carillo S. Yaniv M. Cell. 1994; 76: 747-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In light of these studies, the decelerated S- to G2/M-transition of JunB-deficient fibroblasts is either due to the prolonged transcriptional activation of c-jun injunB−/− cells (42Andrecht, S., Identification of Positive and Negative Functions of the Transcription Factor JunB in Cell Cycle Regulation.Ph.D. thesis, 2001, University Hanover, Hanover, Germany.Google Scholar, 51Passegue E. Jochum W. Schorpp-Kistner M. Mohle-Steinlein U. Wagner E.F. Cell. 2001; 104: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) or to a second, c-Jun-independent event. There are several arguments that favor the existence of modulators of the cell cycle machinery, which are exclusively controlled by JunB. We propose that the loss of JunB causes an impairment of the strict cell cycle-dependent regulation of cyclin A. Even in the presence of enhanced c-Jun and cyclin D1 levels and increased cyclin D1-CDK4/CDK6 kinase activity, which should result in a cyclin A activation, the levels of cyclin A were found to be reduced.Previous studies have shown that the inducibility of the cyclin A promoter during the short window between late G1- and G1/S-phase is initiated by the cAMP signaling pathway leading to ATF-2 and CREB activation (17Desdouets C. Matesic G. Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Brechot C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3301-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of protein kinase A with a specific inhibitor reduced cyclin A mRNA accumulation in late G1 and delayed S-phase entry, demonstrating the involvement of PKA in this pathway (17Desdouets C. Matesic G. Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Brechot C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3301-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Independent reports have demonstrated that Jun/ATF heterodimers are involved in this regulation. In chondrocytes of ATF-2-deficient mice, the transcriptional regulation of cyclin A is severely impaired (25Beier F. Taylor A.C. LuValle P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12948-12953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The rat cyclin A promoter is primarily regulated by ATF and Jun proteins, predominantly JunD, binding to the CRE element (52Shimizu M. Nomura Y. Suzuki H. Ichikawa E. Takeuchi A. Suzuki M. Nakamura T. Nakajima T. Oda K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However,junD−/− cells show neither a cell cycle defect nor an alteration in cyclin A regulation (53Weitzman J.B. Fiette L. Matsuo K. Yaniv M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1109-1119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), suggesting that JunD either does not play a decisive role in cyclin A regulation or that it may be functionally compensated by other AP-1 members, most likely JunB. JunB is the only Jun member that is strongly activated by the cAMP-dependent PKA signal pathway (54de Groot R.P. Auwerx J. Karperien M. Staels B. Kruijer W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The in vitro binding studies and the impairment of cyclin A transcriptional activation presented in this report strongly underline that JunB is a major component in the regulation of the cyclin A promoter. Moreover, data obtained from the coexpression studies provide functional evidence that JunB, together with ATF-2, is able to transactivate the cyclin A promoter in a CRE-dependent manner. The reconstitution of proper cyclin A expression and activation, upon reintroduction of a post-translationally inducible JunB-ERTM protein, the in vitro binding studies as well as transient transfection analysis have identified cyclin A, in addition to proliferin, MMP-9 (34Schorpp-Kistner M. Wang Z.Q. Angel P. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 934-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and p16INK4a (33Passegue E. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), as one of the very few so far characterized positively regulated JunB target genes. Interestingly, an identical CRE element is implicated in the positive regulation of both cyclin D1 and cyclin A genes. The precise timing of their expression in the cell cycle thus appears to rely on their ability to bind different transcription factors. c-Jun/ATF heterodimers are responsible for cyclin D1 activation (32Bakiri L. Lallemand D. Bossy-Wetzel E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), while the JunB seems to be needed for its repression (Ref. 32Bakiri L. Lallemand D. Bossy-Wetzel E. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2056-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar and our own results). By contrast, the cAMP-induced signaling pathway exerts a stimulatory effect on cyclin A (17Desdouets C. Matesic G. Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Sassone-Corsi P. Brechot C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3301-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and an inhibitory effect on cyclin D1 expression (55Sewing A. Burger C. Brusselbach S. Schalk C. Lucibello F.C. Muller R. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 545-555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that a fine-tuned cell cycle-regulated adjustment of the ratio between c-Jun and JunB proteins may represent one of the decisive components.We demonstrate that JunB has unique functions in cell cycle regulation, which cannot be compensated by other AP-1 members. Moreover, it confirms the coexistence of previously suggested opposite functions of JunB as transcriptional repressor and activator (46Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) that is required for one and the same process, namely cell cycle progression (Fig.7). Our findings provide another example for the increasing complexity of positive and negative interactions among the individual AP-1 subunits embedded in a complex circuitry network. Here, we demonstrate that JunB, which so far has been considered to be a negative regulator of AP-1 (46Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M.

Ectopic expression of cyclin F arrests the cell cycle in G2/M. How the level of cyclin F is regulated during the cell cycle is completely obscure. Here we show that, similar to cyclin A, cyclin F is degraded when the spindle assembly checkpoint is activated and accumulates when the DNA damage checkpoint is activated. Cyclin F is a very unstable protein throughout much of the cell cycle. Unlike other cyclins, degradation of cyclin F is independent of ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated pathways. Interestingly, proteolysis of cyclin F is likely to involve metalloproteases. Rapid destruction of cyclin F does not require the N-terminal F-box motif but requires the COOH-terminal PEST sequences. The PEST region alone is sufficient to interfere with the degradation of cyclin F and confer instability when fused to cyclin A. These data show that although cyclin F is degraded at similar time as the mitotic cyclins, the underlying mechanisms are entirely distinct.

Interestingly, proteolysis of cyclin F is likely to involve metalloproteases. Rapid destruction of cyclin F does not require the N-terminal F-box motif but requires the COOH-terminal PEST sequences. The PEST region alone is sufficient to interfere with the degradation of cyclin F and confer instability when fused to cyclin A. These data show that although cyclin F is degraded at similar time as the mitotic cyclins, the underlying mechanisms are entirely distinct. Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; ADR, adriamycin; CMP, camptothecin; Ub, ubiquitin. are key regulators of the eukaryotic cell cycle. In mammalian cells, different cyclin-CDK complexes are involved in regulating different cell cycle transitions: cyclin D-CDK4/6 for G1 progression, cyclin E-CDK2 for the G1-S transition, cyclin A-CDK2 for S phase progression, and cyclin A/B-CDC2 for entry into M phase (1Poon R.Y.C. Bertino J.R. Encyclopedia of Cancer. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego2002Google Scholar). Apart from these well known roles in the cell cycle, several cyclins and CDKs are involved in processes not directly related to the cell cycle. Cyclin D can bind and activate the estrogen receptor, and CDK5 is activated in postmitotic neurons by p35. The cyclin H-CDK7 complex is a component of both the CDK-activating kinase and the basal transcription factor TFIIH and can phosphorylate CDKs and the carboxyl-terminal repeat domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II, respectively. Other cyclins and CDKs (cyclin C-CDK8, cyclin T-CDK9, and cyclin K) are also known to associate with RNA polymerase II and phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal repeat domain. Cyclin G, a target of p53, recruits PP2A to dephosphorylate MDM2 (2Okamoto K., Li, H. Jensen M.R. Zhang T. Taya Y. Thorgeirsson S.S. Prives C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Finally, cyclin T-CDK9 interacts directly with the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 Tat protein and enhances Tat binding to the viral TAR RNA stem-loop structure. Despite the large amount of information known about cyclins, the functions and regulation of several “orphan” cyclins, notably cyclin F and cyclin I, remain to be determined. Cyclin F is the largest and in many respects one of the most interesting members of the cyclin family. Apart from the cyclin box region common to all cyclins, cyclin F also contains an F-box motif at the N terminus and PEST sequences at the COOH-terminal quarter of the protein. The F-box motif (which originally derived its name from cyclin F) is responsible for binding to SKP1 in the formation of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex (3Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K., Ma, L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). The PEST sequence (proline-, glutamic acid-, serine-, and threonine-rich) is typically present in rapidly turnover proteins (4Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). Finally, the cyclin box of cyclin F is highly unusual, because no CDK partners have been identified, and it can bind to another molecule of cyclin (5Kong M. Barnes E.A. Ollendorff V. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1378-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The expression profile of cyclin F is most similar to that of cyclin A. Cyclin F mRNA begins to accumulate in S phase, peaks in G2, and declines before mitosis. The accumulation and decline of cyclin F mRNA occur slightly ahead of cyclin B1 and nearly coincide with the profile of cyclin A mRNA (6Bai C. Richman R. Elledge S.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6087-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Accumulation of cyclin A and cyclin F mRNA during G2 phase has been confirmed by microarray analysis (7Chaudhry M.A. Chodosh L.A. McKenna W.G. Muschel R.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1934-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At the protein level, cyclin F accumulates during S phase and decreases around mitosis, again similar to cyclin A (6Bai C. Richman R. Elledge S.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6087-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 8Arooz T. Yam C.H. Siu W.Y. Lau A., Li, K.K. Poon R.Y.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9494-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Overexpression of cyclin F causes an accumulation of the G2/M population (6Bai C. Richman R. Elledge S.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6087-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This effect is stronger with a mutant cyclin F lacking the PEST region. However, it is not clear whether this is due to a delay of G2/M, a shortening of G1or S, or the competition with a common CDK partner. Overexpressed cyclin F accumulates in the nucleus due to the presence of two nuclear localization sequences, but a portion of cells also displays perinuclear staining (5Kong M. Barnes E.A. Ollendorff V. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1378-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6Bai C. Richman R. Elledge S.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6087-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this connection, it has been shown that the cyclin box region of cyclin F can bind to the cytoplasmic retention sequence region of cyclin B1 by yeast two-hybrid, in vitrobinding, and co-immunoprecipitation assays (5Kong M. Barnes E.A. Ollendorff V. Donoghue D.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1378-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It is believed that during the G2/M transition, cyclin F may carry cyclin B1 (which lacks its own nuclear localization sequence) into the nucleus by virtue of the nuclear localization sequence in cyclin F. Ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolysis of cyclin A and cyclin B requires a short sequence near their N terminus called the destruction box (D-box) (9Hershko A. Ganoth D. Pehrson J. Palazzo R.E. Cohen L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16376-16379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin ligase E3 for cyclin B1 in mitosis is the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome complexed with CDC20 (11Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 931-943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Cyclin A is probably also degraded by anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome-CDC20 (12Sigrist S. Jacobs H. Stratmann R. Lehner C.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4827-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 13Dawson I.A. Roth S. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. J.

Cell. 1995; 6: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), although the difference in the timing of degradation between cyclin A and cyclin B1 argues for the involvement of distinct mechanisms. Despite the fact that cyclin A and cyclin F are degraded at the same time, no D-box sequence is recognized in cyclin F. Instead, PEST sequences at the COOH-terminal quarter of cyclin F may represent a possible destruction signal (4Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1960) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that other mammalian cyclins including cyclin D1, cyclin T1, and cyclin G2 also contain PEST sequences. The molecular basis of proteolysis of PEST-containing protein is far from clear. Proteolysis of several PEST-containing proteins involves the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain (16Shumway S.D. Maki M. Miyamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30874-30881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 17Noguchi M. Sarin A. Aman M.J. Nakajima H. Shores E.W. Henkart P.A. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11534-11539Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas proteolysis of other PEST-containing proteins by calpain is shown to be independent of the PEST sequences (18Molinari M. Anagli J. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2032-2035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Carillo S. Pariat M. Steff A. Jariel-Encontre I. Poulat F. Berta P. Piechaczyk M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Another major class of ubiquitin ligase is the SCF complex comprising SKP1, CUL1, and F-box proteins (20Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 923-925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The F-box motif (first found in cyclin F, Cdc4p, and Skp2p) is involved in direct interaction with SKP1 (3Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K., Ma, L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). It is believed that SCF complexes composed of different F-box subunits target different substrates for ubiquitination. Examples of SCF functions include the ubiquitination of cyclin E by SCFCDC4 and SCFFBW7 (21Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K., Ye, X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J.

Although cyclin F is one of the founding members of the F-box protein family, it is still unclear whether cyclin F can function as an ubiquitin ligase. Furthermore, little is known about how the variation of cyclin F is controlled in the cell cycle and how it is related to cyclin A and cyclin B. Several F-box proteins including Cdc4p (25Mathias N.

All reagents were from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Cyclins in this study were of human origin, and the subtypes were cyclin A2, cyclin B1, and cyclin E1. Cyclin F in pET11d, FLAG-cyclin F in pUHD-P1, FLAG-cyclin A in pUHD-P1, and cyclin E in pLINX were as described previously (30Yam C.H. Siu W.Y. Lau A. Poon R.Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3158-3167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cyclin F lacking the N-terminal F-box region (NΔ79) or cyclin F with only the PEST region (NΔ565) were constructed by PCR using the primers T7 terminator and 5′-TGCCATGGTCCAGGAGCTGTGGCCGTC-3′ (for NΔ79) or 5′-TCCCATGGGGCGGAGAACCAAAC-3′ (for NΔ565) from cyclin F in pET11d; the NcoI-EcoRI fragments were then put into pUHD-P1 or pET21d. Cyclin F in pET11d cut with AvaI was used directly in in vitro translation to produce cyclin F lacking the COOH-terminal PEST region (CΔ565). FLAG-cyclin A-cyclin F(NΔ565) (cyclin A fused to the PEST region of cyclin F) was created by putting the NcoI-cut fragment of cyclin A generated from PCR into FLAG-cyclin F(NΔ565) in pUHD-P1. FLAG-SKP2 for mammalian expression and cyclin A and cyclin A(NΔ71) (ΔD-box) for reticulocyte lysate expression were as described previously (31Yam C.H., Ng, R.W. Siu W.Y. Lau A.W. Poon R.Y.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Human ubiquitin cDNA was a gift from Dr. Tim Hunt (Cancer Research UK). Ubiquitin (Ub) was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-TCCCATGGAAATCTTTGTAAAA-3′ (ubiquitin forward primer introducing anNcoI site) and 5′-GGGCCATGGCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGGTGG-3′ (T7 terminator primer introducing an NcoI site), cut withNcoI, and ligated into pUHD-P2 (30Yam C.H.

HtTA1 cells are HeLa cells (human cervical carcinoma) expressing the tTA tetracycline repressor chimera (30Yam C.H. Siu W.Y. Lau A. Poon R.Y.C. J. Biol.

Cells in G1 phase were obtained 3 h after released from nocodazole block. Cells were blocked in S phase by incubation in medium containing 1.5 mm hydroxyurea for 24 h. In promoter turn-off experiments, doxycycline (1 μg/ml) was added to the medium at 24 h after transfection, and the cells were harvested at the indicated time. In some experiments, cells were treated with actinomycin D (100 ng/ml), cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), LLnL (also called MG101) (50 μm), and LLM (50 μm) for the indicated time. Cells were synchronized with a double thymidine method as described previously (8Arooz T. Yam C.H. Siu W.Y. Lau A., Li, K.K. Poon R.Y.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9494-9501Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Nocodazole (0.1 mg/ml) was added when the cells were released from the second block to prevent them from progressing through the subsequent mitosis. Flow cytometry after propidium iodide staining was performed as described previously (32Siu W.Y. Arooz T. Poon R.Y.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transient transfection and preparation of cell-free extracts were performed as described previously (30Yam C.H. Siu W.Y. Lau A. Poon R.Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3158-3167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Coupled transcription-translation reactions in the presence of [35S]methionine in rabbit reticulocyte lysate were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). For in vitro protein degradation assays, reticulocyte lysate programmed to express recombinant proteins in the presence of [35S]methionine (1 μl) was mixed with 9 μl of buffer or synchronized cell extracts. The reactions were supplemented with an energy regeneration system (25 mm phosphocreatine, 10 mg/ml creatine kinase, and 1 mm ATP). Unless stated otherwise, the reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min and stopped with SDS-sample buffer and boiling. For in vivo ubiquitination assays, constructs expressing FLAG-tagged proteins were co-transfected with HA-Ub in pUHD-P2. The cells were treated with 50 μmof LLnL for 6 h before they were harvested. Cell extracts prepared from the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with either normal rabbit serum or rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibodies. The presence of HA-Ub-conjugated proteins in the immunoprecipitates was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 12CA5. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (33Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Rat monoclonal antibodies YL1/2 against mammalian tubulin, monoclonal antibody HE12 against cyclin E1, monoclonal antibody E23 against cyclin A2 (31Yam C.H., Ng, R.W. Siu W.Y. Lau A.W. Poon R.Y.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), monoclonal antibody A17 against CDC2 (34Kobayashi H. Golsteyn R. Poon R. Stewart E. Gannon J. Minshull J. Smith R. Hunt T. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), anti-PSTAIRE monoclonal antibody (35Poon R.Y.C. Chau M.S. Yamashita K. Hunter T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5168-5178PubMed Google Scholar), and rabbit anti-FLAG polyclonal antibodies (30Yam C.H. Siu W.Y. Lau A. Poon R.Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3158-3167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were obtained from sources as described previously. Monoclonal antibody GNS1 against cyclin B1 (sc-245), rabbit anti-cyclin F polyclonal antibodies (sc-952), goat anti-SKP1 antibodies (sc-1568), and goat anti-SKP2 antibodies (sc-1567) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibody M2 against FLAG tag was obtained from Sigma, and monoclonal antibody 12CA5 against HA tag was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. We first confirmed that the antibodies that we used recognize endogenous cyclin F. Total HeLa cell extracts and cyclin F immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting. Fig.1 A shows that ∼100-kDa proteins were detected in total extracts and in cyclin F immunoprecipitates but not in immunoprecipitates using normal rabbit serum or serum against SKP2 (another F-box protein). The bands recognized by the antibodies co-migrated with recombinant cyclin F (data not shown). We next looked at the oscillation of cyclin F during G2phase in relation to other mitotic cyclins and to see whether cyclin F is affected by checkpoints. HeLa cells were first blocked in early S phase with a double thymidine block method and then synchronously released. We trapped the cells in the subsequent mitosis with nocodazole. As expected, cyclin A was destroyed during G2phase, and cyclin B was stabilized during the nocodazole-induced spindle assembly checkpoint (Fig. 1 B). Flow cytometry indicated that these cells were synchronously released from the early S phase trap and reached G2 phase by 6 h (Fig.1 C). In comparison with cyclin A, cyclin F was synthesized and destroyed more abruptly. Similar to cyclin A but unlike cyclin B, cyclin F was not stabilized by the spindle checkpoint. The relatively constant level of CDC2 served as gel loading control. Given that both cyclin A and cyclin B accumulated when cells were blocked in S phase, we next examined whether cyclin F was affected by the DNA replication checkpoint. Fig.2 A shows that the levels of cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin E were higher in hydroxyurea-treated cells than in control cells. In contrast, similar level of cyclin F was present in these samples, indicating that cyclin F was not stabilized by the DNA replication checkpoint. To see whether the degradation of cyclin F involves proteasomes, cells were treated with nocodazole in the presence or absence of the proteasome/calpain inhibitor LLnL. As expected, cyclin A, cyclin E, and cyclin F were destroyed after nocodazole treatment, but cyclin B was stabilized (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). The destruction of cyclin A and cyclin E requires the proteasome and was abolished by the presence of LLnL (lane 4). In marked contrast, cyclin F was still destroyed in the presence of nocodazole and LLnL. The relatively constant level of tubulin acted as controls for sample loadings. For comparison, the levels of SKP1 (a protein that binds to the F-box region of cyclin F) and SKP2 were not affected by nocodazole and/or LLnL. Adriamycin (ADR) and camptothecin (CMP) are inhibitors of topoisomerase II and topoisomerase I, respectively. Both reagents eventually induce double-stranded breaks in the DNA, but the action of CMP appears to be limited to S phase (reviewed in Ref. 36Bast R.C. Kufe D.W. Pollock R.E. Weichselbaum R.R. Holland J.F. Frei E. Gansler T.S. Cancer Medicine. 5th Ed. B.C. Decker Inc., Toronto, Canada2000Google Scholar). ADR-arrested HeLa cells in G2 phase and CMP-arrested cells predominantly in S phase (Fig.3 A). CDC2 shifted to a slower migrating form that represented Thr14/Tyr15phosphorylation and inactivation of its kinase activity (Fig.3 B). Furthermore, both cyclin A and cyclin B accumulated after ADR and CMP treatments. The levels of cyclin A and cyclin B declined at higher dosage of ADR and CMP, probably due to cell death at these levels of DNA damage. Interestingly, cyclin F also accumulated after ADR or CMP treatments, mirroring closely the inactivation of CDC2. Taken together, these data showed that the important checkpoints that affect cells from S phase to mitosis have different effects on different cyclins. The A-, B-, and E-type cyclins are stabilized by the DNA replication checkpoint. In contrast, only cyclin B is stabilized by the spindle assembly checkpoint. Finally, the A-, B-, and F-type cyclins accumulated during the DNA damage checkpoints that delay S phase and G2 phase. We next analyzed the stability of the endogenous cyclin F in relation to other cyclins. Whende novo protein synthesis was inhibited with cycloheximide, cyclin F disappeared in less than 1 h (Fig.4 A, lanes 6–10), suggesting that cyclin F was a very unstable protein in growing cells. Cyclin F also decreased when transcription was blocked with actinomycin D, but this occurred more slowly than with cycloheximide (lanes 1–5). This indicates that cyclin F protein has a shorter half-life than its mRNA. Not surprisingly, adding actinomycin D and cycloheximide together induced the disappearance of cyclin F at similar rate as with cycloheximide alone. In contrast, cyclin A and cyclin B were more stable than cyclin F, and reduction of the proteins were only appreciable at later time points. The relatively stable protein CDC2 acted as a control for sample loading. Since cyclin F starts to accumulate during S phase, we next investigated the stability of cyclin F in the presence of hydroxyurea (Fig. 4 B). A similar short half-life of cyclin F protein was observed in S phase as in growing cells. However, the mRNA of cyclin F appeared to be more stable during S phase, since cyclin F remained elevated following actinomycin D treatment. We have not been able to examine the stability of cyclin F in G2 phase due to the lack of a good nontoxic G2 cell cycle blocker. Hence, given the short half-life of the protein, the major determinants of cyclin F level are probably due to transcription control and mRNA stability. It is hypothesized that the stability of one cyclin may be affected by the expression of another type of cyclin. This could be attributed to either a direct effect of the cyclin on the degradation machinery, or indirectly due to the cell cycle block imposed by the cyclin. We investigated the stability of cyclin F by putting its cDNA under the control of a doxycycline-responding promoter. The addition of doxycycline reduced the level of FLAG-tagged cyclin F to an undetectable level (Fig. 5 A). We found that co-transfection of FLAG-cyclin F with constitutive expression plasmids for cyclin A, cyclin B, or cyclin E (also shown by immunoblotting) did not affect the stability of cyclin F. For comparison, similar experiments performed with cyclin E showed that its stability was reduced when co-expressed with cyclin A or cyclin B but not with cyclin F (Fig. 5 B). One implication from these results is that the stability of cyclin F is not sensitive to cell cycle arrest caused by overexpression of other cyclins. Cyclin F contains two structural elements that are generally connected to proteolysis: an F-box motif at the N terminus and the PEST sequences at the COOH-terminal quarter of the protein. We used an in vitrodegradation system to elucidate the relationship between these structural elements and cyclin F stability. Radiolabeled cyclin A or cyclin F was produced in a coupled transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate system. Recombinant cyclin A was destroyed when it was mixed with extracts from nocodazole-blocked cells (Fig.6 A). Deletion of the N-terminal region of cyclin A that contains the destruction box sequence (ΔD-box) (see Fig. 6 B) abolished its degradation, suggesting that the degradation was not due to nonspecific proteolysis. Fig. 6 C shows that cyclin F was also degraded using the samein vitro system. Moreover, degradation of cyclin F was not affected by removing the F-box region (ΔF-box). Importantly, the stability of cyclin F was substantially increased when the PEST-containing COOH-terminal region was removed (ΔPEST). We found that whereas cyclin A was degraded by mitotic extracts, it was relatively stable in G1 cell extracts (Fig. 6 D). In contrast, cyclin F was similarly degraded in both mitotic and G1 cell extracts. Immunoblotting of the extracts for cyclin B and PSTAIRE confirmed that the G1 cells had exited mitosis and that similar amounts of extracts were used, respectively. These data indicate that whereas the destruction machinery for cyclin A was active during mitosis but not in G1, the mechanism that degraded cyclin F was equally active during mitosis and G1, further testifying to the difference between the degradation of cyclin A and cyclin F. To confirm that deletion of the F-box region did indeed disrupt the interaction between cyclin F and SKP1, we looked at whether recombinant cyclin F could bind to SKP1. Fig.7 A shows that endogenous SKP1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-cyclin F but not with immunoprecipitates of control normal rabbit serum. For comparison, SKP1 was also co-immunoprecipitated with SKP2. It is known that SKP2 can form a complex with cyclin A-CDK complexes (37Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), as was confirmed in Fig. 7 A. Interestingly, no interaction between cyclin F and cyclin A-CDK complexes was detected under similar conditions. Significantly, cyclin F lacking the N terminus (ΔF-box) did not form a complex with SKP1 (Fig. 7 B). We used an in vivo ubiquitination assay to see whether cyclin F was ubiquitinated. FLAG-tagged cyclins were co-expressed with a HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub), and proteasome inhibitors were added to stabilize the ubiquitinated proteins. A smear of high molecular weight, HA-containing proteins in the FLAG immunoprecipitates indicated conjugation of HA-Ub to the cyclins (Fig.8). As expected, both cyclin A and cyclin B were ubiquitinated in vivo. In contrast, no HA-Ub-conjugated protein was seen with FLAG-cyclin F. As controls, neither FLAG-tagged cyclins nor HA-Ub-conjugated proteins was immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum. Based on this and other evidence shown above, we interpret that in contrast to other cyclins, cyclin F was not targeted by the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Given that cyclin F was not degraded through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, what are the proteases that are responsible for the rapid turnover of cyclin F? To begin to address this question, inhibitors of various classes of proteases were added to the in vitro degradation assay for cyclin F. Fig.9 A shows that the only reagents that significantly inhibited the degradation of cyclin F were EDTA and EGTA. The above datum suggests that degradation of cyclin F may involve proteases that use metal ions as active centers (metalloproteases) or other metal-dependent proteases like calpain. It is known that proteolysis of several PEST-containing proteins like IκB and γc involves calpain (16Shumway S.D. Maki M. Miyamoto S. J. Biol.

Although degradation of cyclin F was inhibited by EGTA, we do not favor the idea that calpain is responsible for the rapid turnover of cyclin F. This is because the cysteine protease inhibitor E64 did not inhibit th"

We used proteomic analysis to examine differences in rat kidney protein expression during EH, and their potential relationship to EH-induced hypertension. Young male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either EH or sustained hypoxia (SH) for 14 (EH14/SH14) and 30 (EH30/SH30) days. Mean arterial blood pressure was significantly increased only in EH30 (p< 0.0002). Kidney proteins were resolved by two-dimensional-PAGE and were identified by MALDI-MS. Renal expression of kallistatin, a potent vasodilator, was down-regulated in all animals. Expression of α-1-antitrypsin, an inhibitor of kallikrein activation, was up-regulated in EH but down-regulated in SH. Western blotting showed significant elevation of B2-bradykinin receptor expression in all normotensive animals but remained unchanged in hypertensive animals. Proteins relevant to vascular hypertrophy, such as smooth muscle myosin and protein-disulfide isomerase were up-regulated in EH30 but were down-regulated in SH30. These data indicate that EH induces changes in renal protein expression consistent with impairment of vasodilation mediated by the kallikrein-kallistatin pathway and vascular hypertrophy. In contrast, SH-induced changes suggest the kallikrein- and bradykinin-mediated compensatory mechanisms for prevention of hypertension and vascular remodeling. To test the hypothesis suggested by the proteomic data, we measured the effect of EH on blood pressure in transgenic hKLK1 rats that overexpress human kallikrein. Transgenic hKLK1 animals were protected from EH-induced hypertension. We conclude that EH-induced hypertension may result, at least in part, from altered regulation of the renal kallikrein system.

Indeed, OSAS has been demonstrated to be an independent risk factor for systemic hypertension, and the relative risk is elevated even in young children (8Grote L. Hedner J. Peter J.H. J. Hypertens. 2000; 18: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 11Marcus C.L. Greene M.G. Carroll J.L. Am. J. Respir.

Stewart D. Mahony J. Farrell P. ASAIO J. 1995; 41: M435-M441Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The pathophysiology of systemic hypertension in OSAS is complex. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity induced by the intermittent hypoxia that characteristically accompanies OSAS appears to mediate hypertension during OSAS via a mechanism that requires changes in the vasoreactivity of resistance vascular beds such as the kidney (13Fletcher E.C.

Physiol. 1999; 87: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Indeed, sustained hypoxia (SH) does not lead to hypertension as do pharmacologically-mediated decreases of angiotensin II levels and blockade of angiotensin receptors (20Fletcher E.C. Bao G. Li R. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 21Schweda F. Blumberg F.C. Schweda A. Kammerl M. Holmer S.R. Riegger G.A. Pfeifer M. Kramer B.K. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2000; 15: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These data suggest that changes in renal vasoconstrictors play a major role in the development of hypertension during OSAS. Blood pressure is also modulated by vasodilatory components of the kinin cascade that are produced in the kidney, but little is known about their role in OSAS-induced hypertension. Therefore, we hypothesized that alterations in the kinin cascade would contribute to OSAS-induced hypertension. We wished to study coordinated changes in renal protein expression to examine concomitant alterations in vasodilators and vasoconstrictor proteins that modulate blood pressure control in this organ. Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and other techniques have been previously used to study renal protein expression (22Mizutani T. Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1998; 105: 151-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 23Matsuda R. Kaneko N. Horikawa Y. Chiwaki F. Shinozaki M. Abe S. Yumura W. Nihei H. Ieiri T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2000; 298: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, these techniques are limited by the efficiency of analysis of multiple proteins and by the availability of specific antibodies that identify a protein of interest. Proteomic analysis is an innovative approach to determine coordinated changes in protein expression in tissues and cells (24Banks R.E. Dunn M.J. Hochstrasser D.F. Sanchez J.C. Blackstock W. Pappin D.J. Selby P.J. Lancet. 2000; 356: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 25Patterson S.D. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 2: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One common approach to proteomic analysis is two-dimensional PAGE. The proteins are separated by differential isoelectric point (pI) in the first dimension and by differential molecular weight (Mw) in the second dimension. Using fluorescent stains, protein spots on the gel can be visualized, and differences in expression can be quantified. Proteins are then identified by in-gel tryptic digestion, mass spectrometry, and peptide mass fingerprinting. This series of techniques create a profile of contemporaneous changes in protein expression or post-translational modifications. We therefore used proteomic analysis to examine changes in renal protein expression during EH and SH. We observed consistent changes in renal protein expression in response to EH-induced hypertension that differed from SH-induced changes. Two groups of proteins were altered; members of the kallikrein pathway and components of smooth muscle. A decrease in expression of kallistatin, a potent vasodilator, was observed in all groups but only animals exposed to long-term EH developed hypertension. B2R expression and kallikrein levels were significantly increased in normotensive SH-exposed animals, but remained unchanged in hypertensive animals. Overexpression of renal kallikrein in transgenic hKLK1 animals prevented EH-induced hypertension. We conclude that changes in the renal kallistatin and kallikrein-kinin pathway are associated with the hypertensive response to EH and maintenance of normal blood pressure in SH. These complex mechanisms may play a significant role in the development of hypertension during OSAS. Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley male rats weighing 175–200 g were used in this study (12 for 14-day experiments and 12 for 30 days). Also, transgenic hKLK1 that express human kallikrein were used. The transgenic hKLK1 transgenic line was constructed and maintained as described previously (26Silva Jr., J.A. Araujo R.C. Baltatu O. Oliveira S.M. Tschope C. Fink E. Hoffmann S. Plehm R. Chai K.X. Chao L. Chao J. Ganten D. Pesquero J.B. Bader M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1858-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Louisville. Animals were placed in 4 identical commercially designed chambers (30 × 20 × 20; Oxycycler model A44XO, Reming Bioinstruments, Redfield, NY), that were operated under a 12-h light-dark cycle (6:00 AM-6:00 PM). Gas was circulated around each of the chambers, attached tubing and other units at 60 liters/min (i.e. one complete change per 10 s). The O2 concentration was continuously measured by an O2 analyzer and was changed by a computerized system controlling the gas valve outlets, such that the moment-to-moment desired oxygen concentration of the chamber was programmed and adjusted automatically. Deviations from the desired concentration were met by addition of N2 or O2 through solenoid valves. Ambient CO2 in the chamber was periodically monitored and maintained at <0.01% by adjusting overall chamber basal ventilation. The gas was also circulated through a molecular sieve (Type 3A, Fisons, UK) so as to remove ammonia. Humidity was measured and maintained at 40–50% by changing basal ventilatory inputs. Ambient temperature was kept at 22–24 °C. The EH profile consisted of alternating room air and 10% oxygen every 90 s during daylight hours, while oxygen concentration was maintained at 10% throughout the duration of the exposure in SH. Control animals were exposed to circulating normoxic gas in one of the chambers. For blood pressure measurements, rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and in-dwelling catheters (PE50, 0.56 mm ID, 0.88 mm OD) were introduced into the femoral artery and advanced into the abdominal aorta. Catheters were secured in the groin area with sutures, tunneled under the skin into the dorsal neck region, flushed with a heparin-containing solution (1000 units/ml in saline), sealed with heat, and stored in a plastic cap sutured to the skin. Recordings were in the freely behaving conscious animals 48 h after surgery. We have previously shown that full resumption of grooming, ingestive, and other behaviors occur after this recovery period (27Gozal D. Torres J.E. Gozal Y.M. Littwin S.M. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 81: 2068-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After assessment of baseline blood pressure, baroreceptor function was examined. This consisted in the administration of the vasoactive drugs phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside, for activation or deactivation of baroreceptors, which was performed every 60–120 s (solution concentration, 100 g/ml; infusion rate, 20, 30, 40, 60 liters/min). The mean steady-state values during the 20 beats preceding each dose administration were considered as baseline. At least 15 min after phenylephrine infusion and 30 min after sodium nitroprusside infusion were allowed for the hemodynamic parameters to return to baseline. In all animals, both arterial blood pressure and heart rate were measured from the arterial line connected to a calibrated pressure transducer. The analog signal was digitized and signal processed using peak-trough software routines to derive mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) on a beat-to-beat mode (BuxcoElectronics, Troy, NY). Absolute values for HR (beats/min) were used to evaluate the arterial baroreflex during changes in blood pressure. For each instantaneous HR value, the corresponding MAP was calculated. The MAP was plotted against HR for each of the drug doses. Data points representing the spontaneous changes in MAP and corresponding reflex changes in HR were plotted, and the baroreflex regulation of HR was calculated by constructing a logistic function curve compiled from data obtained by intravenous infusion in increasing doses of phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside (28Kent B.B. Drane J.W. Blumenstein B. Manning J.W. Cardiology. 1972; 57: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Therefore, the data from each rat were also fitted to a sigmoid logistic function described by the following Equation1, HR=P4+{(P1)/1+exp[P2(MAP−P3)]}Equation 1 where P1 is the range of HR; P2 is the coefficient to calculate the gain as a function of pressure; P3 is the pressure at the midrange of curve; and P4 is the minimum response of HR. The gain (expressed as bpm/mmHg) at any given MAP was then calculated using Equation 2. Gain=P1P2{exp[P2(MAP−P3)]}/{1+exp[P2(MAP−P3)]}2Equation 2 After 14 and 30 days of the different exposures, rats were sacrificed by a pentobarbital overdose. The kidneys were dissected, and the capsules were removed. The kidneys were frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to powder using prechilled mortar and pestle. Tissues were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mmol/liter Tris, 0.3% SDS, and 200 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, incubated at 100 °C for 5 min, and transferred to ice. One-tenth volume of a buffer containing with 500 mmol/liter Tris, 50 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml DNase I, and 0.25 mg/ml RNase A was added and incubated for an additional 10 min. The 12,000 rpm supernatants were obtained, 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to precipitate proteins, and the 12,000 rpm pellets were obtained. After several washes with acetone, the pellets were resuspended in a sample buffer containing 40 mmol/liter Tris, 7.92 mol/liter urea, 0.06% SDS, 1.76% ampholytes, 120 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, and 3.2% Triton X-100. The concentration levels of proteins were measured by spectrophotometry using Bio-Rad protein microassay based on Bradford's method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Tube gel running system (Genomic Solutions Inc., Ann Arbor, MI) was used for first-dimensional running with 100 mmol/liter sodium hydroxide, the cathode buffer, and 10 mmol/liter phosphoric acid, the anode buffer. Pre-cast carrier ampholyte tube gels, pH 3–10, 1 × 180 mm, were prefocused with maximal 1500 V and 110 μA per tube. The protein samples of 100 μg were loaded into the tube gels and were focused for 17 h and 30 min to reach 18,000 Vh. The gels were extruded from the tubes after completion of focusing and were incubated in premixed Tris acetate equilibration buffer with 0.01% bromphenol blue and 50 mmol/liter dithiothreitol for 2 min before loading onto pre-cast 10% homogeneous, 200 × 200 mm, slab gels (Genomic Solutions Inc.). Upper running buffer contained with 0.2 mol/liter Tris base, 0.2 mol/liter Tricine, and 0.4% SDS. Lower running buffer was 0.625 mol/liter Tris acetate. The system was run with maximal 500 V and 20,000 mW per gel. The gel slabs were fixed in 10% methanol and 7% acetic acid for 30 min. The fixed solution was removed, and 500 ml of SYPRO ruby gel stain was added to each gel and incubated on a gently continuous rocker at room temperature for 18 h. A high-resolution 12-bit camera with a UV light box system (Genomic Solutions Inc.) was used to visualize the gel images. Gels were exposed to UV light for five different exposure time points (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 s). Investigator HT analyzer (Genomic Solutions Inc.) software was used for matching and quantitative analysis of the protein spots on the gels. The average gel was constructed as a represented gel for each group of experiment. The average mode of background subtraction was used for normalization of intensity volume that represents protein concentration or amount on each spot. The average gel was then used for determination of the existence of and difference of protein expression between each group. In-gel tryptic digestion was performed as previously described by our laboratory (30Thongboonkerd V. Luengpailin J. Cao J. Pierce W.M. Cai J. Klein J.B. Doyle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16599-16605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mass spectral data were obtained using a Micromass Tof-Spec 2E instrument equipped with a 337 nm N2 laser at 20–35% power in the positive ion reflectron mode. Spectral data were obtained by averaging 10 spectra, each of which was the composite of 10 laser firings. The mass axis was calibrated using known peaks from tryptic autolysis. Peptide mass fingerprinting was used for protein identification from tryptic fragment sizes by using the MASCOT search engine (www.matrixscience.com) based on the entire NCBI and SwissProt protein data bases using the assumption that peptides are monoisotopic, oxidized at methionine residues, and carbamidomethylated at cysteine residues. Up to 1 missed trypsin cleavage was allowed although most matches did not contain any missed cleavages. Mass tolerance of 150 ppm was the window of error to be allowed for matching the peptide mass values. Probability-based MOWSE scores were estimated by comparison of search results against estimated random match population and were reported as −10 × log10(P), where P is the absolute probability. Scores greater than 71 were considered significant (p < 0.05). All protein identifications were in the expected size range based on its position in the gel. The kidneys were homogenized in phosphate saline buffer (pH 7.0) and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants were saved. Deoxycholate was added to 0.5% into the samples, and the mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The mixtures were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatants were saved, and the protein concentrations were measured by Bradford's method. SDS sample buffer (Tris-HCl, glycerol, SDS, dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue) was added 1:1 to the protein solution, the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 5 min, and 50 μg of protein was loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins on the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting. The membrane was treated with primary antibody against mouse B2-bradykinin receptor (BD Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ) 1:1000 in 5% milk/TTBS at 4 °C overnight and immunoreactive protein was detected by radiography using goat anti-mouse IgG-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The kidneys were homogenized in phosphate saline buffer (pH 7.0) and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants were saved. Deoxycholate was added to 0.5% to the samples, and the mixtures were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The mixtures were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatants were saved, and the protein concentrations were measured by Bradford's method. Kallikrein level was measured by ELISA as previously described and presented as ng/mg of total protein (31Wang C. Chao L. Chao J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1710-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For physiological variables, differences between the various treatment groups were compared by two-way analysis of variance and the Newman-Keuls multiple range test for multiple comparisons. Mann-Whitney Test by SPSS software was used for comparison of protein expression differences between the groups. Statistical significance was set at the 95% confidence limit. Table I shows mean arterial blood pressure and baroreceptor gain for normoxic rats and those exposed to EH and SH. EH14 animals had mild reductions in baroreceptor gain, but blood pressure was within normal limits. However, all of the EH30 animals were hypertensive and had marked attenuation of baroreceptor gain. In contrast, none of the animals in the SH group developed hypertension or attenuation of baroreceptor gain at either SH14 or SH30.Table IMean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and baroreceptor gain in young male rats exposed to EH or SH for 14 or 30 days and controls.MAPBaroreceptor Gainmm Hgbpm/mmHgControl89.7 ± 3.7*aP < 0.0002.4.15 ± 0.17*aP < 0.0002.EH1492.3 ± 3.92.68 ± 0.13*aP < 0.0002.EH30104.7 ± 4.2*aP < 0.0002.2.22 ± 0.10*aP < 0.0002.SH1488.7 ± 3.44.13 ± 0.18SH3090.4 ± 3.94.18 ± 0.21a P < 0.0002. Open table in a new tab The expression of 248 protein spots was analyzed on each gel. An average image was established from multiple gels as a reference gel for each group. The intensity of each matched spot was compared. All of the differentially expressed protein spots were excised, underwent in-gel tryptic digestion and analyzed by MALDI-TOF. Fig. 1 Ademonstrates typical mass spectra, in this instance obtained from the gel spot corresponding to the kallikrein-binding protein (kallistatin). Fig. 1 B illustrates the results of the peptide mass fingerprinting method performed using the Mascot protein search engine to query the NCBI data base. Shown in Fig. 2, A–C are the renal proteome maps of RA30 (A), EH30 (B), and SH30 (C) animals. Summarized in TableII are the expression levels of the differentially expressed proteins as labeled in Fig. 2. As shown in Table II, all five forms of kallistatin were significantly down-regulated, whereas all five forms of α-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) precursor were significantly up-regulated in EH30 hypertensive animals. β-actin, vimentin, protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), smooth muscle myosin, and ferritin were also significantly up-regulated in EH30. As shown in Table II, SH30 animals expressed 13 proteins from 25 protein spots that had altered expression. Four of five forms of kallistatin were down-regulated in SH30. Other down-regulated proteins were PDI, smooth muscle myosin, vimentin, tropomyosin, calbindin, ATPase δ chain, and apolipoprotein A-I. Three of five forms of A1AT precursor could not be detected in SH30 gels. Up-regulated proteins in SH30 included ferritin, β-actin, and deoxyribonuclease I (Dnase I).

Because the kallikrein/kallistatin pathway has been shown to modulate the response to bradykinin and B2-bradykinin receptor (B2R) can be directly activated by kallikrein (32Hecquet C. Tan F. Marcic B.M. Erdos E.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of EH and SH on B2R expression. Extracted kidney tissue was analyzed by immunoblotting, and a single 42-kDa band was observed consistent with the B2R. Densitometry was performed to compare signal intensity of each sample. As shown in Fig. 3, A andB, B2R expression was significantly increased in kidneys exposed to either EH or SH for 14 days. However, B2R expression remained elevated only in kidneys from SH30 animals. B2R expression fell to basal levels in animals exposed to EH30 that developed hypertension (Fig. 3 C). Because kallikrein can directly activate the B2R and thereby directly promote vasodilation, we wished to determine if hypertensive EH30 animals had changes in kallikrein expression. Renal kallikre"

It is known that Stat6 is rapidly activated in response to IL-4; however, the fate of activated Stat6 is less clear. We examined the fate of activated Stat6 and found that during continuous exposure to IL-4, Stat6 activity was sustained for 72 h and that the maintenance of a constant level of activated Stat6 did not require new protein synthesis. In contrast, when cells were pulsed with IL-4 and then incubated in the absence of IL-4, the half-life of Stat6 phosphorylation and DNA binding activity was less than 1 h. Stat6 did not accumulate in the nucleus, and protein degradation did not play a major role in the disappearance of activated Stat6. Inhibition of kinase activity by staurosporine or the JAK inhibitor, AG490, revealed that maintenance of Stat6 activation in the continuous presence of IL-4 required ongoing phosphorylation of latent cytoplasmic Stat6 molecules. Cells treated with an inhibitor of nuclear export, leptomycin B, were unable to maintain Stat6 activation. Thus, the maintenance of Stat6 activation requires a constant cycle of activation, deactivation, nuclear export, and reactivation.

These proteins exist as latent cytoplasmic monomers until cytokine stimulation, whereupon they are phosphorylated by the Janus family of kinases (JAKs), dimerize, and translocate to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, activated Stats bind specific canonical DNA elements and initiate cytokine-specific gene transcription in what is commonly referred to as the JAK/Stat pathway of signal transduction (1Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). To date, six Stat proteins have been described (2Hoey T. Schindler U. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and of these only Stat6 has been shown to be specifically activated by IL-4 (3Quelle F.W. Shimoda K. Thierfelder W. Fischer C. Kim A.

It is clear from the characterization of Stat6-deficient mice that Stat6 is required for IL-4-dependent gene induction. Stat6−/− mice are deficient in their ability to mount a Th2 response following nematode infection, fail to produce IgE, and do not develop airway hypersensitivity following antigen challenge (3Quelle F.W.

Med. 1997; 186: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Stat6 is also activated by IL-13 via the IL-13 receptor complex, and Stat6-deficient mice display impaired IL-13 responses (10Takeda K. Kamanaka M. Tanaka T. Kishimoto T. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3220-3222PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Stat6 following receptor engagement involves multiple steps. First, association of Stat6 with tyrosine-phosphorylated regions of cytokine receptors occurs via its SH2 domain. Subsequently, Stat6 is phosphorylated on Tyr-641, a residue critical for Stat6 function (11Mikita T. Campbell D., Wu, P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and phosphorylated Stat6 monomers dimerize via their respective amino-terminal domains (12Mikita T. Daniel C., Wu, P. Schindler U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17634-17642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Activated Stat6 dimers then translocate to the nucleus, bind specific consensus sequences, and promote transcription of downstream genes. The crystal structure of Stat1-DNA complexes revealed that dimeric interaction between the two respective SH2 domains was critical for the formation of the DNA binding region (13Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation of Stat6 depends on its phosphorylation and dimerization (11Mikita T. Campbell D., Wu, P. Williamson K. Schindler U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5811-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 14Mowen K. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30073-30076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); however, the elements responsible for nuclear localization of Stat6 have not been identified. Although Stat6 activation in response to IL-4 and -13 has been well documented, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the termination of Stat signaling remain poorly understood. A number of negative regulators of the JAK/Stat signaling pathway have been described, including Silencers Of CytokineSignaling (SOCS) and ProteinInhibitors of Activated Stat (PIAS). SOCS proteins form a negative feedback loop whereby SOCS genes are induced following cytokine stimulation and inhibit cytokine signaling (15Venktaraman C. Leung S. Slavekar A. Mano H. Schindler U. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4053-4061PubMed Google Scholar, 16Losman J.A. Chen X.P. Hilton D. Rothman P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3770-3774PubMed Google Scholar). SOCS-1 has been shown to bind and inhibit JAK kinases, but this may not be true of all SOCS family members. A number of PIAS proteins have recently been described with specificity for some Stat family members (17Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 18Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). These proteins bind specifically to phosphorylated Stat dimers and prevent them from binding DNA (19Liao J., Fu, Y. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5267-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that Stat1 function is modulated by methylation of Arg-31 (20Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Arg-31 is conserved among the Stat molecules, and methylation is likely generally important for Stat function. The mechanism of this methylation-dependent modulation appears to be regulation at the level of Stat1-PIAS1 association. PIAS1 binds to Stat1 dimers and prevents Stat1 DNA binding. Methylation of Stat1 reduces its ability to associate with PIAS and thus increases Stat1 DNA binding activity (20Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). No PIAS has yet been identified for Stat6. The tyrosine kinase, Fes, has also been implicated as a regulator of JAK/Stat signaling. Stat activation was enhanced in macrophages derived from c-Fes−/− mice (21Hackenmiller R. Kim J. Feldman R.A. Simon M.C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The multiple levels of regulation along the JAK/Stat activation cascade underscore the importance of this pathway, and it is likely that the degradation or recycling of these mediators is also tightly regulated. Several possibilities exist as to the fate of an activated Stat6 molecule once it has completed its role in IL-4 or -13-dependent signal transduction. One possibility is that Stat6 is ubiquinated and regulated by proteasomal degradation. Indeed, inhibitors of proteasome degradation have been shown to prolong Stat1 (22Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 23Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and Stat6 activation (24Wang D. Moriggl R. Stravopodis D. Carpino N. Marine J.C. Teglund S. Feng J. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 392-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a constant cycle of activation, degradation, and de novo protein synthesis may be required to maintain a prolonged Stat6 response. A second possibility is that activated Stat6 in the nucleus is deactivated by dephosphorylation through the action of a specific phosphatase. Several studies have implicated tyrosine phosphatases in the regulation of Stat signaling (23Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 25David M. Grimley P.M. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7515-7521Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 26Haque S.J. Flati V. Deb A. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25709-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, studies examining Stat1 have shown that activated Stat1 disappears from the nucleus within 60 min and that removal of the activated Stat1 is dependent on a protein-tyrosine phosphatase (23Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Such a model would implicate specific nuclear protein-tyrosine phosphatases in Stat6 deactivation. The deactivated Stat6 molecule could then be degraded or shuttled back to the cytoplasm where it could be reactivated via tyrosine phosphorylation. Here we have investigated the fate of activated Stat6 and provide the first evidence that Stat6 cycling is required for IL-4 signaling. A201.1 murine B cells, a gift from Dr. Gregg Milligan (Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH), are derived from the parent line A20. The cells are B220+, IgG+, Ia+, IgA−, IgM−, and IgD−. Cells were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 (cRPMI), consisting of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mml-glutamine (Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, MD), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Bio-Whittaker), and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Recombinant mouse IL-4 was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc., (Minneapolis, MN). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled anti-murine CD23 antibody was purchased from BD PharMingen. Polyclonal anti-Stat6 antibody, S-20, was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-phospho STAT6 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [35S]methionine was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Staurosporine and leptomycin B were purchased from Sigma. AG490 was purchased from Calbiochem. A201.1 cells (2.5 × 106) were stimulated with murine IL-4 in cRPMI for various time intervals, ranging from 15 min to 72 h. For pulse conditions, cells were stimulated with murine IL-4 for 15 min, pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g, washed once with cRPMI, reconstituted in cRPMI, and cultured at 37 °C for additional time periods. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and reconstituted in lysis buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatants containing the cytoplasmic extracts were removed. Pelleted nuclei were reconstituted in nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Nuclei were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C, centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were removed as nuclear extracts. After quantitation of protein by Coomassie Plus (Pierce), 5.0 μg of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were reconstituted in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA). Equal volumes of 2× EMSA reaction buffer (24 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 8 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 24% glycerol, 0.08 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) were added, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 min on ice. Reactions were incubated with 0.2 ng of Stat6 probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP for an additional 10 min on ice. A 100-fold excess of unlabeled nucleotide (20 ng) was used in cold competition samples, and 1.0 μl of anti-Stat6 polyclonal antibody was added to supershift samples. Extracts were incubated on ice for an additional hour and then electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (Tris-borate EDTA). Bands were visualized by autoradiography. A201.1 cells (2 × 107) were incubated in the presence of 5 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma), to inhibit protein synthesis, or in media alone. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g at 4 °C and reconstituted in immunoprecipitation-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mmiodoacetamide, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 mmNaF, 1 mm EDTA). Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. Soluble Stat6 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Stat6 polyclonal antibody followed by Protein A/G PLUS agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) as previously described (28Khurana Hershey G.K. Schreiber R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11981-11988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, precipitates were washed in IP-lysis buffer and resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked overnight at 4 °C in block solution (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 20,000). Membranes were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) or anti-Stat6 polyclonal antibody. Bound antibodies were detected by incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Transduction Labs) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL substrate (Amersham Biosciences). A201.1 cells (5 × 105) were continuously stimulated with murine IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for various durations of time, out to 48 h, under standard culture conditions. For pulse conditions, cells were stimulated with murine IL-4, washed with cRPMI, and then cultured under standard conditions for a total of 48 h. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1.0% fetal bovine serum and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse CD23 antibody in the presence of anti-Fc receptor antibody 2.4G2 (both from BD PharMingen) for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1% fetal bovine serum and analyzed on a FACScan instrument (BD PharMingen). A201.1 cells in culture were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline with 1% fetal bovine serum, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA), and stained with anti-Stat6 or rabbit IgG followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-Goat F(ab)2 anti-rabbit (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL) in a solution containing phosphate-buffered saline, 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.2% saponin, and 3% cold fish gelatin (Sigma). After the final wash, the cells were resuspended in a minimal volume of Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA), placed on a slide, covered with a coverslip, and the edges sealed with nail polish. Cells were observed on a Leica DM IRBC confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). We first investigated the kinetics of Stat6 activity when A201.1 cells were continuously exposed to IL-4 (Fig.1). When cells were continuously incubated with IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for 6 h, Stat6 was maximally activated in the nucleus within 15 min of IL-4 exposure, and this activity was maintained in the nucleus for as long as 6 h (Fig.1 A). Negligible levels of activated Stat6 were detected in the cytoplasm at all time points. These findings are consistent with studies in other mouse B cell lines and in human peripheral B cells (29Wang H.Y. Shelburne C.P. Zamorano J. Kelly A.E. Ryan J.J. Keegan A.D. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4385-4389PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the half-life of activated Stat6, cells were pulsed with IL-4 for 15 min, washed, and then incubated in media lacking IL-4. In this case, nuclear Stat6 capable of binding its consensus motif was decreased after 1 h and absent by 2 h (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the kinetics of Stat6 deactivation are rapid, and the half-life of activated Stat6 molecules in the nucleus is less than 1 h. Activated Stat6 capable of binding DNA did not reappear in the cytoplasm, indicating that Stat6 was deactivated or degraded in the nucleus. To determine whether the loss of DNA binding activity paralleled a decrease in phosphorylated Stat6, cells were stimulated for 15 min with IL-4, washed, and incubated in media lacking IL-4. Stat6 was then immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1 C). The results were identical to those obtained by EMSA and revealed that the half-life of phosphorylated Stat6 was less than 1 h after the removal of IL-4. We next examined nuclear extracts to confirm that the disappearance of phosphorylated Stat6 was occurring in the nucleus (Fig. 1 D). Cells were stimulated for 15 min with IL-4, washed, and incubated in media lacking IL-4. Stat6 was then immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts and immunoblotted using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. The results confirmed that the half-life of phosphorylated Stat6 in the nucleus was less than 1 h after the removal of IL-4. As shown in Fig. 1, the half-life of activated Stat6 was less than 1 h, yet a constant level of activated Stat6 was maintained in the nucleus for at least 6 h. We next investigated how long Stat6 activation is sustained in the nucleus. The level of nuclear Stat6 activation remained constant during 72 h of continuous IL-4 treatment (Fig.2 A). Furthermore, activated Stat6 was not detected in the cytoplasm at any time point; thus, Stat6 does not reappear in the cytoplasm in an activated form. We next examined whether de novo protein synthesis was required to maintain Stat6 activation at a constant level. A201.1 cells treated with 5 μg/ml cycloheximide for 48 h exhibited greater than 95% viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion staining (data not shown). Metabolic labeling of cellular proteins with [35S]methionine followed by precipitation of proteins with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and scintillation counting revealed greater than 95% percent inhibition of total protein synthesis after treatment of A201.1 cells with 5 μg/ml CHX for 48 h. Even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis, a constant level of Stat6 activation was maintained out to 48 h in A201.1 cells treated continuously with IL-4 (Fig. 2 B). Next we wanted to examine whether maintenance of Stat6 activation required ongoing Stat6 activation. To examine this, we treated cells with IL-4 for 15 min to achieve maximal Stat6 activation as shown in Fig. 1. Then, in the continued presence of IL-4, the broad spectrum kinase inhibitor, staurosporine, was added to the cell culture medium. We utilized a concentration of 500 nm. At this concentration, staurosporine inhibits both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, and we observed that it effectively prevented any further Stat6 activation. If ongoing Stat6 activation were not required, this should have no effect on the steady state level of Stat6 DNA binding activity in the presence of IL-4. However, we observed that in the presence of staurosporine Stat6 activity quickly waned despite the continuous presence of IL-4 (Fig. 3). In the presence of staurosporine, the half-life of activated Stat6 was only ∼5 min. In contrast, the negative control of Me2SO alone (the vehicle in which staurosporine was reconstituted) had no effect on Stat6 activity. The half-life of Stat6 was more rapid in the presence of staurosporine (∼5 min), despite the continued presence of IL-4, than when the IL-4 was simply removed (Fig. 1). Thus, ongoing kinase activity resulting in phosphorylation of Stat6 molecules is required to maintain Stat6 activation even in the presence of IL-4. These results indicate that in Fig. 2, the molecules of activated Stat6 observed after 72 h of IL-4 stimulation are different from those observed after 15 min. Thus, maintenance of Stat6 activity in the presence of IL-4 requires a cycle of ongoing Stat6 activation, deactivation, and reactivation, and this cycle occurs with a half-life of ∼5 min. To confirm our findings, we utilized the JAK inhibitor, AG590. Cells were treated with IL-4 for 15 min to achieve maximal Stat6 activation. Then, in the continued presence of IL-4, AG490 was added to the cell culture media (Fig. 4). Analogous to our results with staurosporine, we observed that the maintenance of Stat6 activation in the presence of IL-4 required ongoing JAK kinase activity. Furthermore, the half-life of activated Stat6 (about 5 min) approximated what we observed with staurosporine. Our data demonstrated that an ongoing cycle of Stat activation, deactivation, and reactivation was required to maintain Stat6 activation, yet protein synthesis was not required even out to 72 h. We next investigated whether degradation was responsible for the disappearance of activated Stat6 in the nucleus. To do this, we examined the half-life of Stat6 in the presence and absence of IL-4. A201.1 cells were first treated with 5 μg/ml cyclohexamide for 1 h to achieve >95% inhibition of protein synthesis, and then total cellular Stat6 levels were determined over time in the presence and absence of IL-4 (Fig.5). The Stat6 level remained nearly constant for as long as 96 h and was identical in the presence or absence of IL-4. Thus, activated Stat6 is not degraded to a large extent. Our data support that Stat6 is largely deactivated by dephosphorylation in the nucleus. Because Stat6 is not degraded but is dephosphorylated/deactivated in the nucleus, we examined whether the Stat6 pool that is available for activation would be depleted following prior treatment of cells with IL-4, resulting in one cycle of Stat6 activation and deactivation. To address this possibility, cells were treated with IL-4 for 15 min and then incubated in media lacking IL-4 for up to 3 h (Fig.6). As expected, activated Stat6 disappeared after 1 h and remained negligible. Cells were then restimulated with IL-4 at either 2 or 6 h. In both cases, Stat6 activation occurred normally. Thus, the effective pool of Stat6 was not depleted by a prior activation event. Thus far, our data supported a model depicted in Fig. 10, whereby Stat6 is deactivated in the nucleus and then shuttled back to the cytoplasm to be reactivated. Stat6 activation was maintained at a constant level and required ongoing Stat6 cycling (i.e.activation, deactivation, and reactivation) but did not require protein synthesis. Furthermore, the pool did not become significantly depleted or degraded. To further confirm this model, we utilized an inhibitor of nuclear export, leptomycin B (30Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 31Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 967-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which has been shown to inhibit Stat1 nuclear export (32Mowen K. David M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7273-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml leptomycin B (LMB) in the presence of IL-4 for increasing time periods, and then cells were assayed for Stat6 DNA binding activity (Fig.7). The cells remained over 95% viable in the presence of LMB. After 4 h of leptomycin treatment, the level of activated Stat6 started to wane, and after 8 h it was considerably decreased despite the continuous presence of IL-4. Thus, nuclear export is required to maintain Stat6 activation. We did not see an effect at earlier time points, presumably because there was enough Stat6 in the cytoplasm to continue to replenish the activated Stat6.Figure 7Maintenance of Stat6 activation in A201.1 cells requires nuclear export. A201.1 cells were incubated in the presence of IL-4 (10 ng/ml) for the time periods indicated in the presence or absence of LMB (10 ng/ml). Cells remained >95% viable at all time points at this concentration. Nuclear extracts were made and analyzed for the presence of Stat6 DNA binding activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that Stat6 accumulated in the nucleus following LMB treatment, we performed confocal microscopy. Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml LMB in the presence of 10 ng/ml IL-4 for the same time periods used in Fig. 7. Cells were then stained for Stat6 and examined by confocal microscopy (Fig. 8). Cells stained with an isotype-matched control antibody demonstrated no staining. Unstimulated cells or cells treated with IL-4 demonstrated diffuse staining as expected. However, in the presence of LMB, Stat6 accumulated in the nucleus, and by 8 h Stat6 staining was clearly localized to the nucleus. Negligible Stat6 staining was detected in the cytoplasm after 8 h of LMB treatment. These data support that LMB treatment results in the accumulation of Stat6 in the nucleus. Furthermore, the data parallel and confirm our conclusions shown in Fig. 7. Specifically, the level of activated Stat6 was considerably decreased after 8 h of LMB treatment, because it takes 8 h to deplete the cytoplasmic pool of Stat6. Thus, nuclear export is required to maintain Stat6 activation. Maximal Stat6 activation is achieved after 15 min of IL-4 treatment of A201.1 cells. Because the half-life of Stat6 is only 5 min in the absence of ongoing kinase activity, maximal activation requires several rounds of Stat6 activation. We next determined whether one round of maximal Stat6 activation was sufficient for IL-4-dependent gene induction by examining IL-4-dependent CD23 induction on A201.1 cells. Cells were cultured in the presence of IL-4 for 48 h or were pulsed with IL-4 for 15 min, washed, and maintained in culture for a total of 48 h. During continuous IL-4 treatment, we demonstrated that Stat6 activation is maintained at a constant level. In contrast, cells incubated in the presence of IL-4 for only 15 min display maximal Stat6 activation, but this activity wanes and is absent by 2 h. After 48 h of incubation, surface CD23 expression was assessed by flow cytometry. As expected, CD23 expression was increased on cells cultured in the presence of IL-4 for 48 h (Fig.9 A). In contrast, cells treated with IL-4 for 15 min had no CD23 expression above background when examined 48 h later (Fig. 9 A). Fig. 9 Bshows equal levels of nuclear Stat6 activation in cells after 15 min or 48 h of IL-4 stimulation. Thus, the level of activated Stat6 does not directly correlate with CD23 gene induction. Furthermore, transient Stat6 activation after exposure to IL-4 was not sufficient to induce CD23 expression. Next, A201.1 cells were stimulated with IL-4 for time intervals ranging from 15 min to 48 h. After incubation in the presence of IL-4, cells were immediately analyzed for surface expression of CD23 by flow cytometry; alternatively, cells were thereafter maintained in media devoid of IL-4 for a total of 48 h and then analyzed for CD23 expression (Fig. 9 C). A time-dependent increase in CD23 expression was noted in cells treated continuously with IL-4, reaching a maximum at 48 h. In contrast, cells pulsed with IL-4 for less than 36 h had no detectable CD23 on their surface by 48 h. The half-life of activated Stat6 was ∼1 h in all cases following removal of IL-4 (data not shown). CD23 induction required at least 12 h of IL-4 stimulation, but CD23 was not present on the surface 48 h after the onset of IL-4 stimulation. Based on these data, the half-life of surface CD23 in A201.1 is ∼8 h. Thus, CD23 induction required at least 12 h of IL-4 stimulation. Taken together, our data support that sustained Stat6 activation achieved by multiple rounds of Stat6 cycling is required for IL-4-dependent gene induction. Although the mechanisms of the activation of Stat6 have been well studied, the fate of activated Stat6 after IL-4 stimulation was not clear. In this study, we have investigated the life cycle of activated Stat6 and have demonstrated for the first time that continuous cycling of Stat6 is required for IL-4 signaling. In the presence of continuous IL-4 stimulation, a level of maximal Stat6 activation was maintained in the nucleus indefinitely, and this was not dependent on protein synthesis. However, when cells were pulsed with IL-4, we observed that the half-life of phosphorylated Stat6 and Stat6 DNA binding activity was less than 1 h and that the activated Stat6 molecules were deactivated in the nucleus, because activated Stat6 was not detected in the cytoplasm. No significant degradation of Stat6 occurred in the presence or absence of IL-4 for at least 72 h; thus, degradation plays a negligible role in the disappearance of activated Stat6. Maintenance of Stat6 activation required ongoing kinase activity, indicating that in the presence of IL-4 Stat6 is undergoing a continuous cycle of activation and deactivation, followed by reactivation. We propose the following model of the life cycle of activated Stat6 (Fig. 10). There is a large pool of latent cytoplasmic Stat6 monomers, and probably only a small percentage is phosphorylated and transported to the nucleus with each cycle of Stat6 activation. Thus, the cytoplasmic pool is not depleted with a few cycles of Stat6 activation and deactivation. The nuclear import requirements for the Stat proteins remain to be identified. Nuclear localization occurs at the level of both nuclear import and nuclear export (31Ullman K.S. Powers M.A. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 967-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). No nuclear localization signals have been identified in the Stats. However, a recent report revealed the importance of a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) in Stat1 (32Mowen K. David M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7273-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). NES-mediated nuclear export is mediated via the NES receptor, which was identified as the chromosome maintenance (Crm1) gene (33Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar, 34Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). LMB disrupts theCrm1/NES interaction and results in the accumulation of the NES leucine-rich sequence-containing protein in the nucleus. In the study examining Stat1, nuclear accumulation of Stat1 was controlled at least in part at the level of nuclear export, and a critical nuclear export signal in Stat1 was identified. In cells treated with LMB, we observed that nuclear export is necessary for maintenance of Stat6 activation but not until at least 8 h of LMB treatment. We reason that this is because the available cytoplasmic pool is not quickly depleted and there is a reservoir of Stat6 molecules available for activation once the activated Stat6 has been depleted in the nucleus. This was confirmed by our confocal microscopy data demonstrating that Stat6 is trapped in the nucleus after 8 h of LMB treatment. These data support our model that Stat6 is deactivated in the nucleus and then is exported back to the cytoplasm where it can be available for reactivation. This cycle of deactivation, nuclear export, and reactivation is required to maintain Stat6 activation. In the recent report examining nuclear export of Stat1 (32Mowen K. David M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7273-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), Stat1 did not accumulate in the nucleus in Jak1−/− cells. Furthermore, Jak1−/− cells displayed diminished Stat1-mediated gene induction, and it was proposed that Jak1 regulates nuclear export of Stat1. Based on our results here, we propose that Jak1 is required for nuclear accumulation of Stat because Stat needs to be constantly reactivated by Jak1 so that a constant level can be maintained in the nucleus. Our model is consistent with the data and would not invoke a novel function for Jak1. The half-life of the activated Stat6 was less than 1 h. Our results demonstrate that one half-life of Stat6 activation was insufficient for gene induction 48 h later and that sustained Stat6 for at least 12 h was required for IL-4-dependent gene induction. Based on these results, we propose that each cycle of Stat6 activation lasts less than 1 h and that ongoing Stat6 activation, deactivation, cycling, and reactivation are required for gene induction (Fig. 10). The half-life of activated Stat6 in the presence of staurosporine or AG490 is ∼5 min, supporting that a given activated Stat6 molecule is deactivated with a half-life of 5 min. This is consistent with the model that, upon removal of IL-4, Stat6 continues to be phosphorylated for a few more cycles because the half-life of a given phosphorylated Stat6 molecule is only 5 min when kinase activity is blocked by staurosporine. However, upon removal of IL-4, phosphorylated Stat6 disappeared with a half-life of 1 h. Thus, Stat6 continues to undergo a few rounds of phosphorylation and activation following removal of IL-4. We reasoned that a specific nuclear phosphatase was being induced after IL-4 stimulation of cells. Attempts to co-precipitate tyrosine phosphatase activity with nuclear Stat6 were unsuccessful (data not shown). Nevertheless, our data are consistent with a nuclear tyrosine phosphatase acting on activated Stat6. Analogous studies examining Stat1 have implicated tyrosine phosphatases in the regulation of its signaling (23Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 25David M. Grimley P.M. Finbloom D.S. Larner A.C. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It is still possible that some degradation of activated Stat6 also occurs in the nucleus, but we did not observe significant degradation. We propose that the majority of Stat6 monomers recycle to the cytoplasm where they can be reactivated by JAK kinases. In the presence of the kinase inhibitors, staurosporine or AG490, the half-life of activated Stat6 was only 5 min even in the continued presence of IL-4. Thus, the half-life of activated Stat6 molecules is very rapid even in the presence of cytokine stimulation. Because the JAK/Stat pathway is central to so many fundamental biologic processes, the regulation of Stat deactivation is likely to be a tightly regulated process. Rapid deactivation of Stat would be desirable, and a relatively short half-life of activated Stat6 would provide a mechanism to ensure the turning off of Stat signaling quickly. The multiple levels of regulation along the JAK/Stat activation cascade underscore the importance of this pathway. Our data provide novel insights into the fate of activated Stat6 and raise new questions about the requirements for Stat6-mediated gene induction. We propose that Stat6-mediated gene induction requires sustained Stat6 activation involving continuous cycling of Stat6. We thank Dr. Fred D. Finkelman for many helpful discussions and Drs.

This region also confers transactivation by multiple stimulatory pathways, including those involving cAMP/protein kinase A, calcium, phospholipases, protein kinase C, and MAPKs.

Because a stimulatory effect of D2R agonists on MAPKs appears inconsistent with their inhibitory actions on prolactin gene transcription, we examined how D2R activation alters MAPK function in prolactin-secreting cells. We show here that in the pituitary cell line GH4ZR7, dopamine treatment lowers constitutive and hormone-stimulated levels of activated MAPKs, ERK1 and ERK2. The inhibitory response is rapid and dependent on specific heterotrimeric G-proteins and specific MAPK types in that p38 MAPKs are not regulated in a similar manner to ERKs. The effects of MAPKK (MEK1) inhibitors on prolactin transcription parallel those of dopamine and are dependent in part on Pit-1 and ETS-type transcription factors. Finally, dopaminergic inhibition of ERK function is not restricted to transformed pituitary cell lines but is observed also in normal primary pituicytes, suggesting a physiological role for this regulatory mechanism.

GH4ZR7 cells were maintained in Ham's F-10 with 12.5% horse serum and 2.5% fetal calf serum. Transfections were done as previously described (18Lew A.M. Yao H. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12007-12013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For primary culture, the pituitaries were isolated from 3-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and resuspended in defined medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin/streptomycin, 30 μg/ml putrescine, 1 μm hydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 0.375% bovine serum albumin, and 10 pm T3). The cells were separated mechanically by passing progressively through a Pasteur pipette, 18- and 23-gauge needles. Dispersed cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated culture plates and incubated in defined media for 48 h before treatments. Pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαi/o mutants containing C-terminal Cys to Ser substitutions and cloned into expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) were kindly provided by Dr. Paul Albert, University of Ottawa) (12Ghahremani M.H. Forget C. Albert P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GH4ZR7 cells were co-transfected with the mutant Gαi/o subunit constructs and pcDNA3.1/hygromycin vector using electroporation (500 μfarad capacitance, 280 volts) and cultured in Ham's F-10 medium (12.5% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum) containing 300 μg/ml hygromycin-B for 3–4 weeks. Antibiotic-resistant clones were picked (25 clones/transfection) and tested for expression of recombinant Gαi/o RNA transcripts using 32P-labeled probes that recognized 3′ non-coding sequences specific to the vector. Transcript-positive clones were assessed by Western blot for the presence of corresponding Gαi/o proteins. mRNA from GH4ZR7 cells was prepared using oligo-dT cellulose (Collaborative Biomedical Tech.). Blots were probed with random primer labeled ([32P]dATP) cDNAs for Gαi2, Gαo, PRL, GH, or tubulin as previously described (26Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Cells from 6-cm dishes were harvested in 0.2 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, extract protein was quantified by BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL), samples were resolved on SDS 12% polyacrylamide gels at 100 V, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were incubated for 2 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in 1× TBS. The blots were then incubated overnight with primary antibody in fresh 5% nonfat dry milk in 1× TBS followed by a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature. The peroxidase product was developed and exposed to Kodak Blue X-Omat film. ETS mutations of the prolactin promoter were generated by using the PCR method of Kammanet al. (19Kammann M. Laufs J. Schell J. Gronenborn B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 5404Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). First PCR used a wild-type primer specific for either the 5′-end (ccggctcgagcttttaatttaccca) or 3′-end (ggccaagcttgaccacacttccc) of the prolactin promoter and an ETS core mutagenic primer: −212, gattaattacagcaaaaatcgatgagagaaatgctg; −180, tagtggccagaaagtctagattttgattaattacag; and −160, ttctggccactatgagatcttgaatatgaataagaaat. The 150–200 base pair product was used in a second reaction to amplify a full-length promoter. The PCR product was restriction digested usingXhoI and HindIII and ligated into the luciferase-containing vector. Antibodies to ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2, p38, and phospho-p38 (Santa Cruz) were used to measure MAPK phosphorylation by Western analysis. ERK1/2 activity was measured using the p44/42 MAP Kinase Assay kit from Cell Signaling Technology. Immunoprecipitation was done with GH4ZR7 cell extract using immobilized phospho-p44/42 antibody. The precipitate was washed and used in kinase reactions with Elk-1 protein as substrate. The level of ERK activity was determined by Elk-1 phosphorylation in Western blot using anti-phospho-Elk-1 antibody. GH4ZR7 cells were transiently transfected with GFP-ERF expression vector and plated on cover slides coated with poly-l-lysine. After treatment, the cells were washed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Slides were prepared by coating the cells with 90% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline and examined by confocal microscope (Fluoview BX50/PC system). GFP-ERF proteins were visualized using an argon ion laser at 488 nm. Regulation of MAPKs in D2R-expressing GH4ZR7 cells was determined by quantifying the activated (i.e. MAPKK-phosphorylated) form of the enzyme and by measuring the ability of immunoprecipitated MAPKs to phosphorylate the substrate ETS protein, Elk1. Initial studies showed that activated ERK1 and ERK2 are readily detected, and at surprisingly comparable levels, in GH4ZR7 cells cultured in serum-containing or serum-free medium for 24 h, even after removal of the weak estrogenic dye, Phenol Red. 2J. Liu, unpublished data. This serum-independent “basal” level of activated ERKs may derive from stimulatory factors released from (or expressed on) pituitary cells, as suggested by a biphasic pattern of phospho-ERK regulation. As shown in Fig. 1, phospho-ERK levels rapidly decline by 4–5-fold following serum withdrawal but recover to 70% control by 6 h post-withdrawal. Control cells (e.g.NIH3T3) treated in a similar manner showed minimal recovery in phospho-ERK levels over the same time course (Fig. 1). Dopamine regulation of phospho-ERK was examined under basal (serum-free) conditions and in the presence of ERK activators such as the hypothalamic peptide thyrotrophin-releasing hormone. In either case, phospho-ERK1/2 were suppressed 2–3-fold by brief exposure of cells to dopamine (Fig. 2, Aand B). This suppression was observed at dopamine concentrations previously shown to inhibit prolactin gene transcription (5Elsholtz H.P. Lew A.M. Albert P.R. Sundmark V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22919-22925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lew A.M. Yao H. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12007-12013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and was blocked completely by D2R-specific antagonists, sulpiride and spiperone (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). In contrast to ERK1/2, the stress-inducible MAPK, p38, was not inhibited by dopamine (Fig. 2 C), demonstrating selectivity in the MAPK response to D2R activation in GH4ZR7 cells. To further examine the cell context for dopaminergic suppression of ERK1/2, we measured the dopamine response in normal rat pituitary cells. Dispersed primary cultures were prepared in serum-free defined medium and treated with D2 agonists under time and dose conditions found effective using GH4ZR7 cells. In three separate experiments of similar design, dopamine or bromocryptine reduced phospho-ERK levels by 15–30% (Fig. 3), demonstrating that D2R-dependent regulation of MAPK in normal pituicytes parallels the response in the GH4ZR7 model. To assess whether suppression of ERKs by dopamine involves specific G-protein subtypes we examined the sensitivity of this response to pertussis toxin. Pretreatment of GH4ZR7 cells with pertussis toxin had no effect on the basal level of phospho-ERK1/2 or on stimulation of ERK1/2 by TRH, which signals predominantly via Gq-coupled receptors, but prevented dopamine-dependent suppression of ERK1/2 (Fig.4 A), indicative of a Gi/o-coupled response. Mutation of the terminal cysteine residue of Gαi/o-subunits renders them insensitive to ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin, providing a strategy to identify which Gi/o proteins are critical for coupling to specific signaling pathways. We established stable GH4ZR7 clones that express pertussis toxin-resistant forms of Gαi2 and Gαo and examined whether either Gα subtype was required for D2R-dependent inhibition of ERK1/2. RNA analysis using probes specific for the 3′-end of recombinant Gα transcripts, 3R. Baker, unpublished data. together with immunoblot data in Fig. 4 B (inset) identified several cloned GH4ZR7-PTXr lines that express the mutant Gα subtypes. Following pertussis toxin pretreatment and dopamine addition, Gαi2-PTXr-expressing cells behaved similarly to parental controls where suppression of ERK1/2 function by dopamine was completely blocked. In contrast, pertussis toxin was ineffective in blocking dopamine regulation of phospho-ERK levels in Gαo-PTXr-expressing cells (Fig. 4 B), indicating that this Gα subtype may be critical in coupling D2R activation to MAPK regulation. D2R activation in lactotrophs triggers several signaling events that may reduce prolactin synthesis, including a reduction in cAMP levels, inhibition of calcium channels, and a decrease in phosphatidylinositol turnover. Because dopamine potently suppresses basal ERK1/2 function in GH4ZR7 cells and primary pituitary cells, we investigated the impact of this regulatory mechanism on expression of the endogenous prolactin gene. Fig.5 shows that similar to bromocryptine, MEK1 inhibitors U0126 and U0125 cause a 2–3-fold reduction in prolactin RNA transcripts over a 48-h period. Expression of the prolactin-related growth hormone gene and tubulin control were unchanged in response to the treatments. The aminated phenylthiobutadiene U0126 is a more potent inhibitor of MEK1 than the closely related analog U0125 and also a better inhibitor of the endogenous prolactin gene (Fig. 5, at 48 h). To establish a more quantitative relationship between ERK1/2 suppression and decreases in prolactin gene transcription, we compared the ability of MEK1 inhibitors having a wide range of IC50 values for the suppression of ERK1/2 activation (Fig.6 A) to repress prolactin promoter function. Fig. 6 B shows there is a 100-fold range in the potency of PD184352, U0126, and U0125 to inhibit the prolactin promoter, in good agreement with the range and hierarchy of these compounds to block ERK1/2 activation (i.e. PD184352 > U0126 > U0125). Moreover, the selectivity of MEK1 inhibitors for the prolactin promoter is demonstrated by the dopamine-insensitiveRSV promoter (5Elsholtz H.P. Lew A.M. Albert P.R. Sundmark V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22919-22925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was unaffected by even the most potent MEK1 inhibitors (i.e. PD184352 and U0126) at concentrations exceeding 100 μm (Fig. 6 B). We have previously shown that ERF, a ubiquitous transcriptional repressor of the ETS-domain family can selectively inhibit the prolactin gene promoter by interacting at composite ETS/Pit-1-binding sites and potentially other Pit-1 sites (21Day R.N. Liu J. Sundmark V. Kawecki M. Berry D. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31909-31915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, ERF is a direct target for MAPK phosphorylation (22Sgouras D.N. Athanasiou M.A. Beal Jr., G.J. Fisher R.J. Blair D.G. Mavrothalassitis G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4781-4793Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and MAPK activation triggers export of the repressor from nuclei (23Le Gallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4121-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), providing an attractive mechanism for de-repression of gene transcription. We examined by confocal microscopy whether a reduction in basal ERK1/2 function in dopamine- or U0126-treated GH4ZR7 cells could alter the subcellular location of ERF. In untreated cells, a GFP-ERF fusion protein was largely excluded from nuclei, contrasting with a uniformly distributed GFP control (Fig.7 A). Brief exposure of cells to either dopamine or U0126 caused a redistribution of GFP-ERF to nuclei within 10–30 min (Fig. 7 B). These agents had no effect on the distribution of GFP in control cultures,2indicating that ERF sequences were critical for regulating nuclear translocation. Quantification of localization data (Fig. 7 C) demonstrated that nuclear GFP-ERF was detected in <5% of untreated cells, in contrast to >40% in dopamine-treated cultures. Nearly all cells showed nuclear localization of GFP-ERF following exposure to U0126. The dopamine-responsive promoter region of the prolactin gene includes ras-, TRH-, and MAPK-inducible elements that have been mapped to ETS-binding sites centered at −160 and −212 (24Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Tran P.H. Ostrowski M.C. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24639-24648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 25Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20930-20936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We mutated the core GGA(A/T) motifs of these ETS sites in a 450-base pair prolactin promoter. A third potential ETS motif positioned at −180, 3′ to the Pit-1-binding site 3P was also mutated (Fig. 8 A). As shown in Fig. 8 B, dopamine and U0126 inhibited activity of the wild-type prolactin promoter by 40 and 62%, respectively. However, a loss in responsiveness to dopamine and the MEK1 inhibitor was not seen following mutation of Ras/TRH-regulated ETS sites of the prolactin promoter. We have shown that a multimerized 1P Pit-1-binding site (coordinates −62 to −38) is sufficient to confer dopamine inhibition to a minimal TATA box promoter, whereas other binding sites (e.g. Sp1) are not regulated by dopamine (5Elsholtz H.P. Lew A.M. Albert P.R. Sundmark V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22919-22925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 8 B, U0126 also inhibits activity of a 3x1P-TATA promoter but not a 3xSp1-TATA promoter, further demonstrating that dopamine signaling at the nuclear level in GH4ZR7 cells may involve targeting of the ERK1/2 pathway. Consistent with a role for Pit-1 sites in conferring inhibition by U0126, we found that the growth hormone promoter is also suppressed, albeit with lesser efficiency than the prolactin promoter. However, the inability of U0126 to lower steady state levels of growth hormone mRNA (see Fig. 3) argues that in a chromatin context transcriptional responses to MAPK suppression may depend on cooperative interactions that occur in the prolactin gene but not the growth hormone gene. This study demonstrates that dopamine D2R signaling in normal pituitary cells and prolactin-secreting cell lines leads to a reduction in ERK1/2 function. Dopamine not only antagonizes stimulatory effects of exogenous hormones (e.g. TRH) on ERK1/2, but it also suppresses basal levels of activated ERK1/2 observed in serum-free cultures of GH4ZR7 cells and primary pituitary cells. The biphasic pattern of phospho-ERK1/2 regulation, in which an initial sharp decline in phospho-ERK levels under serum-free conditions is followed by a recovery phase, suggests that secreted or membrane-associated autocrine factors may contribute to the elevated basal levels of activated ERK in pituitary cells. Possible candidates may include one or more members of the fibroblast growth factor family that are expressed in GH4 cells and primary pituicytes as these can be potent activators of ERK1/2 in pituitary cultures (7Schweppe R.E. Frazer-Abel A.A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Bradford A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30852-30859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). 4S. Ezzat, personal communication. Efforts to address this issue using immunoneutralization strategies are currently in progress. Although activation of ERK1/2 by Gi/o-protein-coupled receptors, including D2Rs, is now a well established paradigm in several cell-types and tissues (26Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 27Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the mechanism of rapid inhibition of ERK1/2 by this group of receptors is less well understood. In GH4ZR7 cells, dopamine inhibition of ERK1/2 could involve inhibitory effects on calcium channels or adenylate cyclase (18Lew A.M. Yao H. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12007-12013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Albert P.R. Neve K.A. Bunzow J.R. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2098-2104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vallar L. Muca C. Magni M. Albert P. Bunzow J. Meldolesi J. Civelli O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10320-10326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as agents that stimulate either calcium influx/PKC or adenylate cyclase/PKA can also stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Interestingly, two earlier studies using PTX-resistant Gα proteins in GH4 cells (20Senogles S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23120-23127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and fibroblasts (12Ghahremani M.H. Forget C. Albert P.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) demonstrate a requirement for Gi2 in the D2R-mediated inhibition of cAMP. From our study the ability of PTX-resistant Gαo, but not PTX-resistant Gαi2, to rescue dopamine suppression of ERK1/2 suggests that pathways independent of cAMP inhibition may play a significant role. This finding may be of particular interest in understanding transcriptional inhibition of the prolactin gene, as we have previously demonstrated that a GTPase-deficient Gαomutant inhibits prolactin promoter function without causing a decrease in intracellular cAMP (18Lew A.M. Yao H. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12007-12013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitory control of ERK1/2 by dopamine may involve the regulation of specific phosphatases, either dual specificity enzymes that directly target MAPKs or phospho-Ser/Thr or phospho-Tyr phosphatases that might act earlier in the signaling cascade. Florio et al. (30Florio T. Pan M.G. Newman B. Hershberger R.E. Civelli O. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24169-24172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that dopamine can rapidly stimulate a phospho-Tyr phosphatase activity in GH4ZR7 cell membranes, an effect blocked by the antagonist haloperidol and sensitive to pertussis toxin. Activation of somatostatin receptors was unable to stimulate the PTPase activity (30Florio T. Pan M.G. Newman B. Hershberger R.E. Civelli O. Stork P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24169-24172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting functional differences in the signaling pathways evoked by these Gi/o-coupled receptors in GH4ZR7 cells. Among phospho-Ser/Thr phosphatases the ubiquitous PP1 is a possible effector in D2R-mediated ERK1/2 suppression. Inhibition of PP1 can stimulate ERK1/2 signaling in certain prolactin-secreting cell lines (31Manfroid I. Martial J.A. Muller M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) most likely by preventing dephosphorylation of an upstream component in the kinase cascade. A reversal of PP1 inhibition by dopamine could lead to a reduction in activated ERK1/2. Moreover, a PP1- and actin-binding protein, spinophilin/neurabin II (32Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 33Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), has recently been identified in yeast two-hybrid screens as a target for the D2R third intracellular loop (34Smith F.D. Oxford G.S. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19894-19900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), providing a further link between the D2R and PP1. However, although spinophilin is expressed at low levels in various cell types, including those in which D2Rs activate ERK1/2, its role in dopaminergic inhibition of ERK1/2 in lactotrophs remains to be tested. Promoter activity of the prolactin gene is strongly suppressed by MEK1 inhibitors having unique chemical structures with a ranking for suppression of promoter function that corresponds well to the IC50 values for MEK1 inhibition. Although interpretation of kinase inhibitor data is limited by the specificity of such compounds, it is noteworthy from a recent cross-analysis of multiple kinase inhibitors (35Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar) that MEK1 inhibitors (particularly PD184352) demonstrate remarkable target specificity relative to many other kinase inhibitors. In addition, given the prolactin promoter-specific effects of all MEK1 inhibitors tested in our study, it is unlikely that these compounds suppress transcription by a MEK1/ERK-independent mechanism. Hence, together with the RNA blot analysis, these data argue that ERK1/2 activity, whether stimulated by neuroendocrine hormones or maintained at elevated basal levels by autocrine/paracrine pituitary factors, may be required for prolactin gene expression, and thereby provides an effective target for inhibitory control by D2R signaling pathways. The mechanisms involved in transcriptional inhibition by dopamine and MEK1 inhibitors appear to include translocation of the ERF repressor to nuclei and regulation at Pit-1 sites of the prolactin promoter. Although in some fibroblast lines the ERK-sensitive repressor is localized to nuclei following serum withdrawal, requiring the addition of mitogens for nuclear export (23Le Gallic L. Sgouras D. Beal Jr., G. Mavrothalassitis G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4121-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), ERF in GH4ZR7 cells is restricted to the cytoplasm even after prolonged serum withdrawal. A similar distribution is seen in pituitary GHFT-1 cells. 5T. Voss and R. N. Day, personal communication. The ability of dopamine and the MEK inhibitor U0126 to trigger nuclear translocation of ERF, supports the view that D2R-dependent inhibition of ERK1/2 is a requirement for regulation of this transcription repressor. Although our previous data showed that ERF repression can be conferred by the 3P Pit-1/ETS composite site of the prolactin promoter (21Day R.N. Liu J. Sundmark V. Kawecki M. Berry D. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31909-31915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), mutations of this site or a second Pit-1/ETS site (4P) were surprisingly unable to diminish the transcriptional response to dopamine or U0126. Other more proximal ETS elements may therefore be required, or alternatively, ERF may inhibit at non-composite Pit-1 sites as suggested by binding analysis of the prolactin 1P element (21Day R.N. Liu J. Sundmark V. Kawecki M. Berry D. Elsholtz H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31909-31915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the 1P element confers dopamine responsiveness (5Elsholtz H.P. Lew A.M. Albert P.R. Sundmark V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22919-22925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has not previously been considered a target for MAPK regulation based on studies of stimulatory signaling pathways in GH4 cells. Besides serving as a potential site for ERF-dependent repression, the 1P element likely plays a key role in the Pit-1-dependent recruitment of transcriptional coactivators. Dopamine inhibition of ERK1/2 activity may lead to impaired Pit-1/coactivator interactions with a consequent decrease in transactivation. In conclusion, we show that suppression of ERK1/2 activity by dopamine may play a key role in the negative regulation of the prolactin gene. This finding complements studies on the stimulatory control of prolactin, showing that ERK1/2 serves as an integrative node for diverse upstream signals including Gs- (36Le Pechon-Vallee C. Magalon K. Rasolonjanahary R. Enjalbert A. Gerard C. Neuroendocrinology. 2000; 72: 46-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and Gq-coupled receptors (9Wang Y.H. Maurer R.A. Mol Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1094-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), receptor tyrosine kinases that activate ras-dependent (24Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Tran P.H. Ostrowski M.C.

Bertics P.J. Gorski J. Mol Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1872-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Consistent with its inhibitory role in vivo, hypothalamic dopamine may reduce levels of activated ERKs to antagonize this stimulation or suppress basal prolactin gene transcription, which may be maintained in part by local pituitary-derived signals. Finally, although inhibition of ERK1/2 is generally viewed as a restorative mechanism that follows an acute or protracted stimulatory phase, our experiments support a model in which some Gi/o-coupled receptors, or as shown recently some receptor tyrosine kinases (37Miao H. Wei B.R. Peehl D.M., Li, Q. Alexandrou T. Schelling J.R. Rhim J.S. Sedor J.R. Burnett E. Wang B. Nat.

As a result of a defect in klotho gene expression, the kl −/− mouse exhibits multiple age-associated disorders, such as arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, skin atrophy, pulmonary emphysema, short life span, and infertility. However, the mechanism by which the klotho gene product suppresses the aging phenomena has not been identified. Analysis of the pathophysiology of kl −/− mice is expected to give clues not only to understanding the mechanisms of individual diseases associated with aging but also the relationship between these mechanisms during human aging. Non-erythroid spectrin is a heterodimeric actin-binding protein that consists of αII- and βII-spectrin and is usually found on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane (3Winkelmann J.C.

Calpain, a calcium-dependent cytosolic cysteine protease, is involved in many physiological and pathological processes (14Vanderklish P.W. Bahr B.A. Int. J. Exp.

Thus, calpain overactivation may contribute to the pathology of cerebral and cardiac ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, and cataract formation (19Lee M.S. Kwon Y.T., Li, M. Peng J. Friedlander R.M. Tsai L.H. Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 20Wang K.K. Yuen P.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 412-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Calpain has been shown to be regulated by both calcium ion and calpastatin (16Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Two types of isozymic calpain, μ-calpain and m-calpain, are ubiquitously distributed in mammalian cells. The former is activated by micromolar concentrations of calcium and the latter is activated by millimolar concentrations of calcium. Calpastatin is an endogenous inhibitor specific for calpain, but is slowly degraded by calpain (21Nakamura M. Inomata M. Imajoh S. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Here, we report the cleavage of αII-spectrin due to the continuous activation of μ-calpain in kl −/− mice. Furthermore, we also observe similar phenomena in normal aged mice. Kidneys were obtained from 2- and 3-week-old kl +/+,kl +/−, and kl −/− mice and from 4-week-old and 29-month-old C57BL/6 mice. Brain, lung, heart, liver, and kidney were obtained from 4-week-old and 8-week-oldkl +/+ and kl −/− mice. Tissue samples were homogenized with 9 volumes (weight/volume) of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose. After centrifugation at 900 ×g for 10 min, the supernatant was subjected to ultra centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants and precipitates were used as the cytosolic fraction and microsomal membrane fraction, respectively. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). All experimental procedures using laboratory animals were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals used and their suffering. Kidney microsomal fraction (250 μg) from 4-week-old kl +/+ andkl −/− mice was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. A protein band of ∼280 kDa was excised and treated with 0.1 μg of Achromobacter protease I (lysylendopeptidase) at 37 °C for 12 h in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 0.1% SDS and 1 mm EDTA (22Masaki T. Tanabe M. Nakamura K. Soejima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 660: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The peptides were separated on columns of DEAE-5PW (1 × 20 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and CAPCELL PAK C18 UG120 (1 × 100 mm; Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan). Solvent A was 0.085% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in distilled water, and solvent B was 0.075% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 80% (v/v) acetonitrile. The peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 30 μl/min using a linear gradient of 1–60% solvent B. Selected peptides were subjected to Edman degradation using a Procise 494 cLC protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a Reflex MALDI-TOF (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) in linear mode using 2-mercaptobenzothiazole as a matrix. Rabbit antibodies specific to the pre- and post-autolytic forms of μ-calpain (anti-pre-μ and anti-post-μ, respectively) were raised against synthetic peptides as described previously (23Saido T.C. Nagao S. Shiramine M. Tsukaguchi M. Sorimachi H. Murofushi H. Tsuchiya T. Ito H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific to the pre- and post-autolytic forms of m-calpain (anti-pre-m and anti-post-m, respectively) were produced using synthetic peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 21 residues (AGIAAKLAKDREAAEGLGSHE) of the intact form and the N-terminal 6 residues (KDREAA) of the autolytic form, respectively. A cysteine residue was added to the C terminus of each peptide so that the antigenic peptide could be conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The entire amino acid sequence and the autolytic cleavage site of human m-calpain were obtained from previous reports (24Imajoh S. Aoki K. Ohno S. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Sugihara H. Suzuki K. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8122-8128Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 25Brown N. Crawford C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 322: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific to the calpain-generated N- and C-terminal fragments of αII-spectrin (136 and 148 kDa, respectively) were produced by the peptide antigens QQQEVY (anti-BDP-136) and GAMPRD (anti-BDP-148), respectively (see Fig. 2). A cysteine residue was added to the N terminus of QQQEVY peptide or was added to the C terminus of GAMPRD peptide. The amino acid sequence and the cleavage site in mouse αII-spectrin by calpain were as determined by others previously (22Masaki T. Tanabe M. Nakamura K. Soejima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 660: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 26Sri Widada J. Asselin J. Colote S. Marti J. Ferraz C. Trave G. Haiech J. Liautard J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 455-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). An antibody against domain IV of human calpastatin was produced using a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 601–630 (AEHRDKLGERDDTIPPEYRHLLDDNGQDKP) (27Asada K. Ishino Y. Shimada M. Shimojo T. Endo M. Kimizuka F. Kato I. Maki M. Hatanaka M. Murachi T. J. Enzyme Inhib. 1989; 3: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with a cysteine residue added to the C terminus. Rabbits were immunized with the antigenic peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates. Affinity purification of polyclonal antibodies was carried out using antigenic peptides immobilized on epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Anti-human-αII-spectrin polyclonal antibody C-20 from goat was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Klotho monoclonal antibody (KM2076) from rat was a generous gift from Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co., Ltd (28Kato Y. Arakawa E. Kinoshita S. Shirai A. Furuya A. Yamano K. Nakamura K. Iida A. Anazawa H. Koh N. Iwano A. Imura A. Fujimori T. Kuro-o M. Hanai N. Takeshige K. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 597-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The cytosolic and microsomal fractions (15 μg each) were separated by SDS-PAGE (10 and 5% gel for cytosolic and microsomal fractions, respectively), and proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane, after blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk and 0.5% Tween 20, was incubated with each antibody. Then the membrane was treated with anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Proteins bound to antibody were visualized with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was isolated from 4-week-old kl +/+ andkl −/− mice kidney by the guanidinium thiocyanate method using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan). Total RNA (15 μg) was electrophoresed through a 1% agarose-formaldehyde denaturing gel and transferred to a nylon membrane, Hybond-N+ (Amersham Biosciences). Northern blot analysis was performed using The Gene images AlkPhos Direct (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Probe DNA fragments for mouse αII-spectrin, calpastatin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were prepared by reverse transcriptase-PCR and nested PCR using total RNA from thekl +/+ mouse kidney. Outer primers of αII-spectrin were 5′-AACAGCACAAACAAGGATTGGTGG-3′ and 5′-TGCAGATCATGGGAGTCACCCAAT-3′; inner primers were 5′-GGTTTCGTGCCAGCTGCATA-3′ and 5′-ACCCAATTTGGCCTTGCGCT-3′. Outer primers of calpastatin were 5′-TTTCGCTGCGTTTTCCCGGA-3′ and 5′-TTCTCCTTGGGGGGAACAGA-3′; inner primers are 5′-TTCACCGAAAAATGTCCCAGCCCGG-3′ and 5′-GGTCACTCCTGCAGACTGAGCTTTG-3′. Primers of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-TGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGC-3′ and 5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′. Four-week-old and 3-week-old (kl +/+ and kl −/−) mice were examined. The kidneys were excised, fixed with 10% formaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned in 4-μm slices and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and von Kossa staining. To determine whether mouse homozygotes of the klotho gene mutation (kl −/−) have a different pattern of proteins in the kidney, we examined the kidney microsomal fractions from 4-week-old mice by SDS-PAGE. A band of about 280 kDa was found to be significantly weaker inkl −/− mice than inkl +/+ mice (Fig.1 A). Similar results were obtained with five other kl −/− mice. The 280-kDa protein band was subjected to in-gel lysylendopeptidase digestion (22Masaki T. Tanabe M. Nakamura K. Soejima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 660: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and the sequences of two of the resulting peptides were determined to be LQTASDESYK and KHEAFETDFTVHK by a combination of Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. A data base search of protein sequences revealed that these peptide sequences were homologous to those of human αII-spectrin (GenBankTMaccession number AAB41498). A Western blot using an anti-αII-spectrin antibody (C-20) confirmed that the 280-kDa protein is αII-spectrin and that the reactivity of the antibody was drastically decreased inkl −/− mice (Fig. 1 B). The antibody also stained a 145-kDa band in kl −/− mice, but this band was below the detectable level inkl +/+ mice (Fig. 1 B). Because the anti-αII-spectrin antibody recognizes the C terminus of αII-spectrin, it is likely that the 145-kDa band is a C-terminal fragment of αII-spectrin. Although the kidney of 4-week-old kl −/− mice was not morphologically different from that of kl +/+mice, it did show a small amount of calcification (Fig. 1,C–F). αII-Spectrin was previously shown to be cleaved at a particular site by calpain (29Harris A.S. Croall D.E. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15754-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yielding 136- and 148-kDa fragments. To determine whether calpain is involved in proteolysis of αII-spectrin in the kidney of kl −/− mice, we prepared specific antibodies to sequences on either side of the cleavage site (Fig.2). The anti-BDP-136 antibody, which was produced against a sequence (QQQEVY) in the C-terminal region of BDP-136, recognized only the 136-kDa fragment of αII-spectrin. BDP-136 was detected only inkl −/− mice (Fig.3 A). On the other hand, the anti-BDP-148 antibody, which was produced against a sequence (GAMPRD) in the N-terminal region of BDP-148, recognized not only the 148 kDa fragment but also full-length αII-spectrin. BDP-148 was detected only in kl −/− mice (Fig.3 B). These results indicated that αII-spectrin was degraded by calpain in the kidney of kl −/−mice. To determine which of the calpain isozymes were activated in thekl −/− kidney, we made a Western blot of kidney cytosolic fractions using antibodies against four types of calpain: the inactive and active forms of μ-calpain (pre- and post-μ-calpain) and the inactive and active forms of m-calpain (pre- and post-m-calpain). Pre-μ-calpain was detected inkl +/+ mice but not inkl −/− mice (Fig. 3 C). Post-μ-calpain was detected in kl −/− mice but not in kl +/+ mice (Fig. 3 D). Pre-m-calpain was detected in both kl +/+ andkl −/− mice with no significant difference between them (Fig. 3E). Post-m-calpain was barely detected in eitherkl +/+ or kl −/− mice (Fig. 3 F). These results indicate that μ-calpain, but not m-calpain, was specifically activated in thekl −/− kidney. Interestingly, calpastatin, which is an endogenous inhibitor of calpain, was barely detected inkl −/− mice (Fig. 3 G). The triplet bands at about 122 kDa in Fig. 3 G are probably alternative splicing forms of calpastatin (30Takano J. Kawamura T. Murase M. Hitomi K. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The expression levels of mRNAs of calpastatin (Fig. 3 H) and αII-spectrin (Fig. 3 I) were not different between kl −/− and kl +/+mice, which suggests that the decreases of calpastatin and αII-spectrin in kl −/− mice were due to increased degradation rather than a down-regulation of transcription. To elucidate the relation between the amount of Klotho protein and the degree of μ-calpain activation, we examined the mouse heterozygotes for the klotho mutation (kl +/−). The expression level of Klotho protein in 2-week-oldkl +/− mice (Fig.4 A, lane 2), was approximately half that in 2-week-old kl +/+ mice (lane 1). A similar relation was found in 3-week-old mice (lanes 5 and 4, respectively). The levels of expression of pre-μ-calpain, post-μ-calpain, and calpastatin in 2-week-old kl +/− mice (lane 2) were intermediate between those of kl +/+ mice (lane 1) and those of kl −/− mice (lane 3). Similar results were obtained in 3-week-old mice (lanes 5, 4, and 6, respectively). These results showed that the expression level of Klotho protein affected the activation of μ-calpain and the amount of calpastatin (Fig. 4 B). To elucidate the process of calpain activation, calpastatin decrement, and αII-spectrin proteolysis, we examined mice that were less than 4 weeks old. In kl −/− mice, pre-μ-calpain and calpastatin were present at low levels at 2 weeks (Fig. 4 A, lane 3) but were undetectable at 3 weeks (lane 6), while the amount of cleaved αII-spectrin was much higher at 3 weeks (lane 6) and 4 weeks than at 2 weeks (lane 3). In 2- and 3-week-old kl +/− mice (lanes 2 and5), the amount of cleaved αII-spectrin was much higher at 3 weeks (lane 5) than at 2 weeks (lane 2), while the levels of pre-μ-calpain and calpastatin at 3 weeks were slightly less than those at 2 weeks. These findings suggest that: 1) pre-μ-calpain and calpastatin were originally expressed inkl −/− mouse kidney and that μ-calpain was gradually activated and calpastatin was gradually decreased during development, and 2) αII-spectrin was hardly cleaved in the presence of calpastatin, but intensive cleavage of αII-spectrin was observed after the complete disappearance of calpastatin (Fig. 4 B). No calcification was observed in 3-week-old kl −/− mice (data not shown), indicating that degradation of αII-spectrin in the kidney of kl −/− mice preceded the occurrence of any tissue damage. The susceptibility and degree of proteolysis due to the klotho mutation varied among different organs. Changes in the lung of 4-week-oldkl −/− mice (Fig.5) were similar to those observed in the kidney. The intensity of intact αII-spectrin drastically decreased and lower molecular weight bands newly appeared. In addition, post-μ-calpain, but not pre-μ-calpain, was detected, suggesting that significant proteolysis occurred in the lung. It may be relevant to that the first observation of the pulmonary emphysematous changes occurs at 4 weeks of age in kl −/− mice (31Suga T. Kurabayashi M. Sando Y. Ohyama Y. Maeno T. Maeno Y. Aizawa H. Matsumura Y. Kuwaki T. Kuro O.M. Nabeshima Y. Nagai R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 22: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the heart, partial activation of calpain was observed at 4 weeks, and only post-μ-calpain was detected at 8 weeks. However, αII-spectrin was not cleaved in the heart. These results suggest that the heart has a sufficient amount of calpastatin to prevent αII-spectrin degradation. On the other hand, no αII-spectrin degradation or calpain activation was observed in the brain or liver at 8 weeks. Changes similar to those observed in kl −/− mice occurred in aged normal (C57BL/6) mice. As normal mice aged from 4 weeks to 29 months, the expression of Klotho protein decreased, the activation of μ-calpain increased, the level of calpastatin considerably decreased, and the degradation of αII-spectrin increased (Fig.6). Similar changes were observed in five other mice. Our results show that the aberrant activation of μ-calpain and the decrease of calpastatin in the kidney are caused by theklotho mutation, and such changes lead to the cleavage of αII-spectrin. These phenomena are well correlated with the expression level of Klotho protein. Our results also show that similar changes in μ-calpain, calpastatin, and αII-spectrin occur in normal aged mice. The abnormal activation of μ-calpain in the kidney occurs at an early age: inkl −/− mice, changes in μ-calpain activation and αII-spectrin degradation started to occur one to 2 weeks before the appearance of abnormal phenotypes, and inkl +/− mice, μ-calpain was gradually activated as they aged, even though these mice have a normal phenotypic appearance. Our finding that μ-calpain, but not m-calpain, was activated in the kidney of kl −/− mice suggests that the concentration of intracellular calcium ions in these mice is in the micromolar range. Normally calpain is activated temporarily and calpain-catalyzed proteolysis leads to modulation rather than destruction of the substrate proteins. Therefore, continuous activation of μ-calpain is unusual and elucidation of the mechanism is essential to understanding its pathophysiological role. One possible mechanism is that μ-calpain overactivation causes a deficiency of calpastatin, and another is that a decrease in calpastatin causes an increase in μ-calpain activation. Since the transcription levels of calpastatin are the same in kl −/− andkl +/+mice, the latter possibility is unlikely, but we cannot completely rule it out. μ-Calpain activity, in addition to being regulated by the calcium ion concentration, is usually also regulated by the binding of calpastatin (16Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Thus, a deficiency of calpastatin may induce the overdestruction of substrates such as αII-spectrin by calpain. The mechanism by which Klotho protein might regulate μ-calpain activity and calpastatin level in the kidney is unknown. However, it is possible that this regulation is mediated by nitric oxide (NO). NO has been shown to inhibit calpain-mediated proteolysis (32Koh T.J. Tidball J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C806-C812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and systemic NO synthesis is decreased in kl −/− mice (33Saito Y. Yamagishi T. Nakamura T. Ohyama Y. Aizawa H. Suga T. Matsumura Y. Masuda H. Kurabayashi M. Kuro-o M. Nabeshima Y. Nagai R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 34Nagai R. Saito Y. Ohyama Y. Aizawa H. Suga T. Nakamura T. Kurabayashi M. Kuroo M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Furthermore, adenovirus-mediated klotho gene delivery increased NO production and restored vascular endothelial dysfunction (35Saito Y. Nakamura T. Ohyama Y. Suzuki T. Iida A. Shiraki-Iida T. Kuro-o M. Nabeshima Y. Kurabayashi M. Nagai R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that calpain overactivation inkl −/− mice is not caused by ischemia due to arteriosclerosis, while ischemia would cause overactivation of calpain (13Tsuji T. Ohga Y. Yoshikawa Y. Sakata S. Abe T. Tabayashi N. Kobayashi S. Kohzuki H. Yoshida K.I. Suga H. Kitamura S. Taniguchi S. Takaki M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H1286-H1294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study revealed that, in kl −/−mice, arteriosclerosis first appeared around 4 weeks after birth and progressed gradually with age (1Kuro-o M. Matsumura Y. Aizawa H. Kawaguchi H. Suga T. Utsugi T. Ohyama Y. Kurabayashi M. Kaname T. Kume E. Iwasaki H. Iida A. Shiraki-Iida T. Nishikawa S. Nagai R. Nabeshima Y.I. Nature. 1997; 390: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar). However, in the lung and kidney inkl −/− mice, arteriosclerosis could not be the cause of overactivation of μ-calpain, because the latter occurred as early as 2∼3 weeks. The degree of proteolysis and of activation of calpain caused by theklotho mutation varied among different organs. Both αII-spectrin degradation and calpain activation were observed in the kidney and lung as early as 2∼3 weeks. Spectrin was not cleaved in the heart even at 8 weeks, while overactivation of calpain was observed. The time course of activation of calpain in the heart seemed to be proceeded slower than in the lung and kidney. However, it is impossible to examine this possibility, becausekl −/− mice die at ∼8–9 weeks (1Kuro-o M. Matsumura Y. Aizawa H. Kawaguchi H. Suga T. Utsugi T. Ohyama Y. Kurabayashi M. Kaname T. Kume E. Iwasaki H. Iida A. Shiraki-Iida T. Nishikawa S. Nagai R. Nabeshima Y.I. Nature. 1997; 390: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2841) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no αII-spectrin degradation or calpain activation was observed in the brain or liver at 8 weeks. In addition, an organ's susceptibility to the klotho mutation did not necessarily correspond to its expression of klotho mRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that Klotho protein or its metabolites may function as a humoral factor. In support of this hypothesis, both mice and human have a secretory form of Klotho protein (28Kato Y. Arakawa E. Kinoshita S. Shirai A. Furuya A. Yamano K. Nakamura K. Iida A. Anazawa H. Koh N.

It is important to identify and characterize a target molecule (receptor) that is responsive to Klotho protein or its metabolites. Thus, it may be that the factor most responsible for an organ's sensitivity to theklotho mutation is the density of such a receptor. Our finding that normal aged mice show changes similar to those inkl −/− mice suggests that the decrease of Klotho protein is closely related to aging processes. Recent studies revealed that the expression of klotho gene was gradually reduced in the rat kidney during long term hypertension (39Aizawa H. Saito Y. Nakamura T. Inoue M. Imanari T. Ohyama Y. Matsumura Y. Masuda H. Oba S. Mise N. Kimura K. Hasegawa A. Kurabayashi M. Kuro-o M. Nabeshima Y. Nagai R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, humans with chronic renal failure commonly develop multiple complications resembling phenotypes observed inkl −/− mice (41London G.M. Drueke T.B.

Fujimori T. Nishiguchi S. Tamori A. Shiomi S. Nakatani T. Sugimura K. Kishimoto T. Kinoshita S. Kuroki T. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that Klotho protein in the kidney protects the progress of age-related renal disorders. Based on the above results, we propose that tissue deterioration during aging is caused by a decrease of Klotho protein, which leads to a decrease of calpastatin and activation of μ-calpain, which leads to a degradation of cytoskeletal components such as spectrin. The magnitude of each of these effects correlates with the amount of Klotho expression. A decrease of calpastatin accelerates the activation of μ-calpain and vice versa. Such deterioration may trigger tissue abnormalities in kl −/− mice and aged mice, but Klotho protein may suppress these processes, while the detailed mechanism is not clear yet. Very recently Yoshida et al.(47Yoshida T. Fujimori T. Nabeshima Y. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) reported that calcium and phosphorus homeostasis could be regulated through Klotho function via the action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D due to the impaired regulation of 1α-hydroxylase gene expression. This deterioration in the vitamin D3 endocrine system may participate in many of the phenotypes in kl −/− mice via toxicity due to increased levels of calcium, phosphorus, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. It should be noted that when serum concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D are restored to normal levels, many of phenotypes are improved despite Klotho protein deficiency. 1T. Fujimori, H. Tsujikawa, and Y. Nabeshima, unpublished results. Thus, Klotho protein may be a regulator of calcium homeostasis via the vitamin D3 endocrine system. Alternatively, based on the homology to β-glucosidase (1Kuro-o M. Matsumura Y. Aizawa H. Kawaguchi H. Suga T. Utsugi T. Ohyama Y. Kurabayashi M. Kaname T. Kume E. Iwasaki H. Iida A. Shiraki-Iida T.

Biochem. 1991; 200: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), Klotho protein may function as a glycosidase-like enzyme and modify the glycan moieties of ion channels. Since it is known that glycosylation appears important for the function of ion channels (48Gurnett C.A., De Waard M. Campbell K.P. Neuron. 1996; 16: 431-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 49Thornhill W.B., Wu, M.B. Jiang X., Wu, X. Morgan P.T. Margiotta J.F. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1997; 109: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the change of glycosylation may affect calcium homeostasis. In any case, the abnormal activation of calpain due to the decrease of Klotho protein leads to degradation of cytoskeletal elements such as αII-spectrin is likely to be integral to the pathogenic sequence inkl −/− mice and recapitulates effects seen in normal aging. Future studies are needed to determine the definitive role of Klotho protein in the regulation of calcium metabolism as well as of intracellular calcium concentration. Such studies will also lead to a better understand of age-related renal abnormalities and to prevent renal diseases in the future.

Peptide libraries were used to profile the substrate specificity of MMP-26 from the P4–P4′ sites. The optimal cleavage motifs for MMP-26 were Lys-Pro-Ile/Leu-Ser(P1)-Leu/Met(P1′)-Ile/Thr-Ser/Ala-Ser. The strongest preference was observed at the P1′ and P2 sites where hydrophobic residues were favored. Proline was preferred at P3, and Serine was preferred at P1. The overall specificity was similar to that of other MMPs with the exception that more flexibility was observed at P1, P2′, and P3′. Accordingly, synthetic inhibitors of gelatinases and collagenases inhibited MMP-26 with similar efficacy. A pair of stereoisomers had only a 40-fold difference inK iapp values against MMP-26 compared with a 250-fold difference against neutrophil collagenase, indicating that MMP-26 is less stereoselective for its inhibitors. MMP-26 autodigested itself during the folding process. Two of the major autolytic sites were Leu49–Thr50 and Ala75–Leu76, which still left the cysteine switch sequence (PHC82GVPD) intact. This suggests that Cys82 may not play a role in the latency of the zymogen. Interestingly, inhibitor titration studies revealed that only ∼5% of the total MMP-26 molecules was catalytically active, indicating that the thiol groups of Cys82 in the active molecules may be dissociated or removed from the active site zinc ions. MMP-26 cleaved Phe352–Leu353 and Pro357–Met358 in the reactive loop of α1-proteinase inhibitor and His140–Val141 in insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1, probably rendering these substrates inactive.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that MMPs may play important roles in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in physiological processes (2Shapiro S.D. Curr. Opin.

Excessive breakdown of the ECM by MMPs is observed in pathological conditions including periodontitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis. MMPs also participate in tumor cell invasion and metastasis by degrading the basement membrane and other ECM components and allowing the cancer cells to gain access to blood and lymphatic vessels (4Johansson N. Ahonen M. Kähäri V.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Analyses of a large number of peptide and protein substrates and more recent work with phage display and synthetic peptide libraries have led to the identification of consensus cleavage site motifs for a number of different MMPs (5Netzel-Arnett S.

The substrate specificities of MMPs are quite similar to each other, showing strong preferences for hydrophobic residues at P1′. Although distinct MMPs often prefer the same type of amino acid residues at corresponding positions surrounding the cleavage site, differences in the orders of preference for specific residues at each position may more precisely determine MMP specificity for substrates. Endometase (matrilysin-2/MMP-26) is the smallest member of the MMP family, with a molecular mass of 28 kDa (14Park H.I., Ni, J. Gerkema F.E. Liu D. Belozerov V.E. Sang Q.-X.A. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, the specificity constant profile of peptide substrates with MMP-26 was quite different from that with MMP-12 and MMP-3 (14Park H.I., Ni, J. Gerkema F.E. Liu D. Belozerov V.E.

According to protein substrate studies in vitro, MMP-26 might process matrix proteins such as fibronectin, vitronectin, fibrinogen, type IV collagen, gelatinase B (MMP-9), and gelatin (14Park H.I., Ni, J.

A significant level of expression in normal tissues was found only in the uterus and placenta. The limited occurrence of MMP-26 in normal tissues suggests that the production of this enzyme may be strictly regulated during specific events, such as implantation, and that MMP-26 could be a target enzyme for the treatment of cancer and other pathological conditions. The biological function and substrate specificity of MMP-26 are not yet fully understood. According to the protein substrate studies in vitro, it may participate in ECM degradation. In this study, we take a step forward toward understanding the biochemical properties and functions of MMP-26 by identifying the cleavage sites of protein and peptide substrates, characterizing the substrate specificities of MMP-26 and measuring the potencies of synthetic inhibitors. Dnp-Pro-Leu-Gly-Met-Trp-Ser-Arg-OH, Dnp-Pro-Leu-Ala-Tyr-Trp-Ala-Arg-OH, Mca-Pro-β-cyclohexylalanyl-Gly-Nva-His-Ala-Dpa-NH2, Mca-Pro-Leu-Ala-Nva-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), and MMP-specific synthetic inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem, and Dnp-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Trp-Ala-d-Arg-NH2 and Mca-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Val-Glu-Nva-Trp-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-NH2were purchased from Bachem. Hydroxamic acid derivatives of amino acids, buffers, cysteine, α1-protease inhibitor (α1-PI), and 1,10-phenanthroline were purchased from Sigma. Metal salts, Brij-35, sodium dodecyl sulfate, dithioerythreitol, and 2-mercaptoethanol were purchased from Fisher. Peptide libraries were synthesized at the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA) as described previously (12Turk B.E. Huang L.L. Piro E.T. Cantley L.C. Nature Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). MMP-26 was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies from transformed E. colicells as described previously (14Park H.I., Ni, J. Gerkema F.E. Liu D. Belozerov V.E. Sang Q.-X.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20540-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The inclusion bodies were isolated and purified using B-PERTM bacterial protein extraction reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The insoluble protein was dissolved in 8 m urea to ∼5 mg/ml. The protein solution was diluted to ∼100 μg/ml in 8 m urea and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h, dialyzed in 4m urea, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mmHEPES, or Tricine, pH 7.5, for at least 1 h and then folded by dialysis in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES or Tricine, 0.2m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 20 μm ZnSO4, 0.01% Brij-35, pH 7.5, for 16 h. To enhance the activity of MMP-26, the folded enzyme was dialyzed twice for 24 h at 4 °C in the folding buffer without Zn2+ ion. The total enzyme concentration was measured by UV absorption using ε280 = 57130m−1 cm−1, which was calculated by Genetics Computer Group software. The methods were performed as described previously (12Turk B.E. Huang L.L. Piro E.T. Cantley L.C. Nature Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity for the primed positions (18Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4765) Google Scholar), an amino-terminally acetylated dodecamer peptide mixture (1 mm) consisting of a roughly equimolar mixture of the 19 naturally occurring l-amino acids excluding cysteine at each site was incubated with MMP-26 in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 at 37 °C until 5–10% of the peptides were digested. An aliquot (10 μl) of the mixture was subjected to automated amino-terminal peptide sequencing. The data in each sequencing cycle were normalized to the total molar amount of amino acids in that cycle so that a value of 1 indicated the average value. Undigested peptides and the amino-terminal fragments of digested peptides are amino-terminally blocked and therefore do not contribute to the sequenced pool. The specificity of the unprimed side was determined by libraries with the sequence MAXXXXXLRGAARE(K-biotin) for the P3 site and MAXXPXXLRGGGEE(K-biotin) for other sites, where X represents a degenerate position, K-biotin is ε-(biotinamidohexanoyl)lysine, and the amino terminus is unblocked. Libraries were partially digested with MMP-26 as described above, quenched with EDTA (10 mm), and treated in batch with 400 μl of avidin-agarose resin (Sigma). The mixture was transferred to a column, which was washed with 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The unbound fraction was evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, suspended in water, and sequenced. Data were normalized as described above. Assays of fluorescent peptide substrates were performed by following the procedures reported in the literature (14Park H.I., Ni, J. Gerkema F.E. Liu D.

Van Wart H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For substrates containing the tryptophan residue, the fluorescence was observed at an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and emission wavelength of 360 nm, and for substrates containing 3-methoxycoumarin, fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 328 nm and emission wavelength of 393 nm. All of the kinetic experiments were conducted in 50 mm HEPES buffer containing 10 mm CaCl2, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.01% Brij-35. To assess inhibition potency for tight binding inhibitors, the apparent inhibitor dissociation constants (K iapp values) were calculated by fitting the data to Morrison's equation (19Morrison J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 185: 269-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). The inhibitor dissociation constants (K i values) were determined by Dixon's plot (20Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1974; 137: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) for less potent inhibitors. The inhibition assays were performed with a peptide substrate (1 μm), Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2, and 5–10 different inhibitor concentrations. The substrate stock solutions were prepared in Me2SO and then further diluted to 50% Me2SO in water. The final Me2SO concentration in the assays was 1%. The inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO to 5 or 2 mm and diluted with methanol with the exception of inhibitor IV (Calbiochem catalogue number: 444250), which was dissolved in assay buffer. The final methanol concentration in the inhibition assays was 5% (v/v). The specificity constants (k cat/K m values) were determined by the equation V = (k cat/K m)[E][S], which is modified from the Michaelis-Menten equation when [S] ≪K m. The enzyme became a mixture of several states after partial activation by dialysis. The total concentration of 400 nm MMP-26 was measured by absorption at 280 nm and calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 57,130 m−1cm−1. The enzyme was titrated with MMP inhibitor I (GM-6001) to determine the concentration of catalytically active MMP-26. The titration analysis revealed the concentration of active MMP-26 to be 21 nm, which was ∼5% of the total protein concentration after dialysis. For an accurate titration, the concentration of an enzyme is required to be at least 100-fold more than the inhibition constant of the titrant (21Copeland R.A. Enzymes: a Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism, and Data Analysis.2nd Ed. Wiley-VCH, Inc., New York2000: 305-349Crossref Google Scholar). To avoid the depletion of substrate by a high MMP-26 concentration, a less specific substrate, Mca-Arg-Pro-Lys-Pro-Val-Glu-Nva-Trp-Arg-Lys(Dnp)-NH2, designed for MMP-3 (22Nagase H. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20952-20957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used for detection of the initial rate. The cleavage of this substrate by MMP-26 was the slowest among peptide substrates studied in our laboratory (14Park H.I., Ni, J. Gerkema F.E. Liu D. Belozerov V.E. Sang Q.-X.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20540-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). IGFBP-1, α1-PI, and MMP-26 solutions were diluted or dissolved in 50 mm HEPES buffer at pH 7.5 containing 10 mm CaCl2, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.01% Brij-35. IGFBP-1 (4 μg) and MMP-26 (0.63 μg) in a total volume of 50 μl were incubated for 2 days at room temperature. Each day, 10 μl of reaction mixture was taken, and the reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min after 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm EDTA was added. The cleaved products were separated by a 12% acrylamide gel and detected by silver staining. For cleavage of α1-PI, 90 μg of α1-PI were incubated with 1.3 μg of MMP-26 in a total volume of 100 μl. The samples were collected after 1 h, 1day, and 2 days. The cleaved products were separated by a 15% SDS-PAGE and detected by silver staining. The cleavage sites of fluorogenic peptide substrates and α1-PI were determined by measuring the mass of the cleavage products with a Bruker protein time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The reaction mixture was mixed with an equivalent volume of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinamic acid (4.5 mg/ml in 50% CH3CN, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid) matrix solution containing synthetic peptide calibrants. Because the high salt concentration increased the noise in the mass spectra, the digestion reaction was performed with 10 mm HEPES buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 overnight at room temperature. For fluorogenic substrates, MMP-9 was used as a positive control. The substrate specificity of MMP-26 was investigated using a recently described peptide library method (12Turk B.E. Huang L.L. Piro E.T. Cantley L.C. Nature Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Data are shown in Fig. 1. The residues preferred at each site from P4–P4′ are summarized in Table I. The strongest selectivity was seen at the P1′ site where large hydrophobic residues were preferred. Small residues, alanine and serine, were preferred at the P3′ site. Although P2′ and P4′ displayed indistinct specificity compared with the P1′ site, a lack of a preference for a basic residue (Arg or Lys) at the P2′ site was unique to MMP-26 (Table I). Among the unprimed positions, the P3 site showed the highest selectivity preferring proline and valine. The P1 site was not as selective as the P3 site, although small residues such as serine were preferred. The preference of MMP-26 for proline at P3, hydrophobic residues at P2 and P1′ sites, and serine at P1 is similar to that of other MMPs (5Netzel-Arnett S. Sang Q.-X. Moore W.G. Narve M.

Among the four inhibitors tested, inhibitor I (23Galardy R.E. Cassabonne M.E. Giese C. Gilbert J.H. Lapierre F. Lopez H. Schaefer M.E. Stack R. Sullivan M. Summers B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 732: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was the most potent for MMP-26 with aK iapp of 0.36 nm. Inhibitor II inhibited MMP-26 with a K iapp of 1.5 nm, which is similar to the inhibition constant with neutrophil collagenase MMP-8 (4 nm) (24Matter H. Schwab W. Barber D. Billen G. Haase B.

Inhibitor III is a less potent stereoisomer of inhibitor II, and MMP-8 discriminates between the two with a 250-fold difference in their inhibition constants (1000 versus 4 nm). There was a 40-fold difference between the K iapp values of the pair of stereoisomers with MMP-26 (60 versus 1.5 nm). Inhibitor IV inhibited MMP-26 with aK iapp of 2.9 μm and an IC50 value of 3.4 μm. This IC50value is similar to the IC50 values with interstitial collagenases MMP-1 and MMP-8 (both are 1 μm) (25Odake S. Morita Y. Morikawa T. Yoshida N. Hori H. Nagai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1994; 199: 1442-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Dialysis of the folded pro-form of MMP-26 results in an increase in activity because of autolysis of the prodomain. MMP-26 was collected after two 24-h dialyses with fresh buffer at 4 °C (further dialysis or incubation gradually reduced the activity). Partially activated MMP-26 was compared with the zymogen form on a silver-stained polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 3). The band near 30 kDa was confirmed to be pro-MMP-26 by amino-terminal sequencing (Fig. 3, lane 2) (14Park H.I., Ni, J. Gerkema F.E. Liu D. Belozerov V.E. Sang Q.-X.A. J. Biol.

Several bands below 30 kDa appeared after the dialysis, three of which were located between 20 and 25 kDa (Fig. 3, lane 3). One or more of the three cleavage products may be active forms of MMP-26 and was analyzed by amino-terminal sequencing. Only the top two bands were successfully sequenced. The top band resulted from cleavage of a peptide bond between Leu49and Thr50, and the band below it was a product of cleavage between Ala75 and Leu76 (sequence based on Ref.14Park H.I., Ni, J.

The cleavage at either site does not remove the cysteine switch sequence PHC82GVPDGSD. Initial screening of a number of fluorogenic peptide substrates revealed that gelatinase and collagenase peptide substrates were most efficiently cleaved by MMP-26 (14Park H.I., Ni, J. Gerkema F.E.

The active MMP-26 concentration was determined by active site titration with inhibitor I (Fig. 4) using the least efficient substrate tested as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The titration analysis revealed the concentration of active MMP-26 to be ∼5% of the total enzyme concentration (21 of 400 nm). The cleavage sites of the six fluorogenic peptide substrates were determined by identifying the mass of the products by mass spectrometry. Mass spectra of the cleavage products revealed that the cleavage sites of the substrates by MMP-26 and MMP-9 were identical as shown in the example of peptide III (Fig.5). The specificity constants (k cat/K m) of these six peptide substrates with MMP-26 were measured and calculated as shown in Table II. MMP-26 hydrolyzed peptide V with the highest specificity constant (3.0 × 104m−1 s−1), which is still 10-fold lower than the specificity constant with MMP-2 (3.97 × 105m−1 s−1) (26Murphy G. Nguyen Q.

We demonstrate that PS1-ΔE9 cells have an enhanced basal PI hydrolysis and [Ca2+]i as compared with both wild type PS1 (PS1-WT) and nontransfected (NT) cells. Both were reversed by the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor neomycin. The PS1-ΔE9-related high basal [Ca2+]i was also reversed by xestospongin C confirming that this effect was inositol trisphosphate receptor-mediated. Carbachol gave a greater stimulation of [Ca2+]i in PS1-ΔE9 cells that took longer to return to basal as compared with responses seen in NT and PS1-WT cells. This long tail-off effect seen in PS1-ΔE9 cells after carbachol stimulation was reversed by xestospongin C and dantrolene, suggesting that it was mediated by inositol trisphosphate receptor and ryanodine receptor amplification of Ca2+. Ruthenium red only reduced carbachol peak elevations of [Ca2+]i in NT and PS1-WT cells and not in PS1-ΔE9 cells. No significant between cell type differences were seen for basal and carbachol-stimulated [Ca2+]i with either ryanodine or the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid. Immunostaining experiments revealed that for all the cell types PS1 is present at the plasma membrane and co-localizes with N-cadherin, a component of the cell-cell adhesion complex. Immunoblotting of cell extracts for PLC-β1 showed that, compared with NT and PS1-WT cells, the PS1-ΔE9 transfectants gave a relative increase in levels of the calpain generated N-terminal fragment (100 kDa) over full-length (150 kDa) PLC-β1. Our results suggest that the PS1-ΔE9 mutation causes upstream changes in PI signaling with enhanced basal PLC activity as a primary effect that leads to a higher [Ca2+]i. This may provide a novel mechanism by which the PS1-ΔE9 mutation sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli and enhanced amyloid β generation.

A second mechanism proposes that PS1 mutations make cells more vulnerable to undergo death by apoptosis. Guo et al. (9Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K. Pham D.G. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the PS1-L286V mutation increases the vulnerability of PC12 cells to apoptosis induced by Aβ (9Guo Q. Sopher B.L. Furukawa K.

Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic effects of PS1 have been shown to involve increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and peroxide levels under conditions of oxidative and excitotoxic stress (9Guo Q.

Hippocampal neurons from L286V PS1 mutant knock-in mice are more vulnerable to excitotoxicity associated with increased [Ca2+]i levels (10Guo Q., Fu, W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These data are in accordance with older reports showing that bradykinin-stimulated fibroblasts from FAD patients have higher [Ca2+]i than fibroblasts from age-matched controls (11Ito E. Oka K. Etcheberrigaray R. Nelson T.J. McPhie D.L. Tofel-Grehl B. Gibson G.E. Alkon D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 12Peterson C. Ratan R.R.

Dysregulation of [Ca2+]i may be of importance in the pathogenesis of AD, because it has also been shown to contribute to enhanced Aβ generation (13Querfurth H.W. Jiang J. Geiger J.D. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 1580-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and tau protein hyperphosphorylation (14Mattson M.P. Engle M.G. Rychlik B. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1991; 15: 117-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A large proportion of Ca2+ mobilization and regulation in neurons can be attributable to cholinergic neurotransmission (15Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Activation of phospholipase C (PLC) results in hydrolysis of phosphoinositides (PI) to give formation of the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol. Although IP3 releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores, diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C (for review, see Ref. 16Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Cholinergic stimulation of PI hydrolysis has been shown to be severely impaired in brain tissue from AD subjects (for review, see Ref. 17Jope R.S. Song L. Powers R.E. Neurobiol. Aging. 1997; 18: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, two molecules that play an essential role in AD, namely Aβ and apolipoprotein E4, have both been shown to disrupt acetylcholine muscarinic receptor stimulated PI hydrolysis in vitro (18Kelly J.F. Furukawa K. Barger S.W. Rengen M.R. Mark R.J. Blanc E.M. Roth G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6753-6758Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 19Cedazo-Minguez A. Cowburn R.F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recent studies from Leissring and colleagues (20Leissring M.A. Paul B.A. Parker I. Cotman C.W. LaFerla F.M. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) have provided some insight into the mechanisms by which PS1 mutations affect Ca2+ signaling. Using Xenopus oocytes loaded with caged IP3, they demonstrated that PS1 modulates the IP3-mediated Ca2+ release from internal stores and that this was enhanced in cells expressing the PS1 M146V mutation (20Leissring M.A. Paul B.A. Parker I. Cotman C.W. LaFerla F.M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 21Leissring M.A. Akbari Y. Fanger C.M. Cahalan M.D. Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). PS1 effects on Ca2+ signaling were suggested to be caused by an abnormal elevation of Ca2+ within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) rather than by perturbations in either the number or activity of IP3-activated Ca2+release channels (22Leissring M.A. LaFerla F.M. Callamaras N. Parker I. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). At present, the effects of PS1 mutations on cholinergic signaling processes upstream of the IP3receptor have not been determined. A previous report by Moerman and Barger (23Moerman A.M. Barger S.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 157: 962-967Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) showed that the PS1-L286V mutation dampened glutamate-induced Ca2+ responses mediated by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors in human NT2 neuroblastoma cells. This study suggested that PS1 mutations may alter upstream neurotransmission processes with resultant consequences for survival at the cellular level and for cognition at the physiological level. To test the hypothesis that FAD-linked PS1 mutations influence muscarinic receptor-stimulated signaling, we used SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with either wild type PS1 (PS1-WT) or the FAD causing exon 9 deletion mutation of PS1 (PS1-ΔE9) to compare basal and carbachol-stimulated PI hydrolysis and [Ca2+]i. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells have been extensively used as a neuronal model to study PI hydrolysis (for review, see Ref. 24Fisher S.K. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 288: 231-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We also examined downstream effects of the PS1-ΔE9 mutation on Ca2+ release from the ER through IP3 receptors (IP3R), ryanodine receptors (RyR), and Ca2+-transporting ATPases under basal conditions and following acetylcholine muscarinic receptor stimulation. Chemicals and isotopes were purchased from the following companies: myo-[2-3H]inositol (10 Ci/mmol) from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol), Dowex 1X8–200 (chloride form), ruthenium red, ryanodine, dantrolene, cyclopiazonic acid, and probenecid were from Sigma. Neomycin (neomycin sulfate) and xestospongin C were fromCalbiochem-Novabiochem (Darmstadt, Germany). Fluo-3 acetoxymethyl (AM) ester and Pluronic F-127 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Europe BV, Leiden, The Netherlands). All other chemicals were standard laboratory reagents. Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with either PS1-WT or the PS1-ΔE9 mutation were established in our laboratory as described previously (25Tanii H. Ankarcrona M. Flood F. Nilsberth C. Mehta N.D. Perez-Tur J. Winblad B. Benedikz E. Cowburn R.F. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in minimum essential medium (MEM) with Earle's salts containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfected cells were additionally supplemented with 200 μg/ml Geneticin. All cell culture supplies were purchased from Invitrogen (European Division). The expression of PS1 in nontransfected (NT) and transfected cell lines was checked by Western blotting as previously described (25Tanii H. Ankarcrona M. Flood F. Nilsberth C. Mehta N.D. Perez-Tur J. Winblad B. Benedikz E. Cowburn R.F. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To obtain cell extracts, cells were washed twice with ice-cold Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested with a cell-scraper, and collected by 3000 rpm centrifugation for 3 min. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2% Nonidet P-40, 2% Triton X-100, and 400 μg/ml protease inhibitors CompleteTM mini, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and centrifuged at 11,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Samples were stored at −20 °C until use. Protein amounts in cell extracts were quantified by the protein assay kit (Pierce). Equivalent amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE using 10 or 7% acrylamide gels for the PS1 or PLC expression analyses, respectively. Proteins were transferred onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences UK) by trans-blot electrophoretic transfer for 4 h at a constant current of 200 mA. After blocking for 1 h using 5% (w/v) dried milk in Tris-buffered solution containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated overnight with the first antibody at the following concentrations; 1:2000 (PS1 antibody), 1:1000 (PLC-β1 and PLC-γ antibodies; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). The membranes were washed in Tris-buffered solution containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 15 min and then three times for 5 min. The secondary antibody (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked) (Amersham Biosciences UK) diluted in blocking solution (1:2000) was added to the membranes for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed as described above, plus an additional wash of 1 h. Bound antibody was detected by the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences UK) after exposure to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences UK). The relative density of immunoreactive bands on Western blots was calculated from the optical density multiplied by the area of the selected band, following acquisition of the blot image through Image Master (AmershamBiosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Cells were cultured until 75–80% confluence in 75-cm2 flasks. One day prior to the experiment, cells were changed to serum-free media containing 5 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol and incubated for 24 h. PI hydrolysis was measured as described previously (19Cedazo-Minguez A. Cowburn R.F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman in 4 ml of PBS. Contents were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 15 min. Pellets were washed twice with 37 °C PBS and re-suspended in 3 ml of 37 °C Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer containing 10 mm LiCl (KHB/Li), gassed with 5% CO2, 95% O2 and centrifuged again (15,000 rpm, 15 min). Cell pellets were re-suspended in 210 μl of KHB/Li, regassed, and 50 μl added to glass centrifuge tubes containing 250 μl KHB/Li buffer with or without 100 μm carbachol. The tubes were incubated at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% O2 with gentle agitation for 25 min. Incubations were stopped by adding 940 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:2). Tubes were incubated on ice for 30 min and phases separated by adding 310 μl of chloroform and 310 μl of water followed by vortexing and centrifugation. 750 μl of the aqueous phase were removed and labeled inositol phosphates (IPs) separated frommyo-[3H]inositol by Dowex chromatography, as described by Berridge (26Berridge M.J. Cell Calcium. 1982; 3: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The chloroform phase was extracted with 75 μl of HCl, and tubes were vortexed again for 20 s, followed by 5 min of centrifugation. The chloroform phase was removed, placed into scintillation vials, and allowed to evaporate before determination of “lipid dpm” by scintillation spectroscopy. Results were expressed as dpm IPs/(dpm IPs + dpm lipid). This unit is independent of the number of cells aliquoted in each tube and upon the degree of labeling of inositol phospholipids (27Fowler C.J Court J.A Tiger G. Bjorklund P.E. Candy J.M. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1987; 60: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For the treatments with neomycin, 1 day prior to the experiment, cells were changed to serum-free medium containing 5 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol, and incubated for 21 h. The medium was then replaced with that containing neomycin (500 μm) plus 5 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol for 3 h prior to PI hydrolysis measures. Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were essentially determined as previously described (28Popescu B.O. Cedazo-Minguez A. Popescu L.M. Winblad B. Cowburn R.F. Ankarcrona M. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were loaded with medium containing 5 μm Fluo-3 AM ester, 0.5% (v/v) Pluronic F-127, and 1 mm organic anion transport inhibitor probenecid (90 min in the dark, at room temperature). After loading, cells were incubated for 120 min in MEM without phenol red with 1 mm probenecid in the dark, at room temperature, to allow intracellular esterases to decompose the Fluo-3 AM ester. For the measurements of basal [Ca2+]i, the medium was removed and Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS added. Basal [Ca2+]i was measured repeatedly during 10 min at 37 °C to certify that a steady state of [Ca2+]i was obtained. Preliminary experiments showed that, for all three cell types, basal [Ca2+]i in the absence of treatments was steady during the entire incubation time courses used (data not shown). Neomycin, ruthenium red, ryanodine, and cyclopiazonic acid were added in PBS at indicated concentrations at 37 °C for the 10 min when basal [Ca2+]i was measured. Xestospongin C and dantrolene were added at indicated concentrations in MEM without phenol red during the 120 min of incubation time and in PBS for the 10 min when basal [Ca2+]i was measured. The PBS was then removed and 100 μm carbachol in PBS solution at 37 °C added (100 μl to each well). Carbachol was present for all subsequent [Ca2+]i measures. Fluorescence was measured by a CytoFluor Series 4000 multiwell plate reader (PerSeptive Biosystems GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany), the excitation and emission wavelengths being 485 and 530 nm, respectively. Slit widths were 20 nm for both excitation and emission. Apparent [Ca2+]i corresponding to fluorescent value F was calculated with the formula: [Ca2+]i =K d(F −F min)/(F max −F), where K d for Fluo-3-Ca2+was taken as 390 nm, as indicated by the protocol from the manufacturer (Molecular Probes Europe BV). F min was determined by measuring the signal of the unloaded cells, andF max was determined by addition to the cells of a 100 mm CaCl2 buffer containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed at 4 °C in 2% paraformaldehyde + 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 20 min and subsequently rinsed in PBS (three 10-min rinses). Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and then 10% goat serum was added for 30 min to block unspecific binding of antibodies. Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies diluted in 10% serum. Polyclonal anti-PS1 N-terminal antibody was diluted 1:500, and monoclonal anti-α-N-cadherin antibody was diluted 1:500. Next day cells were rinsed in PBS (three 10-min rinses) before incubation with anti-mouse antibody conjugated to Alexa Green (1:400 dilution) and anti-rabbit antibody conjugated to cy3 (1:1000 dilution) in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h in the dark. Finally cells were rinsed in PBS (three 10-min rinses) and mounted in glycerol:PBS (1:1) on glass slides. Fluorescence images were excited using the 488-nm line of a krypton laser and the 543-nm line of a helium-neon laser on a Bio-Rad Radiance Plus confocal microscope. Cy3 fluorescence was collected using a HQ 590/70 emission filter (red), and Alexa Green was collected with a HQ 515/30 emission filter (green). Analyses of differences were carried out by ANOVA followed by Fisher's protected least significant distance post hoc test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably transfected to express moderate levels of PS1-WT and PS1-ΔE9 were established previously in our laboratory (25Tanii H. Ankarcrona M. Flood F. Nilsberth C. Mehta N.D. Perez-Tur J. Winblad B. Benedikz E. Cowburn R.F. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The expression of PS1 in these cell lines was confirmed by sequencing and checked by immunoblotting using a PS1 N-terminal antiserum. The pattern of PS1 expression was similar to that reported previously (25Tanii H. Ankarcrona M. Flood F. Nilsberth C. Mehta N.D. Perez-Tur J. Winblad B. Benedikz E. Cowburn R.F. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). NT cells were found to express very low levels of PS1 holoprotein, most of PS1 being identified as ∼28-kDa band corresponding to endogenous PS1 N-terminal fragment (NTF). PS1-WT cells (clones 1-1 and 1-14) showed accumulation of full-length PS1 (48 kDa) as well as of NTF. PS1-ΔE9 cells (clones 1-2 and 2-4) lack the cleavage site where the physiological proteolytic cleavage occurs (site between residues 291 and 299), and showed accumulation of a truncated full-length protein and a reduced endogenous NTF consistent with the deletion of the cleavage region (Fig. 1). Both WT and mutant clones showed similar PS1 mRNA levels following transfection (25Tanii H. Ankarcrona M. Flood F. Nilsberth C. Mehta N.D. Perez-Tur J. Winblad B. Benedikz E. Cowburn R.F. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 593-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The 1-2 clone of PS1-ΔE9 cells shows the highest levels of truncated holoprotein and lower levels of endogenous NTF indicative of higher expression, as compared with the 2-4 clone. Fig. 2 Ashows that basal PI hydrolysis was significantly higher in both clones of PS1-ΔE9 cells (1-2 and 2-4) as compared with NT and to both clones of PS1-WT cells (1-1 and 1-14). Carbachol (100 μm)-stimulated PI hydrolysis was significantly higher in both clones of PS1-ΔE9 cells as compared with both clones of PS1-WT cells (Fig. 2 A). The clone 2-4 of PS1-ΔE9 cells also showed a significantly higher carbachol-stimulated PI hydrolysis as compared with NT cells. However, analysis of the carbachol-stimulated PI hydrolysis as the difference from basal did not show significant differences between any of the three cell types (Fig. 2 B). Basal [Ca2+]i (values given for time 0 before addition of carbachol) was similar in NT (36.2 ± 1.3 nm) and in PS1-WT cells (36.1 ± 0.9 and 38.6 ± 1.2 nm, respectively, for clones 1-1 and 1-14). The PS1-ΔE9-transfected cells showed significantly higher basal [Ca2+]i (58.6 ± 3.2 and 65.1 ± 3.2 nm, respectively, for clones 1-2 and 2-4) as compared with both NT and both clones of PS1-WT cells (p < 0.001; ANOVA, Fisher's post hoc test) (Fig. 3). Treatment of cells with 100 μm carbachol gave a rapid peak elevation of [Ca2+]i. Peak elevations were found at ∼30 s after addition of carbachol. No significant differences were found for peak [Ca2+]i elevations between PS1-WT (64.0 ± 3.6 and 73.0 ± 2.33 nm, respectively, for clones 1-1 and 1-14) and NT cells (65.1 ± 3.3 nm). The PS1-ΔE9 clones showed a carbachol-induced peak [Ca2+]i elevation of 105.4 ± 3.9 nm (clone 1-2) and 133.6 ± 12.4 nm(clone 2-4). These values were statistically significantly higher than those seen for both NT and both clones of PS1-WT cells (p < 0.001; ANOVA, Fisher's post hoctest). [Ca2+]i returned to basal after ∼120 s in NT and PS1-WT cells. In contrast, the PS1-ΔE9 cells showed a long tail-off effect, where [Ca2+]i was still significantly higher than basal even at 5 min after addition of carbachol (p < 0.01; ANOVA, Fisher's post hoc test) (Fig. 3). For subsequent experiments of PI hydrolysis and [Ca2+]i measurements, we selected the 1-1 clone of PS1-WT and the 1-2 clone of PS1-ΔE9. The 1-2 clone of PS1-ΔE9 gave lower basal and carbachol-stimulated PI and [Ca2+] responses as compared with the 2-4 clone and was chosen so as to avoid potential ceiling effects. An enhanced high basal PI hydrolysis could lead to a rise in [Ca2+]i. Alternatively, high [Ca2+]i could activate various PLC isoforms, thereby resulting in an enhanced PI hydrolysis. To investigate the relationship between PLC activity and [Ca2+]i, we treated cells with neomycin, an inhibitor of PLC (29Schacht J. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 1976; 59: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and then determined both basal and carbachol-stimulated PI hydrolysis and [Ca2+]i. Pretreatment for 3 h with neomycin (500 μm) gave drastic reductions of both basal and carbachol-stimulated PI hydrolysis in all cell lines. Neomycin (500 μm) decreased the high basal and carbachol-stimulated PI hydrolysis seen in PS1-ΔE9 cells to the same level as for PS1-WT and NT cells (Fig.4 A). Neomycin (100 and 500 μm) treatment for 10 min before carbachol stimulation did not affect basal [Ca2+]i in either NT or PS1-WT cells. In contrast, both neomycin concentrations significantly reduced basal [Ca2+]i in PS1-ΔE9 cells (to 43.9 ± 1.0 and 39.8 ± 1.3 nm, for 100 and 500 μm neomycin, respectively) (Fig. 4 B). Neomycin (500 μm) completely reversed the significantly higher basal [Ca2+]i in PS1-ΔE9 cells to levels comparable with those seen in NT and PS1-WT cells (Fig.4 B). Neomycin treatment also significantly reduced the carbachol elevation of [Ca2+]i in all cell lines (to 55.4 ± 4.9, 52.0 ± 5.9, and 84.7 ± 6.2 nmin NT, PS1-WT, and PS1-ΔE9 cells, respectively, for 100 μm neomycin and to 52.7 ± 4.1, 46.9 ± 5.0, and 71.1 ± 4.2 nm in NT, PS1-WT, and PS1-ΔE9 cells, respectively, for 500 μm neomycin). The neomycin (both 100 and 500 μm) reduction of carbachol-stimulated [Ca2+]i seen in PS1-ΔE9 cells did not come down to the same level as seen for either NT (p < 0.05; ANOVA, Fisher's post hoc test) or PS1-WT cells (p < 0.01; ANOVA, Fisher's post hoc test) (Fig. 4 B). Xestospongin C, a specific antagonist of IP3R (30Gafni J. Munsch J.A. Lam T.H. Catlin M.C. Costa L.G. Molinski T.F. Pessah I.N. Neuron. 1997; 19: 723-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), did not induce significant changes of basal [Ca2+]i in either NT or PS1-WT cells. In contrast, for PS1-ΔE9 cells xestospongin C gave a significant reduction of basal [Ca2+]i to the levels seen in NT and PS1-WT cells (to 49.0 ± 1.5 and 44.2 ± 1.2 nm for 1 and 10 μm, respectively) (Fig.5). Xestospongin C (10 μm) significantly reduced the carbachol elevation of [Ca2+]i in NT and PS1-WT cells to levels approaching basal [Ca2+]i(to 44.1 ± 3.5 nm in NT and to 50.5 ± 3.0 nm in PS1-WT cells). In PS1-ΔE9 cells, xestospongin C gave a dose-dependent reduction of the carbachol elevation of [Ca2+]i (to 67.1 ± 5.3 and to 53.3 ± 3.7 nm, respectively, for 1 and 10 μm xestospongin C). These reduced levels were similar to those seen in NT and PS1-WT cells (Fig. 5). Both 1 and 10 μm"
https://openalex.org/W2000315199,"A variety of models have recently emerged to explain how the molecular motor kinesin is able to maintain processive movement for over 100 steps. Although these models differ in significant features, they all predict that kinesin's catalytic domains intermittently separate from each other as the motor takes 8-nm steps along the microtubule. Furthermore, at some point in this process, one molecule of ATP is hydrolyzed per step. However, exactly when hydrolysis and product release occur in relation to this forward step have not been established. Furthermore, the rate at which this separation occurs as well as the speed of motor stepping onto and release from the microtubule have not been measured. In the absence of this information, it is difficult to critically evaluate competing models of kinesin function. We have addressed this issue by developing spectroscopic probes whose fluorescence is sensitive to motor-motor separation or microtubule binding. The kinetics of these fluorescence changes allow us to directly measure how fast kinesin steps onto and releases from the microtubule and provide insight into how processive movement is maintained by this motor.

These include its high duty ratio and ability to hydrolyze multiple ATP molecules per force productive encounter-features that enhance the probability that a motor will remain attached even under load (1Hancock W.O. Howard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13147-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 2Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol.

However, processive movement also requires two heads, and coordination between these two motor domains is essential if kinesin is to move in an orderly fashion along its track (7Crevel I. Carter N. Schliwa M. Cross R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5863-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Young E.C. Mahtani H.K. Gelles J. Biochem. 1998; 37: 3467-3479Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two models have recently appeared to explain how the motor domains work together to bring about processive movement. In the hand-over-hand model (1Hancock W.O. Howard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13147-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 9Vugmeyster Y. Berliner E. Gelles J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 747-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), each head alternates between a forward and rearward orientation on the microtubule, whereas in the inchworm model (10Hua W. Chung J. Gelles J. Science. 2002; 295: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the forward and rearward heads retain their relative positions throughout the mechanochemical cycle. The hand-over-hand model proposes that ATP binding docks the neck linker of the attached head, and this swings the tethered head forward toward the next microtubule β subunit 8 nm away (11Coy D.L. Wagenbach M. Howard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 276: 3667-3671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 12Schief W.R. Howard J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis on the rear head and ADP dissociation from the newly attached forward head follow, and they lead to dissociation of the rearward head from the microtubule. The net effect is hydrolysis of one ATP molecule per 8-nm step in the plus end direction (11Coy D.L. Wagenbach M. Howard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 276: 3667-3671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 13Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the inchworm model, ATP binding, hydrolysis, and dissociation of ADP are associated with alternating separation and association of the two heads, only one of which is enzymatically active. However, precisely where nucleotide binding and hydrolysis fit into the overall scheme has not been determined (10Hua W. Chung J. Gelles J. Science. 2002; 295: 844-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Despite their differences, both models agree on several key features. First, ATP induces the two heads to separate by 8 nm, as one of them steps forward in the “+” direction. Second, at some point in the cycle, ATP is hydrolyzed, and phosphate is released. Third, ATP binding and hydrolysis changes the affinity of one of the kinesin motor domains for the microtubule, from “strong binding” to “weak binding,” and this strong to weak transition is associated with forward movement. Finally, the cycle is completed when the trailing head dissociates from the microtubule and rejoins its partner. However, several key questions remain unanswered by these models. What is the nature of the conformational change that produces the forward step? What enzymatic process actually produces this 8 nm separation, ATP binding or ATP hydrolysis? When and how quickly does the trailing head dissociate from the microtubule? How is the mechanical strain that is placed on the neck linkers by attachment of both heads relieved? Determining the speed and timing of kinesin's forward step and trailing head release are therefore crucial in evaluating each of the competing models and may help in their refinement as well as in the testing of their validity. In our previous study (14Rosenfeld S.S. Jefferson G.M. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40167-40174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that a fluorescent probe located on the neck linker of a kinesin monomeric construct could be used to measure in real time the reorientation and docking of the neck linker and to identify the step in the enzymatic cycle when this occurs. In this study, we have extended this approach to a dimeric kinesin construct to measure the kinetics of neck linker-neck linker and neck linker-microtubule separation. These measurements provide constraints that should allow us to critically examine current models of kinesin processivity. Fluorescent probes were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Synthesis of mant nucleotides was carried out as described (15Hiratsuka T. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Our goal was to generate a kinesin construct of 413 residues that contained one reactive cysteine at position 333 and in which tryptophan 340 was mutated to phenylalanine. Using a plasmid encoding wild type human K413 (16Rosenfeld S.S. Correia J.J. Xing J. Rener B. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30212-30222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the following PCR primers were used to amplify the native sequence: upstream primer, 5′-AAGTTGCATGTGTCTAGATATACATATGGCGGACCTGGCC-3′; downstream primer, 5′-AAGTTGCATGTGCTCGAGTAAAAAATTTCCTATAACTCCAAT-3′. The PCR product was digested with PstI and XhoI to generate a fragment, which was ligated into pBSK, and the resulting product was linearized with PstI and XbaI. A PCR fragment encoding the N-terminal 349 residues of a cysteine-light mutant of kinesin (kindly provided by Dr. Ron Vale, UCSF) was amplified with the upstream primer described above and with the following downstream primer, 5′-GCATGTGCTCGAGTTCTTTTTCTTTTTCATACTTCTTTTTGAACTGTTCTGCAGTTAAC-3′. The PCR product was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated into the linearized pBSK plasmid described above to generate the CLM1-(1–413) construct, the cysteine-light mutant of K413. The following primers were then used to PCR-amplify the C-terminal 78 residues from CLM-(1–413): upstream primer, 5′-AGGAGTTAACTGCAGAACAGTTCAAAAAGAAGTATGAAAAAG-3′; downstream primer, 5′-AAGTTGCATGTGCTCGAGTTAAAAATTTCCTATAACTCCAAT-3′. The PCR product and CLM-(1–413) were digested with PstI andXhoI followed by ligation of the PCR product into CLM-(1–413). The mutated kinesin sequence was then excised with Nde and XhoI and ligated into pET21A for protein expression. K413W340F was labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS or tetramethyl rhodamine 5-maleimide (TMR) by incubation of a 10-fold molar excess of label over active sites in 100 mmKCl, 25 mm Hepes, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm Tris(carboxyethyl) phosphine, and 100 μm ATP, pH 7.5 for 3 h at room temperature. Excess label was removed by gel filtration or dialysis through Centriprep 10 concentrators (Amicon). Stoichiometry of labeling was 0.85–0.95 mol/mol of active site for both probes. Lifetime and anisotropy decay measurements were made with a pulsed fluorimeter as previously described (39Xing J. Wriggers W. Jefferson G.M. Stein R. Cheung H.C. Rosenfeld S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35413-35423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Transient kinetic measurements were made in an Applied Photophysics SX.18 MV stopped flow spectrometer with instrument dead time of 1.2 ms. Complexes of kinesin and microtubules were formed with a 5–10-fold molar excess of microtubules over active sites. ADP was added to 3 μm to ensure that the tethered kinesin head of a kinesin·microtubule complex contained ADP in the active site. Dansyl fluorescence was generated by exciting at 295 nm (for tryptophan energy transfer), and the emission was monitored through a 500-nm broad bandpass filter with a transmission half-width of 20 nm (Omega Optical). Rhodamine fluorescence was monitored by exciting at 520 nm and monitoring emission through a 590-nm cutoff filter. Fluorescence of mant ATP was monitored by exciting at 278 nm. At this wavelength, the mant fluorophor is excited by fluorescence energy transfer from vicinal tyrosine residues of kinesin (17Cheng J-Q Jiang W. Hackney D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5288-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have found that for dimeric kinesin constructs, the mant fluorescence emission at this exciting wavelength is not affected by the presence of microtubules (data not shown). The neck linker of kinesin is a region in the C terminus of the motor domain that plays a key role in mechanochemical transduction by this motor (3Vale R.D. Milligan R.A.

Our intent was to attach fluorescent probes via a cysteine residue at position 333, within the neck linker sequence. In order to do this we engineered a kinesin dimer devoid of reactive cysteines and with a cysteine mutation at position 333. Furthermore, since we intended to perform FRET studies between microtubule tryptophans and an AEDANS probe at position 333 of kinesin, we mutated tryptophan 340 to phenylalanine. The kinesin mutant thus generated, referred to as K413W340F, demonstrated no energy transfer between the remaining tryptophan residues at positions 360 and 368 and an AEDANS probe at position 333. This is to be expected, given the 35–40 Å distance separating these residues (20Kozielski F. Sack S. Marx A. Thormahlen M. Schonbrunn E. Biou V. Thompson A. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E.

Fig.1 depicts the wild type kinesin dimeric structure derived from Rattus norvegicus (20Kozielski F. Sack S. Marx A. Thormahlen M. Schonbrunn E. Biou V. Thompson A. Mandelkow E.-M. Mandelkow E.

In this figure, structures relevant to our study are depicted in the space-filling format, including the bound nucleotide (magenta), the neck linker (yellow), and leucine 335 (in red and equivalent to valine 333 in the human sequence). K413W340F has a microtubule-activated ATPase activity, which at 10 mm KCl has values of 19.0 ± 1.9 s−1 and 0.25 ± 0.10 μm for k cat andK 0.5,MT, respectively. Labeling cysteine 333 with either 1,5-IAEDANS or TMR did not appreciably alter these values (data not shown). Although the value of k cat is quite close to values reported for similar Drosophilaconstructs, the ratio ofk cat/K 0.5,MT (referred to as k bi(ATPase)) is ∼4-fold smaller (4Jiang W Stock M.F., Li, X. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 800-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We measured the kinetics of the weak-to-strong transition in this construct by mixing in the stopped flow a complex of 2′-deoxy mant-ADP·K413W340F with microtubules and 1 mm ATP and monitoring nucleotide release (2Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 22Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 724-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The resulting fluorescence decay demonstrated a linear dependence on microtubule concentration, defining an apparent second order rate constant,k bi(ADP) of 1.04 ± 0.07 μm−1 s−1 (data not shown). The ratiok bi(ATPase)/k bi(ADP) is a measure of the number of ATP molecules hydrolyzed per processive run. Its value is 76, which compares to the previously reported value of ∼100 for native kinesin constructs of comparable size (4Jiang W Stock M.F., Li, X. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7626-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, although our mutagenesis of K413W340F did alter the affinity of a kinesin·ADP state for microtubules (23Rosenfeld S.S. Correia J.J. Mayo M.S. Rener B. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9473-9482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it did not appear to have appreciably affected its processivity. We first sought to label the K413W340F dimer at position 333 with an optical probe whose fluorescence would be sensitive to the distance between the two neck linkers of the motor. Previous reports had demonstrated that the fluorescent probe TMR dimerizes under favorable conditions (24Packard B.Z. Toptygin D.D. Komoriya A. Brand L Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11640-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Hamman B.D. Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G. Bochkariov D.E. Traut R.R. Jameson D.M. J. Biol.

Bioconjugate Chem. 2000; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that labeling dimeric kinesin at position 333 with TMR might produce a motor whose rhodamine probes would alternately dimerize and separate during each mechanochemical cycle, as the motor steps along on the microtubule. Monomeric rhodamine demonstrates a peak in its absorption spectrum at 555 nm, a shoulder at 518 nm, and a 518/555 nm ratio of 0.5 (24Packard B.Z. Toptygin D.D. Komoriya A. Brand L Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11640-11645Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Hamman B.D. Oleinikov A.V. Jokhadze G.G. Bochkariov D.E. Traut R.R. Jameson D.M. J. Biol.

Bioconjugate Chem. 2000; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Dimerization strongly quenches the rhodamine fluorescence emission. It also produces a blue shift in the absorption spectrum, with two discrete peaks at 555 and 518 nm and with an increase in the 518/555 nm ratio to 1.4 (24Packard B.Z. Toptygin D.D. Komoriya A.

Fig. 2 Ashows that the absorption spectrum of TMR-labeled K413W340F (dotted spectrum) has the features characteristic of rhodamine dimer. Addition of guanidine hydrochloride to 6 menhances the 555 nm absorbance and reduces the 518 peak (solid spectrum), as expected since unfolding of K413W340F would separate the rhodamine probes. The fluorescence emission spectrum of TMR-labeled K413W340F (Fig. 2 B, dotted spectrum) is highly quenched, and addition of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride enhances fluorescence over 10-fold (Fig. 2 B, solid spectrum). In the absence of added nucleotide, K413W340F binds to microtubules via one of its two motor domains (29Kawaguchi K. Ishiwata S.-I. Science. 2001; 291: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 33Uemura S. Kawaguchi K. Yajima J. Edamatsu M. Toyoshima Y.Y. Ishiwata S.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The absorption spectrum of a complex of rhodamine K413W340F + microtubules under rigor conditions demonstrated a reduction in the 518/555 nm ratio (1.3 versus1.5 for TMR-labeled K413W340F). This was reduced to 1.2 in the presence of ATP under conditions that support processive movement (10 mm KCl) and is illustrated in Fig. 2 C as the dashed spectrum. In the presence of 1 mm AMPPNP, both heads of kinesin attach strongly to the microtubule (29Kawaguchi K. Ishiwata S.-I. Science. 2001; 291: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This is reflected in Fig. 2 C by a further reduction of the 518/555 nm ratio to 1.1 (solid spectrum). This data suggests that under conditions that favor processive movement, an appreciable fraction of kinesin molecules are attached to the microtubule via both heads. Our spectroscopic results allowed us to make testable predictions about the time-dependent fluorescence emission of rhodamine-labeled K413W340F as it moves along the microtubule. The first of these is illustrated in Fig. 3 A. Kinesin enters its mechanochemical cycle with one head strongly attached to the microtubule. The fluorescence of this species should be relatively quenched. ATP binding to the attached head should swing the tethered head forward to attach to the next microtubule-binding site, pulling the two heads apart by 8 nm. We would therefore predict that mixing a complex of rhodamine-labeled kinesin·microtubules with ATP should produce an initial fluorescence rise, followed by a fall as dissociation of the trailing head allows the neck linkers to spring back together. The red and green transients marked 10 mmKCl and 100 mmKCl in Fig.3 B confirm this, and the inset in the figure demonstrates the rising phase over a shorter time scale. At 100 mm KCl, the fluorescence at the completion of this transient is lower than that at the start. This would be expected, since high ionic strength reduces kinesin's affinity for the microtubule, and dissociation of the trailing head should be followed by dissociation of the motor (2Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 3Vale R.D. Milligan R.A. Science. 2000; 288: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar,30Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). By contrast, at 10 mm KCl, the final fluorescence is ∼50% greater than the starting fluorescence, which implies that during a processive run, the motors partition between singly and doubly attached species. Fig. 3 B also shows that repeating this experiment in the absence of microtubules (blue transient markedno microtubules) produces no change in rhodamine emission. Our second prediction is that the rate of the rising phase should vary hyperbolically with ATP concentration, and should be no faster than the rate of ATP binding. Fig. 4 (open boxes) confirms this and defines a maximum rate of 763 ± 84 s−1 and apparent dissociation constant of 98 ± 24 μm in 100 mm KCl. Similar results were seen at low ionic strength (data not shown). We measured the rate of 2′-deoxy mant-ATP binding to the attached head by monitoring FRET from kinesin tyrosine residues to the mant fluorophor (17Cheng J-Q Jiang W. Hackney D.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5288-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the rate of mant nucleotide binding (closed triangles) was consistently as fast or faster than the rate of the rising phase of the rhodamine transient. It varied linearly with nucleotide concentration, defining an apparent second order rate constant of 4.9 ± 1.1 μm−1 s−1 with an extrapolated dissociation rate constant of 73 ± 24 s−1. This dissociation rate is similar to prior measurements on native kinesin constructs (2Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 717-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Moyer M.L. Gilbert S.P. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 800-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 724-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Once kinesin has stepped forward, its trailing head dissociates from the microtubule. This should allow the neck linkers to spring back together, reform rhodamine dimers, and quench the rhodamine fluorescence. At 100 mm KCl, the rate of this phase should match the rate at which kinesin dissociates from the microtubule, since the microtubule affinity of K413W340F·ADP is reduced, and dissociation is rapid. Our third prediction is that the rate of the decrease in rhodamine fluorescence at high ionic strength should match the rate at which ATP dissociates kinesin from the microtubule. Fig.5 confirms this. The rate of ATP-induced dissociation at 100 mm KCl, as measured by turbidity (closed circles) is close to that of the falling phase of the rhodamine transient at this ionic strength (closed triangles), with an extrapolated maximum rate of ∼50–60 s−1. At 10 mm KCl, the falling phase of the rhodamine transient fit a double exponential decay, and the faster phase constituted 75–80% of the total signal amplitude. This phase showed an ATP concentration dependence essentially identical to that at 100 mm KCl (Fig. 5, open boxes). The slower phase showed little ATP concentration dependence, and its rate ranged between 1.1–2.4 s−1. At this ionic strength, little dissociation could be detected with turbidity over the time course of the rhodamine transient (data not shown). This strongly suggests that the rate of ATP-induced decrease in rhodamine fluorescence is controlled by (and therefore is a measure of) how fast the trailing head can dissociate from the microtubule. Our fourth prediction, illustrated in Fig.6 A, is that mixing rhodamine-labeled K413W340F + microtubules with ADP should produce a small decrease in fluorescence, as the partially separated neck linkers reapproximate with microtubule dissociation. The orange fluorescence transient depicted in Fig. 6 C (ADP) confirms this. A small amplitude, single exponential decay at 1 mmADP and 100 mm KCl (final concentrations) was observed, corresponding to a 4% decrease in fluorescence intensity, with a rate constant of 128 ± 21 s−1 (n = 10). This rate is ∼7–8 fold faster than the corresponding process with native kinesin, and is consistent with the lower affinity of the K413W340F·ADP for the microtubule (31Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13233-13241Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 32Hackney D.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4437-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). AMPPNP binding causes both heads of kinesin to attach to the microtubule (29Kawaguchi K. Ishiwata S.-I. Science. 2001; 291: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 33Uemura S. Kawaguchi K. Yajima J. Edamatsu M. Toyoshima Y.Y. Ishiwata S.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5977-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our fifth prediction, illustrated in Fig.6 B, is that mixing with AMPPNP should produce a fluorescence transient consisting only of a rising phase. Furthermore, the initial fluorescence intensity should be the same as that for mixing with ADP or ATP, because in each case the starting conditions are the same. The red transient marked AMPPNP in Fig. 6 C confirms these predictions. Mixing with 1 mm AMPPNP and 100 mm KCl (final concentrations) produced a biphasic transient with rates of 48 ± 19 s−1 and 1.6 ± 1.1 s−1 (n = 10), and the amplitude of the faster phase constituted 40% of the total amplitude. The rate of the faster phase is similar to the previously reported rate of AMPPNP-accelerated ADP release (13Gilbert S.P. Moyer M.L. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the presence of a second, slower phase suggests that attachment of the second head to the microtubule may occur in two steps. The green transient in Fig.6 C was produced by mixing with 1 mm ATP and 100 mm KCl (final concentrations). Fitting to two exponential terms, as per Fig. 3, reveals that the extrapolated amplitude of the rising phase is 87% of the total signal amplitude for AMPPNP. Several further predictions are also supported by our results. Mixing unlabeled K413W340F + microtubules with ATP produces no signal beyond that of buffer alone (data not shown), which establishes that the signal change seen in Fig. 3 B is not due to light scattering. Furthermore, repeating these experiments with a rhodamine labeled monomeric kinesin (K349) + microtubules produced no fluorescence change (data not shown). Our conclusions from the rhodamine probe would be supported if a different probe, sensitive to neck linker association with the microtubule, could provide a direct measure of the rate of trailing head dissociation that agreed with the rhodamine data. For this purpose, we utilized an AEDANS probe on the kinesin neck linker. In our previous study, we demonstrated that an AEDANS probe attached in the neck linker of a monomeric kinesin construct could be excited by energy transfer from the microtubule tryptophan residues (14Rosenfeld S.S. Jefferson G.M. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40167-40174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and we established that this probe could monitor kinesin-microtubule association. We labeled K413W340F at position 333 on the neck linker with AEDANS, monitored microtubule binding by FRET, and found that binding produced a 21% fluorescence enhancement in the absence of nucleotide (data not shown). In our previous study, we also had shown that binding of ATP to an AEDANS-kinesin·microtubule complex reduced the FRET efficiency of the AEDANS probe (14Rosenfeld S.S. Jefferson G.M. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40167-40174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This, plus the rapid rate at which a doubly attached intermediate would be formed (>750 s−1, Fig. 4), means that mixing with ATP would likely produce a low amplitude rising phase that may not be observable in the stopped flow. This would then be followed by a fluorescence decay as the trailing head releases from the microtubule (Fig. 7 A). Furthermore, at 10 mm KCl, the amplitude of this decay would be expected to be smaller than at 100 mm KCl, sin"

Expression of CEACAM1 in prostate cancer cells suppresses their growth in vivo. However, CEACAM1 has no effect on the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro. This difference suggests that the antitumor effect of CEACAM1 may be due to inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, perhaps by increased secretion of antiangiogenic molecules from the cells.

Lastly, phosphorylation at serine 503 in the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1 was shown to be critical for the tumor-suppressive activity (23Estrera V.T. Chen D.-T. Luo W. Hixson D. Lin S.-H. J. Biol.

Pu, K.-A. Do, W. Luo, C. J. Logothetis, and S.-H. Lin, unpublished data. 2Y. S. Pu, K.-A. Do, W. Luo, C. J. Logothetis, and S.-H. Lin, unpublished data. suggesting that CEACAM1 expression does not directly kill tumor cells in vitro. Thus, how CEACAM1 suppresses tumors in vivo is unknown. Because angiogenesis is essential for the growth and progression of solid tumors (25Folkman J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar), it is possible that the anti-tumor effect of CEACAM1 involves inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we have shown that CEACAM1 expression in prostate cancer cells caused the release of a factor or factors that had a strong antiangiogenic effect in both in vitro and in vivo assays. In addition, we have shown that this antiangiogenic effect was due to induction of endothelial cell apoptosis. We have also found that the ability of various CEACAM1 mutants to induce endothelial cell apoptosis closely paralleled their tumor-suppressive activityin vivo. These observations suggest that the in vivo tumor suppression of CEACAM1 is due, at least in part, to its ability to inhibit tumor angiogenesis.DISCUSSIONAlthough the anti-tumor effect of CEACAM1 in vivo has been extensively documented, how CEACAM1 mediated tumor suppression was not clear. This study reports the antiangiogenic effect of CEACAM1. Several lines of evidence indicate that inhibition of tumor angiogenesis may be involved in CEACAM1-mediated tumor suppression. First, CEACAM1-expressing cells secreted a factor or factors that blocked endothelial cell migration in vitro and corneal angiogenesis in vivo. Second, CM from CEACAM1-expressing DU145 cells specifically inhibited in vitro proliferation of HUVECs and HPAECs but not primary epithelial cells or DU145 prostate cancer cells. Third, CEACAM1 CM inhibited endothelial cell growth by inducing apoptosis. Finally, the induction of endothelial cell apoptosis by CEACAM1 mutants correlated with their ability to suppress tumor growth in vivo.It is likely that expression of CEACAM1 in tumor cells induces the production of an inhibitory factor or factors that affect tumor angiogenesis, leading to suppression of the tumor growth in vivo. Normal growth is a balance between angiogenesis and antiangiogenesis activities in the tissues, and tumorigenesis is the result of an imbalance in the positive and negative regulators of angiogenesis. For example, studies by Bielenberg et al. (30Bielenberg D.R. Bucana C.D. Sanchez R. Mulliken J.B. Folkman J. Fidler I.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 14: 401-408PubMed Google Scholar) showed that proliferating hemangiomas express high levels of bFGF and VEGF but are deficient in IFN-β, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis. Dameron et al. (31Dameron K.M. Volpert O.V. Tainsky M.A. Bouck N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; LIX: 483-489Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) showed that cells cultured from normal tissues secrete higher levels of inhibitors but lower levels of inducers than do cancer cells. Based on these observations, Dameron et al. (31Dameron K.M. Volpert O.V. Tainsky M.A. Bouck N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; LIX: 483-489Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) postulated that normal adult tissues undergo little neovascularization because they often produce angiogenesis inhibitors. In contrast, tumor cells are angiogenic because they secrete angiogenic factors or have decreased levels of angiogenesis inhibitors. When a tumor suppressor is present, cells often secrete angiogenesis inhibitors and have an antiangiogenic phenotype. For instance, p53 stimulates the production of thrombospondin-1 (32Dameron K.M. Volpert O.V. Tainsky M.A. Bouck N. Science. 1994; 265: 1582-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 33Rastinejad F. Polverini P.J. Bouck N.P. Cell. 1989; 56: 345-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), which inhibits neovascularization in vivo and endothelial cell migration in vitro (34Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F., Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Similarly, Nishimori et al. (35Nishimori H. Shiratsuchi T. Urano T. Kimura Y. Kiyono K. Tatsumi K. Yoshida S. Ono M. Kuwano M. Nakamura Y. Tokino T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2145-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) reported that p53 induces the expression of the brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor BAI1, which is absent or significantly reduced in glioblastoma cell lines. Van Meiret al. (36Van Meir E.G. Polverini P.J. Chazin V.R., Su Huang H.-J. de Tribolet N. Cavenee W.K. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) also reported the release of an inhibitor of angiogenesis upon induction of wild-type p53 expression in glioblastoma cells. Therefore, we believe that the antiangiogenic effect of CEACAM1 most likely results from the production of an angiogenesis inhibitor or inhibitors. Using RNase protection and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis, we found that VEGF and bFGF did not participate in the antiangiogenic action of CEACAM1. Also, CEACAM1 CM induced endothelial cell apoptosis, probably by means of an apoptosis-inducing antiangiogenic factor rather than down-regulation of angiogenesis stimulators. Thus, down-regulation of CEACAM1 in several carcinomas may decrease angiogenesis inhibitors, leading to tumor progression.The identity of this inhibitory factor is not known. That the CEACAM1-induced factor inhibited the growth of endothelial cells but not epithelial cells suggests that it is not the apoptosis inducers Fas ligand, tumor necrosis factor, or transforming growth factor-β, which lack target cell specificity. We can also rule out angiopoietin-1, which is chemotactic for endothelial cells but has no proliferative effect on them (37Witzenbichler B. Maisonpierre P.C. Jones P. Yancopoulos G.D. Isner J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18514-18521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and its inhibitor, angiopoietin-2. Consistent with this prediction, we found that angiopoietin-1 expression was not affected by CEACAM1 in an RNase protection assay (data not shown). We also believe the CEACAM1-induced factor is not a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). Tumor-induced angiogenesis begins with dissolution of basement membrane surrounding pre-existing blood vessels, a process aided by MMPs that are produced by tumor cells and supporting cells. Increased MMP activity has been positively linked to increased metastatic and angiogenic potential of tumors (38Pluda J.M. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: 203-218PubMed Google Scholar), and up-regulation of MMP-2, -7, and -9, and stromelysin-3 mRNA has been detected during tumor invasion and metastasis (39Polette M. Clavel C. Cockett M. Girod de Bentzmann S. Murphy G. Birembaut P. Invasion Metastasis. 1993; 13: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hahnel E. Harvey J.M. Joyce R. Robbins P.D. Sterrett G.F. Hahnel R. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Two observations suggest that the CEACAM1-induced factor is not related to MMPs or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 or -2. First, CEACAM1 affects early tumor progression; there is no evidence that CEACAM1 affects tumor invasion or metastasis. Second, MMPs and their inhibitors do not cause endothelial cell apoptosis. Rather, they exert their effects indirectly by degradation of basement membrane. Therefore, the CEACAM1-induced factor is probably not an MMP or an MMP inhibitor.Other known angiogenesis inhibitors include angiostatin (41O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A.

Endostatin is a 20-kDa C-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII and specifically inhibits endothelial proliferation and potently inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth (42O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y.

The 16-kDa N-terminal fragment of human prolactin was shown to inhibit VEGF-induced activation of Ras in capillary endothelial cells (46Clapp C. Martial J.A. Guzman R.C. Rentier-Delrue F. Weiner R.I. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1292-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that angiogenic inhibitors can be fragments of proteins whose functions are not related to angiogenesis. It will be interesting to see whether the CEACAM1-induced factor is a fragment of a known protein. In any event, it is very likely that the CEACAM1-induced factor is a previously unknown molecule.

Because angiogenesis is essential for the growth and progression of solid tumors (25Folkman J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 4-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar), it is possible that the anti-tumor effect of CEACAM1 involves inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we have shown that CEACAM1 expression in prostate cancer cells caused the release of a factor or factors that had a strong antiangiogenic effect in both in vitro and in vivo assays. In addition, we have shown that this antiangiogenic effect was due to induction of endothelial cell apoptosis. We have also found that the ability of various CEACAM1 mutants to induce endothelial cell apoptosis closely paralleled their tumor-suppressive activityin vivo. These observations suggest that the in vivo tumor suppression of CEACAM1 is due, at least in part, to its ability to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. DISCUSSIONAlthough the anti-tumor effect of CEACAM1 in vivo has been extensively documented, how CEACAM1 mediated tumor suppression was not clear. This study reports the antiangiogenic effect of CEACAM1. Several lines of evidence indicate that inhibition of tumor angiogenesis may be involved in CEACAM1-mediated tumor suppression. First, CEACAM1-expressing cells secreted a factor or factors that blocked endothelial cell migration in vitro and corneal angiogenesis in vivo. Second, CM from CEACAM1-expressing DU145 cells specifically inhibited in vitro proliferation of HUVECs and HPAECs but not primary epithelial cells or DU145 prostate cancer cells. Third, CEACAM1 CM inhibited endothelial cell growth by inducing apoptosis. Finally, the induction of endothelial cell apoptosis by CEACAM1 mutants correlated with their ability to suppress tumor growth in vivo.It is likely that expression of CEACAM1 in tumor cells induces the production of an inhibitory factor or factors that affect tumor angiogenesis, leading to suppression of the tumor growth in vivo. Normal growth is a balance between angiogenesis and antiangiogenesis activities in the tissues, and tumorigenesis is the result of an imbalance in the positive and negative regulators of angiogenesis. For example, studies by Bielenberg et al. (30Bielenberg D.R. Bucana C.D. Sanchez R. Mulliken J.B. Folkman J. Fidler I.J. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 14: 401-408PubMed Google Scholar) showed that proliferating hemangiomas express high levels of bFGF and VEGF but are deficient in IFN-β, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis. Dameron et al. (31Dameron K.M. Volpert O.V. Tainsky M.A. Bouck N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; LIX: 483-489Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) showed that cells cultured from normal tissues secrete higher levels of inhibitors but lower levels of inducers than do cancer cells. Based on these observations, Dameron et al. (31Dameron K.M. Volpert O.V. Tainsky M.A. Bouck N. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; LIX: 483-489Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) postulated that normal adult tissues undergo little neovascularization because they often produce angiogenesis inhibitors. In contrast, tumor cells are angiogenic because they secrete angiogenic factors or have decreased levels of angiogenesis inhibitors. When a tumor suppressor is present, cells often secrete angiogenesis inhibitors and have an antiangiogenic phenotype. For instance, p53 stimulates the production of thrombospondin-1 (32Dameron K.M. Volpert O.V. Tainsky M.A. Bouck N. Science. 1994; 265: 1582-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 33Rastinejad F. Polverini P.J. Bouck N.P. Cell. 1989; 56: 345-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), which inhibits neovascularization in vivo and endothelial cell migration in vitro (34Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F., Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6624Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Similarly, Nishimori et al. (35Nishimori H. Shiratsuchi T. Urano T. Kimura Y. Kiyono K. Tatsumi K. Yoshida S. Ono M. Kuwano M. Nakamura Y. Tokino T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2145-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) reported that p53 induces the expression of the brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor BAI1, which is absent or significantly reduced in glioblastoma cell lines. Van Meiret al. (36Van Meir E.G. Polverini P.J. Chazin V.R., Su Huang H.-J. de Tribolet N. Cavenee W.K. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) also reported the release of an inhibitor of angiogenesis upon induction of wild-type p53 expression in glioblastoma cells. Therefore, we believe that the antiangiogenic effect of CEACAM1 most likely results from the production of an angiogenesis inhibitor or inhibitors. Using RNase protection and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis, we found that VEGF and bFGF did not participate in the antiangiogenic action of CEACAM1. Also, CEACAM1 CM induced endothelial cell apoptosis, probably by means of an apoptosis-inducing antiangiogenic factor rather than down-regulation of angiogenesis stimulators. Thus, down-regulation of CEACAM1 in several carcinomas may decrease angiogenesis inhibitors, leading to tumor progression.The identity of this inhibitory factor is not known. That the CEACAM1-induced factor inhibited the growth of endothelial cells but not epithelial cells suggests that it is not the apoptosis inducers Fas ligand, tumor necrosis factor, or transforming growth factor-β, which lack target cell specificity. We can also rule out angiopoietin-1, which is chemotactic for endothelial cells but has no proliferative effect on them (37Witzenbichler B. Maisonpierre P.C. Jones P. Yancopoulos G.D. Isner J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18514-18521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), and its inhibitor, angiopoietin-2. Consistent with this prediction, we found that angiopoietin-1 expression was not affected by CEACAM1 in an RNase protection assay (data not shown). We also believe the CEACAM1-induced factor is not a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). Tumor-induced angiogenesis begins with dissolution of basement membrane surrounding pre-existing blood vessels, a process aided by MMPs that are produced by tumor cells and supporting cells. Increased MMP activity has been positively linked to increased metastatic and angiogenic potential of tumors (38Pluda J.M. Semin. Oncol. 1997; 24: 203-218PubMed Google Scholar), and up-regulation of MMP-2, -7, and -9, and stromelysin-3 mRNA has been detected during tumor invasion and metastasis (39Polette M. Clavel C. Cockett M. Girod de Bentzmann S. Murphy G. Birembaut P. Invasion Metastasis. 1993; 13: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hahnel E. Harvey J.M. Joyce R. Robbins P.D. Sterrett G.F. Hahnel R. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 55: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Two observations suggest that the CEACAM1-induced factor is not related to MMPs or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 or -2. First, CEACAM1 affects early tumor progression; there is no evidence that CEACAM1 affects tumor invasion or metastasis. Second, MMPs and their inhibitors do not cause endothelial cell apoptosis. Rather, they exert their effects indirectly by degradation of basement membrane. Therefore, the CEACAM1-induced factor is probably not an MMP or an MMP inhibitor.Other known angiogenesis inhibitors include angiostatin (41O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A.

Thus, it seems that angiogenic inhibitors can be fragments of proteins whose functions are not related to angiogenesis. It will be interesting to see whether the CEACAM1-induced factor is a fragment of a known protein. In any event, it is very likely that the CEACAM1-induced factor is a previously unknown molecule.

https://openalex.org/W2019424234,"Interaction of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) crystals with renal cells has been shown to result in altered gene expression, DNA synthesis, and cell death. In the current study the role of a stress-specific p38 MAP kinase-signaling pathway in mediating these effects of COM crystals was investigated. Exposure of cells to COM crystals (20 μg/cm2) rapidly stimulated strong phosphorylation and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAP kinase) and re-initiation of DNA synthesis. Inhibition of COM crystal binding to the cells by heparin blocked the effects of COM crystals on p38 MAPK activation. We also show that specific inhibition of p38 MAPK by 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl) imidazole (SB203580) or by overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of p38 MAP kinase abolishes COM crystal-induced re-initiation of DNA synthesis. The inhibition is dose-dependent and correlates with in situ activity of native p38 MAP kinase, determined as mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAP kinase-2) activity in cell extracts. In summary, inhibiting activation of p38 MAPK pathway abrogated the DNA synthesis in response to COM crystals. These data are the first demonstrations of activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway by COM crystals and suggest that, in response to COM crystals, this pathway transduces critical signals governing the re-initiation of DNA synthesis in renal epithelial cells.

The majority of people do not form renal stones despite crystalluria (1Menon M. Koul H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 74: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Up to 1.1 × 107 crystals are excreted daily by normal individuals without any evidence of stone disease (2Robertson W.G. Peacock M. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1972; 43: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It is therefore believed that uncomplicated crystalluria does not indicate kidney stone disease. The mechanisms by which urinary crystals are retained in the kidney and grow into kidney stones are not known. Finlayson (3Finlayson B. Urol. Clin. North Am. 1974; 1: 181-212PubMed Google Scholar) calculated that, given the most favorable conditions, it would take 10 h for 1-μm COM crystals to grow large enough to block the duct of Bellini and become the nidus of a urinary stone. Because urinary transit time from glomerulus to the renal pelvis is ∼3 min, crystalline particles formed in the urine flowing freely through the renal tubule do not stay in the lumen long enough to attain the dimensions required to block a collecting duct and form a urinary microlith. Therefore, the attachment of crystals to the renal epithelial cells and the cellular responses to crystal interaction are critical in understanding the pathogenesis of renal calcification.Previous studies (4Koul H.K.

Furthermore, the receptors that interact with COM crystals in tubular cells may be only minimally exposed under normal circumstances and increase in number under a variety of conditions that lead to cellular stress and injury (4Koul H.K.

However, the specific signaling pathways activated in renal cells following crystal exposure are not delineated.Signal transduction via mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases plays a key role in a variety of cellular responses, including proliferation, differentiation, and cell death (14Brunet A.

MAP kinases have provided a focal point for remarkably rapid advances in our understanding of the control of cellular events by growth factors and stresses (19Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). So far over a dozen MAPK families have been identified. Each cascade consists of no fewer than three enzymes that are activated in a series. These regulatory cascades not only convey information to the target effectors but also coordinate incoming information from parallel signaling pathways, which allow for signal amplification, generation of a threshold, and a sigmoidal activation profile and is subject to multiple activation mechanisms (20Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). These pathways include the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK, also known as p42/44 MAP kinase), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK, also known as SAPK1), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAP kinase, also known as SAPK2/reactivating kinase). In general, ERK1 and ERK2 are key transducers of proliferation signals and are often activated by mitogens. In contrast, SAPKs/JNKs and p38 are poorly activated by mitogens but strongly activated by cellular stress inducers (21Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar).The family of p38 MAP kinases is activated in response to diverse extracellular stimuli including osmotic stress, UV irradiation, heat shock, ionizing radiation, high osmotic stress, shear stress, proinflammatory cytokines, thrombin, epidermal growth factor, and hemopoietic growth factors with the exception of interleukin-4 (21Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The majority, but not all, of these stimuli are associated with cellular stress. The p38 MAP kinase pathway has been shown to mediate signals for the generation of important biological responses, such as phosphorylation of transcription factors involved in transcriptional regulation, platelet aggregation, induction of cytokine production, and apoptosis in neuronal cells and fibroblasts (22Kramer R.M.

Because of the important role that the p38 family of kinases plays in the generation of biological responses under a variety of stress conditions, we set out to determine the effects of COM crystals on p38 MAP kinase-signaling pathway.In this study, we investigated the effect of COM crystals on LLC-PK1 cells, a line of renal epithelial cells. We used SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase. The kinase-dead dominant negative expression vector pCMV-p38 (AGF), which functions as a dominant inhibitor of p38 MAPK activation (27Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar), was also used to determine the role of p38 MAP kinase pathway in mediating the cellular response to COM crystals. We provide the first evidence that p38 MAP kinase is rapidly and robustly phosphorylated and activated in response to COM crystal interaction with renal epithelial cells. In addition, we demonstrate that p38 MAP kinase activity is essential for the effects of COM crystals on re-initiation of DNA synthesis.DISCUSSIONThe results demonstrate that COM crystals stimulate phosphorylation and enzymatic activation of p38 MAP kinase (Figs. 1 and2). Diverse extracellular stimuli have been shown to trigger the p38 MAP kinase pathway (21Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The majority but not all of these stimuli are associated with cellular stress. Upon exposure to COM crystals, renal cells have been shown to display a program of events consistent with cellular stress (9Hammes M.S. Lieske J.C. Pawar S. Spargo B.H. Toback F.G. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 501-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Khan S.R. Urol. Res. 1995; 23: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 11Koul H.

Physiol. 1992; 262: F622-F630PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest involvement of p38 MAP kinase in cellular actions of and/or responses to the COM crystals. Our results demonstrate that COM crystal exposure to renal epithelial cells stimulates enzymatic activation of p38 MAP kinase. The observed correlation of phosphorylation and activation of p38 MAP kinase (Fig.1, A and D) is consistent with the evidence that phosphorylation of tyrosine at TGY activation motif is required for enzymatic activity (27Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar, 34Doza Y.N. Cuenda A. Thomas G.M. Cohen P. Nebreda A.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The activation of p38 MAP kinase by COM crystals in LLC-PK1 was rapid and robust. Our results also demonstrate that COM crystal exposure resulted in situ activation of p38 MAP kinase. Results presented in Fig. 3 demonstrate that heparin, the most effective natural polysaccharide inhibitor of COM crystal binding to the renal epithelial cells (13Verkoelen C.F. Romijn J.C. Cao L.C. Boeve E.R. de Bruijn W.C. Schroder F.H. J. Urol. 1996; 155: 749-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), inhibited COM crystal-induced p38 MAP kinase activity. These data suggest that COM crystal binding to the renal epithelial cells is essential for p38 MAP kinase activation. Activation of the p38 pathway results in a plethora of changes in transcription, protein synthesis, cell surface receptor expression, and cytoskeletal structure, ultimately affecting cell survival or leading to programmed cell death (35Bonventre J.V. Force T. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1998; 7: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 36Derijard B. Hibi M., Wu, I.H. Barrett T., Su, B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

Thus activation of p38 MAP kinase cascade is suggestive of a functional role of this kinase cascade in mediating cellular actions of COM crystals.Previous studies (12Lieske J.C. Walsh-Reitz M.M. Toback F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F622-F630PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that COM crystal exposure to monkey kidney epithelial cells of the nontransformed BSC-1 line and canine kidney epithelial cells (Madin-Darby canine kidney cells) resulted in DNA synthesis. In the present study, we confirmed these effects in LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 4 A). Moreover, the stimulation of DNA synthesis following COM crystal exposure was dose-dependent (Fig. 4 A). These results demonstrated that like BSC-1 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, LLC-PK1 cells also responded to COM crystal exposure by re-initiation of the DNA synthesis.We observed that pretreatment of cells with SB203580 also inhibited COM crystal-stimulated DNA synthesis. The inhibition of COM crystal-stimulated DNA synthesis also showed dose dependence (Fig.5 A). SB203580, a selective and specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, has been used as a versatile agent to investigate the role of p38 MAP kinase pathway in several studies (33Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M.

It has been demonstrated that SB203580 specifically inhibited p38 MAP kinase and had no effect on ERK1/ERK2 and JNK signaling pathways and several other kinases (41Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Strickler J.E., Mc Laughen M.M. Seimens I.R. Fisher S.M. Levy G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L. Young P.R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that, of the known isoforms of p38 MAP kinases, p38 and p38β are the only p38 MAP kinases relevant to the study of kidney cells (42Sheikh-Hamad D. Mari J.D. Suki W.N. Safirstein R. Watts III, B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1832-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). SB203580 inhibits both p38 and p38β. Thus we evaluated the effects of SB203580 on COM crystal-induced in situ activity of p38 MAP kinase. Results presented in Fig. 4 demonstrate that pre-treatment of cells with SB203580 inhibited COM crystal-stimulated in situ activity of p38 MAP kinase as measured by MAPKAP kinase-2 activity. Moreover, SB203580 inhibited MAPKAP kinase-2 activity in a concentration-dependent manner with complete inhibition at 20 μm, indicating total inhibition of COM crystal-stimulated p38 MAP kinase activation (Fig. 5 B). There was a striking similarity between the inhibitions of COM crystal-stimulated p38 MAP kinase activity and COM crystal-stimulated DNA synthesis by SB203580. This suggests the involvement of p38 MAP kinase signal transduction in COM crystal-induced re-initiation of the DNA synthesis in renal epithelial cells.The role of p38 MAP kinase in COM crystal-stimulated DNA synthesis was confirmed by kinase-dead dominant negative expression of p38 MAP kinase that allowed us to inhibit specifically the activity of p38, thereby enabling us to determine the role of p38 MAP kinase pathway. This was made possible by the availability of kinase-dead dominant negative expression vector pCMV-p38 (AGF) (27Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2038) Google Scholar), which has been widely used to study the role of p38 MAP kinase (44Jing Q. Xin S.M. Zhang W.B. Wang P. Qin Y.W. Pei G. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 45Kishore R. McMullen M.R. Nagy L.E. J. Biol.

Res. 2001; 11: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Results presented in Fig. 6show that the overexpression of kinase-dead dominant negative mutant of p38 MAP kinase (p38 (AGF)) resulted in attenuation of COM crystal-induced p38 MAP kinase activity as well as COM-induced re-initiation of the DNA synthesis. Taken together these studies clearly establish involvement of the p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway in COM crystal-induced DNA synthesis. InSchizosaccharomyces pombe the p38 MAP kinase homologue Spc1 is needed for cell cycle progression under stressful conditions, and overexpression of Pyp-1, a tyrosine phosphatase that inactivates Spc1, results in slowing of growth (47Shiozaki K. Russell P. Nature. 1995; 378: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). p38 MAP kinase plays a critical role in DNA synthesis in response to hemopoietic growth factors with the exception of interleukin-4 (48Foltz I.N. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3296-3301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Similarly in fibroblasts and cultured mesangial cells, hypoxia-associated DNA synthesis but not serum-stimulated DNA synthesis has been shown to be dependent on the activation of p38 MAP kinase pathway (49Das M. Bouchey D.M. Moore M.J. Hopkins D.C. Nemenoff R.A. Stenmark K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15631-15640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 50Hu Y. Metzler B. Xu Q. J.

Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 691-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed that p38 MAP kinase activation is critical for oxalate induced re-initiation of the DNA synthesis in the renal epithelial cells (31Chaturvedi L. Koul S. Sekhon A. Bhandari A. Menon M. Koul H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13321-13330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest that p38 MAP kinase activation may play a central role in DNA synthesis associated with cellular stress. Several studies have also implicated p38 MAP kinase in the induction of apoptosis (21Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Withdrawal of nerve growth factor from PC-12 cells has been shown to stimulate apoptosis in p38 MAP kinase-dependent manner (52Dez Utter G.S. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 98: 6168-6173Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similarly p38 MAP kinase-dependent apoptosis has been shown in transforming growth factor-β1-induced apoptosis in murine hepatocytes and in cytokine-induced rat islet cell apoptosis (7Thamilselvan S. Khan S.R. J. Nephrol. 1998; 11 suppl. 1: 66-69PubMed Google Scholar, 46Liao J.H. Chen J.S. Chai M.Q. Zhao S. Song J.G. Cell. Res. 2001; 11: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Whether or not p38 MAP kinase plays any role in renal epithelial cell apoptosis following COM crystal exposure has not been evaluated and needs further study.The mechanisms by which p38 MAP kinase regulates COM crystal-stimulated DNA synthesis are not understood. p38 MAP kinase is known to phosphorylate and activate a number of transcription factors as follows: Elk-1 and ATF2, cAMP-response element-binding protein, and ATF1 through MAPKAP kinase-2 (24Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 43Jiang Y. Chen C., Li, Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Additionally, a number of substrates of p38 kinase have been identified. These include other kinases such as p38-regulated/activated protein kinase, MAP kinase-interacting kinase 1 and 2 (MNK1/2), mitogen, stress-activated kinase 2 (MSK1)/RLPK, ribosomal S6 kinase-B (RSK-B), transcription factors such as activation transcription factor 2 and 6 (ATF2 and ATF6), myocyte enhancer factor 2C, C/EBP homologous protein, SAP-1P, and cytosolic proteins such as stathmin. These transcription factors control the expression of various genes (54Cohen G. Farooqui R. Kesler N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4890-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), which have been demonstrated to play a key role in cell growth and cellular homeostasis. These observations suggest that the effects of p38 MAP kinase may be complex. Additional studies are required to investigate these mechanisms.The mechanisms involved in kidney stone formation remain poorly understood. Renal epithelial cells have been shown to bind COM crystals and display a program of events, including gene expression and re-initiation of the DNA synthesis in response to the crystals (4Koul H.K.

Physiol. 1992; 262: F177-F184PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, interaction of COM crystals with renal epithelium is believed to be a critical step in stone formation (4Koul H.K. Koul S. Fu S. Santosham V. Seikhon A. Menon M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 14: S417-S421Google Scholar, 5Lieske J.C. Toback F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F800-F807PubMed Google Scholar, 6Riese R.J. Riese J.W. Kleinman J.G. Wiessner J.H. Mandel G.S. Mandel N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F1025-F1032PubMed Google Scholar). The present study, by demonstrating the central role of p38 MAP kinase signal transduction in mediating the cellular effects following cell-crystal interactions, may provide an opportunity to identify specific targets in treatment of stone disease.In summary, these studies demonstrate that COM crystal interaction with renal epithelial cells results in rapid and robust activation of p38 MAP kinase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that p38 MAP kinase activity is essential for the effects of COM crystals on re-initiation of DNA synthesis. Thus, p38 MAP kinase signal transduction pathway, by mediating the effects of COM crystals, could play a key role in nephrolithiasis. Renal tubular fluid is commonly supersaturated with calcium and oxalate ions, which nucleate to form crystals of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM),1 the most common constituent of kidney stones. The majority of people do not form renal stones despite crystalluria (1Menon M. Koul H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 74: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Up to 1.1 × 107 crystals are excreted daily by normal individuals without any evidence of stone disease (2Robertson W.G. Peacock M. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1972; 43: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It is therefore believed that uncomplicated crystalluria does not indicate kidney stone disease. The mechanisms by which urinary crystals are retained in the kidney and grow into kidney stones are not known. Finlayson (3Finlayson B. Urol. Clin. North Am. 1974; 1: 181-212PubMed Google Scholar) calculated that, given the most favorable conditions, it would take 10 h for 1-μm COM crystals to grow large enough to block the duct of Bellini and become the nidus of a urinary stone. Because urinary transit time from glomerulus to the renal pelvis is ∼3 min, crystalline particles formed in the urine flowing freely through the renal tubule do not stay in the lumen long enough to attain the dimensions required to block a collecting duct and form a urinary microlith. Therefore, the attachment of crystals to the renal epithelial cells and the cellular responses to crystal interaction are critical in understanding the pathogenesis of renal calcification.

Furthermore, the receptors that interact with COM crystals in tubular cells may be only minimally exposed under normal circumstances and increase in number under a variety of conditions that lead to cellular stress and injury (4Koul H.K.

https://openalex.org/W2084467721,"Heme is an essential component in oxygen transport and metabolism in living systems. In non-erythropoietic cells, 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS1) is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway. ALAS1 expression and heme levels are increased in vivo by drugs and other chemical inducers of cytochrome P450 hemoproteins through mechanisms that are poorly understood. In the present studies, a chicken genomic cosmid library was employed to isolate a major portion of the ALAS1 gene. Two drug-responsive enhancer sequences, 176 and 167 base pairs in length, were identified in the 5′-flanking region of the gene in reporter gene assays in the hepatoma cell line LMH. The relative potency of inducers to activate these enhancers corresponds to induction of ALAS1 mRNA levels in LMH cells. Analysis of putative transcription factor binding sites within the enhancers revealed DR5 and DR4 type recognition sequences for nuclear receptors. Drug activation of the enhancer elements was reduced at least 60% after mutagenesis of individual nuclear receptor binding sites and was virtually eliminated following alteration of both recognition sites within the respective elements. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transactivation studies demonstrate direct interactions between the nuclear receptor binding sites and the recently described chicken xenobiotic-sensing receptor, (CXR) implicating drug activation mechanisms for ALAS1 similar to those found in inducible cytochrome(s) P450. This is the first report describing direct transcriptional activation of ALAS1 by drugs via drug-responsive enhancer sequences.

Two drug-responsive enhancer sequences, 176 and 167 base pairs in length, were identified in the 5′-flanking region of the gene in reporter gene assays in the hepatoma cell line LMH. The relative potency of inducers to activate these enhancers corresponds to induction of ALAS1 mRNA levels in LMH cells. Analysis of putative transcription factor binding sites within the enhancers revealed DR5 and DR4 type recognition sequences for nuclear receptors. Drug activation of the enhancer elements was reduced at least 60% after mutagenesis of individual nuclear receptor binding sites and was virtually eliminated following alteration of both recognition sites within the respective elements. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transactivation studies demonstrate direct interactions between the nuclear receptor binding sites and the recently described chicken xenobiotic-sensing receptor, (CXR) implicating drug activation mechanisms for ALAS1 similar to those found in inducible cytochrome(s) P450. This is the first report describing direct transcriptional activation of ALAS1 by drugs via drug-responsive enhancer sequences. 5-Aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) 1The abbreviations used are: ALAS, 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase; ADRES, aminolevulinic acid drug-responsive enhancer sequence; PB, phenobarbital; DR, hexamer half-site direct repeat; LMH, leghorn male hepatoma; NF1, nuclear factor 1; CYP, cytochrome(s) P450; CXR, chicken xenobiotic receptor; PXR, pregnane X receptor; RXR, 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor; PIA, propylisopropylacetamide; PCN, 5-pregnen-3β-ol-20-one-16α-carbonitrile; TCPOBOP, 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene; LUC, luciferase; mifepristone, RU-486; clotrimazole, 1-[o-chlorotrityl]-imidazole; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; NR, nuclear receptor. is the first and rate-limiting enzyme in the heme biosynthesis pathway (1May B.K.

In eukaryotes, there exist two isoforms of ALAS that are encoded by distinct genes located on different chromosomes. The erythroid form ALAS2 is expressed in hematopoietic tissue and is essential for the generation of functional hemoglobin in erythrocytes, whereas ALAS1 is the drug-responsive, housekeeping form that is expressed ubiquitously, providing heme for CYPs and other hemoproteins. Defects in genes encoding enzymes in the heme biosynthesis pathway are associated with a family of serious disorders known as porphyrias, in which neuropsychiatric symptoms are precipitated by drugs and are associated with increased ALAS1 (2Sassa S. Int. J. Hematol. 2000; 71: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar). Because ALAS is the rate-limiting enzyme in the heme pathway, it has been the focus of numerous studies examining the mechanisms of coordinated heme and apocytochrome synthesis during drug induction of cytochromes P450 (1May B.K.

The mechanism of ALAS transcriptional regulation by xenochemicals has remained enigmatic. Under normal physiological conditions, free heme levels are low and tightly regulated, as toxicity can occur with increased cellular concentrations of unincorporated heme. Following administration of drugs such as phenobarbital (PB) or other prototypical CYP inducers, heme concentrations are elevated in the liver to accommodate the increased levels of heme-dependent enzymes (2Sassa S. Int. J. Hematol. 2000; 71: 1-17PubMed Google Scholar, 6Granick S. Sinclair P. Sassa S. Grieninger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 9215-9225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is achieved by induction of ALAS1 and assures an adequate and apparently coordinated supply of heme for the generation of functional cytochrome holoproteins. After accumulation of ALAS1 mRNA and protein, free heme represses hepatic ALAS1 by a number of negative feedback mechanisms that can inhibit the transport of ALAS1 into the mitochondria, increase heme degradation by inducing heme oxygenase, and decrease ALAS1 mRNA stability directly (5Cable E.E. Miller T.G. Isom H.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 384: 280-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this way, the cell can provide an adequate supply of heme when required while preventing the potentially dangerous accumulation of heme and heme precursors. Recent studies have demonstrated that the induction of CYPs by drugs is mediated by several orphan nuclear receptors (NRs), members of a superfamily of DNA-binding proteins that act as transcription factors. NRs regulate genes as homodimers, heterodimers, or monomers by binding to specific DNA response elements (7Gronemeyer H. Laudet V. Protein Profile. 1995; 2: 1173-1308PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar, 9Steinmetz A.C. Renaud J.P. Moras D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 329-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A number of NRs heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor (RXR), and these dimers then bind to cognate DNA recognition elements, which normally consist of two hexamer half-sites spaced by a variable number of nucleotides, and subsequently modify transcription rates of the targeted genes. In particular, NRs such as chicken xenobiotic receptor (CXR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), and constitutive androstane receptor have been shown to play crucial roles in the induction of members of the drug metabolizing cytochromes from the subfamilies 2H and 2C in chicken (10Handschin C.

In the present work, we describe the characterization of two drug-responsive elements isolated from the 5′-flanking region of the gene encoding ALAS1. These regions respond to a wide range of drugs and are referred to as aminolevulinic acid synthase drug-responsive enhancer sequence (ADRES) elements. Site-directed mutagenesis data demonstrate ADRES-mediated drug response to be conferred by DR4 and DR5 NR recognition sequences. Our data also suggest an important role for additional transcription factors including potential co-activators and/or co-repressors in conferring full drug response. Gel-shift assays and transactivations support the hypothesis that CXR is responsible for the transcriptional activation of the ALAS1 gene by drugs. The observed effects of drugs on ALAS1 mRNA transcription in LMH cells closely mirror the pattern of induction exhibited by the ADRES elements in response to diverse chemical inducers. These studies are the first to demonstrate the direct transcriptional activation of the ALAS1 gene by drugs via well defined drug-responsive enhancer units. Dexamethasone, 2-methyl-1,2-di-3-pyridyl propadone (metyrapone), 5-pregnene-3β-ol-20-one-16α-carbonitrile (PCN), and rifampicin were purchased from Sigma. Propylisopropylacetamide (PIA) was a gift from Dr. Peter Sinclair (Veterans Affairs Hospital, White River Junction, VT). Glutethimide was purchased from Aldrich. Mifepristone (RU-486) was obtained from Roussel-UCLAF. 1,4-Bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP) was generously provided by U. Schmidt (Institute of Toxicology, Bayer, Wuppertal, Germany). Phenobarbital sodium salt (5-ethyl-5-phenylbarbituric acid sodium salt) was purchased from Fluka. Tissue culture reagents, media, and sera were purchased from Invitrogen. All other reagents and supplies were obtained from standard sources. The pGL3LUC luciferase reporter containing an SV40 promoter was purchased from Promega. The reporter plasmid was modified by the addition of the fragment spanning the SacI to theXhoI restriction endonuclease sites of the multiple cloning site of the pBluescript SK vector (Stratagene) to the pGL3LUC vector, thus greatly enhancing the cloning versatility of the new pLucMCS reporter. The pBLCAT5 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter vector was described previously (19Boshart M. Kluppel M. Schmidt A. Schutz G. Luckow B. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 110: 129-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Chicken CXR and RXR were cloned into the pSG5 expression vector (Stratagene) as previously reported (10Handschin C. Podvinec M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10769-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The pRSV β-galactosidase vector used for normalization of transfection experiments was kindly provided by Anastasia Kralli (Biozentrum, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland). A specific probe for the ALAS1 gene was generated via PCR using chicken embryo liver genomic DNA as template and forward primer 5′-cgg gca gca ggt cga gga ga-3′ and reverse primer 5′-cag gaa cgg gca ttt tgt agc a-3′. The probe was32P-radiolabeled using the random primer labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to instructions from the manufacturer. A genomic cosmid library generated from adult male Leghorn chicken liver was purchased from CLONTECH. The ALAS1 probe was used to identify an individual cosmid clone containing the ALAS1 gene, and at least 15 kb of 5′-flanking region was isolated and confirmed by sequencing. The cosmid containing the ALAS1 gene and flanking region was digested with EcoRI restriction endonuclease, and subfragments of the ∼35 kb of new sequence were cloned into the EcoRI site of the pLucMCS vector. Eight fragments ranging in size from 10 kb to 900 bp in length were cloned. In addition, a 3282-bp SmaI fragment encoding the ALAS1 promoter region and proximal 5′-flanking region was cloned into pLucMCS. The drug-responsive 8-kb EcoRI region was then further subdivided using standard subcloning procedures and restriction endonucleases to isolate the Sau3AI-SmaI 176-bp element and the PvuII-HaeIII 167-bp element. Single copies of the 176- and 167-bp wild type and mutated elements were cloned into pBLCAT5 by excising a 222-bp fragment containing the desired sequences with BamHI and BglII restriction endonucleases and ligating them intoBamHI-linearized pBLCAT5 vector. Multiple repeats of the 176-bp wild type and mutant elements were subcloned by inserting the 222-bp fragment four times in succession into theBamHI-linearized pBLCAT5 vector. Leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultivated in 10-cm dishes in Williams E medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine (2 mm), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (50 IU/ml). Dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin were used for routine culture of LMH cells to facilitate proper seating of the cells onto the plastic plate surface. For transfections, cells were seeded onto 12-well Falcon 3043 dishes and expanded to 70–80% surface density. Cells were then maintained in serum-free Williams E media for 24 h and transfected using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. Cells were treated with drugs or vehicle for 16 h and harvested. For luciferase assays, lysis was performed with 200 μl/well Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and extracts were centrifuged for 1 min to pellet cellular debris. Luciferase assays were performed on supernatants using the luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a Microlite TLX1 luminometer (Dynatech). Relative β-galactosidase activities were determined as described (20Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lou D.Y. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4149-4156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). For CAT assays, cells were lysed with 600 μl/well CAT lysis buffer and extracts were centrifuged for 1 min to pellet cellular debris. Assays were performed using a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. Mutations in the putative NR binding sites were introduced into the ADRES elements by PCR using standard overlap techniques. Briefly, subfragments were amplified with overlapping primers carrying the desired mutations and vector primers. These subfragments were then combined and used as template in a second PCR using vector primers to amplify the full-length mutated fragment, which was subsequently digested with appropriate enzymes and cloned into pLucMCS. The forward vector primer was the RV primer 3, and the reverse vector primer was the GL primer 2 within the pGL3 luciferase vector (Promega). All mutations are shown in bold.

Avian NF1 consensus sequence was generated using 5′-gtt taa agc tgg cac tgt ccc aaa-3′ and 5′-ctt tgg cac agt gcc agc ttt aaa c-3′ forward and reverse primers (21Rupp R.A. Kruse U. Multhaup G. Gobel U. Beyreuther K. Sippel A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2607-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Following PCR overlap, the products were digested with BglII and eitherEcoRI or NotI restriction endonucleases and cloned into pLucMCS. All constructs were verified by sequencing. LMH cells were plated onto 12-well plates, expanded to 70–80% surface density, and incubated in serum-free media for 24 h. Cells were then exposed to either drug or vehicle, and RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. One μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with the Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). PCR was performed using the Taqman PCR core reagent kit (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems) and transcript levels quantitated with an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems). Relative transcript levels were determined using the relative quantitation method measuring the ΔΔCt. The following primers and probes were used in these reactions: ALAS1 (probe, 5′-ttc cgc cat aac gac gtc aac cat ctt-3′; forward primer, 5′-gca ggg tgc caa aac aca t-3′; reverse primer, 5′-tcg atg gat cag act tct tca aca-3′) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (probe, 5′-tgg cgt gcc cat tga tca caa ttt-3′; forward primer, 5′-ggt cac gct cct gga aga tag t-3′; reverse primer, 5′-ggg cac tgt caa ggc tga ga-3′). Transcript levels were measured in separate tubes, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase values were used for normalization of ALAS1 values. Chicken CXR and RXR proteins were expressed using the TNT T7 quick coupled translation system (Promega) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. Ends were filled in with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I in the presence of radiolabeled [α-32P]ATP and purified over a Biospin 6 chromatography column. A volume of labeled oligonucleotide corresponding to 100,000 cpm was used for each reaction in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 40 mm KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P40, 6% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm DTT containing 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC) and 2.5 μl in vitro synthesized proteins as described previously (10Handschin C.

To test for supershifts, 0.5 μl of monoclonal anti-mouse-RXR rabbit antibody (kindly provided by P. Chambon, Université Louis Pasteur, Illkirch, France) were added to the reaction mix. This antibody has been previously tested for interactions with chicken RXR in Western blots (data not shown). The reaction mix was incubated for 20 min at room temperature and electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer followed by autoradiography. Experiments to determine the ability of the nuclear receptors CXR, human PXR, and mouse PXR to mediate induction of ALAS-1 were done in COS-1 monkey kidney cells according to methods previously described (10Handschin C. Podvinec M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10769-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). PXR clones were the generous gift of S. Kliewer (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Briefly, cells were expanded for 3 days on 10-cm Falcon 3003 dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) without phenol red supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. Cells were then plated onto six-well dishes and expanded overnight to ∼30% density. Cells were then rinsed with PBS and maintained for transfection in OptiMEM (Invitrogen) without further additions. Transfection of 1 μg of reporter plus 800 ng of pSV β-galactosidase construct and 50 ng of CXR expression vector was performed using 3 ml/well LipofectAMINE, according to the protocol from the manufacturer. After a 24-h incubation, cells were rinsed with PBS and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% delipidated/charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum containing either drugs or vehicle control was added. After a 16-h induction, cells were rinsed with PBS, lysed in 600 μl of CAT lysis buffer, and assayed for CAT enzyme using the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). CAT levels were then normalized against β-galactosidase levels to compensate for variations in transfection efficiency. A cosmid clone containing an insert ∼35 kb in length, spanning the chicken ALAS1 gene and 15 kb of the 5′-flanking region, was isolated and its sequence analyzed. Three major subclones were generated from the region upstream of the transcriptional start site, including a 3282-bp SmaI fragment and 5056- and 7973-bpEcoRI segments (Fig.1 A). The SmaI clone extends from bp −167 to bp −3449, whereas the EcoRI subfragments span the regions from bp −2347 to bp −7402 and bp −7403 to bp −15376, respectively. These subfragments were cloned into the pLucMCS modified luciferase vector containing an SV40 promoter as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Drug inducibility was measured in transiently transfected LMH cells treated with 600 μm PB and compared with control values. The results revealed the 7973-bp subfragment to be highly inducible with PB, displaying a 32-fold increase in transcriptional activation relative to control values. In comparison, the 5056- and 3282-bp subfragments exhibited virtually no transcriptional activation in response to drug treatment (Fig. 1 C). The 7973-bp subfragment (−15376/−7403) was chosen for further analysis and was divided into numerous subclones in the pLucMCS reporter vector, resulting in the isolation of 176-bp Sau3AI-SmaI and 167-bpPvuII-HaeIII elements (Fig. 1, A andB). These sequences routinely exhibit 25–60-fold induction over control values in reporter gene assays when exposed to PB in LMH cells (Fig. 1 C). All other portions of the 7973-bp fragment were also subcloned but displayed no drug response when tested in LMH cells (data not shown). Because the 176- and 167-bp fragments retain high drug response regardless of orientation or distance from the promoter (data not shown), they are referred to as ADRES enhancers. Recent discoveries have implicated NRs in drug-mediated enzyme induction (10Handschin C. Podvinec M. Meyer U.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10769-10774Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Lehmann J.M. McKee D.D. Watson M.A. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. J. Clin.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). For this reason, we scanned the responsive elements for potential nuclear receptor response sites using a computer algorithm based on a weighted nucleotide distribution matrix compiled from published functional hexamer half-sites (22Podvinec M. Kaufmann M.R. Handschin C. Meyer U.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Two potential binding sites for orphan NRs were identified in each ADRES element, having two direct repeats with 4 nucleotide (DR4) and 5 nucleotide (DR5) separations between half-sites in the 176-bp sequence and two direct repeats with 4 nucleotide (DR4) separations between half-sites in the 167-bp sequence (Fig. 1 B). For clarity, the three DR4 binding sites are labeled according to their occurrence in the gene, with the furthest upstream from the transcription start site called DR4-1 and the closest to the start site DR4-3. The putative DR4-1 is defined by one perfect half-site (AGGTCA) and one imperfect half-site (AGTTGA) at −14186/−14181 and −14176/−14171 respectively, whereas the DR5 site is characterized by an imperfect upstream half-site (AGCTGA) and a perfect downstream half-site (AGGTCA) at −14251/−14246 and −14240/−14235. In the 167-bp sequence, DR4-2 consists of one imperfect upstream half-site (GGATGA) and one perfect downstream half-site (AGTTCA) at −13563/−13558 and −13553/−13548 and DR4-3 has two imperfect half-sites (GTGTCA and GGGGCA) at −13526/−13521 and −13516/−13511. It is interesting to note that the 176-bp ADRES also contains a putative binding site for nuclear factor 1 which overlaps the DR5, spanning bp −14255 to bp −14242, whereas the 167-bp ADRES does not. We next wanted to compare ADRES-mediated ALAS1 induction levels from reporter gene assays with stimulation of transcription in a physiological system. Therefore, ALAS1 mRNA levels were quantified in LMH cells cultured in serum-free medium and 16 h of exposure to a variety of chemical inducers and compared with the induction pattern observed with the same compounds in transient transfections of the ADRES (Fig. 2). The compounds examined include PB (600 μm) and the PB-like inducers PIA (250 μm), glutethimide (500 μm), and the potent mouse CYP 2B inducer TCPOBOP (10 μm). In addition, the common CYP3A inducers dexamethasone (50 μm), metyrapone (400 μm), and 10 μm mifepristone (RU-486) were employed for comparison. We were also interested in the effects of 10 μm PCN and rifampicin (100 μm) because of their species-specific effects on PXR activation and CYP3A induction. Messenger RNA was reverse transcribed, and levels of ALAS1 cDNA were quantified using the Taqman real-time PCR quantification system as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PB was a strong inducer of ALAS1 in LMH cells, increasing RNA levels an average of 16-fold relative to basal transcript levels (Fig. 2). This value was chosen to represent 100% induction, against which all other values are compared. The general inducers PIA and glutethimide, as well as the 3A-specific inducer metyrapone, exhibited the strongest effects upon the ADRES elements, stimulating transcription in excess of levels obtained from PB treatment. In comparison, dexamethasone, PCN, RU-486, and rifampicin had minor or no effects on either mRNA levels or ADRES activation. Moreover, the mouse-specific compound TCPOBOP elicited no response in either mRNA transcription or stimulation of the ADRES in reporter assays. When comparing the induction profiles of the two ADRES elements to each other, very few differences are in evidence. The 167-bp element responds to PB with twice the activation when compared with the 176-bp element. Additionally, the 176-bp element has slightly more affinity for glutethimide than metyrapone, whereas the 167-bp element exhibits a stronger response to metyrapone than glutethimide. These experiments indicate a high degree of similarity in the relative activation of the ADRES elements in reporter gene assays to each other and to mRNA transcript levels from chemically induced LMH cells. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to examine the roles of specific nucleotides within the putative DR5 and DR4 recognition sequences in conferring drug response to the ADRES elements (Fig.3). Mutant constructs of the DR4 and DR5 core recognition sites destroying the putative NR binding sites were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Briefly, primers were used in conjunction with PCR to convert the 5′ and 3′ half-sites of the DR5 to EcoRI and PstI restriction endonuclease sites, respectively. Similarly, the DR4-3 half-sites were converted to EcoRI and NcoI restriction endonuclease sites. Data from a nucleotide distribution matrix for half-sites developed by M. Podvinec in this laboratory was applied to ascertain that the mutated half-sites least resemble functional half-sites. DR4-1 half-sites were obliterated by converting AGGTCA and AGTTGA half-sites to unconserved ACTCGA and ATACCA bases, respectively. Similarly, DR4-2 half-sites were both converted from GGATGA and AGTTCA nucleotides to CCCCAC bases. Primers were used to generate constructs mutated at each individual and both NR binding sites within both of the ADRES elements as shown in Fig. 3. The modified enhancers were examined for response to 600 μm PB in luciferase reporter gene assays, and the results are presented in Fig. 3. These findings indicate that both the DR5 and DR4 recognition sites in the 176-bp ADRES and"

We have previously shown that expression of the gene for CGS is feedback-regulated at the level of mRNA stability, and that the amino acid sequence encoded by the first exon of the CGS gene itself is responsible for the regulation (Chiba, Y., Ishikawa, M., Kijima, F., Tyson, R. H., Kim, J., Yamamoto, A., Nambara, E., Leustek, T., Wallsgrove, R. M., and Naito, S. (1999) Science 286, 1371–1374). To identify the functional region within CGS exon 1, deletion analysis was performed. The results showed that the 41-amino acid region of exon 1 highly conserved among plants is necessary and sufficient for the regulation. Analyses of in vivo and in vitrogenerated mutations that abolish the regulation identified the functionally important amino acids as 11–13 residues within this conserved region. The importance of these residues was confirmed by deletion analysis within the conserved region. These studies identified the functional region of CGS exon 1 required for the posttranscriptional autoregulation of the CGS gene as (A)RRNCSNIGVAQ(I), with uncertainty of the first and last residues. This sequence is almost perfectly conserved among CGS sequences of higher plants but cannot be found elsewhere in the public databases.

Mudd S.H. Datko A.H. Plant Physiol. 1985; 77: 450-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction is catalyzed by cystathionine γ-synthase (CGS1; EC 4.2.99.9) and has been proposed to be the key regulatory step in the biosynthesis pathway (2Giovanelli J. Rennenberg H.

Studies with Arabidopsis mto1 mutants, which overaccumulate soluble Met (5Inaba K. Fujiwara T. Hayashi H. Chino M. Komeda Y. Naito S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), have shown that expression of the CGS gene is feedback-regulated at the level of mRNA stability in response to Met application and that the mto1 mutations impair this regulation (6Chiba Y.

Five independently isolated mto1 mutations were found to carry single-base changes within the coding region of the first exon of CGS, each altering the amino acid sequence. The mutated amino acids were clustered in a small region that is highly conserved among four plant species (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Analysis of chimeric constructs carrying the coding region of CGS exon 1 fused in frame to a reporter gene under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S RNA promoter in both transient expression experiments and transgenic plants suggested that the exon 1 region is responsible for the posttranscriptional regulation of CGS gene expression (6Chiba Y.

Synonymous changes introduced into the amino acid codons altered by the mto1 mutations did not impair the regulation, indicating that it is the amino acid sequence and not the nucleotide sequence that has a role in the regulation (6Chiba Y.

Co-transfection experiments and genetic crosses of transgenic plants suggested that CGS exon 1 acts in cis. Based on these observations, we have proposed a model in which the regulation occurs during translation when the nascent polypeptide of CGS exon 1 is in close proximity to its own mRNA (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 7Suzuki A. Shirata Y. Ishida H. Chiba Y. Onouchi H. Naito S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Several cis-acting nascent polypeptides involved in control of gene expression have been reported (for review, see Refs. 8Morris D. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar and 9Lovett P.S. Rogers E.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 366-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In most cases, a cis-acting polypeptide is encoded by an upstream open reading frame and controls translation of the downstream gene. The regulation observed in the CGS gene system, in which thecis-acting polypeptide is encoded within the main coding sequence and affects its own mRNA stability, is highly unique, with few similar cases (10Yen T.J. Machlin P.S. Cleveland D.W. Nature. 1988; 334: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11Theodorakis N.G. Cleveland D.W. Belasco J. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability.

We report here the identification of the functional region within CGS exon 1 required for posttrancriptional regulation of CGS gene expression, providing further insight into this mechanism.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 123: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Extraction of total RNA from rosette leaves and Northern blot analysis were performed as described (7Suzuki A. Shirata Y. Ishida H. Chiba Y. Onouchi H. Naito S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Full-length CGS exon 1 (amino acids 1–183) constructs that contain either wild-type ormto1-1 exon 1 sequences fused in-frame withEscherichia coli β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene and placed under the control of the CaMV 35 S RNA promoter have been described (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mto1-1 mutant versions of this plasmid are referred to as pMI4(WT) and pMI4(mto1-1), respectively. The forward and reverse primers Ex1P1 (5′-CGAATCTAGAATGGCCGTCTC-3′) and Ex1P2 (5′-ATCTAGGATCCACCGGCATG-3′) that were used to amplify the exon 1 sequences by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) carryXbaI and BamHI recognition sequences (underlined), respectively (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The deletion series of CGS exon 1 was constructed by PCR amplification of the respective regions using pMI4(WT) as a template. For the C-terminal deletions, the forward primer was Ex1P1, and the reverse primers were C1r (5′-GAACCGGATCCATCTGGATC-3′), C2r (5′-ATCCTGGATCCTAATCCAGCGTC-3′), C3r (5′-AAGGATCCGGATGGGTTG-3′), and C4r (5′-ACGACGGATCCCGCGGCAGCCACAG-3′) for CD1 (deletion of amino acids 28–183), CD2 (amino acids 58–183), CD3 (amino acids 99–183), and CD4 (amino acids 137–183), respectively. The reverse primers carry a BamHI recognition sequence (underlined). For the N-terminal deletions, the forward primers were N5f (5′-CGTCTAGA ATGGCCGTCTCACTCGTCGGTTCTCCC-3′), N6f (5′-CGTCTAGA ATGGCCGTCTCATCCTCCAGGATCTTAAGA-3′), N7f (5′-GCTCTAGA ATGGCCGTCTCATCCGCGTTACCTTCGG-3′), and N8f (5′-AATCTAGA ATGGCCGTCTCACCTCCCGTCGTGCTG-3′) for ND5 (deletion of amino acids 5–27), ND6 (amino acids 5–57), ND7 (amino acids 5–98), and ND8 (amino acids 5–136), respectively. These primers carry an XbaI recognition sequence (underlined) and the first four amino acid codons of CGS exon 1 (italicized). The latter sequence was introduced to provide the same context around the initiation codon. The reverse primer for the N-terminal deletions was Ex1P2. For those constructs carrying deletions in both N and C termini, the forward and reverse primers were N5f and C3r for IR1 (deletion of amino acids 5–27 and 99–183), N5f and C4r for IR2 (amino acids 5–27 and 137–183), N6f and C3r for IR3 (amino acids 5–57 and 99–183), and N6f and C4r for IR4 (amino acids 5–57 and 137–183). The PCR products were cloned into XbaI and BamHI sites of pTF33 (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Fujiwara T. Naito S. Chino M. Nagata T. Plant Cell Rep. 1991; 9: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) between CaMV 35 S RNA promoter and GUS reporter gene. The dL1 and dR1 constructs carry small deletions within the conserved region of CGS exon 1. For the construction of dL1, the region covering the amino acids 1–60 was amplified using the primers Ex1P1 (forward) and L1n (reverse; 5′-AATCTGCCGGCCCTGGAGGATAA-3′), and the region covering amino acids 69 to 183 was amplified using primers L1c (forward; 5′-CTCCTGCCGGCGTCCGTCAGCTG-3′) and Ex1P2 (reverse). Both the L1n and L1c primers carry a NaeI restriction site (underlined), and the dL1 deletion was generated by ligating the two PCR products at the NaeI site prior to insertion into pTF33 as described above. Due to the NaeI site insertion, an Ala-Gly sequence (GCCGGC) was inserted at the deletion point. The construction of dR1 was similar to that for dL1, except that the regions covering amino acids 1–76 and 88–183 were amplified using the primers Ex1P1 (forward) and R1n (reverse; 5′-TTTCTGCCGGCTTTAATGCTCAG-3′), and R1c (forward; 5′-GTGTTGCCGGCATCGTGGCGGCT-3′) and Ex1P2 (reverse), respectively. In the case of dR1, the first 3 nucleotides of theNaeI site replaced the Ala-76 codon, and thus a glycine codon (GGC) only was inserted at the deletion point. For the deletion constructs retaining the mto1-1mutation site, namely CD3, CD4, ND5, ND6, IR1, IR2, IR3, IR4, and dL1,mto1-1 mutant versions of each construct were generated using pMI4(mto1-1) as the template for PCR amplification. Alanine substitution mutagenesis (17Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) and amino acid changes at the Ser-81 position (Table I) were carried out by the overlap extension PCR method (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar, 19Pogulis R.J. Vallejo A.N. Pease L.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 167-191PubMed Google Scholar). The flanking primers were Ex1P1 and Ex1P2. Sequences of the 62 mutagenic internal primers will be provided upon request. The mutant CGS exon 1 sequences were cloned into pHA0 between theXbaI and BamHI sites. pHA0 is a pUC19 vector that carries the CaMV 35 S RNA promoter:CGS exon 1:GUS:nopaline synthase terminator fragment from PMI4(WT) between the HindIII andEcoRI sites. In all cases, the integrity of PCR-amplified regions was confirmed by sequence analysis. The control construct Δ5–183 that carries only the first four amino acids of CGS exon 1 fused in-frame to the GUS reporter gene and placed under the control of CaMV 35 S RNA promoter has been described (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The 221-LUC+ plasmid carries a modified firefly luciferase gene directly under the CaMV 35 S RNA promoter (20Matsuo N. Minami M. Maeda T. Hiratsuka K. Plant Biotechnol. 2001; 18: 71-75Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and was used as an internal standard for transient expression experiments. Liquid callus cultures ofArabidopsis were prepared as described (21Guzman P. Ecker J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 11091-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Ishikawa M. Naito S. Ohno T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5328-5338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and transfection of tester (GUS reporter) and control (luciferase reporter) plasmids by electroporation was carried out as described (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the coding region of the first exon of CGS (183 amino acids) is sufficient for the regulation of its own mRNA stability (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 7Suzuki A. Shirata Y. Ishida H. Chiba Y. Onouchi H. Naito S. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid sequences and lengths of CGS exon 1 region are not well conserved, there was a region within exon 1 that is highly conserved among four plant species (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the present study, the region between amino acids 58 and 98 of CGS exon 1 is referred to as the conserved region. The observation that the three amino acids altered by previously identified mto1 mutations (mto1-1 to mto1-5) (TableI) were clustered in the conserved region (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) implies an important role for this conserved region in the posttranscriptional regulation of the CGS gene. To identify the functionally important region in CGS exon 1, we isolated additionalmto1 alleles. Two new mutations were identified and designated as mto1-6 and mto1-7, respectively (Table I). These mutations are also located within the conserved region in close proximity to the previously identified mto1mutations (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The seven mto1 alleles we have so far isolated were characterized on the basis of ethionine resistance, soluble Met accumulation, and CGS mRNA accumulation. As shown in Fig.1 A, growth of wild-type plants was severely inhibited by 30 μm ofl-ethionine (5Inaba K. Fujiwara T. Hayashi H. Chino M. Komeda Y. Naito S. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whereas growth of all sevenmto1 mutants was not affected at this concentration ofl-ethionine. mto1-4 and mto1-6mutants showed a weaker resistance to ethionine than the other alleles, and their growth was inhibited in the presence of 100–200 μml-ethionine. Soluble Met concentrations in rosette leaves ofmto1-1, -2, -3, -5, and -7 were 30–40-fold higher than wild-type (Fig. 1 B). On the other hand, mto1-4 andmto1-6 accumulated lower concentrations of soluble Met than the other alleles, consistent with its weak ethionine-resistant phenotype. CGS mRNA accumulated to higher levels than wild-type plants in allmto1 mutant alleles (Fig. 1 C). The weakmto1-4 and mto1-6 alleles showed lower levels of CGS mRNA overaccumulation compared with that in the other alleles. These results demonstrate a positive correlation between CGS mRNA accumulation level, soluble Met accumulation level, and ethionine resistance. CGS protein accumulation levels were also similar to that for CGS mRNA accumulation. Although the mto1-3 and mto1-5 mutants were isolated independently, they carry the same mutation (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, these two mutants exhibited similar phenotypes (Fig. 1; data not shown). To test whether the conserved region (amino acids 58–98) is necessary for the ability to down-regulate its own expression in response to Met application, N- and C-terminal deletions of CGS exon 1 were constructed and transient expression studies were carried out (Fig.2). Expression of the deletion constructs that lacked the conserved region (CD1, CD2, ND7, and ND8; Fig.2 A) was not down-regulated in response to applied Met (Fig.2 B), indicating that the conserved region is necessary for the regulation. In contrast, deletion constructs that retained the conserved region (CD3, CD4, ND5, and ND6; Fig. 2 A) did respond to applied Met. Although the level of response was weaker than that for the full-length CGS exon 1 construct (Fig. 2 A,Exon 1), the positive response to applied Met was substantiated by the observation that introduction ofmto1-1 mutation into these constructs totally abolished the response (Fig. 2 C). To test whether the conserved region is sufficient for the regulation, constructs bearing both N- and C-terminal deletions (IR1, IR2, IR3, and IR4; Fig. 2 A) were also generated and tested (Fig.2 B). The results showed that all of these constructs responded to applied Met even when the conserved region alone was used (IR3). Although again the response was weaker than that for the full-length exon 1 construct, introduction ofmto1-1 mutation totally abolished the response (Fig. 2 C). The results indicate that the conserved region is essentially sufficient for the regulation. The full-length exon 1 constructs carrying mto1-6and mto1-7 mutations were generated, and the response to applied Met was tested (Fig. 3). Constructs carrying mto1-1 to mto1-4mutations that we have previously reported (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) were reanalyzed for comparison. As expected, both mto1-6 and mto1-7mutations affected the response, as did the other mto1alleles. In order to determine which amino acids of the conserved region in CGS exon 1 are important for the regulation, effects of alanine substitution mutations (17Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) were studied in the context of full-length exon 1. Of the 41 amino acids in the conserved region, 14 amino acids were individually changed to alanine, and their response to applied Met was tested (Fig. 3). As a result, four additional mutations were identified, namely R77A-1, N79A-1,I83A-1, and Q87A-1, whose changes impaired the response. The change of Ser-81 to alanine in S81A-1, however, did not impair the regulation. This was despite the fact that the regulation was abolished by alteration of the same amino acid residue to asparagine in the mto1-2 mutant. Due to this unexpected result, Ser-81 was changed to all other amino acids and tested further (Fig. 4). The results showed that amino acids with a small side chain, namely serine (wild type), glycine, alanine, and cysteine, were tolerated, whereas changes to those with a larger side chain affected the regulation. Critical amino acids for the regulation identified by alanine substitution mutagenesis were clustered in a small region where all of the mto1 mutations are also located (amino acids 77–87) (Fig. 3). This implied that this 11-amino acid sequence within the conserved region is essential for the regulation of the CGS gene. To confirm this, additional deletion constructs within the conserved region were generated and tested. As expected, deletion of amino acids 77–87 in the dR1 construct (Fig. 2 A) abolished the response to applied Met. In contrast, deletion of amino acids 61–68 in the dL1 construct (Fig. 2 A), a C-terminal part of the conserved region, still showed a response (Fig. 2 B). The positive response of the dL1 construct was evidenced by introduction of the mto1-1 mutation, which totally abolished the response (Fig. 2 C). The results presented in this study identified the region of CGS exon 1 that is critical for the posttranscriptional regulation of its own expression in response to applied Met. We have previously denoted the amino acid sequence defined by mto1 mutations as the MTO1 region (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The results obtained in this study demonstrated that the MTO1 region spans from amino acid 77 to 87 (Arg-Arg-Asn-Cys-Ser-Asn-Ile-Gly-Val-Ala-Gln). Untested Ala-76 and Ile-88 might also be included in the MTO1 region. Changes of amino acids near the border of the MTO1 region (Arg-77, Ala-86, and Gln-87) had a weaker effect on the regulation compared with that in the central part of the MTO1 region (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the weak alleles ofmto1-4 and mto1-6 are among those near the border. Detailed analysis of the Ser-81 position showed that those amino acids with a small side chain are tolerated. Other characteristics such as polar/nonpolar did not seem to affect the regulation (Fig. 4). The most likely interpretation of this result is that amino acids with a larger side chain inhibit the function of the MTO1 region by a structural hindrance at this position. The same rule, however, does not seem to apply for Gly-84, because the mto1-1 mutation that alters this amino acid to serine strongly abolished the regulation. Due to the fact that not all amino acids in the conserved region were tested by alanine substitution mutagenesis and that deletion analysis within the conserved region did not cover all residues, we cannot rule out the possibility that amino acids outside the MTO1 region are also involved in the regulation. No mto1 mutation, however, has been identified outside the MTO1 region from our screens. This is despite the fact that mutations were independently found three times at the same amino acid residue in the MTO1 region (Gly-84 formto1-1, -3, and -5) (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F. Tyson R.H. Kim J. Yamamoto A. Nambara E. Leustek T. Wallsgrove R.M. Naito S. Science. 1999; 286: 1371-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Ethyl methanesulfonate, the mutagen used for mto1 mutant isolation, is known to preferentially produce a guanine-to-adenine change (23Burns P.A. Allen F.L. Glickman B.W. Genetics. 1986; 113: 811-819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kohalmi S.E. Kunz B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Of the 12 possible amino acid substitutions in the MTO1 region, we have identified six mto1 mutations. On the other hand, of the 20 possible amino acid substitutions outside the MTO1 region (but within the conserved region) none was identified, suggesting that the possibility of identifying additionalmto1 mutations outside the MTO1 region is low. Although the conserved region (amino acids 58–98) of CGS exon 1 was capable of responding to Met application on its own, deletions of other regions of exon 1 more or less weakened the response (Fig. 2). Changes in the amino acid sequence flanking the MTO1 region may affect activity of the MTO1 region, such as by affecting proper folding of the MTO1 polypeptide or by preventing access of the MTO1 region to the site of action. The amino acid sequence in the MTO1 region is almost perfectly conserved among 19 plant species whose CGS sequences, either as cDNAs or expressed sequence tags, are currently available in the GenBankTM data base (25Benson D.A. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Rapp B.A. Wheeler D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 A). These species cover multicellular plants and include not only dicots and monocots but also a gymnosperm (loblolly pine) and a moss species (Physcomitrella patens). The only exception to the conservation of the MTO1 region is a valine-to-leucine substitution in one of the CGS isoforms in potato (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, tBLASTn searches (26Altschul S.F.

They also encode a 75-amino acid N-terminal extension sequence but did not contain the MTO1 sequence (data not shown), suggesting that the MTO1 sequence is unique to CGS of multicellular plants. In contrast to the highly conserved nature of the amino acid sequences in the MTO1 region, nucleotide sequences encoding this region carry many synonymous changes (Fig. 5 B). The present observation supports our previous conclusion that it is the amino acid sequence and not the nucleotide sequence that has a role in the regulation (6Chiba Y. Ishikawa M. Kijima F.

However,N-glycosylation does not seem to be relevant to the function of a nascent polypeptide. Although there is still much to be understood regarding regulation of the CGS gene in response to applied Met, the functional amino acid sequence identified in this study provides a critical key to the elucidation of this unique regulatory mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2066949918,"Bezafibrate, an antilipidemic drug, is known as a potent allosteric effector of hemoglobin. The previously proposed mechanism for the allosteric potency of this drug was that it stabilizes and constrains the T-state of hemoglobin by specifically binding to the large central cavity of the T-state. Here we report a new allosteric binding site of fully liganded R-state hemoglobin for this drug. The high resolution crystal structure of horse carbonmonoxyhemoglobin in complex with bezafibrate reveals that the bezafibrate molecule lies near the surface of the E-helix of each α subunit and the complex maintains the quaternary structure of the R-state. Binding is caused by the close fit of bezafibrate into the binding pocket, which is composed of some hydrophobic residues and the heme edge, suggesting the importance of hydrophobic interactions. Upon binding of bezafibrate, the distance between Fe and the Nε2 of distal His E7(α58) is shortened by 0.22 Å in the α subunit, whereas no significant structural changes are transmitted to the β subunit. Oxygen equilibrium studies of R-state-locked hemoglobin with bezafibrate in a wet porous sol-gel indicate that bezafibrate selectively lowers the oxygen affinity of one type of subunit within the R-state, consistent with the structural data. These results disclose a new allosteric mechanism of bezafibrate and offer the first demonstration of how the allosteric effector interacts with R-state hemoglobin.

These results disclose a new allosteric mechanism of bezafibrate and offer the first demonstration of how the allosteric effector interacts with R-state hemoglobin. bezafibrate Hemoglobin is a tetrameric protein that consists of two α subunits and two β subunits arranged around a central water-filled cavity. Each subunit carries one heme group to which one oxygen molecule binds reversibly. The oxygen affinity of each subunit rises as the other hemes in the same tetramer become saturated with oxygen. This cooperative interaction has been explained as the result of a shift in the equilibrium between the two quaternary structures from the low affinity T state to the high affinity R-state (1Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.-P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6127) Google Scholar). The quaternary conformational change consists of a rotation of the symmetrically related αβ dimers by approximately 15° relative to each other and a translation of approximately 0.8 Å along the rotation axis, yielding a narrower central cavity in the R-state than in the T-state (2Baldwin J. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 175-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The oxygen affinity of hemoglobin is further modulated by several non-heme ligands such as protons (3Kilmartin J.V. Breen J.J. Roberts G.C. Ho C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), chloride ions (4Imaizumi K. Imai K. Tyuma I. J.

Biol. 1994; 239: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and 2,3-disphosphoglycerate (6Benesch R. Benesch R.E. Nature. 1969; 221: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 7Arnone A. Nature. 1972; 237: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) that reduce the oxygen affinity by preferentially binding to hemoglobin in the T-state. Besides these natural allosteric effectors, a variety of synthetic molecules has been examined for their capability of lowering the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, because such allosteric modulators are potentially useful for both research and therapeutic applications (8Perutz M.F. Poyart C. Lancet. 1983; 2: 881-882Abstract PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9Randad R.S. Mahran M.A. Mehanna A.S. Abraham D.J. J. Med.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1515-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In 1983, Perutz and Poyart (8Perutz M.F. Poyart C. Lancet. 1983; 2: 881-882Abstract PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) discovered that the antilipidemic drug bezafibrate (BZF)1 (see Fig.1) lowers the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin more strongly than and acts synergistically with the natural effector 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. A subsequent crystallographic study of the human deoxyhemoglobin-BZF complex demonstrated that two molecules of BZF bind to the large central cavity of the T-state deoxyhemoglobin in a symmetrical fashion and that each contacts with one β and two α subunits at a distance from the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding site (11Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Abraham D.J. Poyart C. Bursaux E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 1064-1078Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a previous crystallographic analysis of human R-state carbonmonoxyhemoglobin co-crystallized with BZF (at 4.85 Å resolution) showed no drug bound to the R-state molecule (11Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Abraham D.J. Poyart C. Bursaux E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 1064-1078Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Moreover, earlier solution binding studies indicated that BZF binds only nonspecifically to R-state hemoglobin (11Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Abraham D.J. Poyart C. Bursaux E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 1064-1078Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 12Mehanna A.S. Abraham D.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3944-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The basic assumption underlying the use of BZF for hemoglobin research has been that the drug interacts only to T-state hemoglobin (13Noble R.W. DeYoung A. Vitale S. Cerdonio M. DiIorio E.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5288-5292Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Noble R.W. DeYoung A. Rousseau D.L.

However, some evidence shows that this assumption is not correct. For example, previous laser flash photolysis studies of carbonmonoxyhemoglobin showed that BZF causes a decrease in the CO association rate of R-state hemoglobin by over a factor of 4 (17Marden M.C. Kister J. Bohn B. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Marden M.C. Bohn B. Kister J. Poyart C. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 397-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, Coletta et al. (19Coletta M. Angeletti M. Ascenzi P. Bertollini A. Della Longa S., De Sanctis G. Priori A.M. Santucci R. Amiconi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6865-6874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) measured the oxygen dissociation rate from oxyhemoglobin as a function of BZF concentration and showed that the R-state molecule has saturable binding site(s) for BZF. More recently, Tsuneshige et al. (20Tsuneshige A. Park S. Yonetani T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported that the addition of BZF to stripped hemoglobin markedly lowers the oxygen affinity of the R-state, suggesting some effector-linked tertiary structural changes. Up to now, however, a structural basis to explain such tertiary constraints has been lacking. In this study, we present the high resolution (1.55 Å) x-ray crystal structure of horse carbonmonoxyhemoglobin in complex with BZF and show the location and stereochemistry of the putative binding site of R-state hemoglobin for BZF. To examine further the effect of BZF on the R-state function, we trap the original R conformation of horse carbonmonoxyhemoglobin with BZF by encapsulation in a wet transparent sol-gel. Our previous studies have shown that the encapsulated hemoglobin molecules are in contact with solvent and are capable of binding or releasing small ligands, whereas the gel matrix limits the quaternary structure changes of hemoglobin (21Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Shibayama N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Shibayama N.

Thus, we can determine the oxygen equilibrium properties of the R-state-locked hemoglobin with BZF in the sol-gel. Without this trapping technique, the triply liganded T-state, which may appear in the presence of strong allosteric effector(s), would preclude the determination of the true R-state affinity (18Marden M.C. Bohn B. Kister J. Poyart C. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 397-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An additional advantage of this technique is to resolve the individual oxygen affinities for the α and β subunits. Horse hemolysate was prepared as described by Bolton et al. (25Bolton W. Cox J.M. Perutz M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 283-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The so-called “slow component” fraction was isolated by ion-exchange chromatography on a CM52 cellulose (Whatman) column with a linear gradient from 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.85, to 15 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.60. Single crystals of horse carbonmonoxyhemoglobin (slow component) in complex with BZF (Sigma) were grown using the batch method at 20 °C from CO-saturated 0.25% (w/v) hemoglobin solutions containing 16% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1000, 8 mm BZF, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dithionite, and 50 mm citrate-ammonium buffer, pH 6.8. The mother liquor containing 20% (v/v) glycerol was used as cryoprotectant in which the crystals were rinsed briefly before flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen. High resolution x-ray diffraction data were obtained at 100 K using synchrotron radiation source at RIKEN beam line BL44B2 station of SPring-8 (Harima, Japan) (26Adachi S. Oguchi T. Tanida H. Park S.-Y. Shimizu H. Miyatake H. Kamiya N. Shiro Y. Inoue Y. Ueki T. Iizuka T. Nucl. Instrum. Methods A. 2001; 467–468: 711-714Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Intensity data were collected with a MAR CCD detector. The crystals were mounted with the b axis close to the axis of rotation. The wavelength of the incident x-rays was 0.7 Å. Diffraction data were integrated and scaled with HKL2000 and SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38514) Google Scholar). The initial model of horse carbonmonoxyhemoglobin-BZF complex was obtained by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (28Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19745) Google Scholar). A search model was constructed from the coordinates of horse carbonmonoxyhemoglobin reported recently (29Mueser T.C. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15353-15364Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The refinement of the parameters on rotation and translation by MOLREP (28Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19745) Google Scholar) gave a correlation coefficient of 0.689 and a R-factor of 0.423 for the data at 10–3 Å resolution. The model was submitted to rigid and simulated annealing refinement using slow-cool protocols in X-PLOR 3.851 (30Brunger A.T. X-PLOR version 3.851, X-PLOR (online). Yale University, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar). Several steps of simulated slow-cool annealing were performed followed by model rebuilding using the graphics program TURBO-FRODO (31Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-78Google Scholar). The slow-cool protocol (T = 3000 K) was used to calculate unbiased omit maps. After the inclusion of 150 solvent molecules and modeling of the thermal motion by individual isotropic factors, theR-factor was 21.7% and free R-factor was 24.4% for data between 20.0 and 1.70 Å. This model was further refined using conjugate gradient minimization in SHELX (32Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). For this stage of refinement, the working set of measured intensities and their estimated standard deviations were used in the minimization formula with the standard SHELX weighting scheme. A free R-factor was calculated from the reference reflection set after each round of SHELX refinement. In parallel with manual solvent and protein side-chain remodeling, the resolution was increased to 1.55 Å. Solvent molecules were placed at positions where spherical electron density peaks were found above 1.5ς in the 2F o −F c map and above 3.0ς in theF o − F c map and where the stereochemically reasonable hydrogen bonds were allowed. Structural evaluations of the final model of the carbonmonoxyhemoglobin-BZF complex using PROCHECK (28Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19745) Google Scholar) indicated that 93.5% of the residues are in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot with no residues in “disallowed” regions.

J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This involved the encapsulation of hemoglobin in wet porous sol-gels using the previous protocol (22Shibayama N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), equilibration (22Shibayama N. J. Mol.

Shibayama, manuscript in preparation. removal of CO (23Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 444-445Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the oxygen equilibrium measurement (24Shibayama N. Saigo S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A typical experiment in the presence of BZF is as follows. The silica sol was synthesized from tetramethylorthosilicate (Tokyo Kasei Company, Tokyo, Japan) according to the method of Ellerby et al. (33Ellerby L.M. Nishida C.R. Nishida F. Yamanaka S.A. Dunn B. Valentine J.S. Zink J.I. Science. 1992; 255: 1113-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). The sol was mixed with 1.5 volumes of 0.87% (w/v) horse carbonmonoxyhemoglobin (slow component) in 50 mmcitrate-ammonium buffer, pH 6.7, with 4 mm BZF under CO atmosphere in a rotating sealed glass tube (1-cm diameter) (21Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22Shibayama N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23Shibayama N.

Gelation occurred within 6 min at 0 °C. The resultant carbonmonoxyhemoglobin-doped thin film (i.e. 0.02–0.05-mm thickness), which adhered to the inner surface of the glass tube, was soaked in CO-saturated 50 mm citrate-ammonium buffer, pH 6.7, with 4 mm BZF and was allowed to stand at 0 °C for 1 h. The buffer then was replaced by a fresh one that contained 2 mm sodium dithionite and catalase (6000 units/ml) followed by equilibration under CO atmosphere at 35 °C for 63 h. The equilibrated sol-gel sample was washed with CO-saturated dithionite-free buffer and was immersed in a buffered silica sol composed of one volume of tetramethylorthosilicate and 7.5 volumes of 50 mm citrate-ammonium buffer, pH 6.7, with 4 mm BZF. After 10 min of incubation at 0 °C, the excess silica sol was discarded. The sample then was placed in a water bath at 25 °C and left for 15 min. At this stage, the second sol-gel had formed in the pores of the original sol-gel films. The resultant sol-gel sample was washed with 50 mm citrate-ammonium buffer, pH 6.7, with 4 mm BZF. The encapsulated carbonmonoxyhemoglobin then was converted to oxyhemoglobin (23Shibayama N. Saigo S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 444-445Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The oxygen equilibrium curve of the encapsulated hemoglobin was determined at 15 °C by the method previously described (24Shibayama N. Saigo S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The increment of the met-hemoglobin content during the measurements was always <10%. Reversibility of each oxygen equilibrium curve was confirmed by agreement between the deoxygenation data and the corresponding oxygenation data. Thus, the deoxygenation data were used for a two-component analysis as described by Shibayama (22Shibayama N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proton NMR spectra were measured at 27 °C using a Bruker Avance 600 NMR spectrometer. Proton chemical shifts were referred to internal sodium 3-trimethylsilylpropionate-2,2,3,3-d 4. Suppression of a solvent peak attributed to water was achieved with 3–9-19 pulse sequence with a gradient pulse (Watergate method). Normally, 512 free induction decays were collected over a spectral width of 10 kHz. An exponential line broadening of 1 Hz was applied to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The crystal structure of horse carbonmonoxyhemoglobin in complex with BZF was determined at 1.55 Å resolution (TableI). Fig.2 shows the α1 and β2 subunits of the complex superimposed on those of BZF-free horse carbonmonoxyhemoglobin in the R-state (29Mueser T.C. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15353-15364Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). No significant structural difference is found at the α1β2 contacts (sliding contacts), indicating that the quaternary structure of the complex is identical to that of the BZF-free R-state. We also confirmed that the addition of BZF does not alter the R quaternary structure of horse carbonmonoxyhemoglobin in solution as probed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the hydrogen-bonded region (34Ho C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1992; 43: 153-312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that two molecules of BZF bind in a symmetrical fashion to one tetrameric carbonmonoxyhemoglobin at a binding site distinct from that of T-state deoxyhemoglobin, i.e. the large central cavity in the T-state (see Ref. 11Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Abraham D.J. Poyart C. Bursaux E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 1064-1078Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The BZF molecules bound to carbonmonoxyhemoglobin are well ordered as shown by the 2F o − F c electron density map (Fig. 3 a). Interestingly, each BZF molecule lies near the surface of the E helix of the α subunit with its chlorobenzene ring interacting with one of the heme methyl groups (Figs. 3, b and c, and 4). Also, the chloride moiety of BZF fits into a hydrophobic cavity surrounded by the residues of Ala E14(α65), Leu E17(α68), Leu F1(α80), and Leu F4(α83) (Fig. 4). In addition, one of the methyl groups of the drug is in van der Waals contact with the side chain of Ala E6(α57) (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the most polar carboxylate group of the drug is fully exposed to the solvent. Altogether, the majority of the binding energy is the result of hydrophobic interactions.Figure 4Diagrammatic view of contacts of BZF with surrounding globin residues, heme, and structurally conserved water molecules in the α subunit. Narrow broken lines indicate hydrogen bond and electrostatic interactions, and broad broken lines indicate hydrophobic contacts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two water molecules that mediate hydrogen bonds between BZF and the protein moiety make important contributions to the overall binding of BZF. One water molecule, W1053, links the carbonyl oxygen of BZF to the side chain of Lys E10(α61), whereas the other water molecule, W1001, bridges between the amide hydrogen of BZF and the side chain of Asp E13(α64) (Fig. 4). These two water molecules are well ordered as judged by their low B-factors (19.1 and 10.0 Å2 for W1053 and W1001, respectively). The binding of BZF induces small but significant stereochemical changes around the α heme (Fig. 3 d). In particular, the distance between Fe and the Nε2 of distal His E7(α58) is significantly shortened from 4.50 to 4.28 Å upon binding of BZF because of a shift of the entire E helix with respect to the α heme as evident from a shortened distance between Fe and the Cα of distal His E7(α58) (from 8.53 to 8.36 Å). This movement of the distal His E7(α58) would increase its steric hindrance toward CO, because the Nε2 is at a rather short distance (3.13 Å) form the CO oxygen atom in the presence of BZF (compared with a distance of 3.36 Å in the absence of BZF). The influence of the distal His E7 on CO and oxygen binding to hemoglobin was investigated by Olson et al. (35Mathews A.J. Rohlfs R.J. Olson J.S. Tame J. Renaud J.-P. Nagai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16573-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who demonstrated by means of native and distal pocket mutants of human hemoglobin that the distal His E7 in the R-state α subunit inhibits the bimolecular rate of binding of both CO and oxygen, sterically hinders bound CO, and stabilizes bound oxygen by hydrogen bonding. Thus, it can be reasonably expected that, at least in the case of CO as ligand, BZF would significantly reduce the ligand binding affinity of R-state hemoglobin. This conclusion is consistent with previous findings that the addition of BZF causes a decrease in the CO association rate of R-state human hemoglobin by over a factor of 4 (17Marden M.C. Kister J. Bohn B. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,18Marden M.C. Bohn B. Kister J. Poyart C. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 397-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, in the case of oxygen binding, uncertainty remains as to how the unfavorable steric hindrance is compensated by the formation of the hydrogen bond between the Nε2 of distal His and bound oxygen (35Mathews A.J. Rohlfs R.J. Olson J.S. Tame J. Renaud J.-P. Nagai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16573-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Shaanan B. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 171: 31-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Although the Cγ2 of Val E11(α62) (the nearest carbon atom of this residue to Fe) moves slightly upon the binding of BZF (Fig. 3 d), the distance between Fe and the Cγ2is essentially unchanged. Therefore, it can be presumed that the movement of Val E11(α62) upon binding of BZF makes only a minor contribution to the alteration in the R-state function. The orientations of the other highly conserved (functionally relevant) residues such as His F8(α87) and Phe CD1(α43) remain essentially unchanged. There is no evidence for transmission of the BZF binding-induced structural distortion to the β subunit. It is probable that our observed BZF binding pocket in horse carbonmonoxyhemoglobin is operative in human R-state hemoglobin, because all of the residues in the observed BZF binding pocket are conserved in human hemoglobin with the exception of two residues,i.e. Ala E6(α57) and Leu E17(α68), that are substituted by Gly and Asn, respectively. Furthermore, several lines of evidence indicate that BZF binds specifically to fully liganded R-state human hemoglobin in a functionally relevant way (17Marden M.C. Kister J. Bohn B. Poyart C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1659-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Marden M.C. Bohn B. Kister J. Poyart C. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 397-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Coletta M. Angeletti M. Ascenzi P. Bertollini A. Della Longa S., De Sanctis G. Priori A.M. Santucci R. Amiconi G. J.

Chem. 2002; 98: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We do not yet fully understand the reason why the previous solution binding studies found only a nonspecific binding of BZF with human carbonmonoxyhemoglobin (11Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Abraham D.J. Poyart C. Bursaux E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 1064-1078Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 12Mehanna A.S. Abraham D.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3944-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We found no BZF bound to the β subunit in the R-state horse hemoglobin. Why does BZF bind so specifically to the α subunit? One probable explanation is that in the β subunit, the corresponding binding pocket for the chloride moiety of BZF is narrower and less hydrophobic because of substitutions of Ala E14(α65) to Ser, Leu E17(α68) to Glu, and Leu F1(α80) to Phe. A similar trend is found in human hemoglobin. A second question concerns whether our observed new BZF binding pocket is operative in the T-state molecule. This possibility is probable because the surface of each hemoglobin subunit would not change drastically during the T to R transition. Also, a previous solution binding study of BZF to deoxyhemoglobin (12Mehanna A.S. Abraham D.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3944-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) indicated the presence of two classes of BZF binding sites in the T-state. One primary class of binding sites with two BZF molecules bound per deoxyhemoglobin tetramer has been crystallographically identified as the original “BZF binding site” at the interface of the α and β subunits deep in the central cavity (11Perutz M.F. Fermi G. Abraham D.J. Poyart C. Bursaux E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 1064-1078Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a definite conclusion on the location of the other class of sites could not be drawn. Note that a possible candidate suggested by an earlier study was the surface of the molecule near Trp A12(α14) and Trp A12(β15), but BZF could not be fitted to these sites (12Mehanna A.S. Abraham D.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3944-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Horse carbonmonoxyhemoglobin in the presence or absence of BZF was encapsulated in wet porous sol-gels to lock the original R conformation of hemoglobin during the oxygen equilibrium measurements. Fig.5 shows the Hill plots for the oxygen dissociation curves of such R-state-locked samples with and without BZF at 15 °C under the conditions nearly identical to those for the crystallization. The R-state-locked sample without BZF exhibits a very high affinity for oxygen (i.e. P 50 = 0.14 mm Hg; P 50 is oxygen pressure at half-saturation) corresponding to the oxygen affinity of R-state human hemoglobin in solution at 15 °C (20Tsuneshige A. Park S. Yonetani T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5, the oxygen dissociation curve of this sample falls very close to a straight line with a slope of 1.0, indicating that inequivalence in the oxygen affinity between the α and β subunits is absent or very small. By contrast, the oxygen dissociation curve of the R-state-locked sample with BZF shows a sign of the biphasic behavior with a Hill coefficient less than unity. To obtain more quantitative information from the biphasic curve, we used an analysis in which two independent noncooperative components with different oxygen equilibrium constants are assumed to exist. The analysis shows that the obtained two components differ in affinity by an approximate factor of 5 and more importantly that the effect induced by BZF is exerted only on the lower affinity component, which amounts to 36% of the total (see legend to Fig. 5), suggesting that BZF selectively lowers the oxygen affinity of one type of subunit within the R-state. This conclusion is fully consistent with our current structural data, which show that BZF binding-induced structural distortion is localized at the distal heme pocket of the α heme and not transmitted to the β subunit. Our observation that the fractional population of the lower affinity component probably due to the α subunit was <50% (i.e.36%) is not surprising in view of the fact that we cannot absolutely rule out a contribution arising from the existence of BZF-unbound tetramer, even though the nearly full occupancy of the bound BZF in the crystals (see Fig. 3 a) suggests that this contribution is not large. Our current functional data on the R-state-locked hemoglobin with and without BZF are consistent at least qualitatively with recent oxygen equilibrium studies of human hemoglobin (19Coletta M. Angeletti M. Ascenzi P. Bertollini A. Della Longa S., De Sanctis G. Priori A.M. Santucci R. Amiconi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6865-6874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Tsuneshige A. Park S. Yonetani T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) showing that the addition of BZF to stripped hemoglobin lowers the oxygen affinity of R-state hemoglobin by a factor of 8–10 at pH 7.0. We found a novel allosteric binding site of R-state horse hemoglobin for BZF. Our data disclose a new inhibitory mechanism by BZF, namely, directly interacting with the heme and the helices E and F in the α subunit and thereby narrowing the ligand binding pocket without altering the R quaternary structure. Most of the other mechanisms of allosteric inhibition by heterotropic effectors involve the formation of intersubunit hydrogen bonds or van der Waals contacts that specifically stabilize and constrain the T quaternary structure. In contrast, our observed binding site is near the surface of each α subunit in the R quaternary structure. Furthermore, these findings combined with previous observations of the deoxyhemoglobin-BZF complex allow us to conclude that BZF is a novel multifunctional allosteric effector that interacts with not only hemoglobin in the T-state but also in the R-state, utilizing distinct binding sites."

Neutrophils provide the first line of defense against microorganisms (1Dinauer M. Nathan D. Orkin S. Hematology of Infancy and Childhood. W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1998: 890-949Google Scholar). In response to infection, they adhere to endothelial surfaces at the site of inflammation, move across the endothelial barrier, and migrate to the site of microbial invasion. Properly opsonized microorganisms are ingested by neutrophils. During phagocytosis, there is activation of the respiratory burst and fusion of specific and azurophilic granules releasing both toxic oxygen metabolites and granule contents into the developing phagolysosome. The microbe is destroyed by a variety of oxygen-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Production of oxygen metabolites is critical to the function of the neutrophil. The respiratory burst is initiated by the NADPH oxidase, an enzyme system with several components (2Ambruso D.R. Johnston R.J. Chernick V. Boat T.F. Disorders of the Respiratory Tract in Children. W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1998: 1107-1117Google Scholar). In the unstimulated cell, the oxidase is dormant with components occupying different compartments within the neutrophil. Membrane-bound constituents of cytochromeb 558, the gp91phox and p22phox, reside in the plasma membrane and membrane of the specific granules (3Parkos C.A. Allen R.A. Cochrane C.G. Jesaitis A.J. J.

Upon stimulation of the neutrophil, cytosolic components translocate to the plasma membrane resulting in assembly of the oxidase complex and expression of enzyme activity (3Parkos C.A. Allen R.A.

In this disorder, abnormalities in gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, or p67phox result in failure to assemble an active complex, deficient production of O 2⨪, diminished bactericidal activity, and a predisposition to severe, life threatening bacterial and fungal infections. Recently, a mutation in Rac2 has been reported with deficient O 2⨪ production in response to specific stimuli and decreased bactericidal activity (8Ambruso D.R. Knall C. Abell A.N. Panepinto J.

Over the past 15 years, great progress has been made in defining the structural components of the oxidase as well as the role each plays in the function of this enzyme system. The requirement for Rac, p47phox, p67phox, gp91phox, and p22phoxhas been demonstrated by a variety of studies with intact neutrophils and cell-free systems activated by anionic detergents (9Bromberg Y.

In the cytosol, p47phoxinteracts with p67phox and is required for translocation of p67phox (16DeLeo F.R. Quinn M.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677-691Google Scholar). Discovered by its binding to p67phox, the p40phox also translocates to the plasma membrane. However, the exact role of the p40phox is not known, and it is not necessary for O 2⨪ production in cell-free systems (17Wientjes F.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem.

This 29-kDa protein was first detected in immunoprecipitation studies suggesting an interaction with p67phox in cytosol. Binding of the p29 protein to p67phox was confirmed with a yeast two-hybrid system. Expression of human recombinant protein (rh-p29) in Sf9 cells and purification of the protein demonstrated PLA2 activity similar to an identical protein isolated from rat lung (19Kim T.S. Sundaresh C.S. Feinstein S.I. Dodia C. Skach W.R. Jain M.K. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2542-2550Google Scholar). The rh-p29 also had peroxidase activity and sequence homology classifying it as a peroxiredoxin. Finally, in the SDS cell-free system of oxidase activation, rh-p29 enhanced O2consumption and O 2⨪ production suggesting that it may play a critical role in regulating toxic oxygen metabolites and, perhaps, protecting the oxidase complex from oxidative damage. Bovine serum albumin, horseradish peroxidase, o-phenylaminediamine, H2O2, dimethyl pimelimidate, SDS, DTT, Tween 20, urea, bee venom PLA2, catalase, guanidium, chloroform, phenol, and p-bromophenacyl bromide were purchased from Sigma. Immunopure immobilized protein G on 6% beaded agarose and an immunopure (G) IgG purification kit were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). NBD PC and NBD PE were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Pelham, AL). Silver nitrate staining was completed with a kit from Accurate Chemical and Scientific Co. (Westbury, NY). Recombinant p67phox, p47phox, constitutively active Rac1, RacQ61L, and an anti-p67phox goat polyclonal IgG were prepared as previously described (8Ambruso D.R. Knall C. Abell A.N. Panepinto J.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 271-276Google Scholar). Amino acids and cofactors used in yeast two-hybrid minimal medium were purchased from Sigma. pEG202, pJG4-5, pSH18-34, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae EGY48 were gifts of Erica Golemis and Roger Brent (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Fox Chase, PA, and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-p40phox IgG serum was kindly provided by Professor A. Segal (17Wientjes F.B. Hsuan J.J. Totty N.F. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557-561Google Scholar) and polyclonal rabbit antiserum, B1, was provided by Dr. Robert Clark (6Volpp B.D. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1295-1297Google Scholar). Arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and MJ33 was a kind gift from Dr. Chandra Dodia (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Newark, DE). Heparinized (1 units/ml) peripheral blood was obtained from healthy adult volunteers with consent approved by the COMIRB at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. Neutrophils were isolated by standard techniques of dextran sedimentation, Ficoll-hypaque density gradient centrifugation, and hypotonic lysis of red blood cells (20Leavey P.J. Sellins K.S. Thurman G. Elzi D. Hiester A. Silliman C.C. Zerbe G. Cohen J.J. Ambruso D.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 4366-4374Google Scholar). Subcellular fractions of neutrophils were isolated by sucrose density centrifugation after disruption of the cells with nitrogen cavitation in the presence of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (1 mm), leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mm) as previously described (20Leavey P.J. Sellins K.S. Thurman G. Elzi D. Hiester A. Silliman C.C. Zerbe G. Cohen J.J. Ambruso D.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 4366-4374Google Scholar). Cytosol and plasma membrane fractions frozen immediately after preparation at −70 °C were used in subsequent studies. IgG was immunopurified from goat p67phoxantiserum by column chromatography using Immunopure-immobilized protein G on 6% beaded agarose and an Immunopure (G) IgG purification kit. This yielded high concentrations of purified IgG as determined by Coomassie staining of the preparations after SDS-PAGE. The polyclonal antibody was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (4 mmNaH2PO4·H2O, 16 mmNa2HPO4, 0.154 m NaCl, pH 7.4) and stored at −70 °C until needed. This antibody was bound to agarose beads as follows. Purified anti-p67phox IgG, at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, was mixed with immobilized protein G on 6% beaded agarose in binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The suspension was centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 5 min and the supernatant was removed. After washing twice with 0.2 m sodium borate (pH 9.0), the beads were then resuspended in 0.2 m sodium borate (pH 9.0) with 20 mm dimethyl pimelimidate and allowed to mix for 30 min at room temperature. The preparation was then spun at 3000 ×g for 5 min, and the beads were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and used immediately. For Western blotting, cytosol, cytosol fractions, purified proteins, or recombinant proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies to p67phox, p47phox, and p40phox; antiserum to a peptide containing the first 15 amino acids of the p29 (described below); antibody to the 5-kDa recognition (Xpress) sequence expressed by the recombinant p29; or the original rabbit antiserum (B1) to p47phox and p67phox as previously described (6Volpp B.D. Nauseef W.M. Clark R.A. Science. 1988; 242: 1295-1297Google Scholar). Analysis was completed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody,o-phenylaminediamine as a substrate, and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences) as described (20Leavey P.J. Sellins K.S. Thurman G. Elzi D. Hiester A. Silliman C.C. Zerbe G. Cohen J.J. Ambruso D.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 4366-4374Google Scholar). Cytosol from unstimulated neutrophils was prepared as noted above at a concentration of 2 × 108 cell equivalents/ml. To 2 ml of cytosol, which had been precleared by incubation with protein G-agarose beads, was added anti-p67phox-coated beads (2 ml) prepared as described above. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the beads were washed, resuspended to the original volume in SDS sample buffer, and heated at 56 °C for 1 h. Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and stained with Coomassie stain. The band of interest at 29 kDa was removed, nitrocellulose destained, and N-terminal sequencing, based on Edman chemistry, was performed directly from the membrane using a PROCISE protein sequencer (ABI 492, Applied Biosystems) (22Fruton J.S. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 39: 189-194Google Scholar). The results provided a 17-amino acid sequence from the N-terminal portion of p29. This procedure was repeated a second time with identical results. The eluate from the immunoaffinity column was analyzed with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE in one dimension and isoelectric focusing in the second. Only one protein spot was identified in the molecular weight range of 28,000–30,000 (data not shown). The sequence was identical to that of an open reading frame protein obtained from a leukemia cell line (23Nagase T. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Sazuka T. Seki N. Sato S. Tabata S. Ishikawa K. Kawarabayasi Y. Kotani H. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 37-43Google Scholar) and a protein with PLA2 activity subsequently purified from rat lung (19Kim T.S. Sundaresh C.S. Feinstein S.I. Dodia C. Skach W.R. Jain M.K. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. Fisher A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2542-2550Google Scholar). A 15-amino acid peptide with the identical sequence was synthesized by 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl chemistry in a peptide synthesizer (Macromolecular Resources, Ft. Collins, CO) and used to raise an antibody in rabbits. The preimmune serum showed no reactivity with the peptide on Western blot analysis, whereas the immune serum exhibited reactivity to both the peptide and the 29-kDa protein in cytosol (data not shown). Total cellular RNA was extracted from neutrophils by the guanidine isothiocyanate method with a single step acid extraction procedure (8Ambruso D.R. Knall C. Abell A.N. Panepinto J. Kurkchubasche A. Thurman G. Gonzalez-Aller C. Hiester A. deBoer M. Harbeck R.J. Oyer R. Johnson G.L. Roos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4654-4659Google Scholar, 24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed with a PerkinElmer DNA Thermal cycler 480 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the following oligonucleotide probes: sense 5′-CATCACCGTCGCCATG, and antisense 5′-CACAGCACCAACTTCTC. The reverse transcription reaction included 1 μg of RNA, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm each dNTPs, 1 unit/μl of RNase inhibitor, 2.5 unit/μl of reverse transcriptase, and 2.5 μm oligo(dT)16 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reverse transcriptase reaction was completed as follows: 42 °C, 15 min; 99 °C, 5 min; 5 °C, 5 min. The PCR reaction was followed using 2 mm MgCl2 and 2.5 units/100 μl of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. After 95 °C for 2 min the amplification was followed by 95 °C, 45 s; 59 °C, 45 s; 1 min at 72 °C for 28 cycles. A PCR fragment of 720 bp was amplified and visualized in a 1.5% agarose gel. Six μl of PCR reaction mixture was ligated with 2.5 ng/μl of PCR 2.1 vector using 4 units of T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) at 14 °C overnight into the EcoRI site. From the ligation reaction 2 μl were used for transformation into TOPO-competent cells. Clones were amplified and screened with restriction digests for correct orientation of the 720-bp insert. cDNA was sequenced in each of the clones to check for orientation and was identical to the open reading frame protein (23Nagase T. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Sazuka T. Seki N. Sato S. Tabata S. Ishikawa K. Kawarabayasi Y. Kotani H. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 37-43Google Scholar). The cDNA was subcloned into theEcoRI site of the baculovirus expression vector pBlueBacHis for infection and protein production in Sf9 insect cell (25DeMarzo A.M. Onate S.A. Nordeen S.K. Edwards D.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10491-10501Google Scholar) and into the yeast pEG202 vector for use in the yeast two-hybrid experiments (21Faris S.L. Rinckel L.A. Huang J. Hong Y.R. Kleinberg M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 271-276Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells were grown at 27 °C as previously described (25DeMarzo A.M. Onate S.A. Nordeen S.K. Edwards D.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10491-10501Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in suspension cultures at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and infected with recombinant viruses at an multiplicity of infection of 2.0 for 1 h and then incubated for another 48 h (25DeMarzo A.M. Onate S.A. Nordeen S.K. Edwards D.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10491-10501Google Scholar). Sf9 cells expressing rh-p29 were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml with leupeptin (500 ng/ml), aprotinin (500 ng/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 μg/ml). After seven freeze (ethanol, dry ice) and thaw (37 °C) cycles, the cell lysate was passed through an 18-gauge needle and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The resultant supernatant was applied to a nickel affinity gel (ProBond, Invitrogen) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The beads were washed with aliquots of binding buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8), and then wash buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.0). After each step, the supernatant was removed and the gel was retained for the next step. With completion of washing, the resin was packed into a small column. The recombinant protein was eluted from the column with stepwise additions (1 bed volume) of wash buffer with 50 and 500 mm imidazole. Samples from various fractions were analyzed by separation of proteins on SDS-PAGE and identification of the recombinant protein by Western blot with the various antibodies noted above. The recombinant protein eluted at 500 mm imidazole. Fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl with 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) and stored at −70 °C until used. In specific experiments, recombinant p29 and catalase were denatured by boiling for 2 h or treatment with trichloroacetic acid. Full-length cDNA for p29 was cloned into pEG202 at the C terminus of the LexA DNA binding domain and p47phox and p67phox into pJG4-5 at the C terminus of the B42 transcriptional activation domain as described (21Faris S.L. Rinckel L.A. Huang J. Hong Y.R. Kleinberg M.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 271-276Google Scholar). EGY48 were transformed with plasmids using lithium acetate (26Golemis E. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J.S.J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.14.1-13.14.17Google Scholar). Transformants were tested for two-hybrid interactions between fusion proteins by β-galactosidase activity as described (26Golemis E. Gyuris J. Brent R. Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J.S.J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.14.1-13.14.17Google Scholar). Correct expression of p29/LexA binding domain, p47phox/B42 activation domain, and p67phox/B42 activation domain fusion proteins was verified by immunoblotting yeast cell extracts with appropriate antisera (data not shown). PLA2 activity was measured in a continuous fluorimetric assay using the self-quenching properties of NBD PC and NBD PE (27Blanchard S.G. Harris C.O. Parks D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 435-440Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of the NBD phospholipids at the sn-2 position leads to an increase in fluorescence that can be used to determine the initial rate of hydrolysis of the substrate and consequently the PLA2 activity (27Blanchard S.G. Harris C.O. Parks D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 435-440Google Scholar). NBD PC or NBD PE (final concentration of 3.5 mm) in a 2-ml reaction volume containing buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 7.4 or 4.0) with or without 2.0 mm calcium chloride was incubated in a PerkinElmer LS-5B fluorimeter, equipped with a thermostat and stirring device. Under these conditions, a low fluorescence was recorded (F min) because of the self-quenching properties of the NBD PC or PE. Addition of 30 μl of 0.1 IU/ml of bee venom PLA2 lead to rapid hydrolysis of all NBD PE or NBD PC and an increase in fluorescence to a maximal value (F max). The difference in fluorescence (F max − F min) was linearly related to the concentration of NBD PC or PE in the buffer and was kept constant in all assays. The initial rate of hydrolysis was linearly related to the amount of bee venom PLA2 added (not shown), confirming reported results (27Blanchard S.G. Harris C.O. Parks D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 435-440Google Scholar). To determine the PLA2 activity of our protein, various concentrations of rh-p29 in 50 μl of buffer were added to the substrate mixture and the fluorescence was recorded continuously for 10 min. Peroxiredoxin activity was measured in two ways. In the first, the activity was determined as protection of glutamine synthetase activity from inactivation by a H2O2 generating system containing ferric chloride and DTT as previously described (28Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Google Scholar). Varying amounts of rh-p29, catalase, or heat-inactivated proteins were added to a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 5 μmFeCl3·6H2O, 20 mm DTT, and 0.5 μg of glutamine synthetase in 0.05 m Hepes (pH 7.0). After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, 100 μl of a solution containing 0.4 mm ADP, 0.4 mmMnCl2, 10 mm potassium arsenate, 20 mm hydroxylamine, and 100 mm glutamine was added to the initial reaction and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 50 μl of a solution containing 55 mg of FeCl3·6H2O, 20 mg of trichloroacetic acid, and 21 μl of HCl/ml. After centrifugation for 30 s at 10,000 × g, 150 μl of supernatant was added to wells of a microtiter plate and optical density at 550 nm was determined. Protection afforded by rh-p29, catalase, or denatured proteins was determined by the following equation. %Protection=100×(activity GS+Fe/DTT+protectant)−(activity GS+Fe/DTT)(Activity GS)−(activity GS+Fe/DTT)(Eq. 1) In the second method, the removal of H2O2 was directly measured (29Thurman R.G. Ley H.G. Scholz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 420-430Google Scholar). In this assay, contaminating iron was removed from water and Hepes buffer with Chelex chromatography (30McDermott J.A. Huber C.T. Osaki S. Frieden E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 151: 541-557Google Scholar). A standard amount of H2O2was generated by addition of DTT and H2O2. DTT (2 mm), H2O2 (12 nmol), and various concentrations of rh-p29, catalase, or denatured proteins in a volume of 100 μl were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Then, 20 μl of 1n HCl, 20 μl of 10 mmFe(NH4)SO4, and 10 μl of 2.5 mpotassium thiocyanate were added. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 s and 100 μl of the supernatant was added to wells of a microtiter plate and the optical density was measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 450 nm. The amount of H2O2 remaining in the reaction was determined by comparison with a standard curve. Peroxiredoxin activity was calculated as % of H2O2 removed, based on the ratio of the amount of H2O2 generated in the presence and absence of added proteins.%H2O2=H2O2presence of proteinH2O2absence of protein×100(Eq. 2) The generation of O 2⨪ by a cell-free NADPH oxidase system was performed as previously described (8Ambruso D.R. Knall C. Abell A.N. Panepinto J. Kurkchubasche A. Thurman G. Gonzalez-Aller C. Hiester A. deBoer M. Harbeck R.J. Oyer R. Johnson G.L. Roos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4654-4659Google Scholar). To a reaction mixture (final volume, 150 μl) was added 1 μg of plasma membrane, 150 pmol of recombinant Rac1, 9 pmol of recombinant p67phox, 12 pmol of p47phox, 10 μm GTPγS, 112.5 μmSDS, and 75 μm cytochrome c. The reaction was initiated with addition of 200 μm NADPH and O 2⨪was determined as superoxide dismutase inhibitable cytochromec reduction in microtiter plates using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at 550 nm. O 2⨪ production was calculated as previously described (8Ambruso D.R. Knall C. Abell A.N. Panepinto J. Kurkchubasche A. Thurman G. Gonzalez-Aller C. Hiester A. deBoer M. Harbeck R.J. Oyer R. Johnson G.L. Roos D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4654-4659Google Scholar). O2 consumption was determined using a Clark polarographic oxygen electrode (YSI Co., Yellow Springs, OH). The reactants of the cell-free oxidase system described above were added to a closed reaction vessel (300 μl). Activity was initiated with addition of NADPH, the rate of O2 consumption was measured over 10 min, and the results expressed as nanomole/min as previously described (5Ambruso D.R. Bolscher B.G. Stokman P.M. Verhoeven A.J. Roos D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 924-930Google Scholar, 31Rosenthal J. Thurman G.W. Cusack N. Peterson V.M. Malech H.L. Ambruso D.R. Blood. 1996; 88: 4321-4329Google Scholar). Statistical evaluation of results was completed using Student's t test or paired ttest. During initial studies designed to quantitate phox components in cytosol using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique with a polyclonal antibody to capture p67phox and a monoclonal antibody to detect it, we were unable to completely recover recombinant p67phox added to cytosol (32Leavey P.J. Gonzalez-Aller C. Thurman G. Kleinberg M.E. Rinckel L.A. Ambruso D.R. Blood. 1998; 92: 498aGoogle Scholar). These results were repeated with cytosol from p47phox- and p67phox-deficient patients as well as cytosol made deficient of p40phox by immunoprecipitation and suggested the presence of inhibitory factor(s) distinct from known phox proteins that prevented binding to the detecting (monoclonal) antibody. To further explore this possibility, immunoprecipitation of p67phox was completed with goat polyclonal"
https://openalex.org/W1515210503,"The La protein was recently identified as a host factor potentially involved in the cytokine-induced post-transcriptional down-regulation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA. The La binding site was mapped to a predicted stem-loop structure within a region shared by all HBV RNAs, and it was concluded that the La protein might be an HBV RNA-stabilizing factor. To characterize the RNA binding mediated by the different RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) of the human La protein, several La deletion mutants were produced and analyzed for HBV RNA binding ability. The data demonstrate that the first RRM is not required for binding, whereas the RNP-1 and RNP-2 consensus sequences of the RRM-2 and RRM-3 are separately required for binding, indicating a cooperative function of these two RRMs. Furthermore, the results suggest that multimeric La disassembles into monomeric La upon binding of HBV RNA.B. By gel retardation assay the affinity of the wild type human La·HBV RNA.B interaction was determined in the nanomolar range, comparable to the affinity determined for the mouse La·HBV RNA.B interaction. This study identified small regions within the human La protein mediating the binding of HBV RNA. Hence, these binding sites might represent targets for novel antiviral strategies based on the disruption of the human La·HBV RNA interaction, thereby leading to HBV RNA degradation.

The human La protein is a 47-kDa phosphoprotein predominantly localized in the nucleus. It was first discovered as an autoantigen recognized by antibodies present in sera of patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome (1Mattioli M. Reichlin M.

Among the different La proteins identified in a variety of organisms, the N-terminal part is highly conserved (9Maraia R.J. Intine R.V. Mol. Cell.

At this time point it is not clear yet how La fulfills all of these different functions, however, assuming that this protein acts as a RNA chaperone, thereby stabilizing RNA structures, a function in these varied processes might be envisaged. The human La protein contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRM) involved in the binding of RNAs (9Maraia R.J. Intine R.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), although the RRMs do not match very well to the RRM core structure identified by comparison of 70 known RRMs (7Birney E. Kumar S. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The RNA recognition motif is one of the best characterized RNA binding motifs present as single or as multiple copies in a multitude of RNA-binding proteins. The three-dimensional structure was resolved for some RRMs, and the secondary structural elements composing the three-dimensional structure are β1α1β2β3α2β4 folding (32Wittekind M. Gorlach M. Friedrichs M. Dreyfuss G. Mueller L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6254-6265Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 33Nagai K. Oubridge C. Jessen T.H., Li, J. Evans P.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Two conserved amino acid signatures referred to as RNP-1 and RNP-2 (RNP consensus sequence) are described as essential motifs for RNA binding. Maraia and coworkers established a model for the interaction of La with pre-tRNA (9Maraia R.J. Intine R.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this model the N-terminal RRM interacts with the 3′-end of pre-tRNA by binding to the poly-U stretch, the second and third RRM interacts with the pre-tRNA molecule, and the C-terminal part of La binds the 5′-end of the pre-tRNA (9Maraia R.J. Intine R.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This C-terminal region contains a basic amino acid stretch and a Walker-A motif (34Topfer F. Gordon T. McCluskey J. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3091-3100PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ohndorf U.M. Steegborn C. Knijff R. Sondermann P. J. Biol.

After complete processing of tRNA, La is unable to interact with mature tRNA, signifying that the 5′- and 3′-ends of the pre-tRNA are essential for the recognition by La.

Immunol. 2001; 19: 65-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) have shown that injection of hepatitis B virus surface antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes into HBV transgenic mice led to suppression of all viral products by an non-cytotoxic pathway. This as of yet unresolved process was mediated by the cytokines interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α. Furthermore, it was shown that these cytokines lead to post-transcriptional degradation of the viral RNA (43Tsui L.V. Guidotti L.G. Ishikawa T. Chisari F.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12398-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify host factors involved in degradation of the viral RNA, the mouse La protein (mLa) was identified as an HBV RNA-specific binding protein. A strong correlation between the cytokine-mediated disappearance of HBV RNA and the cytokine-induced processing of full-length mLa was observed, indicating that full-length mLa is involved in stabilizing HBV RNA (22Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Cavanaugh V.J. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 474-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5767-5776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding site of mLa was mapped to a predicted stem-loop structure within an element 91 nucleotides long (referred to as HBV RNA.B) located at the 5′-end of the post-transcriptional regulatory element of HBV, and the specificity of the interaction was confirmed by competition experiments using a variety of competitors (22Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Cavanaugh V.J. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 474-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5767-5776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the affinity of the interaction was determined in the nanomolar range, further indicating a specific mLa·HBV RNA.B interaction (23Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5767-5776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The idea that this viral RNA element might represent a stabilizing element was further supported by a recent publication showing that the viral RNA was accessible to endoribonucleolytic cleavage near the mLa binding site (31Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6874-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The endoribonucleolytic activity present in nuclear extracts of HBV transgenic mice was characterized, and it was shown that the HBV RNA substrates were more efficiently cleaved after induction of HBV RNA degradation and mLa processing. These data imply that the mLa protein is involved in the HBV RNA metabolism. To gain better insight into the role of human La protein (hLa) in the viral RNA metabolism, we characterized the hLa·HBV RNA interaction in more detail. We evaluated the optimal conditions for the interaction between recombinant hLa protein and in vitro transcribed HBV RNA.B and determined the binding affinity. Our results indicate that multimeric hLa disassembles into monomers upon binding of HBV RNA.B. Furthermore, we investigated the requirement of each of the three RRMs for binding by deleting the whole RRM-1 and the RNP-2 and RNP-1 motifs located in the second and third RRM. Deletion of short amino acid stretches gives us the ability to discover a cooperative binding mechanism between RRM-2 and RRM-3 and reduces the possibility of major structural changes triggered by this kind of manipulation. Our study shows that HBV RNA.B is bound by the RNP-2 motifs of RRM-2 and RRM-3, suggesting an interplay goes on between those two RRMs. We identified short amino acid stretches that might be useful as targets for specific disruption of the hLa·HBV RNA interaction to destabilize the viral RNA. A plasmid containing the hLa sequence cloned into the pET28b(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI) encoding the hLa sequence under the control of a isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 promotor with an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag was a kind gift of E. Chan (The Scripps Research Institute). Mutations were introduced into the hLa coding sequence by PCR according to the site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using proofreadingPwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). To introduce the different mutations the following oligonucleotides were used: for mutant hLa-Δ1, sense primer M39 (5′-GTG ACT GAT GAG TAT AAA AAT G-3′) and antisense primer M40 (5′-CAT CTT TTC ATT ATC ACC-3′); for mutant hLa-Δ2, sense primer M26 (5′-CCA ACT GAT GCA ACT CTT G-3′) and antisense primer M27 (5′-AGA TCT GTT TTT TAC ATC-3′); for mutant hLa-Δ3, sense primer M28 (5′-GAT AGC ATT GAA GCT GCT AAG-3′) and antisense primer M29 (5′-AAA TGC TTT ATG CAA TGT TC-3′), where primer M28 contained a point mutation leading to amino acid substitution S163A. For mutant hLa-Δ4, sense primer M22 (5′-GAT GAT CAG ACC TGT AGA G-3′) and antisense primer M23 (5′-CAG CAA GCA TCC AAT CTT TTC-3′); for mutant hLa-Δ5, sense primer M24 (5′-AAA GAA AAA GCC AAG GAA GC-3′) and antisense primer M25 (5′-TCC TCT GAC GAA GTC TAT CC-3′); for mutant hLa-Δ6, sense primer M30 (5′-GTA CAG TTT CAG GGC AAG-3′) and antisense primer M35 (5′-AAT TAT CCC CTC TTT TGC-3′); for mutant hLa-Δ7, sense primer M41 (5′-CCT GCA TCC AAA CAA CAG-3′) and the antisense primer M36 (5′-TTT ACC AGA CCC AGG CTG-3′). PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germany), phosphorylated at the 5′-end with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany), subsequently ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in an appropriate volume of H2O. The PCR products were ligated with the Rapid DNA Ligation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the ligated DNA was digested with 10 units of DpnI enzyme (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) for 1 h at 37 °C with appropriate buffers and transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5α. The introduced mutations were checked by sequencing using the Licor 4000L system (MWG Biotech, Germany). Recombinant proteins were expressed in 100 ml ofE. coli BL21 cultures containing the appropriate antibiotic. 100 ml of bacteria cultures was grown at 37 °C to a density of A 600 = 0.5, treated with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm, and shaken for additional 4–5 h at 37 °C. The cells were subsequently precipitated by centrifugation. All purification steps were carried out with chilled buffers at 4 °C, and all solutions contained 1% protease inhibitor mix Complete (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). Cells were lysed in 2 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl and sonicated three times for 10 s. His-tagged hLa protein was purified with Ni-NTA Spin columns (Qiagen, Germany) as follows. The cell lysate was recovered by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Before loading, the Ni-NTA spin columns were equilibrated with 600 μl of lysis buffer by centrifugation at 700 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the soluble proteins was loaded onto the spin columns and centrifuged for 2 min at 700 × g. Nonspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing the column four times each with 600 μl of wash buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, 42.5 mm imidazole, 1 m NaCl, 0.11% Triton X-100). The His-tagged hLa protein was eluted with 3 × 200 μl elution buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl). For large scale hLa preparations, 1 liter of bacteria solution was treated as above, and the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C with 20,000 × g. The supernatant was then incubated with 5–8 ml of equilibrated Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Germany) for 30–60 min with gentle stirring at 4 °C and loaded to a 1.5- × 15-cm column. Nonspecifically bound proteins were removed with 50 ml of wash buffer and His-tagged hLa was eluted with elution buffer in 1-ml fractions. Eluted hLa was dialyzed three times against 500 ml of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol). When higher protein concentrations were desired, the protein solution was concentrated with Amicon Centricon YM-10 concentrators (Millipore, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Germany). Correct size and purity of the expressed and purified recombinant hLa were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE minigels using the MiniProtean-III System (Bio-Rad, Germany) followed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis (see Fig. 5 below). The latter was achieved according to standard methods, briefly, by electrotransfer (90 min, 4 °C, 65 V) to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher & Schüll, Germany) in a wet-blot system using the Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad, Germany) and immunoblotting with primary mouse monoclonal αhLa antibodies 3B9, 4B6, SW5 (M. Bachmann, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, OK) or rabbit polyclonal α-hLa antibody 1982 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary goat-anti-mouse IgG antibody (H+L) or goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibody (H+L) (Dianova, Germany), respectively. Visualization of immunodetected proteins was achieved with the SuperSignal chemiluminescent peroxidase solution system (Pierce, Rockford, IL), followed by x-ray film development. To verify the results, at least two to three different protein preparations were tested that gave similar results. As a further step of protein purification, we performed preparative gel filtration analysis using a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S100-HR column (Amersham Bioscience, Germany), which had been equilibrated with buffer A (see above). To maintain constant flow rates of 0.5 ml/min and for sensitive detection of eluted protein by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm, the column was connected to a high-performance liquid chromatography BioCad Sprint System (PerSeptive Biosystems Inc./Applied Biosystems, Germany) using the BioCad Perfusion Chromatography Workstation software (version 3.00), including an external fraction collector. To establish a calibration curve for the column, the void volume was determined using 1 mg of dextran (M r 2,000,000, Sigma, Germany). Furthermore, 1 mg each of alcohol dehydrogenase (M r 150,000), albumin (M r 66,000), ovalbumin (M r 42,700), and carbonic anhydrase (M r 29,000) were loaded separately, and the elution volume for each protein was detected. A standard curve was obtained for all calibration proteins with the y-axis showing the log of molecular weight and the x-axis showingK av, where K av is calculated as K av = (V e− V 0)/(V t −V o), where V t is bed volume of the column, V o is void volume, andV e is elution volume. For protein purification at least 1 mg of Ni-NTA-purified His-tagged hLa protein in a volume of 1–2 ml was loaded to the equilibrated column, the elution volume of the different peaks was determined and compared with those of the standard proteins thereby calculating the K avand molecular weight of each peak. Characterization of the oligomerization of WT hLa protein and of the synthesized mutants was performed by gel filtration analysis using an analytical Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Bioscience, Germany). This column was connected to the same high-performance liquid chromatography-system as mentioned above and calibrated with the same proteins (0.2 mg each, loaded separately) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The buffer used corresponded to buffer A but contained 10 mm EDTA to prevent cation-dependent oligomerization of His-tagged recombinant hLa. For analysis of hLa proteins 0.05 mg of Ni-NTA-purified His-tagged hLA protein in a volume of 0.5 ml was loaded to the equilibrated column. The elution volume was determined, K av was calculated, and the molecular weight was then derived from the standard curve of this column. The in vitro transcript HBV RNA.B was generated by in vitro transcription as previously described (22Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Cavanaugh V.J. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 474-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5767-5776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For competition experiments, actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA were produced as described elsewhere (23Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5767-5776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An FspI-linearized plasmid (phTR1) containing the human telomerase RNA coding sequence (kindly provided by W. Filipowicz) was used for the generation of human telomerase competitor RNAs by in vitro transcription. The standard binding reaction was carried out in a final volume of 40 μl with 200 ng or, as indicated, Ni-NTA spin columns or, if indicated, preparative gel filtration-purified (Peak-2, 85–90 kDa) recombinant hLa protein and about 200,000 cpm or molar concentrations, as indicated, of32P-radiolabeled HBV RNA.B in binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (unless otherwise stated). The in vitro transcribed32P-labeled RNA.B was denatured at 75 °C for 10 min and renatured by cooling slowly to RT prior to addition to the reaction mixture. Samples were incubated for 10 min at RT. After addition of 5 μl of electrophoresis buffer containing 10% glycerol and 0.01% bromphenol blue, reaction mixtures were separated on an 8% native polyacrylamide gel (18 × 18 cm) for 3–4 h at 200 V at room temperature. The gels were prerun at 240 V for 1 h in 1 × TBE containing 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA. Gels were dried for 1.5 h at 80 °C on Whatman paper (Whatman, UK) using a Bio-Rad Slab Dryer Model 483 (Bio-Rad, Germany), and signals were evaluated using a FUJIX BAS 2000 phosphorimaging system (Fuji, Germany) or documented via exposure to x-ray films. All EMSAs with wild type and deletion mutants of hLa protein were performed at least three to five times with at least two different protein preparations, and similar results were obtained in all cases. For saturation experiments and calculation of dissociation constants (K D), increasing amounts of protein were added to constant amounts of RNA as indicated in the figures. The signal intensity of the hLa·RNA complexes was quantified using TINA2.09d software provided by the supplier (Raytest, Germany). The band intensities of monomeric hLa·RNA complexes were measured, background intensities were subtracted, and the values were transformed to relative ratios calculated as a percentage of maximum signal, and data were fitted to non-linear regression curves. Data were expressed as the mean out of five independent experiments. For supershift analysis, 200 ng of Ni-NTA-purified hLa was preincubated with 5 μl of antibody (as indicated in the figures) and 20 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI) in a 20-μl volume of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 1 h, before the other components of the standard reaction and the labeled RNA were added. Competition experiments were carried out by addition of excess cold competitor to the binding reaction 3 min before the addition of the labeled transcript. To study the interaction between hLa and HBV RNA.B, an RNA gel retardation assay was established using recombinant hLa and in vitrotranscribed HBV RNA.B as interaction partners. In the first experiments, we tested whether the specificity and the binding conditions for the complex formation between recombinant hLa and HBVin vitro transcribed RNA.B were similar to the previously shown specific interaction and optimized binding conditions between HBV RNA.B and endogenous mLa prepared from HBV transgenic mice livers and HBV RNA.B. The recombinant hLa protein used in this study was fused to a hexa-histidine tag, expressed in E. coli, and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography or gel filtration as indicated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” HBV RNA.B was synthesized by in vitro transcription using [32P]UTP for uniform labeling of the transcript. Incubation of recombinant hLa with labeled HBV RNA.B leads to the formation of hLa·RNA.B complexes with different electrophoretic mobility as shown by RNA gel retardation assays (Fig.1 A, lane 2). The signal intensities of these hLa·RNA.B complexes varied between different experiments, but the complex with the highest mobility (Fig.1 A, hLa monomer) was consistently predominant, suggesting a preferential formation of this complex. To confirm that these complexes were formed between hLa and HBV RNA.B, a supershift analysis was performed using two La-specific antibodies. The monoclonal antibody SW5 and the polyclonal rabbit anti-hLa serum shifted all of the hLa·HBV RNA.B complexes (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 versus 3 and 4), whereas the rabbit pre-immune serum had no effect on complex formation or on complex mobility (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2 versus 5). These results show that hLa forms RNA-binding competent multimers, although the hLa·HBV RNA.B complex with the highest mobility, referred to as monomer, was the most prominent one, and the formation of higher molecular weight complexes varied from experiment to experiment as seen in this study. Next we asked whether recombinant hLa binds HBV RNA.B as specific as it was shown recently for the interaction between endogenous mLa present in nuclear protein extracts of HBV transgenic mice and HBV RNA.B (22Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Cavanaugh V.J. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 474-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,23Heise T. Guidotti L.G. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5767-5776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

In trypanosomatid protozoa all mRNAs carry at their 5′-end a common spliced leader sequence (SL) 1The abbreviations used are: SL, spliced leader; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; m7G, 7-methylguanosine; nt, nucleotides. 1The abbreviations used are: SL, spliced leader; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; m7G, 7-methylguanosine; nt, nucleotides. that is acquired bytrans-splicing, a bimolecular splicing reaction involving a small capped RNA, the SL RNA, and the pre-mRNA (1Agabian N.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2621-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), nematodes (3Krause M. Hirsh D. Cell. 1987; 49: 753-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), trematodes (4Rajkovic A. Davis R.E. Simonsen J.N. Rottman F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and more recently in chordates (5Vandenberghe A.E. Meedel T.H. Hastings K.E. Gene Dev. 2001; 15: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The SL RNA of all organisms has two domains, namely the SL sequence or exon, which in trypanosomatid protozoa is 39–41 nt long, followed by the intron of variable length, and can be folded into a conserved secondary structure with three stem-loops (see Fig. 1). The first stem-loop encompasses part of the SL sequence just upstream from the 5′-splice site, whereas the intron has the potential to be folded into two stem-loops separated by a single-stranded region. This latter region, also known as the Sm-like site, contains the binding site for the core proteins of the SL ribonucleoprotein particle (SL RNP) and is analogous to the Sm site of snRNAs in higher eukaryotes and yeast. Despite the evolutionary conservation of the SL RNA secondary structure, the SL RNA sequence is not conserved among the different groups of organisms listed above. However, within trypanosomatid protozoa, as well within nematodes and trematodes, the exon sequence shows a considerable degree of conservation at the primary sequence level (6Bruzik J.P. Van Doren K. Hirsh D. Steitz J.A. Nature. 1988; 335: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). One distinguishing feature of SL RNAs of trypanosomatid protozoa is the presence of a hypermethylated cap with the structure 7-methylguanosine-ppp-N6,N6,2′-O-trimethyladenosine-p-2′-O-methyladenosine-p-2′-O-methylcytosine-p-N3,2′-O-dimethyluridine (7Perry K.L. Watkins K.P. Agabian N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8190-8194Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). By convention this cap structure is referred to as a cap 4, because four nucleotides after the m7G moiety are modified. Recently, Mair et al. (8Mair G. Ullu E. Tschudi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28994-28999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have shown that inTrypanosoma brucei permeable cells cap 4 formation occurs cotranscriptionally. These studies demonstrated that m7G capping was present on transcripts as short as 56 nt, and that subsequent modifications of the cap 4 nucleotides were added successively in a 5′ to 3′ direction. Short transcripts terminated before the Sm-like site were already modified at the A residues at positions 1 and 2 and partially modified at the C residue at position 3, but modification of the U residue at position 4 was only gained when transcripts reached position 117 or beyond; namely when the synthesis of the Sm-like site had been completed. Only transcripts containing the Sm-like site were associated with the core proteins of the SL RNP (8Mair G. Ullu E. Tschudi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28994-28999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In vitro studies in extracts of the nematode Ascaris suum were conclusive in identifying one functional role of the SL sequence, namely a transcriptional role. The exon sequence contains transcription signals and a binding site for a putative transcription factor (9Maroney P.A. Hannon G.J. Denker J.A. Nilsen T.W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3667-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of all but two nucleotides of the SL exon did not affect trans-splicing in vitro (10Hannon G.J. Maroney P.A. Denker J.A. Nilsen T.W. Cell. 1990; 61: 1247-1255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The most crucial sequence for the Ascaris SL RNA function is the Sm site and 3 nt downstream from it. This region base pairs with the U6 snRNA that functions as a bridging molecule to bring the SL RNA to the spliceosome (11Hannon G.J. Maroney P.A., Yu, Y.T. Hannon G.E. Nilsen T.W. Science. 1992; 258: 1775-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast, in trypanosomatid protozoa SL RNA genes do not contain internal promoter elements, and thus the conservation of the exon sequence and of the SL RNA secondary structure is likely to be maintained by constraints imposed on the SL RNP biogenesis and function (12Campbell D.A. Sturm N.R. Yu M.C. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 78-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Sequence and structure conservation may reflect the requirements for binding of core or SL RNA-specific proteins or of the capping machinery that acts during transcription of the SL RNA, and/or for interactions with snRNAs during trans-splicing. In addition, at the mRNA level the SL exon might have post-splicing functions such as nuclear export and/or recognition by the translational apparatus (12Campbell D.A. Sturm N.R. Yu M.C. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 78-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Several studies in the past years have addressed the function of various domains of trypanosomatid SL RNA with regard to transcription,trans-splicing activity, RNP biogenesis, 3′-end processing, and cap 4 synthesis and function. Relevant to the present studies is the fact that using different trypanosomatid model systems no unifying view has emerged with regard to the role in trans-splicing of exon and intron sequences and of cap 4 modifications (Refs. 13Lücke S., Xu, G.L.

In our laboratory we use the Leptomonas collosoma system to examine structural-functional aspects of the SL RNA. For these studies we have constructed a model SL RNA, tagged both in the intron (an insertion of 8 nt in loop II) and in the exon (a G to A substitution at position 31), which is highly expressed and accuratelytrans-spliced (14Goncharov I., Xu, Y.X. Zimmer Y. Sherman K. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2200-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Using this system we have previously analyzed the functional significance of potential base pairing between the SL RNA and the U5 or U6 snRNAs (17Xu Y-X. Liu L. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27883-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All SL RNA mutations in the proposed interaction domain exhibited an altered splicing phenotype, and these results highlighted the importance fortrans-splicing of both exon and intron sequences adjacent to the 5′-splice site (17Xu Y-X. Liu L. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27883-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Compensatory mutations were then introduced in the U5 and U6 snRNAs, to examine whether the splicing defects originated from the failure of the SL RNA to interact with these snRNAs by base-pairing. Suppression was observed only for intron positions +5 and +(7–8) supporting the existence of a base pair interaction of U5 and U6 snRNAs with the SL RNA intron region (17Xu Y-X. Liu L. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27883-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this study we aimed at furthering our understanding of the function of the L. collosoma SL RNA. L. collosoma affords high levels of expression of transgenic SL RNA genes, thus facilitating direct and quantitative analysis of SL RNA function. Importantly, we have previously established a direct assay to evaluate defects affecting SL RNA function during the first step of splicing that is independent from examining the overall utilization of the SL RNA intrans-splicing. Here we have concentrated our mutational analysis on selected exon and intron sequences, on SL RNA domains whose function is controversial, and in particular, on the sequence requirements for cap 4 modification. Our results demonstrate that both exon and intron sequences provide determinants for efficient utilization of the SL RNA in trans-splicing and that there is a tight linkage between the presence of a fully modified cap 4 structure and trans-splicing utilization of the SL RNA. 9825, 5′-GCCCGAAAGCTCGGTC-3′, complementary to positions 80–95 of the SL RNA gene for primer extension of the SL RNA; 34378, 5′-CCCCGTATCATCGATAGACCCCCGC-3′, complementary to −63 to −38 upstream to SL RNA +1 used to clone the PCR product carrying SL RNA mutations; 41328, 5′-CGGGATCCGGACCCCCCAAAGGCCCCCCA-3′ complementary to positions 27–47 located downstream to the SL RNA T run, with theBamHI site underlined, was used to amplify the SL RNA mutants; 43662, 5′-AGAACTAGAGAATTCCGTTCTGGA-3′, complementary to positions 55–70 with the insertion of 8 bases between positions 62 and 63 (SL intron tag); 36815, 5′-GAGGGAGGAATGAGGTGAGC-3′, complementary to neo/hygro mRNA position 4996–5016 on the pX vector); 31227, 5′-CTTCAAAAATTGAGAAGTTAAGAGTCTC-3′, to generate E-1 mutation, complementary to positions −9 to +20 carrying 4 base substitutions TTTT to AGA at positions 4–7; 31226, 5′-CTGTTCTTCAAAATAACTTTTAGTTAAGAGTC-3′, to generate E-2 mutation, complementary to positions (−7 to −25) carrying 4 base substitutions GTTA to TAAC positions 5–8; 31228, 5′-GAAACTGTTCTTCTTGTATTGTTTTAGTTAAG-3′, to generate E-3 mutation, complementary to positions (−3 to −29) carrying 4 base substitutions AAAA to TTGT at positions 13–16; 31224, 5′-AATGAAGTATAGTTTGTGTTCTTCAAAAATTG-3′, to generate E-4 mutation, complementary to positions 9–40 carrying 4 base substitutions AAAC to TTTG and at positions 25–28; 31230, 5′-TACCAATGAAGTGTTTAAACTGTTCTTCAA-3′, to generate E-5 mutation, complementary to positions 18–44 carrying 4 base substitutions ACAG to GTTT at positions 29–32; 31225, 5′-CTACATACCAATGTTAAATAGAAACTGTTCTTC-3′, to generate E-6 mutation, complementary to positions 17–49, carrying 4 base substitutions AAGT to TTAA at positions 33–36; 31107, 5′-ATTGTTTTAGTCAAGAGTCTCTAAC-3′ to generate SL-1 mutation complementary to positions (−13 to −12 with a T to C transition at position +1; 31106, 5′-AATTGTTTTAGCTAAGAGTCTCTAAC-3′, to generate SL-2 mutation, complementary to positions −13 to +13 with a T to C transition at position +2; 39561, 5′-AAATTGTTTTACTTAAGAGTCTCT-3′, to generate SL-3 mutation, complementary to positions (−10 to +14) with a G to C transition at +3; 31109, 5-CAAAAATTGTTTTGGTTAAGAGTCTC-3′ to generate SL-4 mutation complementary to positions −9 to +12 with an A to G transition at +4; 39558, 5′-AAAATTGTTTTTTCCAAGAGTCTCTAACC-3′, to generate the cap 4 mutation complementary to positions −14 to +15 carrying 4 base substitutions UUGA to TTCC at positions 1–4; 40579, 5′-GCCCGAAAGCTCGGTCGAAAATTTCAGA-3′, to generate G79C mutation complementary to positions 68–95; 40578, 5′-GCCCGAAAGCTCGGTGCAAAATTTCAGAG–3′, to generate G80C mutation, complementary to positions 69–95; 40580, 5′-GCCCGAAAGCTCGGAGCAAAATTTCAG-3′, to generate A81U mutation, complementary to positions 69–95; 41203, 5′-GGTCCAAAATTTCGATCCAGAACTAGAGAATT-3′, to generate Sme5′ mutation, complementary to positions 63–83 with CGATC insertion between positions 62 and 63 and carrying 6 bases from the SL tag (AGAATT); 41202, 5′-AAAGCTCGGTCCGGGATTTCAGAACTAGAGAA-3′, to generate U74–78C mutation complementary to positions 63–90 carrying 4 bases from the tag (AGAA) between positions 62 and 63; 31886, 5′-CGAAAGCTCGGTCCGATCCAAAATTTCAGAAC-3′, to generate Sme3′ mutation complementary to positions 66–92 with CGATC insertion between positions 79 and 80; 40581, 5′-GCTCGGTCCAAAATTTCCTCCCTAGAGAATTCCGT-3′, to generate stem II mutation complementary to positions 61–87 with AGAA to CTCC transition between positions 67 and 70; 39562, 5′-AGCCCGAAAGCGTCCTCCAAAATTTCAG-3′, to generate stem III mutation complementary to positions 69–96 carrying TCGG to GTCC transition positions 82 to 85; 25327, 5′-GATCAAAGATTTCGTATTCC-3′, complementary to positions 84–103 of the L. collosoma U2 RNA. L. collosoma cells were grown as described previously (18Xu Y-X. Ben-Shlomo H. Michaeli S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8473-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at log phase, and total RNA was prepared with TRIzol reagent (Sigma) according to the supplier's protocol. Mutations E-1 to E-6 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis as previously described (17Xu Y-X. Liu L. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27883-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mutant SL RNA gene was further subcloned into theSmaI site of pX-neo expression vector. Cell lines were selected on 25 μg/ml G418. The cap 4 and intron mutations were generated by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis using primers carrying the mutations (antisense) and a 5′ primer 34378. The PCR product carrying the mutation (mega primer) was used to amplify the remaining gene using the antisense 3′ primer 41328 and the double SL RNA mutant as a template. The PCR product carrying the mutated SL RNA gene was digested with ClaI (5′-end) and BamHI (3′-end) and cloned into a pX vector carrying the wild-type SL RNA gene that was digested with ClaI (present in the SL RNA gene upstream region) and BamHI (from the vector). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. RNA samples (5 μg) were fractionated on a 10% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea denaturing gel and electroblotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond,Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization with labeled oligonucleotides was performed at 37 °C in 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Primer extension was performed using end-labeled oligonucleotides (100,000 cpm/pmol). After annealing at 60 °C for 15 min, the sample was kept on ice for 1 min. 1 unit of reverse transcriptase (Expand, RT, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 unit of RNase inhibitor (Promega) were added, and extension was performed at 42 °C for 90 min. The reaction was analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel next to DNA sequencing reactions performed with the same primer. The poisoning primer extension used for examining the utilization of mutated SL RNA intrans-splicing was performed as described above, but ddCTP was used instead of dCTP. The reaction was analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. To examine the role of the L. collosoma SL RNA sequences in trans-splicing, we generated a variety of mutant SL RNA genes by introducing block or single nucleotide substitutions or by inserting a limited number of nucleotides in selected regions. All mutations were generated in the context of our model SL RNA gene (G31A) tagged both in the intron (an insertion of 8 nt in loop II) and in the exon (a G to A substitution at position 31) and are shown in Fig. 1 superimposed on the secondary structure model of trypanosomatid SL RNA. The mutated SL RNA genes and flanking regions were subcloned in the episomal pX-neoexpression vector, and the corresponding plasmids were used to establish stable cell lines selected with a high concentration of G418 in order to maximize expression of the transgenes. RNA was isolated from the various cell lines and subjected to the following analyses. 1) Northern blot hybridization to determine the level of expression of wild-type and mutant SL RNA. 2) Primer extension with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′-end of the SL RNA to monitor the extent of accumulation of Y structures. Y structures are formed during the first step of the trans-splicing reaction by joining of the 5′-end of the SL RNA intron to the branch site of pre-mRNA through a 2′-5′ linkage. The 2′-5′ linkage stops the advancement of the reverse transcriptase, thus generating a discrete cDNA product corresponding to the SL RNA intron. This assay monitors defects in the first step of splicing. Primer extension with the same oligonucleotide primer also generates cDNAs corresponding to the full-length SL RNA, and thus allows probing the extent of modification of the SL RNA cap structure. 3) Poisoning primer extension to determine the extent of mature DHFR-neo mRNA carrying the wild-type or mutated SL. As diagrammed in Fig. 4 A, the primer can only hybridize to mature DHFR-neo mRNA, but not to the corresponding pre-mRNA. As previously described (13Lücke S., Xu, G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Goncharov I., Xu, Y.X. Zimmer Y. Sherman K. Michaeli S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2200-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in the presence of ddCTP two primer extension products are produced, a 30-nt-long cDNA corresponding to termination at G31 and diagnostic of wild-type SL exon, and a 36-nt-long cDNA corresponding to termination at G25 of the SL exon and diagnostic of DHFR-neomRNA derived from trans-splicing of mutant SL RNA. Thus, this assay monitors the overall utilization of the mutant SL RNAs intrans-splicing. Previous studies in both L. seymouri and L. tarentolae indicated that mutations encompassing positions 1–4 of the SL RNA, corresponding to the methylated nucleotides of the cap 4 structure, affect modification and trans-splicing utilization of the SL RNA, but the function of the individual nucleotide was not investigated (13Lücke S., Xu, G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Sturm N.R. Fleischmann J. Campbell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18689-18692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To address this question positions 1–4 of the SL RNA were either substituted in block or individual nucleotides were changed one at the time (Fig.1). When all 4 nt were changed (mutant SL-1–4) we could not detect any tagged SL RNA either by Northern blot hybridization (Fig. 2 A) or by primer extension (Fig. 2 B). As compared with our model SL RNA gene (G31A), which produces as much SL RNA as the endogenous SL RNA genes, all the single nucleotide substitutions (SL-1, SL-2, SL-3, and SL-4) resulted in considerably lower levels of accumulation of the corresponding SL RNAs (Fig. 2, A and B and see Fig. 4 C for a quantitation of the relative expression levels). To examine the methylation status of SL RNAs bearing mutations in the cap 4 nucleotides, we performed primer extension using an oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′-end of the SL RNA (Fig.2 B). The primer extension assay detects the methylation status of the cap 4 structure by a series of diagnostic primer extension stops at the 5′-end of the SL RNA that are indicated in Fig.2 B. Under the conditions used for reverse transcription, which employed a high dNTP concentration (0.5 mm), the model G31A SL RNA showed a prominent primer extension stop at position 3 and less pronounced stops at positions 5 and 6 (the identity of the primer extension stops was verified by comparison with a sequencing ladder, data not shown). This pattern was indistinguishable from that of wild-type SL RNA and in L. collosoma is diagnostic of a fully modified cap 4 structure. In contrast, all four cap mutant SL RNAs showed a prominent primer extension stop at position 1, indicating that the corresponding cap 4 structure was undermethylated. Only the SL-1 mutant gave rise to some stops at position 5 and 6 although their intensity was much decreased as compared with the G31A SL RNA. From these results we concluded that substitution of each of the nucleotides at positions 1–4 led to severe alterations of the pattern of modification of the SL cap 4 structure. Similar results were obtained when the dNTP concentration in the reverse transcription reaction was lowered to 0.05 mm except that the intensity of the stop at position 5 was increased as described for other trypanosomatid SL RNAs (data not shown). Next, we determined the effect of mutating positions 1–4 of the SL RNA on utilization of the SL RNA in the first step of splicing (Fig.3, A and B) and in overall trans-splicing (Fig.4, B and C). By primer extension with the radiolabeled SL 3′-end-specific oligonucleotide four primer extension products are observed (Fig.3 A). The longest cDNAs represent full-length SL RNA. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the shorter cDNAs are derived from Y structure intermediates of wild-type and tagged SL RNAs. By this assay Y structures derived from the tagged SL RNA could only be detected for mutant SL-4 (Fig. 3 A). It should be noted that the control cell line used in this experiment expressed the tagged G31A SL RNA at a level lower than that of wild-type SL RNA, as documented in the quantitation analysis (Fig. 3 B). To normalize the utilization of the above mutant SL RNAs in trans-splicing, we first determined for each cell line the ratio between the expression of mutant and wild-type SL RNA using the data from the Northern analysis of Fig. 2 A (the expression level of G31A was derived from data not shown). Next, we calculated the ratio between the Y structure intermediates derived from mutant and wild-type SL RNA (Fig. 3 A) and corrected this value by the expression coefficient of each of the SL RNA mutants. The corresponding values are indicated as adjusted values in Fig. 3, B, c. In contrast, using the poisoning primer extension assay (Fig. 4) in the four mutant cell lines SL-1, SL-2, SL-3, and SL-4 we detected low levels of DHFR-neo cDNA terminating at G25, which is diagnostic of utilization the tagged SL exon intrans-splicing (Fig. 4 B). This assay has greater sensitivity than the direct visualization of Y structures because Y structures are transient intermediates in trans-splicing whereas trans-spliced mRNA is atrans-splicing product that accumulates in cells. Quantitation of the data (Fig. 4 C) as described above showed that substitution of the individual nucleotides of the cap 4 severely impaired the utilization of the corresponding mutant SL RNAs intrans-splicing. In conclusion, there was a strong correlation between the methylation status of the SL RNA and its ability to function in splicing. Next, we examined the exon mutations using the same procedures described above. All exon mutations (E-1 to E-6) substituted four nucleotides at the time except for mutant E-1, which during mutagenesis lost one residue between positions 5 and 8, thus reducing the size of the corresponding SL RNA by one nucleotide. Mutants E-1, E-2, and E-3 encompassed positions 5–16, immediately adjacent to the cap 4 nucleotides and representing part of the single-stranded region at the 5′-end of the SL RNA. Work by Bindereif and co-workers (13Lücke S., Xu, G.L. Palfi Z. Cross M. Bellofatto V. Bindereif A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4380-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) suggested that these sequences might contain determinants for cap 4 modification/trans-splicing. Mutations E-4 and E-5 were introduced to assess the functional significance of the 5′-portion of stem I, which is of interest because it encompasses the 5′-splice site. Lastly, mutant E-6 changed nt 33–36, which are part of putative base pair interactions with the Spliced Leader Associated RNA1 or SLA1 (19Watkins K.P. Dungan J.M. Agabian N. Cell. 1994; 76: 171-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All mutant genes were efficiently expressed at levels either comparable to or higher than the wild-type SL RNA (Fig.5). In two cases, namely mutants E-1 and E-2, the expression level of the mutant SL RNA was higher than that of wild-type SL RNA, and this was concomitant with repression of wild-type SL RNA expression. Such a phenomenon was previously observed (17Xu Y-X. Liu L. Michaeli S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27883-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the accumulation of Y structures in the RNA derived from the various cell lines (Fig.6 A). All mutant SL RNAs were active in the first step of splicing, albeit at different levels. Fig.6 B shows the quantitation of the results of Fig.6 A taking into account the levels of expression of mutant and wild-type SL RNAs in each cell line. Three phenotypes were observed concerning the levels of Y structures derived from the mutant or the wild-type SL RNA, namely comparable to wild-type (E-3, E-4), higher than wild-type (E-5), and lower than wild-type (E-1, E-2, and E-6). From this analysis we concluded that mutations E-1, E-2, and E-6 decreased the efficiency of the first step of splicing, whereas mutations E-3 and E-4 did not affect the first step of splicing at a detectable level. The observation that the mutant E-5 SL RNA had higher than wild-type levels of Y structures could result either from a more efficient utilization of the mutant SL RNA in splicing or from a defect in the second step of trans-splicing leading to accumulation of the Y structure intermediate.Figure 6Utilization of SL RNAs carrying exon mutations in the first step of splicing.

https://openalex.org/W2048222765,"Trypanosoma cruzi adenylyl cyclases are encoded by a large polymorphic gene family. Although several genes have been identified in this parasite, little is known about the properties and regulation of these enzymes. Here we report the cloning and characterization of TczAC, a novel member ofT. cruzi adenylyl cyclase family. The TczAC gene is expressed in all of the parasite life forms and encodes a 1,313-amino acid protein that can complement a Saccharomyces cerevisiaemutant deficient in adenylyl cyclase activity. The recombinant enzyme expressed in yeasts is constitutively active, has a low affinity for ATP (Km = 406 μm), and requires a divalent cation for catalysis. TczAC is inhibited by Zn2+and the P-site inhibitor 2′-deoxyadenosine 3′-monophosphate, suggesting some level of conservation in the catalytic mechanism with mammalian adenylyl cyclases. It shows a dose-dependent stimulation by Ca2+ which can be reversed by high concentrations of phenothiazinic calmodulin inhibitors. However, bovine calmodulin fails to stimulate the enzyme. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen it was found that TczAC interacts through its catalytic domain with the paraflagellar rod protein, a component of the flagellar structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TczAC can dimerize through the same domain. These results provide novel evidence of the possible localization and regulation of this protein. Trypanosoma cruzi adenylyl cyclases are encoded by a large polymorphic gene family. Although several genes have been identified in this parasite, little is known about the properties and regulation of these enzymes. Here we report the cloning and characterization of TczAC, a novel member ofT. cruzi adenylyl cyclase family. The TczAC gene is expressed in all of the parasite life forms and encodes a 1,313-amino acid protein that can complement a Saccharomyces cerevisiaemutant deficient in adenylyl cyclase activity. The recombinant enzyme expressed in yeasts is constitutively active, has a low affinity for ATP (Km = 406 μm), and requires a divalent cation for catalysis. TczAC is inhibited by Zn2+and the P-site inhibitor 2′-deoxyadenosine 3′-monophosphate, suggesting some level of conservation in the catalytic mechanism with mammalian adenylyl cyclases. It shows a dose-dependent stimulation by Ca2+ which can be reversed by high concentrations of phenothiazinic calmodulin inhibitors. However, bovine calmodulin fails to stimulate the enzyme. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen it was found that TczAC interacts through its catalytic domain with the paraflagellar rod protein, a component of the flagellar structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TczAC can dimerize through the same domain. These results provide novel evidence of the possible localization and regulation of this protein. Adenylyl cyclases, the enzymes responsible for cAMP synthesis, have been classified in different families according to their biochemical and structural properties (1Patel T.B., Du, Z. Pierre S. Cartin L. Scholich K. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 2Hurley J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7599-7602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The mammalian adenylyl cyclases that present 12 transmembrane domains (families I–IX) have been the most studied and well characterized members of these families. All of these isoforms share a conserved structure with two domains of six transmembrane helices (MI 1The abbreviations used are: MI, MII, CI, and CII, transmembrane I and II domains and catalytic I and II domains of mammalian adenylyl cyclases, respectively; CD, catalytic domain; AC1, CD fused to LexA DNA binding domain; AC2, CD fused to GAl4 transcription activating domain; AC3, CD fused to VP16 transcription activating domain; 2′deoxy-3′AMP, 2′-deoxyadenosine 3′-monophosphate; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); LAM, lamin protein fused to LexA domain; PAR, paraflagellar rod protein fused to VP16 domain. and MII) and two intracellular catalytic domains (CI and CII), highly homologous but not identical, which are both required to achieve maximal catalytic activity. Trypanosomatid adenylyl cyclases share little sequence homology with their mammalian counterparts and have a completely different structure. So far, these proteins have been described to have a unique intracellular catalytic domain, which is highly conserved, one transmembrane domain, and a large extracellular variable N-terminal domain, a structure that resembles that of guanylyl cyclase receptors (3Lucas K.A.

In Trypanosoma cruzi a peptide produced by proteolysis of αd-globin in the hindgut of Triatoma infestans vector can stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity and induce differentiation of epimastigotes to metacyclic trypomastigotes (9Fraidenraich D.

Parasitol. 1995; 81: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, peptides released from proteolysis of fibronectin increase cAMP levels in trypomastigotes (11Ouaissi A. Cornette J. Schoneck R. Plumas-Marty B. Taibi A. Loyens M. Capron A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 68-79PubMed Google Scholar) and cAMP analogs and phosphodiesterase inhibitors have also been reported to induce the differentiation of this parasite (12Rangel-Aldao R. Triana F. Fernandez V. Comach G. Abate T. Montoreano R. Biochem. Int. 1988; 17: 337-344PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to this, in Trypanosoma brucei two peaks of cAMP have been observed previous to the differentiation from bloodstream to procyclic forms (13Rolin S. Paindavoine P. Hanocq-Quertier J. Hanocq F. Claes Y., Le Ray D. Overath P. Pays E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a low mass factor purified from high density cultures of the T. brucei slender form triggers cell cycle arrest and differentiation through a mechanism likely mediated by cAMP (14Vassella E. Reuner B. Yutzy B. Boshart M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2661-2671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another second messenger that has been connected to the trypanosomatid differentiation process is calcium (15Stojdl D.F. Clarke M.W. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Lammel E.M. Barbieri M.A. Wilkowsky S.E. Bertini F. Isola E.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The addition of T. infestans intestinal homogenate, which has been shown to trigger this process, induces an increase in intracellular calcium levels inT. cruzi epimastigotes. Moreover, Ca2+ chelators and calmodulin inhibitors decrease or even block the in vitro differentiation of T. cruzi (16Lammel E.M. Barbieri M.A. Wilkowsky S.E. Bertini F. Isola E.L. Exp. Parasitol. 1996; 83: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Many of the calcium-binding proteins described in trypanosoma are located in the flagellum, organelle that seems to be crucial for Ca2+ signaling in trypanosomatids (17Engman D.M. Krause K.H.

Interestingly,T. brucei calmodulin is able to interact with the structural flagellar protein paraflagellar rod in a calcium-dependent manner (22Ridgley E. Webster P. Patton C. Ruben L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the role of this structural protein in the calcium signaling pathway remains unknown. This article provides novel information on the molecular and biochemical characteristics of the first calcium-activated adenylyl cyclase from T. cruzi. This enzyme can dimerize through its catalytic domain and also interact with the flagellar protein paraflagellar rod, providing new information to the understanding of the regulatory mechanism of the cAMP signaling pathway in this parasite. All radiochemicals used in this work were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Restriction endonucleases were from New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Bacto-tryptose, yeast nitrogen base, and liver infusion were purchased from Difco Laboratories. T. cruzi epimastigote forms (CL Brenner strain) were cultured for 7 days at 28 °C in LIT medium (5 g/liter liver infusion, 5 g/liter Bacto-tryptose, 68 mmNaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 22 mmNa2HPO4, 0.2% glucose, 0.002% hemin) supplemented with 10% calf serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 mg/liter streptomycin. Cell viability was assessed by direct microscopic examination. T. cruzi trypomastigote forms were a gift from Dr. M. Maria Julia Manso-Alvez. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, T503A (Mat-α, leu2, his3, trp1, ura3, cyr 1–2) and L40 (Mat-α, his3D200, trp1–901, leu2–3,112 ade2 LYS2::(lexAop)4-HIS3 URA3::(lexAop)8-lacZ) were grown in YPD medium at 30 °C before transformation. Transformants were selected in minimal medium containing 0.17% yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids and ammonium sulfate), 0.5% ammonium sulfate, and 2% glucose, supplemented with the corresponding amino acid mixture. The minimal medium used for two-hybrid assays also contained 1% succinic acid and 0.6% NaOH. Genomic DNA was purified as described by Pereira et al. (23Pereira C.A. Alonso G.D. Paveto M.C.

Total RNA was prepared from 4×1010 epimastigotes using the total RNA isolation (TRIzol) reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Two degenerate oligonucleotides were designed from previously cloned adenylyl cyclases fromLeishmania donovani and T. brucei(5′-AC(G/T/C)CT(G/T/C)AT(C/T)TT(C/T)AC(G/T/C)GA(C/T)AT-3′ L1 primer and 5′-GA(A/G)GT(G/T/C)AAGAC(G/T/C)GT(G/T/C)GG(G/T/C)GA-3′ L2 primer). PCR amplifications were carried out using 600–800 ng of T. cruzi genomic DNA, 100 ng of each primer, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 1–2 units ofTaq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). After sequencing, the 642-bp product showed homology to trypanosomatid adenylyl cyclases. This fragment was used as a probe to screen a λ FIX II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) genomic library from T. cruzi (24Zingales B. Rondinelli E. Degrave W. da Silevira F. Levin M., Le Paslier D. Modabber F. Dobrokhotov B.B. Swindle J. Kelly J.M. Åslung L. Hoheisel J.D. Ruiz A.M. Cazzulo J.J. Petterson U. Frash A.C. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 13: 16-22PubMed Google Scholar). DNA from one phage clone was purified using the Qiagen Lambda midi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides designed from the sequence previously obtained were used for sequencing. For Northern blot analysis, 15 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (AmershamBiosciences), and hybridized at 65 °C in Church's buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.5% Na2PO4) with the specific TczAC probe. This probe was obtained by PCR amplification of phage DNA with the primers 5′-CAGCCGTCGGGTGGTGACCGTGTC-3′ and 5′-TTAACCACTGGCACAGTCACTATA-3′. Blots were subjected to sequential stringent washes at 65 °C and exposed to AGFA CP-BU NEW films (AGFA-Gevaert N.V., Belgium). Southern blot analysis were performed with 5 μg of genomic DNA previously digested with the indicated restriction endonucleases. The products were resolved on 0.8% agarose gels, transferred, and hybridized as described for Northern blots. All probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-a-Gene kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA for PCR amplification was obtained from total RNA of epimastigote, trypomastigote, and amastigote forms of T. cruzi using the ThermoScriptTM reverse transcription-PCR system (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Amplifications were performed using a specific oligonucleotide from the 5′-untranslated region of TczAC and an oligonucleotide within the coding region which were not present in previously described TczAC sequences. TczAC full-length or catalytic domains (CD; amino acids 854–1105) were amplified using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-ATGGCGGTGGGATGGGTGGCTGTG-3′ (forward Mx6) plus 5′-TTATTGAGGAATAGACGGAGATCC-3′ (reverse Mx7) and 5′-TACTTCAGCCACAGCTCGCGTGAC-3′ (forward Mx1) plus reverse Mx7, respectively. The products were subcloned in the pYES2 yeast expression vector (Invitrogen). The T503A yeast strain was transformed with this constructions using the lithium acetate procedure (25Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and the transformants were selected in minimal medium lacking uracil (ura− medium) at 30 °C. For complementation assays, transformants were plated at 34 °C in minimal medium lacking uracil and glucose and supplemented with 2% raffinose, 3% galactose, and 2% glycerol (gal+ medium) to induce the vector promoter. Controls were grown at 30 and 34 °C in the presence of cAMP. No differences were observed under these conditions. Yeast transformants were grown for 2 days in ura− medium, centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in gal+ medium, and grown for 16 h more. Cells were harvested, washed twice with cold TE buffer, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 units/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone), and lysed by 10 cycles of 1 min of vortexing in the presence of glass beads (425–600 μm) and cooling on ice. Unbroken cells were discarded by centrifugation at 2,500 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatants were centrifuged further for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol plus antiproteases and used as a membrane fraction. T. cruzi cultures were centrifuged at 4,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in lysis buffer, and broken by 10 cycles of freezing in liquid N2 and thawing at 4 °C. Soluble extracts and membranes were then prepared as described for yeast. For endogenous calmodulin displacement, membranes were washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 5 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm NaCl with stirring for 30 min at 4 °C and then washed twice with resuspension buffer to eliminate all EGTA. Adenylyl cyclase activity was determined as described by Flawiá et al.(26Flawiá M.M. Kornblihtt A.R. Reig J.A. Torruella M. Torres H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8255-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, assays were performed in triplicate with 30–50 μg of protein from the corresponding yeast fractions or 10–15-μg T. cruzi extracts, in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm Mg2+ or Mn2+, 5 mm 3-isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 mm cAMP, and 1 mm [α-32P]ATP (200 cpm/pmol). Incubations were carried out for 20 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 200 μl. The CD of TczAC used for complementation assays was subcloned in the pBTM116 vector (trp+) in fusion with the LexA DNA binding domain (27Bartel P. Chien C. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1993: 153-179Google Scholar). The construct was used to transform the L40 strain. Expression of the fusion protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-LexA antibodies (CLONTECH), and correct folding of the catalytic site was confirmed by adenylyl cyclase assays. L40 cells expressing the LexA-TczAC fusion protein were transformed with 300 μg of a T. cruzi cDNA library subcloned in the pVP16 vector (leu+ (28Gomez E.B. Santori M.I. Ları́a S. Engel J.C. Swindle J. Eisen H. Szankasi P. Téllez-Iñon M.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 113: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)). Transformants were selected by growing in minimal medium lacking tryptophan and leucine for 16 h to obtain an efficient expression of the HIS3 gene. Positive clones were then selected for histidine protrotrophy and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. cDNA fragments subcloned in the pVP16 vector from positive clones were amplified by PCR from yeast plasmid extracts using primers matching the vector sequences. The amplified fragments were subcloned in the pGEM-T-easy vector (Promega) and sequenced. L40 yeasts expressing CD-LexA were transformed with the plasmid pGAD (leu+) also containing the CD region of the TczAC gene but in fusion with the Gal4 transcription-activating domain (CLONTECH). Positive clones were selected as described previously, and β-galactosidase assays were performed to assess dimerization of the catalytic domain. For plate assays of β-galactosidase activity, yeast cells were grown in the corresponding minimal medium and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Cells were permeabilized by floating for 30 s and then submerging for 5 s more in liquid N2. Membranes were suspended in Whatman 3MM filters soaked in Z buffer containing 0.06% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; Amresco Inc., Solon, OH). Liquid assays were performed as described by Pestka et al. (29Pestka S. Daugherty B.L. Jung V. Hotta K. Pestka R.K. Genetics. 1984; 81: 7525-7528Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in triplicate. Sequence identity was analyzed using the BLAST program (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/index.html). Signal peptide and transmembrane regions were determined using the programs SMART (smart.embl-heidelberg.de/), DAS (www.sbc.su.se/∼miklos/DAS/), SPLIT (pref.etfos.hr/cgi-bin/split/), TMPRED (www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_Form.html), and PRED-TMT (o2.db.uoa.gr/ PRED-TMR/). Two degenerate oligonucleotides designed from L. donovani andT. brucei adenylyl cyclase gene sequences were used to amplify a DNA fragment from T. cruzigenomic DNA. A 642-bp fragment was obtained and sequenced, showing a significant homology with previously cloned trypanosomatid adenylyl cyclases. The fragment was used to screen a λ FIX II genomic library from T. cruzi (24Zingales B. Rondinelli E. Degrave W. da Silevira F. Levin M., Le Paslier D. Modabber F. Dobrokhotov B.B. Swindle J. Kelly J.M. Åslung L. Hoheisel J.D. Ruiz A.M. Cazzulo J.J. Petterson U. Frash A.C. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 13: 16-22PubMed Google Scholar). After three rounds of screening, six clones with 10–15-kbp inserts were isolated. One of these clones was sequenced and revealed an open reading frame coding a 1,313-amino acid polypeptide (Fig.1 A). This sequence was designated TczAC and deposited in the GenBank data base under the accession number AAC61849. Transmembrane regions predicted using the DAS software showed that TczAC has five putative transmembrane domains, corresponding to amino acid positions 1–38, 608–628, 658–679, 830–852, and 1281–1307 (Fig. 1 B). The first domain corresponds to a predicted signal peptide with a putative cleavage site between amino acids 37 and 38. If only the domain with higher score (amino acids 830–852) is considered, the structure of TczAC would be identical to those assigned previously to trypanosomatid adenylyl cyclases having a large extracellular N-terminal domain, a unique transmembrane domain, and one intracellular catalytic domain (5Naula C. Seebeck T. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 35-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Taylor M.C. Muhia D.K. Baker D.A. Mondragon A. Schaap P. Kelly J.M. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1987; 22: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, compared with the 12 transmembrane domains of the mammalian adenylyl cyclase Cya1 (Fig.1 B), the possibility that the other predicted regions could represent transmembrane domains should not be discarded. If all of these elements are taking into account, TczAC would differ from the previously described structure of trypanosomatid proteins in that the extracellular N-terminal domain would be connected by three transmembrane spans to the catalytic domain, and this one would be anchored to the membrane by its C-terminal hydrophobic region resembling mammalian adenylyl cyclase catalytic domains. Similar results were obtained using the programs TMPRED, SPLIT, and PRED-TMR. Using the Blast program, it was found that TczAC presents an identity with trypanosomatid adenylyl cyclases which varies from 60 to 67% forT. cruzi enzymes to 35 to 48% for L. donovani and T. brucei enzymes (TableI). In contrast, the identity observed with mammalian adenylyl cyclase was less than 25%. Dyctiostelium discoideum-specific germination adenylyl cyclase (ACG) was also compared because it has a trypanosoma-like structure. The sequence identity with this protein was very low as well. Further analysis showed that the sequence corresponding to the catalytic domain was highly conserved, up to 80%, whereas the N-terminal domain was less conserved (<57%) and showed no significant similarity with mammalian counterparts (Table I).Table IComparison of amino acid identity of TczAC entire protein, catalytic domain or N-terminal domainOrganism (gene)Entire proteinCatalytic domainN-terminal domain%%%T. cruzi (ADC1)677557T. cruzi (ADC4)607349T. equiperdum(eESAG4c)5861T. brucei (GRESAG 4.3)435834T. congolense(TcADCYC1)4857L. donovani(RacA)355334H. sapiens(NPGCR)2427NSaNS, not significant.D. discodeum (ACG)2525NSB. taurus (AC1 cya1)23<20NSSequences were compared using the BLAST program.

Despite the poor conservation between TczAC and mammalian adenylyl cyclases, most of the amino acids required for catalytic activity and ATP specificity were strongly conserved (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, amino acids involved in the interaction with the diterpene activator forskolin and Gα or βγ subunits of G proteins were absent, suggesting a different regulatory mechanism for this enzyme (Fig. 1 C). It is worth mentioning that the putative signal peptide of TczAC presented no homology, even compared with trypanosomatids proteins. This may suggest that this sequence could act as a specific localization signal for TczAC. Southern blot analysis using a specific probe representing most of TczAC gene (nucleotides 112–3292) showed that even when T. cruzi genomic DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases that do not cut within the TczAC gene, more than one band was recognized. This confirms that TczAC is part of a large multiple gene family ofT. cruzi (Fig. 2 A(6Taylor M.C. Muhia D.K. Baker D.A. Mondragon A. Schaap P. Kelly J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 104: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). Northern blot analysis of T. cruzi epimastigote RNA reveals at least three bands, of ∼5.8, 4.7, and 3.9 kbp, indicating that more than one isoform of this protein are expressed in this stage of the parasite (Fig. 2 B). DNA fragments corresponding to the TczAC full-length sequence or the CD were cloned in the yeast expression vector pYES2. The T503A yeast strain was transformed with these constructions. This strain has a thermosensitive adenylyl cyclase inserted in thecyr1-2 allele and cannot grow at 34 °C in the absence of exogenous cAMP. Full-length TczAC and a control plasmid containing the yeast wild type cyr1 gene, but not the empty pYES2 vector, were able to rescue the mutation, allowing yeast growth at the restrictive temperature (Fig.3 A). The TczAC CD showed less growth, suggesting a partial complementation. At 30 °C no differences were observed among all transformants (Fig.3 A). Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured in soluble and membrane extracts of the complemented yeast cells. The full-length protein TczAC showed the highest specific activity (93.7 ± 1.5 pmol of cAMP/min/mg) associated with the membrane fraction (Fig. 3 B), but the CD showed significant lower activity associated with both particulate (7.2 ± 2.7 pmol of cAMP/min/mg) and soluble extracts (4.2 ± 0.5 pmol of cAMP/min/mg). The membrane association of the CD may indicate its anchor to the plasma membrane through the hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal region of TczAC. The lower activity observed for this domain would explain the partial complementation phenotype. It is important to emphasize that the transformants expressing the cyr1 gene showed very low activity. This did not correlate with the growth observed at 34 °C. It is possible to speculate that because this enzyme would be correctly regulated, small amounts of it would be enough to generate the cAMP levels required for growth. TczAC activity was characterized in membrane preparations of yeast cells expressing the entire protein. In these cells, TczAC is constitutively active and shows 8–10-fold less activity when assayed in the presence of Mg2+ than Mn2+ as a divalent cation (Fig.4 A). It has a low affinity for ATP with a Km of 406 ± 55 μm, a value within the range reported for trypanosomatid enzymes (Fig. 4 B). The enzyme is specific for ATP because a 20-fold excess of GTP did not affect its activity (data not shown). Zn2+ is known to inhibit mammalian adenylyl cyclases by binding to the A metal binding site (30Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In TczAC the metal-binding residues are conserved with mammalian enzymes (Fig. 1 B) so the effect of this divalent cation was tested. When added to the reaction mixture, Zn2+ inhibited the enzyme with an IC50 of 7 ± 2 μm (Fig.4 C). To characterize further the catalytic mechanism of TczAC, the effect of the P-site inhibitor 2′-deoxyadenosine 3′-monophosphate (2′deoxy-3′AMP) was also analyzed. P-site inhibitors are adenosine or adenine derivatives that specifically inhibit mammalian adenylyl cyclases by binding to the purine ring binding site (31Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 32Tesmer J.J. Dessauer C.W. Sunahara R.K. Murray L.D. Johnson R.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14464-14471Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 2′Deoxy-3′AMP inhibited TczAC with an IC50 of ∼100 μm. This value is between those reported for mammalian (<1 μm (33Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2380-2382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)) and bacterial (>1 mm (34Johnson R.A. Shoshani I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19035-19039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) adenylyl cyclases. As expected from the sequence analysis, the recombinant enzyme responded neither to the diterpene forskolin nor to the G protein regulators GTPγS, AlF3−, cholera toxin, or pertussis toxin (data not shown)"

In this report, data are presented to show that one component of the platelet secretory machinery, SNAP-23, is specifically cleaved by calpain in activated cells. Other proteins of the membrane fusion machinery,e.g. syntaxins 2 and 4 and α-SNAP, are not affected.In vitro studies, using permeabilized platelets, demonstrate that cleavage is time- and calcium-dependent. Analysis of SNAP-23 cleavage products suggests that the calpain cleavage site(s) is in the C-terminal third of the molecule potentially between the cysteine-rich acyl attachment sites and the C-terminal coiled-coil domain. The time course of cleavage is most consistent with late calpain-mediated events such as pp60c-srccleavage, but not early events such as protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B activation. SNAP-23 cleavage is inhibited by calpeptin, calpastatin, calpain inhibitor IV, and E-64d, but not by caspase 3 inhibitor III or cathepsin inhibitor I. When tested for their effect on secretion, none of the calpain-specific inhibitors significantly affected release of soluble components from any of the three platelet granule storage pools. These results indicate that SNAP-23 cleavage occurs after granule release and therefore may play a role in affecting granule membrane exteriorization. This is consistent with the ultrastructural morphology of calpeptin-treated platelets after activation.

Two general steps are essential to this function. First, platelets must adhere to the site of injury and secrete the components required for primary clot formation and wound healing (2Blockmans D. Deckmyn H. Vermylen J. Blood Rev. 1995; 9: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Adherence and initial activation is mediated by specific cell surface receptors. The secretory process is mediated by integral membrane proteins contributed from the granule, called v-SNAREs,1 and from the plasma membrane, called t-SNAREs (3Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E.

These proteins form a heterotrimeric complex that facilitates the fusion of granule membranes with the open canalicular system (9White J.G. Escolar G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 233-242PubMed Google Scholar). In the second phase, there is a rapid and dramatic reorganization of the cytoskeleton and plasma membrane (2Blockmans D. Deckmyn H. Vermylen J. Blood Rev. 1995; 9: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The intracellular granule membranes, which are now fused with the peripheral plasma membrane, are exteriorized, thereby increasing the overall surface area of the cell, the platelet-platelet contacts, and the platelet to vascular wall contacts. Three central processes characterize this second phase of platelet activation: cell spreading, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and microvesicle blebbing. One key enzyme in these late phase events is the cysteine protease, calpain. Calpains comprise a family of calcium-dependent, non-lysosomal, neutral, cysteine proteases that are present in most mammalian tissues (10Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 11Suzuki K. Sorimachi H. Yoshizawa T. Kinbara K. Ishiura S. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1995; 376: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The calpain superfamily consists of several, tissue-specific isoforms, called n-calpains, and two ubiquitous isozymes, called μ- and m- calpain (12Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 13Sorimachi H. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The μ- and m-calpains share ∼61% sequence identity in their catalytic domains (14Kawasaki H. Kawashima S. Mol Membr. Biol. 1996; 13: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but differ in their response to calcium. Although μ-calpain has a high affinity for Ca2+, requiring only micromolar concentrations for activation, m-calpain activation relies on millimolar Ca2+ levels (12Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Platelets contain both isoforms, but μ-calpain represents ∼90% of total calpain activity present (15Tsujinaka T. Shiba E. Kambayashi J. Kosaki G. Biochem. Int. 1983; 6: 71-80PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ariyoshi H. Kambayashi J. Sakon M. Platelets. 1995; 6: 185-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Calpains are heterodimers consisting of a conserved 30-kDa regulatory subunit and a variable, catalytic 80-kDa subunit (10Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Calcium binding to the multiple EF hands in the 80-kDa subunit triggers translocation of calpain from the cytosol to the plasma membrane (17Suzuki K. Imajoh S. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Minami Y. Ohno S. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1988; 27: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). At the plasma membrane, calpain maintains membrane association through calcium-dependent C2 domain-phospholipid binding (18Saido T.C. Shibata M. Takenawa T. Murofushi H. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24585-24590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane-bound calpain undergoes sequential autolysis of the catalytic domain, generating two distinct enzymes: the 78- and 76-kDa forms (17Suzuki K. Imajoh S. Emori Y. Kawasaki H. Minami Y. Ohno S. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1988; 27: 153-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar,19Hathaway D.R. Werth D.K. Haeberle J.R. J. Biol.

These two calpain forms display distinct substrate specificities, and each can either enhance or diminish the activity of their substrate through cleavage. For example, the 78-kDa form cleaves protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) early in platelet activation and stimulates phosphatase activity (23Frangioni J.V. Oda A. Smith M. Salzman E.W. Neel B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4843-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 24Jackson S.P. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Cooray P. Thromb.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24876-24884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas the fully autolyzed 76-kDa calpain is required for the cleavage and inactivation of pp60c-src (25Schoenwaelder S.M. Kulkarni S. Salem H.H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Yamao-Harigaya W. Saido T.C. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24876-24884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Oda A.

Calpain is also responsible for the limited proteolysis of a wide spectrum of platelet proteins including talin, filamin, α-actinin, integrin αIIbβ3, and protein kinase C, linking the function of calpain to a variety of processes including cell adhesion, cell motility, cell signaling, and cytoskeletal arrangements (27Beckerle M.C.

Chem. 1983; 258: 1156-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of calpain in secretory processes is less defined. In experiments using intact platelets and a membrane permeant calpain inhibitor, Croce et al. (32Croce K. Flaumenhaft R. Rivers M. Furie B. Furie B.C. Herman I.M. Potter D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36321-36327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) demonstrated that calpain activity is required for secretion from alpha granules. In contrast, mice deficient in μ-calpain display normal bleeding times and normal platelet granule secretion (33Azam M. Andrabi S.S. Sahr K.E. Kamath L. Kuliopulos A. Chishti A.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2213-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In other cell types, such as mouse pancreatic islet cells, calpain inhibitors have been shown to actually increase insulin secretion (34Sreenan S.K. Zhou Y.P. Otani K. Hansen P.A. Currie K.P. Pan C.Y. Lee J.P. Ostrega D.M. Pugh W. Horikawa Y. Cox N.J. Hanis C.L. Burant C.F. Fox A.P. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Still other reports indicate that elements of the secretory machinery (e.g. syntaxin 1, VAMP 2, and SNAP-25) are cleaved by calpain in stimulated alveolar epithelial cells (35Zimmerman U.J. Malek S.K. Liu L. Li H.L. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The experiments reported here seek to further probe the role of calpain in the secretory process. Initial experiments demonstrate that calpain cleaves one of the central elements of the platelet secretory machinery, SNAP-23, a t-SNARE required for all three platelet release events (3Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 5Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Lemons P.P. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chen D. Lemons P.P. Schraw T. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lemons P.P. Chen D. Whiteheart S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Calpain cleavage of SNAP-23 was dependent on platelet activation in both intact and permeabilized cells and was specific, because other components of the secretory machinery, specifically other t-SNAREs, were left intact. Calpain inhibitors, however, were without effect on secretion from dense core granules, alpha granules, or lysosomes. This data, together with the time course of SNAP-23 cleavage, suggests that it is a late event, potentially occurring after granule release. The role of calpain cleavage of SNAP-23 appears to be related to some post-secretion event, perhaps granule membrane mobilization. Consistently, calpeptin-treated platelets show an increase in intracellular membrane structures following stimulation, suggesting a defect in membrane exteriorization. Freshly banked platelets were procured as units from the Central Kentucky Blood Center (Lexington, KY). Calpeptin, μ-calpain (porcine), calpastatin, cathepsin inhibitor I,caspase 3 inhibitor III, and calpain inhibitor IV were obtained fromCalbiochem (San Diego, CA). A23187, (2S,3S)-trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucyl-amodo-3-methylbutane ethyl ester (E-64d), apyrase VII, prostaglandin I2(PGI2), andp-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide were obtained from Sigma.

Dibucaine hydrochloride was from Aldrich. All other chemicals used were reagent grade. Polyclonal anti-α-SNAP, anti-SNAP-23, and anti-syntaxin 2 and 4 antibodies were generated in our laboratory by immunization of rabbits with the appropriate recombinant proteins (36Chen D. Minger S.L.

Balch (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). All antibodies were affinity-purified with the appropriate recombinant protein or with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor 2E5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was prepared from ascites (38Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R. Rothman J.E. J.

Anti-pp60c-srcclone GD11 mAb antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) mAb was obtained from Accurate Chemical (Westbury, NY). Platelets units were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C with 3 μg/ml apyrase and 10 ng/ml PGI2 and then centrifuged at 1,400 rpm at 25 °C for 5 min to obtain the platelet pellet.

Washed platelets were resuspended in Hepes-buffered saline (20 mmHepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 154 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl), and 100-μl aliquots were incubated with 300 μmcalpeptin for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were then recalcified with 2 mm CaCl2 for 5 min and stimulated with 1 μmA23187 for the indicated times. Reactions were solubilized in 5× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Washed platelets were resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 120 mm sodium glutamate, 5 mm potassium glutamate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 3.15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and 100-μl platelet aliquots were incubated with 0.8 units/ml SLO, 4 mm ATP in Buffer A, and calpain inhibitors (as indicated) for 10 min at 25 °C. Platelets were activated with CaCl2(at given concentrations) for the specified times. Reactions were solubilized in 5× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Platelets were assayed for dense core release of [3H]5-HT, lysosomal release of β-hexosaminidase, and alpha granule release of PF4, as described previously (5Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Lemons P.P. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chen D. Lemons P.P. Schraw T. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lemons P.P. Chen D.

Prior to isolation of platelets, the platelet-rich plasma was incubated with 0.4 μCi/ml [3H]5-HT for 45 min at 37 °C with gentle shaking. Washed platelets were resuspended in Buffer A and 100-μl platelet aliquots were incubated with 0.8 units/ml SLO, 4 mm ATP in Buffer A, and calpain inhibitors (as indicated) for 10 min at 25 °C. Platelets were then stimulated to secrete granule contents with 100 μm CaCl2 for 5 min. The reactions were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min and the supernatants were retained. The remaining platelet pellet was solubilized in an equal volume of 0.5% Triton X-100 in Buffer A. Equal volumes of both supernatant and pellet fractions were then assayed for all granule exocytosis events. The data were tabulated as the percentage of marker released compared with the total marker present in each platelet reaction for lysosome and dense core granule assays, whereas alpha granule secretion was monitored as described previously (7Lemons P.P. Chen D. Whiteheart S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Visualization of calpain cleavage of talin (235 kDa) and filamin (280 kDa) required the use of 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels with a ratio of 29.6% acrylamide to 0.4% bisacrylamide (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). All other gels had a composition of 29% acrylamide:1% bisacrylamide. For all Western blotting experiments, the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Pierce) was used with secondary anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG, peroxidase-conjugated antibodies purchased from Sigma. SNAP-23-encoding DNA was inserted into the pQE-9 vector (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) as described previously (5Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Lemons P.P. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant His6-tagged SNAP-23 was prepared fromEscherichia coli and purified by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography (Qiagen) (41Whiteheart S.W.

The His6 tag and linker sequence are represented in the MS data and for ease of interpretation have the following numerical nomenclature, where Met1 represents the natural start residue of SNAP-23: Met−12-Arg-Gly-Ser-His-His-His-His-His-His-Gly-Ser-Met1-Asp2 … Reactions (50 μl) containing 20 μg of SNAP-23 alone, 2 μg of μ-calpain alone, or 20 μg of SNAP-23 and 2 μg of μ-calpain were incubated in the presence of 100 μm CaCl2 in calpain cleavage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions containing 50 μm calpeptin, 20 μg of SNAP-23, and 2 μg of μ-calpain prevented SNAP-23 degradation (data not shown). All reactions were stopped simultaneously with the addition of 5× SDS-sample buffer. Entire reactions were loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE gels, and the separated bands were excised for analysis by MALDI-TOF MS. Digestion with trypsin and MALDI-TOF MS were performed Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry Core Laboratory at the University of Louisville (www.louisville.edu/∼wmpier01/biomassspec.htm) on a fee-for-service basis. Permeabilized platelets were preincubated with 300 μm calpeptin (as indicated) and were either left resting or stimulated for 10 min with 500 μm CaCl2. The platelets were then prepared for ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy as described previously (6Chen D. Lemons P.P. Schraw T. Whiteheart S.W.

Washington, PA), 80 mm lysine (Sigma) in 0.1 m Sorenson's phosphate buffer (8.1 mg/ml KH2PO4, 1.88 mg/ml Na2HPO4) was added to the reactions, and the platelets were incubated at 4 °C for 1.5 h. The platelets were washed three times for 15 min with 0.1 m Sorenson's phosphate buffer and osmicated with 1% OsO4 in 0.1m Sorenson's for 30 min on ice. Following two brief washes in ice-cold H2O, 4% aqueous uranyl acetate was added to the platelets and they were incubated 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The platelets were washed with 0.1 m Sorenson's and dehydrated in a series of ethyl alcohols for 5 min. The platelets were rinsed with three changes of propylene oxide and infiltrated overnight in a 1:1 mixture of propylene oxide and Spurr's resin. Samples were embedded in Spurr's resin at 50 °C for 48 h. Polymerized blocks were sectioned, mounted on copper grids, and examined by transmission electron microscopy as described previously (6Chen D. Lemons P.P. Schraw T. Whiteheart S.W.

Initial experiments indicated that the t-SNARE, SNAP-23, was degraded in activated platelets (Fig. 1). Stimulation of intact platelets with 1 μmA23187 in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 caused a time-dependent degradation of talin and filamin (ABP-280), which was maximal at 5 min. Talin and filamin cleavage was inhibited by 300 μmcalpeptin, consistent with the fact that these two proteins are known calpain substrates (27Beckerle M.C. O'Halloran T. Burridge K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1986; 30: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The proteins of the platelet secretory machinery were then examined by Western blotting (Fig. 1), and it was found that SNAP-23 was also degraded in a time-dependent manner in intact cells. Other components of the platelet secretory machinery, such as the t-SNARE syntaxin 4, which is known to associate with SNAP-23 (3Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol.

As with talin and filamin cleavage, SNAP-23 degradation was inhibited by calpeptin, suggesting a role for calpain. The permeabilized platelet assay system (5Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Lemons P.P.

In Fig. 2, concentrations of free calcium greater than 10 μm were required to induce SNAP-23 degradation in SLO-permeabilized platelets. A similar free calcium concentration is required to induce secretion from permeabilized platelets (5Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Lemons P.P. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Chen D. Lemons P.P. Schraw T. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lemons P.P. Chen D. Whiteheart S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the same reactions, talin and filamin were also degraded in response to greater than 10 μm calcium. Because the permeabilized platelet system recapitulates the cleavage events initially observed in intact cells (Fig. 1), it was used for subsequent studies. Fig.3 shows that SNAP-23 degradation in permeabilized platelets was time-dependent (Fig.3 A) and reached a maximum after 5 min of stimulation at 37 °C. At each point, SNAP-23 cleavage was inhibited by 400 μm E-64d (E). SNAP-23 degradation was delayed relative to PTP-1B, which was significantly cleaved by 45 s. (Fig.3 B). The antibody used for Western blotting does not recognize the cleavage product of PTP-1B. PTP-1B is indicative of an “early” calpain substrate because it is cleaved rapidly after activation (25Schoenwaelder S.M. Kulkarni S. Salem H.H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Yamao-Harigaya W. Saido T.C. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24876-24884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 3 C, the time course of SNAP-23 cleavage was more similar to “late” substrates, such as pp60c-src, which is cleaved by calpain later in the platelet activation process (25Schoenwaelder S.M. Kulkarni S. Salem H.H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Yamao-Harigaya W. Saido T.C. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24876-24884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the production of the lower molecular weight form of pp60c-src was less efficient than that seen for cleavage of SNAP-23.Figure 3Cleavage of SNAP-23 is a late platelet activation event. A, washed platelets were preincubated in the presence of 0.8 units/ml SLO alone (R and S) or in the presence of 0.8 units/ml SLO and 400 μm E-64d (E) for 10 min at 25 °C. Platelets were either maintained as resting (R) or stimulated with 100 μmCaCl2 (S and E) for various times (15 s to 5 min), as indicated. Whole cell lysates were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-SNAP-23 (n = 4). B, SLO-permeabilized platelets were either maintained as resting (R) or stimulated with 100 μm CaCl2 for various times (15 s to 1 min), as indicated.

To further address these points, permeabilized platelets were either held in a resting state (>pCa = 9,R), stimulated with CaCl2 (S), or stimulated in the presence of calpeptin (C). To confirm activation of calpain, the reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to demonstrate that both talin and filamin were cleaved (data not shown). Inhibition of talin and filamin cleavage confirmed that the calpeptin treatment was effective (data not shown). These reactions were then probed by Western blotting using a number of antibodies to proteins known to be part of the secretory machinery in platelets. SNAP-23 was cleaved in the stimulated cells (Fig. 4,S), but the six other proteins tested were not cleaved. Of specific note, syntaxins 2 and 4, which are both known to complex with SNAP-23 in platelets (3Flaumenhaft"
https://openalex.org/W2045327693,"HIV-infected cells are selectively killed by an immunotoxin in which a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin A is joined to the variable region of a broadly neutralizing antibody (3B3) that recognizes the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env). To improve the efficacy of this molecule, we used three-dimensional structural information and phage selection data to design 23 single and multiple point mutations in the antibody variable region sequences that contact Env. Substituting an aromatic residue for an aspartate in the third complementarity-determining region of V(H) increased the potency of the immunotoxin by approximately 10-fold in a cell-killing assay. Detailed analysis of one such mutant, N31H/Q100eY, revealed both a higher affinity for monomeric and cell surface Env and an increased stability against aggregation compared with the starting immunotoxin. Conversion to a disulfide-linked two-chain format further stabilized the protein. N31H/Q100eY retained the ability to bind to Env from multiple viral isolates, to inhibit Env-mediated cell fusion, and to limit spreading viral infection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Such site-directed mutants may increase the utility of immunotoxins for reducing or eradicating persistent HIV-1 infection in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2138231889,"KN-93, a Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitor, concentration-dependently and reversibly inhibited inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP(3)R)-mediated [Ca(2+)](i) signaling in mouse eggs and permeabilized A7r5 smooth muscle cells, two cell types predominantly expressing type-1 IP(3)R (IP(3)R-1). KN-92, an inactive analog, was ineffective. The inhibitory action of KN-93 on Ca(2+) signaling depended neither on effects on IP(3) metabolism nor on the filling grade of Ca(2+) stores, suggesting a direct action on the IP(3)R. Inhibition was independent of CaMKII, since in identical conditions other CaMKII inhibitors (KN-62, peptide 281-309, and autocamtide-related inhibitory peptide) were ineffective and since CaMKII activation was precluded in permeabilized cells. Moreover, KN-93 was most effective in the absence of Ca(2+). Analysis of Ca(2+) release in A7r5 cells at varying [IP(3)], of IP(3)R-1 degradation in eggs, and of [(3)H]IP(3) binding in Sf9 microsomes all indicated that KN-93 did not affect IP(3) binding. Comparison of the inhibition of Ca(2+) release and of [(3)H]IP(3) binding by KN-93 and calmodulin (CaM), either separately or combined, was compatible with a specific interaction of KN-93 with a CaM-binding site on IP(3)R-1. This was also consistent with the much smaller effect of KN-93 in permeabilized 16HBE14o(-) cells that predominantly express type 3 IP(3)R, which lacks the high affinity CaM-binding site. These findings indicate that KN-93 inhibits IP(3)R-1 directly and may therefore be a useful tool in the study of IP(3)R functional regulation."

Here, we show that this region is involved in regulating gating in a mouse isoform of the pacemaker channel (mHCN2). A mutation in the GYG sequence of the selectivity filter (G404S) had different effects on the two components of the wild-type current; it eliminated the slowly activating current (If) but, surprisingly, did not affect the instantaneous current (Iinst).

Experiments with the wild-type channel showed that the rate of If deactivation and If amplitude had a parallel dependence on the ratio of K+/Na+ driving forces. In addition, the amplitude of fully activated If, unlike Iinst, was not well predicted by equal and independent flow of K+ and Na+. The data are consistent with two separable gating mechanisms associated with pacemaker channels: one (If) that is sensitive to voltage, to a mutation in the selectivity filter, and to driving forces for permeating cations and another (Iinst) that is insensitive to these influences.

If is involved in regulating membrane potential and spontaneous activity in a variety of excitable cells (8Pape H.C. Annu. Rev.

If has a clear role in the sino-atrial node, where its activation upon hyperpolarization, deactivation upon depolarization, and permeability to both Na+ and K+, are important for regulating the rate of diastolic depolarization (9DiFrancesco D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 455-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). If is also important in thalamocortical neurons where its deactivation produces a slowly decaying after-depolarization that determines the length of refractory periods separating episodes of synchronized oscillations (8Pape H.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 299-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 10Bal T. McCormick D. J. Neurophys. 1997; 77: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that HCN2 channels produce an instantaneous and Cs+-insensitive current component (Iinst) in addition to the hyperpolarization-activated and Cs+-sensitive If component (11Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Iinst was not affected by a mutation in the S4 transmembrane segment (S306Q) whereas If was greatly reduced. Thus, our data support a role for the S4 segment in voltage-dependent gating (If), as suggested previously for HCN channels (12Chen J. Mitcheson J.S. Lin M. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Biol.

Despite permeability to both K+ and Na+, the HCN pore contains a conserved GYG sequence that is found in many potassium-selective channels (14Lipkind G.M. Hanck D.A. Fozzard H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9215-9219Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Heginbotham L., Lu, Z. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Studies examining the effects of mutations in the selectivity filter of K+ channels have shown that conformational changes in this region contribute directly to channel gating (16Lu T., Wu, L. Xiao J. Yang J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 17So I. Ashmole I. Davies N.W. Sutcliffe M.J. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol. 2001; 531: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Permeant and blocking ions such as Rb+, K+, and Cs+ also affect the closing of K+ channels, implicating the selectivity filter in voltage-dependent gating (18Lu T. Ting A.Y. Mainland J. Jan L.Y. Schultz P.G. Yang J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Wang Z. Zhang X. Fedida D. J.

Bezanilla F. Rojas E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1973; 62: 375-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Finally, the KcsA K+ channel selectivity filter and activation gate have recently been shown to have different conformations in conditions of low K+ and high K+, which could explain the effects of permeant ions on gating (22Zhou Y. Morais-Cabral J.H. Kaufman A. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2001; 414: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). Based on the similarity of the pore structure in HCN and K+ channels, it seems likely that the selectivity filter and the voltage-dependent gate of HCN channels are linked structurally such that changes in one influence the function of the other. However, this has not been directly demonstrated. In this study, we carried out experiments to determine whether the selectivity filter is coupled to gating in HCN channels using mouse HCN2 subunits expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We found that If was sensitive to a mutation in the selectivity filter and to different concentrations of permeating cations, whereas Iinst was insensitive to these influences. The results may be explained by changes in pore conformation upon hyperpolarization, and/or by the presence of a second pore that is: 1) found within the same channel, 2) formed by a second population of the same channel subunits, or 3) associated with HCN channels in the form of up-regulated endogenous channels. The G404S mutant was constructed by overlapping PCR mutagenesis from a mouse HCN2 template as previously described (11Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The amplified mutagenic product and wild-type mHCN2, in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (6Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), were subsequently digested using NheI and BlpI. The fragment digested out of wild-type mHCN2 was replaced by the complementary fragment carrying the mutation. The mutation was confirmed by restriction analysis and automated sequencing (Biotechnology Laboratory, University of British Columbia, Vancouver Canada). CHO-K1 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), maintained in Hams F-12 media supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were plated onto glass coverslips and 1 day after splitting were transiently co-transfected with mammalian expression vectors encoding wild-type and/or mutant mHCN2 channels (4 μg per 35-mm dish) along with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter plasmid (0.3 μg per dish) using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells expressing GFP were chosen for whole-cell recordings 24–48 h after transfection or co-transfection with mHCN2. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 130, KCl; 10, NaCl; 0.5, MgCl2; 1, EGTA; 5, HEPES; pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. The extracellular solution contained (in mm) 140, XCl (X = sum of K+ and Na+); 1.8, CaCl2; 0.5, MgCl2; 5, HEPES; pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. For solution changes, a 200-μl bath was completely exchanged and perfused (0.5–1 ml/min) for at least 1 min prior to collecting data. Whole-cell patch clamp currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and Clampex software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) at room temperature (20–22 °C). Currents were not leak-subtracted and capacitance compensation was not used. Patch clamp pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and were fire polished before use (pipette resistance is 2.5–4.5 MΩ). Data were filtered at 2 kHz and were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments), Origin (Microcal, Northampton, MA) and Excel (Microsoft, Seattle, WA) software. The current densities plotted in Fig. 2,A and B were determined by dividing measured currents by the capacitance, which was estimated by the ClampEx software from the time constant of the current elicited by a 2 mV test pulse at the beginning of whole-cell recording. Time constants to assess rates of activation and deactivation were generated using a single exponential fitting procedure. An initial delay occurred prior to If deactivation that was not well described by a single exponential function, as described previously (5Santoro B. Chen S. Luthi A. Pavlidis P. Shumyatsky G.P. Tibbs G.R. Siegelbaum S.A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5264-5275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,25Altomare C. Bucchi A. Camatini E. Baruscotti M. Viscomi C. Moroni A. DiFrancesco D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and therefore was not used in our fits. Fig. 4 uses values of Iinst corrected for the presence of endogenous instantaneous currents. Previously, we found that the amplitude of Iinst was 41 and 48% larger than the instantaneous current determined in cells transfected with only GFP or with the pHOOK membrane protein (a single chain antibody, fused to the C terminus of the transmembrane domain from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, that allows for the antibody to be anchored and displayed on the extracellular side of the CHO cell plasma membrane), at −140 mV and −65 mV, respectively (11Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These proportions were used to estimate the amplitudes of instantaneous current due only to HCN2, plotted in Fig. 4, C and D(Iinst(corrected)). At 24–48 h post-transfection, cells on coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. The cells were then washed with PBS, permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS). After one wash with PBS containing 1% NGS, the cells were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to HCN2 (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel) at a dilution of 1:400 in PBS with 1% NGS for 48 h at 4 °C. The antibody was removed, and cells were again washed with PBS. Cells were then incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit antibody tagged with cyanine 3 (Cy3) (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, Pennsylvania) at a dilution of 1:200 in PBS with 1% NGS for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The antibody was removed, cells were washed in PBS, and the coverslips with cells were mounted on slides using Permount (Fisher Scientific). Cells were examined using wide-field and confocal microscopy with an Olympus BX 40 inverted microscope, equipped with epifluorescence and appropriate filters, and an inverted Zeiss TurboPascal confocal microscope, respectively. For confocal microscopy, serial sections were taken in 0.8–1.0 μm steps using a ×63 oil immersion objective lens and an excitation wavelength of 543 nm. Our initial strategy to examine the involvement of the selectivity filter in gating was to introduce a mutation into the GYG sequence of mHCN2 (G404S) and determine its effects on expressed currents. Fig. 1 shows that the region of the pore encompassing the selectivity filter has significant homology among different classes of K+ channels and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. We mutated the glycine at position 404 to a serine (Fig. 1, asterisk). Serine was chosen because the corresponding mutation (G629S) in the human ether-a-go-go-related channel (HERG), which is related to HCN channels, eliminated slowly activating current but not trafficking to the plasma membrane (23Zhou Z. Gong Q. Epstein M.L. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21061-21066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Cells expressing G404S produced little If, even in a high K+ (135 mm) extracellular solution (Fig.2 A). We determined If and Iinst densities (see “Experimental Procedures”) in cells expressing wild-type HCN2 and G404S in order to control for variability in cell surface area. Cells expressing G404S produced significantly less If than did cells expressing wild-type HCN2 (Fig. 2 B). The instantaneous current associated with G404S (Iinst(G404S)) and wild-type HCN2 (Iinst(HCN2)) were significantly larger than the instantaneous current observed in cells expressing only GFP (Iinst(GFP)) but were not significantly different from each other (Fig. 2, A and C). The reversal potentials of Iinst(G404S) and Iinst(HCN2) were significantly more positive than the reversal potential of Iinst(GFP) but not significantly different from each other (Fig. 2 D). This indicates that the expression of either wild-type HCN2 or G404S added a conductance with a reversal potential positive to that of the endogenous channels found in CHO cells expressing only GFP. The similar reversal potentials for Iinst(G404S) and Iinst(HCN2) suggests similar selectivities for the wild-type HCN2 and G404S channels. Like Iinst(HCN2), Iinst(G404S) was significantly (p < 0.05) and reversibly reduced by cAMP elevation with perfusion of 100 μm IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine), an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase that inhibits the breakdown of cAMP, and 100 μm forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase that increases cAMP formation (−931.2 ± 139.8 pA, n = 17; −858.8 ± 127.5 pA, n = 17; −1048.0 ± 174.1 pA,n = 15; before IBMX and forskolin, after 1 min in IBMX and forskolin, and after a 1-min wash, respectively). Finally, we found that Iinst(G404S) was unaffected by 2 mmCs+, like Iinst(HCN2) (11Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) but unlike If, which is blocked by 2 mm Cs+(26DiFrancesco D. J. Physiol. 1984; 348: 341-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For confirmation of the presence of G404S on the plasma membrane, we examined subcellular localization in CHO cells of wild-type or mutant channels and labeled with an anti-HCN2 primary antibody and a Cy3-tagged secondary antibody. As shown by optical sections of cells expressing either wild-type HCN2 or G404S, there was a very strong pattern of fluorescence along the periphery of the cells suggesting the presence of HCN2 protein on the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 E). Bright patches of fluorescence were observed in the interior of the cells, which probably represented channel protein present in discrete intracellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, vesicles mediating transport to or from the plasma membrane, or degradatory compartments. There was relatively little fluorescence in non-transfected cells present in the image field of Fig.2 E, or in mock-transfected cells (not shown). We have shown previously that the wild-type channel and the S306Q mutant demonstrated a similar pattern of localization, whereas a mutant lacking the cyclic-nucleotide binding domain (CNBD) and distal C terminus did not express currents and demonstrated a very different pattern of localization that did not include fluorescence on the periphery of CHO cells (11Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The imaging data and the significant increase in instantaneous current support the presence of G404S on the plasma membrane and the selective disruption of hyperpolarization-activated gating (If) by the G404S mutation. To further examine the role of the selectivity filter in voltage-dependent gating of HCN channels, we determined the effects of permeating cations on If kinetics. Whole-cell current traces from cells expressing HCN2 are shown in Fig.3 A. We compared rates of deactivation and amplitudes of fully activated If at the same potential but at different ratios of extracellular K+/Na+ because both cations permeate HCN channels (24Moroni A. Barbuti A. Altomare C. Viscomi C. Morgan J. Baruscotti M. DiFrancesco D. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 439: 618-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We used a protocol consisting of a prepulse to −140 mV followed by a test pulse to −65 mV. These voltages were chosen for several reasons. First, the channels are close to fully activated at −140 mV and fully closed at −65 mV in CHO cells (11Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Second, fully activated If amplitude and the rate of Ifdeactivation were easily determined at −65 mV over the range of extracellular K+ and Na+ concentrations studied here. Finally, −65 mV is within the ranges of potentials observed normally in many excitable cells expressing If (8Pape H.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 299-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 9DiFrancesco D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 455-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Increasing the K+/Na+ ratio produced reversible increases in the amplitude of If at −140 mV and of the tail current at −65 mV (Fig. 3, A–C). Current activation for 2-s pulses at −140 mV and deactivation at −65 mV were both well fit with a single exponential function (Fig. 3 A,inset) from which time constants were determined. Increasing the K+/Na+ ratio did not significantly increase the rate of If activation at −140 mV but substantially increased the rate of If deactivation at −65 mV (Fig. 3,A,D, and E). Deactivation also included a delay (Fig. 3 A) that has been attributed to complex changes in conformation during channel closing in both native and cloned HCN channels (25Altomare C. Bucchi A. Camatini E. Baruscotti M. Viscomi C. Moroni A. DiFrancesco D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26DiFrancesco D. J. Physiol. 1984; 348: 341-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This delay is clearly smaller in the higher K+/Na+ ratio as compared with the medium K+/Na+ ratio and cannot be distinguished in the lowest K+/Na+ ratio. Together, the increased deactivation rate and reduction in delay suggest that permeant cations affect If deactivation preferentially. We next compared how If and Iinst amplitudes depended on the changes in the K+ and Na+ driving forces, and how these compared with theoretical current values generated using the total current calculated in Equation 1, Itot=INa+IK=gNa,max(Etest−ENa)+gK,max(Etest−EK)Equation 1 where Itot, INa, and IK are the predicted current values for total If, the Na+ component, and the K+ component; (Etest − EK), and (Etest − ENa) are the driving forces for Na+ and K+; and gNa,max and gK,max are the maximum values of conductance for Na+ and K+. We assumed that: (i) each ion moved through the pore independently and (ii) gNa,max = 1 ns, a value that was obtained using the above equation and the measured If value at a ratio of 0 (when only Na+ flows through the channel). Fig. 4 A (filled boxes) shows the fully activated If as a function of the ratio of K+ and Na+ driving forces [(Etest − EK)/(Etest − ENa)] at −65 mV. An additional set of data at 10 mm K+ and 130 mm Na+was added to determine more accurately the range over which the changes occurred. The greatest change in measured If occurred between 5.4 mm K+/135 mmNa+ and 10 mm K+/130 mmNa+ where a slope of 677 pA/unit ratio of driving forces was determined (solid line, negative ratios). A smaller change occurred between 10 mm K+/130 mm Na+ and 135 mmK+/5.4 mm Na+ where a slope of 124 pA/unit ratio of driving forces was determined (solid line, positive ratios). The change in slope coincides with the change in direction of K+ flow (dotted vertical linerepresents a ratio of zero). Using gNa,max equal to gK,max, we found that the measured If lay on Itot only at ratios where the K+ driving force was relatively small (Fig.4 A, lower dashed curve). Extrapolation of the measured If to 0 pA (x-intercept) yielded a ratio of approximately −0.24. Thus, the K+ driving force in the outward direction needs to be only 0.24 of the Na+driving force in the inward direction to eliminate If. Therefore, a second theoretical relation for Itot was generated assuming that gNa,max was equal to 0.24 gK,max (Fig. 4 A, upper dashed curve). Using these unequal maximum conductances yielded a better fit to the data, suggesting that different permeabilities of each cation could account for the differences between the measured If and theoretical current amplitudes. Similarly, the fully activated If at −140 mV was plotted as a function of the ratio of driving forces (Fig. 4 B,filled boxes). Fitting with a single exponential function (solid black line) showed that the greatest change in the measured If occurred between 5.4 mmK+/135 mm Na+ and 10 mmK+/130 mm Na+, as it did at −65 mV. The theoretical values, generated assuming gNa,max = gK,max (lower dashed curve) or gNa,max = 0.24 gK,max (upper dashed curve), fit the experimental values even more poorly at −140 mV than at −65 mV. Extrapolation of the measured If values yielded an x-intercept of 0.21 indicating that If was eliminated despite the fact that driving forces were inward for both Na+ and K+. This behavior has also been reported in studies of native If (8Pape H.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 299-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 27Wollmuth L.P. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 430: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Marouka F. Nakashima Y. Takano M. Ono K. Noma A. J. Physiol. 1994; 477: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29DiFrancesco D. J. Physiol. 1982; 329: 485-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The corresponding concentrations determined at the x-intercept were 3.3 mm K+ and 136.7 mmNa+, which compares to 3.8 mm K+and 136.3 mm Na+ determined at −65 mV (Fig.4 A). These concentrations of K+ and Na+ are in a range found in vivo, indicating that the control of external cation levels is a potent mechanism for regulating If in different tissues. To determine whether Iinst could be predicted by independent flow of Na+ and K+ through the pore, we plotted the corrected Iinst (corrected for removal of endogenous leak currents as described under “Experimental Procedures”) versus the ratio of driving forces. This was compared with theoretical current values where gNa,max = gK ,max at −65 mV (Fig. 4 C) and −140 mV (Fig.4 D), as was carried out for If. A value for gNa,max was determined using the corrected value for Iinst where the ratio of driving forces = 0 (when only Na+ flows through the channel) for Itot. The measured values for Iinst were much closer to the theoretical current values than were the values of fully activated If (filled squares replotted from Fig. 4,A and B). These data suggest that hyperpolarization produces conformational changes that enhance the flow of K+ versus Na+ through the HCN pore in the fully activated open state, leading to greater than predicted values for the measured If amplitudes. Alternatively, these data could be explained by a model where the two currents (If and Iinst) flow through two different pores, both permeable to Na+ and K+but where each pore has a distinct gating mechanism. We next re-examined If deactivation at −65 mV to determine whether this was modified by permeating cations in the same range of driving forces that modify If amplitude. Here, we included the set of data points at 10 mm K+/130 mmNa+ for both If amplitude and Ifdeactivation (Fig. 5). We found that the increase in rate of If deactivation (filled squares) paralleled the increase in fully activated If(filled diamonds) at increasing K+/Na+ driving forces. Both sets of values changed most dramatically in the range of driving forces normally found in cells and where K+ moves in the outward direction. As for the fully activated If at −65 mV, deactivation time constants were joined with two straight lines on either side of the K+ reversal concentration. The most dramatic change occurred between 5.4 mm K+ /135 mm Na+ and 10 mm K+/130 mm Na+ where a straight line of slope = −4647 ms/unit ratio of driving forces joined these values. A less dramatic change occurred between 10 mm K+/130 mm Na+ and 135 mmK+/5.4 mm Na+, where a straight line of slope = −182 ms/unit ratio of driving forces joined the values. When both sets of values were normalized to the maximum values obtained, the slopes for the steep component were 2.2 and −4.0 and for the shallow component were 0.4 and −0.16, for the fully activated If and deactivation time constants, respectively. The parallel changes in both sets of values support the idea that permeating cations affect If deactivation as well as If amplitude. They also suggest that the conformational changes induced by hyperpolarization occur relatively slowly because activation, unlike deactivation, was not greatly affected by changes in K+/Na+ driving forces. Thus, after the hyperpolarizing pulse, changes in pore conformation then lead to changes in the rate of If deactivation, in the relative conductance of K+ versus Na+, and in the fully activated If amplitude. Our present findings show that in the HCN2 G404S mutant, a reduction in external K+ or application of Cs+ reduce or eliminate If without blocking Iinst. Together with our previous work demonstrating the co-existence of a slow Cs+-sensitive current (If) and an instantaneous Cs+-insensitive current (Iinst) (11Proenza C. Angoli D. Agranovich E. Macri V. Accili E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5101-5109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), these data suggest that two gating mechanisms, which can be separated functionally and structurally, are associated with HCN channels. Is it possible for two currents with different properties and structural requirements to travel through the same pore? The inhibition of If by Cs+ and G404S may be analogous to the production of distinct subconductance states in single channel currents of Kir 2.1 by the permeant cation Tl+ and by mutations of the glycine corresponding to G404 in HCN2 (16Lu T., Wu, L. Xiao J. Yang J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Lu T. Ting A.Y. Mainland J. Jan L.Y. Schultz P.G. Yang J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Certain closed-time states in this inward rectifier were independent of membrane voltage and were not produced by open-pore blockade by external or internal cations, suggesting the co-existence of a separate gating mechanism (18Lu T. Ting A.Y. Mainland J. Jan L.Y. Schultz P.G. Yang J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 30Choe H. Palmer L.G. Sackin H. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1988-2003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Voltage-independent closed to open fluctuations and subconductance levels have also been observed in Shaker K+ channels (31Zheng J. Sigworth F.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 457-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 249-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). By analogy, Iinstmay thus represent voltage-independent subconductance states and/or closed to open transitions, which are not inhibited by Cs+, G404S, or a decrease in external potassium. In this model, hyperpolarization would then produce additional subconductance states that are sensitive to Cs+ and to driving forces for permeating cations. Measurement of single channel currents will be required to examine this hypothesis in HCN channels, although this may be challenging given the small (∼1 pS) single channel conductance determined in studies of native HCN channels (33DiFrancesco D. Nature. 1986; 324: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Other voltage-gated K+ channels, such as the cloned plant K+ channels, AKT2 and AKT3 (34Lacombe B. Pilot G. Michard E. Gaymard F. Sentenac H. Thibaud J.B. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 837-851PubMed Google Scholar, 35Marten I. Hoth S. Deeken R. Ache P. Ketchum K.A. Hoshi T. Hedrich R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7581-7586Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), exhibit combinations of instantaneous leak and slowly-activating inward rectification. Single channel and whole-cell current analysis suggested that the AKT2 channels exist in two modes whose relative amounts may change over time (36Dreyer I. Michard E. Lacombe B. Thibaud J.B. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The co-existence of instantaneous, voltage-independent leak with voltage-dependent, slowly activating rectification has also been described in the KCNK2 K+ channel (37Bockenhauer D. Zilberberg N. Goldstein S.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The SLO-2 calcium-activated K+ channel has both a time-dependent outward current component and a rapidly activating current component (38Yuan A. Dourado M. Butler A. Walton N. Wei A. Salkoff L. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Finally, Liu and Joho (39Liu Y. Joho R.H. Pflugers Arch. 1998; 435: 654-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have proposed the co-existence of slow voltage-dependent and rapid voltage-independent gating mechanisms in Kv2.1. These authors suggested that there are two gates within the pore of Kv2.1 that are close, but physically separated. Given the conserved nature of the pore structure, voltage-independent leak through a separate gating mechanism may be an inherent property of channels in these related families. However, it is also possible that the co-existence of instantaneous, slowly activating currents is due to a second pore that is found within the same channel or formed by a second population of the same channel subunits or associated with the channels in the form of up-regulated endogenous channels. Permeation and gating were originally thought to be independent in ion channels but more recent evidence indicates that permeant ions affect gating and hence that these properties are coupled. Previous studies of If in sensory neurons, apical dendrites of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, and myocytes from the sinoatrial node have shown that deactivation was affected by relatively large changes in external cations (28Marouka F. Nakashima Y. Takano M. Ono K. Noma A. J. Physiol. 1994; 477: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40Mayer M.L. Westbrook G.L. J. Physiol. 1983; 340: 19-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 41Magee J.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7613-7624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite concurrent changes in If amplitude that reflected interactions of Na+ and K+ in the pore, a separate mechanism was proposed for the effects of cations on If deactivation that involve an external binding site (28Marouka F. Nakashima Y. Takano M. Ono K. Noma A. J. Physiol. 1994; 477: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The primary argument in favor of an external binding site was that only K+ could be present in the pore during measurements of outward tail currents because Na+ was not present in the intracellular solution and thus would have left the pore almost instantly upon depolarization. Our data suggest the effects of permeating cations do involve interactions in the pore because the rate of Ifdeactivation and If amplitude depended on K+/Na+ driving forces in a parallel manner. Our findings also suggest that the changes in If deactivation and If amplitude follow from hyperpolarization-induced changes in pore conformation that occur slowly during Ifactivation. These changes are related to the ability of K+to permeate the channel more readily than Na+ after hyperpolarization as well as to the direction of K+ flow. Thus, we suggest that the selectivity filter is an important structural element of voltage-dependent gating and is coupled to cation selectivity in HCN channels, as it is in related potassium channels (42Kiss L. LoTurco J. Korn S.J. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 253-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A physiologically important aspect of our experiments is that the changes in the concentration of K+ and Na+ that influence both Ifdeactivation and If amplitude are in a range that exist under certain physiological and pathophysiological conditions and thus could provide a mechanism for controlling cellular excitabilityin vivo. In the heart, changes in external K+between 3 and 10 mm may occur in situations such as exercise and can produce bradycardia mediated through If(43Paterson D.J. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 80: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 44Kleber A.G. Circ. Res. 1983; 52: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 45Choate J.K. Nandhabalan M. Paterson D.J. Exp. Physiol. 2001; 86: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, extracellular K+may vary from 3 to 12 mm, and extracellular Na+may decrease by up to 7 mm during repetitive activity (46Dietzel I. Heinemann U. Hofmeier G. Lux H.D. Exp. Br. Res. 1982; 46: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar,47Sykova E. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1983; 42: 135-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These changes in cation concentration could significantly affect the spontaneous activity of neurons that contain HCN channels, such as thalamic relay neurons, in which If deactivation and amplitude play critical roles in determining the period of time separating periods of sustained activity (10Bal T. McCormick D. J. Neurophys. 1997; 77: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The ability to balance Iinst versusIf would greatly expand the role of HCN channels in modulating the firing characteristics of neurons and cardiomyocytes. A dramatic reduction of If compared with Iinstmay explain why some neurons express HCN mRNA but do not express If (4Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). In the sino-atrial node of the heart, Iinst may contribute to the Na+- sensitive background current (Ib,Na) with which it shares several properties (48Hagiwara N. Irisawa H. Kasanuki H. Hosoda S. J. Physiol. 1992; 448: 53-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The relative effects of Ib,Na and If are important for regulating the pacemaking activity of the sino-atrial node (49Noble D. Denyer J.C. Brown H.F. DiFrancesco D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1992; 250: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and a similar balance of these current components may be important in neurons.

Mice that are completely deficient in pol β die at 18 days post-conception due to massive apoptosis of post-mitotic neurons, suggesting that pol β is essential for embryonic development (15Gu H. Marth J. Orban P. Mossmann H. Rajewsky K. Science. 1994; 265: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar, 16Sugo N. Aratani Y. Nagashima Y. Kubota Y. Koyama H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological DNA substrate for pol β is believed to be a small gap because it has been shown that pol β is processive on gaps of 6 bases or less and that the activity and fidelity of pol β are highest on a 1-bp gap with a 5′-phosphate (17Singhal R.K. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15906-15911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Chagovetz A.M. Sweasy J.B. Preston B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27501-27504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase β has a modular organization with an 8-kDa N-terminal domain connected to the 31-kDa C-terminal domain by a protease-hypersensitive hinge region. The N-terminal 8-kDa domain was originally characterized as a single-stranded DNA binding domain (19Prasad R. Kumar A. Widen S.G. Casas-Finet J.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was found to interact most efficiently with the 5′-phosphate of the downstream primer of the gapped DNA (21Casas-Finet J.R. Kumar A. Morris G. Wilson S.H. Karpel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19618-19625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss R.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This interaction is mediated by a helix-hairpin-helix motif (HhH), which is found in several other DNA repair enzymes (4Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12778-12787Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 23Doherty A.J. Serpel L.C. Ponting C.P.

Matsumoto and Kim (9Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) later demonstrated that pol β catalyzes removal of dRP from AP endonuclease-incised AP sites via β-elimination, as opposed to hydrolysis, and that this dRP lyase activity resides in the N-terminal 8-kDa domain of pol β. The DNA polymerase active site is found in the 31-kDa domain (25Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). pol β does not possess proofreading activity. We have developed a genetic screen to identify the amino acid residues of pol β that are critical for fidelity (26Sweasy J.B. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4626-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Washington S.L. Yoon M.S. Chagovetz A.M., Li, S. Clairmont C.A. Preston B.D. Eckert K.A. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our screen is based upon the discovery that rat pol β substitutes for E. coliDNA polymerase I in DNA replication (14Sweasy J.B. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1407-1410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed a library of pol β mutants in which only the 8-kDa domain of the protein was mutated. By using our genetic screen, we isolated several mutator mutants of pol β, including one that is altered from Thr to Ser at position 79 (T79S). The T79S alteration is located in helix IV of the N-terminal 8-kDa domain of pol β and appears to be distant from the catalytic active site, having no contact with the substrate during catalysis, as shown in Fig. 1. Thr-79 is positioned directly between two HhH motifs, HhH 1 and 2. HhH motif 1 interacts with the downstream oligonucleotide, and HhH 2 interacts with the primer strand in single nucleotide gapped DNA. To elucidate the role of the Thr-79 residue in maintaining pol β fidelity, we have employed a transient state kinetic approach. The catalytic pathway of pol β is shown in SchemeFS1. First, pol β binds to the DNA substrate, followed by binding to the dNTP substrate. After formation of the ternary complex of pol β, DNA, and dNTP, a conformational change occurs to produce an active complex (β*) that can catalyze DNA primer extension. After phosphodiester bond formation, pyrophosphate is released. Finally, pol β dissociates from the DNA substrate during the rate-limiting step. Mutator mutant proteins have been shown to alter kinetically the steps in the pathway of DNA polymerization (28Li S. Vaccaro J. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,29Shah A.M., Li, S.-X. Anderson K.S. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10824-10831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This often leads to a decrease in fidelity. Our transient state kinetic results demonstrate that the interaction of the HhH domains of pol β with the downstream DNA and the primer of the DNA substrate is important for accurate DNA synthesis by pol β. Our findings suggest that movements of the HhH motifs are mediated by Thr-79. This movement results in presentation of the template within the active site of pol β and stabilization of the primer. We suggest that the placement of the template within the pol β active site and stabilization of the primer strand are critical determinants of DNA synthesis fidelity. The strain BL21 DE3 was used for protein expression and has genotype F ompT hsdSB(rBmB) gal dcm(DE3). The strain FT334 is an HB101 derivative and was used to detect thymidine kinase mutations in the forward mutation assay. Its genotype is recA13 upp tdk (30Eckert K.A. Drinkwater N.R. Mutat. Res. 1987; 178: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). E. coli strains CSH50 F′((pro-lac),ara, thi, strA, F(proAB, lacIQZM15, traD36)) (31Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and MC1061 ((hsdR, hsdM+, araD (ara, leu), (lacIPOZY), galU, galK, strA)) were used in the M13 fidelity assays. Strain SC18-12 is derived from E. coli B/r and has the genotyperecA718 polA12 uvrA155 trpE65 lon-11 sulA1 (27Washington S.L. Yoon M.S. Chagovetz A.M., Li, S. Clairmont C.A. Preston B.D. Eckert K.A. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The SC18-12 strain was used in screening of a cDNA library of pol β mutants (27Washington S.L. Yoon M.S. Chagovetz A.M., Li, S. Clairmont C.A. Preston B.D. Eckert K.A. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glucose and 20 μg/ml tryptophan. Eglu medium is ET without tryptophan. Transformants were selected on Luria-Bertani agar (33Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) supplemented with 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 12 μg/ml tetracycline. Nutrient broth was prepared according to the manufacturer's directions (Difco). Minimal agar and soft agar used in M13 assays was as described by Bebenek and Kunkel (31Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). HSV-tk selection medium is described by Eckert and Drinkwater (30Eckert K.A. Drinkwater N.R. Mutat. Res. 1987; 178: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Deoxynucleoside triphosphates, adenine triphosphate, and [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml) were purchased from New England Biolabs, Sigma, and AmershamBiosciences, respectively. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-d-galactoside (X-gal) and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine were purchased from Sigma. The oligonucleotides used in the preparation of the DNA substrates were synthesized at the Keck Molecular Biology Center at Yale University. The cDNAs of pol β-wt and T79S were subcloned into the pET28a vector (Novagen), 3′ to a hexahistidine tag, resulting in fusion of the tag to the N termini of the proteins. These enzymes were expressed and purified as described previously (34Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3851-3858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), using a fast protein liquid chromatography-driven Ni2+ column (Hi-Trap chelating resin,Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient. This was followed by Hi-Trap SP column (Amersham Biosciences) where the protein was eluted with a NaCl salt gradient. Proteins were greater than 90% homogenous based on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. Concentrations of pol β proteins were based on an ε280 = 21,200 m−1cm−1 and a molecular mass of 40 kDa for His-tagged pol β. The T79S mutant was identified in a genetic screen developed in our laboratory to isolate pol β mutator mutants (27Washington S.L. Yoon M.S. Chagovetz A.M., Li, S. Clairmont C.A. Preston B.D. Eckert K.A. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We used the Trp+ reversion screen to identify the mutator mutants from a library of random mutants constructed between nucleotides 1 and 300; this fragment encodes amino acids 1–100 of pol β. The library was constructed by mutagenic PCR and subcloning, as described (27Washington S.L. Yoon M.S. Chagovetz A.M., Li, S. Clairmont C.A. Preston B.D. Eckert K.A. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In our genetic screen, mutator mutants induce significantly more Trp+ revertants than cultures containing the pol β wild-type gene. The mutation of each pol β mutant was identified by the dideoxy DNA sequencing method using Sequenase 2.0 (United States Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturer's directions. To confirm that T79S was a mutator mutant, we compared the spontaneous mutation frequencies of pol β-wt and the T79S mutant in E. coli as described (27Washington S.L. Yoon M.S. Chagovetz A.M., Li, S. Clairmont C.A. Preston B.D. Eckert K.A. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The mutation frequency was calculated by dividing the number of Trp+ colonies by the total number of colonies (27Washington S.L. Yoon M.S. Chagovetz A.M., Li, S. Clairmont C.A. Preston B.D. Eckert K.A. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Sweasy J.B. Yoon M.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The DNA substrates employed in the biochemical assays described below are displayed in Fig. 2. The primer oligonucleotides were gel-purified as described (34Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3851-3858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and were radiolabeled at the 5′ end by standard methods using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP. The oligonucleotides were annealed at a primer:template molar ratio of 1:1.2 in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl. The mixture was incubated sequentially at 95 °C for 5 min, slow cooled to 50 °C for 30 min, and 50 °C for 20 min and then immediately transferred to ice. Annealing of primer was confirmed on an 18% polyacrylamide native gel followed by autoradiography as described (28Li S. Vaccaro J. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in which radiolabeled gapped DNA (300 nm 45X-22-22) was in 3-fold excess relative to pol β (100 nm). These reactions are referred to as burst experiments (29Shah A.M., Li, S.-X. Anderson K.S. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10824-10831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The burst experiment was performed at saturating concentrations of dNTP while minimizing any enzyme inhibition, which may occur with excess dNTP. Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of the pol β·DNA and Mg·dNTP solutions (final concentration of MgCl2 = 10 mm). At selected time intervals, the reactions were quenched with 0.3m EDTA. The reaction products were separated as described below. To elucidate the relative ability of the T79S enzyme compared with pol β-wt to incorporate correct and incorrect dNTPs into a primer-template, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constant for dNTP binding,K d, and the maximum rate of polymerization,k pol, for correct and incorrect dNTPs for each enzyme. For both pre-steady-state and single turnover condition assays, reactions were conducted in buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaCl, and 10% glycerol. All concentrations given refer to the final concentrations after mixing. The kinetics of correct dNTP incorporation were determined under single turnover conditions using rapid chemical quench performed on a KinTek Instruments model RQF-3 rapid quench-flow apparatus (36Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) thermostatted at 37 °C. Single turnover kinetic experiments were performed under conditions where the enzyme concentration greatly exceeds the K d value for gapped DNA. Single turnover conditions were determined empirically to be a ratio of enzyme to DNA of 15:1 (data not shown) for T79S. These conditions allow binding of greater than 95% of the DNA substrate by pol β and thereby measure the rate of a single catalytic turnover of the enzyme. Reactions were conducted at 37 °C in 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mmNaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 50 nm32P-end-labeled primer-template (45X-22-22) and 750 nm enzyme (both pol β-wt and T79S). Typically, experiments were carried out by loading 15 μl of the pol β-primer-template complex in buffer in one sample loop and 15 μl of a single dNTP in the second sample loop. Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of the two reactant solutions and were quenched at various times with 0.5 m EDTA. For correct incorporation reactions, substrate concentrations were typically 0–200 μm for single base gap or 0–1 mm for 3′-recessed DNA substrate, and reaction times were 0–5 s. The kinetics of misincorporation were determined manually under the above single turnover conditions. Reactions were performed by preincubating 750 nm enzyme with 50 nmprimer-template at 37 °C for 1 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate, incubated for the indicated reaction times, and stopped by the addition of 0.5 m EDTA. For incorrect incorporations, substrate concentrations were typically 0–2 mm, and reaction times were 0–2700 s. The reactions resulted in the addition of one dNTP onto the primer. Then (unextended) and n + 1 (extended by one nucleotide) DNA products were resolved on a 20% Sequel NE (American Bioanalytical) polyacrylamide gel. The bands were quantified by anAmersham Biosciences Storm 840 PhosphorImager to measure product formation as a function of time. The data were fit by nonlinear regression using the program Sigmaplot version 4.14 (Jandel Scientific). The data from burst experiments were fit to the equation [product] = A × (1 − exp(−k obs t)) + k ss t, where A is the amplitude of the burst; k obs is observed first-order rate constant for dNTP incorporation, andk ss is the observed steady-state rate constant. Single turnover kinetic data were fit to the single exponential equation [product] = A(1 − exp(−k obs t)), where A is the amplitude, and k obs is the observed first-order rate constant for dNTP incorporation. To obtainK d, the equilibrium dissociation constant, andk pol, the maximum rate of polymerization, the data were fit to the hyperbolic equation k obs =k pol[dNTP]/(K d + [dNTP]). Fidelity values were calculated using the following equation, fidelity = ((k pol/K d)correct + (k pol/K d)incorrect)/(k pol/K d)incorrect. These assays were performed as described above, in single turnover conditions, except the primer-template contained mispaired termini (35T-20G). The insertion of the next correct nucleotide, dGTP, was measured. The fidelity of pol β-wt and T79S was measured using two M13mp2-derived templates, each of which contain a 390-bp gap opposite the lacZ gene and were constructed as described (31Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). For gap-filling DNA synthesis, 0.1 pmol of gapped DNA was incubated with 20 pmol of rat pol β-wt or T79S in 30 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 500 μm dNTPs at 37 °C for 1 h at 37 °C, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 15 mm. An aliquot of each reaction was analyzed on a 0.8% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide to be certain that the gap was filled completely (31Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In each case, the reaction products comigrated with a double-stranded nicked molecular size standard, indicating that the gap had been filled to completion within our limits of detection (90%). Aliquots of each reaction were then transfected into the MC1061 strain, and the polymerase-induced mutation frequency was calculated from the ratios of mutant (blue) and nonmutant (colorless) plaques on CHS50 F′ indicator E. colias described (31Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The T79S polymerase was used in the HSV-tk forward mutational assay as reported previously (37Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Vargo P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Opresko P.L. Sweasy J.B. Eckert K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The M13-tk template contains a portion of the HSV1-thymidine kinase gene. Products of DNA synthesis were purified, and the polymerase-synthesized strand was rescued by hybridization to a gapped heteroduplex molecule. Mutation frequency was calculated as described by Eckert et al. (37Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Vargo P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) after transfection into the FT334 strain. To ensure independence of selected mutant colonies for the mutational spectra, FT334 cells were aliquoted into multiple tubes containing VBA broth immediately after electroporation as described previously (37Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Vargo P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Opresko P.L. Sweasy J.B. Eckert K.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2111-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then plated separately on selective media. To determine mutation specificities, the DNA sequence of the MluI-EcoRV target region of each mutant was obtained at the Keck Molecular Biology Center at Yale University. Mutants selected from the same tube that contained identical mutations were not considered independent and were counted as one mutant. The HSV-tk mutant frequency was defined as the number of colonies resistant to both 40 μm 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol divided by the total number of chloramphenicol-resistant colonies and was calculated as described (37Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Vargo P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We found that some tk sequences contained more than one mutation. We considered mutational events to be single errors only if the mutations were greater than 15 bases apart. Multiple errors occurring within 15 bases were scored as one mutation, and frequencies were calculated as described (37Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Vargo P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The dissociation constantK D (DNA) was measured using a gel mobility shift assay (39Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35866-35872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One nucleotide gapped (45X-22-22) and 3′-recessed (45X-22) oligonucleotides were prepared and annealed as described above. Fifteen protein concentrations ranging from 4 μm to 0.25 nm, expected to bracket the K D, were incubated with 0.1 nm DNA that had been radiolabeled in buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 6 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After a 10-min incubation at 20 °C, samples were loaded onto a 6% acrylamide nondenaturing gel with the current running at 300 V. After loading, voltage was reduced to 150 V, and the gel was run for 1 h. Fractions bound were determined by PhosphorImager quantitation of the gel using an Amersham Biosciences Storm 840 PhosphorImager. The apparent dissociation constant,K D, was derived from Sigmaplot fitting of the fraction bound versus protein concentration with the equation, Y = ((m1 · x)/(x +K D)) + m3, where m1 is a scaling factor, and m3 is the apparent minimum Y value (39Kosa J.L. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35866-35872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Three oligonucleotides Oligo 1, Oligo 2, and Oligo 3 (Fig. 2) were annealed and labeled with [γ-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and reverse transcriptase. After precipitation in ethanol, the labeled oligonucleotides were dissolved in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and treated with uracil-DNA-glycosylase immediately before use. The uracil-DNA-glycosylase-treated substrate (10 pmol/assay) was incubated in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 with indicated amounts of polymerases at 25 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS (final 0.5%), and the unexcised dRP was stabilized by 100 mm NaBH4. After addition of an equal volume of the formamide/dye solution, the samples were resolved by electrophoresis in a 8 m urea-containing 20% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was subjected to autoradiography with an x-ray film and also scanned with a Fuji BAS PhosphorImager for quantitation. To confirm that the candidate T79S mutant (Fig.1) we identified in our genetic screen possessed a true mutator phenotype, we compared the spontaneous mutation frequencies of this mutant of the 8-kDa domain of pol β with that of the pol β-wt strain using the Trp+ reversion assay (27Washington S.L. Yoon M.S. Chagovetz A.M., Li, S. Clairmont C.A. Preston B.D. Eckert K.A. Sweasy J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We found that the T79S mutant has a spontaneous mutation frequency that is 8-fold higher than the pol β-wt strain. We purified the protein as described under “Experimental Procedures” (28Li S. Vaccaro J. Sweasy J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A pre-steady-state burst experiment to monitor dTTP incorporation was performed under conditions where 45X-22-22 DNA (Fig. 2) was in 3-fold excess of pol β. Fig. 3 demonstrates insertion of dTTP opposite A by T79S at 37 °C occurs via an initial fast phase (k obs = 3.782 s−1) followed by a slower, linear phase with a rate constant of 0.2536 s−1. The biphasic nature of T79S is similar to WT pol β (29Shah A.M., Li, S.-X. Anderson K.S. Sweasy J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10824-10831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6"
https://openalex.org/W1992176583,"CooA is the CO-sensing transcriptional activator from Rhodospirillum rubrum, in which CO binding to its heme prosthetic group triggers a conformational change of CooA that allows the protein to bind its cognate target DNA sequence. By a powerful in vivo screening method following the simultaneous randomization of the codons for two C-helix residues, 113 and 116, near the distal heme pocket of CooA, we have isolated a series of novel CooA variants. In vivo, these show very high CO-independent activities (comparable with that of wild-type CooA in the presence of CO) and diminished CO-dependent activities. Sequence analysis showed that this group of variants commonly contains lysine at position 116 with a variety of residues at position 113. DNA-binding analysis of a representative purified variant, L116K CooA, revealed that this protein is competent to bind target DNA withKd values of 56 nm for Fe(III), 36 nm for Fe(II), and 121 nm for Fe(II)-CO CooA forms. Electron paramagnetic resonance and electronic absorption spectroscopies, combined with additional mutagenic studies, showed that L116K CooA has a new ligand replacing Pro2 in both Fe(III) and Fe(II) states. The most plausible replacement ligand is the substituted lysine at position 116, so that the ligands of Fe(III) L116K CooA are Cys75 and Lys116 and those in the Fe(II) form are His77 and Lys116. A possible explanation for CO-independent activity in L116K CooA is that ligation of Lys116 results in a repositioning of the C-helices at the CooA dimer interface. This result is consistent with that repositioning being an important aspect of the activation of wild-type CooA by CO. CooA is the CO-sensing transcriptional activator from Rhodospirillum rubrum, in which CO binding to its heme prosthetic group triggers a conformational change of CooA that allows the protein to bind its cognate target DNA sequence. By a powerful in vivo screening method following the simultaneous randomization of the codons for two C-helix residues, 113 and 116, near the distal heme pocket of CooA, we have isolated a series of novel CooA variants. In vivo, these show very high CO-independent activities (comparable with that of wild-type CooA in the presence of CO) and diminished CO-dependent activities. Sequence analysis showed that this group of variants commonly contains lysine at position 116 with a variety of residues at position 113. DNA-binding analysis of a representative purified variant, L116K CooA, revealed that this protein is competent to bind target DNA withKd values of 56 nm for Fe(III), 36 nm for Fe(II), and 121 nm for Fe(II)-CO CooA forms. Electron paramagnetic resonance and electronic absorption spectroscopies, combined with additional mutagenic studies, showed that L116K CooA has a new ligand replacing Pro2 in both Fe(III) and Fe(II) states. The most plausible replacement ligand is the substituted lysine at position 116, so that the ligands of Fe(III) L116K CooA are Cys75 and Lys116 and those in the Fe(II) form are His77 and Lys116. A possible explanation for CO-independent activity in L116K CooA is that ligation of Lys116 results in a repositioning of the C-helices at the CooA dimer interface.

The presence of CO is sensed by CooA, and CO-bound CooA activates the transcription of a series of genes encoding the CO oxidation system inR. rubrum (1He Y. Shelver D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 120-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). CooA contains a heme prosthetic group, as do other sensors for gaseous molecules such as soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC),1FixL, DOS, and HemAT (2Marletta M.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 3Gilles-Gonzales M.A. Ditta G.S.

The heme moieties are directly involved in binding their respective effector molecules and thereby regulate the activity of the sensor proteins. In CooA, the signal of CO binding to the heme is transmitted to the DNA-binding domain, the consequence of which is a conformational change allowing CooA to bind its target DNA sequence.The crystal structure of Fe(II) CooA revealed a novel subunit-swapped N-terminal Pro2 as a heme ligand trans to His77in the homodimer (6Lanzilotta W.N.

Because the Fe(II) form of CooA is 6-coordinate and low spin, the CO-sensing mechanism of CooA necessarily involves the displacement of one of these two ligands. Nuclear magnetic resonance and time-resolved resonance Raman studies identified Pro2 and His77 as the displaced and retained ligands, respectively, in the Fe(II)-CO form of CooA (7Yamamoto K.

CooA is a redox sensor as well as a CO sensor because only the Fe(II) form of CooA is competent to bind the physiological effector, CO. Interestingly, CooA undergoes a redox-dependent ligand switch, in which Cys75 replaces His77 in the Fe(III) form (9Shelver D. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Chung S.Y. Roberts G.P. Reynolds M.F.

Although the physiological role and exact mechanism of the ligand switch is still elusive, this switch indicates that the position of the heme prosthetic group of CooA is highly flexible relative to surrounding protein matrix.CooA belongs to the family of transcriptional activators containing the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) (11Shelver D. Kerby R.L., He, Y. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2157-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to similar target DNA sequences, CooA and CRP exhibit similar overall topologies, in which each protein is a dimer and each monomer contains two functionally distinct domains (Fig. 1). The effector-binding domain of each protein binds its respective small molecule (CO for CooA, cAMP for CRP). The end result of effector binding to this domain is a precise repositioning of the DNA-binding domain, which allows each protein to bind its cognate target DNA sequence. The two domains are connected through a long α-helix (designated as C-helix) that also serves as a subunit dimerization interface (6Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Importantly, the comparison of the structure of effector (CO)-free CooA with that of effector (cAMP)-bound CRP (6Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.J. Nat. Struct.

Consistent with this concept, alterations of particular amino acids within the C-helices exert a variety of effects on the activity in CRP (12Cheng X. Kovac L. Lee J.C.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 16-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), another member of this transcriptional activator family. It is therefore our working hypothesis that CO binding to the heme of CooA alters the positioning of the C-helices and that this repositioning effectively transmits the effector-binding signal through the protein and leads to the reorganization of the DNA-binding domains.It is unknown how the displacement of Pro2 by CO might affect C-helix positioning as proposed above. Although the release of Pro2 from the heme iron by incoming CO triggers the sequential events that result in the activation of CooA, a variety of Pro2 variants including a 5-residue-deleted variant (ΔP3-I7 CooA) are CO-responsive (15Thorsteinsson M.V.

Consistent with this view, Gly117 on the C-helix is important for CO activation (16Youn H. Kerby R.L. Thorsteinsson M.V. Conrad M. Staples C.R. Serate J. Beack J. Roberts G.P. J. Biol.

In this report, we address a novel CooA variant that, in the absence of effector (CO), effectively mimics the active conformation of wild-type (WT) CooA in the presence of CO. A possible underlying mechanism behind such a novel phenotype is discussed from a structural viewpoint. Rhodospirillum rubrum, a photosynthetic bacterium, can grow with CO as a sole energy source.

Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar) observed a dimeric crystallographic structure of the N-terminal ATP-binding domain of yeast HSP90. Subsequently, they showed an ATP-dependent dimerization of the N-terminal domain independent of the C-terminal dimeric region (27Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 16: 4383-4392Crossref Google Scholar). Region B and Region C mediate dimerization of the HSP90 family proteins; Region B of one subunit is associated with Region C of another subunit in an antiparallel fashion (22Nemoto T. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Ota M. Takagi T. Yokoyama K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy showed that an HSP90 dimer consists of four linearly arranged globules (18Maruya M. Sameshima M. Nemoto T. Yahara I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the N- and C-terminal immunogenic sites (23Nemoto T. Sato N. Iwanari H. Yamashita H. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26179-26187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) were localized in the terminal and interior globules, respectively (28Nemoto T.K. Ono T. Kobayakawa T. Tanaka E. Baba T.T. Tanaka K. Takagi T. Gotoh T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5258-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To accomplish the molecular function of HSP90, each region may have additional roles that should be unveiled. For instance, although the ATP binding site has been localized toward the amino terminus of HSP90, ATP binding as well as elevated temperature bring about a profound conformational change that is not restricted to the ATP-binding domain (16Csermely P. Kajtar J. Hollosi M. Jalsoszky G. Holly S. Kahn C.R. Gergely Jr., P. Soti C. Mihaly K. Somogyi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1901-1997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Sullivan W.

Sameshima M. Nemoto T. Yahara I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When the concentration of HSP90 was lower than 1 μm, both ATP binding and elevated temperature induced an equivalent conformational change, converting HSP90 from a linear dimer into an O-ring-shaped structure (18Maruya M. Sameshima M. Nemoto T. Yahara I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when the concentration of HSP90 was sufficiently high, HSP90 self-oligomerized instead of formed O-ring-shaped molecules, probably through essentially identical interactions (29Yonehara M. Minami Y. Kawata Y. Nagai J. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2641-2645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Alteration of the regional interaction may be closely related to these conformational changes. In this connection, we recently proposed that the liberation of the N-terminal client-binding region from the middle suppressor region is the mechanism underlying the temperature-dependent activation of HtpG, an Escherichia coli homologue of mammalian HSP90 (30Tanaka E. Nemoto T.K. Ono T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5270-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our previous study on limited proteolysis of human HSP90α strongly suggested the existence of subregional structures within the three respective regions (23Nemoto T. Sato N. Iwanari H. Yamashita H. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26179-26187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Further structural and functional analyses on potential substructures presented difficulty because of limited information on regional functions in those days. We recently reported the regional structures and their interactions of HtpG (28Nemoto T.K. Ono T. Kobayakawa T. Tanaka E. Baba T.T. Tanaka K. Takagi T. Gotoh T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5258-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As a result, several characteristics of HtpG and HSP90 regions emerged, which provided the probes for investigation of the subregional structures of HSP90. In the present study, we investigated potential subregional structures in the three regions of HSP90 responsible for the regional interactions and further investigated the role of the regional interactions of HSP90in vivo by using budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that the intramolecular interaction between Regions A and B is indispensable for the in vivofunction of HSP90. Expression vector pQE9 and plasmid pREP4 were purchased from Qiagen Inc. (Chatsworth, CA), and low molecular weight and peptide markers were from Amersham Biosciences AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Nippon Gene (Tokyo, Japan). Talon metal affinity resin was obtained from CLONTECH Laboratories Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Trypsin (5,200 USP units/mg of protein), chymotrypsin (11000 Ac-Tyr-OEt-hydrolyzing units/mg of protein) andN a-acetyl-l-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone were purchased from Sigma. Yeast protein extraction reagent Y-PER was from Pierce. Bacterial strain BTH101 (F−, cya-99, araD139,galE15, galK16,rpsL1(Strr), hsdR2,mcrA1, mcrB1) and plasmids pKT25kanand pUT18Camp were generously provided by Drs. D. Ladant (Pasteur Institute, Paris, France) and L. Selig (Hybrigenics, S.A., Paris, France). All other reagents were of analytical grade. The DNAs encoding the full-length form of human HSP90α (31Yamazaki M. Tashiro H. Yokoyama K. Soeda E. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 3163-3170PubMed Google Scholar) and E. coli HtpG (32Bardwell J.C.A.

Yokoyama (Riken Life Science Center, Tsukuba, Japan) and E. A. Craig (University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, WI), respectively. Construction of the plasmids carrying the full-length form of HSP90α and HtpG tagged with a histidine hexamer, designated pH6HSP90α and pH6HtpG, respectively, and their regions (A or BC) were described previously (28Nemoto T.K.

Y1090(pREP4) was transformed with the plasmids and selected on Luria broth agar plates containing 50 μg/ml of ampicillin and 25 μg/ml of kanamycin. H6HSP90α, H6HtpG, and their truncated forms were expressed and purified by use of Talon affinity resin according to the manufacturer's protocol, except that 10 mm imidazole was added in the lysis/washing buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 m imidazole (pH 8.0) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol. Three amino acids within Region B were substituted with Ala in human HSP90α, E. coli HtpG, and yeast HSC82 by site-directed mutagenesis in combination with the DpnI degradation elimination of template DNA. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Leu477, Glu517, and Leu592 of human HSP90α (34Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Smale G. Lloyd D. Weber L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2615-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) are equivalent to the respective Leu416, Glu456, and Leu532 in E. coli HtpG (34Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Smale G. Lloyd D. Weber L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2615-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and to Leu453, Glu493, and Leu567 in yeast HSC82 (35Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Throughout the present study, we use the amino acid numbers of human HSP90α to refer to these three amino acids for simplicity. Minimal regions responsible for the interaction between Region A and Region B were determined by the bacterial two-hybrid system according the method of Karimova et al. (36Karimova G. Ullmann A. Ladant D. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 73-82PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA fragments encoding Region A of HSP90α and its truncated forms amplified by PCR were inserted into pKT25kan and designated pKT25-HSP90αA-(1–400), pKT25-HSP90α-(222–400), and so on (see Fig. 3 a). The DNA fragments carrying Region B of HSP90α and its truncated regions were amplified by PCR and inserted into pUT18Camp, designated pUT18C-HSP90αB-(401–618), pUT18C-HSP90α-(401–600), and so on (see Fig. 3 b). The complex formation between co-expressed recombinant proteins was quantified by β-galactosidase activity as described previously (36Karimova G. Ullmann A. Ladant D. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 73-82PubMed Google Scholar). Values were reported as means of three or four samples and expressed as percentages of that activity in the bacteria co-expressing nontruncated Region A and Region B (100%). Temperature sensitivity of yeast cells expressing mutated forms of yeast HSC82 was examined as described previously (37Kimura Y. Matsumoto S. Yahara I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 5CG2HIS (MATα ura3–52 lys2–801 amber ade2–101 ochre triple-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 hsc82::HIS3 hsp82::GAL1-HSP82::LEU2) is a strain whose endogenous HSC82 gene was disrupted and HSP82 gene was controlled with a GAL1 promoter (37Kimura Y. Matsumoto S. Yahara I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 242: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The strain forms colonies on SGal plates by the expression of HSP82 but not on S.D. plates. A DNA fragment encoding the full-length form of yeast HSC82 cut out with SfcI and blunt-ended was inserted into a blunt-ended BamHI site of the GPD promoter of a multicopy plasmid, pYO326GPD (38Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), designated pYO326GPD-HSC82. The colony formation was examined on S.D. plates at 25 or 37 °C for 3 days and 14 °C for 2 weeks following the introduction of pYO326GPD-HSC82. Transformants grew on both S.D. and SGal plates at 14–37 °C. Electrophoresis was performed at a polyacrylamide concentration of 12.5% in the presence of 0.1% SDS. In cases (see Figs. 1 and 2) where fine separation of proteins smaller than 20 kDa was required, the Tris-Tricine system at a polyacrylamide concentration of 10% was employed (39Nishihara J. Ishibashi T. Sakai M. Nishi S. Kumazaki T. Hatanaka Y. Tsuda S. Hikichi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Low molecular weight and peptide markers were used as references. For determination of the N-terminal sequences of proteolytic fragments, separated proteins in a polyacrylamide gel were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After having been stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, the excised bands were directly subjected to sequencing with a model 477A protein sequencer (PE Biosystems).Figure 2Limited proteolysis of Regions BC. a, histidine-tagged Regions BC of HSP90α (HSP90αBC; 50 μg/25 μl) was incubated for 6 h at 30 °C without (lane 1) or with 0.002, 0.006, 0.02, 0.06, 0.2, 0.6, and 2 μg (lanes 2–8) of trypsin that had been treated withN a-acetyl-l-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone. Thereafter, aliquots (5 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE using the Tris-Tricine system. Apparent molecular masses of major fragments are indicated on the left. M, molecular markers. N-terminal sequencing of the fragments were performed as in Fig. 1 a. b, tryptic peptides are aligned according to their N-terminal sequences and apparent molecular masses.

The cells were lysed with Y-Per at 2.5 ml/g cell precipitate. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed thereafter as described previously (23Nemoto T. Sato N. Iwanari H. Yamashita H. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26179-26187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). An anti-HSP90 monoclonal antibody, K41220 (10 μg/ml), was used as the first antibody. K41220 binds to human HSP90α and HSP90β with equal efficiency (23Nemoto T. Sato N. Iwanari H. Yamashita H. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26179-26187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It recognizes one of the most immunogenic regions of human HSP90α,291NKTKPIWTRNPDDI304(34Hickey E. Brandon S.E. Smale G. Lloyd D. Weber L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2615-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), of which two amino acids (underlined) are replaced in human HSP90β (283NKTKPLWTRNPSDI296) (40Rebbe N.F. Ware J. Bertina R.M. Modrich P. Sttafford D.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and yeast HSC82 (267NKTKPLWTRNPSDI280) (35Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) as described previously (23Nemoto T. Sato N. Iwanari H. Yamashita H. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26179-26187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as the second antibody at a 1:2500 dilution. Kaleidoscope prestained standard (Bio-Rad) was used as molecular markers. In order to estimate molecular configurations, recombinant proteins and their mixtures were subjected to PAGE on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel under nondenaturing conditions (41Nemoto T. Ota M. Ohara-Nemoto Y. Kaneko M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 227: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We found that elution buffers (i.e. 0.1 m imidazole (pH 8) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol for H6HtpG) did not interfere with the interaction between recombinant proteins. Accordingly, purified proteins were used without any further treatment in this study. Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature unless otherwise described. Separated proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Ovalbumin (45 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa as monomer, 132 kDa as dimer, and 198 kDa as trimer), and catalase (240 kDa) were used as references. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). We first performed limited proteolytic analysis of HSP90α. To make the interpretation simple, we here used the regions of HSP90α instead of the full-length form. Limited proteolysis of Region A with trypsin produced a limited number of proteolytic fragments (Fig.1 a). At the lowest trypsin concentration, the 52-kDa Region A was split into 15- and 40-kDa fragments (lanes 2–4). At moderate and higher trypsin concentrations, the respective 30-kDa (lanes 4–7) and 10-kDa (lanes 6–8) fragments appeared. The 40- and 10-kDa fragments had an N terminus identical to that of the intact form. The 15-kDa fragment had two adjacent N termini starting at Glu282 and Tyr284 (Table I). The 30- and 40-kDa fragments were also produced by limited proteolysis of the full-length HSP90α (23Nemoto T. Sato N. Iwanari H. Yamashita H. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26179-26187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), which implies that the proteolytic pattern is identical between the full-length form and Region A. Interestingly, the 40-kDa fragment was still blotted by an anti-HSP90 monoclonal antibody K41102, which recognizes residues 247–257, but the 30-kDa fragment was not blotted by it (23Nemoto T. Sato N. Iwanari H. Yamashita H. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26179-26187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 40- and 15-kDa fragments seemed to consist of amino acids 1–281/283 and 282/284–400, respectively, and the 30-kDa fragment was derived from the 40-kDa species by deletion of the highly charged region (Glu223–Lys283), as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 b.Table IN-terminal sequences of tryptic fragments of H6HSP90αAFragmentDetected amino acidsDeduced sequence40MRGSHHHHHH−12MRGSHHHHHH−330aaMixture of two peptides.RGSHHHHHH−12m ↓ −11rgshhhhhh−330baMixture of two peptides.RGS−12mrgshhhhh−415aaMixture of two peptides.YIDQEELNK283K ↓ 284YIDQEELNK29215baMixture of two peptides.EKYIDQEEL281K ↓ 282EKYIDQEEL29010GSHHHHHHGS−11r ↓−10gshhhhhhgs−1Amino acids in lowercase letters are derived from the N-terminal tag peptide.

The arrows indicate tryptic cleavage sites. An identical technique was applied to Region A (Met1–Arg336) of E. coli HtpG. A major tryptic site (Arg236–Asn237) and chymotryptic site (Trp234–Thr235) were identified (data not shown; see Fig. 7 a). Next we performed limited proteolysis on Region B. Unfortunately, Region B of HSP90α was not quantitatively recovered from the bacterial expression system employed, presumably because the recombinant protein was unstable. Hence, we expressed Glu401–Asp732, which consisted of Region B and Region C (designated as Regions BC). The 42-kDa Regions BC was split into several fragments including 14- and 27-kDa fragments at low trypsin levels (Fig. 2 a). At moderate trypsin concentrations, 6.5-, 20-, and 24-kDa fragments appeared. At higher concentrations, 8- and 19-kDa fragments accumulated. Among them, the 14-kDa fragment was the most resistant to a wide range of trypsin concentrations (lanes 2–6). N-terminal sequencing revealed that the 14-kDa fragment started at Asp621 (Table II), implying that the fragment corresponded to Region C, as expected. The N-terminal sequence of the 27-kDa fragment was identical to that of the original fragment, indicating that the 27-kDa entity represented Region B. The N termini of the 24-, 20- and 19-kDa fragments were Asn415, Leu447, and Leu459, respectively. Thus, the 27-kDa Region B was successively degraded at the N-terminal side into 24-, 20-, and 19-kDa fragments. In addition to the N-terminal truncation, an 8-kDa fragment was obtained by cleavage at the C-terminal side of 27-kDa Region B. Taken together, the 42-kDa Regions BC was initially split into the 27-kDa Region B and the 14-kDa Region C, and the former was further processed into smaller fragments at cleavages of Lys414-Asn415, Lys446-Leu447, Lys458-Leu459, or Lys546-Glu547 (Fig. 2 b). It should be noted that a 22-kDa fragment carrying the N-terminal two-thirds of Region B was observed upon limited proteolysis of the full-length form (23Nemoto T. Sato N. Iwanari H. Yamashita H. Takagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26179-26187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) but that such a species was not detected on proteolysis of Region B.Table IIN-terminal sequences of tryptic fragments of H6HSP90αBCFragmentDetected amino acidsDeduced sequence27MRGSHHHHHH−12mrgshhhhhh−324NLVKKXLEL414K ↓415NLVKKCLEL42321LGLXEDS446K ↓447LGIHEDS45319LSELLRYY458K ↓459LSELLRYY46614DNSTMGYMAA620R ↓621DNSTMGYMAA6308EGLELDEDEE546K ↓ 547EGLELDEDEE5566.5aaMixture of two peptides.MRGSHHHHH−12mrgshhhhhh−46.5baMixture of two peptides.HIYYITGET489K ↓ 490HIYYITGET498Amino acids in lowercase letters are derived from the N-terminal tag peptide.

The arrows indicate tryptic cleavage sites. Next we determined the minimal regions required for the interaction between Region A and Region B by using a bacterial two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig.3 a, an interaction between Region A and Region B was ascertained. This interaction reflects the intramolecular interaction of an intact molecule, as reported recently (28Nemoto T.K. Ono T. Kobayakawa T. Tanaka E. Baba T.T. Tanaka K. Takagi T. Gotoh T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5258-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). HSP90α-(222–400) and HSP90α-(289–400) (i.e.truncations from the N terminus to Phe221 and to Glu288, respectively) still possessed considerable binding activities. A further deletion up to Gly310 resulted in a loss of the binding. In contrast, even the smallest deletion (28 residues) from the C terminus of Region A caused complete loss of the activity. T"

To study the effect of localized Ca2+signals on the transcriptional activation of the c-fosoncogene, we stably expressed various c-fos β-lactamase reporter constructs in pituitary AtT20 cells. A significant, but heterogenous expression of c-fos β-lactamase was observed in unstimulated cells, and a further increase was observed using KCl depolarization, epidermal growth factor (EGF), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), and serum. The KCl response was almost abolished by a nuclear Ca2+ clamp, indicating that a rise in nuclear Ca2+ is required. In contrast, the basal expression was not affected by the nuclear Ca2+ clamp, but it was strongly reduced by nifedipine, a specific antagonist of l-type Ca2+ channels. Spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations, blocked by nifedipine, were observed in the cytosol but did not propagate to the nucleus, suggesting that a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ is sufficient for basal c-fos expression. Inactivation of the c-fos promoter cAMP/Ca2+ response element (CRE) had no effect on basal or stimulated expression, whereas inactivation of the serum response element (SRE) had the same marked inhibitory effect as nifedipine. These experiments suggest that in AtT20 cells spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations maintain a basal c-fos transcription through the serum response element.

Immediate early genes (IEGs),1 such as c-fos, function as a relay in this process; the transcription and protein levels of IEGs can be changed rapidly as a direct function of cellular signals. IEGs, which are mostly transcription factors, in turn control the expression of “late” responsive genes, which then modify the cellular functions (1Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev.

Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1997; 18: 183-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The c-fos gene includes in its promoter two major response elements that are targets of phosphorylation cascades, the cAMP/Ca2+response element (CRE) and the serum response element (SRE) (2Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 477-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). These two consensus sequences bind different transcription factors, the activities of which are modulated by Ca2+-dependent (11Ahn S. Riccio A. Ginty D.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 803-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) as well as Ca2+-independent phosphorylation (13Karin M. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The CRE, which is located ∼60 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site of the c-fos gene, is bound by a leucine zipper transcription factor, CREB (CRE binding protein) (14Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Following stimulation, CREB is phosphorylated on a critical residue, the serine 133. This phosphorylation allows CREB to recruit the transcriptional adapter CBP (CREB binding protein) and activates transcription of c-fos. Activation of various signaling pathways results in CREB phosphorylation, most notably the cAMP/PKA cascade, Ca2+ signaling acting via Ca2+-calmodulin kinases (CaMkinases), as well as the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases. A second Ca2+ responsive element in the c-fospromoter is the serum response element, SRE, which is located ∼310 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional initiation site of the c-fos gene (15Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). SRE binds the serum response factor (SRF) and its accessory factor TCF, the ternary complex factor. TCFs are encoded by a family of Ets proteins that includes Elk-1, SAP-1a, and SAP-2. Phosphorylation of SRF on serine residue 103 is crucial for it's transcriptional activity. This residue can be phosphorylatedin vitro by MAP kinases and CaMkinases. Therefore, as for CREB, the phosphorylation of SRF may implicate various signaling pathways including Ca2+ signaling cascades mediated by CaMkinase (16Misra R.P. Bonni A. Miranti C.K. Rivera V.M. Sheng M. Greenberg M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25483-25493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Johnson C.M. Hill C.S. Chawla S. Treisman R. Bading H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6189-6202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Physiological activation of transcription via the SRE is thought to occur predominantly following growth factor stimulation of MAP kinase cascades. Control of gene expression by changes in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) concentration nearly always involves changes in protein phosphorylation. Ca2+ signals can cause such changes directly via Ca2+-calmodulin-activated protein kinases, CaMkinases, or calcineurin, a Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase (6Finkbeiner S. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurobiol. 1998; 37: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 7Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2313-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). A study suggests that finely tuned Ca2+ signals triggered in restricted cellular domains may be able to activate processes that are selectively affecting c-fos gene transcription (5Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). An increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration can occur inside or outside of the nucleus. A cytosolic Ca2+ increase can activate CaMkinase II and/or calcineurin, which then translocate from their site of activation to the nucleus (8Heist E.K. Srinivasan M. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19763-19771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 7Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2313-2316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation by nuclear Ca2+ can occur by a direct binding on DREAM (downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator), a Ca2+ binding transcriptional repressor (9Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), or by the translocation of the Ca2+/calmodulin complex from the cytosol to the nucleus. This translocated complex will then activate a nuclear CaMkinase, such as CaMkinase IV (10Deisseroth K. Heist E.K. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1998; 392: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Based on the stimulus-secretion coupling concept proposed by W. W. Douglas, pioneering studies in the 1960s demonstrated the electrical excitability of endocrine cells of the pituitary, the pancreas, and the adrenal medulla, now termed neuroendocrine cells (18Douglas W.W. Rubin R.P. J. Physiol. 1961; 159: 40-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 19Douglas W.W. Nature. 1963; 197: 81-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Douglas W.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1968; 34: 453-474Crossref Scopus (796) Google Scholar). These early studies showed that voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were instrumental in the generation of action potentials in a neuroendocrine cell; depolarizing currents were indeed sodium (Na+) and Ca2+ influxes, whereas repolarization was achieved by potassium (K+). Later we demonstrated in neuroendocrine cells that a single action potential may cause a well defined intracellular Ca2+ signal, that those action potentials occur spontaneously and that they are controlled by somatostatin (21Schlegel W. Winiger B.P. Mollard P. Vacher P. Wuarin F. Zahnd G.R. Wollheim C.B. Dufy B. Nature. 1987; 329: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). A wealth of subsequent literature illustrates that the modulation of Ca2+ action potentials in neuroendocrine cells is a versatile signaling option utilized by most releasing factors and releasing modulators, but also by growth factors and other extracellular signals (34Mollard P., and Schlegel W. TEM 7, 361–365.Google Scholar). Activation or inhibition of neuroendocrine cell activity nearly always involves such modulation, which results in alterations of action potential frequency and/or rhythm. In addition, amplitude, duration, and intracellular propagation of action potential-linked Ca2+ signals are modulated as well. In summary, Ca2+ action potentials and the resulting intracellular Ca2+ transients are fundamental signaling units in neuroendocrine cells. Transcriptional control by Ca2+ has been investigated within the context of Ca2+ oscillations generated by intracellular mechanisms originally described in hepatocytes (22Woods N.M. Cuthbertson K.S. Cobbold P.H. Nature. 1986; 319: 600-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Such Ca2+ oscillations are produced following receptor-mediated phospholipase C (PLC) activation and the generation of the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). IP3 binds to the IP3 receptor at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces the release of Ca2+from the ER. This Ca2+ release from intracellular stores occur in many cell types including pituitary cells (23Stojilkovic S.S. Kukuljan M. Tomic M. Rojas E. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7713-7720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ oscillations may activate gene transcription in a manner dependent on their pattern, as demonstrated for the transcription factor nuclear factor AT (NF-AT), which is activated by a mechanism involving the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin (24Dolmetsch R.E., Xu, K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar,25Li W. Llopis J. Whitney M. Zlokarnik G. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1998; 392: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Action potential-linked Ca2+ transients most likely function also for the activation of gene transcription by mechanisms sensitive to frequency and rhythm of oscillatory Ca2+changes. To test this hypothesis, we used a single cell reporter gene approach (26Zlokarnik G. Negulescu P.A. Knapp T.E. Mere L. Burres N. Feng L. Whitney M. Roemer K. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 279: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) in order to link the observations on Ca2+transients in individual cells to gene transcription. Furthermore, at the single cell level Ca2+ signals can be selectively manipulated by microinjection of high molecular weight Ca2+chelators into specific compartments such as the nucleus. Here we show that Ca2+ transients driven by spontaneous action potentials in the pituitary cell line AtT20 sustain a basal transcriptional activity of the IEG c-fos through a mechanism that involves the SRE and does not require changes in nuclear Ca2+ concentration. The plasmid pBlack-b and the fluorescent substrate CCF-2 AM (CCF-2 acetoxymethyl esters) were purchased from Aurora Biosciences Corp. (San Diego, United States). Fluorescent calcium probes, Fura-2 AM (Fura-2 acetoxymethyl esters) and Fura-2 D70 (Fura-2 Dextran 70 kDa); calcium chelators, Bapta AM (Bapta acetoxymethyl esters), Bapta-D70 (Bapta Dextran 70 kDa), and Texas-Red D70 (TR-D70) were supplied by Molecular Probes (Lucerne, Switzerland). Nifedipine was purchased from Sigma (Buchs, Switzerland). We used the bacterial enzyme β-lactamase as a reporter gene. We already dispose of luciferase reporter constructs containing the c-fos promoter (27Susini S. Van Haasteren G., Li, S. Prentki M. Schlegel W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28van Haasteren G., Li, S. Ryser S. Schlegel W. Neuroendocrinology. 2000; 72: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The luciferase coding sequence from our reporter constructs was then excised by NocI and XbaI digestion and replaced by the β-lactamase coding sequence. For our experiments four different constructs were used. The first contains c-fos proto-oncogene for the region of the mouse, extending from −379 to +1073. This construct is called c-fos-βL and corresponds to the wild type c-fospromoter plus part of the gene (first exon and first intron). The second and third constructions contained one each a mutation inactivating the CRE (c-fos-ΔCRE-βL) or the SRE (c-fos-ΔSRE-βL) response elements. The last construction contained two mutations inactivating both the SRE and CRE response elements (c-fos-ΔSRE/CRE-βL). All these constructions are schematically presented in Fig. 5. Mutations were performed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick-Change mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Basel, Switzerland). The strategy of mutagenesis has already been described (5Hardingham G.E. Chawla S. Johnson C.M. Bading H. Nature. 1997; 385: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 27Susini S. Van Haasteren G., Li, S. Prentki M. Schlegel W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28van Haasteren G., Li, S. Ryser S. Schlegel W. Neuroendocrinology. 2000; 72: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Rat corticotrope AtT20 cells were cultured in a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Stably transfected AtT20 clones (see below) were selectively maintained with 100 μg/ml G418 (an antibiotic analog to neomycin) added to the culture medium. For all measurements cells were plated on 25 mm coverslips, and serum was removed from the culture medium 24 h before experiments. Five stable AtT20 cell lines were established, four cell lines containing a reporter construct plasmid (c-fos-βL, c-fos-ΔCRE-βL, c-fos-ΔSRE-βL, c-fos-ΔSRE/CRE-βL) and one cell line with viral promoter SV40 (SV40-βL). A pcDNA3 vector containing the neomycin resistance gene co-transfected in a mass ratio of 1:10 was used for selection. The DOSPER liposomal transfection reagent (Roche) was used following the manufacturer's recommendations. The cotransfection was performed as follows. AtT20 cells were grown to ∼60% confluence in 35 mm diameter Petri dishes. After removal of the culture medium and one wash with HBS (Hepes buffer saline, pH 7.4), cells were incubated with 2 ml of HBS containing the plasmids (0.5 μg of pcDNA3 and 5 μg of reporter plasmid) dissolved previously in 40 μl of DOSPER. After 6 h, cells were washed with HBS, and culture was continued in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-F12 (10% fetal calf serum) containing 400 μg/ml G418. After 3 weeks of culture in G418 medium, several neomycin-resistant clones were selected and tested for their ability to induce fluorescence changes in CCF-2 in response to stimulation by 20 mm KCl and 3 μm cpt-cAMP (chlorophenylthio-cyclic AMP). AtT20 cells were injected using an Eppendorf transjector 5246 mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV microscope. For the measurements of nuclear Ca2+, the injection solution was 50 μm Fura 2-D70, half-strength phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2. For the nuclear-Ca2+ clamp, 2.5 mm Bapta-D70 and 1 mm Ca2+ were added (free Ca2+concentration was calculated to be 83 nm). To measure the β-lactamase activity, Fura 2-D70 was replaced by 5% TR-D70 as injection marker. After injection, cells were kept in the incubator at 37 °C for 4 to 5 h before experiments. Cytosolic calcium concentration variations were measured using the calcium probe Fura-2. Cells were loaded for 30 min at room temperature with the membrane permeant Fura-2 AM in a medium containing NaCl 140 mm, KCl 5 mm, Ca2+ 1.2 mm, MgCl21 mm, glucose 10 mm, Hepes 20 mm,pH 7.4. Changes of nuclear calcium concentration were measured by nuclear injection of the 70-kDa Dextran conjugate Fura-2 (Fura-2-D70; see “Microinjection” under “Experimental Procedures”). Fura-2 fluorescence (excitation 340/380 nm, emission 510 nm) was monitored with an imaging system. Loaded cells plated on coverslips were mounted on an inverted Zeiss Axiovert S100TV microscope coupled to a Princeton Instruments cooled back-illuminated frame-transfer charge-coupled device camera. The light source for illumination came from a Xenon XBO 75-W lamp. Excitation wavelengths were selected with a PTI (Photon Technology International) monochromator. Images were acquired with the Metamorph 4.1 software (Universal Imaging Corp.). Measurements were performed at 37 °C in an open perfusion micro-incubator (Harward Apparatus). The cytosolic and nuclear calcium (Ca2+) concentrations were determined as described (29Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). AtT20 cells cultured on 25 mm coverslips were loaded with the fluorescent substrate CCF-2AM as described (26Zlokarnik G. Negulescu P.A. Knapp T.E. Mere L. Burres N. Feng L. Whitney M. Roemer K. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 279: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in culture medium with 1 μm CCF-2AM and 1% pluronic acid. Cells were then washed in the perfusion chamber of the imaging system (as described before for Ca2+measurements). Measurements were made at 37 °C. CCF-2 fluorescence (excitation 405 nm) was imaged alternatively at emission wavelengths 450/530 nm, and data were stored at 3-min intervals. From these raw data in the form of image series at the two wavelengths, the fluorescence emission ratios F(450 nm)/F(530 nm) integrated over the cell area ratio were calculated (Fig. 1). The maximum and minimum CCF-2 ratios were determined by measuring the fluorescence in non-transfected AtT20 cells and in the SV40-βL cell line. The minimum ratio for the CCF-2 fluorescence was 0.48 ± 0.02 (n = 84 non-transfected cells). The maximal CCF-2 ratio was 6.5 ± 0.1 (n = 61 SV40-βL cells). These values are indicated in Fig. 1 (minimum and maximum) and Fig. 5 (minimum only) as dotted lines. To visualize the activation of gene transcription at the single cell level, we used β-lactamase as a reporter gene (26Zlokarnik G. Negulescu P.A. Knapp T.E. Mere L. Burres N. Feng L. Whitney M. Roemer K. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 279: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Expression of this bacterial enzyme can easily be detected by monitoring the fluorescence of a cell-permeant substrate, CCF-2, composed of two fluorophores linked by a β-lactame ring. The uncleaved CCF-2 emits green light (530 nm) because of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the two fluorophores. Upon β-lactamase expression, the substrate is cleaved and emits blue light (450 nm) because of the loss of FRET. β-lactamase activity is then measured as the change in green to blue CCF-2 fluorescence. To assess c-fos transcription, the β-lactamase coding sequence was placed under control of the promoter and first intron of the c-fos gene, yielding the reporter construct c-fos-βL that is drawn schematically in Fig. 5. Our earlier studies had shown that the first intron of the c-fos gene contains important regulatory elements without which transcription control by Ca2+ is incomplete (27Susini S. Van Haasteren G., Li, S. Prentki M. Schlegel W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,28van Haasteren G., Li, S. Ryser S. Schlegel W. Neuroendocrinology. 2000; 72: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We generated AtT20 cell clones stably expressing c-fos-βL, which were loaded with CCF-2 AM. As seen in Fig. 1 (left panels), stimulation of the CCF-2-loaded c-fos-βL cells with agonists induced a change in the color of CCF-2 fluorescence from green to blue within 15–20 min. The degree of β-lactamase expression was quantified as the ratio of blue (450 nm) to green (530 nm) fluorescence intensities, an increase in CCF-2 ratio (F450/F530) thus reporting c-fos-βL activation. Following cell stimulation, CCF-2 fluorescence images were acquired every 3 min, and CCF-2 ratios were calculated to obtain a time course of c-fos-βL transcriptional activation (Fig. 1, right panels). In the absence of any stimulation, no change in CCF-2 ratio could be detected (top right panel), indicating that the degree of basal c-fos-βL transcriptional activation was stable in AtT20 cells over the 2-h measurement period. In contrast, c-fos-βL reporter expression was markedly enhanced by stimuli known to activate transcription of the c-fos gene in AtT20 cells (Fig. 1, middle and lower panels), such as EGF (20 nm), PACAP (20 nm), and FCS (10%). All stimuli induced a strong change in the CCF-2 ratio, from a mean basal value of 1.8 ± 0.06 (± S.E.) to maximal values after 2 h of stimulation. Other values were 5.4 ± 0.8 for EGF, 4.13 ± 0.1 for PACAP and 4.6 ± 0.1 for serum. These results validate the use of c-fos-βL as a reporter gene, which has the advantage of resolving the kinetics of transcriptional activation of the c-fos gene at the single cell level. To study the effect of Ca2+ on c-fostranscription, cells were depolarized with 20 mm KCl in order to open voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VOCs) and trigger Ca2+ influx. As shown in Fig.2, KCl depolarization also powerfully activated c-fos-βL transcription, causing a near doubling in the CCF-2 ratio after 2 h of stimulation. This increase was almost completely abolished by preloading the cells with the Ca2+-chelator BAPTA-AM (Fig. 2, bottom panel), confirming that the KCl response was mediated by an increase in cellular Ca2+. Thus, in AtT20 cells a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ strongly activates the transcription of the c-fos gene. Although the basal CCF-2 ratio remained stable for up to 2 h in the absence of exogenous stimulus (Fig. 1), there was considerable cell-to-cell heterogeneity among non-stimulated cells (cf. the time 0′ images in Figs. 1 and 2). This suggested that c-fos-βL might already be activated in a fraction of the resting AtT20 cells. Accordingly, the histogram distribution of the CCF-2 ratios could be separated into three subpopulations centered at ratio values of 0.7, 1.8, and 3.5, and comprising 29%, 59%, and 12% of resting c-fos-βL AtT20 cells, respectively (Fig.3 A). This suggested that in the absence of stimulation transcription was strongly repressed in only approximately one-third of the cell population, whereas c-fos-βL was transcribed at intermediate levels in 59% of cells and at high levels in 12% of cells. Interestingly, the ratio value of the “active” population (3.5) was similar to the average CCF-2 ratio measured upon KCl stimulation (Fig. 3 C), suggesting that c-fos transcription was fully activated in 12% of unstimulated cells. To assess whether this heterogeneity could reflect spontaneous Ca2+ transients caused by the basal electrical activity of AtT20 cells, we used thel-type Ca2+ channel inhibitor, nifedipine. Exposure of cells to 1 μm nifedipine for 4 h, a concentration that completely blocks l-type Ca2+ channels, shifted the CCF-2 ratio to lower values, leaving nearly no transcriptionally fully active cells (Fig.3 B). Most cells (61%) now displayed a CCF-2 ratio of 0.8, and the proportion of cells with intermediate c-fos-βL activity (1.6) was reduced to 34%. An opposite effect was observed with a 2-h KCl stimulation (Fig. 3 C); the proportion of cells with fully activated c-fos-βL increased from 12 to 69% (ratio 3.64), whereas intermediate c-fos-βL activity was observed in the remaining 31% of cells (ratio 2.26). Thus, in AtT20 cells, basal c-fos transcription is relatively high as a result of electrical activity. Ca2+ channel blockers strongly down-regulate this endogenous activity, whereas a long-lasting depolarization powerfully activates c-fos transcription. Spontaneous action potentials in pituitary cells generate characteristic Ca2+ transients (21Schlegel W. Winiger B.P. Mollard P. Vacher P. Wuarin F. Zahnd G.R. Wollheim C.B. Dufy B. Nature. 1987; 329: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 30Guerineau N. Corcuff J.B. Tabarin A. Mollard P. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Fiekers J.F. Konopka L.M. Cell Calcium. 1996; 19: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These Ca2+ elevations could be readily measured in c-fos-βL AtT20 cells using the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator fura-2 (Fig.4). As observed for basal c-fos-βL activity, the Ca2+ activity was heterogenous. 87% of cells (55/63) exhibited Ca2+transients with mean amplitude and frequency of 118 ± 87 nm and 0.1 ± 0.04 Hz, respectively (mean ± S.D., n = 1622, Fig. 4 A), whereas 13% of cells (8/63) lacked electrical activity (not shown). The Ca2+ transients ranged from 30 nm to 400 nm, resembling the distribution of basal c-fos-βL activity (Fig. 4 C). As expected, the spontaneous Ca2+ activity was completely abolished by the addition of 1 μm nifedipine (n = 19, Fig.4 C). Stimulation by 20 mm KCl elicited a transient increase in the cytosolic Ca2+, to 630 ± 200 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 7, Fig.4 D), followed by a sustained plateau (200 ± 70 nm). Note the disappearance of the spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations during the KCl stimulation. The convergent effect of nifedipine on basal Ca2+ transients and c-fos-βL activity suggested an important role for the spontaneous Ca2+ transients in the regulation of gene expression. To assess which element within the c-fos promoter mediated this Ca2+ response, we separately mutated two Ca2+ response elements within the c-fos-βL promoter (SRE and CRE, Fig. 5 A). The CRE and SRE elements were inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis (see Experimental Procedures), and AtT20 clones stably expressing the mutated constructs were established. These two clones (c-fos-ΔCRE-βL and c-fos-ΔSRE-βL) also displayed spontaneous Ca2+ transients, with amplitude and frequency similar to those observed in c-fos-βL or wild type AtT20 cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5 B(hatched bars), deletion of the CRE element only marginally increased the basal CCF-2 ratio and did not affect the ability of cells to respond to nifedipine, but precluded their activation by KCl (2.69 ± 0.37 versus 2.15 ± 0.24,p = 0.07, unpaired t test). In contrast, deletion of the SRE element had a profound effect on endogenous c-fos-βL activity, decreasing the basal CCF-2 ratio from 1.80 ± 0.06 to 0.83 ± 0.03 (filled bars,p < 10−8, unpaired t test). Basal c-fos-ΔSRE-βL transcription could not be further reduced by nifedipine (0.80 ± 0.04), but the cells were still able to respond to a depolarizing stimulus. The ratio increased from 0.83 ± 0.03 to 2.07 ± 0.1 in the presence of KCl. The inactivation of both SRE and SRE elements (c-fos-ΔSRE/CRE-βL, Fig. 5 A) strongly reduced the expression of β-lactamase (dark bars), to values only slightly higher than the minimal values measured in non-transfected cells (dotted line). These cells were insensitive to nifedipine and to KCl stimulation. These data suggest that the CRE element is not required for the basal activation of c-fos. Instead, the SRE element appears to mediate the basal c-fostranscription driven by spontaneous action potentials. In contrast, the SRE element is less essential for the Ca2+-mediated transcriptional activation induced by a large and long-lasting depolarization. The differential regulation of the spontaneous and KCl-induced c-fos transcription suggested that the two types of Ca2+ signals might propagate differently to the nucleus. In particula"
https://openalex.org/W2009536539,"Previous studies have demonstrated that keratin K10 plays an important role in mediating cell signaling processes, since the ectopic expression of this keratin induces cell cycle arrest in proliferating cells in vitro and in vivo. However, apart from its well known function of providing epithelial cells with resilience to mechanical trauma, little is known about its possible roles in nondividing cells. To investigate what these might be, transgenic mice were generated in which the expression of K10 was driven by bovine K6β gene control elements (bK6βhK10). The transgenic mice displayed severe abnormalities in the tongue and palate but not in other K6-expressing cells such as those of the esophagus, nails, and hair follicles. The lesions in the tongue and palate included the cytolysis of epithelial suprabasal cells associated with an acute inflammatory response and lymphocyte infiltration. The alterations in the oral mucosa caused the death of transgenic pups soon after birth, probably because suckling was impaired. These anomalies, together with others found in the teeth, are reminiscent of the lesions observed in some patients with pachyonychia congenita, an inherited epithelial fragility associated with mutations in keratins K6 and K16. Although no epithelial fragility was observed in the bK6βhK10 oral epithelia of the experimental mice, necrotic processes were seen. Collectively, these data show that the carefully regulated tissue- and differentiation-specific patterns displayed by the keratin genes have dramatic consequences on the biological behavior of epithelial cells and that changes in the specific composition of the keratin intermediate filament cytoskeleton can affect their physiology, in particular those of the oral mucosa. Previous studies have demonstrated that keratin K10 plays an important role in mediating cell signaling processes, since the ectopic expression of this keratin induces cell cycle arrest in proliferating cells in vitro and in vivo. However, apart from its well known function of providing epithelial cells with resilience to mechanical trauma, little is known about its possible roles in nondividing cells.

The transgenic mice displayed severe abnormalities in the tongue and palate but not in other K6-expressing cells such as those of the esophagus, nails, and hair follicles. The lesions in the tongue and palate included the cytolysis of epithelial suprabasal cells associated with an acute inflammatory response and lymphocyte infiltration. The alterations in the oral mucosa caused the death of transgenic pups soon after birth, probably because suckling was impaired. These anomalies, together with others found in the teeth, are reminiscent of the lesions observed in some patients with pachyonychia congenita, an inherited epithelial fragility associated with mutations in keratins K6 and K16. Although no epithelial fragility was observed in the bK6βhK10 oral epithelia of the experimental mice, necrotic processes were seen. Collectively, these data show that the carefully regulated tissue- and differentiation-specific patterns displayed by the keratin genes have dramatic consequences on the biological behavior of epithelial cells and that changes in the specific composition of the keratin intermediate filament cytoskeleton can affect their physiology, in particular those of the oral mucosa. Keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) 1The abbreviations used are: KIF, keratin intermediate filament; hK, human keratin; mK, mouse keratin; bK, bovine keratin; AC, anterior column; BC, buttress column; PC, posterior column. 1The abbreviations used are: KIF, keratin intermediate filament; hK, human keratin; mK, mouse keratin; bK, bovine keratin; AC, anterior column; BC, buttress column; PC, posterior column. are present in the cytoplasm of all epithelial cells as heteropolymers of type I and type II keratin polypeptides. Type I and type II keratin genes display highly regulated expression patterns in a pairwise and differentiation-specific fashion (1Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4495) Google Scholar, 2Quinlan R.A. Schiller D.L. Hatzfeld M. Achtstatter T. Moll R. Jorcano J.L. Magin T.M. Franke W.W. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

The role of KIF in epithelial cells and tissues remained elusive until the discovery, through studies with transgenic mice and the finding of mutations affecting keratin proteins in dominantly inherited epithelial fragility syndromes (4Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 345-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 5Fuchs E. Cleveland D.W.

This appears to be a function shared by the majority of the keratin family. Therefore, the changes in keratin expression observed during differentiation (or in certain situations such as in tumor growth or wound healing involving stratified epithelia) probably indicate subtle, cell type-specific differences in function among these polypeptides. Further keratin-specific functions should not be discarded.Previous studies have demonstrated that K10 has specific functions. This keratin replaces K14 as skin keratinocytes enter the terminal differentiation program and become postmitotic (9Fuchs E.V. Green H. Cell. 1980; 19: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). In addition, K10 expression is severely reduced under hyperproliferative situations, such as in wound healing and epidermal tumors. We have previously demonstrated that forced K10 expression in cultured cells induces cell cycle arrest through a mechanism that requires a functional retinoblastoma gene (10Paramio J.M. Casanova M.Ll. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3086-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This process seems to take place by impairing the activation of Akt and protein kinase Cζ and leads to reduced cyclin D1 expression (10Paramio J.M. Casanova M.Ll. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B.

Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Moreover, ectopic human K10 (hK10) expression in the basal layer of the epidermis of transgenic mice (making use of the bovine basal keratin bK5 promoter (bK5hK10 mice)), also inhibits cell proliferation and dramatically impairs tumor development (12Santos M. Paramio J.M. Bravo A. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results indicate that K10 may play a role in the induction and/or maintenance of postmitotic status of suprabasal epidermal cells (10Paramio J.M. Casanova M.Ll. Segrelles C.

However, no evidence was provided of other functions of K10 in cells that normally do not dividein vivo but where this protein is normally expressed (9Fuchs E.V. Green H. Cell. 1980; 19: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). A way of exploring these possible functions is to express K10 ectopically in postmitotic suprabasal cells of transgenic mice.Keratin K6 (K6) is a type II keratin under elaborate control. It displays constitutive and inducible expression in various types of complex epithelia. K6 is constitutively expressed in the suprabasal cells of the paw pad and sole of the foot, the nail bed, esophagus, trachea, oral cavity, and the outer root sheath of the hair follicles (13Wojcik S.M.

In addition, K6 is induced after injury and in diseases involving altered proliferation or differentiation in humans and mouse skin epidermis (15Ramirez A. Vidal M. Bravo A. Larcher F. Jorcano J.L.

The complexity of K6 expression is further increased by the fact that there are six functional K6 genes in humans, three in mice (13Wojcik S.M. Longley M.A. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Rothnagel J.A. Seki T. Ogo M. Longley M.A. Wojcik S.M. Rundman D. Bickenbach J.R. Roop D.R.

The significance of this diversity is unclear. Finally, inherited mutations affecting the K6 genes in humans are associated with type I (23Bowden P.E. Haley J.L. Kansky A. Rothnagel J.A. Jones D. Turner R.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and type II (24Smith F.J. Jonkman M.F. van Goor H. Coleman C.M. Covello S.P. Uitto J. McLean W.H. Hum. Mol.

These genetic disorders are characterized by severe dystrophy of the nail plate and differ principally in the involvement of other stratified epithelia (6Irvine A.D. McLean W.H.I. Br. J. Dermatol. 1999; 140: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 19McGowan K.M. Coulombe P.A. Harris J.R. Herrmann H. Subcellular Biochemistry: Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Co., London1998: 141-165Google Scholar).The expression pattern of the K6 genes makes their regulatory regions appropriate to direct the expression of selected transgenes to stratified epithelia in transgenic mice (15Ramirez A. Vidal M. Bravo A. Larcher F. Jorcano J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4783-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Takahashi K. Coulombe P.A. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 14776-14781Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have previously reported two lines of transgenic mice expressing human keratin K10 (hK10) under the control of the bovine keratin K6β promoter (bK6βhK10 mice) (25Santos M. Ballestı́n C. Garcı́a-Martı́n R. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 20: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although they displayed no overt phenotype, a clear delay was found in tumor development when these mice were subjected to skin chemical carcinogenesis protocols (25Santos M. Ballestı́n C. Garcı́a-Martı́n R. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 20: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, this is a relatively minor effect compared with that observed in bK5hK10 transgenic mice, which are almost completely resistant to tumor development (12Santos M. Paramio J.M. Bravo A. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This difference is probably attributable to the expression of hK10 in different cell compartments. The three mK6 genes are normally absent from interfollicular epidermis, but they are rapidly induced upon hyperproliferative stimuli in suprabasal keratinocytes (13Wojcik S.M. Longley M.A. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Ramirez A. Vidal M. Bravo A. Larcher F. Jorcano J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Only one, namely mK6a, is expressed in the basal layer of the hyperproliferative epidermis (13Wojcik S.M. Longley M.A. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Wong P. Colucci-Guyon E. Takahashi K., Gu, C. Babinet C. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), where bK5 is expressed (26Ramirez A. Bravo A. Jorcano J.L. Vidal M. Differentiation. 1994; 58: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the bovine bK6β regulatory elements drive the expression of the transgene, similarly to the endogenous mK6b gene, in the suprabasal layers of the hyperproliferative epidermis (13Wojcik S.M. Longley M.A. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,15Ramirez A. Vidal M. Bravo A. Larcher F. Jorcano J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this compartment, the keratinocytes display a very limited proliferative activity compared with the basal layer cells. In addition, differences in the level of K10 expression may also contribute toward explaining the observed differences in tumorigenic susceptibility between bK5hK10 and bK6βhK10 transgenic mice. In support of this, heterozygous bK5hK10 mice do not display overt epidermal abnormalities, whereas hypoplasic and hyperkeratotic epidermises have been observed in homozygous bK5hK10 transgenic mice in parallel with increased expression of the transgene (12Santos M. Paramio J.M. Bravo A. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This is also in agreement with our observations demonstrating that the effects of keratin K10 are clearly related to its expression level (10Paramio J.M. Casanova M.Ll. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3086-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).In this work, we have tried to address the possible functions of K10 in nonproliferative cells by studying the consequences of hK10 expression in tissues normally expressing K6. As previously reported, bK6βhK10 animals display no obvious phenotype even in homozygosis; we have thus generated new bK6βhK10 transgenic mice lines bearing a higher copy number of the transgene in order to increase the expression of hK10 in those cells in which bK6β is active. In this context, it is important to point out that the bK6β promoter has an expression pattern very similar to the endogenous mouse keratin K6b (mK6b) (13Wojcik S.M. Longley M.A. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Wojcik S.M. Imakado S. Seki T. Longley M.A. Petherbridge L. Bundman D.S. Bickenbach J.R. Rothnagel J.A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar).All these high copy number transgenic mice display a clear phenotype that affects the oral mucosa and is characterized by the necrosis of the suprabasal cells of the tongue, palate, and gingival epithelium, in association with acute inflammation. This leads to severe shedding of the epithelium, causing perinatal death by impeding suckling. Alterations were also seen in the incisors, but no significant anomalies were observed in nails or hair. Our results indicate that the ectopic expression of K10 in postmitotic suprabasal cells provokes dramatic alterations in their biological behavior and indicate that alterations of the specific expression pattern of keratins in a given epithelium affect the physiological status of the tissue, providing clear evidence of the functional diversity of these proteins. Keratin intermediate filaments (KIFs) 1The abbreviations used are: KIF, keratin intermediate filament; hK, human keratin; mK, mouse keratin; bK, bovine keratin; AC, anterior column; BC, buttress column; PC, posterior column. 1The abbreviations used are: KIF, keratin intermediate filament; hK, human keratin; mK, mouse keratin; bK, bovine keratin; AC, anterior column; BC, buttress column; PC, posterior column. are present in the cytoplasm of all epithelial cells as heteropolymers of type I and type II keratin polypeptides. Type I and type II keratin genes display highly regulated expression patterns in a pairwise and differentiation-specific fashion (1Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R.

The role of KIF in epithelial cells and tissues remained elusive until the discovery, through studies with transgenic mice and the finding of mutations affecting keratin proteins in dominantly inherited epithelial fragility syndromes (4Fuchs E.

This appears to be a function shared by the majority of the keratin family. Therefore, the changes in keratin expression observed during differentiation (or in certain situations such as in tumor growth or wound healing involving stratified epithelia) probably indicate subtle, cell type-specific differences in function among these polypeptides. Further keratin-specific functions should not be discarded. Previous studies have demonstrated that K10 has specific functions. This keratin replaces K14 as skin keratinocytes enter the terminal differentiation program and become postmitotic (9Fuchs E.V. Green H.

In addition, K10 expression is severely reduced under hyperproliferative situations, such as in wound healing and epidermal tumors. We have previously demonstrated that forced K10 expression in cultured cells induces cell cycle arrest through a mechanism that requires a functional retinoblastoma gene (10Paramio J.M.

Turner R.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and type II (24Smith F.J. Jonkman M.F. van Goor H. Coleman C.M. Covello S.P. Uitto J. McLean W.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) pachyonychia congenita. These genetic disorders are characterized by severe dystrophy of the nail plate and differ principally in the involvement of other stratified epithelia (6Irvine A.D. McLean W.H.I. Br. J. Dermatol. 1999; 140: 815-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 19McGowan K.M. Coulombe P.A. Harris J.R. Herrmann H. Subcellular Biochemistry: Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Co., London1998: 141-165Google Scholar). The expression pattern of the K6 genes makes their regulatory regions appropriate to direct the expression of selected transgenes to stratified epithelia in transgenic mice (15Ramirez A. Vidal M.

We have previously reported two lines of transgenic mice expressing human keratin K10 (hK10) under the control of the bovine keratin K6β promoter (bK6βhK10 mice) (25Santos M. Ballestı́n C. Garcı́a-Martı́n R. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 20: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although they displayed no overt phenotype, a clear delay was found in tumor development when these mice were subjected to skin chemical carcinogenesis protocols (25Santos M. Ballestı́n C. Garcı́a-Martı́n R. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Carcinog. 1997; 20: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, this is a relatively minor effect compared with that observed in bK5hK10 transgenic mice, which are almost completely resistant to tumor development (12Santos M. Paramio J.M. Bravo A. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This difference is probably attributable to the expression of hK10 in different cell compartments. The three mK6 genes are normally absent from interfollicular epidermis, but they are rapidly induced upon hyperproliferative stimuli in suprabasal keratinocytes (13Wojcik S.M. Longley M.A. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 15Ramirez A. Vidal M. Bravo A. Larcher F. Jorcano J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Only one, namely mK6a, is expressed in the basal layer of the hyperproliferative epidermis (13Wojcik S.M. Longley M.A. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Wong P. Colucci-Guyon E. Takahashi K., Gu, C. Babinet C. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), where bK5 is expressed (26Ramirez A. Bravo A. Jorcano J.L. Vidal M. Differentiation. 1994; 58: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the bovine bK6β regulatory elements drive the expression of the transgene, similarly to the endogenous mK6b gene, in the suprabasal layers of the hyperproliferative epidermis (13Wojcik S.M. Longley M.A. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,15Ramirez A. Vidal M. Bravo A. Larcher F. Jorcano J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this compartment, the keratinocytes display a very limited proliferative activity compared with the basal layer cells. In addition, differences in the level of K10 expression may also contribute toward explaining the observed differences in tumorigenic susceptibility between bK5hK10 and bK6βhK10 transgenic mice. In support of this, heterozygous bK5hK10 mice do not display overt epidermal abnormalities, whereas hypoplasic and hyperkeratotic epidermises have been observed in homozygous bK5hK10 transgenic mice in parallel with increased expression of the transgene (12Santos M. Paramio J.M. Bravo A. Ramirez A. Jorcano J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19122-19130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This is also in agreement with our observations demonstrating that the effects of keratin K10 are clearly related to its expression level (10Paramio J.M. Casanova M.Ll. Segrelles C. Mittnacht S. Lane E.B. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3086-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Paramio J.M. Segrelles C. Ruiz S. Jorcano J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7449-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this work, we have tried to address the possible functions of K10 in nonproliferative cells by studying the consequences of hK10 expression in tissues normally expressing K6. As previously reported, bK6βhK10 animals display no obvious phenotype even in homozygosis; we have thus generated new bK6βhK10 transgenic mice lines bearing a higher copy number of the transgene in order to increase the expression of hK10 in those cells in which bK6β is active. In this context, it is important to point out that the bK6β promoter has an expression pattern very similar to the endogenous mouse keratin K6b (mK6b) (13Wojcik S.M. Longley M.A. Roop D.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Wojcik S.M. Imakado S. Seki T. Longley M.A. Petherbridge L. Bundman D.S. Bickenbach J.R. Rothnagel J.A.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All these high copy number transgenic mice display a clear phenotype that affects the oral mucosa and is characterized by the necrosis of the suprabasal cells of the tongue, palate, and gingival epithelium, in association with acute inflammation. This leads to severe shedding of the epithelium, causing perinatal death by impeding suckling. Alterations were also seen in the incisors, but no significant anomalies were observed in nails or hair. Our results indicate that the ectopic expression of K10 in postmitotic suprabasal cells provokes dramatic alterations in their biological behavior and indicate that alterations of the specific expression pattern of keratins in a given epithelium affect the physiological status of the tissue, providing clear evidence of the functional diversity of these proteins.
