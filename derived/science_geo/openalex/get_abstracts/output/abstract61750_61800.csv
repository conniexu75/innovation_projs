https://openalex.org/W2086745277,"IN spite of much speculation on the matter, the aetiology of left-handedness remains elusive. Investigators have considered heredity, neurological pathology, imitation and negative personality, but the evidence in support of any particular hypothesis is inconclusive. There are, however, some suggestive facts. The frequency of left-handedness is greater in males and in twin births, both of which are also associated with greater birth and infant mortality and, in the case of males, a higher rate of spontaneous abortion. The pre-natal and peri-natal periods seem to be more stressful for these groups. Left-handedness is also associated with language disorders such as stuttering, dyslexia, and mental retardation, conditions where central nervous system pathology may be implicated1. This suggests that the incidence of left-handedness might be correlated with stressful pre-natal and birth conditions. Such difficulties are most characteristic of primiparous births (longer labour and more use of instruments) and births to older mothers. Thus high risk birth orders would be the first born and the late-born (defined here as fourth or later birth)."
https://openalex.org/W2064391832,"THE principal oestrogen secreted by the ovary of the non-pregnant ewe is 17β-oestradiol1. After continuous infusion of 3H-17β-oestradiol into both pregnant and non-pregnant sheep, oestrone and 17α-oestradiol have been isolated from blood as the chief unconjugated radiometabolites2,3. In pregnancy, oestrogens are excreted in urine as oestrone and 17α-oestradiol conjugates4, but calculation of blood steroid concentration from these data4 and from the metabolic clearance rate of 17β-oestradiol2 suggested that the circulating concentration of 17β-oestradiol in the pregnant sheep would be extremely small (<20 pg/ml. of plasma). Measurements, therefore, of this steroid in circulating blood of the sheep have not been reported, and the role of oestrogens in late pregnancy and parturition has not been defined clearly. Because a decreasing progesterone block on the myometrial contractile response to oxytocin cannot always account for the onset of parturition5, it has become increasingly important to establish any significant changes in oestrogen biosynthesis in late pregnancy. I wish to report a rapid ten-fold increase in the maternal circulating oestrogen on the day before parturition in the sheep, which could provide a positive trigger for the onset of labour."
https://openalex.org/W2077520688,"A cytoplasmic enzyme from guinea pig brain was shown to transfer methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to only one of 19 arginine residues in the basic protein from human brain. The products were omega-N-monomethylarginine and omega-N,N'-dimethylarginine. These methylated arginines are adjacent to the main encephalitogenic determinant in the protein. Methylation may aid in the transfer of this region of the protein into the nonpolar environment within myelin and in maintaining the integrity of myelin."

https://openalex.org/W2090076830,"PSYCHOSIS can be induced by the administration of large doses of amphetamine1 and some of its derivatives2. In man, a principal metabolite of amphetamine is p-hydroxyamphet-amine. Biological O-methylation of this compound would yield a potent hallucinogen, p-methoxyamphetamine (PMA)3. In a previous report4, we demonstrated that within the limit of detectability of PMA (about 80 µg/24 h urine) by a sensitive procedure employing gas chromatography of the acetyl derivative, PMA was not detected in the urine of four subjects to whom amphetamine sulphate was administered in large doses (mean of 629 mg) over an average period of 51 h. These subjects developed varying degrees of psychotic symptomatology."

https://openalex.org/W2004484304,Certain synthetic homo- and copolyribonucleotide polymers are capable of releasing the DNA template restriction of isolated nuclei of rat liver cells when assayed with an excess of or in the absence of exogenous DNA polymerase. The purine homopolyribonucleotides are far more effective than are the pyrimidine polymers.

https://openalex.org/W1507911824,"Abstract Chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase catalyzes the first two reactions specific for phenylalanine synthesis in Salmonella typhimurium. Both activities are subject to feedback inhibition by phenylalanine. Experiments with modifying reagents (bromopyruvate and p-mercuribenzoate), a product analogue (2,4-dihydroxybenzoate), and mutationally altered enzymes provide evidence for functionally distinct catalytic sites and a regulatory site distinct from the catalytic sites. The following evidence argues for functionally distinct sites for chorismate mutase and prephenate dehydratase activities. (a) Treatment with bromopyruvate or p-mercuribenzoate selectively inactivates prephenate dehydratase. (b) Prephenate dehydratase is selectively inhibited by 2,4-dihydroxybenzoate. (c) A mutant enzyme from a phenylalanine auxotroph is found to lack prephenate dehydratase activity while retaining chorismate mutase activity. A regulatory site for phenylalanine distinct from the catalytic sites is suggested by the following. (a) Treatment of chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase with bromopyruvate or p-mercuribenzoate desensitizes chorismate mutase to inhibition by phenylalanine. (b) A mutant chorismate mutase-prephenate dehydratase isolated from a 4-fluorophenylalanine-resistant strain is insensitive to inhibition by phenylalanine. It is suspected that this enzyme still binds phenylalanine because of its affinity for phenylalanine-substituted Sepharose. Other experiments, however, suggest some relationship between the catalytic site for prephenate dehydratase and a regulatory site for phenylalanine."

The nucleic acid-membrane complex may be detected by centrifugation in cesium chloride density gradients. The density of the nucleic acid-membrane complex and, in certain cases, the amount of nucleic acid associated with the membrane was changed in the presence of various carcinogenic chemicals."

https://openalex.org/W1582957817,"A study of the effect of pH on kinetic parameters of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, in presence and in absence of organic solvents, has shown that a cationic acid group with a pK of 7.4 at 25.5° is implicated in catalysis and that a neutral acid group with a pK of 9.2 at 25.5° is involved in enzyme-substrate binding. From the change in pK with temperature, values of 6,500 and 11,000 cal per mole, respectively, have been calculated for the heats of ionization of these two groups. These data are consistent with the proposal that the imidazolium group of a histidine residue participates in catalysis, and that a water molecule coordinated to the zinc atom functions in enzyme-substrate binding."

https://openalex.org/W2147913816,The injection of epinephrine into the third ventricle of the rat brain causes a biphasic elevation and depression in the integrated multiple-unit electrical activity of the median eminence. Activity in the arcuate nucleus decreases after the injection of the catecholamines. These changes in the integrated multiple-unit electrical activity may be related to the secretion of hormones by the anterior pituitary gland.
