https://openalex.org/W1985893537,"Cells of embryos of the high leukemic mouse strain AKR can be grown in culture as virus-negative cell lines. However, these lines and clonal sublines uniformly have the capacity to initiate synthesis of murine leukemia virus. Exposure of the cells to 5-iododeoxyuridine or 5-bromodeoxyuridine induced synthesis of virus in as high as 0.1 to 0.5 percent of the cells; many of the cells were producing virus as soon as 3 days after initiation of treatment. Induction of virus by these drugs is several orders of magnitude greater than that obtained with any other treatment tested. These studies indicate that the full genome of murine leukemia virus is present in an unexpressed form in all AKR cells and provide a potentially powerful technique for activating leukemia virus genomes in other cell systems."

https://openalex.org/W1608569838,"Abstract The effects of glucagon, epinephrine, and isoproterenol on adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation and glucose mobilization have been studied in isolated rat livers perfused with Krebs bicarbonate buffer containing bovine erythrocytes and serum albumin. Glucagon and epinephrine produced detectable increases in liver cyclic AMP within 30 sec. With glucagon, the level of cyclic AMP rose to a maximum at 3 min and declined slowly over 1 hour. With epinephrine, the cyclic AMP concentration rapidly rose to a peak value at 1 min then declined to a lower level at 5 min and remained constant for the next 30 min. With maximally effective doses of glucagon, the cyclic AMP level was increased 11-fold at 1 min and 60-fold at 5 min. The corresponding values for epinephrine were only 4-fold and 2-fold. The lowest concentration of glucagon producing a significant elevation of cyclic AMP within 4 min was 2 x 10-10 m. A half-maximal cyclic AMP level was observed with about 1 x 10-8 m hormone. The minimally effective concentration of epinephrine for promotion of cyclic AMP accumulation was not clearly defined. A half-maximal response was observed with 1 x 10-7m hormone. By measuring changes in the glucose concentration of the effluent medium from livers from fed rats perfused without recirculation, it was possible to measure amounts of glucagon as low as 5 pmoles. The minimal concentration of glucagon producing significant glucose mobilization in the liver was 2 x 10-10 m while that of epinephrine was 1.4 x 10-8 m. These levels are similar to the minimal concentrations promoting adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate accumulation. Half-maximal glucose mobilization was observed with about 1 x 10-9 m glucagon or 1 x 10-7 m epinephrine. Norepinephrine and isoproterenol increased cyclic AMP accumulation and glucose output in livers perfused without recirculation. They were slightly less potent than epinephrine. Isoproterenol was much less potent than epinephrine or norepinephrine in stimulating glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in livers perfused with recirculating medium. Theophylline potentiated the effects of glucagon and epinephrine on cyclic AMP accumulation and glycogenolysis in the liver, whereas caffeine was ineffective. Serotonin, pancreozymin, and secretin did not affect glucose mobilization in livers from fed rats. Prostaglandin E1 and nicotinic acid did not alter basal or hormone-stimulated glucose production or cyclic AMP accumulation. Livers perfused with fluoride had reduced levels of cyclic AMP. Cessation of glucagon infusion resulted in a rapid fall in cyclic AMP levels, indicating rapid turnover of the nucleotide. When infusions of small amounts of glucagon, epinephrine, or cyclic AMP were stopped, glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis declined at similar rates. The data are discussed in terms of the hypothesis that glucagon and catecholamines act in the liver by increasing the concentration of free, metabolically active cyclic AMP, and that this represents only a small fraction of the total tissue cyclic AMP."

https://openalex.org/W2041117718,The simultaneous assay of the reverse transcriptase and 60S to 70S RNA of oncogenic RNA viruses is described. The virus can be detected at low concentrations in biological fluids containing enzymatically active cell fragments or other contaminants. The fact that two features diagnostic of the oncornaviruses are used in the tests increases the certainty with which a positive outcome can be interpreted.
https://openalex.org/W1481747198,"Abstract The hydrolytic cleavage of Pi from fructose diphosphate by the fructose diphosphatase (FDPase) system of spinach chloroplasts was found to require (a) an alkaline FDPase component insensitive to inhibition by AMP or fructose diphosphate; (b) reduced ferredoxin; (c) a protein factor; and (d) Mg++. Reduced spinach ferredoxin could be replaced by reduced methyl viologen or dithiothreitol but not by reduced bacterial ferredoxin. Activation of the alkaline FDPase component by the nonphysiological substitutes required the protein factor. The alkaline FDPase component in isolated intact chloroplasts was also activated by light. The protein factor component of the FDPase system has been partly purified and found to have a molecular weight of 40,000. The alkaline FDPase component, purified to homogeneity, had a molecular weight of 145,000 and contained 2% carbohydrate. Except for a remarkably high half-cystine content (16% by weight as compared to 2% for mammalian FDPases) which reflects an apparent abundance of cystine, the amino acid composition of the chloroplast alkaline FDPase component resembled that of the mammalian FDPases. In the absence of reduced ferredoxin and protein factor, the chloroplast alkaline FDPase component can be activated by high concentrations of Mg++. Like liver alkaline FDPase, the chloroplast enzyme component is also activated by cystamine or 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenozic acid) (DTNB). Ferredoxin-activated FDPase was inhibited completely by 5 x 10-4 m EDTA but was insensitive to KCN, cuprizone, and diethyldithiocarbamate (all at 1 x 10-3 m). The activity of chloroplast FDPase during photosynthesis appears to be controlled photochemically through reduced ferredoxin. What, if any, physiological role can be ascribed to the activation of the enzyme by high concentrations of Mg++ and disulfide reagents, independently of reduced ferredoxin, is not clear."
https://openalex.org/W1520235667,"Abstract In Klebsiella aerogenes β-galactosidase and histidase are subject to strong catabolite repression by glucose in the presence of a good source of nitrogen. Under conditions of nitrogen limitation, the catabolite repression of histidase is relieved, while β-galactosidase remains strongly repressed. Exogenous adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate relieves the catabolite repression of both histidase and β-galactosidase. A mutant which requires exogenous adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate for the synthesis of many catabolite-sensitive enzymes is able to utilize histidine and synthesize histidase at a rapid rate under conditions of nitrogen limitation in the absence of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. Proline oxidase, like histidase, is subject to catabolite repression and is synthesized rapidly in the presence of glucose when the supply of nitrogen is limited. The adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate requiring mutant is able to utilize proline as a sole nitrogen source in the presence of glucose without exogenous adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. In Salmonella typhimurium, histidase is strongly repressed by glucose, even in nitrogen-starved cells. When histidase genes from S. typhimurium were transferred on an episome to cells of K. aerogenes carrying a deletion of the histidase gene, catabolite repression of histidase was relieved by nitrogen limitation. It is concluded that in K. aerogenes certain catabolitesensitive enzymes which degrade nitrogenous compounds are synthesized rapidly in the presence of glucose if the supply of nitrogen is limited. This rapid synthesis is mediated by a cytoplasmic factor which acts independently of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1606178002,"Abstract An artificial electron donor system—ascorbate and phenazine methosulfate—markedly stimulates β-galactoside transport in isolated membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli ML 308-225. Maximal rates of transport are dependent on the presence of both ascorbate and phenazine methosulfate and also oxygen. Moreover, in the presence of phenazine methosulfate, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide stimulates the initial rate of lactose transport. The effect of ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate is inhibited by removal of oxygen or potassium cyanide, 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, p-chloromercuribenzoate, or sodium amytal. Oxamic acid has no significant effect. Ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate reduces the respiratory chain of the vesicles below the potential level of cytochrome b1, but above approximately 80% of the membrane-bound flavoproteins. In the presence of ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate, membranes prepared from Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas putida, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus megaterium, and Bacillus subtilis catalyze the concentrative uptake of proline; membranes prepared from Staphylococcus aureus catalyze the concentrative uptake of lysine; and membranes prepared from Micrococcus dentrificans catalyze the concentrative uptake of glutamine."

Cells within clumps are commonly electrically coupled and can exchange dyes with a molecular weight of 332 to 500. Gap junctions and intermediate junctions are present, whereas true tight junctions and desmosomes are absent or very rare.

https://openalex.org/W1588148271,"Abstract A hormone antagonist that inhibits the ability of lipolytic hormone to increase adenosine cyclic 3',5'-monophosphate-(cAMP) levels has been found in isolated fat cells from epididymal adipose tissue of rats. Epinephrine, ACTH, or glucagon promoted the formation of this antagonist and its release into the incubation medium. The activity appearing in the medium was dependent on the time of incubation. An increase in the cAMP level in response to the hormone preceded the formation of the hormone antagonist, and the antagonist accumulated during the period when cAMP was decreasing toward the basal level. Both cAMP and dibutyryl-cAMP can mimic the action of hormones to promote the formation of antagonist. The antagonist formed by fat cells incubated with lipolytic hormone prevented the action of a second addition of the hormone, but the sensitivity to hormones could be restored by washing the cells with new medium. The material that accumulated following epinephrine stimulation prevented the action not only of epinephrine but also of ACTH or glucagon. The antagonist was partially purified. Its activity was not mimicked by palmitate (1.0 mm) or oleate (1.5 mm). The inhibitory activity in the incubation medium was equivalent to nanomolar quantities of prostaglandin E1, but the partially purified antagonist, unlike prostaglandin E1, did not elevate cAMP in human platelets or rat spleen slices. The antagonist may be involved in a negative feed back loop-moderating hormone response."
https://openalex.org/W1574814267,"Abstract Transport of a wide variety of amino acids and sugars by membrane vesicles isolated from Escherichia coli ML 308-225 is coupled primarily to d-lactic dehydrogenase. This membrane-bound, flavin-linked primary dehydrogenase is coupled to oxygen via a cytochrome system also present in the vesicle membrane. Spectrophotometric evidence shows that d-lactic dehydrogenase, succinic dehydrogenase, l-lactic dehydrogenase, and NADH dehydrogenase all utilize the same cytochrome system. There is no relationship between rates of oxidation of electron donors by the respiratory chain (succinate g NADH = d-lactate g l-lactate) and the ability of these compounds to stimulate lactose transport (d-lactate >> succinate g l-lactate g NADH). Furthermore, d-lactate in combination with other electron donors is no more effective than d-lactate alone for support of lactose transport. These findings indicate that the site of energy coupling of d-lactic dehydrogenase to active transport lies between the primary dehydrogenase and cytochrome b1. Supportive evidence for this conclusion is obtained from experiments showing that N-ethylmaleimide and p-chloromercuribenzoate inhibit transport and d-lactate-induced respiration. However, these sulfhydryl reagents do not inhibit d-lactic dehydrogenase with dichlorophenolindophenol as an artificial acceptor, nor do they significantly block NADH-induced respiration."
https://openalex.org/W1596494389,"From thermodynamic measurements, it is possible to identify the ligand atoms bound to Fe3+ in nearly rhombic environments. D, the second rank axial coefficient in the spin Hamiltonian, is more than 4 times larger for primarily sulfur-ligated than for primarily oxygen-ligated high spin ferric iron. For the model in this study, rubredoxin, isolated from Pseudomonas oleovorans, containing 1 g atom of Fe3+ per mole of protein was used. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum is that of mononuclear Fe3+ in a nearly completely rhombic environment (E/D = 0.28). The EPR of rubredoxin containing 2 g atoms of Fe3+ per mole of protein is essentially the same; the second atom of Fe3+ enters a magnetically equivalent site. At low temperatures, near 1.4° K, the resonance observed in an X-band spectrometer at geff = 9.4 is that of a ground state transition, while the one observed at higher temperatures at geff = 4.31 is that of an excited state transition. The other resonances to higher (geff = 4.0) and lower (geff = 4.7) field of the geff = 4.31 resonance are also excited state transitions but these arise from the two other principal directions. Fitting the amplitude of any feature of the EPR spectrum taken over the temperature range 1.4 to 40° K to a Boltzmann distribution yields the zero field splitting from which D (1.76 cm-1 in this case) is determined. Similar variable temperature studies performed on ferric pyrrolidone dithiocarbamate, where Fe3+ is completely ligated to sulfur as is rubredoxin, yields a value of 1.68 cm-1 for D."

https://openalex.org/W2077602553,"The particle-bound RNA polymerase activity of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) can be demonstrated in vivo. Linear synthesis of viral RNA persists for 5 to 6 hours at 34 degrees C in infected monolayers of chick embryo cells treated with cycloheximide and actinomycin D to block synthesis of protein and cell-specific RNA. At least 55 percent of the RNA made under these conditions is complementary to virion RNA. RNA synthesis mediated by VSV polymerase activity is inhibited in cells first treated with chick-derived interferon or polyriboinosinate* polyribocytidylate, but not by mouse interferon. The RNA product of VSV polymerase activity is present throughout the cytoplasm, and its synthesis is inhibited by the interferon system, as judged by autoradiographs that show the physical distribution, in cells, of RNA produced by virion polymerase in the absence of translation-a demonstration of the transcription product of the viral genome."
https://openalex.org/W1582729466,"Abstract The mechanism of the insulin-like action of trypsin was studied. When fat cells were exposed to trypsin (1 mg per ml) for 15 sec, glucose metabolism in the cells was stimulated. This stimulation (like that by insulin) was inhibited by phloretin or 3-O-methyl-d-glucose. By the above treatment with trypsin, cellular lipolysis induced by epinephrine was blocked to a large extent, but that induced by caffeine was only partially inhibited. These effects of trypsin on lipolysis were similar to those of insulin at a low concentration (20 to 30 microunits per ml). Trypsin (like insulin) did not inhibit lipolysis induced by N6, O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. When fat cells treated with trypsin were incubated with buffer for a few hours after inactivation of the enzyme, the cells had from the insulin-like effects of the enzyme. The recovery was not significantly inhibited by cycloheximide. The recovered cells were less sensitive to both insulin and trypsin as compared with untreated fat cells. This decrease in sensitivity was partially prevented when a large dose of insulin was added to the incubation medium prior to the trypsin treatment. These data were consistent with an assumption that trypsin (a) interacts initially with the insulin receptor site of fat cells, (b) activates the receptor to produce the metabolic responses characteristic of insulin, and (c) eventually modifies the receptor to render the cells less sensitive than normal to both insulin and trypsin."
https://openalex.org/W1516489392,"Abstract 1. The maximal H+:O ratios of proton transport in highly resolved submitochondrial particles prepared by sonication of bovine heart mitochondria in the presence of ammonia and exposed sequentially to Sephadex and urea (ASU particles) in the presence of oligomycin were found to be 6, 4, and 2 during the oxidation of NADH, succinate, or N-methylphenazonium methosulfate, respectively. A pH dependence for the H+:O ratio was observed with optimal ratios at pH 6.0 to 6.5. 2. Comparison of the effects of an uncoupler (p-trifluoromethoxycarbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone) and of oligo-mycin on proton transport and on respiratory control in ASU particles showed that the effect of these compounds on the respiratory rate could be accounted for by their effect on the proton permeability of the particles. 3. The external and internal buffering powers of ASU particles were calculated from the extent of overshoot of pH change on addition of acid or alkali. 4. Coupling factors of oxidative phosphorylation, F1 and oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein, decreased the proton permeability of ASU particles and allowed proton transport to be observed in the absence of oligomycin."

It is suggested that strontium induces rickets by blocking the biosynthesis of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, the metabolically active form of vitamin D in the intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1492166906,"Abstract Fetal rat calvaria were incubated in Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate medium, containing glucose (2 mg per ml) and bovine serum albumin (1 mg per ml). Incubation in a medium with 0.3 or 0.6 mm dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (DBcAMP) for 15 min caused a 2- to 3-fold increase in the tissue concentration of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (3',5'-AMP). This rise could not be explained by degradation of dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate during the incubation period or the isolation procedure since labeled DBcAMP was not altered in the tissue or medium in incubations carried out for either 15 or 60 min. The intracellular concentration of dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate was 0.12 mm after 15 min of incubation and increased to about 0.26 mm at 2 hours. Dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate was not a substrate for bone cyclic 3',5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase. Bone phosphodiesterase activity was progressively inhibited by increasing concentrations of dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate which was a more potent inhibitor than theophylline. The intracellular dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate concentration in the calvaria appears to be high enough to inhibit intracellular phosphodiesterase activity. When 3',5'-[3H]AMP was added to the media, the radioactivity of the calvaria increased continuously for up to 2 hours. After 15 and 60 min of incubation nearly all of the radioactivity was present in the tissue in the form of [3H]adenosine, suggesting either rapid breakdown of 3',5'-[3H]AMP entering the cell or uptake of [3H]adenosine formed extracellularly by breakdown of 3',5'-[3H]AMP. Adenosine could be detected in the media after 60 min of incubation but not after 15 min. These findings indicate that the biological effects of dibutyryl 3',5'-AMP can be accounted for by an increase in the intracellular concentration of endogenous 3',5'-AMP secondary to inhibition of intracellular phosphodiesterase activity."

https://openalex.org/W1565985255,"Abstract A low molecular weight RNA was isolated from human cells infected with adenovirus 2 and its nucleotide sequence deduced to be pG-G-G-C-A-C-U-C-U-U-C-C-G-U-G-G-U-C-U-G-G-U-G-G-A-U-A-A-A-U-U-C-G-C-A-A-G-G-G-U-A-U-C-A-U-G-G-C-(G-U-G-G-A-C-G-A-C-C)-G-G-G-G-U-U-C-G-A-A-C-C-C-C-G-G-A-U-C-C-G-U-G-A-U-C-C-A-U-G-C-G-G-U-U-A-C-C-G-U-C-C-G-C-C-G-C-C-C-G-U-G-C-G-U-C-G-A-A-C-C-C-A-G-G-U-G-U-G-C-G-A-C-G-U-C-A-G-A-C-A-A-C-G-G-G-G-G-A-G-C-G-C-U-C-C-U-Uoh. To determine this sequence, we analyzed the products of extensive digestion of this RNA with T1 RNase, pancreatic RNase, and spleen acid ribonuclease, the products of extensive T1 RNase digests of partially methylated RNA, the products of pancreatic RNase digestion of RNA modified with a water-soluble carbodiimide, the products of limited digestion of the RNA with T1 RNase, and the oligonucleotides produced by spleen acid nuclease digestion of the limited T1 RNase digestion products."

https://openalex.org/W1612007586,"Abstract Some characteristics of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) interaction with a cyclic AMP-stimulatable protein kinase from bovine skeletal muscle and reactivity of the unbound and complexed cyclic nucleotide with cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase from bovine heart were examined. The velocity of the phosphodiesterase-catalyzed hydrolysis of cyclic AMP was substantially lowered at 0° and 30° with the addition of purified protein kinase to the system. The apparent inhibition of cyclic AMP hydrolysis under these conditions was determined to be due primarily to the nonreactivity with phosphodiesterase of protein-complexed cyclic AMP and not a direct inhibitory effect of the kinase or cyclic AMP-complexed protein. This conclusion derived from the following observations. At 0° where the dissociation of cyclic AMP from the protein complex was undetectable over a 30- to 60-min period by Millipore filtration analysis, the first order rates of 5'-[3H]AMP generation from cyclic [3H]AMP were not appreciably different in the presence or absence of previously formed cyclic AMP complex. The decrement in 5'-[3H]AMP generated by phosphodiesterase at 0° was proportional to the amount of kinase added to the reaction mixture. From a study of the temperature dependence of cyclic AMP dissociation from complex with kinase, it was found that the rate increased with temperature to where a half-time of less than 3 min was achieved at 40°. At 20° where the half-time of cyclic AMP dissociation from complex was approximately 20 min, the production of 5'-[3H]AMP paralleled the rate of cyclic AMP dissociation after the unbound species of cyclic AMP in the system was rapidly degraded by phosphodiesterase. The rate or extent of cyclic [3H]guanosine monophosphate hydrolysis by this preparation of phosphodiesterase which catalyzed the degradation of both cyclic AMP and cyclic guanosine monophosphate was unaffected by addition of the kinase alone or kinase complexed with cyclic AMP. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that phosphodiesterase hydrolyzes only the unbound species of cyclic AMP intracellularly and that the proportion of activated kinase (i.e. catalytic subunit dissociated from the cyclic AMP-bound regulatory subunit) could be adjusted through the enzymic degradation of the unbound species alone because of the rapid equilibrium achievable at higher temperatures between free and protein-complexed cyclic nucleotide. The results also indicate that the absolute amounts of free and complexed cyclic AMP may be estimated in a reaction mixture containing both species by the amount of 5'-nucleotide generated from the unbound cyclic AMP at 0° with phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1565644317,"The phospholipid distribution and the fatty acid composition of the individual phospholipids were determined for the nucleus and the bileaflet nuclear membrane. The phospholipid to protein ratio (milligram per mg) for the nuclear membrane was 0.45 and lipid phosphorus comprised 65% of the total membrane phosphorus. No significant differences were noted in the phospholipid composition of the nucleus and the nuclear membrane. The values for the nuclear membrane were phosphatidyl ethanolamine, 18.3%; phosphatidyl serine plus inositol, 13.8%; phosphatidyl choline, 61.8%; sphingomyelin, 2.5%; lysophosphatidyl choline, 1.4%; cardiolipin plus phosphatidic acid, 1.4%. Differences between the nucleus and the nuclear membrane were detected in the fatty acid composition of the sphingomyelin, lysophosphatidyl choline, and phosphatidyl serine plus inositol fractions. These differences were confined largely to variations in the levels of fatty acids with carbon chain lengths of C20 and above. Phosphatidyl choline and phosphatidyl ethanolamine contained the highest levels of unsaturated fatty acids for both the nucleus (∼53%) and nuclear membrane (∼49%). The lowest degree of unsaturation for the nuclear membrane (23%) was found in sphingomyelin and lysophosphatidyl choline, while the minimum level of unsaturation for the nucleus (24%) was observed in lysophosphatidyl choline. Phosphatidyl serine plus inositol contained the largest amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids for both the nucleus (44%) and the nuclear membrane (33%). A comparison of the fatty acid composition of the nuclear membrane phospholipids to the corresponding literature values for plasma membrane, golgi apparatus, and endoplasmic reticulum revealed major differences."

https://openalex.org/W1608087465,"Abstract Incubation of brown fat cells with a preparation of neuraminidase from Clostridium perfringens at a concentration of 50 µg per ml stimulated basal glucose oxidation and abolished any further response of the cells to insulin and cysteine. High concentrations (125 or 250 µg per ml) of this neuraminidase preparation were toxic to both white and brown fat cells. Preparations of neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae or Lee stain influenza virus did not affect glucose metabolism in either the absence or presence of insulin or cysteine. The effect of the C. perfringens neuraminidase appears to be due to contamination with a potent insulin-like agent. Crude preparations of the enzyme produced an insulin-like effect at a concentration of 0.1 µg per ml. Chemical analysis of the sialic acid content of both brown and white fat cells indicated that most of the sialic acid present in adipose tissue is removed during preparation of the cells by digestion with crude collagenase. A partially purified preparation of C. perfringens phospholipase C stimulated basal glucose metabolism at a concentration of 1 µg per ml in brown fat cells and inhibited the response to insulin and cysteine at a concentration of 5 µg per ml. Insulin-like activity was similarly observed with 10 µg per ml of a purified preparation of clostridial phospholipase C. The ability to stimulate glucose conversion to carbon dioxide by the purified phospholipase C was blocked by 1 mm EDTA or Mg-EDTA while that of the partially purified preparation was enhanced. The addition of egg lipoprotein (10 µl per ml) to the medium, enhanced the insulin-like activity of high concentrations of crude preparations of clostridial phospholipase C and neuraminidase. Treatment of brown fat cells with concentrations of trypsin comparable to those of C. perfringens neuraminidase completely inhibited the stimulation of glucose metabolism by insulin but had little effect on that due to cysteine. Basal glucose oxidation was unaffected by trypsin treatment. White and brown fat cells treated with trypsin did not recover their responsiveness to insulin after four hours of incubation. Our findings indicate that neuraminidase treatment of fat cells does not mimic the action of trypsin and that some commercially available preparations of neuraminidase and phospholipase C from C. perfringens contain insulin-like impurities."
https://openalex.org/W1594991471,"Abstract After NADH addition to Candida utilis submitochondrial particles (SMP) previously incubated with piericidin A, a typical electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum (g⊥ = 1.94, g|| = 2.02) from iron-sulfur protein was obtained at 77° K. Below 30° K, additional EPR signals having peaks at g = 2.09, 2.05, 1.93, 1.89, and 1.86 were detected which are due to at least two species of iron-sulfur proteins. These temperature-sensitive signals were not observed when succinate or glycerol 1-phosphate was added to SMP. Similar signals were also found below 30° K in SMP isolated from bovine heart muscle with small differences in the g values, but they were not detected in SMP from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When the iron concentration of the culture medium for C. utilis cells was lowered, the relative intensity of the EPR signals decreased in parallel. These observations suggest that at least three different species of EPR-detectable iron-sulfur proteins are present in the NADH-dehydrogenase region of the respiratory chain, possibly arising from different parts of the same enzyme molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1592262668,"Abstract Two distinct guanidinocyclitol phosphate phosphatase activities have been detected in extracts of streptomycin-producing strains of Streptomyces and separated on a Sephadex G-200 column. Both enzymatic activities appear following a phase of rapid mycelial growth on complex media, and the enzymes thus are idiophase enzymes. Both enzymes require Mg2+ for activity, and both are inhibited by inorganic phosphate. Guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol phosphate phosphatase catalyzes an essential reaction in the biosynthesis of streptidine (1,3-diguanidino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol), a component of streptomycin. 2-Guanidino-2-deoxy-neo-inositol phosphate and N'-amidinostreptamine phosphate can also serve as substrates. Activity is inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents and stimulated by dithiothreitol. Periodate degradation studies suggest that substrate phosphate is esterified at position 4, para to the guanidino group. Streptomycin-(streptidino)phosphate phosphatase hydrolyzes phosphate esterified with streptidine, either free or combined in streptomycin derivatives, such as dihydrostreptomycin-(streptidino)phosphate and phosphoryldihydrostreptomycin-(streptidino)phosphate. Tris competes effectively with water as an acceptor of phosphate from these compounds; O-phosphoryl-Tris, once formed, is only slowly hydrolyzed. Activity is not inhibited by sulfhydryl reagents. This enzyme also acts to a lesser extent on N-amidinostreptamine phosphate and N'-amidinostreptamine phosphate. Periodate degradation studies on the latter two compounds have suggested that the natural N isomer has its amino group para to the phosphate, whereas the unnatural N' isomer has its guanidino group para to the phosphate. A current concept of the pathway of streptidine biosynthesis is presented."

A molecular weight of approximately 62,000 was obtained for each of the nonidentical subunits, anthranilate synthetase Component I and PR transferase (anthranilate synthetase Component II) by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The two types of subunits were separated by disc gel electrophoresis in 8 m urea. Anthranilate synthetase-PR transferase contained approximately equal amounts of each subunit. Two high affinity tryptophan-binding sites which exhibited positive cooperativity were detected. Binding of tryptophan to these sites was antagonized by both chorismate and Mg2+. Two chorismate-binding sites were detected which had a dissociation constant equal to the Km value for chorismate in the anthranilate synthetase reaction. Binding of chorismate was strongly antagonized by tryptophan. These properties establish that binding of chorismate and tryptophan was to anthranilate synthetase Component I of the aggregate. It is proposed that end product inhibition of anthranilate synthetase activity by tryptophan is due to antagonism of chorismate binding. The results of binding studies and of subunit separation indicate that anthranilate synthetase-PR transferase is composed of two polypeptide chains each of anthranilate synthetase Components I and II."
https://openalex.org/W1540857759,"Abstract Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra of Cu(II) and Co(II) derivatives of human, monkey, and bovine carbonic anhydrases and their anion complexes are reported. The ESR signals of most of the Cu(II) derivatives indicate a coordination geometry with axial symmetry. Copper carbonic anhydrase complexes appear to have one coordination site filled by a monodentate ligand from solution. This ligand causes increasing electron delocalization from the copper ion in the order CH3COO- l OCN- l ethoxzolamide l HCO3- l azosulfamide l H2O l N3- l SH- l CN- as indicated by decreasing values of g||. The presence of highly resolved nitrogen superhyperfine structure in the spectra of the cyanide complexes of Cu(II) human carbonic anhydrases B and C identifies at least 2 equivalent nitrogen atoms as ligands to the metal ion. Carboxymethylation of the human B enzyme modifies the coordination site, but appears to leave the metal ligands unchanged. A new 2:1 cyanide complex of Co(II) carbonic anhydrase is described with an intense ESR signal typical of low spin Co(II) in an axially symmetrical environment. This is in contrast to the broad, weak absorption of the cobalt enzyme and its 1:1 anion complexes which we have examined and which appear to be high spin Co(II). While the ESR spectra of the Cu(II) and Co(II) carbonic anhydrase complexes which show intense signals are best explained by a square planar or five-coordinate square pyramidal geometry, the geometry of these inactive derivatives probably deviates from that of the catalytically active complex. These studies suggest that there is some flexibility of the ligands at the active site and that certain metal ions or anions may force deviation from the active highly distorted four-coordinate geometry."

https://openalex.org/W1525357320,"Abstract The interaction of paramagnetic Mn(II) with free radical covalently bound to the essential sulfhydryl group at the active site of creatine kinase from rabbit muscle has been investigated in the presence of ADP or ATP. The magnetic interaction is manifested by a decrease in the amplitude of the EPR spectrum of the spin label. By titration of this effect with MnADP and MnATP, respectively, the dissociation constants for the ternary enzyme-metal-nucleotide complexes were found to be unchanged from values previously determined for the unmodified enzyme: 0.064 ± 0.004 mm for MnADP and 0.13 ± 0.05 mm for MnATP. The amplitude of the EPR spectrum of the spin-labeled enzyme was suppressed to 6% and 19% of its initial value in the MnADP and MnATP complex, respectively. The enhancement of the proton relaxation rate of water due to the manganese in the ternary enzyme-manganese-nucleotide complexes were found to be 13 ± 2 for the ADP complex and 11 ± 2 for the ATP complexes, 38% and 15%, respectively, lower than the values for the complexes with unmodified enzyme. The distance between the Mn(II) and the nitroxide spin on the enzyme determined by the dipolar interaction between the two paramagnetic species could be estimated from the residual amplitudes of the EPR spectra and the correlation times (electron spin relaxation time of Mn(II) obtained from the enhancement of the proton relaxation rates. The distances were estimated to be 7.5 ± 1.5 A for the ADP complex and 11.5 ± 0.6 A for the ATP complex."
https://openalex.org/W1492963724,"The data presented suggest that GTP, but neither ATP nor ITP, is a substrate for the biosynthesis of the pyrrole ring of the pyrrolopyrimidine nucleoside antibiotics. GTP-8-formylhydrolase from Streptomyces rimosus has been purified 240-fold; the enzyme is not constitutive and chloramphenicol markedly inhibits the biosynthesis of the pyrrolopyrimidine nucleoside antibiotic, sangivamycin, when added to cells in the late log phase of growth. As sangivamycin production increases, the specific activity of GTP-8-formylhydrolase also increases. A streptomyces that produces the nucleoside antibiotic, showdomycin, does not have this enzyme. This enzyme catalyzes the release of carbon 8 of the imidazole ring of GTP as formic acid. The molecular weight is about 500,000. DEAE chromatography splits the enzyme into two active proteins when precipitated with ammonium sulfate and dialyzed against buffer without EDTA. The purified enzyme requires EDTA for full activity; oxygen, p-chloromercuribenzoate, and showdomycin are inhibitory; cysteine reverses this inhibition. These properties of the enzyme along with the in vivo studies and the correlation of enzyme activity in the streptomyces-producing pyrrolopyrimidine nucleoside antibiotics supply information that the ring-opened GTP is the branch point compound for the biosynthesis of folic acid, riboflavin, xanthopterin, toxoflavin, 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole, and the pyrrolopyrimidine nucleoside antibiotics."

https://openalex.org/W1601362494,"Abstract A potent protein kinase present in the acellular slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of casein by ATP has been found to be inhibited by cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP). The rate of the kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of casein was completely inhibitable at a concentration of cAMP above 1 x 10-9 m. A cAMP-activated protein kinase, which is readily separable from the cAMP-inhibitable enzyme, is also present in this organism. The discovery of both of these enzymes in the same organism suggests a more complicated regulatory role for cAMP, via its effects on protein kinases, than previously proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1546872764,"Abstract Deuterated water (2H2O) was found to inhibit the Mg2+-dependent Na+ + K+-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase of rat brain microsomal membrane preparations. At a concentration of 95% 2H2O, the inhibition observed varied between 30 and 52%; no inhibition of the basic Mg2+-stimulated component in the ATPase was observed. The inhibition of the Na+ + K+-stimulated ATPase was not time dependent and was completely reversed on washing the enzyme free of 2H2O. Kinetic analysis of the effects of 2H2O on the various parameters which influence the activity of the Na+ + K+-stimulated ATPase revealed that the inhibition was apparently noncompetitive with respect to ATP, competitive with respect to Na+, and uncompetitive with respect to K+. The K+-stimulated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity associated with the ATPase was stimulated by 2H2O in a competitive manner with respect to K+. Based on these data it is suggested that Na+ activates the Na+ + K+-stimulated ATPase prior to its phosphorylation by ATP and that the presence of H2O at the Na+ site has an important functional role for the activation of the enzyme by Na+. A second locus of action of 2H2O is suggested to be on E2-P (the presumed conformation of the phosphorylated enzyme which is hydrolyzed in the presence of K+) prior to the action of K+ on it. Possibly this results in a change in this phosphorylated form so that its affinity for K+ is increased."
https://openalex.org/W1990311971,"THE recent finding by Cherkin and Meinecke1 that aggressive behaviour in previously isolated male rabbits could be suppressed for some weeks by allowing them to recover in pairs from barbiturate anaesthesia, raises an interesting question concerning the action of components of the pituitary/adreno-cortical axis on behavioural responses. It is well established that most forms of anaesthesia are “stressful” in that they result in activation of the adrenal cortex, and the possibility thus exists that findings such as those by Gherkin and Meinecke are a consequence of changes in ACTH."

NZB and (NZB x NZW)F(1) mice, which normally carry large amounts of Gross virus, and C57BL/6 and NZW mice, which normally carry little virus, were infected with LCM virus. All had Gross soluble antigen in their plasmas at 3 months of age, while noninfected matched controls of all strains did not. This effect was seen after infection with LCM virus that was tissue passed or plaque purified. Similarly, cultures of mouse-embryo fibroblasts produced Gross soluble antigen when infected with LCM virus, but noninfected cultures failed to do so."
https://openalex.org/W1489490162,"Abstract A spin-labeled derivative of rabbit muscle creatine kinase has been prepared by reaction of the essential sulfhydryl group at the active sites with a stoichiometric amount of the nitroxide radical N-(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrrolidinyl) iodoacetamide. The spin-labeled enzyme retains the ability to bind nucleotide substrates although it lacks the phosphotransferase and ATPase activities of the native enzyme. Two magnetic resonance properties of the specifically spin-labeled enzyme and its substrate complexes were used to probe the local environment of the covalently bound radical: (a) the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum and (b) the enhancement of the proton relaxation rate of water protons. The protein-bound radical shows a broad, asymmetric EPR spectrum resembling a solid state powder spectrum; the outer peaks are separated by 62 gauss compared with 31 gauss for the free radical and the amplitude of the central peak is 14 times greater in the unbound than the bound spin label. In addition, the spin-labeled protein enhances the water proton relaxation rate by approximately 1 order of magnitude. Both phenomena indicate a high degree of immobilization of the bound spin label. Metal nucleotide binding increases immobilization of the spin label as evidenced by the EPR spectrum. The spectral changes represent the first direct evidence for a proposed conformational change in the region of the active site on addition of divalent ions to the enzyme-nucleotide binary complex. The proton relaxation rate of water is even more sensitive to local structural changes and reveals differences between the enzyme and its binary nucleotide complexes as well as between binary and ternary enzyme-metal nucleotide complexes. Creatine alone or in combination with metal nucleotides fails to affect either the EPR spectrum or the water proton relaxation rate of the spin-labeled enzyme. The nucleotide complexes of the alkali earth cations, Mg(II), Ca(II), Sr(II), and Ba(II), produce approximately the same changes in the EPR of the spin-labeled enzyme, amounting to a diminution of 20% in central peak amplitude upon addition of metal-ADP and a somewhat smaller effect with the ATP complexes. Quantitative differences in the properties of the different metal complexes are most easily observed by measurement of the proton relaxation rate of water under optimal temperature and frequency conditions. The ternary complexes of the irreversibly inhibitory Zn(II) nucleotides with spin-labeled enzyme have qualitatively different EPR spectra than do the corresponding complexes of alkali earth ions. Apparent dissociation constants have been calculated from both EPR and proton relaxation rate titrations for the dissociation of the alkali earth nucleotides from the ternary complexes. All are of the same order of magnitude as for the native enzyme, about 0.1 mm for ADP ternary complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1513255038,"Abstract To compare the distributions and structures of complete pancreatic RNase digestion products of highly labeled 45 S, 35 S, and 28 S nucleolar RNA and 18 S ribosomal RNA of the Novikoff hepatoma, digests were chromatographed on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 columns at pH 7.6 and 3.3. Each purified oligonucleotide peak was completely digested with T1 RNase. In addition, the frequencies of the mono- and dinucleotides were determined by electrophoresis at pH 3.5. The distributions of the oligonucleotides were very similar for 45 S, 35 S, and 28 S nucleolar RNA and differed markedly from those found for 18 S ribosomal RNA. All the nona- and decanucleotides isolated thus far from nucleolar 45 S RNA were also found in nucleolar 35 S and 28 S RNA when analyzed by chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 columns at pH 3.3 and complete digestion with T1 RNase. Rechromatography of the nonanucleotides of 18 S ribosomal RNA produced only three well defined peaks compared to six for nucleolar 28 S RNA. The decanucleotides identified in 45 S, 35 S, and 28 S nucleolar RNA were absent in 18 S ribosomal RNA. The mono- and dinucleotide frequencies of 18 S ribosomal RNA differed significantly from those determined for 45 S, 35 S, and 28 S RNA. In a comparison of the longest oligonucleotide sequences present in complete pancreatic RNase digests of nucleolar 45 S and 28 S RNA and 18 S ribosomal RNA, a tridecanucleotide with the partial sequence (C3UGp)(A-Gp)(C-Gp)(Gp)(Gp)(Gp)Cp was found to be present in ribosomal 18 S RNA and nucleolar 45 S RNA but absent from nucleolar 28 S RNA. This result provides a chemical evidence for the presence of 18 S ribosomal RNA in 45 S nucleolar RNA."

The synthesis of a glycolipid present in the lower phase of the chloroform-methanol extract of salivary glands increases as early as 1 hour after stimulation with isoproterenol, reaching a peak at 2 hours and returning to control levels by 24 hours. The increased synthesis of this glycolipid, which shows characteristics suggesting that it may be a glycerol glycolipid, is related to the synthesis of DNA that occurs 20 hours later. No quantitative changes were found in the rate of synthesis of glycoproteins or phospholipids after isoproterenol stimulation that could be related to the subsequent DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2020883043,"In 5 patients and 16 dogs the mean concentration of angiotensin I, but not II, was higher in the plasma of the renal vein than in the plasma of the renal artery. The fact that I was higher in the vein than in the artery supports the concept that I is formed in the renal vasculature. In the vein the mean concentration of I was 45 times higher than that of II. The probable formation of angiotensin I within the kidney and its high concentration in the renal vein suggest that if the renin angiotensin system plays a role in the regulation of intrarenal blood flow, then angiotensin I may be the major effector hormone in this process."
