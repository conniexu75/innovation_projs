https://openalex.org/W3013660197,"Minimal phenotyping refers to the reliance on the use of a small number of self-reported items for disease case identification, increasingly used in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we report differences in genetic architecture between depression defined by minimal phenotyping and strictly defined major depressive disorder (MDD): the former has a lower genotype-derived heritability that cannot be explained by inclusion of milder cases and a higher proportion of the genome contributing to this shared genetic liability with other conditions than for strictly defined MDD. GWAS based on minimal phenotyping definitions preferentially identifies loci that are not specific to MDD, and, although it generates highly predictive polygenic risk scores, the predictive power can be explained entirely by large sample sizes rather than by specificity for MDD. Our results show that reliance on results from minimal phenotyping may bias views of the genetic architecture of MDD and impede the ability to identify pathways specific to MDD."
https://openalex.org/W3013822923,"Sodium taste regulates salt intake. The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is the Na+ sensor in taste cells mediating attraction to sodium salts. However, cells and intracellular signaling underlying sodium taste in taste buds remain long-standing enigmas. Here, we show that a subset of taste cells with ENaC activity fire action potentials in response to ENaC-mediated Na+ influx without changing the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and form a channel synapse with afferent neurons involving the voltage-gated neurotransmitter-release channel composed of calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1) and CALHM3 (CALHM1/3). Genetic elimination of ENaC in CALHM1-expressing cells as well as global CALHM3 deletion abolished amiloride-sensitive neural responses and attenuated behavioral attraction to NaCl. Together, sodium taste is mediated by cells expressing ENaC and CALHM1/3, where oral Na+ entry elicits suprathreshold depolarization for action potentials driving voltage-dependent neurotransmission via the channel synapse. Thus, all steps in sodium taste signaling are voltage driven and independent of Ca2+ signals. This work also reveals ENaC-independent salt attraction."

Recent reports indicate that, in the presence of crowding agents, tau can undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), forming highly dynamic liquid droplets. Here, using recombinantly expressed proteins, turbidimetry, fluorescence microscopy imaging, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays, we show that the divalent transition metal zinc strongly promotes this process, shifting the equilibrium phase boundary to lower protein or crowding agent concentrations. We observed no tau LLPS-promoting effect for any other divalent transition metal ions tested, including Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+. We also demonstrate that multiple zinc-binding sites on tau are involved in the LLPS-promoting effect and provide insights into the mechanism of this process. Zinc concentration is highly elevated in AD brains, and this metal ion is believed to be an important player in the pathogenesis of this disease. Thus, the present findings bring a new dimension to understanding the relationship between zinc homeostasis and the pathogenic process in AD and related neurodegenerative disorders.

Because the environment inside phase-separated droplets is distinct from that of the surrounding aqueous phase, LLPS may have a major effect on the formation of pathological protein aggregates in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders (17Nedelsky N.B.

Here, we demonstrate that zinc ions can strongly promote LLPS of tau and provide insight into the mechanism of this process. These findings are of potential importance for understanding the pathogenic process in AD. Consistent with previously published data (15Boyko S. Qi X. Chen T.-H. Surewicz K. Surewicz W.K. Liquid-liquid phase separation of tau protein: the crucial role of electrostatic interactions.J. Biol.

Congdon E.E. Yin H. Kuret J. Triggers of full-length tau aggregation: a role for partially folded intermediates.Biochemistry. 2005; 44 (15823045): 5862-587210.1021/bi0500123Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, upon the addition of Zn2+ (40 μm) to the protein solution at low ionic strength (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), a large increase in turbidity was observed (Fig. 1A), suggesting LLPS. To verify that this effect was indeed due to LLPS (and not protein aggregation), formation of spherical droplets expected for LLPS was directly confirmed by fluorescence microscopy using a mixture of unlabeled tau441 and tau441 labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (10:1 molar ratio) (Fig. 1B). It should be noted that an increase in turbidity of tau solution (in 50 mm Tris buffer) upon zinc addition was also observed in a recent study by Roman et al. (22Roman A.Y. Devred F. Byrne D. La Rocca R. Ninkina N.N. Peyrot V. Tsvetkov P.O. Zinc induces temperature-dependent reversible self-assembly of tau.J. Mol. Biol. 2019; 431 (30580037): 687-69510.1016/j.jmb.2018.12.008Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, this effect was attributed to oligomerization of the protein, not to LLPS. Thus, to further explore the nature of spherical droplets observed in our study, we used time-lapse microscopy to demonstrate that these droplets undergo fusion (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments revealed rapid recovery of the fluorescence signal, indicating fast protein diffusion that was maintained for at least 2 h after droplet formation (Fig. 2B). Altogether, these experiments clearly demonstrate that tau441 in the presence of zinc ions undergoes LLPS, forming highly dynamic liquid droplets that retain their liquid-like character for several hours after induction.Figure 2Zinc-induced tau441 droplets are liquid-like. A, representative fusion events between tau441 (10 μm) droplets induced by 40 μm zinc (Zn2+/tau441 molar ratio of 4:1) in low-ionic strength buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) without any crowding agent.

(n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The capacity of Zn2+ to induce LLPS of tau441 diminished with increasing ionic strength of the buffer (Fig. S1, A and B). However, this capacity could be restored in the presence of crowding agents such as PEG. For example, in the presence of 10% 3-kDa PEG (PEG 3), droplet formation in a Zn2+-containing buffer could be observed at NaCl concentrations at least up to 150 mm (i.e. under the conditions where no LLPS was detectable in the absence of zinc ions) (Fig. 1 (A and B) and Fig. S1 (C and D)). Again, these droplets were highly dynamic, as indicated by FRAP experiments (Fig. 2D) and the ability to undergo fusion (Fig. 2C). Both at low ionic strength (in the absence of any crowding agents) and at higher ionic strength (in the presence of PEG 3), significant LLPS was observed only above the threshold Zn2+ to tau441 molar ratio of ∼2:1, and the extent of LLPS was gradually increasing with increasing concentration of zinc ions (Fig. 1, C and D). Data obtained in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl at various protein and PEG 3 concentrations in the absence and presence of zinc (Zn2+/tau441 molar ratio of 4:1) are summarized in the form of phase diagrams shown in Fig. 1E. These phase diagrams clearly demonstrate that zinc ions strongly enhance the propensity for tau to form a two-phase system, shifting the equilibrium phase boundary to lower protein or crowding agent concentrations. For example, in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 12% PEG 3 (i.e. within the range of PEG concentrations typically used to mimic intracellular molecular crowding (23Fulton A.B. How crowded is the cytoplasm?.Cell. 1982; 30 (6754085): 345-34710.1016/0092-8674(82)90231-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar)), significant LLPS in the presence of zinc was observed at tau441 concentration as low as 2 μm. In contrast, LLPS in the absence of zinc could be detected only at tau441 concentrations above ∼5 μm (Fig. 1E). To put this in a physiological context, intracellular tau concentrations are estimated to be between ∼2 and 7 μm (14Wegmann S. Eftekharzadeh B. Tepper K. Zoltowska K.M. Bennett R.E. Dujardin S. Laskowski P.R. MacKenzie D. Kamath T. Commins C. Vanderburg C. Roe A.D. Fan Z. Molliex A.M. Hernandez-Vega A. Muller D. et al.Tau protein liquid–liquid phase separation can initiate tau aggregation.EMBO J. 2018; 37 (29472250): e9804910.15252/embj.201798049Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). A similar LLPS-promoting effect of Zn2+ was observed when higher-molecular weight PEG 10, a more potent crowding agent employed in previous studies on tau LLPS (15Boyko S. Qi X. Chen T.-H. Surewicz K. Surewicz W.K. Liquid-liquid phase separation of tau protein: the crucial role of electrostatic interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 (31097543): 11054-1105910.1074/jbc.AC119.009198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was used (Fig. S2). Next, we asked the question of whether the LLPS-promoting effect of Zn2+ described above is representative of all divalent transition metal ions or if it is rather zinc-specific. Surprisingly, none of other divalent transition metal ions tested (Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Cu2+) was found to facilitate phase separation of tau441 in high or low ionic strength buffer, at least at zinc concentration up to 40 μm (Fig. 3 (A and B) and Fig. S3). This indicates that these other transition metal ions have much lower (if any) capacity to promote tau LLPS. Furthermore, the effect of Zn2+ appears to be independent of the zinc salt's component anion, as ZnSO4 and ZnCl2 have an essentially identical capacity to facilitate LLPS of tau441 (Fig. 3, A and B). We also verified that, as expected, the addition of a metal-chelating agent, EDTA, completely abrogated Zn2+-induced LLPS of the protein (Fig. 3, C and D). Tau441 consists of the negatively charged N-terminal region (that contains two inserts, N1 and N2), a proline-rich region, and four pseudo-repeats flanked by the C-terminal residues (Fig. 4A). Both the proline-rich region and the pseudo-repeats are highly enriched in positively charged residues, whereas the most C-terminal part has an overall negative charge. The four pseudo-repeats are known to be essential for microtubule binding as well as pathological aggregation of tau (1Wang Y. Mandelkow E. Tau in physiology and pathology.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17 (26631930): 5-2110.1038/nrg.2015.11Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 2Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry and cell biology of tau protein in neurofibrillary degeneration.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2012; 2 (22762014): a00624710.1101/cshperspect.a006247Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To determine the role of individual tau441 regions in Zn2+-induced LLPS, we employed a number of deletion/substitution variants and fragments of tau441 (Fig. 4A). First, we focused on the pseudo-repeat region (4R), finding that the deletion of this entire domain was sufficient to completely abrogate the ability of zinc to facilitate LLPS, as indicated both by turbidity data (Fig. 4B) and fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4C). Given that Cys residues present in the pseudo-repeat region (Cys-291 in R2 and Cys-322 in R3) were previously reported to be important for zinc binding to tau (24Mo Z.-Y. Zhu Y.-Z. Zhu H.-L. Fan J.-B. Chen J. Liang Y. Low micromolar zinc accelerates the fibrillization of human tau via bridging of Cys-291 and Cys-322.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284 (19826005): 34648-3465710.1074/jbc.M109.058883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), next we tested the role of these residues in LLPS. Replacement of either Cys-291 or Cys-322 alone with Ser partially diminished the ability for Zn2+ to induce LLPS (although droplets were still visualized by microscopy, a lower turbidity as compared with WT full-length protein was observed). However, substitution of both of these cysteines completely abrogated the ability of zinc ions to induce droplet formation (Fig. 4). Despite the critical role of Cys residues within the pseudo-repeat region in Zn2+-induced LLPS of full-length tau, neither the isolated pseudo-repeat segment (K18 fragment) nor the longer fragment containing both the pseudo-repeat region and C-terminal residues (Δ1–243tau) was able to undergo LLPS in the presence of zinc ions under the experimental conditions used in the present study. This indicates that additional tau regions are important for this process. To further explore this issue, we performed experiments with the N-terminally truncated variant tauΔ1–117 (in which the entire negatively charged segment has been deleted), finding that Zn2+ ions were no longer able to facilitate LLPS of this protein (Fig. 4). Finally, the deletion of only part of the negatively charged region (Δ2N variant in which residues 45–103 are missing) resulted in a partial abrogation of Zn2+-induced LLPS, as indicated by smaller turbidity increase as compared with that observed for full-length tau441 (Fig. 4). The previous study (15Boyko S. Qi X. Chen T.-H. Surewicz K. Surewicz W.K. Liquid-liquid phase separation of tau protein: the crucial role of electrostatic interactions.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 (31097543): 11054-1105910.1074/jbc.AC119.009198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (performed using similar experimental conditions but a more potent crowding agent, PEG 10) revealed that, in the absence of zinc, the N-terminally truncated tau441 variants Δ1–243 and Δ1–117 as well as the K18 fragment lost the ability to undergo LLPS, whereas the propensity of the Δ2N and Δ4R variants for LLPS was diminished (but not completely abrogated), as indicated by the requirement for higher concentrations of the crowding agent compared with that for tau441. This, together with data shown herein in Fig. 4B, suggests that zinc can promote LLPS only for those tau variants that have an intrinsic propensity to undergo phase separation even in the absence of the metal ion. To further probe this issue and conclusively establish the role of Cys residues in the LLPS-promoting effect of zinc, we performed additional experiments in the presence of 12% PEG 3 (i.e. under conditions that lead to partial LLPS of the full-length protein and some of its variants in the absence of zinc). As shown in Fig. S4, also under these conditions, zinc partially retained the ability to further promote LLPS of the Δ2N and single-Cys variants, but completely lost the ability to facilitate LLPS of the Δ4R and C291S/C322S variants. Thus, the presence of at least one Cys residue is crucial for this effect. This is in line with the finding that substitution of individual Cys residues in a tau fragment encompassing residues 244–372 only modestly decreases the affinity for Zn2+, whereas substitution of both of them totally abrogates this binding (24Mo Z.-Y. Zhu Y.-Z. Zhu H.-L. Fan J.-B. Chen J. Liang Y. Low micromolar zinc accelerates the fibrillization of human tau via bridging of Cys-291 and Cys-322.J. Biol.

Altogether, the present data clearly demonstrate that zinc strongly promotes LLPS of full-length tau and identify specific structural elements within the protein that are important for this effect. The finding that Cys residues are essential for Zn2+-induced LLPS is consistent with previous isothermal titration calorimetry studies that identified a single high-affinity binding site (with reported Kd between 0.5 and 4 μm) in which zinc is coordinated by two Cys and two His residues (His-330 and His-362) within the R2-R3 tau region (22Roman A.Y.

However, this high-affinity binding appears to be insufficient to promote LLPS, as zinc-induced droplet formation was observed only at Zn2+/tau441 molar ratios above 2:1. This conundrum may be explained by the most recent finding that, in addition to the high binding site, tau contains three low-affinity zinc-binding sites, with an average Kd around 20 μm (22Roman A.Y. Devred F. Byrne D. La Rocca R. Ninkina N.N. Peyrot V. Tsvetkov P.O. Zinc induces temperature-dependent reversible self-assembly of tau.J. Mol.

These low-affinity binding sites appear to be also essential for zinc's ability to promote LLPS of tau. Even though the nature of the latter binding sites is at present unknown, they likely involve His residues outside the pseudo-repeat region as well as Asp and Glu residues (25Fichou Y. Al-Hilaly Y.K.

The finding that the extent of tau LLPS gradually increases at zinc concentrations corresponding to Zn2+/tau molar ratios above 4:1 (Fig. 1D) suggests that at least some of the low-affinity binding sites become populated only at zinc concentration higher than expected for the reported average Kd value of ∼20 μm (22Roman A.Y.

Even though the LLPS-promoting effect of zinc is critically dependent on the presence of at least one Cys residue within the pseudo-repeat region, the latter region alone appears to be insufficient to support this effect, as the K18 fragment was not able to undergo LLPS, even at high zinc concentrations. It should be noted that droplet formation by K18 (in the absence of zinc) was previously reported (28Ambadipudi S. Biernat J. Riedel D. Mandelkow E. Zweckstetter M.

Here we show that mice bearing human ALS-associated TBK1 missense loss-of-function mutations, or mice in which the Tbk1 gene is selectively deleted in motor neurons, do not display a neurodegenerative disease phenotype. However, loss of TBK1 function in motor neurons of the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS impairs autophagy, increases SOD1 aggregation, and accelerates early disease onset without affecting lifespan. By contrast, point mutations that decrease TBK1 kinase activity in all cells also accelerate disease onset but extend the lifespan of SOD1 mice. This difference correlates with the failure to activate high levels of expression of interferon-inducible genes in glia. We conclude that loss of TBK1 kinase activity impacts ALS disease progression through distinct pathways in different spinal cord cell types and further implicate the importance of glia in neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3013790276,"During human evolution, the knee adapted to the biomechanical demands of bipedalism by altering chondrocyte developmental programs. This adaptive process was likely not without deleterious consequences to health. Today, osteoarthritis occurs in 250 million people, with risk variants enriched in non-coding sequences near chondrocyte genes, loci that likely became optimized during knee evolution. We explore this relationship by epigenetically profiling joint chondrocytes, revealing ancient selection and recent constraint and drift on knee regulatory elements, which also overlap osteoarthritis variants that contribute to disease heritability by tending to modify constrained functional sequence. We propose a model whereby genetic violations to regulatory constraint, tolerated during knee development, lead to adult pathology. In support, we discover a causal enhancer variant (rs6060369) present in billions of people at a risk locus (GDF5-UQCC1), showing how it impacts mouse knee-shape and osteoarthritis. Overall, our methods link an evolutionarily novel aspect of human anatomy to its pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2943384502,"Adipocyte progenitors (APs) express platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), PDGFRα and PDGFRβ. Elevated PDGFRα signaling inhibits adipogenesis and promotes fibrosis; however, the function of PDGFRs in APs remains unclear. We combined lineage tracing and functional analyses in a sequential dual-recombinase approach that creates mosaic Pdgfr mutant cells by Cre/lox recombination with a linked Flp/frt reporter to track individual cell fates. Using mosaic lineage labeling, we show that adipocytes are derived from the Pdgfra lineage during postnatal growth and adulthood. In contrast, adipocytes are only derived from the mosaic Pdgfrb lineage during postnatal growth. Functionally, postnatal mosaic deletion of PDGFRα enhances adipogenesis and adult deletion enhances β3-adrenergic-receptor-induced beige adipocyte formation. Mosaic deletion of PDGFRβ also enhances white, brown, and beige adipogenesis. These data show that both PDGFRs are cell-autonomous inhibitors of adipocyte differentiation and implicate downregulation of PDGF signaling as a critical event in the transition from AP to adipocyte."

We tested whether inhibition of CCN2 (cellular communication network factor 2, previously known as connective tissue growth factor, CTGF) using a specific antibody (termed FG-3019 or pamrevlumab) reduces established overuse-induced muscle fibrosis in a clinically relevant rodent model of upper extremity overuse injury. Young adult rats performed a high repetition high force (HRHF) reaching and lever-pulling task for 18 weeks, after first being shaped for 6 weeks to learn this operant task. Rats were then euthanized (HRHF-Untreated), or rested and treated for 6 weeks with FG-3019 (HRHF-Rest/FG-3019) or a human IgG as a vehicle control (HRHF-Rest/IgG). HRHF-Untreated and HRHF-Rest/IgG rats had higher muscle levels of several fibrosis-related proteins (TGFβ1, CCN2, collagen types I and III, and FGF2), and higher muscle numbers of alpha SMA and pERK immunopositive cells, compared to control rats. Each of these fibrogenic changes was restored to control levels by the blocking of CCN2 signaling in HRHF-Rest/FG-3019 rats, as were HRHF task-induced increases in serum CCN2 and pro-collagen I intact N-terminal protein. Levels of cleaved CCN3, an antifibrotic protein, were lowered in HRHF-Untreated and HRHF-Rest/IgG rats, compared to control rats, yet elevated back to control levels in HRHF-Rest/FG-3019 rats. Significant grip strength declines observed in HRHF-Untreated and HRHF-Rest/IgG rats, were restored to control levels in HRHF-Rest/FG-3019 rats. These results are highly encouraging for use of FG-3019 for therapeutic treatment of persistent skeletal muscle fibrosis, such as those induced with chronic overuse."

The relevance of APA in stem cell hierarchies remains elusive. Here, we first demonstrate the requirement of the APA regulator Pabpn1 for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function. We then determine the genome-wide APA landscape (APAome) of HSCs and progenitors by performing low-input 3' sequencing paired with bioinformatic pipelines. This reveals transcriptome-wide dynamic APA patterns and an overall shortening of 3'-UTRs during differentiation and upon homeostatic or stress-induced transition from quiescence to proliferation. Specifically, we show that APA regulates activation-induced Glutaminase (Gls) isoform switching by Nudt21. This adaptation of the glutamine metabolism by increasing the GAC:KGA isoform ratio fuels versatile metabolic pathways necessary for HSC self-renewal and proper stress response. Our study establishes APA as a critical regulatory layer orchestrating HSC self-renewal, behavior, and commitment."

We found that MDR is associated with higher UGCG expression and with a complex GSL profile. UGCG inhibition with the ceramide analog d-threo-1-(3,4,-ethylenedioxy)phenyl-2-palmitoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (EtDO-P4) greatly reduced GSL and monosialotetrahexosylganglioside levels, and co-treatment with standard chemotherapeutics sensitized cells to mitochondrial membrane potential loss and apoptosis.

https://openalex.org/W3013943846,"The intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD)-related diseases occur in more than 90% of the population older than 50 years. Owing to the lack of understanding of the cellular mechanisms involved in IVDD formation effective treatment options are still unavailable. Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles that play important roles in the organ development. Intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins are essential for the assembly and bidirectional transport within the cilium. Role of cilia and IFT80 protein in intervertebral disc (IVD) development, maintenance, and degeneration are largely unknown. Using cilia-GFP mice, we found presence of cilia on growth plate (GP), cartilage endplate (EP) annulus fibrosus (AF), and nucleus pulposus (NP) with varying ciliary length. Cilia length in NP and AF during IVDD were significantly decreased. However, cilia numbers increased by 63% in AF during repair. Deletion of IFT80 in type II collagen-positive cells resulted in cilia loss in GP and EP, and disrupted IVD structure with disorganized and decreased GP, EP, and internal AF (IAF), and less compact and markedly decreased gel-like matrix in the NP. Deletion of IFT80 in type I collagen-positive cells led to a disorganized outer AF (OAF) with thinner, loosened, and disconnected fiber alignment. Mechanistic analyses showed that loss of IFT80 caused a significant increase in cell apoptosis in the IVD, and a marked decrease in expression of chondrogenic markers - type II collagen, sox9, aggrecan, and hedgehog (Hh) signaling components, including Gli1 and Patch1 in the IVD of IFT80fl/fl; Col2-creERT mice, and Gli1 and Patch1 expression in the OAF of IFT80fl/fl; Col1-creERT mice. Interestingly, Smoothened agonist-SAG rescued OAF cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation. Our findings demonstrate that ciliary IFT80 is important for the maintenance of IVD cell organization and function through regulating the cell survival and Hh signaling."

Adjusting for age, sex and origin, PLHIV were more likely to be current smokers (adjusted OR:1.53 [95% CI:1.35-1.74]) and dyslipidemic (aOR:1.18; [1.04-1.34]), less likely to be obese (aOR:0.44 [0.38-0.52], with no differences in hypertension, diabetes or high (≥20%) FRS but with greater odds of high (≥5%) SCORE (aOR:1.55 [1.05-2.30]). Further adjustment for educational level, anti-HCV positivity and BMI showed higher prevalence of hypertension in PLHIV.Despite the relative absence of obesity, PLHIV have higher prevalence of traditional CVD risk factors and higher risk of fatal CVD compared to general population. Regular screening and early management of CVD risk factors in PLHIV should be of high priority for CVD prevention."

Here we investigated the functional relevance of a genetic region in 6q22.2 which was identified to be associated with lung cancer risk in our previous GWAS. We performed linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis and bioinformatic prediction to screen functional SNPs linked to a tagSNP in 6q22.2 loci, followed by two case-control studies and a meta-analysis with 4403 cases and 5336 controls to identify if these functional SNPs were associated with lung cancer risk. A novel SNP rs17079281 in the DCBLD1 promoter was identified to be associated with lung cancer risk in Chinese populations. Compared with those with C allele, patients with T allele had lower risk of adenocarcinoma (adjusted OR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.80–0.92), but not squamous cell carcinoma (adjusted OR = 0.99; 95% CI: 0.91–1.10), and patients with the C/T or T/T genotype had lower levels of DCBLD1 expression than those with C/C genotype in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. We performed functional assays to characterize its biological relevance. The results showed that the T allele of rs17079281 had higher binding affinity to transcription factor YY1 than the C allele, which suppressed DCBLD1 expression. DCBLD1 behaved like an oncogene, promoting tumor growth by influencing cell cycle progression. These findings suggest that the functional variant rs17079281C&gt;T decreased lung adenocarcinoma risk by creating an YY1-binding site to suppress DCBLD1 expression, which may serve as a biomarker for assessing lung cancer susceptibility."

Metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder is generally incurable by current chemotherapy and leads to early mortality. Recent studies have identified molecular subtypes of MIBCs with different sensitivities to frontline therapy, suggesting tumor heterogeneity. We have performed multi-omic profiling of the kinome in bladder cancer patients with the goal of identify therapeutic targets. Our analyses revealed amplification, overexpression, and elevated kinase activity of P21 (RAC1) activated kinase 4 (PAK4) in a subset of Bladder cancer (BLCA). Using bladder cancer cells, we confirmed the role of PAK4 in BLCA cell proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, we observed that a PAK4 inhibitor was effective in curtailing growth of BLCA cells. Transcriptomic analyses identified elevated expression of another kinase, protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6), upon treatment with a PAK4 inhibitor and RNA interference of PAK4. Treatment with a combination of kinase inhibitors (vandetanib and dasatinib) showed enhanced sensitivity compared with either drug alone. Thus, PAK4 may be therapeutically actionable for a subset of MIBC patients with amplified and/or overexpressed PAK4 in their tumors. Our results also indicate that combined inhibition of PAK4 and PTK6 may overcome resistance to PAK4. These observations warrant clinical investigations with selected BLCA patients."

This simple modification can dramatically affect the activities and half-lives of glycoproteins, effects that are relevant to understanding the invasiveness of some cancers, development of mAb therapeutics, and the etiology of a congenital glycosylation disorder. The acceptor substrate preferences of FUT8 are well-characterized and provide a framework for understanding N-glycan maturation in the Golgi; however, the structural basis of these substrate preferences and the mechanism through which catalysis is achieved remain unknown. Here we describe several structures of mouse and human FUT8 in the apo state and in complex with GDP, a mimic of the donor substrate, and with a glycopeptide acceptor substrate at 1.80-2.50 A resolution. These structures provide insights into a unique conformational change associated with donor substrate binding, common strategies employed by fucosyltransferases to coordinate GDP, features that define acceptor substrate preferences, and a likely mechanism for enzyme catalysis. Together with molecular dynamics simulations, the structures also revealed how FUT8 dimerization plays an important role in defining the acceptor substrate-binding site.

https://openalex.org/W3012988750,"Background PET-based tumor delineation is an error prone and labor intensive part of image analysis. Especially for patients with advanced disease showing bulky tumor FDG load, segmentations are challenging. Reducing the amount of user-interaction in the segmentation might help to facilitate segmentation tasks especially when labeling bulky and complex tumors. Therefore, this study reports on segmentation workflows/strategies that may reduce the inter-observer variability for large tumors with complex shapes with different levels of user-interaction. Methods Twenty PET images of bulky tumors were delineated independently by six observers using four strategies: (I) manual, (II) interactive threshold-based, (III) interactive threshold-based segmentation with the additional presentation of the PET-gradient image and (IV) the selection of the most reasonable result out of four established semi-automatic segmentation algorithms (Select-the-best approach). The segmentations were compared using Jaccard coefficients (JC) and percentage volume differences. To obtain a reference standard, a majority vote (MV) segmentation was calculated including all segmentations of experienced observers. Performed and MV segmentations were compared regarding positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity (SE), and percentage volume differences. Results The results show that with decreasing user-interaction the inter-observer variability decreases. JC values and percentage volume differences of Select-the-best and a workflow including gradient information were significantly better than the measurements of the other segmentation strategies (p-value<0.01). Interactive threshold-based and manual segmentations also result in significant lower and more variable PPV/SE values when compared with the MV segmentation. Conclusions FDG PET segmentations of bulky tumors using strategies with lower user-interaction showed less inter-observer variability. None of the methods led to good results in all cases, but use of either the gradient or the Select-the-best workflow did outperform the other strategies tested and may be a good candidate for fast and reliable labeling of bulky and heterogeneous tumors."

Building Bridges is a community health worker prevention program designed to increase refugee's cancer screening uptake. The purpose of this cross sectional analysis was to assess differences in uptake of cervical, breast, liver, and colorectal screens across six cultural groups.Data was abstracted in 2018 for this analysis. Participants were categorized into six cultural groups (Myanmar, Central Africa, Bhutan, Somalia, Arabic Speaking Countries, and Other) to assess differences in sociodemographic measures and screening uptake. Uptake proportions were calculated for each cancer type (cervical, breast, liver, and colon) among eligible participants, by gender and cultural group. Differences in uptake across groups were assessed using stratified analysis and logistic regression. Prevalence odds ratios (POR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each group to assess the association between screening completion and cultural group.874 refugees were asked about cancer screening history. The majority of participants were either 'never had been screened' or 'not up-to-date' for every cancer screening. Among age eligible, 82% had no prior pap exam within the past 3 years, 81% had no prior mammogram within the past year, 69% didn't know their Hepatitis B status and 87% never had a colon cancer screening. Overall, higher uptake of all types of cancer screenings was observed in Myanmar and Bhutanese groups, except colon cancer screening which was higher among Central African Region and Arabic Speaking participants.Screening uptake varied by ethnic group and screening type. The program reached an under and never screened population, however, the proportion of refugees who received a cancer screening remained low compared to the US population. Diversity within refugee communities requires adaptation to specific cultural and linguistic needs to include new Americans in cancer elimination efforts."

This paper details the qualitative findings from that assessment. Methods Using the World Health Organization MOV methodology, teams conducted focus group discussions among caregivers and health workers and in-depth interviews of key informants in 10 counties in Kenya. Caregivers of children <24 months of age visiting the selected health facilities on the day of the assessment were requested to participate in focus group discussions. Health workers were purposively sampled to capture a broad range of perspectives. Key informants were selected based on their perceived insight on immunization services at the county, sub-county, or health facility level. Results Six focus group discussions with caregivers, eight focus group discussions with health workers, and 35 in-depth interviews with key informants were completed. In general, caregivers had positive attitudes toward healthcare and vaccination services, but expressed a desire for increased education surrounding vaccination. In order to standardize vaccination checks at all health facility visits, health workers and key informants emphasized the need for additional trainings for all staff members on immunization. Health workers and key informants also highlighted the negative impact of significant understaffing in health facilities, and the persistent challenge of stock-outs of vaccines and vaccination-related supplies. Conclusions Identified factors that could contribute to MOV include a lack of knowledge surrounding vaccination among caregivers and health workers, inadequate number of health workers, and stock-outs of vaccines or vaccination-related materials. In addition, vaccination checks outside of vaccination visits lacked consistency, leading to MOV in non-vaccinating departments. Qualitative assessments could provide a starting point for understanding and developing interventions to address MOV in other countries."

The aim of this study was to identify issues related to gender-based vulnerability in a group of WWUD attended in a harm reduction facility in Madrid, Spain. Material and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during a screening of blood borne infections. We included WWUD (smoked or injected heroin/cocaine) who were actively screened for HIV, HBV and HCV in a harm reduction setting in Madrid (Spain) from January to December 2017. WWUD were interviewed for gender-based abuse or violence using a face-to-face questionnaire by a trained interviewer. Aspects related to their social-epidemiological condition and gender-based vulnerability were collected. Results We included 109 women who were actively using drugs. The median age was 39 (IQR 35–47) years, 84.4% were Spanish born, 22.9% were homeless, 43 (41.7%) had ever used injected drugs, 29 (26.6%) were currently using injected drugs, and 27.1% had mental health disorders. Aspects related to gender-based vulnerability were collected. Among those surveyed, they reported having ever suffered emotional or psychological damage (88%), having experienced at least one incident of serious physical injury by a male partner (71%), and having ever suffered sexual abuse (49%). In addition, 28% had ever exchanged sex for money/drugs. When compared to women that did not use injecting drugs, those who injected drugs had more frequently exchanged sex for money/drugs (55% vs 21%, p = 0.003). Conclusions A high proportion of WWUD suffer psychological or physical violence by partners denoting gender-based vulnerability. Interventions in harm reduction settings with a multidisciplinary and gender-based approach should be implemented."
https://openalex.org/W3013172794,"When herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection is initiated in the ocular, nasal, or oral cavity, sensory neurons within trigeminal ganglia (TG) become infected. Following a burst of viral transcription in TG neurons, lytic cycle viral genes are suppressed and latency is established. The latency-associated transcript (LAT) is the only viral gene abundantly expressed during latency, and LAT expression is important for the latency-reactivation cycle. Reactivation from latency is required for virus transmission and recurrent disease, including encephalitis. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is differentially expressed in TG during the bovine herpesvirus 1 latency-reactivation cycle. Hence, we hypothesized HSV-1 regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and promotes maintenance of latency because this pathway enhances neuronal survival and axonal repair. New studies revealed β-catenin was expressed in significantly more TG neurons during latency compared to TG from uninfected mice or mice latently infected with a LAT-/- mutant virus. When TG explants were incubated with media containing dexamethasone to stimulate reactivation, significantly fewer β-catenin+ TG neurons were detected. Conversely, TG explants from uninfected mice or mice latently infected with a LAT-/- mutant increased the number of β-catenin+ TG neurons in the presence of DEX relative to samples not treated with DEX. Impairing Wnt signaling with small molecule antagonists reduced virus shedding during explant-induced reactivation. These studies suggested β-catenin was differentially expressed during the latency-reactivation cycle, in part due to LAT expression."
https://openalex.org/W3013282742,"In recent years, the reach and influence of far-right ideologies have been extended through online communities with devastating effects in the real world. In this research, we examine how far-right online communities can be empowered by socio-political events that are significant to them. Using over 14 years of data extracted from an Australian national sub-forum of a global online white supremacist community, we investigate whether the group cohesion of the community is affected by local race riots. Our analysis shows that the online community, not only became more cohesive after the riots, but was also reinvigorated by highly active new members who joined during the week of the riots or soon after. These changes were maintained over the longer-term, highlighting pervasive ramifications of the local socio-political context for this white supremacist community. Pre-registered analyses of data extracted from other white supremacist online communities (in South Africa and the United Kingdom) show similar effects on some of the indicators of group cohesion, but of reduced magnitude, and not as enduring as the effects found in the context of the Australian far-right online community."
https://openalex.org/W3013767997,"Chromogranin A (CgA) is a key luminal actor of secretory granule biogenesis at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) level but the molecular mechanisms involved remain obscure. Here, we investigated the possibility that CgA acts synergistically with specific membrane lipids to trigger secretory granule formation. We show that CgA preferentially interacts with the anionic glycerophospholipid phosphatidic acid (PA). In accordance, bioinformatic analysis predicted a PA-binding domain (PABD) in CgA sequence that effectively bound PA (36:1) or PA (40:6) in membrane models. We identified PA (36:1) and PA (40:6) as predominant species in Golgi and granule membranes of secretory cells, and we found that CgA interaction with these PA species promotes artificial membrane deformation and remodeling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that disruption of either CgA PABD or phospholipase D (PLD) activity significantly alters secretory granule formation in secretory cells. Our findings show for the first time the ability of CgA to interact with PLD-generated PA, which allows membrane remodeling and curvature, key processes necessary to initiate secretory granule budding."

Children with perinatal HIV infection (PHIV) have survived through their adolescence and are entering adulthood. We determined the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, abnormal biochemical markers, and characterized body composition parameters in youth living with perinatal HIV infection. This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Research Institute for Health Sciences, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai, Thailand from December 2017 to February 2018. PHIV-youths between 15 <25 years of age who were receiving ART were enrolled. Data collection included ART-related history, blood pressure, and anthropometric measurements. Body composition including android, gynoid fat mass, and total body fat were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Fasting blood was drawn to test for lipid profile, glucose, and high sensitivity c-reactive protein (hsCRP). One hundred and twenty PHIV-youths (48% female) were enrolled. Their mean age and the median duration on ART were 20.3 (SD2.6) and 14.1 (IQR 10.4-14.9) years, respectively; 76 (63%) were on first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors-based regimens. Thirty-three (28%), 74 (62%), and 13 (11%) of PHIV-youths were underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), normal (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), and overweight (BMI ≥ 25.0 kg/m2), respectively. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 10.6% (95%CI 5.0-16.0). Seventy-six of 113 (67.3%) of PHIV-youths had lipid alteration; the most prevalent types being low HDL (46.9%) and increased triglycerides (27.4%). Overall 43 (35.9%) had increased hsCRP (16.7% with immediate and 19.2% with high risk for CVD). Females had significantly higher percentage of android and gynoid fat, but lower Android to gynoid ratio (AGR) compared to males. There were 77%, 31%, and 21% of PHIV-youths in the overweight, normal weight, and underweight group with AGR in tertile 3, respectively. In conclusion, we documented presence of metabolic syndrome in 10.6% of PHIV-youths on ART. Increase AGR representing abdominal obesity was detected even in youths with normal BMI or underweight."

Through in-depth sequence analysis and systematic mutagenesis, we determined the consensus HEPN motif in the Las1 subfamily and uncovered its canonical and specialized elements. Using reconstituted Las1 HEPN-HEPN′ chimeras, we defined the molecular requirements for RNA cleavage. Intriguingly, both copies of the Las1 HEPN motif were important for nuclease function, revealing that both HEPN motifs participate in coordinating the RNA within the Las1 active site.

The HEPN (higher eukaryotes and prokaryotes nucleotide-binding) superfamily is an emerging group of endoribonucleases spanning across all walks of life. The HEPN domain is characterized by a small α-helical domain originally suggested to be important for nucleotide binding (2Grynberg M. Erlandsen H. Godzik A.

Subsequent bioinformatic analysis transformed the field through the widespread identification of HEPN-containing proteins and the classification of a catalytic subset that encode for a short, but defined, RφXXXH (where φ is often N, D, or H, and X is any amino acid that can vary from three to five residues) endoribonuclease motif (3Anantharaman V.

The expanding list of HEPN nucleases highlights their profound role in numerous biological processes, most notably host-defense and stress response pathways.

To gain a better understanding of the molecular features driving RNase PNK nuclease activity, we generated a series of Las1 RφXXXH HEPN variants to determine the functional significance of each individual residue. Through a combination of in vivo studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in vitro activity assays, we determined that the flanking invariant arginine and histidine residues along with several intervening residues of the RφXXXH motif are critical for nuclease activity. Unexpectedly, we also discovered that conformational flexibility of the two HEPN domains contributes to nuclease fidelity. Restriction of the conformational flexibility of the two HEPN domains and alteration of the HEPN motif leads to off-target RNA cleavage products. Las1 is conserved across eukaryotes and encodes a six–amino acid RφXXXH motif within its HEPN domain. Previous work has established that the invariant arginine and histidine residues of RφXXXH are critical to support S. cerevisiae Las1 RNA cleavage in vitro and in vivo (14Gasse L. Flemming D. Hurt E.

To determine the significance of the entire Las1 RφXXXH HEPN motif, we curated over 300 unique Las1 orthologs from species spanning fungi to vertebrates and carried out a comprehensive sequence alignment. Analysis of the alignment encompassing the Las1 HEPN domain revealed a single well-conserved RφXXXH motif previously associated with Las1 nuclease activity (Fig. 2A). This led to the discovery that beyond the first arginine (Arg-1) and last histidine (His-6) residues found in all HEPN family nucleases, the intervening residues within the Las1 RφXXXH HEPN motif are also well-conserved. The second position within this motif is an invariant histidine (His-2), which fits with the general trend that HEPN nucleases often encode for a polar amino acid at this position (3Anantharaman V. Makarova K.S. Burroughs A.M. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. Comprehensive analysis of the HEPN superfamily: Identification of novel roles in intra-genomic conflicts, defense, pathogenesis and RNA processing.Biol. Direct. 2013; 8 (23768067): 1510.1186/1745-6150-8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the third position is a poorly conserved residue (X3) with a subtle preference for alanine and the fourth position has a strong preference for a hydrophobic amino acid (h4). Although a subset of plant Las1 homologs encode for a serine residue at the fifth position, the majority of Las1 homologs harbor a threonine (Thr-5). Based on this high sequence conservation, we define the consensus HEPN motif of the Las1 subfamily as RHXhTH (where X is any residue and h is a hydrophobic residue) (Fig. 2A). The structural architecture surrounding the Las1 RHXhTH motif reveals the molecular basis for its residue preference at each position. Our recent cryo-EM reconstructions of Chaetomium thermophilum RNase PNK revealed the juxtaposed Las1 RHXhTH motifs within the composite nuclease active site (Fig. 2B) (26Pillon M.C. Hsu A.L. Krahn J.M. Williams J.G. Goslen K.H. Sobhany M. Borgnia M.J. Stanley R.E. Cryo-EM reveals active site coordination within a multienzyme pre-rRNA processing complex.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Each Las1 RHXhTH motif is embedded within an α-helix that lies at the interface of the Las1 HEPN homodimer. By capturing multiple conformational states of RNase PNK, we revealed that His-2 is an important active site switch that toggles between nuclease active and inactive conformations (26Pillon M.C. Hsu A.L. Krahn J.M. Williams J.G. Goslen K.H. Sobhany M. Borgnia M.J. Stanley R.E. Cryo-EM reveals active site coordination within a multienzyme pre-rRNA processing complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2019; 26 (31488907): 830-83910.1038/s41594-019-0289-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In the active state, His-2 is pointed toward the center of the active site whereas His-2 is pointing away in the inactive state (Fig. 2B). Although His-2 undergoes a distinct conformational rearrangement, the remaining residues of the Las1 RHXhTH motif remain largely unchanged. In the nuclease active conformation, the four well-conserved residues of the RHXhTH motif (Arg-1, His-2, Thr-5, His-6) all point toward the nuclease active site, suggesting they each play an important role in catalysis (Fig. 2, B and C). The well-conserved Thr-5 lies at the base of the nuclease active site where it is within hydrogen bonding distance of His-6 and could contribute to the spatial positioning of His-6. The other two residues, which lie within the middle of the motif, are positioned away from the active site. The variable residue at the third position (CtLas1 Gln-3) points toward the broad cleft formed between the nuclease and kinase active sites of RNase PNK, explaining the lack of conservation at this position. Conversely, the hydrophobic residue at the fourth position (CtLas1 Ala-4) is buried in the Las1 HEPN–HEPN′ core and explains its strong preference for a nonpolar residue to preserve its native fold (Fig. 2, B and C). Together, the identification of the Las1 HEPN consensus RHXhTH motif, along with the recent structural characterization of RNase PNK, uncovers the molecular requirements for the Las1 composite HEPN nuclease active site. To investigate the functional significance of the Las1 RHXhTH motif, we disrupted the motif and monitored its functional effects in S. cerevisiae (15Castle C.D. Sardana R. Dandekar V. Borgianini V.

https://openalex.org/W3013633141,"Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is implicated in the pathogenesis of various acute intestinal injuries. Amniotic fluid stem cells (AFSC) are beneficial in experimental intestinal diseases. Tumor necrosis factor-induced protein 6 (TSG-6) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects. We aimed to investigate if AFSC secreted TSG-6 reduces inflammation and rescues intestinal I/R injury. The superior mesenteric artery of 3-week-old rats was occluded for 90 minutes and green fluorescent protein-labeled AFSC or recombinant TSG-6 was injected intravenously upon reperfusion. AFSC distribution was evaluated at 24, 48, and 72 hours after I/R. AFSC and TSG-6 effects on the intestine were assessed 48 hours postsurgery. Intestinal organoids were used to study the effects of TSG-6 after hypoxia-induced epithelial damage. After I/R-induced intestinal injury, AFSC migrated preferentially to the ileum, the primary site of injury, through blood circulation. Engrafted AFSC reduced ileum injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress. These AFSC-mediated beneficial effects were dependent on secretion of TSG-6. Administration of TSG-6 protected against hypoxia-induced epithelial damage in intestinal organoids. Finally, TSG-6 attenuated intestinal damage during I/R by suppressing genes involved in wound and injury pathways. This study indicates that AFSC or TSG-6 have the potential of rescuing the intestine from the damage caused by I/R."

We investigated whether calreticulin controls a switch between osteogenesis and chondrogenesis in mouse ESCs through NFATC1. We found that in the absence of calreticulin, intranuclear transport of NFATC1 is blocked and that differentiation switches from osteogenic to chondrogenic, a process that could be mimicked by chemical inhibition of NFAT translocation. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) deactivation and nuclear localization of β-catenin critical to osteogenesis were abrogated by calreticulin deficiency or NFAT blockade. Chemically induced GSK3β inhibition bypassed the calreticulin/calcineurin axis and increased osteoblast output from both control and calreticulin-deficient ESCs, while suppressing chondrogenesis. Calreticulin-deficient ESCs or cells treated with an NFAT blocker had enhanced expression of dickkopf WNT-signaling pathway inhibitor 1 (Dkk1), a canonical Wnt pathway antagonist that blocks GSK3β deactivation.

Minimally invasive screening programs that use peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are a new and reliable strategy that can achieve early detection of tumors by identifying marker genes. From 797 datasets, four (GSE12771, GSE24536, GSE27562, and GSE42834) including 428 samples, 236 solid tumor cases, and 192 healthy controls were chosen according to the inclusion criteria. A total of 285 genes from among 440 reported genes were selected by meta-analysis. Among them, 4 of the top significantly differentially expressed genes (ANXA1, IFI44, IFI44L, and OAS1) were identified as marker genes of PBMCs. Pathway enrichment analysis identified, two significant pathways, the 'primary immunodeficiency' pathway and the 'cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction' pathway. Protein- protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed the top 27 hubs with a degree centrality greater than 23 to be hub genes. We also identified 3 modules in Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) analysis: Cluster 1 (related to ANXA1), Cluster 2 (related to IFI44 and IFI44L) and Cluster 3 (related to OAS1). Among the 4 marker genes, IFI44, IFI44L, and OAS1 are potential diagnostic biomarkers, even though their results were not as remarkable as those for ANXA1 in our study. ANXA1 is involved in the immunosuppressive mechanism in tumor-bearing hosts and may be used in a new strategy involving the use of the host's own immunity to achieve tumor suppression."
https://openalex.org/W3013095581,"Background Air pollution has been associated with cognitive function and brain volume. While most previous research has examined the association between air pollution and brain volume in cortical structures or total brain volume, less research has investigated associations between exposure to air pollution and subcortical structures, including the thalamus. Further, the few available previous studies investigating associations between air pollution and thalamic volume have shown mixed results. Methods In this study, we evaluated the association between PM2.5, PM2.5–10, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxides and volume of the thalamus in adults using the UK Biobank resource, a large community-based sample, while adjusting for multiple covariates that could confound an association between air pollution and thalamic volume. Results In adjusted models, the left but not right thalamus volume was significantly inversely associated with PM2.5–10, although there were no significant associations between PM2.5, PM10, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxides with either left or right thalamic volumes. In addition, interactions between age and PM2.5–10 and PM10 were inversely associated with thalamic volume, such that thalamic volume in older people appeared more vulnerable to the adverse effects of PM2.5–10 and PM10, and interactions between educational attainment and PM2.5, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxides and between self-rated health and PM2.5–10 were positively associated with thalamic volume, such that higher educational attainment and better self-rated health appeared protective against the adverse effects of air pollution on the thalamus. Conclusion These findings suggest a possible association between thalamic volume and air pollution particularly in older people and in people with comparatively low educational attainment at levels of air pollution found in the United Kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W3013151716,"While movement patterns of grazing ungulates are strongly dependent on forage quality their use of nutrient hotspots such as termite mounds or grazing lawns has rarely been quantified, especially in savanna ecosystems where soil-nutrient quality is low. Additionally, few experiments have been conducted to determine the role of termite mound- and grazing lawn-derived soils in improving forage quality in the field. We studied wild ungulate grazing activities around ten termite mounds, six grazing lawns and their respective control sites in a Miombo system of Issa Valley, western Tanzania, in the same system. We used indirect observations (i.e., dung, tracks) to identify seasonal and spatial variations in habitat use of various wild mammalian grazers. Grazer visitation rates were nine and three times higher on termite mounds and grazing lawns, respectively, compared to control sites. During the rainy season, termite mounds were more frequently used than grazing lawns while the latter were used more often during the dry season. In an additional pot experiment with soils derived from different areas, we found that Cynodon dactylon in termite mound-derived soils had twice as high Nitrogen and Phosphorous contents and biomass compared to grasses planted in grazing lawn soils and control site soils. We highlight that both termite mounds and grazing lawns play a significant role in influencing seasonal nutrient dynamics, forage nutrient quality, habitat selectivity, and, hence, grazing activities and movement patterns of wild ungulate grazers in savannas. We conclude that termite mounds and grazing lawns are important for habitat heterogeneity in otherwise nutrient–poor savanna systems."

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cannabis smoking, pneumothorax and bullous lung disease in a population of operated patients.We performed a retrospective study on patients operated on for spontaneous pneumothorax. Patients were divided into three groups according to their smoking habit: cannabis smokers, only-tobacco smokers and nonsmokers. Cannabis lifetime exposure was expressed in dose-years (1d/y = 1 gram of cannabis/week for one year). Clinical, radiological and perioperative variables were collected. The variables were analyzed to find associations with smoking habit. The impact of the amount of cannabis consumption was also investigated by ROC curves analysis. Of 112 patients, 39 smoked cannabis, 23 smoked only tobacco and 50 were nonsmokers. Median cannabis consumption was 28 dose/years, median tobacco consumption was 6 pack/years. Cannabis smokers presented with more severe chronic respiratory symptoms and bullous lung disease and with a higher incidence of tension pneumothorax than both tobacco smokers and nonsmokers. Cannabis smokers also developed a larger pneumothorax, experienced prolonged postoperative stay and demonstrated a higher incidence of pneumothorax recurrence after the operation than nonsmokers did. The risk of occurrence of chronic respiratory symptoms and bullous lung disease in cannabis smokers was dose-related.Cannabis smoking seems to increase the risk of suffering from respiratory complaints and can have detrimental effects on lung parenchyma, in a dose-dependent manner. Cannabis smoking also negatively affected the outcome of patients operated for spontaneous pneumothorax. A history of cannabis abuse should always be taken in patients with pneumothorax. There may be need for a specific treatment for pneumothorax in cannabis smokers."

Morphological and histological analyses revealed unambiguous craniofacial phenotypes in mutants, where we observed skeletal malocclusion accompanied by markedly hypoplastic nasomaxillary complex and reversed incisor occlusion. Both the replacement of nasal concha cartilage by turbinate bones and the endochondral ossification of nasal septum ethmoid bone were substantially delayed. We also observed hypoplastic mandibles in mutants where the mandibular ramus was unexpectedly the most affected. Both the condylar process and mandibular angle cartilages were distorted. However, dental examination showed no significant changes in teeth and dentition. Finally, a comprehensive RNA sequence analysis utilizing condylar cartilage identified Ihh-associated gene network including several cell cycle genes and 16 genes related to the extracellular matrix, sulfate transporters, transcription factors, receptors, a ciliogenesis factor, and an adhesion molecule. Our data provide direct in vivo evidence that Ihh plays crucial roles in midface and masticatory system formation, likely by activating key genes."

There is limited empirical data on older adults’ understanding on KOA and their information needs about KOA. Therefore, the aims of this study were to explore older adults’ knowledge about KOA and their perspectives on the information required to enable self-management. Three focus groups were conducted with 16 older adults with KOA. The sample consisted of three men and thirteen women with the mean age 73.2 years (range from 61 to 89). Thematic content analysis revealed two themes which were understanding about KOA and information needed about KOA. Participants’ knowledge about KOA varied between individuals with many expressing that they needed more information about KOA. A targeted strategy is needed to educate older adults about KOA in order to support and prepare them for self-management."

In this study, first we show the elevated level of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in a gut microbiota dysbiosis mouse model. Second, we demonstrate that the diameter of muscle fibers, limb development, and somitogenesis were inhibited in both the gut microbiota dysbiosis and LPS exposed mice and chicken embryos. These might be due to LPS disturbed the cell survival and key genes which regulate the somitogenesis and myogenesis. RNA sequencing and subsequent validation experiments verified that retinoic acid (RA) signaling perturbation was mainly responsible for the aberrant somite formation and differentiation. Subsequently, we found that LPS-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS generation and antioxidant genes such as Nrf2, AKR1B10) contributed to the above -mentioned interference with RA signaling. These findings highlight that the gut microbiota homeostasis is also involved in regulating the development of muscle progenitor cells during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3013001007,"Introduction Physical activity level during pregnancy is unknown in Middle Eastern and North African countries, since no valid tools assessing it exist in Arabic. The aim of this study is to culturally adapt and translate to Arabic an internationally validated instrument, the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire (PPAQ), and to measure the physical activity of pregnant women using the adapted PPAQ, Arabic version. This tool is time-sparing, self-administered and is the only one taking into account childcare and household chores. Methods After following the guidelines for translation and back-translation by certified translators, a committee composed of professionals in the field reviewed each item of the PPAQ, for its comprehensibility. This Arabic version of the PPAQ was tested on a sample of 179 pregnant Lebanese women, from different educational backgrounds, socioeconomic status and gestational ages. Results Cross-cultural adaptations were applied on the newly translated PPAQ in Arabic version, thus questions referring to some types of outdoor activities were excluded from the final format. Our results reported that 51% and 1.7% of women engage respectively in light and high intensity physical activity, while 18% had a sedentary lifestyle. Occupational type of activities were significantly more performed by women having a higher education (p value 0.001), as opposed to those who attended only high school, who were physically more active in household activities (p value 0.038). Second trimester was a period where pregnant women were active for household, caregiving (p value 0.031), whereas women in their third trimester were physically more active in occupational activities (p value 0.001). Sport-oriented activities were performed by women reporting a good physical status (p value 0.03). Age and crowding index were significantly correlated with occupational, household and caregiving activities (p values 0.004, 0.008 respectively). No significant correlations were observed with pre-gestational body mass index and the physical activity levels. Conclusion A valid tool will help researchers in Arab countries identify physical activity levels of pregnant women and consequently emit specific guidelines relative to the importance and the benefits of a daily active lifestyle throughout gestation."
https://openalex.org/W3013355616,"The health of school-aged children (SAC) is often compromised by malaria parasitaemia (MP), soil-transmitted helminths (STH), and malnutrition in the tropics. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and influence of MP, STH and malnutrition on haemoglobin (Hb) levels as well as identify its predictors.This cross-sectional study was carried out in SAC (4-14 years) in Owe, Mpundu and Meanja villages in Muyuka, Southwest Cameroon. Hb concentration was measured using a URIT-12 Hb meter while MP and STH were determined by Giemsa staining of blood films and Kato-Katz technique respectively. Anthropometric measures (weight, height and mid upper arm circumference (MUAC)) of malnutrition (z-scores of <-2 standard deviations below mean) were obtained by standard methods. Categorical and continuous variables were compared appropriately, and multiple linear regression model was used to determine predictors of Hb level.The prevalence of MP, STH, anaemia and malnutrition in the 401 SAC examined were 33.9%, 2.2%, 75.3% and 24.4% respectively. The prevalence of MP varied significantly with locality (P = 0.031). Stunting occurred commonly (23.7%) and was significantly higher in males (28.6%), children 11-14 years old (38.3%) and those of Meanja locality (47.4%) than their counterparts. Significantly higher prevalence of anaemia was observed in children of Meanja (89.5%) and those both MP positive and malnourished (86.2%). Moderate anaemia occurred commonly (60.6%) and children ≤6 years old had significantly (P = 0.034) higher prevalence (75.0%). Mean Hb level varied significantly (P = 0.004) with age and those ≤6 years old infected with MP had significantly (P = 0.022) lower values. Significant predictors of Hb levels were the MUAC (P <0.001) and the MP status (P = 0.035). Based on the Hb level (>11g/dL) and the absence of MP, STH and malnutrition, 13.7% of the SAC were considered as healthy.The health of a majority of SAC is compromised by malaria, helminthiasis, malnutrition and other conditions not investigated. Anaemia is of major public health concern hence, intervention programmes that integrate malaria control with improvement of educational levels especially on proper nutrition and health care practices are desirable."
https://openalex.org/W3013462761,"Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) enables monitoring of trends in AMR prevalence. WHO recommends laboratory-based surveillance to obtain actionable AMR data at local or national level. However, laboratory-based surveillance may lead to overestimation of the prevalence of AMR due to bias. The objective of this study is to assess the difference in resistance prevalence between laboratory-based and population-based surveillance (PBS) among uropathogens in Indonesia. We included all urine samples submitted to the laboratory growing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae in the laboratory-based surveillance. Population-based surveillance data were collected in a cross-sectional survey of AMR in E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolated from urine samples among consecutive patients with symptoms of UTI, attending outpatient clinics and hospital wards. Data were collected between 1 April 2014 until 31 May 2015. The difference in percentage resistance (95% confidence intervals) between laboratory- and population-based surveillance was calculated for relevant antibiotics. A difference larger than +/- 5 percent points was defined as a biased result, precluding laboratory-based surveillance for guiding empirical treatment. We observed high prevalence of AMR ranging between 63.1% (piperacillin-tazobactam) and 85% (ceftriaxone) in laboratory-based surveillance and 41.3% (piperacillin-tazobactam) and 74.2% (ceftriaxone) in population-based surveillance, except for amikacin and meropenem (5.7%/9.8%; 10.8%/5.9%; [laboratory-/population-based surveillance], respectively). Laboratory-based surveillance yielded significantly higher AMR prevalence estimates than population-based surveillance. This difference was much larger when comparing surveillance data from outpatients than from inpatients. All point estimates of the difference between the two surveillance systems were larger than 5 percent points, except for amikacin and meropenem. Laboratory-based AMR surveillance of uropathogens, is not adequate to guide empirical treatment for community-based settings in Indonesia."

Here, using structural and biophysical methods, we demonstrate that the intact CshA repeat region (CshA_RD1–17, domains 1–17) forms an extended polymeric monomer in solution. We recombinantly produced a subset of CshA RDs and found that they differ in stability and unfolding behavior. The NMR structure of CshA_RD13 revealed a hitherto unreported all β-fold, flanked by disordered interdomain linkers.

In this study, using a combination of structural and biophysical methods, we show that the >175-kDa multidomain repeat region of CshA (CshA_RD1–17) adopts an elongated polymeric structure in solution, with a distinctive conformation dictated by the interplay of fully and partially ordered domains and intrinsically disordered regions. Equilibrium folding studies of individual CshA repeat domains reveal diversity in the stabilities and unfolding profiles of these proteins, despite their often considerable (>90%) sequence identities. The NMR structure of CshA_RD13 has been determined, which identifies a previously unreported all β-fold flanked on either terminus by unstructured linker regions. Complementary AUC and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) studies of CshA_RD1–17 provide support for the CshA repeat region adopting a transitory structure characterized by alternating regions of order and disorder. Together, our data suggest a molecular architecture within which individual repeat domains contribute additive strength to the intact polypeptide but also minimize the likelihood of domain misfolding that may arise as a consequence of high sequence and structural identity to adjacent RDs. This is enabled via the acquisition of destabilizing mutations that preclude the adoption of a fully folded state. Our work identifies a distinctive polymeric protein architecture and resolves the molecular intricacies of its structure and organization. In turn, this provides greater insight regarding the capacity for bacterial adhesins to promote colonization of sites within the host that are continuously exposed to the flow of blood, saliva, or tissue fluids. Consistent with previous domain assignments, the repeat region of CshA was considered to comprise residues 820–2500 of the 2507-amino acid full-length CshA polypeptide (21Back C.R. Sztukowska M.N.

The resulting construct was used to facilitate overexpression of an N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged variant of CshA_RD1–17 in Escherichia coli, and the resulting recombinant material was purified to homogeneity using a two-step process. CshA_RD1–17 was found to be a homogeneous, monodisperse species in solution, of >95% purity. Analysis of CshA_RD1–17 using CD spectroscopy, followed by deconvolution of the resulting spectrum into secondary structural elements, revealed the protein to be predominantly β-sheet (∼45%), with a significant disorder content (∼39%; Fig. 2A). Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation confirmed that the polypeptide is monomeric and adopts an extended configuration in solution with an f/f0 value of 2.84 (Fig. 2B and Table S2). Complementary SAXS analysis (Fig. 2C and Table S3) provided further evidence that CshA adopts an elongated structure, with a radius of gyration of 120 Å and maximum diameter of 408 Å, as derived from the pair distance distribution (P(r)) function (Fig. 2D). Structural disorder is apparent from the Kratky plot, which diverges from the baseline at high q, and the Porod exponent, which is lower than observed for a well-folded globular protein (Fig. 2E). The structural disorder evident from CD and SAXS analysis suggests a flexible dynamic structure, in keeping with the biological role of CshA. The measured scattering data are well-described by the flexible cylinder model (Fig. 2F and Table S4), in which CshA is characterized by a higher Kuhn length and lower contour length than that expected for a random coil. The large deviation from random coil behavior is consistent with a significant proportion of folded regions in the solution structure. These data imply that the polypeptide adopts an elongated, flexible ultrastructure in solution that occupies an ensemble of configurations. Having established the solution ultrastructure of CshA_RD1–17, we next sought to investigate the molecular origins of the polypeptide's physical properties. Comparative sequence analysis of assigned CshA repeat domains reveals considerable variation in the amino acid sequences of these regions (Fig. 3A and Fig. S1). The repeat region comprises a central core of domains with very high sequence identity (domains 3–14) punctuated by the deviant repeat domain 7. The sequence of this domain diverges significantly from those of the other 16 repeat domains that comprise the intact repeat region. Surprisingly, a significant number of adjacent domains located within the central 3–14 core exhibit high sequence identity. Domains 3 and 4, domains 5 and 6, domains 10 and 11, domains 11 and 12, and domains 12 and 13 share >90% sequence identity (Fig. 3A), an arrangement that contravenes current dogma regarding the organization of tandemly arrayed domains within multidomain proteins (24Borgia M.B. Borgia A. Best R.B. Steward A. Nettels D. Wunderlich B. Schuler B. Clarke J. Single-molecule fluorescence reveals sequence-specific misfolding in multidomain proteins.Nature. 2011; 474 (21623368): 662-66510.1038/nature10099Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The sequence identities of the terminal domains of CshA_RD1–17, namely 1, 15, 16, and 17, are significantly lower than those identified in the central core region. Interestingly, in addition to repeat domain 17, domains 6, 11, 12, and 13 all possess a C-terminal LPXTG cell-wall anchor motif, suggesting that evolutionary pressure to present the adhesive nonrepeat region of CshA at a maximal distance from the cell surface may have driven extension of the repeat region via gene duplication. In an effort to explore the structural significance of sequence variation between individual CshA repeat domains, a subset of these proteins were cloned, recombinantly overexpressed in E. coli, and purified to homogeneity using the same general strategy (Table S1). Representative domains were selected covering a breadth of amino acid sequences. These were repeat domains 1, 3, 5, 7, and 13. Each could be readily produced in high quantities and to high purities (>95%, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis). The stabilities and unfolding behaviors of each of these proteins were assessed in vitro by monitoring their unfolding in the presence of increasing concentrations of the chemical denaturant urea (Fig. 3B and Table 1). Unfolding behavior was monitored by intrinsic tyrosine fluorescence, exploiting the presence of at least one such residue in each of the repeats 1, 3, 5, 7, and 13. Of the isolated domains examined, CshA_RD13 exhibited the highest overall stability (−3.42 kcal mol−1), whereas remarkably, CshA_RD5 showed no fluorescence intensity change when titrated with urea, despite the 91% sequence identity with repeat 13, including the two tyrosine residues at precisely the same positions: 52 (residue Tyr2084) and 92 (residue Tyr2123) (Fig. S1). CD spectroscopy of repeat domain 5 also indicated that this domain was largely unstructured, even in the absence of urea (data not shown). Although CshA_RD3 and CshA_RD7 are less stable than CshA_RD13, they do exhibit a mildly cooperative unfolding transition, whereas CshA_RD1 is barely stable even in the absence of urea but also exhibits a weakly cooperative unfolding transition. Complementary size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analyses of individual CshA repeat domains provide further support for variability in the degree of foldedness of these proteins (Fig. S2). The largely unfolded CshA_RD5 elutes earlier from a SEC column than its better folded counterparts and significantly earlier than the well-folded CshA_RD13.Table 1Folding data for CshA repeat domainsDomainΔGD–NH2OmD–Nkcal mol−1kcal mol−1 m−1RD1−0.640.66RD3−1.531.17RD5RD7−1.471.24RD13−3.421.74 Open table in a new tab In an effort to provide a structural framework for the observed biophysical properties of CshA_RD1–17, CshA_RD13, which possesses the highest cross-domain sequence identity to all other CshA repeat domains (Fig. 3A), was selected for structure elucidation. Of the five single repeat domains produced recombinantly, CshA_RD13 has the greatest tolerance to urea unfolding, suggestive of high stability (Fig. 3B). The structure of this protein was determined using solution NMR (Fig. 4 and Figs. S3 and S4). Assignment proved challenging because of repetitive sequence motifs and a high degree of mobility leading to both the absence of some signals and the doubling (or more) of others (Fig. 4A). Nonetheless, a high degree of assignment was achieved for the core region of the protein covering residues 2053–2130 (Table 2). The N-terminal region (residues 2032–2052 plus a 19-residue tag) was found to be largely unstructured with few inter-residue NOEs and no unambiguously assignable long-range NOEs. For this reason, no structural restraints were included for this part of the sequence, and the structure was only calculated and validated for residues 2053–2130. In addition to the high degree of disorder in the N-terminal part of CshA_RD13, several other regions of slow exchange (ms) were detected. Two sets of NMR signals were observed for the initial N-terminal loop comprised of residues 2053–2062, of which only the major set was used for structure calculations. A hydrogen–deuterium exchange experiment showed that the Val2059 NH group is involved in a hydrogen bond that persists for over an hour, suggesting that interconversion between these conformations is either very slow or, more likely, that they are very similar and both involve a hydrogen bond between Val2059H and Asp2056O (as determined from initial structure calculations conducted without hydrogen bond restraints). Multiple conformations were also observed for residues Asp2113 and Asn2115, which lie in the β5-β6 loop. The β5-β6 loop lies adjacent to the N-terminal loop, suggesting that slow exchange between these two regions may be coupled. The β4-β5 loop (Pro2096–Pro2106) and C-terminal tail (Ser2124–Val2130) are both ill-defined in the structural ensemble (Fig. 4B), which is in part due to several broad, missing, or unassigned signals and thus a low density of structural restraints that might reflect the underlying dynamics of these regions. Several residues along the outside edge of the β3 and β5 strands have NOEs that could not be assigned to residues within the globular domain. Most likely these arise from interactions with the N-terminal tail of the protein, although no unambiguous assignment to particular residues was possible.Table 2NMR assignment, structure calculation, and validation statistics for CshA_RD13Degree of assignmentaResidues 2053–2130.

https://openalex.org/W3013181304,"Few studies exist that document how high-elevation Andean ecosystems recover naturally after the cessation of human activities and this can limit the implementation of cost-effective restoration actions. We assessed Andean forest (Polylepis stands) and páramo grassland recovery along an elevation gradient (3,600–4,350 m.a.s.l.) in the Yanacocha Reserve (Ecuador) where natural recovery has been allowed since 1995. Within the Yanacocha Reserve in 2012 and 2014 the aboveground biomass (AGB), aboveground necromass (AGN) and belowground biomass (BGB) carbon (C) stocks were measured and C sequestration rates calculated as proxy of ecosystem recovery. The soil organic carbon (SOC) stock to 36-cm depth was also quantified during the 2012 survey. To explore potential drivers of spatiotemporal variation of the forest and páramo C stocks they were related to abiotic and biotic variables. Andean forest C stocks were influenced mainly by disturbance history and tree-species composition. Páramo C stocks´ spatial variation were related to the elevation gradient; we found a positive significant trend in páramo AGB-C stocks with elevation, whereas we found a significant negative trend in AGN-C stocks. Likewise, significant temporal changes were found for AGB-C and AGN-C stocks. Net increases in AGB-C stocks were the largest in the Andean forest and páramo, 2.5 Mg C ha-1 year-1 and 1.5 Mg C ha-1 year-1 respectively. Carbon sequestration rates were partly explained by environmental variables. In the Andean forest, plots with low dominance of Baccharis padifolia were observed to present higher AGB-C and lower BGB-C sequestration rates. In the páramo, higher sequestration rates for AGB-C were found at higher elevations and associated with higher levels of growth-forms diversity. Temporal changes in BGB-C stocks on the contrary were non-significant. Our results indicated that terrestrial aboveground C sequestration rates might be an appropriate indicator for assessing Andean forest and páramo recovery after human disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W3013462602,"The developing nervous system is remarkably sensitive to environmental signals, including disruptive toxins, such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). PBDEs are an environmentally pervasive class of brominated flame retardants whose neurodevelopmental toxicity mechanisms remain largely unclear. Using dissociated cortical neurons from embryonic Rattus norvegicus, we found here that chronic exposure to 6-OH–BDE-47, one of the most prevalent hydroxylated PBDE metabolites, suppresses both spontaneous and evoked neuronal electrical activity. On the basis of our previous work on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) (MEK) biology and our observation that 6-OH–BDE-47 is structurally similar to kinase inhibitors, we hypothesized that certain hydroxylated PBDEs mediate neurotoxicity, at least in part, by impairing the MEK–ERK axis of MAPK signal transduction. We tested this hypothesis on three experimental platforms: 1) in silico, where modeling ligand–protein docking suggested that 6-OH–BDE-47 is a promiscuous ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor; 2) in vitro in dissociated neurons, where 6-OH–BDE-47 and another specific hydroxylated BDE metabolite similarly impaired phosphorylation of MEK/ERK1/2 and activity-induced transcription of a neuronal immediate early gene; and 3) in vivo in Drosophila melanogaster, where developmental exposures to 6-OH–BDE-47 and a MAPK inhibitor resulted in offspring displaying similarly increased frequency of mushroom-body β–lobe midline crossing, a metric of axonal guidance. Taken together, our results support that certain ortho-hydroxylated PBDE metabolites are promiscuous kinase inhibitors and can cause disruptions of critical neurodevelopmental processes, including neuronal electrical activity, pre-synaptic functions, MEK–ERK signaling, and axonal guidance.

Concerningly, a substantial amount of research has established the relationship of PBDE exposure levels with behavioral deficits in humans, as well as in animal models.

Given the prevalence of these compounds and their association with behavioral deficits, it is imperative to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying PBDE neurotoxicity. Exposure to PBDEs has been shown to have numerous effects on neural cells, which are thoroughly reviewed elsewhere (21Costa L.G. de Laat R. Tagliaferri S. Pellacani C.

Several of the major known mechanisms of PBDE toxicity include the following: 1) interference with endocrine signaling, likely caused by structural similarities to thyroid hormones and other hormone receptors' ligands (22Sueyoshi T.

It is possible that one or more of these molecular mechanisms contribute to exposure-related behavioral abnormalities; however, the extent of their involvement, if any, remains unclear. The complex nature of the effects of these toxins is likely due in part to their diversity; there are 209 PBDE congeners, many found in commercial flame-retardant mixtures, and these compounds can be further endogenously metabolized in our cells.

In addition to parent congeners, toxicity may also arise from these metabolic products of PBDEs, some of which (e.g. 6-OH–BDE-47) have been found to be more toxic than the parent compound (25Dingemans M.M. van den Berg M. Westerink R.H. Neurotoxicity of brominated flame retardants: (In)direct effects of parent and hydroxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers on the (Developing) nervous system.Environ.

Given the numerous PBDEs to which humans are exposed, including these metabolized forms, understanding how the effects of exposures to various PBDEs impact neurodevelopmental processes has been a difficult process, and it is likely that unreported mechanisms are involved. Previously, we have utilized the ability of neurons to induce gene transcription in response to elevated network activity as a tool for assessing developmental PBDE toxicity (38Poston R.G. Dunn C.J. Sarkar P. Saha R.N. Persistent 6-OH–BDE-47 exposure impairs functional neuronal maturation and alters expression of neurodevelopmentally-relevant chromatin remodelers.Environ. Epigenet. 2018; 4 (29765770): dvx02010.1093/eep/dvx020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, we assayed levels of the neuron-specific activity-induced immediate early gene (IEG) Arc after exposing embryonic cortical neurons across various stages of differentiation and maturation. Our rationale for employing this end point was that Arc induction relies on multiple levels of regulation, from electrical activity and synaptic function to intracellular signaling (particularly Ca2+-dependent mechanisms) and to nuclear regulation of gene expression, all of which are critical processes intertwined in regulating neurodevelopment (39Spitzer N.C. Electrical activity in early neuronal development.Nature. 2006; 444 (17151658): 707-71210.1038/nature05300Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). These processes are largely hardwired by genetic programs but are also modulated by environmental cues. Exposure to toxins like PBDEs represents an environmental challenge that may dysregulate these processes at multiple levels, the cumulative effects of which could be detected as altered transcriptional responses. Results from our previous study showed that chronic exposures to a hydroxylated metabolite of BDE-47, 6-OH–BDE-47 (6-OH), dysregulate basal and activity-dependent neuronal transcription. Among those findings were data that strongly indicated that the attenuated transcriptional response following 6-OH exposure is due to synaptic dysfunction and that 6-OH is potentially capable of inhibiting intracellular signaling. Either could explain the attenuated transcription of Arc, as its activity-induced transcription relies on synaptic activity as well as signaling via the MAPK cascade, one of the major signaling pathways that is important for neuronal plasticity (40Thomas G.M. Huganir R.L. MAPK cascade signalling and synaptic plasticity.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5 (14976517): 173-18310.1038/nrn1346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is necessary for Arc induction (41Tyssowski K.M. DeStefino N.R. Cho J.-H. Dunn C.J. Poston R.G. Carty C.E.

In this study, we propose and test a novel mechanism of PBDE metabolite toxicity via impairment of MEK–ERK signaling. The notion that a PBDE metabolite could have the capacity to impair MAPK signaling was of particular interest to us for several reasons. The MAPK pathway is a deeply evolutionarily–conserved intracellular signaling mechanism that supports diverse processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (42Pérez J. Castañeda-García A.

https://openalex.org/W3014065676,"Nuclear YAP1 plays a critical role in regulation of stem cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, and organ size in many types of epithelia. Due to rapid turnover of most epithelial cell types, the cytoplasmic function of YAP1 in epithelial cells has not been well studied. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is a highly polarized epithelial cell type maintained at a senescence state, and offers an ideal cell model to study the active role of YAP1 in maintenance of the adult epithelial phenotype. Here, we show that the cytoplasmic function of YAP1 is essential to maintain adult RPE differentiation. Knockout of Yap1 in the adult mouse RPE caused cell depolarization and tight junction breakdown, and led to inhibition of RPE65 expression, diminishment of RPE pigments, and retraction of microvilli and basal infoldings. These changes in RPE further prompted the loss of adjacent photoreceptor outer segments and photoreceptor death, which eventually led to decline of visual function in older mice between 6 and 12 months of age. Furthermore, nuclear β-catenin and its activity were significantly increased in mutant RPE. These results suggest that YAP1 plays an important role in active inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and is essential for downregulation of β-catenin nuclear activity and prevention of dedifferentiation of adult RPE."

In a three-year long fertilization experiment in switchgrass (SG: Panicum virgatum L.) and gamagrass (GG: Tripsacum dactyloides L.) croplands in Middle Tennessee USA, soil samples (0–15cm) were collected in plots with no N input (NN), low N input (LN: 84 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in urea) and high N input (HN: 168 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in urea). Besides SOC and TN, the aboveground plant biomass was also quantified. In addition to a summary of published root morphology data based on a separated mesocosm experiment, the root leachable dissolved organic matter (DOM) of both crops was also measured using archived samples. Results showed no significant interaction of N fertilization and crop type on SOC, TN or plant aboveground biomass (ABG). Relative to NN, HN (not LN) significantly increased SOC and TN in both crops. Though SG showed a 15–68% significantly higher ABG than GG, GG showed a 9.3–12% significantly higher SOC and TN than SG. The positive linear relationships of SOC or TN with ABG were identified for SG. However, GG showed structurally more complex and less readily decomposed root DOM, a larger root volume, total root length and surface area than SG. Collectively, these suggested that intensive N fertilization could increase C and N stocks in bioenergy cropland soils but these effects may be more likely mediated by the aboveground biomass in SG and root chemistry and morphology in GG. Future studies are expected to examine the root characteristics in different bioenergy croplands under the field fertilization experiment."

Better assessment of both risks and effects of exposure would permit improvements in the management of healthcare waste. However, there is not yet clear understanding of risks, and as consequences, inadequate management practices are often implemented.This study primarily aims to assess risk perception towards healthcare waste and secondly to assess knowledge, attitude and identify the factors associated with risk perception.A cross-sectional community based study was carried out among 270 respondents selected through multistage sampling technique. Face-to-face interview was conducted using semi-structured questionnaires. Risk perception was classified as good and poor based on mean score. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to determine the associates of risk perception. More than half, 52% of the sampled population had a poor risk perception towards healthcare waste. More than a quarter 26.3% had inadequate knowledge and forty percent (40%) had a negative attitude towards health care waste management. Having knowledge (OR = 3.31; CI = 1.67-6.58) was a strong predictor of risk perception towards healthcare waste. The perception of risk towards healthcare waste among community people was poor. This highlights the need for extensive awareness programs. Promoting knowledge on healthcare waste is a way to change the perception in Nepal.

https://openalex.org/W3014056340,"Angiogenesis, the main mechanism that allows vascular expansion for tissue regeneration or disease progression, is often triggered by an imbalance between oxygen consumption and demand. Here, by analyzing changes in the transcriptomic profile of endothelial cells (ECs) under hypoxia we uncovered that the repression of cell cycle entry and DNA replication stand as central responses in the early adaptation of ECs to low oxygen tension. Accordingly, hypoxia imposed a restriction in S-phase in ECs that is mediated by Hypoxia-Inducible Factors. Our results indicate that the induction of angiogenesis by hypoxia in Embryoid Bodies generated from murine Stem Cells is accomplished by the compensation of decreased S-phase entry in mature ECs and differentiation of progenitor cells. This conditioning most likely allows an optimum remodeling of the vascular network. Identification of the molecular underpinnings of cell cycle arrest by hypoxia would be relevant for the design of improved strategies aimed to suppress angiogenesis in pathological contexts where hypoxia is a driver of neovascularization."

The new knowledge on endometriosis has highlighted the value of secondary prevention through the early diagnosis and treatment of lesions to reduce serious consequences, first of all, infertility and chronic pelvic pain. The purpose of this study is to assess the reliability and validity of the questionnaire, as a tool to precociously identify women with endometriosis, to prevent the progression of symptoms. Method We reviewed the literature and selected risk factors, symptoms, and phenotypic traits of the women affected by endometriosis to create the questionnaire divided into 8 modules, with 47 questions. A total of 151 women completed the questionnaires: 51 patients who have endometriosis (the cases) and 100 matched women without endometriosis (the controls). After data collection, bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. Results We retained four of the significant variables from a step-down logistic regression, namely chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia with VAS≥3, painful defecation, and acne, to develop a final “predictive” logistic model achieving 90.2% sensitivity and 75% specificity.

Originally developed for applications to violent crime analysis, RTM is utilized here to analyze Dr. John Snow’s data from the 1854 cholera outbreak in London to demonstrate its potential value to contemporary epidemiological investigations. Dr. Snow saved countless lives when he traced the source of the cholera outbreak to a specific water pump through inductive reasoning, which he communicated through maps and spatial evidence. His methods have since inspired several fields of scientific inquiry. Informed by the extant research on RTM, we speculated that it could have helped test Dr. Snow’s hypothesis about cholera and empirically identified the sole source of contaminated well water. We learned that it could and, although it was not available to Dr. Snow in the 1800s, we discuss RTM’s implications for present-day research and practice as it relates to the analysis, prevention and treatment of cholera and other public health threats around the world."

Anerobiosis, life without air, was the focus of my work during my first postdoctoral position at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with the legendary Earl R. Stadtman. That experience led to a second postdoctoral fellowship in the laboratory of Konrad Bloch at Harvard, where one of the goals was to understand how anaerobes make unsaturated fatty acids. The lipids of anaerobes have remained an object of fascination for many years. But I am getting ahead of myself. First some background of how I got from Brooklyn, New York, to those eminent institutions. My parents were Samuel and Ida Cohen Goldfine. Sam had immigrated to this country from Vilnius, Lithuania, around 1900, joining three brothers and a sister. My dad was not forthcoming about his early life and, regretfully, I did not inquire. By the time I was born, he had owned and lost a millinery business in the Great Depression, had three children, and lost his first wife to cancer. He then married my mother, who was 10 years younger. My mother had also come to America from Eastern Europe. Her father was a potter in the city of Augustow in northeastern Poland. Her two sisters and two brothers had also emigrated near the turn of the last century. After moves from Brooklyn to Manhattan and then back, my family settled in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn to be near one of my aunts. At that time, Brownsville was a predominantly Jewish neighborhood, about 30 minutes by subway from midtown Manhattan. After completing elementary school and junior high, I was ready to enter 10th grade and took the test to go to Stuyvesant High School, then, as now, one of the preeminent schools in the city, dedicated to science education. I was accepted and rode the subway for about 4 days before deciding I would rather go to my local high school, Thomas Jefferson. I cannot recall the feeling I had at age 14 that Stuyvesant was not a good fit for me; despite the disapproval of an assistant to the principal at Jefferson, I made the move and have never regretted it. When I eventually matriculated at the City College of New York (CCNY), I found myself in classes with former classmates who had graduated from Stuyvesant and never felt that my education at Jefferson was lacking. At that time, New York City high schools had many excellent teachers who joined the profession during the Great Depression for economic reasons. During my teenage years, I, like many microbiologists of my generation, read Paul de Kruif's book Microbe Hunters and was inspired by his romantic descriptions of the lives of eminent microbiologists, including Louis Pasteur, Robert Koch, Walter Reed, and David Bruce. In my high school yearbook, I noted my ambition to become a bacteriologist. City College had students from all five boroughs and many ethnicities. It had strong departments in the sciences, and I enrolled as a biology major. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to take many courses in chemistry as well. Although traveling to City College required a long ride on the subway, I usually had a seat and spent the time studying and reading books. City College had been a hotbed of leftist thinking in the turbulent 1930s, but the postwar influx of WWII veterans resulted in a much less strident liberalism, which suited my temperament. As I entered my senior year in 1952, I was drawn to biochemistry by three members of the chemistry department: Benjamin Harrow, chair of the department, Ernest Borek, and most importantly Abraham (Abe) Mazur. Abe was responsible for stimulating a large number of City students to pursue graduate studies in biochemistry. Among these were Ted Breitman, Nathan Brot, Alan Peterkofsky, Jack Preiss, and the two Weissbach brothers, Arthur and Herbert (Fig. 1). He believed correctly that biochemistry would play an increasingly important role in the development of the biological sciences. He parceled his promising students out to biochemistry departments that contained former students or colleagues, and he advised me to apply to the University of Chicago, where several people he knew were among the biochemistry faculty. I also applied to and was accepted at several other strong institutions, but with Abe's guidance I chose Chicago. Aside from summer jobs in the Catskills (the so-called Borscht Belt) and in the Adirondacks, I had never been away from home without a parent, but to me Chicago was just another big city. Biochemistry at the university was housed in the well-worn Abbott Hall, and several courses like biochemistry and physiology were taken with first-year medical students. The department was led by Earl A. Evans, Jr., who had shown that animal cells could fix CO2 to form carbohydrates. He appointed a number of outstanding biochemists, including Albert Lehninger, Eugene Kennedy, and future Nobel Laureate Konrad Bloch. Within the department, he had formed a bacteriophage group under the sponsorship of the March of Dimes, which included Lloyd Kozloff and Frank Putnam. The University of Chicago had been the site of the first sustained nuclear chain reaction, led by Enrico Fermi, which led to strong emphasis on the use of radioisotopes to study biochemical reactions and pathways. During my second year, I looked around for potential thesis advisors and had an interview with Eugene Kennedy, who was just establishing his reputation with the discovery that CTP played an intrinsic role in phospholipid biosynthesis in animal tissues through the formation of CDP-choline. Gene said he did not have space for a graduate student, and I suspect he did not think I would be a good fit. I next applied to Evans, who told me that he wanted to branch out from phage work to do research on the polio virus, since the March of Dimes—formed under the aegis of President Franklin D. Roosevelt—was dedicated to finding a cure or at least a way to prevent polio. We discussed setting up a new laboratory in the Fermi Institute in space recently vacated by Harold Urey. I would have a small laboratory with a tissue culture room and a full-time technician, and I would share an office with Ray Koppelman, who had completed his Ph.D. in biochemistry in the phage group. Ray was no longer interested in doing research and was dedicating himself to teaching undergraduates. He would keep an eye on me and, I assume, report back to Evans. Before starting work with live polio virus, I learned how to grow HeLa cells, which had only recently been shown to be useful for studies on animal viruses. The cells were obtained from another university laboratory; no commercial sources were available in 1955. We started by making our own Eagle's medium using calf serum that I obtained at a local slaughterhouse. My initial studies were on the metabolism of cells grown in culture, and I, not surprisingly, found that HeLa cells, like other cancer cells, carried out robust glycolysis and produced large amounts of lactic acid. Having gained confidence that I could continue the cultivation of HeLa cells, I began the study of nucleic acid synthesis in cells infected with polio virus. These studies resulted in a thin (by present-day standards) thesis and a paper in the Journal of Biological Chemistry (1Goldfine H. Koppelman R. Evans Jr., E.A. Nucleoside incorporation into HeLa cells infected with poliomyelitus virus.J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 232 (13549443): 57-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after infection of HeLa cells with polio virus, RNA synthesis continued, but DNA synthesis shut down. Months before completing my thesis, I began to consider where I would go for postdoctoral studies. I considered working with, among others, H. A. Barker at Berkeley, Arthur Kornberg (then) at Washington University, and Earl Stadtman at the NIH. I met Earl at a Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology Meeting in Chicago and inquired about the possibility of joining his laboratory. He said he could accommodate me, but I would have to obtain my own funding. I briefly considered a commission in the Public Health Service but was told that, if I accepted it, I would be assigned to another laboratory. So in January 1958, I moved to the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland, and joined the Stadtman lab in the basement of building 3, having obtained a postdoctoral fellowship from the NIH. Earl and his wife, Thressa (Terry), had separate research programs, but their common interest in the physiology of anaerobic bacteria resulted in joint laboratory meetings and shared social interactions (Fig. 2). They had no children, and their lives revolved around their research. Earl was very soft-spoken and—although I did not realize it at the time—I was beginning to lose hearing in one ear, which made communication difficult. We settled on studies of the conversion of β-alanine to propionic acid by Clostridium propionicum. Roy Vagelos had been working on propionic acid formation in the laboratory, and Earl suggested I start by learning how to do a tetrazolium dye reduction assay from Roy, which began a lifelong friendship. Several lines of evidence indicated that β-hydroxypropionate is an intermediate between β-alanine and acrylyl-CoA, which is then reduced to propionyl-CoA (2Goldfine H. Stadtman E.R. Propionic acid metabolism. 5. Conversion of β-alanine to propionic acid by cell-free extracts of Clostridium propionicum.J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235 (13850646): 2238-2245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent work indicates that the first step after formation of β-alanyl-CoA is direct deamination leading to acrylyl-CoA rather than a transamination leading to the formation of β-hydroxypropionate, thence to acrylyl-CoA (3Heine A. Herrmann G. Selmer T. Terwesten F. Buckel W. Reuter K. High resolution crystal structure of Clostridium propionicum β-alanyl-CoA: ammonia lyase, a new member of the “hot dog fold” protein superfamily.Proteins. 2014; 82 (24623648): 2041-205310.1002/prot.24557Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Some time after I had settled into the Stadtman laboratory, I received a call from Konrad Bloch, who asked to meet with me when he was visiting the NIH campus. During lunch, he told me how his work on the aerobic formation of unsaturated fatty acids in eukaryotes had led to an interest in the formation of unsaturated fatty acids in anaerobic bacteria. He invited me to visit his laboratory at Harvard, which I did before the summer of 1959. After that visit, Konrad asked me to join his group as a senior postdoctoral fellow, which I agreed to do in the autumn of that year after my work in the Stadtman laboratory was completed. The Bloch laboratory had just moved into the newly built Conant laboratory building adjacent to the rest of the chemistry department. My laboratory mates were two graduate students, Marjorie Lindberg and Roger Childs. Further down the hall were Bill Lennarz (another new postdoctoral fellow), and Anne Norris (another graduate student), soon to be joined by Armand Fulco, a postdoctoral fellow. John Law's group occupied one of the adjacent laboratories. John was at the time an assistant professor appointed to complement the work of Konrad Bloch. At first I thought I would tackle a big problem, the morphogenesis of mitochondria, especially the formation or import of lipids. It soon became apparent that this effort was not going well, and Bloch was aware of this. We then discussed moving to a different problem. He asked: If eukaryotic organisms like yeast require molecular oxygen to desaturate saturated fatty acids, how do anaerobes produce unsaturated fatty acids (UFA)? 2The abbreviations used are: UFAunsaturated fatty acid(s)ACPacyl carrier proteinCFAcyclopropane fatty acid(s)DGDAGdiglucosyldiacylglycerolGAPlsEtnglycerolacetal of PlsEtnLmListeria monocytogenesMGDAGmonoglucosyldiacylglycerolPIphosphatidylinositolPLCphospholipase CPI-PLCphosphatidylinositol-specific PLCPlsEtnplasmenylethanolaminePtd-N-methylEtnphosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolaminePtdEtnphosphatidylethanolaminePtdSerphosphatidylserinePtdGrophosphatidylglyceroltstemperature-sensitiveLPSlipopolysaccharideDAGdiacylglycerolPKCprotein kinase CLLOlisteriolysin O. Indeed, do they even synthesize UFA? Since UFA are required for the growth of Clostridium butyricum in the absence of biotin (4Broquist H.P. Snell E.E. Biotin and bacterial growth. I. Relation to aspartate, oleate, and carbon dioxide.J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 188 (14814155): 431-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to study that organism. Twenty years later, my wife, Norah C. Johnston, and I found that the strain we worked with then and later should have been classified as Clostridium beijerinckii. Great efforts were taken to ensure that the cultures had no molecular oxygen, and we quickly showed that C. beijerinckii produced UFA anaerobically. In a series of experiments with isotopically labeled short chain carboxylic acids, we found that those shorter than C12 gave rise to both saturated fatty acids and UFA, but longer chains were incorporated only into saturated fatty acids (5Goldfine H. Bloch K. On the origin of unsaturated fatty acids in clostridia.J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236 (13899759): 2596-2601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Scheuerbrandt G. Goldfine H. Baronowsky P. Bloch K. A novel mechanism for the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids.J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236 (14498314): PC70-PC71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pathway proposed, involving the introduction of the double bond at the C8 or C10 stage of chain elongation, is now recognized as the primary mechanism used by prokaryotes, even those that are strictly aerobic or, like Escherichia coli, facultatively anaerobic. These papers recently were recognized as classics by the Journal of Biological Chemistry (7Spiering M.J. The work of Konrad Bloch's laboratory on unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in bacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294 (31604836): 14876-1487810.1074/jbc.CL119.010972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). unsaturated fatty acid(s) acyl carrier protein cyclopropane fatty acid(s) diglucosyldiacylglycerol glycerolacetal of PlsEtn Listeria monocytogenes monoglucosyldiacylglycerol phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC plasmenylethanolamine phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylserine phosphatidylglycerol temperature-sensitive lipopolysaccharide diacylglycerol protein kinase C listeriolysin O. During my time with Bloch, I discovered that the strain of C. beijerinckii we were using had an unusual phospho-N-methylethanolamine headgroup as a major lipid. In our attempts to obtain N-methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) in cell extracts using methyl-labeled SAM as the methyl donor, I found that radioactivity was incorporated into the phospholipid fraction, not into the headgroup, but rather into the hydrocarbon chains. Howard Zalkin, a postdoctoral fellow with John Law, was trying to obtain the formation of cyclopropane fatty acids (CFA) using cell extracts of various bacteria that had CFA. I quickly told him about my finding, and he confirmed that extracts of C. beijerinckii readily formed CFA and that the reaction probably took place with intact phospholipids (8Zalkin H. Law J.H. Goldfine H. Enzymatic synthesis of cyclopropane fatty acids catalyzed by bacterial extracts.J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238 (14003136): 1242-1248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 1961, after 2 years in the Bloch laboratory, I began to look for a faculty position. Fortunately, Bernard Davis, chair of microbiology at Harvard Medical School, was looking for a junior faculty member with experience in bacterial membranes and lipids. In the summer of 1962, I moved across the Charles River and started my own laboratory. I was very fortunate to have two postdoctoral fellows join me then: Nicole Baumann, from Paris, France, had had some postdoctoral experience at Columbia University, and Per-Otto Hagen, a Norwegian, had trained in Edinburgh, Scotland, and then with Morris Kates in Ottawa. Kates was one of the pre-eminent lipid biochemists in North America. A technician, Martha Ellis, completed my team funded through the NIH. We immediately began work on the formation of plasmalogens in C. beijerinckii. Other researchers had shown that some anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria contained plasmalogens (1-alk-1′-enyl, 2-acyl phospholipids), and we had found them in C. beijerinckii, the first finding of ether lipids in a Gram-positive organism. In an early experiment, we examined the kinetics of labeling of the polar lipids of C. beijerinckii in a 20-liter carboy pulsed with 5 mCi of 32Pi. An experiment like that would horrify my colleagues today and would be closely monitored for radiation safety at Penn. We separated the lipid classes by preparative TLC and distinguished the plasmalogens, which are relatively alkali-stable and acid-labile, from the diacyl phospholipids. It was clear that the diacyl lipids were labeled first, followed by the plasmalogens after a 5–10-min lag, suggesting that the diacyl compounds might be precursors of the ether lipids. Similar results were obtained upon labeling with radioactive acetate (9Baumann N.A. Hagen P.-O. Goldfine H. Phospholipids of Clostridium butyricum: studies on plasmalogen composition and biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240 (14285491): 1559-1567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hagen P.-O. Goldfine H. Phospholipids of Clostridium butyricum. III. Further studies on the origin of the aldehyde chains of plasmalogens.J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242 (5633398): 5700-5708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hagen provided an additional clue. Long-chain aldehydes and long-chain fatty acids were readily incorporated into the alk-1-enyl chains of plasmalogens in C. beijerinckii. When labeled with tritium on C-1 of the aldehyde, some of the label was incorporated into the alk-1-enyl chains, indicating that there was direct incorporation in addition to the presumed incorporation by way of the sn-1 acyl chain (10Hagen P.-O. Goldfine H. Phospholipids of Clostridium butyricum. III. Further studies on the origin of the aldehyde chains of plasmalogens.J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242 (5633398): 5700-5708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Efforts to synthesize plasmalogens with cell-free extracts were not successful; however, we were able to show that the acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate is stimulated by the addition of reduced acyl carrier protein (ACP) generously provided by Konrad Bloch. Roy Vagelos and Gérard Ailhaud, at Washington University in St. Louis, were working along similar lines and observed that E. coli membrane preparations can catalyze the acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate with palmitoyl-CoA, yielding lysophosphatidic and phosphatidic acid, or with palmitoyl-ACP, leading to the formation of monopalmitin. Since our system appeared to require acyl-ACP and did not work with acyl-CoA, we decided to join forces. Roy sent Ailhaud, an experienced postdoctoral fellow, to Boston. He purified ACP from C. beijerinckii and prepared palmitoyl-ACPCb. Acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate by membrane preparations required acyl-ACP and was inactive with palmitoyl-CoA. Thus, a clear distinction was drawn between eukaryotic organisms that use acyl-CoA in the formation of phosphatidic acid and prokaryotic organisms, such as C. beijerinckii, E. coli, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides (11Lueking D.R. Goldfine H. sn-Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity in particulate preparations from anaerobic, light-grown cell of Rhodopseudomonas spheroides: the involvement of acyl thiolester derivatives of acyl carrier protein in complex lipid synthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250 (387): 8530-8535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that use acyl-ACP. Later work by Charles Rock and colleagues has shown that in most prokaryotes, the acyl chain of acyl-ACP is transferred to Pi to form acyl-P, which then serves as the direct donor of acyl chains to glycerol 3-phosphate (12Zhang Y.-M. Rock C.O. Acyltransferases in bacterial glycerophospholipid synthesis.J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49 (18369234): 1867-187410.1194/jlr.R800005-JLR200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Around 1966, I had begun to receive invitations to visit other universities that were actively recruiting new faculty. One of these was the University of Pennsylvania, where Harold Ginsburg, co-author of an important textbook of microbiology with Bernard Davis, was chair of the microbiology department at the medical school. I decided that his offer of an associate professorship with tenure was the best fit for me and our growing family. But first, I had arranged for a sabbatical year in Bill Hayes' laboratory of microbial genetics at Hammersmith Hospital in London. There, I set out to isolate temperature-sensitive (ts) E. coli mutants with defects in lipid biosynthesis. A clever published technique allowed me to directly subject cells grown with 32Pi to paper chromatography, to visualize the separated lipids by autoradiography. Of 500 ts mutants, several were promising. When I began work at Penn, Karim Hechemy and Seamus Rooney, postdoctoral fellows who arrived soon after my new laboratory opened, began to examine these ts mutants in detail. We found that one of these mutants had a temperature-sensitive defect in the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid, the first indication that there are separate enzymes for this step and the initial acylation of glycerol 3-phosphate (13Hechemy K. Goldfine H. Isolation and characterization of a temperature-sensitive mutant of Escherichia coli with a lesion in the acylation of lysophosphatidic acid.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 42 (4925707): 245-25110.1016/0006-291X(71)90094-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Chromatographic analysis of lipids from another promising mutant revealed a new spot on autoradiographs, and Rooney's work revealed that it was a heptose-deficient form of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (14Rooney S.A. Goldfine H. Isolation and characterization of 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate-lipid A from a heptose-deficient mutant of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1972; 111 (4559734): 531-54110.1128/JB.111.2.531-541.1972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Jane Koplow, a graduate student, separated inner and outer membranes of the mutant E. coli cells and found that the outer membrane had very low amounts of several proteins, now known as porins (15Koplow J. Goldfine H. Alterations in the outer membrane of the cell envelope of heptose-deficient mutants of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117 (4590475): 527-54310.1128/JB.117.2.527-543.1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hiroshi Nikaido's laboratory at Berkeley had independently made a similar observation with heptose-deficient mutants of Salmonella (16Ames G.F. Spudich E.N. Nikaido H. Protein composition of outer membrane of Salmonella typhimurium: effect of lipopolysaccharide mutations.J. Bacteriol. 1974; 117 (4590466): 406-41610.1128/JB.117.2.406-416.1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forty years later, the connection between LPS biosynthesis and outer membrane protein export is much better understood (17Konovalova A. Kahne D.E. Silhavy T.J. Outer Membrane Biogenesis.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2017; 71 (28886680): 539-55610.1146/annurev-micro-090816-093754Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In a study of the fatty acids of C. beijerinckii with Charles Panos, we found that the CFA synthase was highly specific for the position of the double bond, with strong preference for cis-9–16:1 over the cis-7-isomer, even though both unsaturated 16:1 fatty acids were present. Some preference for cis-11 over cis-9–18:1 was also seen (18Goldfine H. Panos C. Phospholipids of Clostridium butyricum IV: analysis of the positional isomers of monounsaturated and cyclopropane fatty acids and alk-1′-enyl ethers by capillary column chromatography.J. Lipid Res. 1971; 12 (5554109): 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specificity was also observed for the CFA synthase of E. coli. A series of monounsaturated fatty acids were added to the growth medium of an unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph. As in C. beijerinckii, there was strong specificity for cis-9- and cis-11–16:1 and 18:1 isomers (19Marinari L.A. Goldfine H. Panos C. Specificity of cyclopropane fatty acid synthesis in Escherichia coli: utilization of isomers of monounsaturated fatty acids.Biochemistry. 1974; 13 (4599378): 1978-198310.1021/bi00706a030Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the active site of CFA synthase is positioned to interact with double bonds in phospholipids at a certain distance from the ends of the acyl chains. But what are the functions of CFA? It was known that they are formed in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria at the beginning of the stationary phase and that, with time, a significant proportion of unsaturated fatty acid is converted to CFA. We thought that they might have a protective effect for cells that had reached stationary phase and were forced to survive until conditions became conducive for growth resumption. John Harley, an M.D./Ph.D. student, approached this problem by subjecting an E. coli unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph, fed a series of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and cyclopropane fatty acids, to hyperbaric oxygen. He found that cells grown on a C19 cyclopropane fatty acid (9,10-methyleneoctadecanoate) were more resistant to hyperbaric oxygen killing than cells grown on oleate (cis-18:1), which in turn were more resistant than cells grown on C18 polyunsaturated fatty acids. He further showed that treatment with hyperbaric oxygen did not result in oxidation of cellular monounsaturated fatty acids, leading to the conclusion that CFA provide a barrier rather than resistance to oxidation of the membrane fatty acids (20Harley J.B. Santangelo G.M. Rasmussen H. Goldfine H. Dependence of Escherichia coli hyperbaric oxygen toxicity on the lipid acyl chain composition.J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134 (350850): 808-82010.1128/JB.134.3.808-820.1978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The barrier function of CFA was further emphasized by the sensitivity of cfa mutants to acid shock (21Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. Membrane cyclopropane fatty acid content is a major factor in acid resistance of Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33 (10411742): 249-25910.1046/j.1365-2958.1999.01456.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Recent work with a cfa mutant of Salmonella Typhimurium found that the mutant was more sensitive than the WT to acidic conditions, H2O2, and the protonophore carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone. There was increased sensitivity to oxidative conditions in murine macrophages and attenuation of virulence in a murine model of infection. 3J. E. Karlinsey, A. M. Fung, N. C. Johnston, H. Goldfine, S. J. Libby, and F. C. Fang, unpublished data. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, cyclopropanation of long-chain mycolic acids is important for resistance to oxidative stress and virulence in animals studies (23Barry 3rd, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Mycolic acids: structure, biosynthesis and physiological functions.Prog.

It appears that CFA have evolved to protect bacteria against stresses to help ensure long-term survival and, in the case of pathogenic bacteria, to help circumvent host defenses. From the work of several laboratories in the early 1970s, it became clear that plasmalogen synthesis in animal tissues requires molecular oxygen (24McIntyre T.M. Snyder F. Marathe G.K.

https://openalex.org/W3013654754,"The generation of genetically modified mouse models derived from gene targeting (GT) in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (mESCs) has greatly advanced both basic and clinical research. Our previous finding that gene targeting at the Myh9 exon2 site in mESCs has a pronounced high homologous recombination (HR) efficiency (>90%) has facilitated the generation of a series of nonmuscle myosin II (NM II) related mouse models. Furthermore, the Myh9 gene locus has been well demonstrated to be a new safe harbor for site-specific insertion of other exogenous genes. In the current study, we intend to investigate the molecular biology underlying for this high HR efficiency from other aspects. Our results confirmed some previously characterized properties and revealed some unreported observations: 1) The comparison and analysis of the targeting events occurring at the Myh9 and several widely used loci for targeting transgenesis, including ColA1, HPRT, ROSA26, and the sequences utilized for generating these targeting constructs, indicated that a total length about 6 kb with approximate 50% GC-content of the 5' and 3' homologous arms, may facilitate a better performance in terms of GT efficiency. 2) Despite increasing the length of the homologous arms, shifting the targeting site from the Myh9 exon2, to intron2, or exon3 led to a gradually reduced GT frequency (91.7, 71.8 and 50.0%, respectively). This finding provides the first evidence that the HR frequency may also be associated with the targeting site even in the same locus. Meanwhile, the decreased trend of the GT efficiency at these targeting sites was consistent with the reduced percentage of simple sequence repeat (SSR) and short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) in the sequences for generating the targeting constructs, suggesting the potential effects of these DNA elements on GT efficiency; 3) Our series of targeting experiments and analyses with truncated 5' and 3' arms at the Myh9 exon2 site demonstrated that GT efficiency positively correlates with the total length of the homologous arms (R = 0.7256, p<0.01), confirmed that a 2:1 ratio of the length, a 50% GC-content and the higher amount of SINEs for the 5' and 3' arms may benefit for appreciable GT frequency. Though more investigations are required, the Myh9 gene locus appears to be an ideal location for identifying HR-related cis and trans factors, which in turn provide mechanistic insights and also facilitate the practical application of gene editing."
https://openalex.org/W3013727336,"Depression is common among cardiac patients and associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Bright light therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for depressive symptoms, however it has not yet been investigated in this population. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial to assess the feasibility of a larger-scale trial testing bright light therapy for depressive symptoms in cardiac patients. Patients hospitalized for an acute coronary syndrome or undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized to either bright light (10,000 lux) or dim light placebo (500 lux) lamps for 30 minutes each day over 4 weeks, beginning in-hospital. Depression was quantified using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21). The Short-Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36) was used to measure quality of life. A total of 175 patients were screened and 15 were randomized (8 treatment, 7 placebo) (8.6%) over 10 months. Despite protocol amendments which broadened the inclusion criteria, the trial was terminated early for infeasibility based on the rate of enrollment (1–2 participants/month), with 39.5% of the target sample (38 participants) enrolled. Future trials should take into account the timing of the onset of depressive symptoms in these patients, and consider a less conservative approach to eligibility as well as ways to increase the acceptability of bright light therapy in hospitalized cardiac patients. Once enrolled, our findings suggest that most participants will adhere to the assigned treatment and complete follow-up."
