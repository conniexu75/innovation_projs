To characterize molecular systems associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), we constructed gene-regulatory networks in 1,647 postmortem brain tissues from LOAD patients and nondemented subjects, and we demonstrate that LOAD reconfigures specific portions of the molecular interaction structure. Through an integrative network-based approach, we rank-ordered these network structures for relevance to LOAD pathology, highlighting an immune- and microglia-specific module that is dominated by genes involved in pathogen phagocytosis, contains TYROBP as a key regulator, and is upregulated in LOAD. Mouse microglia cells overexpressing intact or truncated TYROBP revealed expression changes that significantly overlapped the human brain TYROBP network. Thus the causal network structure is a useful predictor of response to gene perturbations and presents a framework to test models of disease mechanisms underlying LOAD.

Complex diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) arise from the downstream interplay of DNA-sequence variants and nongenetic factors that act through molecular networks to confer disease risk (Schadt, 2009Schadt E.E. Molecular networks as sensors and drivers of common human diseases.Nature. 2009; 461: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Despite decades of intensive research, the causal chain of mechanisms behind LOAD remains elusive. In fact, there are no effective disease-modifying or preventive therapies, and the only available treatment remains symptomatic; meanwhile, the incidence of LOAD is expected to double by 2050 (Brookmeyer et al., 2007Brookmeyer R. Johnson E. Ziegler-Graham K. Arrighi H.M. Forecasting the global burden of Alzheimer’s disease.Alzheimers Dement. 2007; 3: 186-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2446) Google Scholar). Progress in LOAD research is fundamentally limited by our reliance on mouse models of severe familial/early-onset Alzheimer’s disease; therefore, our primary knowledge of LOAD is in actuality based on the downstream effects of three rare mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 (Bertram et al., 2010Bertram L. Lill C.M. Tanzi R.E. The genetics of Alzheimer disease: back to the future.Neuron. 2010; 68: 270-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Although such mouse models are necessary and helpful, the cognitive deficits in these transgenic mice are less severe than those in humans, and they do not exhibit equivalent neurodegeneration, which is the most accurate clinical marker of cognitive disease progression in humans. Correspondingly, attrition rates from early discovery to late drug development have been very high (Schäfer and Kolkhof, 2008Schäfer S. Kolkhof P. Failure is an option: learning from unsuccessful proof-of-concept trials.Drug Discov. Today. 2008; 13: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast to the plethora of potential disease mechanisms detected in humans with LOAD, the search for LOAD-modifying interventions has focused primarily on compounds targeting the amyloid-β pathway. Both biological risk factors, often related to vascular health and psychosocial factors (Cechetto et al., 2008Cechetto D.F. Hachinski V. Whitehead S.N. Vascular risk factors and Alzheimer’s disease.Expert Rev. Neurother. 2008; 8: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar; Qiu et al., 2010Qiu C. Xu W. Fratiglioni L. Vascular and psychosocial factors in Alzheimer’s disease: epidemiological evidence toward intervention.J. Alzheimers Dis. 2010; 20: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), as well as genetic susceptibility play a critical role in the underlying pathophysiology of LOAD (Bertram et al., 2010Bertram L. Lill C.M. Tanzi R.E. The genetics of Alzheimer disease: back to the future.Neuron. 2010; 68: 270-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). APOE is still the best validated susceptibility gene accounting for at least 30% of the genetic variance in LOAD (Corder et al., 1993Corder E.H. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Schmechel D.E. Gaskell P.C. Small G.W. Roses A.D. Haines J.L. Pericak-Vance M.A. Gene dose of apolipoprotein E type 4 allele and the risk of Alzheimer’s disease in late onset families.Science. 1993; 261: 921-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (7262) Google Scholar). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several additional genetic risk loci for LOAD that seem to cluster in patterns that suggest immunity (CLU, CR1, CD33, EPHA1, MS4A4A/MS4A6A), lipid processing (APOE, ABCA7), and endocytosis (PICALM, BIN1, CD2AP) as important causal biological processes (Bettens et al., 2013Bettens K. Sleegers K. Van Broeckhoven C. Genetic insights in Alzheimer’s disease.Lancet Neurol. 2013; 12: 92-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). More recently, low-frequency missense variants in APP and TREM2 were found to confer strong protection or elevated risk of LOAD (Guerreiro et al., 2013Guerreiro R. Wojtas A. Bras J. Carrasquillo M. Rogaeva E. Majounie E. Cruchaga C. Sassi C. Kauwe J.S. Younkin S. et al.Alzheimer Genetic Analysis GroupTREM2 variants in Alzheimer’s disease.N. Engl. J.

Med. 2013; 368: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). However, the overall contribution of these new common and low-frequency variants to the heritability of LOAD is very small, suggesting that a large fraction of the genetic variance beyond the APOE risk still remains hidden. Can we clarify the pathology of LOAD by zooming out to the pathway level to search for emergent risk of many genomic contributions? If so, how can we identify the key causal genes in these pathways? In light of the complexity and elusiveness of LOAD pathogenesis, new approaches are needed to boost the probability of identifying causal genes and pathways. Recently, we have leveraged the molecular network structure that is reflected in genotypic and gene-expression data to uncover biologically meaningful gene modules involved in the development of complex disease (Chen et al., 2008Chen Y. Zhu J. Lum P.Y. Yang X. Pinto S. MacNeil D.J. Zhang C. Lamb J. Edwards S. Sieberts S.K. et al.Variations in DNA elucidate molecular networks that cause disease.Nature. 2008; 452: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar; Emilsson et al., 2008Emilsson V. Thorleifsson G. Zhang B. Leonardson A.S. Zink F. Zhu J. Carlson S. Helgason A. Walters G.B. Gunnarsdottir S. et al.Genetics of gene expression and its effect on disease.Nature. 2008; 452: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Targeting such causal networks in ways that restore them to a normal state has been proposed as a path to treat disease (Schadt et al., 2009Schadt E.E. Friend S.H. Shaywitz D.A. A network view of disease and compound screening.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), but this potential has never been realized for LOAD. However, the complexity of these networks makes it difficult to distinguish the causal from correlated disease effects or how the causal regulators propagate their effects. To better address this, we constructed molecular networks based on whole-genome gene-expression profiling and genotyping data in 1,647 autopsied brain tissues from hundreds of LOAD patients and nondemented subjects. We identified numerous modules of distinct functional categories and cellular specificity, many showing a massive remodeling effect in the LOAD brain. Next, we applied an integrative network-based approach to rank-order these modules for relevance to LOAD pathology and used a Bayesian inference to identify the key causal regulators of these remodeled networks. For instance, we identified eight causal regulators of the top-ranked immune/microglia module, including TYROBP (a.k.a. DAP12) as the highest ranking in terms of regulatory strength and differential expression in LOAD brains. We demonstrate through mouse microglia cells overexpressing intact or truncated dominant-negative TYROBP that downstream expression changes significantly overlapped the human TYROBP brain network. This study presents many of the network advantages useful in identifying and prioritizing pathways and gene targets involved in the pathophysiology of LOAD. We developed and applied an integrative network-based approach to identify modules of genes associated with neurodegenerative disease (Figures 1A–1C). We processed 1,647 autopsied tissues from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), visual cortex (VC), and cerebellum (CB) in 549 brains of 376 LOAD patients and 173 nondemented healthy controls (Figure 1A). All subjects were diagnosed at intake, and each brain underwent extensive LOAD-related pathology examination. We note that the known APOE genotype exposure was confirmed in the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center (HBTRC) sample, showing an odds ratio of 3.74 per copy ε4 allele (p = 4.1 × 10−13). Each tissue sample was profiled for 39,579 transcripts representing 25,242 known and 14,337 predicted gene-expression traits, and each subject genotyped for 838,958 unique SNPs (Figure 1A). Unless otherwise noted, gene-expression analyses were adjusted for age and sex, postmortem interval (PMI) in hours, and sample pH and RNA integrity number (RIN). In the overall cohort of LOAD and nondemented brains, the mean ± standard deviation (SD) for sample PMI, pH, and RIN were 17.8 ± 8.3, 6.4 ± 0.3, and 6.8 ± 0.8, respectively. Extensive analysis of the effect of covariates on gene-expression variation in LOAD and nondemented brains was carried out, as shown in Figure S1 (available online) and described in the Extended Experimental Procedures. Here, we used a robust linear regression model for covariate corrections in all our gene-expression analyses (Experimental Procedures). Results of traditional differential expression analysis demonstrate that subsets of genes were up- or downregulated in LOAD (Figure 2A). Consistent with the known progression and regional severity of LOAD pathology (Braak and Braak, 1991Braak H. Braak E. Neuropathological stageing of Alzheimer-related changes.Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we observed that the PFC region contained the greatest number of differentially expressed genes (Figure 2B). Figure 2C summarizes the clustering or colinearity of the various LOAD pathology traits and age within the HBTRC cohort, resulting in distinct groups of clinical pathology and age as separate clusters. For instance, the number of significant correlations of expression traits to neuropathology like Braak stage within the LOAD patient group was highest in the PFC region (Figure 2D). Given these observations and the fact that PFC is more commonly affected in LOAD than CB and VC (Braak and Braak, 1991Braak H. Braak E. Neuropathological stageing of Alzheimer-related changes.Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a particular attention was paid to this region in our strategy to rank-order modules for relevance to LOAD. These massive data sets were the basis of further method development with the aim to identify and rank-order network modules and gene targets associated with LOAD pathology (Figures 1A–1C). Results of these various analysis steps are discussed in the sections that follow, and a more detailed description of methods and statistical procedures is found in the Extended Experimental Procedures.Figure S1Correcting for Covariate Effects on the Expression Data in the Nondemented and LOAD Brains, Related to Figure 1Show full captionEach plot shows the distribution of the correlation p values (x axis) between a specific covariate and all the probes based on the expression data before (red curve, raw) and after the adjustment (black curve, corrected).

See also Table S1. For simultaneously capturing the intra- and interregional gene-gene interactions in the LOAD or nondemented state, we constructed multitissue coexpression networks consisting of the top one-third (n = 13,193) of the most variable gene-expression traits per brain region in individuals donating tissues from all three regions (Extended Experimental Procedures). The multitissue coexpression network in LOAD brains indicated strong structurally segregated regions of the human brain molecular interactome (Figure 3A), consisting of 111 modules and each containing between 30 and 1,446 gene members (Figure 3A), whereas the network generated from nondemented samples has 89 modules ranging in size from 30 to 2,278 genes. Figure 3B highlights a direct comparison of the two topological overlap matrices corresponding to the LOAD or nondemented associated network for a subset of 16 modules, demonstrating that LOAD reconfigures specific portions of the molecular interaction structure. To analytically detect and quantify this network reorganization across the demented and nondemented states, we developed a metric that we refer to as modular differential connectivity (MDC) (Extended Experimental Procedures). MDC is the ratio of the average connectivity for any pair of module-sharing genes in LOAD compared to that of the same genes in the nondemented state and is a continuous measure ranging from 0 to infinity. This module-centric measure of differential connectivity between the two states is therefore fundamentally different from the gene-centric analysis of previous studies that applied hard cutoffs (Mani et al., 2008Mani K.M. Lefebvre C. Wang K. Lim W.K. Basso K. Dalla-Favera R. Califano A. A systems biology approach to prediction of oncogenes and molecular perturbation targets in B-cell lymphomas.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2008; 4: 169Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Given the nature of the coexpression network analysis, MDC > 1 indicates gain of connectivity (GOC) or enhanced coregulation between genes, whereas MDC < 1 indicates loss of connectivity (LOC) or reduced coregulation between genes. In extreme cases where MDC ≫1, e.g., the glutathione transferase (GST) module (Figure 3B), or MDC ≪ 1, e.g., the nerve myelination module (Figure 3B), the corresponding genes do not form a coherent cluster in the nondemented state or LOAD, respectively. Thus, new modules are created in LOAD, whereas in other cases, a portion of the network is completely disrupted. The statistical significance of the MDC metrics was computed through the false discovery rate (FDR) procedure as described in the Extended Experimental Procedures. Based on 10% FDR, 54% of all modules showed GOC, whereas 4.5% of modules exhibited LOC. The structures of the remaining 41.5% of the modules were found to be conserved across the LOAD and nondemented states by this MDC measure. We note a negligible overlap of only 6% between signatures of differential connectivity and standard differential gene expression in LOAD brains, implying that the observed disruption in coregulation of genes reflects a previously untapped marker of LOAD neuropathology. As observed in previous network-based studies (Chen et al., 2008Chen Y. Zhu J. Lum P.Y. Yang X. Pinto S. MacNeil D.J. Zhang C. Lamb J. Edwards S. Sieberts S.K. et al.Variations in DNA elucidate molecular networks that cause disease.Nature. 2008; 452: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar; Emilsson et al., 2008Emilsson V.

A general framework for weighted gene co-expression network analysis.Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2005; 4: e17Google Scholar), we find that brain gene expression is organized into modules of distinct functional categories (Figure 3C). Overrepresentation of canonical pathways and biological processes in modules was measured through Fisher’s exact test (FET) and corrected for number of modules and functional categories tested. Figure 3C highlights significant overrepresentation of functional categories in modules showing GOC, LOC, or conserved connectivity and containing at least 50 genes. The multifactorial basis of LOAD neuropathology involves biological processes active in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the metabolic and vascular peripheral system that have often progressed silently for many years (Huang and Mucke, 2012Huang Y. Mucke L. Alzheimer mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.Cell. 2012; 148: 1204-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar; Murray et al., 2011Murray I.V. Proza J.F. Sohrabji F. Lawler J.M. Vascular and metabolic dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease: a review.Exp. Biol. Med. (Maywood). 2011; 236: 772-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In fact, we find that multiple functional categories, including the immune response, unfolded protein, vascular system, extracellular matrix, neurogenesis (brain development), glucose homeostasis, synaptic transmission, and olfactory sensory perception categories in the GOC modules, are highly enriched in the LOAD-associated modules (Figure 3C), whereas the LOC modules are enriched for genes involved in nerve myelination, cell cycle, γ-aminobutyricacid (GABA) metabolism, and neurotrophin signaling (Figure 3C). Many of these functional categories have previously been implicated in LOAD and/or CNS-related function (Ansari and Scheff, 2010Ansari M.A. Scheff S.W.

Aging. 2002; 23: 397-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), again reinforcing the complex multifactorial basis of the underlying pathophysiology. The functional categories enriched in the conserved modules included “muscle contraction” (actin-related system), coated vesicle, cadherin, and zinc ion metabolism (Figure 3C). CNS cell-type-specific gene signatures, from the Allen Brain Atlas (http://www.brain-map.org/), were enriched in distinct network modules as previously observed (Oldham et al., 2008Oldham M.C. Konopka G. Iwamoto K. Langfelder P. Kato T. Horvath S. Geschwind D.H. Functional organization of the transcriptome in human brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1271-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar): neurons in the synaptic transmission modules (11-fold, p = 3.7 × 10−24), astrocytes in the GABA biosynthesis module (22 fold, p = 1.5 × 10−15), oligodendrocytes in the nerve myelination module (30 fold, p = 2.5 × 10−30), choroid plexus cell types in the extracellular matrix module (35 fold, p = 3.9 × 10−15), and microglia signatures responding to amyloid-β treatment (Walker et al., 2006Walker D.G. Link J. Lue L.F. Dalsing-Hernandez J.E. Boyes B.E. Gene expression changes by amyloid beta peptide-stimulated human postmortem brain microglia identify activation of multiple inflammatory processes.J. Leukoc. Biol. 2006; 79: 596-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) in the immune module (10-fold, p = 4.5 × 10−20) (Figure 3C). In contrast to the GOC and LOC modules, conserved modules were not enriched for any CNS-specific cell types (Figure 3C). Pathways enriched in the brain modules and not previously implicated in LOAD may therefore represent novel disease mechanisms including, for instance, the glucuronosyl transferase activity and the dynein complex (Figure 3C). Moreover, the comprehensive representation of gene-gene interactions in the LOAD-associated networks can uncover novel gene members in pathways already implicated in LOAD, thus allowing us to work out a known pathologic mechanism in more detail than ever before. In summary, the immune module shows the statistically most significant functional enrichment of all modules (Figure 3C) and as such may have a more comprehensive representation of its respective pathway members. Table S1 contains extensive information regarding the functional enrichment and gene membership of modules containing at least 50 unique gene symbols. We highlight some specific findings of interest from Figure 3C: (1) The enrichment of pathways related to olfactory sensory perception in a LOAD-associated module is of interest given that the processing of olfactory function is affected in subjects who are genetically at risk of developing LOAD long before the symptoms of dementia are manifested (Schiffman et al., 2002Schiffman S.S. Graham B.G. Sattely-Miller E.A. Zervakis J. Welsh-Bohmer K. Taste, smell and neuropsychological performance of individuals at familial risk for Alzheimer’s disease.Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 397-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). (2) The APOE transcript is located in the LOC module enriched for astrocyte signatures and GABA metabolism, consistent with the observation that astrocytes are the major source of APOE in the CNS (Boyles et al., 1985Boyles J.K. Pitas R.E. Wilson E. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Apolipoprotein E associated with astrocytic glia of the central nervous system and with nonmyelinating glia of the peripheral nervous system.J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 1501-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The close connectivity of APOE and GABA metabolism in the brain network may therefore have some bearing on the observation that GABA interneuron dysfunction is particularly severe in APOE4 carriers (Li et al., 2009Li G.F. Bien-Ly N. Andrews-Zwilling Y. Xu Q. Bernardo A. Ring K. Halabisky B. Deng C. Mahley R.W. Huang Y.

(3) The previously identified macrophage-enriched metabolic network (MEMN) in peripheral tissues and strongly supported as causal for a number of metabolic and vascular traits related to obesity, diabetes, and heart disease (Chen et al., 2008Chen Y. Zhu J. Lum P.Y. Yang X. Pinto S. MacNeil D.J. Zhang C. Lamb J. Edwards S.

This is of interest given the strong epidemiological evidence for metabolic- and vascular-based exposure on LOAD (Huang and Mucke, 2012Huang Y. Mucke L.

https://openalex.org/W2074471441,"Protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) leads to cell death through PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α, although the mechanism is not understood. ChIP-seq and mRNA-seq of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), key transcription factors downstream of p-eIF2α, demonstrated that they interact to directly induce genes encoding protein synthesis and the unfolded protein response, but not apoptosis. Forced expression of ATF4 and CHOP increased protein synthesis and caused ATP depletion, oxidative stress and cell death. The increased protein synthesis and oxidative stress were necessary signals for cell death. We show that eIF2α-phosphorylation-attenuated protein synthesis, and not Atf4 mRNA translation, promotes cell survival. These results show that transcriptional induction through ATF4 and CHOP increases protein synthesis leading to oxidative stress and cell death. The findings suggest that limiting protein synthesis will be therapeutic for diseases caused by protein misfolding in the ER."

We sequenced the genomes of 57 prostate tumors and matched normal tissues to characterize somatic alterations and to study how they accumulate during oncogenesis and progression. By modeling the genesis of genomic rearrangements, we identified abundant DNA translocations and deletions that arise in a highly interdependent manner. This phenomenon, which we term ""chromoplexy,"" frequently accounts for the dysregulation of prostate cancer genes and appears to disrupt multiple cancer genes coordinately. Our modeling suggests that chromoplexy may induce considerable genomic derangement over relatively few events in prostate cancer and other neoplasms, supporting a model of punctuated cancer evolution. By characterizing the clonal hierarchy of genomic lesions in prostate tumors, we charted a path of oncogenic events along which chromoplexy may drive prostate carcinogenesis."

We have previously shown that the CD33 gene is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we observed increased expression of CD33 in microglial cells in AD brain. The minor allele of the CD33 SNP rs3865444, which confers protection against AD, was associated with reductions in both CD33 expression and insoluble amyloid beta 42 (Aβ42) levels in AD brain. Furthermore, the numbers of CD33-immunoreactive microglia were positively correlated with insoluble Aβ42 levels and plaque burden in AD brain. CD33 inhibited uptake and clearance of Aβ42 in microglial cell cultures. Finally, brain levels of insoluble Aβ42 as well as amyloid plaque burden were markedly reduced in APP(Swe)/PS1(ΔE9)/CD33(-/-) mice. Therefore, CD33 inactivation mitigates Aβ pathology and CD33 inhibition could represent a novel therapy for AD."

https://openalex.org/W2059276463,"The adult CNS contains an abundant population of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (NG2(+) cells) that generate oligodendrocytes and repair myelin, but how these ubiquitous progenitors maintain their density is unknown. We generated NG2-mEGFP mice and used in vivo two-photon imaging to study their dynamics in the adult brain. Time-lapse imaging revealed that NG2(+) cells in the cortex were highly dynamic; they surveyed their local environment with motile filopodia, extended growth cones and continuously migrated. They maintained unique territories though self-avoidance, and NG2(+) cell loss though death, differentiation or ablation triggered rapid migration and proliferation of adjacent cells to restore their density. NG2(+) cells recruited to sites of focal CNS injury were similarly replaced by a proliferative burst surrounding the injury site. Thus, homeostatic control of NG2(+) cell density through a balance of active growth and self-repulsion ensures that these progenitors are available to replace oligodendrocytes and participate in tissue repair."
https://openalex.org/W2127604631,"DNA mismatch repair (MMR) ensures replication fidelity by correcting mismatches generated during DNA replication. Although human MMR has been reconstituted in vitro, how MMR occurs in vivo is unknown. Here, we show that an epigenetic histone mark, H3K36me3, is required in vivo to recruit the mismatch recognition protein hMutSα (hMSH2-hMSH6) onto chromatin through direct interactions with the hMSH6 PWWP domain. The abundance of H3K36me3 in G1 and early S phases ensures that hMutSα is enriched on chromatin before mispairs are introduced during DNA replication. Cells lacking the H3K36 trimethyltransferase SETD2 display microsatellite instability (MSI) and an elevated spontaneous mutation frequency, characteristic of MMR-deficient cells. This work reveals that a histone mark regulates MMR in human cells and explains the long-standing puzzle of MSI-positive cancer cells that lack detectable mutations in known MMR genes."

Furthermore, the findings suggest VDR ligands as a potential therapy for liver fibrosis. Hepatic fibrosis, defined by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and resultant loss of pliability and liver function, is the result of wound-healing responses triggered by either acute or chronic liver injury (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R.

With persistent injury, there is progressive deposition of fibrillar collagens, eventually leading to parenchymal nodules surrounded by collagen bands, the histological signature of hepatic cirrhosis (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar; Friedman, 2003Friedman S.L. Liver fibrosis — from bench to bedside.J. Hepatol. 2003; 38: S38-S53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis represent a major global health concern (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar). In Australia and the United Kingdom, chronic liver disease is the fifth most common cause of death, after heart disease, cancer, stroke, and chest disease (Williams, 2006Williams R. Global challenges in liver disease.Hepatology. 2006; 44: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In the United States, they are ranked as the eighth most common cause of mortality (Kim et al., 2002Kim W.R. Brown Jr., R.S. Terrault N.A. El-Serag H. Burden of liver disease in the United States: summary of a workshop.Hepatology. 2002; 36: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Currently, no antifibrotic therapies for chronic liver disease have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (Cohen-Naftaly and Friedman, 2011Cohen-Naftaly M. Friedman S.L. Current status of novel antifibrotic therapies in patients with chronic liver disease.Therap. Adv. Gastroenterol. 2011; 4: 391-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and where the underlying cause of the liver disease cannot be ameliorated, therapeutic options are limited to addressing the consequent complications, such as portal hypertension, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. Therefore, a greater understanding of molecular mechanisms regulating the hepatic fibrogenic response in liver is needed for the identification of novel targets for successful antifibrotic therapies. The central players in liver fibrosis are nonparenchymal cells such as hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (4142) Google Scholar; Bouwens et al., 1992Bouwens L. De Bleser P. Vanderkerken K. Geerts B. Wisse E.

Hepatic stellate cells: role in microcirculation and pathophysiology of portal hypertension.Gut. 2002; 50: 571-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In the healthy liver, HSCs are retinoid (vitamin A) storage cells located in the space of Disse, between the sinusoidal endothelium and hepatocytes (Friedman, 2008Friedman S.L. Hepatic stellate cells: protean, multifunctional, and enigmatic cells of the liver.Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 125-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2074) Google Scholar). Following injury, paracrine stimuli cause HSCs to undergo dramatic phenotypic changes (in a process called activation), whereby they exhibit proliferation, contractility, and loss of retinoid stores, accompanied by secretion of chemokines, cytokines, and pathological ECM components (Friedman, 2008Friedman S.L.

History, heterogeneity, developmental biology, and functions of quiescent hepatic stellate cells.Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 311-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). While the precise mechanisms regulating this process have yet to be elucidated, transforming growth factor (TGF) β1 signaling is recognized as one of the most potent profibrotic pathways responsible for ECM synthesis (Breitkopf et al., 2006Breitkopf K. Godoy P. Ciuclan L. Singer M.V. Dooley S. TGF-beta/Smad signaling in the injured liver.Z. Gastroenterol. 2006; 44: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar; Inagaki and Okazaki, 2007Inagaki Y. Okazaki I. Emerging insights into Transforming growth factor beta Smad signal in hepatic fibrogenesis.Gut. 2007; 56: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). TGFβ is a multifunctional cytokine with profound effects on cell division, differentiation, migration, adhesion, organization, and death. There are three major isoforms of TGFβ (TGFβ1, TGFβ2, and TGFβ3), and TGFβ1 is the principal isoform implicated in liver fibrosis (Inagaki and Okazaki, 2007Inagaki Y. Okazaki I. Emerging insights into Transforming growth factor beta Smad signal in hepatic fibrogenesis.Gut. 2007; 56: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Following liver injury, TGFβ1, derived from both paracrine and autocrine sources, binds to type I and type II serine/threonine receptor kinases on the cell surface of HSCs (Inagaki and Okazaki, 2007Inagaki Y. Okazaki I. Emerging insights into Transforming growth factor beta Smad signal in hepatic fibrogenesis.Gut. 2007; 56: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Subsequently, its downstream effectors SMAD2 and SMAD3 are phosphorylated and released into the cytosol, where they form a complex with SMAD4. This SMAD complex can then translocate into the nucleus, recognize SMAD-binding elements (SBE) on the genome, and directly regulate target genes (Feng and Derynck, 2005Feng X.H. Derynck R. Specificity and versatility in tgf-beta signaling through Smads.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 659-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar; Massagué et al., 2005Massagué J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Smad transcription factors.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). Thus, deciphering the TGFβ/SMAD transcriptional network in HSCs and understanding how it can be controlled by extracellular and intracellular factors are key to the development of effective antifibrotic strategies. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) superfamily and is a key regulator of calcium homeostasis and skeletal health (Bouillon et al., 2008Bouillon R. Carmeliet G. Verlinden L. van Etten E. Verstuyf A. Luderer H.F. Lieben L. Mathieu C. Demay M. Vitamin D and human health: lessons from vitamin D receptor null mice.Endocr.

Effects of calcium and of the Vitamin D system on skeletal and calcium homeostasis: lessons from genetic models.J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 89-90: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The endogenous activators of this receptor are the biologically active form of vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) and bile acids such as lithocholic acid (LCA) and its derivatives (LCA-acetate, LCA-formate, 3-keto LCA) (Makishima et al., 2002Makishima M. Lu T.T. Xie W. Whitfield G.K. Domoto H. Evans R.M. Haussler M.R. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Noncalcemic actions of vitamin D receptor ligands.Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 662-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the closest structural and functional relatives of VDR within the NHR superfamily include farnesoid X receptor (FXR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and pregnane X receptor (PXR), all of which are regulators of bile acid homeostasis and xenobiotic detoxification in the liver (Bookout et al., 2006Bookout A.L. Jeong Y. Downes M. Yu R.T. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Anatomical profiling of nuclear receptor expression reveals a hierarchical transcriptional network.Cell. 2006; 126: 789-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar; Bouillon et al., 2008Bouillon R.

Rev. 2008; 29: 726-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). However, a physiological role for vitamin D in hepatic function has long been dismissed due to low levels of VDR expression in liver (Bookout et al., 2006Bookout A.L. Jeong Y. Downes M. Yu R.T. Evans R.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Anatomical profiling of nuclear receptor expression reveals a hierarchical transcriptional network.Cell. 2006; 126: 789-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar; Han et al., 2010Han S. Li T. Ellis E. Strom S. Chiang J.Y. A novel bile acid-activated vitamin D receptor signaling in human hepatocytes.Mol. Endocrinol. 2010; 24: 1151-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the finding of robust VDR expression in HSCs led us to consider it as a possible modulator of liver fibrosis (Gascon-Barré et al., 2003Gascon-Barré M. Demers C. Mirshahi A. Néron S. Zalzal S. Nanci A. The normal liver harbors the vitamin D nuclear receptor in nonparenchymal and biliary epithelial cells.Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1034-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that liver fibrosis in a standard mouse model of hepatic injury can be ameliorated by administration of the synthetic VDR agonist calcipotriol, which reduces both collagen deposition and fibrotic gene expression. We also show that Vdr knockout mice develop spontaneous liver fibrosis, proving a role for this receptor in normal liver homeostasis. Mechanistic studies revealed that activation of VDR signaling antagonizes a wide range of TGFβ/SMAD-dependent transcriptional responses on profibrotic genes in HSCs. Mapping of genome-wide binding sites of VDR and SMAD3 revealed overlapping DNA occupancy of these transcription factors on cis-regulatory elements of profibrotic genes. Interestingly, TGFβ/SMAD signaling enhanced the accessibility of liganded VDR with these genomic loci, which in turn antagonized recruitment of SMAD3. This dynamic VDR/SMAD genomic feedback circuit represents a previously unrecognized mechanism for regulating hepatic fibrogenesis. Consistent with previous results (Abramovitch et al., 2011Abramovitch S. Dahan-Bachar L. Sharvit E. Weisman Y. Ben Tov A. Brazowski E. Reif S. Vitamin D inhibits proliferation and profibrotic marker expression in hepatic stellate cells and decreases thioacetamide-induced liver fibrosis in rats.Gut. 2011; 60: 1728-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar; Gascon-Barré et al., 2003Gascon-Barré M.

The normal liver harbors the vitamin D nuclear receptor in nonparenchymal and biliary epithelial cells.Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1034-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), we found that Vdr is expressed in HSCs but is not detectable in either whole liver or purified hepatocytes (Figures S1A–S1C available online). Moreover, the HSC-expressed VDR is fully functional as determined by ligand induction of CYP24A1 expression by either 1,25(OH)2D3 or its low-calcemic analog, calcipotriol (Cal) (Nagpal et al., 2005Nagpal S.

Error bars represent SEM. To address whether VDR signaling could suppress fibrotic gene expression and counteract hepatic fibrogenesis in vivo, liver fibrosis was induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), a widely used hepatotoxic agent, at a dose of 0.5 ml/kg administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection three times per week in wild-type C57BL/6J mice. By 4 weeks, CCl4-treated mice exhibited extensive liver bridging fibrosis with substantial collagen deposition, whereas CCl4/calcipotriol-cotreated mice had a significant reduction in fibrosis as demonstrated by quantitation of Sirius red staining, hepatic hydroxyproline content, and histological fibrotic scoring (Figures 1A–1D). The serum calcium concentration was not significantly altered by calcipotriol treatment (Figure S2B). Examination of key fibrotic marker genes such as Col1a1, Tgfb1, and Timp1 revealed between 50% and 70% downregulation by calcipotriol (Figures 1E–1G). Interestingly, when the mice were pretreated with calcipotriol for 5 weeks prior to CCl4/calcipotriol-cotreatment, the fibrogenic response in liver was nearly completely abrogated (Figures S2C–S2F), suggesting that the VDR agonist possesses not only the ability to attenuate fibrosis but also the potential to proactively prevent liver fibrosis in vivo. This led us to examine whether VDR deficiency could impact liver fibrogenesis. Indeed, 6-month-old Vdr−/− mice exhibited a spontaneous liver injury/fibrosis phenotype as demonstrated by increased collagen deposition, with two of four mice developing frank cirrhosis (Figure 1H, right/top) associated with hepatocyte necrosis and foci of necroinflammation surrounding portal tracts (Figure 1H, right/bottom, arrow). As there was some variability in the degree of liver fibrosis observed using Sirius red staining of liver sections, liver hydroxyproline content was measured in the two Vdr−/− mice exhibiting the least fibrosis (noncirrhotic mice) and was still found to be significantly greater than that observed in either wild-type or Vdr+/− mice (Figure 1I). Moreover, Vdr+/− mice exhibited multiple foci of perisinusoidal fibrosis in the absence of an inflammatory response (Figure 1H, center/top, arrows), a pathology not observed in control wild-type mice maintained on an identical calcium- and phosphate-supplemented diet (Figure 1H, left). Histological findings were confirmed by quantitation of hepatic hydroxyproline content as well as examination of key fibrotic marker gene, Col1a1 (Figures 1I and 1J). These data suggest that both Vdr alleles are required for the maintenance of normal liver architecture and that when completely abrogated, the result is loss of control of the local inflammatory response in addition to dysregulation of fibrogenesis. Expression profiling was used to explore the potential impact of VDR signaling in TGFβ1 and TGFβ1 plus 1,25(OH)2D3-treated primary rat HSCs. Notably, 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment attenuated the culture-induced activation of HSCs, such that the transcriptome of treated cells closely resembled that of freshly isolated quiescent cells (Figure 2A) and cotreatment of 1,25(OH)2D3 together with TGFβ1 resulted in considerable repression of a large set of TGFβ1 induced genes (Table S1). Among these, we noted 39 genes central to hepatic fibrogenesis, including collagens (Bataller and Brenner, 2005Bataller R. Brenner D.A. Liver fibrosis.J. Clin.

Next, we confirmed that calcipotriol potently repressed fibrotic gene expression in both primary mouse HSCs and LX-2 cells, suggesting that the anti-TGFβ properties of VDR agonists are likely conserved across mammalian species (data not shown and Figure 2C). Finally, using RNA interference (RNAi) in LX-2 cells, we found that loss of VDR abolished calcipotriol-mediated repression of TGFβ1-induced gene expression (Figure 2C), collectively revealing that VDR regulates an anti-TGFβ/fibrotic network in vitro. A major question raised by these observations was whether VDR was a direct or indirect regulator of the antifibrotic gene network. As SMAD2 and SMAD3 are required for TGFβ1-induced profibrotic gene expression in HSCs (Figure S3A) and VDR activation did not significantly affect TGFβ1-induced phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of SMAD3 (Figure S3B), we proposed a direct regulatory role for VDR. To explore this possibility, we analyzed the genome-wide binding sites of VDR and SMAD3 in LX-2 cells cultured with both calcipotriol and TGFβ1 using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). The resulting cistromes identified 24,984 VDR and 23,581 SMAD3 high-confidence binding sites (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.0001) (Figures 3A and 3E ). Consistent with the reported global binding pattern for other transcription factors (Barish et al., 2010Barish G.D. Yu R.T. Karunasiri M. Ocampo C.B. Dixon J. Benner C. Dent A.L. Tangirala R.K.

From the list of VDR- and SMAD3-binding sites, we confirmed a number of previously characterized functional vitamin D response elements (VDRE) for known vitamin-D-inducible genes, such as CYP24A1 (Figure 3B), SPP1, and BGLAP (Figures S4A and S4B), and SBE for TGFβ signaling target genes, including ID1 (Figure 3F), SMAD7, and TGFβI (Figures S4C and S4D). Gene annotation analysis assigned peaks based on the proximity to the closest transcription start site and yielded 11,031 and 9,210 putative target genes within the individual VDR and SMAD3 cistromes, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2093570808,"The existence of a haematopoietic stem cell niche as a spatially confined regulatory entity relies on the notion that haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are strategically positioned in unique bone marrow microenvironments with defined anatomical and functional features. Here, we employ a powerful imaging cytometry platform to perform a comprehensive quantitative analysis of HSPC distribution in bone marrow cavities of femoral bones. We find that HSPCs preferentially localize in endosteal zones, where most closely interact with sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal bone marrow microvessels, which form a distinctive circulatory system. In situ tissue analysis reveals that HSPCs exhibit a hypoxic profile, defined by strong retention of pimonidazole and expression of HIF- 1α, regardless of localization throughout the bone marrow, adjacency to vascular structures or cell-cycle status. These studies argue that the characteristic hypoxic state of HSPCs is not solely the result of a minimally oxygenated niche but may be partially regulated by cell-specific mechanisms. Haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are found in unique bone marrow microenvironments. Silberstein and colleagues use imaging cytometry to quantitatively determine HSPC distribution in femoral bones. They find that HSPCs are in endosteal zones, in close proximity to specialized microvessels, and that they appear in a hypoxic state whether or not they are close to the vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W2067775919,"Translation inhibition is a major but poorly understood mode of action of microRNAs (miRNAs) in plants and animals. In particular, the subcellular location where this process takes place is unknown. Here, we show that the translation inhibition, but not the mRNA cleavage activity, of Arabidopsis miRNAs requires ALTERED MERISTEM PROGRAM1 (AMP1). AMP1 encodes an integral membrane protein associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ARGONAUTE1, the miRNA effector and a peripheral ER membrane protein. Large differences in polysome association of miRNA target RNAs are found between wild-type and the amp1 mutant for membrane-bound, but not total, polysomes. This, together with AMP1-independent recruitment of miRNA target transcripts to membrane fractions, shows that miRNAs inhibit the translation of target RNAs on the ER. This study demonstrates that translation inhibition is an important activity of plant miRNAs, reveals the subcellular location of this activity, and uncovers a previously unknown function of the ER."

They characterize the population structure of this parasite in Cambodia and find evidence for multiple distinct subpopulations showing high levels of genetic differentiation and artemisinin resistance. We describe an analysis of genome variation in 825 P. falciparum samples from Asia and Africa that identifies an unusual pattern of parasite population structure at the epicenter of artemisinin resistance in western Cambodia. Within this relatively small geographic area, we have discovered several distinct but apparently sympatric parasite subpopulations with extremely high levels of genetic differentiation. Of particular interest are three subpopulations, all associated with clinical resistance to artemisinin, which have skewed allele frequency spectra and high levels of haplotype homozygosity, indicative of founder effects and recent population expansion. We provide a catalog of SNPs that show high levels of differentiation in the artemisinin-resistant subpopulations, including codon variants in transporter proteins and DNA mismatch repair proteins. These data provide a population-level genetic framework for investigating the biological origins of artemisinin resistance and for defining molecular markers to assist in its elimination."
https://openalex.org/W2015299616,"Naoki Irie and colleagues report the draft genomes of the soft-shell and green sea turtles. Their genome-wide phylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis that turtles are a sister group of crocodilians and birds. The unique anatomical features of turtles have raised unanswered questions about the origin of their unique body plan. We generated and analyzed draft genomes of the soft-shell turtle (Pelodiscus sinensis) and the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas); our results indicated the close relationship of the turtles to the bird-crocodilian lineage, from which they split ∼267.9–248.3 million years ago (Upper Permian to Triassic). We also found extensive expansion of olfactory receptor genes in these turtles. Embryonic gene expression analysis identified an hourglass-like divergence of turtle and chicken embryogenesis, with maximal conservation around the vertebrate phylotypic period, rather than at later stages that show the amniote-common pattern. Wnt5a expression was found in the growth zone of the dorsal shell, supporting the possible co-option of limb-associated Wnt signaling in the acquisition of this turtle-specific novelty. Our results suggest that turtle evolution was accompanied by an unexpectedly conservative vertebrate phylotypic period, followed by turtle-specific repatterning of development to yield the novel structure of the shell."
https://openalex.org/W2133693612,"By using high-throughput sequencing of T-cell receptors, this study shows that thymus-derived regulatory T (Treg) cells constitute most Treg cells in all lymphoid and intestinal organs, including the colon, suggesting that thymic Treg cells and not induced Treg cells dominantly control tolerance to the gut’s antigens such as commensal microbiota. The identity of the intestinal regulatory T (Treg) cells that control autoimmune diseases such as colitis and immune responses to commensal microbes remains ill defined. In this study Anna Cebula et al. use high-throughput sequencing of T-cell receptors to show that the predominant Treg cells in all lymphoid and intestinal organs, including the colon, are derived from the thymus. This challenges the view that induced rather than thymic Treg cells are mainly responsible for the control of intestinal inflammation, although it does not exclude the possibility that induced Treg cells contribute to intestinal homeostasis. Peripheral mechanisms preventing autoimmunity and maintaining tolerance to commensal microbiota involve CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells1,2 generated in the thymus or extrathymically by induction of naive CD4+Foxp3− T cells. Previous studies suggested that the T-cell receptor repertoires of thymic Treg cells and induced Treg cells are biased towards self and non-self antigens, respectively3,4,5,6, but their relative contribution in controlling immunopathology, such as colitis and other untoward inflammatory responses triggered by different types of antigens, remains unresolved7. The intestine, and especially the colon, is a particularly suitable organ to study this question, given the variety of self-, microbiota- and food-derived antigens to which Treg cells and other T-cell populations are exposed. Intestinal environments can enhance conversion to a regulatory lineage8,9 and favour tolerogenic presentation of antigens to naive CD4+ T cells10,11, suggesting that intestinal homeostasis depends on microbiota-specific induced Treg cells12,13,14,15. Here, to identify the origin and antigen-specificity of intestinal Treg cells, we performed single-cell and high-throughput sequencing of the T-cell receptor repertoires of CD4+Foxp3+ and CD4+Foxp3− T cells, and analysed their reactivity against specific commensal species. We show that thymus-derived Treg cells constitute most Treg cells in all lymphoid and intestinal organs, including the colon, where their repertoire is heavily influenced by the composition of the microbiota. Our results suggest that thymic Treg cells, and not induced Treg cells, dominantly mediate tolerance to antigens produced by intestinal commensals."
https://openalex.org/W2157227019,"The ability of signalling proteins to traverse tissues containing tightly packed cells is of fundamental importance for cell specification and tissue development; however, how this is achieved at a cellular level remains poorly understood. For more than a century, the vertebrate limb bud has served as a model for studying cell signalling during embryonic development. Here we optimize single-cell real-time imaging to delineate the cellular mechanisms for how signalling proteins, such as sonic hedgehog (SHH), that possess membrane-bound covalent lipid modifications traverse long distances within the vertebrate limb bud in vivo. By directly imaging SHH ligand production under native regulatory control in chick (Gallus gallus) embryos, our findings show that SHH is unexpectedly produced in the form of a particle that remains associated with the cell via long cytoplasmic extensions that span several cell diameters. We show that these cellular extensions are a specialized class of actin-based filopodia with novel cytoskeletal features that have not been previously described. Notably, particles containing SHH travel along these extensions with a net anterograde movement within the field of SHH cell signalling. We further show that in SHH-responding cells, specific subsets of SHH co-receptors, including cell adhesion molecule downregulated by oncogenes (CDO) and brother of CDO (BOC), actively distribute and co-localize in specific micro-domains within filopodial extensions, far from the cell body. Stabilized interactions are formed between filopodia containing SHH ligand and those containing co-receptors over a long range. These results suggest that contact-mediated release propagated by specialized filopodia contributes to the delivery of SHH at a distance. Together, these studies identify an important mode of communication between cells that considerably extends our understanding of ligand movement and reception during vertebrate tissue patterning."
https://openalex.org/W2030933765,"Long-term exposure to glucocorticoids following chronic stress is detrimental to cognitive processes including learning and memory. Even so, short term glucocorticoid surges can facilitate cognition. Here the authors show that the circadian oscillation in circulating glucocorticoids is important for motor skill learning–induced dendritic spine remodeling. They also show that circadian glucocorticoid-mediated synaptic modification acts through non-transcriptional mechanism involving cytoskeleton remodeling and correlates with long-term memory retention. Excessive glucocorticoid exposure during chronic stress causes synapse loss and learning impairment. Under normal physiological conditions, glucocorticoid activity oscillates in synchrony with the circadian rhythm. Whether and how endogenous glucocorticoid oscillations modulate synaptic plasticity and learning is unknown. Here we show that circadian glucocorticoid peaks promote postsynaptic dendritic spine formation in the mouse cortex after motor skill learning, whereas troughs are required for stabilizing newly formed spines that are important for long-term memory retention. Conversely, chronic and excessive exposure to glucocorticoids eliminates learning-associated new spines and disrupts previously acquired memories. Furthermore, we show that glucocorticoids promote rapid spine formation through a non-transcriptional mechanism by means of the LIM kinase–cofilin pathway and increase spine elimination through transcriptional mechanisms involving mineralocorticoid receptor activation. Together, these findings indicate that tightly regulated circadian glucocorticoid oscillations are important for learning-dependent synaptic formation and maintenance. They also delineate a new signaling mechanism underlying these effects."
https://openalex.org/W2001416012,"Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) are involved in RNA editing that converts adenosine residues to inosine specifically in double-stranded RNAs. In this study, we investigated the interaction of the RNA editing mechanism with the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery and found that ADAR1 forms a complex with Dicer through direct protein-protein interaction. Most importantly, ADAR1 increases the maximum rate (Vmax) of pre-microRNA (miRNA) cleavage by Dicer and facilitates loading of miRNA onto RNA-induced silencing complexes, identifying a new role of ADAR1 in miRNA processing and RNAi mechanisms. ADAR1 differentiates its functions in RNA editing and RNAi by the formation of either ADAR1/ADAR1 homodimer or Dicer/ADAR1 heterodimer complexes, respectively.

The translation machinery reads inosine as guanosine, leading to the recoding of a relatively small number of neurotransmitter and ion channel genes and diversification of their functions (Hood and Emeson, 2012Hood J.L. Emeson R.B. Editing of neurotransmitter receptor and ion channel RNAs in the nervous system.Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2012; 353: 61-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, A-to-I editing occurs most frequently in noncoding regions that contain repetitive elements such as Alu and LINE (Ramaswami et al., 2012Ramaswami G. Lin W. Piskol R. Tan M.H. Davis C. Li J.B. Accurate identification of human Alu and non-Alu RNA editing sites.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 579-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The biological significance of repetitive RNA editing is largely unknown. Three ADAR gene family members (ADAR1–3) are known in vertebrates. Members of the ADAR gene family share common structural features, such as the presence of multiple dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) and a separate deaminase domain. Three repeats of dsRBD are present in ADAR1, whereas only two repeats are found in ADAR2 and ADAR3 (Nishikura, 2010Nishikura K. Functions and regulation of RNA editing by ADAR deaminases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The inactivation of ADAR1 leads to an embryonic lethal phenotype due to widespread apoptosis (Hartner et al., 2004Hartner J.C. Schmittwolf C. Kispert A. Müller A.M. Higuchi M. Seeburg P.H. Liver disintegration in the mouse embryo caused by deficiency in the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1.J. Biol.

Stress-induced apoptosis associated with null mutation of ADAR1 RNA editing deaminase gene.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4952-4961Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), indicating the absolute requirement of ADAR1 for life. However, the mechanism that underlies the ADAR1−/− mouse phenotype is unknown. The RNase III gene family members Drosha and Dicer are key components of the microRNA (miRNA) processing machinery (Krol et al., 2010Krol J. Loedige I. Filipowicz W. The widespread regulation of microRNA biogenesis, function and decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, Drosha with a dsRNA-binding protein DGCR8 cleaves primary transcripts of miRNA genes (pri-miRNAs) to produce intermediate precursors, pre-miRNAs. Once exported to the cytoplasm, pre-miRNAs are cleaved by Dicer, releasing 21–24 nt mature miRNAs (Krol et al., 2010Krol J. Loedige I. Filipowicz W. The widespread regulation of microRNA biogenesis, function and decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). A separate dsRNA-binding protein, HIV-1 TAR RNA-binding protein (TRBP), binds to Dicer and enhances the Dicer activity (Chakravarthy et al., 2010Chakravarthy S. Sternberg S.H. Kellenberger C.A. Doudna J.A. Substrate-specific kinetics of Dicer-catalyzed RNA processing.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 404: 392-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The Dicer/TRBP complex also acts as the platform for RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) assembly by recruiting Ago2 (Chendrimada et al., 2005Chendrimada T.P. Gregory R.I. Kumaraswamy E. Norman J. Cooch N. Nishikura K. Shiekhattar R. TRBP recruits the Dicer complex to Ago2 for microRNA processing and gene silencing.Nature. 2005; 436: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar), which is the catalytic engine to execute the RISC-mediated silencing either by translational suppression or degradation of target mRNAs (Liu et al., 2004Liu J.

The RISC consisting of Dicer, TRBP, and Ago2 is the core miRNA-mediated silencing machinery that couples the miRNA processing and silencing steps (Gregory et al., 2005Gregory R.I. Chendrimada T.P.

RNA interference (RNAi)-dependent endogenous short RNAs (endo-siRNA) derived from loci enriched for inverted repeats and transposons are dramatically upregulated in ADAR null mutant worms, indicating that A-to-I RNA editing of dsRNA regions of transcripts derived from these loci inhibits their entry into the RNAi silencing pathway (Wu et al., 2011Wu D. Lamm A.T. Fire A.Z. Competition between ADAR and RNAi pathways for an extensive class of RNA targets.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The A-to-I RNA editing mechanism appears to compete for shared dsRNA substrates with the RNAi machinery and inhibit synthesis of endo-siRNAs (Wu et al., 2011Wu D. Lamm A.T. Fire A.Z. Competition between ADAR and RNAi pathways for an extensive class of RNA targets.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, certain pri-miRNAs are subject to A-to-I RNA editing. Editing of pri-miRNAs could inhibit their processing (Kawahara et al., 2007aKawahara Y. Zinshteyn B. Chendrimada T.P. Shiekhattar R.

Chem. 2010; 285: 33358-33370Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), or lead to silencing of a different set of target genes by the edited miRNAs (Kawahara et al., 2007bKawahara Y. Zinshteyn B.

Redirection of silencing targets by adenosine-to-inosine editing of miRNAs.Science. 2007; 315: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). With these recent studies implicating an antagonistic interaction of A-to-I RNA editing and RNAi pathways, we investigated the interaction of ADAR1 with the RISC component proteins. We found that ADAR1 interacts directly with Dicer in an RNA-binding-independent manner and promotes processing of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and miRNA, RISC loading of miRNAs, and consequently silencing of target RNAs, revealing a stimulative, instead of antagonistic, role of ADAR1 in RNAi. In contrast to the requirement of homodimerization for the A-to-I RNA editing activities of ADAR1 (Cho et al., 2003Cho D.S. Yang W. Lee J.T. Shiekhattar R. Murray J.M. Nishikura K. Requirement of dimerization for RNA editing activity of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17093-17102Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), one monomer of ADAR1 binds to one molecule of Dicer. ADAR1 thus acts as an RNA editing enzyme or as a modulator of the RNAi machinery by choosing its complex partner (i.e., ADAR1 itself or Dicer). Two isoforms of ADAR1, a full-length interferon-inducible ADAR1p150 and a shorter and constitutive ADAR1p110 truncated at the N terminus, are known. A recent study indicates that both ADAR1p150 and ADAR1p110 shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fritz et al., 2009Fritz J. Strehblow A. Taschner A. Schopoff S. Pasierbek P. Jantsch M.F. RNA-regulated interaction of transportin-1 and exportin-5 with the double-stranded RNA-binding domain regulates nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of ADAR1.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1487-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We confirmed that both ADAR1p150 and p110 are located in the cytoplasm and nucleus of human cell lines (Figure S1A available online). ADAR2, known to localize mainly in the nucleus (Nishikura, 2010Nishikura K. Functions and regulation of RNA editing by ADAR deaminases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2010; 79: 321-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), and Dicer, known to localize in the cytoplasm (Krol et al., 2010Krol J. Loedige I. Filipowicz W. The widespread regulation of microRNA biogenesis, function and decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar), served as controls for the quality of extraction (Figure S1A). A-to-I editing is considered to take place mainly in the nucleus, and thus, the cytoplasmic distribution of ADAR1 suggests that it may have functions separate from RNA editing, possibly in the RNAi mechanism (Nishikura, 2006Nishikura K. Editor meets silencer: crosstalk between RNA editing and RNA interference.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 919-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We investigated the interaction of the cytoplasmic ADAR1 with RISC component proteins. The FLAG-epitope-tagged RISC proteins F-Dicer, F-TRBP, and F-Ago2 were all individually purified from permanently transformed HEK293 cell lines (Figure S1B). As expected, endogenous RISC partner proteins were detected in F-Dicer, F-TRBP, or F-Ago2 immunoprecipitation (IP) products (Figure 1A, left three columns). Most significantly, we found that each FLAG-tagged RISC member also pulled down endogenous ADAR1p110 (Figure 1A). ADAR1p150 showed lesser interaction, probably due to its low expression in HEK293 cells (Figure S1A). The reciprocal F-ADAR1p110 IP experiment pulled down endogenous Dicer as well as TRBP and Ago2 to a lesser extent (Figure 1A, F-ADAR1p110 column). As a negative control, all FLAG IP products were checked for interaction with endogenous Tudor-SN, a protein reported to promote cleavage of hyperedited inosine containing dsRNAs (Scadden, 2005Scadden A.D. The RISC subunit Tudor-SN binds to hyper-edited double-stranded RNA and promotes its cleavage.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We found no interaction with Tudor-SN, confirming that the interaction observed between ADAR1 and RISC proteins was specific (Figure 1A, bottom). Mock FLAG-IP experiments done with untransfected HEK293 cells indicated that none of the endogenous Dicer, TRBP, Ago2, or ADAR1 contaminated the mock purification products (Figure 1A, Mock column), confirming that the endogenous ADAR1 was specifically pulled down with RISC member proteins. Similar F-ADAR2 IP experiments revealed no interaction of ADAR2 with RISC proteins (data not shown). Size exclusion chromatography of F-Dicer IP products revealed complexes of ∼450 kDa size consisting of endogenous ADAR1p110 proteins (Figure 1B). The expected size of a complex consisting of Dicer, ADAR1p110, and Ago2 is ∼450 kDa. Although the above experiments showed strong interaction of ADAR1 with Dicer, they also showed lesser interaction with the other RISC components. We therefore used a recombinant baculovirus coinfection/copurification system to more precisely characterize the interactions of ADAR1. A histidine affinity tag (HAT)-tagged ADAR1 (H-ADAR1) expression virus was coinfected in Sf9 cells with an F-Dicer, F-Ago2, or untagged TRBP expression virus, and the resulting complexes were purified by FLAG IP or His-based TALON affinity chromatography. Each type of affinity purification is completely specific for its cognate epitope tag, as demonstrated by mock purification control experiments (Figure S1C). We examined both ADAR1p110 and ADAR1p150 as well as a mutant ADAR1p150-EAA, which is devoid of dsRNA binding due to point mutations (KKxxK→EAxxA) introduced in each of the three dsRBDs (Valente and Nishikura, 2007Valente L. Nishikura K. RNA binding-independent dimerization of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA and dominant negative effects of nonfunctional subunits on dimer functions.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16054-16061Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Copurification of F-Dicer revealed its interaction with all three forms of ADAR1, including the ADAR1p150-EAA RNA-binding-defective mutant (Figure 1C, left). The results established an RNA-binding-independent interaction of ADAR1 with Dicer. In contrast, the amount of TRBP associated with H-ADAR1p110 or H-ADAR1p150 was substantially lower and was virtually absent for H-ADAR1p150-EAA (Figure 1C, center). Finally, attempted copurification of F-Ago2 and H-ADAR1 from coinfected Sf9 cells failed, indicating that they do not interact directly with each other (Figure 1C, right). These results demonstrate that the association of ADAR1 with TRBP and Ago2 is indirect (i.e., bridged by Dicer and/or dsRNA). We then purified ADAR1-associated complexes from Sf9 cells triple infected with F-Dicer, H-ADAR1, and human influenza hemagglutinin-tagged Ago2 (HA-Ago2) expression viruses first by TALON column and then by hemagglutinin IP. The FLAG IP procedure was not used for purification of these complexes. Nevertheless, the purified complex contained not only H-ADAR1 and HA-Ago2 but also F-Dicer (Figure 1D), indicating that ADAR1 does form a triple complex with Dicer and also with Ago2 through its interaction with Dicer. Finally, we examined whether the interaction of ADAR1 with Dicer would preclude the interaction of TRBP with Dicer or vice versa by analyzing FLAG-IP products copurified from Sf9 cells triple infected with a 1:1:1 ratio of F-Dicer, H-ADAR1, and untagged TRBP expression baculoviruses. ADAR1, including the ADAR1p150-EAA RNA-binding-defective mutant, and TRBP were copurified with Dicer (Figure 1E). Because ADAR1 does not interact with TRBP (Figure 1C, center), ADAR1 and TRBP detected here in the F-Dicer pull-down products most likely represent proteins present in two separate Dicer complexes: one Dicer/ADAR1 and the other Dicer/TRBP. The results suggest that the presence (coexpression) of ADAR1 did not exclude formation of Dicer/TRBP complexes and the presence (coexpression) of TRBP did not exclude formation of Dicer/ADAR1 complexes. FLAG-Dicer pull-down of TRBP conducted in the absence of ADAR1 (Figure 1F, coinfection) indicates that perhaps slightly more (but not significantly more) TRBP proteins can be complexed with Dicer if ADAR1 is not coexpressed as compared to TRBP proteins pulled down in the presence of ADAR1 (Figure 1E, triple infection). These results suggest that there is no extreme affinity difference between ADAR1 and TRBP for binding to Dicer. We examined the domains of ADAR1 and Dicer that are involved in their protein-protein interaction. ADAR1p150 contains two Z-DNA binding domains (α and β), three dsRBDs (dsRBD1, dsRBD2, and dsRBD3), and a C-terminal deaminase domain. The N terminus region containing the Z-DNA binding domain α is missing in ADAR1p110 (Figure 2A). Dicer contains a DEAD-box RNA helicase domain at the N terminus region followed by DUF283 and PAZ domains, two catalytic RNase III domains, and a dsRNA binding domain at the C terminus (Figure 2A). The PAZ domain of Dicer likely binds to the 2 nt 3′ overhangs of miRNAs and siRNAs (Krol et al., 2010Krol J. Loedige I. Filipowicz W. The widespread regulation of microRNA biogenesis, function and decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 597-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar), whereas the DEAD-box RNA helicase domain may be involved in an autoinhibition mechanism (Ma et al., 2008Ma E. MacRae I.J. Kirsch J.F. Doudna J.A. Autoinhibition of human dicer by its internal helicase domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Both ADAR1p150 and ADAR1p110 interacted with Dicer (Figure 1C), so ADAR1p110 was used for domain mapping analysis. C-terminal deletion constructs of H-ADAR1p110 and C-terminal deletion and N-terminal deletion constructs of F-Dicer were prepared (Figure 2A). These ADAR1 and Dicer deletion constructs were coinfected with the full-length partner construct in Sf9 cells. The FLAG-IP purification is in general cleaner than that of TALON purification. Therefore, we used the FLAG-IP procedure both for identification of H-ADAR1 deletion mutants interacting with F-Dicer (Figure 2B) and also for identification of F-Dicer deletion mutants interacting with H-ADAR1 (Figure 2C). The full-length F-Dicer (bait) was purified efficiently (Figure 2B, right top), and the full-length H-ADAR1, H-ADAR1Δ1, and H-ADAR1Δ2 mutants, but not the H-ADAR1Δ3 and H-ADAR1Δ4 mutants (prey), were pulled down by F-Dicer (Figure 2B, right bottom), indicating that the second dsRBD (dsRBD2) of ADAR1 is involved in the interaction with Dicer. All F-Dicer mutants (baits) were purified efficiently via FLAG-IP (Figure 2C, right bottom). Whereas the full-length H-ADAR1 was copurified and thus interacted robustly with the full-length F-Dicer and with the F-DicerΔ1, F-DicerΔ2, and F-DicerΔ4 mutants, the F-DicerΔ3 mutant lacking the DUF283 domain and F-DicerΔN1 lacking a part of the DEAD-box RNA helicase domain displayed substantially reduced (<4-fold) interaction with the H-ADAR1p110 (prey) (Figure 2C, right top). Finally, the F-DicerΔN2 mutant lacking both DUF283 and DEAD-box RNA helicase domains lost its interaction with ADAR1 completely (Figure 2C, right top), indicating that both domains are involved in the interaction with ADAR1. We also determined the ADAR1 domains involved in the ADAR1 homodimer interaction by using the full-length F-ADAR1p110 (bait) and H-ADAR1p110 deletion mutants (prey), which revealed that the third dsRBD (dsRBD3) is required for the interaction (Figure 2D, right bottom). Together, our results indicate that ADAR1 uses dsRBD2 and dsRBD3 differentially for formation of the Dicer/ADAR1 heterodimer and the ADAR1 homodimer complexes, respectively. Although Dicer alone can cleave pre-miRNA to mature miRNA (pre-miRNA dicing reaction), its catalytic activity is known to be modulated by TRBP and PACT (Chendrimada et al., 2005Chendrimada T.P. Gregory R.I. Kumaraswamy E. Norman J. Cooch N. Nishikura K. Shiekhattar R.

Zhang H. Lainé S. Sack R. Gatignol A. Filipowicz W.

For instance, TRBP binds to Dicer and increases the maximum rate (Vmax) of the pre-miRNA dicing reaction (Chakravarthy et al., 2010Chakravarthy S. Sternberg S.H. Kellenberger C.A. Doudna J.A. Substrate-specific kinetics of Dicer-catalyzed RNA processing.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 404: 392-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we investigated the effect of the ADAR1 interaction with Dicer on the miRNA processing mechanism. We coexpressed F-Dicer with H-ADAR1p110 or H-ADAR1p150 in Sf9 cells, and the F-Dicer/H-ADAR1 complex was purified by consecutive TALON and FLAG affinity chromatography (Figure S2A), which resulted in isolation of the Dicer/ADAR1 complex from free F-Dicer or H-ADAR1 forms (Figure S2B). We also prepared F-Dicer alone and the F-Dicer/H-TRBP complex (Figure S2C). Dicer alone, Dicer/TRBP, and Dicer/ADAR1 complexes were subjected to in vitro Dicer cleavage assay using pre-let7a as substrate (Figure S3A). We also examined a 35 bp completely complementary dsRNA containing 2 nt 3′ overhangs as a different type of Dicer substrate, which can be processed into ∼22 bp siRNAs and used as an siRNA precursor (pre-siRNA) (Figure S4A). We found that the Dicer complexed with ADAR1p150 or ADAR1p110 did cleave both pre-let-7a and pre-siRNA into mature let-7a (Figure 3A) and siRNA (Figure 3B). Furthermore, cleavage of pre-let-7a and pre-siRNA was substantially increased (2- and 4-fold) by both ADAR1p150 and ADAR1p110. This ADAR1 stimulation of Dicer cleavage activities was equivalent to that of TRBP (Figures 3A and 3B). In order to understand how ADAR1 augments the Dicer cleavage, we prepared Dicer/ADAR1 complexes consisting of either ADAR1p110-EAA or ADAR1p110-E912A mutant. As already mentioned, ADAR1p110-EAA cannot bind any (long and short) dsRNA (Valente and Nishikura, 2007Valente L. Nishikura K. RNA binding-independent dimerization of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA and dominant negative effects of nonfunctional subunits on dimer functions.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 16054-16061Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). ADAR1p110-E912A has no deaminase activity because of a point mutation of Glu912 to Ala (Lai et al., 1995Lai F. Drakas R. Nishikura K. Mutagenic analysis of double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase, a candidate enzyme for RNA editing of glutamate-gated ion channel transcripts.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17098-17105Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The glutamate residue is involved in the proton transfer function of the enzyme. The Dicer/ADAR1-E912A complex, just as the Dicer/ADAR1-WT complex, diced pre-let-7a (3-fold) and also pre-siRNA (6-fold) more efficiently as compared to the Dicer-alone control (Figures 3C and 3D), indicating that the ADAR1 catalytic activity is not required for augmentation of the Dicer cleavage reaction. To our surprise, however, we found that the complex consisting of ADAR1-EAA mutant also increased Dicer cleavage of pre-let-7a and pre-siRNA (Figures 3C and 3D). The result indicates that promotion of the Dicer cleavage reaction by ADAR1 is not mediated via direct ADAR1 binding to the substrate RNAs (pre-miRNA or pre-siRNA) but more likely results from conformational changes induced in Dicer by ADAR1.Figure S3Multiple Turnover Dicer Cleavage Assay with Pre-let-7a, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) 5′ 32P-labeled human pre-let-7a and Dicer cleavage reaction products are schematically presented.(B) The time course analysis of Dicer cleavage.

https://openalex.org/W2067401415,"Whisking and sniffing are predominant aspects of exploratory behaviour in rodents. Yet the neural mechanisms that generate and coordinate these and other orofacial motor patterns remain largely uncharacterized. Here we use anatomical, behavioural, electrophysiological and pharmacological tools to show that whisking and sniffing are coordinated by respiratory centres in the ventral medulla. We delineate a distinct region in the ventral medulla that provides rhythmic input to the facial motor neurons that drive protraction of the vibrissae. Neuronal output from this region is reset at each inspiration by direct input from the pre-Bötzinger complex, such that high-frequency sniffing has a one-to-one relationship with whisking, whereas basal respiration is accompanied by intervening whisks that occur between breaths. We conjecture that the respiratory nuclei, which project to other premotor regions for oral and facial control, function as a master clock for behaviours that coordinate with breathing."
https://openalex.org/W1987346828,"DNA origami has shown that principles of molecular recognition can be used to reshape biomolecules into nonphysiological forms. The design and synthesis of a continuous, 12-helix polypeptide that spontaneously self-assembles into a defined tetrahedron now demonstrates that protein structures can be similarly manipulated. Protein structures evolved through a complex interplay of cooperative interactions, and it is still very challenging to design new protein folds de novo. Here we present a strategy to design self-assembling polypeptide nanostructured polyhedra based on modularization using orthogonal dimerizing segments. We designed and experimentally demonstrated the formation of the tetrahedron that self-assembles from a single polypeptide chain comprising 12 concatenated coiled coil–forming segments separated by flexible peptide hinges. The path of the polypeptide chain is guided by a defined order of segments that traverse each of the six edges of the tetrahedron exactly twice, forming coiled-coil dimers with their corresponding partners. The coincidence of the polypeptide termini in the same vertex is demonstrated by reconstituting a split fluorescent protein in the polypeptide with the correct tetrahedral topology. Polypeptides with a deleted or scrambled segment order fail to self-assemble correctly. This design platform provides a foundation for constructing new topological polypeptide folds based on the set of orthogonal interacting polypeptide segments."

Bacterial chromosomes are intriguing subjects for study. They are apparently “simpler” than their eukaryotic counterparts but nonetheless carry out all of the basic processes required for successful transmission of heredity, i.e., DNA replication and chromosome segregation in coordination with cell division. The present study investigates E. coli chromosomes from this perspective, focusing on the organization, organizational dynamics, and the dynamics of sister-chromosome segregation. In eukaryotic organisms, sister segregation is usually discussed in terms of ropes and pulleys operating on compact, discrete objects: sister DNAs are organized initially into chromatin fibers and then into higher-order coherent shapes, all the while kept together by specific cohesin molecules. Sisters then segregate into well-separated spaces by the combined effects of progressive cohesin release and pulling forces generated by the mitotic spindle. Bacterial chromosomes, in contrast, spatially segregate sister chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell in the apparent absence of such apparatus. We have been interested to understand more about how this process might occur, in part because underlying principles might turn out to also be relevant to eukaryotic chromosomes. For bacterial sister segregation, two general issues are important. First, the process of placing sisters in distinct spaces cannot be conceptually separated from the physical nature and organization of the nucleoid. At one extreme, it has been proposed that the nucleoidal fiber can be treated as a randomly oriented polymer, with sister fibers separated by the effects of entropic forces as they operate in the elongated space defined by the cylindrical cell periphery (Jun and Mulder, 2006Jun S. Mulder B. Entropy-driven spatial organization of highly confined polymers: lessons for the bacterial chromosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 12388-12393Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). At the opposite extreme, sister nucleoid domains might comprise coherent, noninteracting entities that separate by mechanically pushing one another apart in space, with concomitant release of constraining intersister tethers (Bates and Kleckner, 2005Bates D. Kleckner N. Chromosome and replisome dynamics in E. coli: Loss of sister cohesion triggers global chromosome movement and mediates chromosome segregation.Cell. 2005; 121: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar; Joshi et al., 2011Joshi M.C.

Escherichia coli sister chromosome separation includes an abrupt global transition with concomitant release of late-splitting intersister snaps.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 2765-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Another model, where sister nucleoids are pumped outward in opposite directions from a “replication factory” (Lemon and Grossman, 2001Lemon K.P. Grossman A.D. The extrusion-capture model for chromosome partitioning in bacteria.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2031-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar; but see Bates, 2008Bates D. The bacterial replisome: back on track?.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), similarly necessitates an intrinsic tendency for nonintermingling of sister fibers. Yet, other models invoke centromere-like sequences that move via molecular motors along railroad tracks or are passively attached to the cell periphery on either side of midcell, with segregation driven by incorporation of cell-wall material at that site (Toro et al., 2008Toro E. Hong S.H. McAdams H.H. Shapiro L. Caulobacter requires a dedicated mechanism to initiate chromosome segregation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 15435-15440Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar; Toro and Shapiro, 2010Toro E. Shapiro L. Bacterial chromosome organization and segregation.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect.

Hypothesis: chromosome separation in Escherichia coli involves autocatalytic gene expression, transertion and membrane-domain formation.Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These latter models ignore the physical state of the nucleoid which, however, is probably highly relevant. The second critical underlying issue for segregation of sisters is physical movement of nucleoid material which, in turn, requires energy. Where does this energy come from? Are thermal forces that are operating on a passive polymer fiber sufficient? Do molecular events place chromosomes in a high-energy, mechanically stressed conformation, which then drives ensuing segregation? Are ATP-driven processes directly involved in segregation and, if so, at which stages, by what mechanism, and in what type of interplay with intrinsic physical features and effects? To further address these questions, we developed and applied a new experimental system for analysis of E. coli chromosome dynamics, at high resolution in time and in three-dimensional (3D) space. Previous studies of nucleoid organization and structure have been limited by technical constraints. Analysis of fixed cells or isolated nucleoids has been informative but cannot detect dynamic behaviors. Also, the possibility of artifacts is always a concern. Analysis of living cells avoids fixation artifacts. However, light microscope imaging permits rapid image acquisition but provides very low spatial resolution while, oppositely, superresolution methods give high spatial resolution but require data collection over timescales that preclude definition of rapid dynamic changes. The current studies were carried out in living cells with a system that combines high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution (Figure 1; Experimental Procedures; Extended Experimental Procedures, available online). Nucleoids were visualized using the general nucleoid-associated protein HU, fluorescently tagged via its HupA subunit (HupA-mCherry) and imaged by wide-field epi-fluorescence microscopy. Imaging provides spatial resolution of less than 260 nm in the XY dimension and less than 470 nm in the Z dimension. An entire nucleoid can be imaged in 3D by a series of Z stacks (Figure 1B) in as few as 2 s. Successive 3D images of a single nucleoid can be taken as frequently as once every 5 s. Concomitantly, the boundaries of the cell periphery are accurately defined for the midcell plane from phase-contrast images (Figure 1A, bottom). For maximum spatiotemporal resolution, cells were imaged while growing in microfluidic channels, wherein they are immobilized by gentle “hugging” in the Z dimension (Figures 1A, top, and S1A–S1D). Growth medium still flows continuously around the immobilized cells. These cells progress through the cell cycle with the same kinetics as occur in exponential phase growing under the same conditions in a standard liquid culture. Importantly, this analysis utilized a strain background and growth conditions where events of the chromosome cycle have previously been analyzed in detail by other methods (CM735; Bates and Kleckner, 2005Bates D.

USA. 2011; 108: 2765-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, cells grow in an ∼120 min “linear” cell cycle. Cell division is followed by a ∼10 min “G1” period. DNA replication is then initiated. Replication lasts ∼60 min. An additional ∼50 min then elapses prior to the next cell division. A final key aspect of this study is that oriC dynamics were analyzed by FROS, in parallel with whole-nucleoid dynamics. Separation of sister oriCs from one another is an easily discerned event that occurs after initiation of replication, at a specific time in the cycle (Figure S1G) (Bates and Kleckner, 2005Bates D. Kleckner N. Chromosome and replisome dynamics in E. coli: Loss of sister cohesion triggers global chromosome movement and mediates chromosome segregation.Cell. 2005; 121: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This event provides a fixed point of reference for defining the timing of events in any particular nucleoid and for temporal alignment of different independent nucleoids. Features of interest were confirmed in another strain background, with another fluorescent nucleoid-associated protein, and/or in cells imaged outside of channels and in the absence of flow, as detailed below. 3D imaging reveals that G1 nucleoids are well-defined ellipsoids that exhibit a variety of helix-like forms (e.g., Figures 1C and 1D and Movie S1; hereafter referred to as “helical” for simplicity). This shape is clearly defined after one round of deconvolution, which eliminates out-of-focus information without introducing artificial sharpening or enhancement, but it is also visible in raw images (Figure S1E). The longitudinal paths of G1 nucleoids can be evaluated by slicing each 3D data set into a series of cross-sections perpendicular to the long axis of the nucleoid and computationally defining the density centroids of these slices. The paths of these centroids exhibit left- and/or right-handed helicity even along the length of a single nucleoid (Figure 1D). Thus, the important feature of nucleoid shape is the tendency for curvature, not any particular handedness.

All images from 1 × deconvolved data. Comparison of fluorescence nucleoid images and phase-contrast midplane images (e.g., Figure 1H, ivory and green, respectively) further reveals that, at early G1 (left panel) the nucleoid is closely juxtaposed to the cell periphery in the radial dimension along its entire length but is well separated from the old pole end of the cell, as previously inferred from fixed cell studies (Bates and Kleckner, 2005Bates D. Kleckner N. Chromosome and replisome dynamics in E. coli: Loss of sister cohesion triggers global chromosome movement and mediates chromosome segregation.Cell. 2005; 121: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Separation from the old pole end of the cell can be even more pronounced at later stages (further examples below; Figures S2A and S2C). This same disposition has been observed in cells grown on agarose pads and imaged with FIS-GFP (Figure S2F). The same two features are also apparent in 3D STORM images of mEos2-labeled HU, which provide higher spatial resolution, but lower temporal resolution, than those of the current study (Wang et al., 2011Wang W. Li G.W. Chen C. Xie X.S. Zhuang X. Chromosome organization by a nucleoid-associated protein in live bacteria.Science. 2011; 333: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Thus, the nucleoid does not simply fill up the interior cell space; rather, it is a discrete, internally delimited object. The space at the end of the cell, while certainly containing proteins and small molecules, is nonetheless fully accessible to the nucleoid, rather than being solidly occluded by ribosomes or other nonvisualized cellular components, because (1) the nucleoid does extend to the ends of the cell at some stages, as shown below by analysis of post-G1 nucleoids; (2) plasmid DNAs localize beyond the nucleoid at the ends of the cell (Kuhlman and Cox, 2012Kuhlman T.E. Cox E.C. Gene location and DNA density determine transcription factor distributions in Escherichia coli.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2012; 8: 610Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); and (3) at some stages, individually tagged chromosomal loci explore the space beyond the end of the nucleoid (J.K.F. and A.B., unpublished data). Since we can specifically define the limits of the nucleoid, we can further define additional features. First, all detectable HupA-mCherry intensity is involved in the shape (Extended Experimental Procedures). Second, nucleoid DNA density is very low: the atoms of the DNA duplex take up only ∼2% of total cell volume while the nucleoid shape comprised of this DNA occupies ∼75% of the total space (see Extended Experimental Procedures). G1 nucleoid shape is highly dynamic. Significant global changes are apparent over intervals as short as 5 s (e.g., Figure 1E and Movie S2). Furthermore, when total nucleoid density is summed in the Z dimension (Figure 1F, left), shape changes are seen to result from waves of density that flux longitudinally, up and down the shape, over distances comparable to the length of the nucleoid, with apparent periodicities of seconds-to-minute(s) (Figure 1F, right). These “longitudinal density waves” are fluxing through the nucleoid in 3D to generate shape changes. Relatively modest changes in nucleoid density distribution are involved. Between images taken 5 s apart, ∼5%–10% of total intensity shifts position (Figure 1G, i–iii) with shifts of ∼15% over longer intervals (Figure 1G, iv). Longitudinal density fluxes are a general, robust feature of nucleoid dynamics. Such fluxes have been observed in each of approximately twenty 5 s time series of G1 or G1/S transition nucleoids and each of ∼100 time series of nucleoids at other cell-cycle stages. Six G1 nucleoids and six G1/S nucleoids, each imaged over periods of ∼40 s, exhibit average density shifts per 5 s interval of 7.2% and 6.6%, respectively. Furthermore, in G1 nucleoids of cells expressing both HupA-mCherry and FIS-GFP, both signals exhibit the same density waves (Figure S3A), which thus represent changes in underlying nucleoid density, not fluxes of HU or FIS protein alone, irrespective of the nucleoid. Density waves are also seen in cells growing on agarose pads without flowing medium and thus are not due to confinement in microfluidic channels nor to fluid flow past tethered or confined cells. Finally, density fluxes are not observed in fixed cells (Figures S3C–S3K) and thus are not artifacts of imaging or image processing. These findings reveal the existence of short-timescale chromosomal motion. This motion occurs prior to onset of DNA replication (and after completion of replication, as shown for analysis of post-G1 nucleoids below) and thus is replication independent. Previous studies show that G1 nucleoids also undergo coherent, longer timescale, globally directional motions. During and immediately following cell division, nucleoids are closely juxtaposed to the evolving new poles at midcell (Bates and Kleckner, 2005Bates D. Kleckner N. Chromosome and replisome dynamics in E. coli: Loss of sister cohesion triggers global chromosome movement and mediates chromosome segregation.Cell. 2005; 121: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), with asymmetric shapes that are fatter at the new pole end (e.g., Figure 1H, left). This configuration probably reflects molecular linkages between the pole and the terminus (ter) macrodomain (Espéli et al., 2012Espéli O. Borne R. Dupaigne P. Thiel A. Gigant E. Mercier R. Boccard F. A MatP-divisome interaction coordinates chromosome segregation with cell division in E. coli.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3198-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). As septum formation is completed, sisters move away from the emerging poles, without major internal reorganization but with concomitant elongation (Bates and Kleckner, 2005Bates D. Kleckner N. Chromosome and replisome dynamics in E. coli: Loss of sister cohesion triggers global chromosome movement and mediates chromosome segregation.Cell. 2005; 121: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar; Figure 1H, right). Time-lapse further reveals that elongation concomitantly yields a more regular shape with a more even density distribution (e.g., Figure 1H, compare left versus right). Longitudinal density fluxes presumably underlie these movements. However, these fluxes must in some way be directionally biased so as to give the observed effects (Discussion). Additionally, the G1 nucleoid retains its close contact with the cell periphery throughout dynamic shape and length changes (e.g., Figure 1H). When cross-sectional slices perpendicular to the length of the nucleoid (Figure 2A, i) are displayed in an intensity-coded array (Figure 2A, ii), density substructure is revealed. Some slices exhibit a nearly symmetrical “bulls-eye” pattern; however, many exhibit two structures of high central intensity, one stacked above the other. The same features characterize fully individualized sister nucleoids immediately prior to cell division (pre-G1). Doubleness is seen in nondeconvolved images and thus is not a deconvolution artifact (Figure S1I). The dual-density centroid(s) of cross-sectional slices run continuously along the length of the nucleoid (Figure 2A, iii). We thus describe the revealed subshapes as longitudinal density bundles. In accordance with the fact that they underlie an ellipsoid shape, bundles are wider in the middle of the nucleoid than at the ends. In accordance with the helical shape of the ellipsoid, dual-bundle paths tend to be relationally twisted (Figure 2A, ii and iii). And since the entire nucleoid is involved in the helical ellipsoid shape and its component density bundles, the nucleoid does not comprise a central scaffold surrounded by disordered material. Further, in accordance with dynamic nucleoid shape changes, bundle patterns change in intensity and position as density waves flux through the nucleoid (Figure 2B). These dynamics probably reflect local changes in interfiber proximity rather than global movement of a fixed proteinaceous core (Discussion). Intriguingly, G1 nucleoids are single genomes; no sister is present. Moreover, while the E. coli chromosome is a single circular DNA molecule, ∼95% of the genome is linearly organized along the cell length, with a thin, elongated strand completing the circle (Figure 2C) (Wang et al., 2006Wang X. Liu X. Possoz C. Sherratt D.J. The two Escherichia coli chromosome arms locate to separate cell halves.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1727-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar; Wiggins et al., 2010Wiggins P.A. Cheveralls K.C. Martin J.S. Lintner R. Kondev J. Strong intranucleoid interactions organize the Escherichia coli chromosome into a nucleoid filament.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 4991-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This organization was defined in AB1157, which, we show, also exhibits dual longitudinal bundles at G1 (Figure S1F). Thus, dual bundles do not reflect the “left” and “right” sides of the circular chromosome but instead imply the existence of an intrinsic tendency for duality (or more generally, “splitting”) due to some biochemical and/or physical feature of the system. The nucleoid is in close contact with the cell periphery. We further find that a change in the radius of the cell confers both a matching change in the helical radius of the nucleoid plus an inverse change in nucleoid helical pitch (Figure 2D) in three types of studies. (1) The standard strain for this study exhibits spontaneous variation between two cell types, longer/thinner and shorter/fatter, whose nucleoids respectively exhibit smaller radius with greater pitch and larger radius with smaller pitch (Figure 2E). (2) Inhibition of cell-wall synthesis causes rounding-up of midcell regions where, locally, the nucleoid exhibits increased radius and decreased pitch (Figure 2F). (3) Enzymatic cell-wall removal, carried out in the absence of DNA-condensing agents converts the cell to a spherical shape and, concomitantly, the nucleoid becomes a very large radius, low-pitch ellipsoidal crescent, still juxtaposed against the edge of the cell (Figure 2G). These observations imply that helicity of the nucleoid shape is not determined internally (e.g., by the longitudinal density bundles described above); instead, the helical aspect is determined by interaction of the basic ellipsoid form with the radial cell periphery. Further, since cells become spheroplasts by cell-wall removal in only a few minutes, such interaction is required not only to establish helical dimensions but to maintain those dimensions. Strikingly, the observed correlations are precisely those predicted if the nucleoid is a longitudinally stiff ellipsoid that has been forced into a helical path within a too-small cylinder (i.e., a cylinder whose radius is smaller than the persistence length of the ellipsoid). If the nucleoid could be forced into a radially confined helical shape as it evolves, the resulting state could then be maintained by outward-directed pushing forces along the nucleoid length. The observed effects might be explained, alternatively, if the nucleoid were a soft ellipsoid that was linked to the inner cell periphery specifically along a peripheral helical path (red dots in Figure 2D). We do not favor this model because (1) the nucleoid does not exhibit a tightly defined external helical-peripheral path that would encourage such association; (2) the nucleoid is of relatively low density around its entire outer surface, implying that molecular contacts between the nucleoid and cell periphery strong enough to change the shape of the nucleoid would probably rip the nucleoid apart; and (3) contrary to early reports, there is no c"
https://openalex.org/W2014117157,"Evolution of the mammalian brain encompassed a remarkable increase in size of the cerebral cortex, which includes tangential and radial expansion. However, the mechanisms underlying these key features are still largely unknown. Here, we identified the DNA-associated protein Trnp1 as a regulator of cerebral cortex expansion in both of these dimensions. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in the mouse cerebral cortex in vivo demonstrate that high Trnp1 levels promote neural stem cell self-renewal and tangential expansion. In contrast, lower levels promote radial expansion, with a potent increase of the number of intermediate progenitors and basal radial glial cells leading to folding of the otherwise smooth murine cerebral cortex. Remarkably, TRNP1 expression levels exhibit regional differences in the cerebral cortex of human fetuses, anticipating radial or tangential expansion. Thus, the dynamic regulation of Trnp1 is critical to control tangential and radial expansion of the cerebral cortex in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1966556364,"Many species are critically dependent on olfaction for survival. In the main olfactory system of mammals, odours are detected by sensory neurons that express a large repertoire of canonical odorant receptors and a much smaller repertoire of trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). Odours are encoded in a combinatorial fashion across glomeruli in the main olfactory bulb, with each glomerulus corresponding to a specific receptor. The degree to which individual receptor genes contribute to odour perception is unclear. Here we show that genetic deletion of the olfactory Taar gene family, or even a single Taar gene (Taar4), eliminates the aversion that mice display to low concentrations of volatile amines and to the odour of predator urine. Our findings identify a role for the TAARs in olfaction, namely, in the high-sensitivity detection of innately aversive odours. In addition, our data reveal that aversive amines are represented in a non-redundant fashion, and that individual main olfactory receptor genes can contribute substantially to odour perception."
https://openalex.org/W2164166968,"The role of intracellular transcriptional/post-translational feedback loops (TTFL) within the circadian pacemaker of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is well established.

We therefore combined viral transduction of SCN slices with fluorescence/bioluminescence imaging to visualize GCaMP3-reported circadian oscillations of intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i alongside activation of Ca2+ /cAMP-responsive elements. We phase-mapped them to the TTFL, in time and SCN space, and demonstrated their dependence upon G-coupled vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) signaling. Pharmacogenetic manipulation revealed the individual contributions of Gq, Gs, and Gi to cytosolic and TTFL circadian rhythms. Importantly, activation of Gq-dependent (but not Gs or Gi) pathways in a minority of neurons reprogrammed [Ca2+]i and TTFL rhythms across the entire SCN. This reprogramming was mediated by intrinsic VIPergic signaling, thus revealing a Gq/[Ca2+]i-VIP leitmotif and unanticipated plasticity within network encoding of SCN circadian time."

The translation of a morphogen gradient into discrete spatial domains relies on precise signal responses at stable cell positions. However, cells in developing tissues undergoing morphogenesis and proliferation often experience complex movements, which may affect their morphogen exposure, specification, and positioning. How is a clear pattern achieved with cells moving around? Using in toto imaging of the zebrafish neural tube, we analyzed specification patterns and movement trajectories of neural progenitors. We found that specified progenitors of different fates are spatially mixed following heterogeneous Sonic Hedgehog signaling responses. Cell sorting then rearranges them into sharply bordered domains. Ectopically induced motor neuron progenitors also robustly sort to correct locations. Our results reveal that cell sorting acts to correct imprecision of spatial patterning by noisy inductive signals.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI0NTYwNWE5YjQyZTdkOWE4YWFjZGEzNmQzY2YwNjcxYSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3ODI4NzQ4fQ.LKdTbulxI_xiNzkG-CSd5C4ssvda8LeG7klWsgRgHrhZWX81zR23yBvA026k-MkhIuu2YRy7Mf62dvZD-teTWMBeiylPJU22u0NM5j6AWhndKLyE_nXE2quVlog0h-I8Bt-hPU7sWPIB2ZiZBXjVf9mlL0lfagPvsrKfl-9DeUaApIyZ7KUCseMPHTKw9-18wCOaOxJcUY6xcCJTsZP7KvcPmAgPX8OKWenY9dCG3_7aaGCj49YyxFo0R-uQ5o4ZTcDyHnltmj__NqTTWLpkbHBUf6kCkJat0Lf1t88Cwv3LDFc2J2vuG9wojxeDhAcgjOsbazpAk6Z2m82COgmNMA(mp4, (73.27 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2057507337,"The mitogen-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways are often concurrently activated by separate genetic alterations in colorectal cancer (CRC), which is associated with CRC progression and poor survival. However, how activating both pathways is required for CRC metastatic progression remains unclear. Our recent study showed that both ERK and AKT signaling are required to activate eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-initiated cap-dependent translation via convergent regulation of the translational repressor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) for maintaining CRC transformation. Here, we identified that the activation of cap-dependent translation by cooperative ERK and AKT signaling is critical for promotion of CRC motility and metastasis. In CRC cells with coexistent mutational activation of ERK and AKT pathways, inhibition of either MEK or AKT alone showed limited activity in inhibiting cell migration and invasion, but combined inhibition resulted in profound effects. Genetic blockade of the translation initiation complex by eIF4E knockdown or expression of a dominant active 4E-BP1 mutant effectively inhibited migration, invasion and metastasis of CRC cells, whereas overexpression of eIF4E or knockdown of 4E-BP1 had the opposite effect and markedly reduced their dependence on ERK and AKT signaling for cell motility. Mechanistically, we found that these effects were largely dependent on the increase in mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-mediated survivin translation by ERK and AKT signaling. Despite the modest effect of survivin knockdown on tumor growth, reduction of the translationally regulated survivin profoundly inhibited motility and metastasis of CRC. These findings reveal a critical mechanism underlying the translational regulation of CRC metastatic progression, and suggest that targeting cap-dependent translation may provide a promising treatment strategy for advanced CRC."

While many of the participating proteins have been identified, the molecular composition of these sites has not been characterized comprehensively. Here, we report a procedure to biochemically isolate fractions highly enriched in docked synaptic vesicles. The fraction is largely free of postsynaptic proteins and most other organelles while containing most known synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins. Numerous presynaptic transmembrane proteins were also identified, together with over 30 uncharacterized proteins, many of which are evolutionarily conserved. Quantitative proteomic comparison of glutamate- and GABA-specific docking complexes revealed that, except of neurotransmitter-specific enzymes and transporters, only few proteins were selectively enriched in either fraction. We conclude that the core machinery involved in vesicle docking and exocytosis does not show compositional differences between the two types of synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2069881137,"Despite the complexity and variety of biological oscillators, their core design invariably includes an essential negative feedback loop. In the Xenopus laevis embryonic cell cycle oscillator, this loop consists of the kinase cyclin B-Cdk1 and the ubiquitin ligase APC/C(Cdc20); active Cdk1 activates APC/C(Cdc20), which then brings about cyclin B degradation and inactivates Cdk1. Here we ask how this negative feedback loop functions quantitatively, with the aim of understanding what mechanisms keep the Cdk1-APC/C(Cdc20) system from settling into a stable steady state with intermediate levels of Cdk1 and APC/C(Cdc20) activity. We found that the system operates as a time-delayed, digital switch, with a time lag of ∼ 15 min between Cdk1 and APC/C(Cdc20) activation and a tremendously high degree of ultrasensitivity (n(H)≈17). Computational modelling shows how these attributes contribute to the generation of robust, clock-like oscillations. Principles uncovered here may also apply to other activator-repressor oscillators and help in designing robust synthetic clocks."
https://openalex.org/W2027522454,"Learning-dependent cortical encoding has been well described in single neurons. But behaviorally relevant sensory signals drive the coordinated activity of millions of cortical neurons; whether learning produces stimulus-specific changes in population codes is unknown. Because the pattern of firing rate correlations between neurons--an emergent property of neural populations--can significantly impact encoding fidelity, we hypothesize that it is a target for learning. Using an associative learning procedure, we manipulated the behavioral relevance of natural acoustic signals and examined the evoked spiking activity in auditory cortical neurons in songbirds. We show that learning produces stimulus-specific changes in the pattern of interneuronal correlations that enhance the ability of neural populations to recognize signals relevant for behavior. This learning-dependent enhancement increases with population size. The results identify the pattern of interneuronal correlation in neural populations as a target of learning that can selectively enhance the representations of specific sensory signals."

The assembly and activity of the 26S proteasome is tightly regulated by a large number of loosely associated proteins that function as regulators or cofactors (Besche et al., 2009bBesche H.C. Peth A.

One such factor is PI31, an evolutionarily conserved regulator of proteasome activity (Bader et al., 2011Bader M. Benjamin S. Wapinski O.L. Smith D.M. Goldberg A.L. Steller H.

PI31 was initially identified on the basis of its ability to inhibit 20S proteasome activity in vitro (Chu-Ping et al., 1992Chu-Ping M. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N.

However, PI31 can also activate the 26S proteasome in vitro, and mutational inactivation of the corresponding gene in Drosophila causes lethality-reduced proteasome activity and defects in protein degradation in vivo (Bader et al., 2011Bader M. Benjamin S. Wapinski O.L. Smith D.M. Goldberg A.L. Steller H. A conserved F box regulatory complex controls proteasome activity in Drosophila.Cell. 2011; 145: 371-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, PI31 serves a crucial physiological function as an activator of 26S proteasome activity. The C terminus of PI31 contains a functionally important HbYX (hydrophobic residue-tyrosine-any amino acid) motif, which is commonly found in modulators of proteasome activity, such as Rpt base subunits of the 19S regulatory particle (Gillette et al., 2008Gillette T.G.

Cell. 2007; 27: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This suggests that PI31 can bind to the 20S particle via its HbYX motif, and this may cause inhibition by hindering substrate access to the enzymatic core (Bader et al., 2011Bader M. Benjamin S. Wapinski O.L. Smith D.M. Goldberg A.L. Steller H. A conserved F box regulatory complex controls proteasome activity in Drosophila.Cell. 2011; 145: 371-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; McCutchen-Maloney et al., 2000McCutchen-Maloney S.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18557-18565Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanism by which PI31 modulates proteasome activity remains unknown. Previous work also indicated that PI31 function is regulated in vivo in order to increase 26S proteasome activity under conditions where maximal proteolytic activity is required, for example, for the removal of most cellular proteins during the terminal differentiation of sperm (Bader et al., 2011Bader M. Benjamin S. Wapinski O.L. Smith D.M. Goldberg A.L. Steller H. A conserved F box regulatory complex controls proteasome activity in Drosophila.Cell. 2011; 145: 371-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the regulation of PI31 activity, we looked for previously unrecognized binding partners of this protein and identified the ADP-ribosyltransferase tankyrase (TNKS) as a direct interactor that modulates PI31 activity. TNKS-mediated ADP-ribosylation of PI31 is necessary for the ability of this protein to stimulate 26S proteasome function, and the inhibition of TNKS reduces 26S proteasome activity in both Drosophila and mammalian cells. TNKS-mediated ADP-ribosylation of PI31 drastically reduces the affinity of this protein for binding to 20S proteasome α subunits and, thereby, relieves 20S repression by PI31. We also identified the 19S assembly chaperones dp27 and dS5b as binding partners of PI31. In this case, ADP-ribosylation of PI31 causes increased binding to dp27 and dS5b and sequestration of these assembly chaperones from 19S regulatory particles, which promotes 26S assembly. These results reveal an unexpected mechanism of proteasome regulation and define TNKS inhibitors as a distinct class of proteasome modulators that may have utility in the clinic. To gain insight into the mechanism of PI31-mediated proteasome regulation, we looked for binding partners of this protein. For this purpose, we screened a Drosophila embryo complimentary DNA (cDNA) library by far-western blot analysis using P32-labeled, HMK-tagged Drosophila PI31 (DmPI31) as a probe. This led to the identification of Drosophila tankyrase (dTNKS, CG4719) as a potential interacting protein (data not shown). dTNKS protein is 44% homologous to human tankyrase 1 and 2 (hTNKS1/2; Figure S1A available online). Next, we used coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments to investigate endogenous interactions between DmPI31 and dTNKS (Figure 1B). Extracts from wild-type (WT) embryos were immunoprecipitated with anti-DmPI31, and blots were probed with an antibody raised against dTNKS (Figures 1A and S1B). These experiments showed that dTNKS and DmPI31 form a complex in vivo (Figure 1B). We also coexpressed FLAG-tagged dTNKS and HA-tagged DmPI31 in human embryonic 293 (HEK293) cells to establish a cell-culture system for subsequent interaction studies (Figure 1C). Again, co-IP experiments with extracts from these cells showed the presence of a DmPI31:dTNKS complex (Figure 1C).Figure 1dTNKS, an Interacting Partner of DmPI31Show full caption(A) dTNKS antiserum detects purified dTNKS.

In order to identify which region of dTNKS is responsible for interaction with DmPI31, we generated truncations of dTNKS that lacked either the ANK or SAM-PARP domains and tested them for binding to DmPI31 (Figures 1D and 1E). Whereas the SAM-PARP domains were dispensable for DmPI31 binding, deletion of the ANK domain in the dTNKSΔANK mutant prevented the formation of the DmPI31:dTNKS complex (Figure 1E). This suggests that dTNKS binds DmPI31 via its ANK domain. A hallmark of TNKS-binding partners is the presence of a canonical TNKS-binding motif (RxxGxGxE/D) (Guettler et al., 2011Guettler S.

DmPI31 contains a good fit to this consensus motif at its N terminus (Figure 1F). To investigate the functional importance of this motif, we mutated this sequence by altering two amino acids (RG49/54AA) and tested binding to dTNKS. The mutant protein was no longer able to form a complex with dTNKS, indicating that this motif is required for interaction with dTNKS (Figure 1G, lane 2). To further characterize the DmPI31-dTNKS interaction, we generated DmPI31 mutants in which the C-terminal residues, including the HbYX motif, were either mutated or deleted (L210A, D211K, F241A and P243A, and ΔHbYX; Figure 1G, lanes 3–7). Whereas DmPI31D211K and DmPI31P243A mutants retained their ability to bind dTNKS, DmPI31L210A and DmPI31F241A were unable to form a complex with dTNKS (Figure 1G). Furthermore, deletion of the HbYX motif in DmPI31 also abrogated the interaction between DmPI31 and dTNKS (Figure 1G, lane 7). This suggests that dTNKS uses its ANK domain to bind DmPI31 and that both the N-terminal TNKS-binding motif and the C-terminal HbYX domain of DmPI31 are required for interaction with dTNKS. TNKSs modulate the activity of target proteins by ADP-ribosylation (Hsiao and Smith, 2008Hsiao S.J. Smith S.

Here, we report that loxp/cre-mediated CNS deletion of TR4, a testicular orphan nuclear receptor, results in loss of many excitatory interneurons in the superficial dorsal horn but preservation of primary afferents and spinal projection neurons. The interneuron loss is associated with a near complete absence of supraspinally integrated pain and itch behaviors, elevated mechanical withdrawal thresholds and loss of nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity, but reflex responsiveness to noxious heat, nerve injury-induced heat hypersensitivity, and tissue injury-induced heat and mechanical hypersensitivity are intact. We conclude that different subsets of dorsal horn excitatory interneurons contribute to tissue and nerve injury-induced heat and mechanical pain and that the full expression of supraspinally mediated pain and itch behaviors cannot be generated solely by nociceptor and pruritoceptor activation of projection neurons; concurrent activation of excitatory interneurons is essential."
https://openalex.org/W2089577462,"ClpX, a AAA+ ring homohexamer, uses the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to power conformational changes that unfold and translocate target proteins into the ClpP peptidase for degradation. In multiple crystal structures, some ClpX subunits adopt nucleotide-loadable conformations, others adopt unloadable conformations, and each conformational class exhibits substantial variability. Using mutagenesis of individual subunits in covalently tethered hexamers together with fluorescence methods to assay the conformations and nucleotide-binding properties of these subunits, we demonstrate that dynamic interconversion between loadable and unloadable conformations is required to couple ATP hydrolysis by ClpX to mechanical work. ATP binding to different classes of subunits initially drives staged allosteric changes, which set the conformation of the ring to allow hydrolysis and linked mechanical steps. Subunit switching between loadable and unloadable conformations subsequently isomerizes or resets the configuration of the nucleotide-loaded ring and is required for mechanical function."

In contrast to the canonical GTP/GDP switch that regulates most Ras superfamily members, our results reveal an unprecedented mechanism for G protein inhibition by 14-3-3 proteins. Most Ras superfamily G proteins cycle between an inactive GDP-bound conformation and an active GTP-bound conformation, which signals to downstream targets to induce cellular responses. They are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and inactivated by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which catalyze GTP hydrolysis. The three Rnd proteins, Rnd1, Rnd2, and Rnd3 (also known as RhoE) are a subfamily of the Rho GTPase family with atypical properties (Foster et al., 1996Foster R. Hu K.Q. Lu Y. Nolan K.M. Thissen J.

Rnd proteins: multifunctional regulators of the cytoskeleton and cell cycle progression.Bioessays. 2010; 32: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). They are constitutively GTP-bound because they have amino acid substitutions in key residues involved in GTP hydrolysis, and have a very low affinity for GDP. Their activity must therefore be regulated differently to classic G proteins (Riou et al., 2010Riou P. Villalonga P. Ridley A.J. Rnd proteins: multifunctional regulators of the cytoskeleton and cell cycle progression.Bioessays. 2010; 32: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For Rnd3, one such mechanism is phosphorylation by Rho-associated coiled coil containing protein kinase (ROCK)1 and protein kinase C (PKC)α, which shifts Rnd3 subcellular localization from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm and increases its stability (Madigan et al., 2009Madigan J.P. Bodemann B.O. Brady D.C. Dewar B.J. Keller P.J. Leitges M. Philips M.R. Ridley A.J. Der C.J. Cox A.D.

The molecular basis for these effects remains uncharacterized. Rnd2 localizes predominantly to the cytoplasm, whereas Rnd1 is normally localized on membranes (Roberts et al., 2008Roberts P.J. Mitin N. Keller P.J. Chenette E.J. Madigan J.P. Currin R.O. Cox A.D. Wilson O. Kirschmeier P. Der C.J. Rho Family GTPase modification and dependence on CAAX motif-signaled posttranslational modification.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25150-25163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Whether the localization of Rnd1 and Rnd2 is also regulated by phosphorylation is not known. Like most Ras superfamily G proteins, Rnd proteins are posttranslationally polyisoprenylated on a Cys residue, four amino acids from the C terminus (Cys of the CAAX box motif, where C represents cysteine; A an aliphatic amino acid; and X any amino acid residue, which determines the type of isoprenyl group). Isoprenylation is followed by proteolytic removal of the AAX amino acids and carboxymethylation of the polyisoprenylcysteine. These irreversible modifications mediate the interaction of the GTPases with membranes and are generally required for their biological functions. Basic residues near the C terminus of some GTPases such as Rac1 and K-Ras4B also contribute to their membrane localization (Hancock et al., 1990Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J.

The C-terminal domain of Rac1 contains two motifs that control targeting and signaling specificity.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39166-39175Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Rho GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are posttranslationally modified by a 20-carbon geranylgeranyl lipid and are solubilized from membranes and sequestered in the cytosol in an inactive state by binding to RhoGDIs, which have a hydrophobic pocket that accommodates the geranylgeranyl group (Hoffman et al., 2000Hoffman G.R.

Structure of the Rho family GTP-binding protein Cdc42 in complex with the multifunctional regulator RhoGDI.Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In contrast, Rnd proteins are modified by a shorter 15-carbon farnesyl group (Foster et al., 1996Foster R. Hu K.Q. Lu Y. Nolan K.M. Thissen J. Settleman J.

Chem. 2008; 283: 25150-25163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and Rnd3 does not bind and therefore is not extracted from membranes by RhoGDIs (Forget et al., 2002Forget M.A. Desrosiers R.R. Gingras D. Béliveau R. Phosphorylation states of Cdc42 and RhoA regulate their interactions with Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor and their extraction from biological membranes.Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This implies the existence of an alternative mechanism for the Rnd proteins to localize in the cytosol. Rnd1 and Rnd3 induce loss of stress fibers and cell rounding (hence the name Rnd) in a variety of cell types and can stimulate cell migration (Riou et al., 2010Riou P. Villalonga P. Ridley A.J. Rnd proteins: multifunctional regulators of the cytoskeleton and cell cycle progression.Bioessays. 2010; 32: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One way in which Rnd proteins regulate cell morphology is by inhibiting the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway and hence antagonizing actomyosin contractility. Overexpression of Rnd1 and Rnd3 stimulates p190RhoGAP activity, which reduces the amount of GTP-bound RhoA and decreases stress fibers (Wennerberg et al., 2003Wennerberg K. Forget M.A. Ellerbroek S.M. Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Settleman J. Der C.J. Hansen S.H. Rnd proteins function as RhoA antagonists by activating p190 RhoGAP.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1106-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Rnd3 also inhibits actomyosin contractility at cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells during collective cell migration (Hidalgo-Carcedo et al., 2011Hidalgo-Carcedo C. Hooper S. Chaudhry S.I. Williamson P. Harrington K. Leitinger B. Sahai E. Collective cell migration requires suppression of actomyosin at cell-cell contacts mediated by DDR1 and the cell polarity regulators Par3 and Par6.Nat. Cell Biol. 2011; 13: 49-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Here, we identify 14-3-3 proteins as Rnd interaction partners. 14-3-3 proteins are regulatory molecules that bind many functionally diverse proteins, usually by interacting with Ser/Thr phosphorylated residues (Obsil and Obsilova, 2011Obsil T. Obsilova V. Structural basis of 14-3-3 protein functions.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 22: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). We show that 14-3-3 binds Rnd proteins through a phosphorylated Ser residue and the adjacent C-terminal farnesyl group. By solving the crystal structure of a C-terminal Rnd3 peptide/14-3-3 complex, we show that 14-3-3 proteins directly interact with the farnesyl group via a hydrophobic surface, revealing lipid binding to 14-3-3. Using a consensus motif based on the Rnd3 C-terminal sequence, we identify several proteins with potential to bind to 14-3-3 in a similar fashion to Rnd3 and show that among them geranylgeranylated Rap1A interacts with 14-3-3. Therefore, 14-3-3 proteins can act as solubilizing factors specifically for phosphorylated and prenylated proteins from the Ras superfamily, translocating them from their site-of-action—on membranes—to the cytosol and consequently inhibiting their function. Rnd3 was identified in immunoprecipitates of 14-3-3ε (Michael Yaffe, personal communication), and four endogenous 14-3-3 isoforms (β, ε, γ, ζ) were identified as Rnd3-binding partners by mass spectrometry analysis (Table S1 available online). This is the first time a Ras superfamily G protein has been reported to bind to 14-3-3 proteins. Seven 14-3-3 isoforms are known in mammals (Morrison, 2009Morrison D.K. The 14-3-3 proteins: integrators of diverse signaling cues that impact cell fate and cancer development.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 16-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and because all isoforms coimmunoprecipitated with Rnd3 (Figure S1A), no isoform specificity was observed. In most cases, 14-3-3 proteins interact with phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues on their target proteins (Morrison, 2009Morrison D.K. The 14-3-3 proteins: integrators of diverse signaling cues that impact cell fate and cancer development.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 16-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with the general kinase inhibitor staurosporine reduced Rnd3/14-3-3 interaction, and conversely the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A increased the interaction (Figure S1B). In addition, treatment of Rnd3 immunoprecipitates with calf-intestinal phosphatase to dephosphorylate Rnd3 abolished subsequent interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (Figure 1A). Rnd3 phosphorylation is therefore required for binding to 14-3-3. Previously, we identified seven Ser/Thr residues in Rnd3 that can be phosphorylated in vitro by ROCK1, two near the N terminus and five near the C terminus (Riento et al., 2005Riento K. Totty N. Villalonga P. Garg R. Guasch R. Ridley A.J. RhoE function is regulated by ROCK I-mediated phosphorylation.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1170-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar; Figure 1B). PKC also phosphorylates Rnd3 on one or more of these sites (Madigan et al., 2009Madigan J.P. Bodemann B.O. Brady D.C. Dewar B.J. Keller P.J. Leitges M. Philips M.R. Ridley A.J. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Regulation of Rnd3 localization and function by protein kinase C alpha-mediated phosphorylation.Biochem. J. 2009; 424: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutation of all seven sites to Ala (Rnd3-AllA; Figure 1B) prevented Rnd3 from binding to recombinant GST-14-3-3β in vitro or endogenous 14-3-3 proteins in cells (Figures S1C and S1E), indicating that at least one of these residues is involved in the interaction. Deletion of the Rnd3 C terminus, but not the N terminus, abolished 14-3-3 interaction (Figures S1D and S1E), implicating C-terminal residues specifically. To map which Rnd3 phosphorylation site(s) mediate 14-3-3 interaction, each Ser/Thr was individually mutated to Ala. Mutation of Rnd3 S240 alone totally prevented the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, whereas mutation of either S210 or S218 reduced the interaction (Figure 1C). A putative phosphomimetic mutant, Rnd3-S240D, did not bind 14-3-3 proteins (Figure 1D), in accordance with previous studies showing that 14-3-3 proteins require phosphate groups and not simply negatively charged amino acid side chains for binding (Muslin et al., 1996Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Interaction of 14-3-3 with signaling proteins is mediated by the recognition of phosphoserine.Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar; Obsil and Obsilova, 2011Obsil T. Obsilova V. Structural basis of 14-3-3 protein functions.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 22: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To determine whether any single phosphorylation site(s) was sufficient for 14-3-3 binding, each of the phosphorylation sites was reintroduced individually or in combination into the Rnd3-AllA background. Of these Rnd3 mutants, only Rnd3-AllA-S210+S240 and Rnd3-AllA-S218+S240 could interact similarly to wild-type (WT) Rnd3 (Figure 1E; data not shown), whereas Rnd3-AllA-S240 displayed a weak interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (Figure S1F). Taken together, this indicates that S240 phosphorylation is essential for interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and that either S210 or S218 phosphorylation is also required in combination with S240 for optimal binding. These three phosphorylation sites and surrounding amino acids are completely conserved in Rnd3 proteins from a range of species (Figure S1G; note that Rnd3 is only present in vertebrates [Boureux et al., 2007Boureux A. Vignal E. Faure S. Fort P. Evolution of the Rho family of ras-like GTPases in eukaryotes.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 203-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar]), providing strong evidence that they play an important role in Rnd3 function. Both ROCK1 (but not ROCK2) and PKC are reported to phosphorylate Rnd3, although the site(s) phosphorylated by PKC have not been identified (Madigan et al., 2009Madigan J.P. Bodemann B.O. Brady D.C. Dewar B.J. Keller P.J. Leitges M. Philips M.R. Ridley A.J. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Regulation of Rnd3 localization and function by protein kinase C alpha-mediated phosphorylation.Biochem. J. 2009; 424: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar; Riento et al., 2005Riento K. Totty N. Villalonga P. Garg R. Guasch R. Ridley A.J. RhoE function is regulated by ROCK I-mediated phosphorylation.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1170-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To determine which sites were phosphorylated by ROCK1 or PKC, Rnd3 phosphosite mutants were expressed in COS7 cells, and immunoprecipitated Rnd3 was incubated with ROCK1 kinase domain or PKCζ kinase domain (Figure 2A). ROCK1 phosphorylated each of the seven Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites but S210 had a much lower level of phosphorylation than the other six sites. In contrast, only S210 was effectively phosphorylated by PKCζ. Hence, of the Rnd3 residues involved in 14-3-3 binding, S210 is a target for PKC, whereas both S218 and S240 are ROCK targets (Figure 2A). Note that PKC kinase domains have overlapping substrate specificity in vitro (Nishikawa et al., 1997Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Determination of the specific substrate sequence motifs of protein kinase C isozymes.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and S210 could potentially be phosphorylated by any PKC isoform, although PKCα seems to be the predominant isoform acting on Rnd3 in PMA-stimulated fibroblasts (Madigan et al., 2009Madigan J.P. Bodemann B.O. Brady D.C. Dewar B.J. Keller P.J. Leitges M. Philips M.R. Ridley A.J. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Regulation of Rnd3 localization and function by protein kinase C alpha-mediated phosphorylation.Biochem. J. 2009; 424: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutation of Ser240 to Thr did not affect 14-3-3 binding (Figure 1D), indicating that ROCK1 is likely to phosphorylate either Ser or Thr residues equally efficiently at this position. To investigate the phosphorylation status of the three Rnd3 phosphorylation sites involved in 14-3-3 binding in cells, we first generated an antibody specific to pSer210 of Rnd3. Treatment of cells with PMA but not overexpression of ROCK11–420 stimulated an increase in pS210-Rnd3 and binding to 14-3-3, whereas the PKC inhibitor BIM1 reduced pS210-Rnd3, indicating that S210 is a PKC phosphorylation site in cells (Figure 2B). This antibody did not recognize other phosphorylation sites in Rnd3 (Figure 2C; data not shown). Mass spectrometry analysis of immunoprecipitated FLAG-Rnd3 was used to show that S218 and S240 were phosphorylated in cells expressing ROCK11–420 or treated with calyculin A (Figures S2A and S2B). Because S240 is adjacent to C241, which is normally farnesylated and methylated, we developed a methodology using synthetic peptides as references in order to be able to identify C-terminal modifications on Rnd3 immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. Rnd3-pS240 was specifically detected in a farnesylated, methylated peptide (Figure S2B). As a control, clear identification of the farnesylated but not phosphorylated, C-terminal sequence was obtained for Rnd3-S240A (data not shown). We also monitored Rnd3 phosphorylation in parallel to 14-3-3 binding using a pSer antibody raised against PKC substrate consensus sequences. Inhibition of PKC or ROCK decreased levels of Rnd3 phosphorylation detected with this pSer antibody, whereas in cells expressing constitutively active ROCK11–420 or stimulated with PMA, the levels increased (Figure 2B). This indicates that the antibody recognizes both ROCK1 and PKC phosphosites. Indeed, PKCs and ROCKs are both from the AGC family of kinases and have very similar consensus phosphorylation sites (Pearce et al., 2010Pearce L.R. Komander D. Alessi D.R. The nuts and bolts of AGC protein kinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). The pSer antibody binding to Rnd3 was strongly reduced by mutation of S210, S218, or S240, and similar to wild-type Rnd3 for the AllA-S210, S218, S240 mutant (Figure 2C), indicating that these are the major phosphosites that it recognizes. Similar results were observed using the Pro-Q Diamond reagent to measure Rnd3 phosphorylation (see Extended Experimental Procedures) (Figures 2B and 2C). These results together demonstrate for the first time that Rnd3 is phosphorylated in cells on S210 by PKC and on S218 and S240 by ROCK, leading to 14-3-3 binding (Figure S2C). Unlike Rnd3, phosphorylation of Rnd1 and Rnd2 has not been reported. Both Rnd1 and Rnd2 possess a Ser residue equivalent to Rnd3-S240 next to the CAAX box, as well as several other potential phosphorylation sites close to the C terminus (Figure 2D). These sites, however, are not conserved between the Rnd isoforms. We detected phosphorylation of Rnd1 and Rnd2 in cells, which was increased following addition of phosphatase inhibitor (calyculin A) to cells prior to lysis (Figure 2E). Under these conditions, and correlating with their level of phosphorylation, Rnd1 and Rnd2 were able to interact with 14-3-3 proteins (Figure 2E). Mutation of S228 in Rnd1 and S223 in Rnd2, both next to the CAAX box (Figure 2D), prevented 14-3-3 binding (Figure 2F). This suggests that Rnd1 and Rnd2 are regulated similarly to Rnd3 by C-terminal phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. Exogenous expression of Rnd3 typically induces cell rounding with long thin protrusions due to inhibition of Rho activity and subsequent loss of stress fibers and focal adhesions (Guasch et al., 1998Guasch R.M. Scambler P. Jones G.E. Ridley A.J. RhoE regulates actin cytoskeleton organization and cell migration.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4761-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar; Nobes et al., 1998Nobes C.D. Lauritzen I. Mattei M.G. Paris S. Hall A. Chardin P. A new member of the Rho family, Rnd1, promotes disassembly of actin filament structures and loss of cell adhesion.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This response is mediated in part by the interaction of Rnd3 with p190RhoGAP and stimulation of its GAP activity toward RhoA (Wennerberg et al., 2003Wennerberg K. Forget M.A. Ellerbroek S.M. Arthur W.T. Burridge K. Settleman J. Der C.J. Hansen S.H. Rnd proteins function as RhoA antagonists by activating p190 RhoGAP.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1106-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The Rnd3/14-3-3 interaction is not necessary for Rnd3-induced cell rounding because Rnd3-AllA, and other Rnd3 mutants defective in their ability to bind 14-3-3 proteins, induced a similar rounding response to wild-type Rnd3 in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (Figure S3A). Both wild-type and Rnd3 phosphomutants localized to the plasma membrane in all cells with a rounded phenotype. Rnd3-AllA coimmunoprecipitated with p190RhoGAP-B, similar to WT Rnd3 (Figure S3B), and thus 14-3-3 binding is not required for this interaction. As a control, Rnd3-T55V did not interact with p190RhoGAP-B (Figure S3B), consistent with previous data (Pacary et al., 2011Pacary E. Heng J. Azzarelli R. Riou P. Castro D. Lebel-Potter M. Parras C. Bell D.M. Ridley A.J. Parsons M. Guillemot F.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1106-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rnd3/14-3-3 and Rnd3/p190RhoGAP-B were in two mutually exclusive complexes: immunoprecipitates of p190RhoGAP-B contained Rnd3 but not 14-3-3 proteins, and conversely immunoprecipitates of 14-3-3 proteins contained Rnd3 but not p190RhoGAP-B (Figure S3C). In addition, Rnd3 bound to 14-3-3 proteins was phosphorylated on S210, whereas Rnd3 bound to p190RhoGAP-B was not (Figure S3C). This suggests that phosphorylation of Rnd3 increases its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and reduces interaction with the effector p190RhoGAP. We next investigated whether 14-3-3 binding inhibited Rnd3 function. As described above, Rnd3 and Rnd3-A240 both induced loss of stress fibers and cell rounding (Figures 3A, and S3A). Coexpression of 14-3-3β significantly inhibited the rounding response induced by wild-type Rnd3, but not Rnd3-A240, whereas 14-3-3β expression alone did not alter cell morphology (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3D; Table S2). By contrast, a mutant 14-3-3 protein that is defective for substrate binding (Thorson et al., 1998Thorson J.A. Yu L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. 14-3-3 proteins are required for maintenance of Raf-1 phosphorylation and kinase activity.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) did not inhibit Rnd3-induced cell rounding (data not shown). This provides evidence that the effect of 14-3-3β on cell morphology is specific to binding and inhibition of Rnd3 and not due to binding to another cellular target. Because 14-3-3 proteins bind to the C-terminal region of Rnd3 close to the farnesylation site (Figure S2C), we hypothesized that 14-3-3 binding could affect Rnd3 subcellular localization and consequently negatively regulate Rnd3 function. Indeed, as observed by immunofluorescence, 14-3-3β overexpression dramatically reduced the localization of Rnd3 but not Rnd3-A240 at the plasma membrane (Figure 3B). Importantly, the rounding response to WT Rnd3 and Rnd3-S240A correlated with Rnd3 localization at the plasma membrane (Figures 3B, S3A, and S3E). Similar to Rnd3, 14-3-3 overexpression inhibited Rnd1- and Rnd2-induced morphological changes, indicating that the function of all 3 Rnd proteins can be inhibited by 14-3-3 interaction (Figure S3F). To confirm the effect of 14-3-3 proteins on Rnd3 localization, we investigated Rnd3 association with membranes by biochemical fractionation. Rnd3 was equally distributed between the cytosolic and membrane fractions but absent from the nuclear fraction. Coexpression of 14-3-3β and/or ROCK1 increased the proportion of Rnd3 in the cytosolic fraction, concomitant with reduced levels of Rnd3 in the membrane fraction (Figure 3C, upper left). In contrast, Rnd3-S240A localization was unaffected by ROCK1 or 14-3-3β expression (Figure 3C, upper right). 14-3-3 proteins localized to all fractions (Figure 3C, lower), as expected given their large number of cellular partners (Morrison, 2009Morrison D.K. The 14-3-3 proteins: integrators of diverse signaling cues that impact cell fate and cancer development.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 16-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). As a control, a Rnd3-C241S mutant was tested. C241 is the site of farnesyl group addition to Rnd3 (Figure S2C). Rnd3-C241S could not bind to membranes and localized only in the cytosolic fraction, as expected (Figure 3C, lower). Additional controls using PMA or calyculin A to increase Rnd3 phosphorylation or staurosporine to reduce phosphorylation showed that unphosphorylated Rnd3 mainly localizes to the membrane fraction, whereas phosphorylated Rnd3 accumulates in the cytosol (Figure 3C, lower panels). In addition, pS210-Rnd3 localized only in the cytosolic fraction and not the membrane fraction (Figure S3G), supporting our data indicating that Rnd3 phosphorylation induces translocation from the membrane to the cytosol through 14-3-3 binding. Taken together, these results indicate that plasma membrane-localized Rnd3 is active, binds p190RhoGAP and induces cell rounding and thin protrusions, whereas upon phosphorylation followed by subsequent 14-3-3 binding, it translocates to the cytosol where it is inactive and cannot alter cell morphology. The proximity of Rnd3 pS240 to farnesylated C241 (Figure S2C) led us to investigate the influence of farnesylation on 14-3-3 binding. We therefore mutated C241 to either G or S, or deleted the last four amino acids (Rnd3ΔCAAX), thus preventing Rnd3 farnesylation. Strikingly, none of the three CAAX box mutants interacted with 14-3-3 proteins (Figure 4A). Rnd3-C241S did not localize to the plasma membrane but in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Figures S4A and 3C), as expected in the absence of farnesylation (Roberts et al., 2008Roberts P.J. Mitin N. Keller P.J. Chenette E.J. Madigan J.P. Currin R.O. Cox A.D. Wilson O. Kirschmeier P. Der C.J. Rho Family GTPase modification and dependence on CAAX motif-signaled posttranslational modification.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25150-25163Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Rnd3ΔC, which lacks the C-terminal phosphorylation sites and the CAAX box (Figure S1D), as expected, did not bind to 14-3-3 proteins (Figure 4A). Addition of a CAAX box to Rnd3ΔC did not restore 14-3-3 protein binding (Figure 4A), which is consistent with the requirement for the Rnd3 C-terminal phosphorylation sites for 14-3-3 interaction (Figures 1 and 2). As the interaction between Rnd3 and 14-3-3 proteins requires Rnd3 phosphorylation, the above data could be explained by the fact that Rnd3 needs to be at the plasma membrane, where it can be phosphorylated by the relevant kinases, and only then capable of binding 14-3-3 proteins. However, analysis of Rnd3 phosphorylation status revealed that this is unlikely because the different Rnd3 CAAX box mutants were still phosphorylated to comparable levels as the wild-type Rnd3 (Pro-Q Diamond, pS210; Figure 4A).Figure S4Farnesylation Is Required for Rnd3 Binding"
https://openalex.org/W2133257381,"In the study of decision making, emphasis is placed on different forms of perceptual integration, while the influence of other factors, such as memory, is ignored. In addition, it is believed that the information underlying decision making is carried in the rate of the neuronal response, while its variability is considered unspecific. Here we studied the influence of recent experience on motor decision making by analyzing the activity of neurons in the dorsal premotor area of two monkeys performing a countermanding arm task. We observe that the across-trial variability of the neural response strongly correlates with trial history-dependent changes in reaction time. Using a theoretical model of decision making, we show that a trial history-monitoring signal can explain the observed behavioral and neural modulation. Our study reveals that, in the neural processes that culminate in motor plan maturation, the evidence provided by perception and memory is reflected in mean rate and variance respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1978187692,"The mechanisms by which early spatiotemporal expression patterns of transcription factors such as Pax6 regulate cortical progenitors in a region-specific manner are poorly understood. Pax6 is expressed in a gradient across the developing cortex and is essential for normal corticogenesis. We found that constitutive or conditional loss of Pax6 increases cortical progenitor proliferation by amounts that vary regionally with normal Pax6 levels. We compared the gene expression profiles of equivalent Pax6-expressing progenitors isolated from Pax6+/+ and Pax6−/− cortices and identified many negatively regulated cell-cycle genes, including Cyclins and Cdks. Biochemical assays indicated that Pax6 directly represses Cdk6 expression. Cyclin/Cdk repression inhibits retinoblastoma protein (pRb) phosphorylation, thereby limiting the transcription of genes that directly promote the mechanics of the cell cycle, and we found that Pax6 inhibits pRb phosphorylation and represses genes involved in DNA replication. Our results indicate that Pax6’s modulation of cortical progenitor cell cycles is regional and direct."
https://openalex.org/W1995065817,"In the primate visual system, area V4 is located in the ventral pathway and is traditionally thought to be involved in processing color and form information. However, little is known about its functional role in processing motion information. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging over large fields of view in V1, V2, and V4, we mapped the direction of motion responses in anesthetized macaques. We found that V4 contains direction-preferring domains that are preferentially activated by stimuli moving in one direction. These direction-preferring domains normally occupy several restricted regions of V4 and tend to overlap with orientation- and color-preferring domains. Single-cell recordings targeting these direction-preferring domains also showed a clustering, as well as a columnar organization of V4 direction-selective neurons. These data suggest that, in contrast to the classical view, motion information is also processed in ventral pathway regions such as area V4."
https://openalex.org/W2039544755,"Both orexin and neurotensin are expressed in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and have been implicated in the regulation of feeding, motor activity and the reward system. A double label immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization studies showed that neurotensin colocalizes with orexin in neurons of the LHA. Pharmacological studies suggested that neurotensin excites orexin-producing neurons (orexin neurons) through activation of neurotensin receptor-2 (NTSR-2) and non-selective cation channels. In situ hybridization study showed that most orexin neurons express neurotensin receptor-2 mRNA but not neurotensin receptor-1 (Ntsr-1) mRNA. Immunohistochemical studies showed that neurotensin-immunoreactive fibers make appositions to orexin neurons. A neurotensin receptor antagonist decreased Fos expression in orexin neurons and wakefulness time in wild type mice when administered intraperitoneally. However, the antagonist did not evoke any effect on these parameters in orexin neuron-ablated mice. These observations suggest the importance of neurotensin in maintaining activity of orexin neurons. The evidence presented here expands our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of orexin neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2041634669,"Control of protein synthesis is critical for synaptic plasticity and memory formation. However, the molecular mechanisms linking neuronal activity to activation of mRNA translation are not fully understood. Here, we report that the translational repressor poly(A)-binding protein (PABP)-interacting protein 2A (PAIP2A), an inhibitor of PABP, is rapidly proteolyzed by calpains in stimulated neurons and following training for contextual memory. Paip2a knockout mice exhibit a lowered threshold for the induction of sustained long-term potentiation and an enhancement of long-term memory after weak training. Translation of CaMKIIα mRNA is enhanced in Paip2a⁻/⁻ slices upon tetanic stimulation and in the hippocampus of Paip2a⁻/⁻ mice following contextual fear learning. We demonstrate that activity-dependent degradation of PAIP2A relieves translational inhibition of memory-related genes through PABP reactivation and conclude that PAIP2A is a pivotal translational regulator of synaptic plasticity and memory."

Finally, the late modulation was correlated with behavioral performance of contour saliency and the monkeys’ perceptual report. Thus, opposing responses in the contour and background may underlie perceptual grouping in V1. The perceptual grouping of similarly oriented, discrete elements into a continuous contour is known as “contour integration” (Field et al., 1993Field D.J. Hayes A. Hess R.F.

In this process, the salient contour can be detected even when embedded in a noisy background. Previous psychophysical studies have explored the local interactions between collinear elements comprising contour paths (Field et al., 1993Field D.J. Hayes A. Hess R.F.

The main observation was enhanced neuronal activity for collinear elements or a contour, and this activity enhancement was dependent on contour saliency. Additional studies have suggested that visual binding is encoded by response amplitude, e.g., increased firing rate (Barlow, 1972Barlow H.B.

Despite recent progress, the neuronal mechanisms underlying contour integration are not fully understood. Specifically, the spatiotemporal patterns of population response in the contour and background areas, their relation to contour saliency, and contour detection remain unclear, in particular, at the single-trial level. To address these issues, we trained two monkeys on a contour-detection task and recorded the population responses in V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) at high spatial and temporal resolution (Shoham et al., 1999Shoham D. Glaser D.E. Arieli A. Kenet T. Wijnbergen C. Toledo Y. Hildesheim R. Grinvald A.

Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 3421-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This allowed us to investigate and directly visualize the spatiotemporal patterns of population responses evolving in contour integration. Our results unravel a spatiotemporal interplay of population response during the processes of contour integration and their relation to contour detection, contour saliency, and perceptual decision. Two monkeys were trained on a contour-detection task (see Experimental Procedures). In each trial, the monkeys were presented with one of two visual stimuli and were required to discriminate between a contour and a noncontour stimulus (Figure 1A). The stimulus in the contour trials was comprised from a circular contour (“circle”) embedded within an array of randomly oriented and positioned Gabor elements (“background”). In the noncontour trials, the stimulus was composed from background alone, with the background elements identical to the contour condition, while the circle elements were randomly rotated along the circle path (Figure 1A; Experimental Procedures). The monkeys could easily perform the task (reaching a detection performance of 80%–91%), while we imaged the population responses in V1 at high spatial and temporal resolution using voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI). The dye signal measures the sum of membrane potential from all neuronal elements in the imaged area. Therefore, the voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) signal from each pixel sums the membrane potential from neuronal populations (rather than single cells) emphasizing subthreshold synaptic potentials (Grinvald and Hildesheim, 2004Grinvald A. Hildesheim R. VSDI: a new era in functional imaging of cortical dynamics.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 874-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Data analysis was performed on a total of 30 and 22 recording sessions from two hemispheres of two monkeys. To study the population responses in the contour and noncontour trials, we first needed to retinotopically map the visual stimuli onto the V1 area (see Experimental Procedures). The stimulus part that is mapped onto V1 imaged area is approximately outlined by a yellow rectangle in Figures 1A and 1B. This part of the stimulus includes few Gabor elements comprising part of the circle and the background. To map these elements onto the imaged area, we performed another set of experiments, where the monkeys were passively fixating and briefly presented on each trial with one or two individual Gabor elements comprising parts of the circle or background (Figure 1C, top row). The VSDI-activation maps, i.e., population-response maps, evoked by the Gabor elements belonging to the circle (C1–C3) and background (Bg1–Bg3) allow easy visualization and accurate localization of individual Gabor elements on V1 (Figure 1C, bottom row). Figure 1D shows an early-activation map evoked by the contour stimulus, where the activation patches over V1 clearly corresponded to the individual Gabor elements in the circle and background. We defined two regions of interest (ROIs; Figure 1D): (1) A circle area (C) was defined by contouring the area in V1 that was activated by the circle elements (C1–C3). (2) A background area (Bg) was defined by contouring the area in V1 that was activated by the background elements (Bg1–Bg3). The retinotopic mapping enabled us to analyze the population responses (VSDI amplitude) in the circle and background area evoked in the contour-detection task. Time courses of such responses from a typical recording session are shown in Figure 2. During the “early phase” of the response (40–140 ms after stimulus onset), the population-response (Figures 2A and 2B) and activation maps (Figure 2C) were similar among the contour and noncontour trials. Maps measured from both conditions showed clear activation patches corresponding to the individual Gabor elements comprising the stimuli. That is, the population response in the early phase appeared to encode mainly the representation of individual Gabor elements without any obvious circle/background segregation (see also Figures S1A–S1D available online). To further analyze this, we made a scatterplot of the population response in individual V1 pixels for the two conditions (Figure 2D). The red lines depict the activity differences between contour and noncontour trials before stimulus onset, i.e., the 1% and 99% percentile of the differences histogram (these values were then extrapolated to later times of stimulus presentation). Most pixels in the circle and background areas showed similar response amplitude and therefore lie within the red boundaries (Figure 2D). The pixel differences histograms (contour-noncontour; Figure 2E) are centered on zero (d′ = 0.04 between circle and background histograms. This is not significantly different from d′ computed for trials with shuffled labels, mean d′ = 0.04, p = 0.53, 100 iterations). This means that from 60 to 80 ms the population response in V1 pixels did not differ between the contour and noncontour conditions. This situation changed completely in the “late phase” of the response (150–250 ms after stimulus onset). Whereas the population response in the circle area was only slightly higher for the contour condition (Figure 2A, late phase), the time course of the population response in the background area showed suppression (Figure 2B). This suppression was prominent in the contour condition, starting∼140 ms after stimulus onset and reaching minimal amplitude at ∼250 ms after stimulus onset. Remarkably, the neural activation map of the late phase in the contour condition showed a clear amplitude segregation of the circle contour from the background (Figure 2F), with the high activation in the circle area simply “popping out” from the suppressed activation in the background area (see also Figure S1E, available online, for similar results in monkey S). To further analyze this, we made a scatterplot of the population response of individual V1 pixels for the two conditions (Figure 2G; red lines as in 2D). Fifty percent of V1 pixels lie above the upper boundary in the circle area (Figure 2G, left; cf. early phase Figure 2D, left). In the background area, 66% of the pixels lie below the lower boundary (Figure 2G, right cf. early phase Figure 2D, right). The pixel differences histograms (contour-noncontour; Figure 2H) are shifted from zero (d′ = 2.02 between circle and background histograms. This is significantly different from d′ computed for trials with shuffled labels, mean d′ = 0.01, p < 0.01, 100 iterations). That is, during the late phase, the population response in the background area was suppressed in the contour condition, whereas the population response in the circle area was slightly higher in the contour condition. The results reported for the background were highly similar when we analyzed an extended background area that included any imaged background elements (Figures S2A and S2B). Our results enable to directly visualize how the entire circle area (in the imaged V1) “pops out” from the background area. We further show that contour integration involves figure-ground segregation, where there is not only increased response amplitude in the “figure” (circle area; Bauer and Heinze, 2002Bauer R. Heinze S. Contour integration in striate cortex. Classic cell responses or cooperative selection?.Exp. Brain Res. 2002; 147: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar; Li et al., 2006Li W. Piëch V. Gilbert C.D. Contour saliency in primary visual cortex.Neuron. 2006; 50: 951-962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), but, importantly, also decreased response in the “ground” (background area). To quantify the neuronal activity difference between circle and background (i.e., figure-ground segregation) in all recording sessions, a figure-ground measure (FG-m) was computed for the population response. FG-m was defined as the difference in population response between the circle and background areas (see Experimental Procedures): FG-m = (Pc-Pb)cont − (Pc-Pb)non-cont where Pc and Pb are the population responses in the circle and background areas, respectively, cont and non-cont are the contour and noncontour conditions, respectively. FG-m was computed as function of time, for each frame. Although the FG-m started to increase early (Figure 3Ai, 90 and 70 ms, monkeys L and S, respectively, p < 0.05, sign-ranked two-tailed test for a significant difference from zero), it reached 3- to 6-fold only in the late phase, peaking ∼250 ms after stimulus onset for both monkeys (Figures 3Aii and 3Aiii; p < 0.01 for both monkeys). The FG-m in the late phase was higher for monkey L than for monkey S (Figure 3Aiii). This can be linked to the superior behavioral performance of monkey L (91%) compared to that of monkey S (80%). The increase in the FG-m (found for both monkeys) could have resulted from an increased population response in the circle area or a suppressed population response in the background area or both. To test which occurred in our experiments, we examined the population response in the circle and background areas separately. Figure 3B shows data from all recording sessions with monkey L (upper panels) and S (lower panels). Figure 3Bi shows the differential circle response (Pccont − Pcnon-cont; see Experimental Procedures) and differential background response (Pbcont − Pbnon-cont; see Experimental Procedures) as function of time. In the early phase, both monkeys showed a small, nonsignificant difference (Figure 3Bii). A much larger and significant difference appeared in the late phase, both in the circle (response enhancement) and background areas (response suppression; Figure 3Biii). The suppression in the background was evident also for an extended background area (Figure S2). The enhancement in the circle area and the suppression in the background is clearly not limited to the ROIs of individual Gabors (Figures 2F, 2G, and S1E), and the suppression in the background area extends over a large area of several square millimeters. Finally, we note that the background part of the stimulus was identical in both contour and noncontour trials; nevertheless, the population responses were different. This may suggest that the population responses in the late phase are better linked to perceptual grouping rather than to specific stimulus features. To further study whether the effects reported above are related to local changes of stimuli features, i.e., the orientation differences of the circle elements between the contour and noncontour trials, we did the following. We presented the contour and noncontour stimuli to a third, naive monkey that was trained on fixation alone (without contour detection/reporting). Figure S3 shows no significant difference between the two stimuli, in the circle or background areas (Figures S3A, S3B, and S3D) or in the FG-m (Figure S3C). This further suggests that circle/background segregation is not directly related to stimulus differences in orientation but rather to a perceptual figure-ground process. Both monkeys showed enhancement in the circle area and suppression in the background area, but to different levels. Whereas monkey L showed a large suppression in the background area and small response enhancement in the circle area, monkey S showed both response suppression in the background area and enhancement in the circle area. These results demonstrate that circle/background segregation by population response can be achieved by different levels of enhancement in the circle area and suppression in the background area. The exact neural code for each animal may relate to its strategy for solving the task. Finally, we note that the above spatiotemporal patterns cannot result from microsaccades as they were verified in trials lacking microsaccades. Can the population response in the circle and background be informative at the single-trial level? Figures 4A–4D depicts population-response maps (top panels) computed in the late phase, for two example contour trials and two example noncontour trials. Importantly, the maps of the single trials show a clear difference between the circle and background areas occurring only in the contour condition. To quantify this, we plotted the distribution histograms of the pixels’ responses in the circle and background areas (Figures 4A–4D, lower-left panels). This was done separately for the contour and noncontour single trials. We then used these distributions to compute the ROC curve for each trial (Figures 4A–4D, lower-right panels). The area under the curve (AUC) is 0.94 and 0.92 for each contour trial. This means a high separation based on the population response in the late phase, between the circle and background pixels in the contour condition. The AUC values were 0.49 and 0.50 for the two noncontour trials. This means no response amplitude difference between the circle and background pixels in the noncontour condition. Based on this, we defined figure-ground measure for single trials (FG trials): Pc-Pb, i.e., subtracting the population response of the background (Pb) from the population response of the circle (Pc) in each contour and noncontour single trial. Figure 4E shows the distribution histograms of the FG trials for all contour and noncontour trials in a typical recording session. The distribution histogram shows a significant difference between the contour and noncontour trials (p < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test). Figure 4F shows the ROC analysis and the AUC is 0.92, indicating a high separation between single trials belonging to the contour and noncontour condition based on FG trials. This AUC value was much higher than the shuffled AUC that was calculated from 100 iterations of randomly shuffled contour and noncontour trials (AUC, 0.5 ± 0.11, mean ± 3 × SD; Figure 4F, dashed gray lines). We then performed an ROC analysis on the FG trials, for each recording session and found the AUC to be 0.92 ± 0.014 (mean ± SEM; n = 15 recording sessions; significantly different from 0.5, p < 0.001) and 0.81 ± 0.023 (mean ± SEM; n = 10 recording sessions; significantly different from 0.5, p < 0.01) for monkeys L and S, respectively. In contrast to the late phase, the AUC in the early phase was much smaller: 0.63 ± 0.035 and 0.63 ± 0.017 for monkeys L and S, respectively. Our results indicate that the response difference between the circle and background area, only in the late phase, can be useful for making a behavioral decision at the single-trial level. Finally, we wanted to study the relation between the population response, contour saliency, and the perceptual report. For this purpose, the monkeys performed a contour-detection task when presented with contours at various saliency levels. We varied the contour saliency by increasing the orientation jitter of the contour elements (see Experimental Procedures; Figure 5A). For each orientation jitter, we measured the behavioral and neuronal responses, i.e., the contour-detection probability and the population response (see Experimental Procedures). Next, the psychometric curve was computed (the contour-detection probability for each orientation jitter) and the results were fitted with a Weibull function (Figures 5B and S4A). Both monkeys showed similar normalized psychometric curves where, as expected, increasing the orientation jitter (decreasing the saliency of the contour) decreased the probability of contour detection. The neurometric curve was then calculated by computing the FG-m for each orientation jitter condition, in the late phase (see Experimental Procedures; Figures 5C and S4B): FG-mjitt = (Pc-Pb)jitt − (Pc-Pb)non-cont where Pc and Pb are the population responses in the circle and background areas, respectively, and jitt and non-cont are the different jitter conditions and noncontour condition, respectively (the contour condition is defined by jitter = 0). This curve was then fitted with a Weibull function. The normalized neurometric curve showed a high similarity to the psychometric curve (r = 0.87 and 0.93 p < 0.01, for monkeys L and S, respectively). These results further support the notion that the population-response difference between circle and background can be useful for making a behavioral decision. Figure 5D displays the normalized population response as a function of orientation jitter in the background area (left; monkey L; n = 9 recording sessions) and in the circle area (right; monkey S; n = 5 recording sessions). The population response in the background is minimal for the contour condition (jitter = 0), and it increases with orientation jitter; i.e., the background suppression is decreasing with jitter (Figure 5D, left). The population response in the circle is maximal in the contour condition (jitter = 0), and it decreases with the orientation jitter; i.e., the enhancement in the circle is decreasing with the jitter (Figure 5D, right). Monkey L displayed a strong and significant negative correlation with the psychophysical performance in the background area (r = −0.74; p = 0.02); however, the correlation in the circle area was small and positive but not significant (r = 0.14; p = 0.72). Monkey S displayed a strong positive and significant correlation with the psychometric curve in the circle area (r = 0.81; p = 0.03) but a nonsignificant negative correlation in the background area (r = −0.49; p = 0.32). These results can suggest that the monkeys were displaying different approaches of brain activity to process contour integration and then to segregate the contour from the noisy background. In other words, the monkeys may have used different weights for the circle and background areas in order to detect the contour from the noisy background. Although the correlation between contour saliency and neurometric curve is informative, the relation to the monkey’s perceptual report is still unclear. To study this, we compared the FG-mjitt for orientation jitter trials, where the monkey was reporting either contour or noncontour with high probabilities. Because the stimulus remained the same and the report varied, it allowed us to test whether the observed modulations in V1 are linked to the monkeys’ perceptual report. Figure 6A displays the FG-mjitt as a function of time for two examples of orientation jitter conditions (±15 degrees in monkey L and ±10 degrees in monkey S). For both cases, the FG-mjitt in contour reported trials was higher in the late phase compared to the noncontour reported trials. This was true over multiple imaging sessions in both animals (Figure 6B. n = 6 and 9 orientation jitter conditions in which contour detection was 25%–75% in monkeys L and S, respectively; p < 0.05, paired sign ranked test). This result suggests that figure-ground modulation in V1 is at least partially linked to the perceptual reports of the monkey (see Discussion). The results above suggested that the figure-ground measure can be related to contour perception; however, the exact spatial relation, at the pixel level, is not clear. We therefore wanted to investigate the relationship between the monkey’s report and each pixel response in the imaged area. To do this, we computed the correlation between each pixel’s population response for each orientation jitter (rather than circle and background differences) and the psychometric curve. The resulting maps show the pixel-psychometric correlation. Figure 7A shows that the pixels’ responses in the circle area were positively correlated with the contour-detection performance, whereas the pixels’ responses in the background area were negatively correlated with the contour detection. It is possible that the population response is affected directly by the orientation changes of the circle elements in the jittering conditions; however, there are few arguments against this notion. First, although the contour’s elements were changed in the different jitters, the background elements were kept identical across all jitters. Nevertheless, the suppression in the background increased with contour saliency and also with animals’ contour-detection report. Namely, the population response in the background varied with the animal report in the absence of stimulus changes in the background. Second, the spatial map of correlation between the pixel response and the behavioral performance (Figure 7A) enables to observe all the pixels in the imaged area. As one can see from the map, the correlation extends beyond the retinotopic representation of individual Gabors comprising the circle or background in V1. This is different from what one would have expected from “pure” stimulus preference. In fact, the correlation maps show a rather homogeneous distribution of positive correlation in the circle area and negative correlation in the background area. The correlation extends over the “whole” circle and background areas, thus resulting in the impression that the entire imaged contour representation is positively correlated with behavior and that the entire imaged background representation is negatively correlated with behavior. In addition the correlation dynamics (Figure 7C) shows relatively late onset, peaking at the late phase. It was previously shown that responses to orientation in V1 appear much earlier in time, and specifically orientation maps in the VSD signal emerge much earlier in time (Sharon and Grinvald, 2002Sharon D. Grinvald A. Dynamics and constancy in cortical spatiotemporal patterns of orientation processing.Science. 2002; 295: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These observations do not fit well with responses to stimulus preference alone. Finally, when presenting a naive animal with a contour embedded in a noisy background, the population response does not show similar patterns: an increased activity in the contour and decreased activity in the background (Figure S3). We therefore believe that the increased activity in the circle and decreased activity in the background does not emerge from stimulus features alone. This further suggests that the correlation between pixel’s population response and psychometric curve does not emerge solely from changes in the stimulus features (i.e., jittering the orientation of the contour elements). The distribution histogram of the pixel-psychometric correlation in the circle and background areas are shown in Figure 7B. The d′"
https://openalex.org/W1973308215,"Microglial activation involves Ca(2+) signaling, and numerous receptors can evoke elevation of intracellular Ca(2+). ATP released from damaged brain cells can activate ionotropic and metabotropic purinergic receptors, and act as a chemoattractant for microglia. Metabotropic P2Y receptors evoke a Ca(2+) rise through release from intracellular Ca(2+) stores and store-operated Ca(2+) entry, and some have been implicated in microglial migration. This Ca(2+) rise is expected to activate small-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) (SK) channels, if present. We previously found that SK3 (KCa2.3) and KCa3.1 (SK4/IK1) are expressed in rat microglia and contribute to LPS-mediated activation and neurotoxicity. However, neither current has been studied by elevating Ca(2+) during whole-cell recordings. We hypothesized that, rather than responding only to Ca(2+), each channel type might be coupled to different receptor-mediated pathways. Here, our objective was to determine whether the channels are differentially activated by P2Y receptors, and, if so, whether they play differing roles. We used primary rat microglia and a rat microglial cell line (MLS-9) in which riluzole robustly activates both SK3 and KCa3.1 currents. Using electrophysiological, Ca(2+) imaging and pharmacological approaches, we show selective functional coupling of KCa3.1 to UTP-mediated P2Y2 receptor activation. KCa3.1 current is activated by Ca(2+) entry through Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC/Orai1) channels, and both CRAC/Orai1 and KCa3.1 channels facilitate refilling of Ca(2+) stores. The Ca(2+) dependence of KCa3.1 channel activation was skewed to abnormally high concentrations, and we present evidence for a close physical association of the two channel types. Finally, migration of primary rat microglia was stimulated by UTP and inhibited by blocking either KCa3.1 or CRAC/Orai1 channels. This is the first report of selective coupling of one type of SK channel to purinergic stimulation of microglia, transactivation of KCa3.1 channels by CRAC/Orai1, and coordinated roles for both channels in store refilling, Ca(2+) signaling and microglial migration."
https://openalex.org/W1985901004,"As a tumor suppressor protein, the inhibitor of growth 4 (ING4) has an important role in many cellular processes including cell cycle progression, proliferation, apoptosis, DNA damage response, tumor angiogenesis and contact inhibition. Here, we report that ING4 functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce nuclear factor-κB (NFκB)/p65 degradation. The plant homeodomain finger of ING4 interacted with p65 to undergo robust ubiquitination and degradation. ING4 bound to p65 and delivered the Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin to Lys-62 residue of p65, leading to ubiquitination of p65 and degradation. Lys-62 residue of p65 was required for ING4-mediated ubiquitination of p65 and degradation. Further analysis shows that C239 of ING4 was critical for ING4-induced p65 degradation. These findings demonstrate that ING4 acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to induce ubiquitination of p65 and degradation, which is critical to terminate NFκB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2086855876,"N-linked glycosylation in archaea has generally been assumed to follow the logic determined for bacterial and eukaryotic pathways. Biochemical investigations of the process in Methanococcus voltae now allow the functional assignment of three enzymes that generate and use an unusual monophosphate intermediate, drawing distinctions between domains of life. Asparagine-linked glycosylation is a complex protein modification conserved among all three domains of life. Herein we report the in vitro analysis of N-linked glycosylation from the methanogenic archaeon Methanococcus voltae. Using a suite of synthetic and semisynthetic substrates, we show that AglK initiates N-linked glycosylation in M. voltae through the formation of α-linked dolichyl monophosphate N-acetylglucosamine, which contrasts with the polyprenyl diphosphate intermediates that feature in both eukaryotes and bacteria. Notably, AglK has high sequence homology to dolichyl phosphate β-glucosyltransferases, including Alg5 in eukaryotes, suggesting a common evolutionary origin. The combined action of the first two enzymes, AglK and AglC, afforded an α-linked dolichyl monophosphate glycan that serves as a competent substrate for the archaeal oligosaccharyl transferase AglB. These studies provide what is to our knowledge the first biochemical evidence revealing that, despite the apparent similarity of the overall pathways, there are actually two general strategies to achieve N-linked glycoproteins across the domains of life."
https://openalex.org/W2167702433,"We analyzed a 16-year (1996-2011) time series of catch and effort data for 23 species with mean weights ranging from 0.8 kg to 224 kg, recorded by observers in the Hawaii-based deep-set longline fishery. Over this time period, domestic fishing effort, as numbers of hooks set in the core Hawaii-based fishing ground, has increased fourfold. The standardized aggregated annual catch rate for 9 small (<15 kg) species increased about 25% while for 14 large species (>15 kg) it decreased about 50% over the 16-year period. A size-based ecosystem model for the subtropical Pacific captures this pattern well as a response to increased fishing effort. Further, the model projects a decline in the abundance of fishes larger than 15 kg results in an increase in abundance of animals from 0.1 to 15 kg but with minimal subsequent cascade to sizes smaller than 0.1 kg. These results suggest that size-based predation plays a key role in structuring the subtropical ecosystem. These changes in ecosystem size structure show up in the fishery in various ways. The non-commercial species lancetfish (mean weight 7 kg) has now surpassed the target species, bigeye tuna, as the species with the highest annual catch rate. Based on the increase in snake mackerel (mean weight 0.8 kg) and lancetfish catches, the discards in the fishery are estimated to have increased from 30 to 40% of the total catch."
https://openalex.org/W2046531342,"Endometriosis, defined as the presence of endometrium outside the uterus, is one of the most frequent gynecological diseases. It has been suggested that modifications of both endometrial and peritoneal factors could be implicated in this disease. Endometriosis is a multifactorial disease in which angiogenesis and proteolysis are dysregulated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate the protein expression and may be the main regulators of angiogenesis. Our hypothesis is that peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis could modify the expression of several miRNAs that regulate angiogenesis and proteolysis in the endometriosis development. The objective of this study has been to evaluate the influence of endometriotic peritoneal fluid on the expression of six miRNAs related to angiogenesis, as well as several angiogenic and proteolytic factors in endometrial and endometriotic cell cultures from women with endometriosis compared with women without endometriosis.Endometrial and endometriotic cells were cultured and treated with endometriotic and control peritoneal fluid pools. We have studied the expression of six miRNAs (miR-16, -17-5p, -20a, -125a, -221, and -222) by RT-PCR and protein and mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A, thrombospondin-1, urokinase plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 by ELISA and qRT-PCR respectively.Control and endometriotic peritoneal fluid pools induced a significant reduction of all miRNAs levels in endometrial and endometriotic cell cultures. Moreover, both peritoneal fluids induced a significant increase in VEGF-A, uPA and PAI-1 protein levels in all cell cultures without significant increase in mRNA levels. Endometrial cell cultures from patients treated with endometriotic peritoneal fluid showed lower expression of miRNAs and higher expression of VEGF-A protein levels than cultures from controls. In conclusion , this ""in vitro"" study indicates that peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis modulates the expression of miRNAs that could contribute to the angiogenic and proteolytic disequilibrium observed in this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2090323295,"In this study, the authors identify the ER-localized protein Meigo as a modulator of dendritic and axonal targeting of olfactory neurons. They find that Meigo is essential for maintaining protein levels and N-glycosylation of Ephrin in the ER, thereby regulating its function in axonal and dendritic refinement. Neural circuit assembly requires precise dendrite and axon targeting. We identified an evolutionarily conserved endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein, Meigo, from a mosaic genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster. Meigo was cell-autonomously required in olfactory receptor neurons and projection neurons to target their axons and dendrites to the lateral antennal lobe and to refine projection neuron dendrites into individual glomeruli. Loss of Meigo induced an unfolded protein response and reduced the amount of neuronal cell surface proteins, including Ephrin. Ephrin overexpression specifically suppressed the projection neuron dendrite refinement defect present in meigo mutant flies, and ephrin knockdown caused a similar projection neuron dendrite refinement defect. Meigo positively regulated the level of Ephrin N-glycosylation, which was required for its optimal function in vivo. Thus, Meigo, an ER-resident protein, governs neuronal targeting specificity by regulating ER folding capacity and protein N-glycosylation. Furthermore, Ephrin appears to be an important substrate that mediates Meigo's function in refinement of glomerular targeting."

https://openalex.org/W2154472714,"The Peruvian scallop (Argopecten purpuratus) has been introduced to China and has successfully been hybridized with the bay scallop (A. irradians irradians). The F1 hybrids of these two scallops exhibited a large increase in production traits and some other interesting new characteristics. To understand the genetic basis of this heterosis, nuclear gene and partial mtDNA sequences, and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) were employed to analyze the genomic organization of the hybrids. Amplification of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) showed that the parental ITS sequences were present in all the hybrid individuals, illustrating that the hybrid offspring inherited nuclear DNA from both parents. Sequence analyses of the ITS region further confirmed that the hybrids harbored alleles from their parents; some recombinant variants were also detected, which revealed some alterations in the nuclear genetic material of the hybrids. The analysis of mitochondrial 16S rDNA showed that the hybrids possessed sequences that were identical to the 16S rDNA of the female parents, proving a matrilineal inheritance of mitochondrial genes in scallops. In addition, GISH clearly discriminated between the parental chromosomes and indicated a combination of haploid genomes of duplex parents in the hybrids. The genetic analyses in our study illustrated that the F1 hybrids inherited nuclear material from both parents and cytoplasmic genetic material maternally, and some variations occurred in the genome, which might contribute to a further understanding of crossbreeding and heterosis in scallop species."
