https://openalex.org/W4254038279,"RNA interference (RNAi) is the process by which double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) directs sequence-specific degradation of messenger RNA in animal and plant cells. In mammalian cells, RNAi can be triggered by 21-nucleotide duplexes of small interfering RNA (siRNA). Here we describe inhibition of early and late steps of HIV-1 replication in human cell lines and primary lymphocytes by siRNAs targeted to various regions of the HIV-1 genome. We demonstrate that synthetic siRNA duplexes or plasmid-derived siRNAs inhibit HIV-1 infection by specifically degrading genomic HIV-1 RNA, thereby preventing formation of viral complementary-DNA intermediates. These results demonstrate the utility of RNAi for modulating the HIV replication cycle and provide evidence that genomic HIV-1 RNA, as it exists within a nucleoprotein reverse-transcription complex, is amenable to siRNA-mediated degradation."

In several proteobacteria, this process involves ISC (Fe-S cluster assembly) machinery composed of at least six components also conserved in mitochondria from lower to higher eukaryotes. In nitrogen-fixing bacteria, another system, termed NIF (nitrogen fixation), is required for the maturation of nitrogenase. Here we report the identification of a third system, designated the SUF machinery, the components of which are encoded in Escherichia coli by an unassigned operon, sufABCDSE. We have analyzed spontaneous pseudorevertants isolated from a mutant strain lacking all the components of the ISC machinery. The suppressor mutations in the revertants have been localized to the regulatory region of the suf operon; overexpression of this operon restores the growth phenotypes and activity of Fe-S proteins in mutant cells lacking ISC. Disruption of the suf operon alone does not cause any major defects, but synthetic lethality was observed when both the isc and suf operons were inactivated. These results indicate that proteins encoded by the sufoperon participate in the ISC-independent minor pathway for the assembly of Fe-S clusters. The genes homologous to sufBCare present in a wide range of bacteria, Archaea, and plastids, suggesting that this type of system is almost ubiquitous in nature.

Holm R.H. Münck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). The complex mechanism by which Fe-S clusters are assembled is now becoming elucidated by genetic and biochemical methods, which led to the identification of two distinct systems, termed NIF (nitrogen fixation) and ISC (iron-sulfur cluster). In a pioneering report, Dean's group demonstrated the roles of twonif gene products in the assembly of Fe-S clusters in the nitrogenase proteins in Azotobacter vinelandii (2Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C. Laird N.F. Newton W.E. Dean D.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). NifS is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent cysteine desulfurase that initiates Fe-S cluster formation by producing elemental sulfur from cysteine (3Zheng L. White R.H. Cash V.L. Jack R.F. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). NifU appears to serve as a scaffold for the assembly of transient Fe-S clusters before delivery to other apoFe-S proteins (4Yuvaniyama P. Agar J.N. Cash V.L. Johnson M.K. Dean D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In contrast to the NIF machinery that specifically deals with the maturation of nitrogenase, the ISC machinery is involved in the general pathway of biosynthesis of numerous Fe-S proteins (5Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments support a crucial role for the proteins encoded by the so-called isc operon (iscSUA-hscBA-fdx), because the mutations in these genes in Escherichia coli decrease the activity of many Fe-S proteins (6Takahashi Y. Nakamura M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 917-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 7Schwartz C.J. Djaman O. Imlay J.A. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several similarities have been identified between the ISC and NIF systems. First, IscS bears similarity to NifS in its sequence and function as a cysteine desulfurase (5Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 9Flint D.H. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Second, IscU corresponds to the N-terminal domain of NifU and contains three conserved cysteine residues that are essential for its function as a scaffold for intermediate Fe-S clusters (11Garland S.A. Hoff K. Vickery L.E. Culotta V.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 12Agar J.N. Krebs C. Frazzon J. Huynh B.H. Dean D.R. Johnson M.K.

U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5948-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Third, IscA is closely related to its NIF counterpart (NifIscA), both of which were shown to acquire a labile Fe-S cluster and have been proposed as an alternative scaffold in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis (16Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Mattioli T. Takahashi Y. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22604-22607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 17Krebs C. Agar J.N. Smith A.D. Frazzon J. Dean D.R.

Chem. 2002; 7: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The ISC machinery contains at least three additional components, HscB, HscA, and Fdx, which appear to take part in a series of reactions that have yet to be fully characterized (19Silberg J.J. Hoff K.G. Tapley T.L. Vickery L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1696-1700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Kakuta Y. Horio T. Takahashi Y. Fukuyama K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11007-11012Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Tokumoto U. Nomura S. Minami Y. Mihara H. Kato S. Kurihara T. Esaki N. Kanazawa H. Matsubara H. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Homologous components of the NIF machinery are found in several nitrogen-fixing bacteria as well as non-diazotrophic ε-proteobacteria including Helicobacter pylori (22Olson J.W. Agar J.N. Johnson M.K. Maier R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16213-16219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the components of the ISC machinery are conserved from bacteria to higher eukaryotes, although a complete set of the components appears to be confined to α-, β-, and γ-proteobacteria and mitochondria (23Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, some Archaea such as Methanococcus jannashiiand Thermoplasma acidophilum lack all the homologous components, despite the fact that they possess genes encoding many proteins that require Fe-S clusters for proper function. Thus, our understanding of the mechanism by which Fe-S clusters are assembled is limited. In an earlier study, we described an E. coli mutant, YT1014, in which the entire isc operon has been deleted (8Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The mutant grows very poorly and exhibits a marked decrease in the activity of Fe-S proteins, 2∼10% when compared with wild-type cells. Thus, the ISC machinery serves a predominant function in the biosynthesis of Fe-S proteins. On the other hand, the residual modest activity of Fe-S enzymes raises interesting questions regarding the existence of alternative assembly machinery. In the present study, we isolated several pseudorevertants from YT1014 and analyzed the suppression mutations with respect to the expression of the sufABCDSEoperon. Although suf-encoded proteins have been proposed to be involved in S, Se, Fe or Fe-S metabolism and the oxidative stress response (the name was given after mobilization ofsulfur), there has been no direct evidence for the function of any specific proteins (24Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3307-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T. Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). We show functional redundancy between the isc and suf operons by mutational experiments, in which five suf genes are essential for viability in the mutant background of the iscoperon. From these observations, we propose that the proteins encoded by the suf operon work in concert in a novel system that mediates the biogenesis of Fe-S proteins. We also show thatsuf homologs are present in a wide range of bacteria, Archaea, and plastids. E. coli strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in the supplementary data (Table SI). Luria-Bertani (LB) medium was used as the standard medium. When required, kanamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and gentamycin were added at concentrations of 20, 5, 20, and 2 μg/ml, respectively. Spontaneous nicotinate-independent pseudorevertants were isolated from YT1014 cells by spreading them on M9 minimal plates supplemented with glucose (20 mm), thiamine (1 μg/ml), and vitamin-free casein hydrolysate (0.1%). Oligonucleotides used in this study are listed in supplementary data (Table SII). Genomic DNA was isolated from the pseudorevertant YT2001, partially digested withSau3AI, and the termini partially filled in with dATP and dGTP. The fragments were ligated into the SalI site of pUC119, which had been partially filled in with dCTP and dTTP and then introduced into YT1014 cells. The plasmid pU628 was isolated from a transformant growing on minimal media in the absence of nicotinic acid. The plasmid was re-introduced into YT1014 cells to confirm the ability to suppress the growth defect. Genomic DNA fragments corresponding to the −983 to +32 nt relative to the sufA start codon were amplified by PCR using the primers SufUF and SufUR1, and their sequences were determined by primer walking. The sufABCDSE-ynhG gene cluster and the truncated fragments were amplified by PCR using primer sets containingXhoI and NheI restriction sites and cloned into the XhoI/NheI sites of pRKNSE (29Nakamura M. Saeki K. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 10-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A sufABCDSE deletion strain, YT2512, was constructed by replacing the entire operon with a Gmr cassette. For this purpose, the 975-bp fragment corresponding to the 5′ upstream region of sufA(sufA-5′) and the 1015-bp fragment in the 3′ downstream region of sufE (sufE-3′) were amplified by PCR using the SufUF/SufUR2 and YnhGF/YnhGR2 primer sets, respectively. The Gmr cassette was amplified from pUCGM (30Schweizer H.P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 831-834PubMed Google Scholar) using the primers GmrF and GmrR. The PCR products were initially cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen), and the sequences were confirmed. The three PCR products were then cloned together into theBamHI site of pKO3 (31Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) using the compatible cohesive ends,XbaI/NheI and XhoI/SalI. The resulting construct (pKO3-Δsuf) prepared from Gmrtransformants had asufA-5′/Gmr/sufE-3′ insertion, as confirmed by digestion with several restriction enzymes. The plasmid was introduced into E. coli MG1655 and selected for chromosomal integration and excision as previously described (8Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,31Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Monitoring the growth in minimal and LB media and determining the activity of succinate dehydrogenase were performed as described previously (8Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The wild-type (MG1655) cells grow with a doubling time of 22.8 ± 0.8 min in LB medium at 37 °C, which corresponds to the growth rate of 1.82 ± 0.06 h−1. The value for succinate dehydrogenase activity determined in MG1655 cell extract was 37.7 ± 8.6 nmol of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2,4-tetrazolium bromide reduced/mg of protein/min. E. coli YT1014 has a defined deletion of the isc operon (ΔiscRSUA- hscBA-fdx-ORF3::Kmr) and lacks all the components of the ISC machinery. The mutant shows auxotrophy toward nicotinic acid, thiamine, methionine, isoleucine, and valine, exhibiting very poor growth on rich medium even when these compounds are supplied. This phenotype has been attributed primarily to a defect in the assembly of Fe-S clusters because the activities of Fe-S enzymes are decreased markedly in the mutant cells (8Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To identify alternative systems mediating Fe-S cluster assembly that may contribute to the modest amount of the residual Fe-S protein activity, spontaneous pseudorevertants of YT1014 were isolated. Such revertants appeared on minimal medium lacking nicotinic acid at a frequency of 10−7–10−6. Five independent revertants (YT2001, YT2002, YT2003, YT2006, and YT2007) were chosen for further study. Their growth rate in liquid LB medium was about 2∼3 times slower than wild-type cells but significantly faster than the parental YT1014 cells (Fig. 1 A). Activity measurement of succinate dehydrogenase, an Fe-S enzyme, showed that the enzyme level also lies between those found in wild-type and YT1014 cells. In addition, auxotrophy toward nicotinic acid, thiamine, methionine, isoleucine, and valine were partially relieved in the revertants (data not shown), indicating that activities of various Fe-S proteins were restored. Because the iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx-ORF3 allele in YT1014 is a nonreverting null mutation, the revertants must result from extragenic suppressor mutations. In an attempt to clone the gene conferring the pseudorevertant phenotype, we made a genomic library from YT2001 and isolated a plasmid selected for its ability to complement the nicotinate auxotrophy and slow growth phenotype of YT1014. Sequencing of the obtained plasmid pU628 revealed a 788-bp chimeric DNA fragment composed of truncated IS2 (459 bp) and incomplete sufA (127 and 202 bp for upstream and coding regions, respectively). The results were surprising because: 1) the transposable element IS2 is not located in the corresponding region of MG1655 sequence; 2) both IS2 and sufA are truncated; and 3) only a few transformants gave a revertant phenotype, at a frequency of 10−3–10−2, when pU628 was re-introduced into YT1014 cells. Thus, we analyzed the 5′ upstream region of chromosomal sufA (−983 to +32 nt relative to thesufA start codon) by PCR and found that a 2.3-kb fragment was amplified from the YT2001 allele rather than the 1.0-kb fragment amplified from wild-type and YT1014 cells (Fig. 1 B). The 2.3-kb fragment was used as a template for direct sequencing, which revealed the complete 1331-bp IS2 sequence containing 41-bp imperfect inverted terminal repeats. Duplication of 5-bp direct repeats in the target DNA (CTATG; −123 to −127 nt relative to the sufAstart codon) clearly indicates that IS2 was transposed and inserted into the upstream region of sufA in YT2001. Next, the corresponding region was analyzed in YT1014 cells transformed with the pU628 plasmid. From the slow growing cells, a 1.0-kb fragment was amplified by PCR, similar to that observed for wild-type and YT1014, whereas an additional 4.9-kb fragment was amplified from the fast growing cells (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). Partial sequencing of the purified 4.9-kb fragment revealed the junction between pUC119 and truncated IS2 or sufA. Thus, the plasmid pU628 (3950 bp) is most likely integrated into the chromosomalsufA region via a single crossover homologous recombination, which may be responsible for the pseudorevertant phenotype. PCR and DNA sequence analysis were carried out on the 5′ upstream region of sufA from 5 pseudorevertants, resulting in identification of the following distinct mutations: 1) transposition of IS2 at position −128 relative to the sufA start codon in YT2001; 2) transposition of IS1 at position −181 in YT2006; 3) C to T base substitution at position −149 in YT2002; 4) insertion of A at position −51 in YT2003; and 5) insertion of T at position −51 in YT2007 (Fig. 1 C). All of the mutations lie in the non-coding region and, in fact, are confined between a putative ρ-independent terminator and the sufA start codon. In this region of DNA, no base differences were observed for YT1014 or MG1655. ThesufA gene transcript begins 32 nt upstream of thesufA start codon (28Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. LaRossa R.A. Storz G. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4562-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Nearly consensus −35 and −10 elements of an Eς70-dependent promoter are present upstream of the transcription start site, which overlaps with a Fur box sequence for recognition by the iron-sensing transcriptional regulator Fur (24Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3307-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Two of our mutations, insertion of A or T at position −51, disrupt the consensus sequence of the Fur box. Furthermore, these insertions alter the promoter sequence to match the consensus 17-bp spacing between the −35 and −10 elements. Improvement of the promoter was confirmed with computer programs by the Homology Score Method (32Mulligan M.E. Hawley D.K. Entriken R. McClure W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and the Neural Network Method. 2www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html. Although the original promoter sequence remains unaffected by other mutations, we found several promoter-like sequences created by the base substitution and IS transpositions (Fig. 1 C). Taken together, these data suggest that the mutations in the regulatory region may increase the expression of sufA and downstream genes in the pseudorevertants. The sufA gene is the first member of the sufABCDSE operon, located at 38 min in the E. coli MG1655 genome (Fig.2 A). The sufS gene product is a paralog of IscS and catalyzes elimination of sulfur froml-cysteine and selenium from l-selenocysteine (10Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 25Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T. Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although gene products of the remaining five sufgenes were not characterized, SufA is 47% identical to IscA and SufC shows homology to ATPase subunits of ABC transporters (24Patzer S.I. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3307-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Nachin L. El Hassouni M. Loiseau L. Expert D. Barras F. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 960-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Ellis K.E. Clough B. Saldanha J.W. Wilson R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the suggestion thatsuf-encoded proteins are involved in S, Se, Fe, or Fe-S cluster metabolism, although no direct evidence for its functional role has been attained. To determine if increased expression of thesuf operon could be responsible for the phenotypes of our isolates, the operon, without the promoter, was amplified by PCR, cloned into a low copy number vector under the control of thelac promoter, and introduced into YT1014, which resulted in marked restoration of both growth rate and succinate dehydrogenase activity (Fig. 2 B). Several genes in the sufoperon were required for the restoration, whereas the downstream geneynhG was not. The auxotrophy of YT1014 toward nicotinic acid, thiamine, and several amino acids was also reversed by expression of multiple copies of the suf operon (data not shown). The growth phenotypes of the transformants were not affected by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, indicating that basal expression from the uninduced lac promoter is sufficient for the complementation. When the operon was cloned into a high copy number vector, pUC119, it provided no complementation of YT1014 and rather had an inhibitory effect on growth. Hence, excessive expression of the suf operon appears toxic, which explains why we could not clone the entire operon in the initial screening from the revertant library. The possibility of redundant roles between isc andsuf has been investigated by inactivating the corresponding operons, either singly or in combination. The sufABCDSEoperon was deleted by substituting the entire coding region with a Gmr cassette. A temperature-sensitive replicon and thesacB marker were exploited to cointegrate a pKO3-derived plasmid carrying a disrupted suf operon into chromosomal DNA by homologous recombination, then to excise the plasmid, leaving a disrupted chromosomal allele. The resulting strain YT2512 (ΔsufABCDSE::Gmr), which was confirmed by PCR and Southern blotting, grew as well as the parental MG1655 in rich and minimal media. Despite the absence of the entiresuf operon, succinate dehydrogenase activity was not obviously affected (data not shown). In contrast, when the deletion plasmid was introduced into YT1014 or YT1034 (ΔiscSUA::Kmr) cells (8Tokumoto U. Takahashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), cointegrates that formed after plasmid insertion into chromosome could not be resolved. Growth of mucoid colonies on sucrose plates and a failure to lose chloramphenicol resistance provided by pKO3 were indicative of merodiploidy (pseudodisruptant) (31Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), suggesting that thesuf operon may be essential for viability in the mutant background of the isc operon. The synthetic lethality was examined further by introducing theΔiscSUA::Kmr mutation into YT2512 (ΔsufABCDSE::Gmr). As shown in Fig.2 C, we obtained the double mutant when the recipient cells carried the suf-containing plasmid pRKSUF017 but not in control cells without the plasmid. To determine which sufgene is essential for growth, we modified pRKSUF017 such that genes were inactivated independently by truncation or by introducing translational stop codons (Fig. 2 A). The results of a secondΔiscSUA::Kmr mutagenesis indicate that all suf genes but one (sufD) are indispensable (Fig. 2 C). Although viable, cells in which sufD was inactivated displayed a severe growth defect in the mutant background of ΔiscSUA; the strain grew very slowly in LB medium with a doubling time of about 230 min and reached a lower final growth level than the ΔiscSUA cells (about one-fifth, as measured by A 660). ThesufD − ΔiscSUA cells were unable to grow on minimal media, even when nicotinic acid, thiamine, and casamino acids were supplemented. These results taken together provide additional evidence for the functional redundancy between theisc and suf operons. Most probably, the six proteins encoded by the suf operon work in concert as the components of a novel apparatus (here termed the SUF machinery), which participates in the maturation of Fe-S proteins. A recent microarray expression analysis has shown that suf operon is regulated by OxyR and induced upon treatment with hydrogen peroxide (28Zheng M. Wang X. Templeton L.J. Smulski D.R. LaRossa R.A.

Because damage to Fe-S clusters is a major consequence of oxidative stress, expression of the suf operon appears to be regulated so as to satisfy the cellular need for Fe-S cluster formation. In the data bases of completely sequenced microbial genomes, we found a number of suf-, isc-, and nif-related genes (see supplemental data, Fig. S1). Some of these genes are clustered in their respective genome sequences, probably as operons, indicating several models for the genetic organization of Fe-S cluster assembly systems. First, E. coli and its close relatives (Yersinia pestis and several Salmonella species) retain both the suf and isc operons, whereas other species possess only one of the two. This provides additional evidence for the redundant role of the SUF and ISC systems that operate in separate, parallel pathways. In A. vinelandii, the iscS and hscA genes are essential for viability (5Zheng L. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), which might be explained by the lack of the SUF machinery. Second, the ε-proteobacteria (H. pylori and Campylobacter jejuni) contain the NIF machinery similar to that observed in several nitrogen-fixing bacteria (22Olson J.W. Agar J.N. Johnson M.K. Maier R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 16213-16219Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Third, iscU is not only found in the iscoperon of proteobacteria but also in the suf-related operon of other species, including Thermotoga maritima andBacillus subtilis, suggesting that the gene originated as a component of the SUF system. Fourth, the sufBC-like genes are present in a number of species, including Archaea, suggesting that they play central roles in the SUF machinery. In eukaryotic genome sequences, sufBC-like genes are present in the plastid genomes of the red algae, including Guillardia theta andOdontella sinensis (27Ellis K.E. Clough B. Saldanha J.W. Wilson R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 33Wittpoth C. Kroth-Pancic P.G. Strotmann H. Plant Sci. 1996; 114: 171-179Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Although these genes are absent from the plastid genomes of higher plants, sufABCDSE-like genes are all encoded in the nuclear DNA of Arabidopsis thaliana, with potential transit peptides for import into chloroplasts. In conclusion, we have identified an operon encoding a novel bacterial system for the assembly of Fe-S clusters. The available evidence suggests that SUF-like systems operate also in Archaea and plastids, raising the possibility that this type of system is almost ubiquitous in nature. We thank H.

https://openalex.org/W2109962174,"The MCM2–7 complex is believed to function as the eukaryotic replicative DNA helicase. It is recruited to chromatin by the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1, and it is activated at the G1/S transition by Cdc45 and the protein kinases Cdc7 and Cdk2. Paradoxically, the number of chromatin-bound MCM complexes greatly exceeds the number of bound ORC complexes. To understand how the high MCM2–7:ORC ratio comes about, we examined the binding of these proteins to immobilized linear DNA fragments in Xenopus egg extracts. The minimum length of DNA required to recruit ORC and MCM2–7 was ∼80 bp, and the MCM2–7:ORC ratio on this fragment was ∼1:1. With longer DNA fragments, the MCM2–7:ORC ratio increased dramatically, indicating that MCM complexes normally become distributed over a large region of DNA surrounding ORC. Only a small subset of the chromatin-bound MCM2–7 complexes recruited Cdc45 at the onset of DNA replication, and unlike Cdc45, MCM2–7 was not limiting for DNA replication. However, all the chromatin-bound MCM complexes may be functional, because they were phosphorylated in a Cdc7-dependent fashion, and because they could be induced to support Cdk2-dependent Cdc45 loading. The data suggest that in Xenopus egg extracts, origins of replication contain multiple, distributed, initiation-competent MCM2–7 complexes.

The data suggest that in Xenopus egg extracts, origins of replication contain multiple, distributed, initiation-competent MCM2–7 complexes. the origin recognition complex pre-replication complex nucleoplasmic extract replication protein A In eukaryotic organisms, DNA replication initiates at many sites (1Gilbert D.M. Science. 2001; 294: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA replication initiates every ∼40 kb at autonomously replicating sequences that recruit the origin recognition complex (ORC),1 the six-subunit initiator protein. In metazoans, initiation sites are less rigidly defined. In embryonic cells of Xenopus laevis, DNA replication initiates once every ∼10 kb without sequence specificity (2Blow J.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3293-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In somatic cells, initiation events are less frequent, occurring once every ∼150 kb, and recent evidence indicates that initiations are controlled by genetic elements (1Gilbert D.M. Science. 2001; 294: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). At some loci, replication initiates at a precise location, whereas at other loci, initiation events are distributed throughout zones spanning up to 50 kb. The mechanism of DNA replication initiation is highly conserved among eukaryotic organisms (3Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 4Takisawa H. Mimura S. Kubota Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A representative model system isXenopus egg extracts (2Blow J.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3293-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 4Takisawa H. Mimura S. Kubota Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 690-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) where two factors, Cdc6 and Cdt1, bind to sites on chromatin that are marked by ORC. Subsequently, the hexameric MCM2–7 complex binds to the ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1 complex to establish the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). At the onset of DNA replication, the pre-RC is activated by the sequential action of the protein kinases Cdc7/Dbf4 and Cdk2/cyclin E (Cdk) (5Jares P. Blow J.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1528-1540PubMed Google Scholar, 6Walter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39773-39778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical experiments suggest that the function of Cdc7/Dbf4 is the phosphorylation of the MCM2–7 complex (7Sclafani R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2111-2117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After MCM phosphorylation by Cdc7/Dbf4, Cdk2/cyclin E stimulates the association of Cdc45 with the pre-RC, likely via a direct interaction with the MCM2–7 complex (8Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 9Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The binding of Cdc45 coincides with activation of a chromatin-bound helicase that unwinds the DNA, allowing binding of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein, RPA, and DNA polymerase α/primase (10Mimura S. Masuda T. Matsui T. Takisawa H. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). During replication, the MCM complex is displaced from chromatin, and its re-association is inhibited until cells pass through mitosis. In Xenopus egg extracts, re-replication is prevented by at least two inhibitors that block the re-loading of the MCM complex onto origins: geminin (12McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), which negatively regulates the MCM complex loading factor Cdt1 (13Tada S., Li, A. Maiorano D. Mechali M. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 14Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar); and Cdk2/cyclin E (15Hua X.H. Yan H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which appears to inhibit MCM2–7 loading by multiple mechanisms, one of which involves nuclear export of Cdc6 (16Pelizon C. Madine M.A. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic experiments provide strong support for the idea that the MCM2–7 complex functions as the replicative DNA helicase (reviewed in Ref. 17Labib K. Diffley J.F. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 2001; 11: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, several observations are not easily reconciled with this model. Immunofluorescence studies inXenopus egg extracts and mammalian cells show that the majority of MCM complexes do not co-localize with sites of DNA synthesis (18Dimitrova D.S. Todorov I.T. Melendy T. Gilbert D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 19Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Laskey R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10189-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Rather, the MCM complex appears to bind to unreplicated chromatin close to the site of synthesis (19Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that MCM and ORC do not co-localize on DNA fragments as large as 500–1000 bp (22Ritzi M. Baack M. Musahl C. Romanowski P. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24543-24549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Another puzzling observation concerns the number of chromatin-bound ORC and MCM complexes. In Xenopus egg extracts, the number of ORC complexes closely matches the number of initiation events, whereas the number of MCM complexes exceeds the number of initiation events by a factor of ∼10–40 (23Mahbubani H.M. Chong J.P. Chevalier S. Thommes P. Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Walter J. Newport J.W. Science. 1997; 275: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae and humans, the number of chromatin-bound MCM complexes also greatly exceeds the number of origins (25Burkhart R. Schulte D., Hu, D. Musahl C. Gohring F. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 26Donovan S. Harwood J. Drury L.S. Diffley J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5611-5616Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 27Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 28Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5081-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 29Richter A. Knippers R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Together these findings appear to give rise to an “MCM paradox” in which multiple DNA helicases are present in nuclei at sites that do not coincide with replication forks (18Dimitrova D.S. Todorov I.T. Melendy T. Gilbert D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The MCM paradox could be resolved if MCM complexes were bound in a distributed pattern along eukaryotic chromosomes, as proposed previously (19Krude T. Musahl C. Laskey R.A. Knippers R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Lucas I. Chevrier-Miller M. Sogo J.M. Hyrien O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 769-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this paper, we use Xenopus egg extracts to provide direct evidence for this idea. Moreover, our data argue that whereas most chromatin-bound MCM complexes are competent for replication initiation, only a small subset is normally used during S phase. To generate biotinylated DNA fragments, PCR was carried out with pairs of oligonucleotide primers 15–28 bp in length (exact sequences available upon request), one of which contained a biotin molecule attached to the 5′-nucleotide via a 15-atom linker arm (Operon Technologies). PCR products were generated using as a template pRS415 (6021 bp (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) that was linearized with ScaI at position 4998. To generate a 6017-bp (“6 kb”) DNA fragment, PCR primers starting at positions 4998 (biotinylated) and 5003 were used. To generate the 1006-bp (“1 kb”) DNA fragment, PCR primers starting at positions 210 and 1215 (biotinylated) were used. To generate a 251-bp (“0.25 kb”) DNA fragment spanning the polylinker, PCR primers starting at positions 3041 and 3291 (biotinylated) were used. To generate a 251-bp (0.25 kb) DNA fragment containing anEcoRI site near the biotinylated end, PCR primers starting at positions 1112 and 1362 (biotinylated) were used. To generate the 2957-bp (“3 kb”) DNA fragment used in Fig. 1, we used as a DNA template ScaI-digested pBS KS(−) and the same primers used to generate the 6-kb DNA fragment above. PCR products were purified twice using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and then coupled to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads using the Kilobasebinder kit (Dynal). Coupling reactions contained 5 μg/μl beads and ∼50 (6-kb fragments), 20 (3-kb DNA fragments), 50 (1-kb DNA fragments), or 25 ng/μl DNA (0.25-kb DNA fragments). After coupling according to the manufacturer’s instructions, beads were resuspended in ELB (250 mm sucrose, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.7) at 10 μg/μl and digested with 0.1 mg/ml P1 nuclease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 min at 37 °C to destroy single-stranded DNA. Subsequently, beads were washed three times in 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 20 mm EDTA and stored at 4 °C for up to several weeks. Coupling efficiencies ranged from ∼60 (0.25-kb DNA fragments) to ∼20% (6-kb DNA fragments). To digest immobilized DNA fragments, beads were resuspended in the appropriate restriction enzyme buffer (New England Biolabs) at 5 μg/μl. 0.5–1 units of enzyme/5 μg of beads were added, and digestion was carried out for 60 min on a rotating wheel at 37 °C. Beads were washed twice in 2 volumes of 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 20 mm EDTA, and resuspended in the same buffer at 10 μg/μl. To assess the extent of digestion, 50 μg of beads were resuspended in TBE loading dye containing 10 mm EDTA and boiled for 3 min. After snap-cooling, beads were centrifuged for 1 min at 16,000 × g. 1 μl of fresh 20 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added; the beads were resuspended, and the mixture was digested at 37 °C for 30 min. The sample was boiled again for 3 min, snap-cooled, and centrifuged, and the entire sample (including the beads) was loaded onto a 1% agarose gel (2% for DNA fragments ≤250 bp). The DNA was stained with SYBR gold (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Digestion was always verified to be ∼100% complete. To generate a series of DNA fragments 6017 (6 kb), 2824 (3 kb), 955 (1 kb), and 358 (“0.35 kb”) bp in length, the immobilized 6-kb DNA fragment was digested with buffer or HpaI, AlwNI, or BglI, respectively. To generate immobilized DNA fragments 251, 154, 120, 94, 82, 67, and 54 bp in length, the 251-bp DNA fragment spanning the polylinker of pRS415 was digested with buffer,ApaI, EcoRV, BamHI, XbaI,SacII, or AluI, respectively. To generate immobilized DNA fragments 1006 (1 kb) and 95 (“0.1 kb”) bp in length, the immobilized 1006-bp DNA fragment was digested with buffer or EcoRI. The length of the DNA fragments refers to the amount of duplex DNA. Unless stated otherwise, chromatin binding experiments were performed as follows. 100 μg of DNA beads were incubated with 10 μl of Xenopus egg cytosol containing 3 μg/ml nocodozole and an ATP regeneration system (32Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). After rotating the beads for 20 min at room temperature (21–23 °C), the extract was diluted with 60 μl of ELB supplemented with 50 mm KCl and 0.2% Triton X-100 and layered onto a 180-μl sucrose cushion (ELB + 0.25 m sucrose) in Beckman 5 × 44-mm Microfuge tubes. Samples were centrifuged horizontally for 25 s at 16,000 × g. The supernatant was removed and replaced with 200 μl of cold dilution buffer, and the sample was centrifuged in the same way. After removal of the supernatant, the beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. In some cases, egg cytosol was preincubated for 5 min with 150 nm human geminin (14Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). For chromatin binding in NPE, beads were collected with a magnet after the incubation in egg cytosol; 80% of the supernatant was removed, and it was replaced with 1 volume of NPE. After incubation in NPE for 20 min, chromatin was purified as described above. When binding to immobilized DNA fragments of different sizes was compared, it involved DNAs that had been derived from the same parent fragment by digestion. The exception is in Fig. 4A, where the 100-bp fragment was derived by digestion from a 250-bp parent fragment. In Fig. 4C, the 100-bp fragment was derived from the 1-kb fragment, but the 6-kb fragment was coupled to beads separately. The protocol for chromatin binding on demembranated sperm was the same as for DNA beads, except that the sperm was diluted with ELB containing 0.2% Triton X-100 before application to the cushion, and it was washed with ELB. DNA replication assays, egg cytosol preparation, and NPE preparation were carried out as described (32Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Western blotting was carried out using ORC2 (24Walter J. Newport J.W. Science. 1997; 275: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), MCM3 (15Hua X.H. Yan H. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), MCM7 (11Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), Cdc7 (11Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), Cdc45 (11Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and RPA (11Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) rabbit antibodies. In all cases, the 34-kDa subunit of RPA is shown. Sometimes Western blots were probed with a mixture of Cdc45 and ORC2 antibodies. Cdc6 antibodies were raised in rabbits against his-Cdc6 expressed in insect cells. Immunodepletions of MCM7 and CDC45 were carried out as described (11Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), except that Cdc45 was removed with 2 rounds of depletion. For quantitative Western blotting, protein concentrations of purified his-ORC2 (33Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.G. Nature. 1996; 379: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), his-Cdc45 (8Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and MCM3 (34Prokhorova T.A. Blow J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2491-2498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) were estimated by Coomassie Blue staining and densitometry using bovine serum albumin standards. We employ a soluble cell-free system derived from Xenopus eggs to study eukaryotic DNA replication (32Walter J. Sun L. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Demembranated sperm chromatin or plasmid DNA is incubated with a cytosolic egg extract to assemble pre-RCs containing ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, and the MCM complex. Subsequently, a highly concentrated nucleoplasmic extract (NPE) is added. Shortly after NPE addition, pre-RCs initiate replication and a single complete round of DNA replication occurs within vivo kinetics. To understand the spatial relationship on DNA between ORC and the MCM complex, we developed a system in which binding of these factors could be measured on immobilized linear DNA fragments. A 3-kb DNA fragment biotinylated at one end was generated by PCR and bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The immobilized DNA was incubated with Xenopus egg cytosol for 20 min, a treatment that did not lead to detectable degradation or ligation of the DNA (data not shown). The beads were recovered and washed gently, and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Both ORC2 and MCM3 were detected on beads containing the PCR product but not on an equivalent quantity of beads lacking DNA (Fig. 1, comparelanes 1 and 2). Geminin blocked the association of MCM3 with beads (Fig. 1, compare lanes 3 and4), demonstrating that loading was Cdt1-dependent (14Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A. Science. 2000; 290: 2309-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The characteristic increase in ORC2 binding seen in the presence of geminin on sperm chromatin (12McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) was also seen on immobilized linear DNA templates (Fig. 1, comparelanes 3 and 4). As expected, immunodepletion of Cdc6, ORC2, or Cdt1 from extracts also completely abolished MCM3 binding to DNA beads (data not shown). Together, these observations show that pre-RCs are assembled via physiological mechanisms on immobilized linear DNA templates. To test whether immobilized pre-RCs are functional, they were mixed with NPE. Addition of NPE led to the binding of Cdc45 (Fig. 1,lane 5), and binding was blocked by the Cdk2-inhibitor, p27Kip (Fig. 1, lane 6), as expected because Cdc45 binding requires Cdk2 (8Mimura S. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5699-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 9Zou L. Stillman B. Science. 1998; 280: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Therefore, pre-RCs formed on immobilized linear DNA templates can be transformed into a pre-initiation complex. Despite loading of Cdc45, immobilized DNA templates did not undergo efficient DNA replication (data not shown). However, PCR products that were not coupled to beads also failed to replicate (data not shown). Addition of caffeine did not rescue replication of linear DNA fragments (data not shown), indicating that the failure to replicate was not because of a checkpoint response induced by the presence of double-stranded DNA ends (35Costanzo V. Robertson K. Ying C.Y. Kim E. Avvedimento E. Gottesman M. Grieco D. Gautier J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 36Guo Z. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas linear molecules do not replicate in this system, when immobilized, they represent a powerful approach to investigate the mechanism of pre-RC and pre-initiation complex assembly. If MCM is distributed along the length of chromosomes, a long fragment of DNA should be required to achieve the high ratio of MCM:ORC observed on sperm chromatin (23Mahbubani H.M. Chong J.P. Chevalier S. Thommes P. Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Walter J. Newport J.W. Science. 1997; 275: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). On the other hand, if MCM complexes bind chromatin in the vicinity of ORC, the minimum length of DNA required to assemble ORC should also be sufficient to recruit many MCM complexes. To distinguish between these possibilities, we first determined the minimum amount of DNA required to recruit ORC and MCM complexes inXenopus extracts. A 250-bp PCR product spanning a multiple cloning site was coupled to beads. Equal quantities of these beads were then digested with different restriction enzymes to generate immobilized DNA fragments of 251, 154, 120, 94, and 67 bp (Fig. 2A). As seen by the absence of the parent DNA fragment in lanes 2–5 in Fig.2A, digestion by the restriction enzymes was complete. By digesting the DNA after immobilization, potential differences in coupling efficiency between DNAs that differ in length was eliminated, and we were able to examine binding to equimolar amounts of DNAs. When equal quantities of the digested beads were incubated with egg cytosol, ORC2 and MCM3 each bound to the 251-, 154-, 120-, and 94-bp DNA fragments (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4), but very little binding was seen on the 67-bp DNA fragment (Fig.2B, lane 5). Interestingly, the amount of ORC2 bound to all fragments longer than 94 bp was essentially the same, whereas the amount of MCM3 bound increased substantially (Fig.2B, lanes 1–4). Addition of geminin to the egg cytosol abolished binding of MCM3 to all the DNA fragments (Fig.2C, lanes 6–9). We next used quantitative Western blotting to examine the ratio of MCM3 and ORC2 on equal amounts of 251- and 94-bp DNA beads (Fig. 2D). This was done by analyzing DNA-bound material (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2) alongside a dilution series of a 1:1 molar ratio of purified MCM3:ORC2 (Fig. 2D, lanes 3–6). The ratio of MCM3:ORC2 on the 94-bp DNA fragment was very close to 1:1 (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 1 and5), whereas it was higher on the 250-bp DNA fragment (Fig.2D, lane 2). Therefore, on DNA fragments of 120 bp or less, only ∼1 MCM complex is recruited per ORC complex. On fragments of 154 bp and greater, it appears that more than one MCM complex is recruited (see below). To uncover possible differences in the minimum length of DNA required to load ORC and MCM2–7, we generated another fragment size of 82 bp. Both ORC2 and MCM3 loaded onto the 82-bp fragment but not onto an equivalent amount of the 67-bp fragment (Fig. 2E, compare lanes 3 and4). Therefore, ORC was able to recruit efficiently the MCM complex on an 82-bp fragment of DNA, but the MCM2–7:ORC ratio was very low. We next prepared immobilized DNA fragments that spanned a larger range of sizes. A 6-kb DNA fragment was coupled to beads and digested to generate 3-, 1-, and 0.35-kb DNA fragments. Again, digestion was ∼100% efficient (data not shown). When the binding of ORC2 and MCM3 was examined, two interesting results were observed. First, the amount of ORC2 bound did not change significantly on equivalent quantities of DNA beads where the DNA fragment size varied 18-fold from 0.35 to 6 kb (Fig.3A, lanes 1–4, bottom panel). This result suggests that the mechanisms that limit ORC binding to once every ∼10–15 kb on sperm chromatin (24Walter J. Newport J.W.

Biol. 2000; 296: 769-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) are also operative on linear DNA fragments. Second, in contrast to ORC2, MCM3 loading increased dramatically as the DNA fragment size increased (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4, top panel). These observations parallel closely what we found on the 250-bp DNA fragment and its shorter derivatives (Fig. 2B). Importantly, the MCM3:ORC2 ratio on the 6-kb DNA fragment was almost as high as that seen on sperm chromatin (Fig. 3B, comparelanes 1 and 2) where the ratio is typically ∼20–40:1 (24Walter J. Newport J.W. Science. 1997; 275: 993-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). This indicates that the mechanism of binding on immobilized DNA fragments is the same as on sperm and that it is not affected by free DNA ends.Figure 5Unlike binding of MCM2–7, chromatin binding of Cdc45 is rate-limiting for DNA replication.A, sperm chromatin (10,000/μl) was incubated with egg cytosol containing (lane 3) or lacking (lanes 1, 2, and4) geminin and then supplemented with 2 volumes of NPE containing 50 μg/ml aphidicolin (lanes 2–4) and p27Kip (lane 4 only). Immediately before (lane 1), or 20 min after the addition of NPE (lanes 2–4), sperm chromatin was isolated, and the equivalent of 10,000 sperm was analyzed on a Western blot using MCM3 antibodies (top panel) or a mixture of ORC2 and Cdc45 antibodies (bottom panel). The Western blot also contained purified proteins (lanes 5–12). Lane 5, 0.4 ng of ORC2, 0.6 ng of MCM3; lane 6, 0.4 ng of ORC2, 1.8 ng of MCM3: lane 7, 0.4 ng of ORC2, 6 ng of MCM3; lane 8, 0.4 ng of ORC2, 18 ng of MCM3; lane 9, 0.4 ng of Cdc45; lane 10, 1.2 ng of Cdc45; lane 11, 4 ng of Cdc45; lane 12, 12 ng of Cdc45. B, sperm chromatin was incubated with 6 μl of Cdc45-depleted egg cytosol and then supplemented with 12 μl of total of mock-depleted and Cdc45-depleted NPE mixed in the following ratios: 1:0 (triangles), 1:4 (circles), 1:9 (diamonds), 1:19 (squares), 0:1 (filled squares). 9 μl of each sample was mixed with [α-32P]dATP and replication measured 20, 40, 60, and 80 min after NPE addition (graph). The other 9 μl of each sample was mixed with aphidicolin, and chromatin binding of MCM, Cdc45, and RPA was measured 25 min after NPE addition. C, mock-depleted and MCM7-depleted egg cytosol were mixed in 1:0 (lane 1), 1:1 (lane 2), 1:3 (lane 3), 1:7 (lane 5), and 1:15 (lane 6) ratios and incubated with sperm chromatin (10,000/μl). Immediately before (top 3 panels) or 15 min after addition of NPE (bottom panel), sperm chromatin was isolated, and bound proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against MCM3, ORC2, or Cdc45. An aliquot of each reaction was supplemented with [α-32P]dATP and replication measured 60 min after addition of NPE (bar graph).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Binding of MCM3 to the 6-kb DNA fragment and its derivatives was completely inhibited by geminin (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–8). Similar to a previous report (12McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), geminin caused enhanced ORC2 binding, but interestingly, the degree of enhancement was directly proportional to the DNA fragment length (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–8), suggesting that geminin causes ORC to bind to many sites along the DNA. It is presently not clear whether this is due to inactivation of Cdt1 or to the absence of MCM on the chromatin. We next sought to determine whether other subunits of the MCM2–7 complex behave similarly to MCM3. To simplify the analysis, we coupled a 1-kb PCR product to beads, and we mock-digested it or digested it to a length of 100 bp. Consistent with the data in Figs. 2B and3A, the amount of ORC2 bound per DNA fragment was similar on the 100-bp and 1-kb DNA fragments (Fig. 3C, panel V, lanes 1 and 2),"

Here, we show that mice deficient in both of these proteoglycans manifest several clinical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. TheLum −/− Fmod −/− mice are smaller than their wild type littermates and display gait abnormality, joint laxity, and age-dependent osteoarthritis. Misaligned knee patella, severe knee dysmorphogenesis, and extreme tendon weakness are the likely causes for joint laxity in the double-nulls. Fibromodulin deficiency alone leads to significant reduction in tendon stiffness in theLum +/+ Fmod −/− mice, with further loss in stiffness in a Lum gene dose-dependent way. At the protein level, we show marked increase of lumican in Fmod −/− tendons, which may partially rescue the tendon phenotype in this genotype. These results establish fibromodulin as a key regulator and lumican as a modulator of tendon strength. A disproportionate increase in small diameter immature collagen fibrils and a lack of progression to mature, large diameter fibrils in the Fmod −/−background may constitute the underlying cause of tendon weakness and suggest that fibromodulin aids fibril maturation.

This study demonstrates that the collagen fibril-modifying proteoglycans, lumican and fibromodulin, are candidate genes and key players in the pathogenesis of certain types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other connective tissue disorders. Connective tissue disorders, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), 1The abbreviations used are: EDS, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome; OI, osteogenesis imperfecta; SLRP, small leucine-rich repeat proteoglycans; FDL, flexor digotorum longus; Lum , lumican; Fmod , fibromodulin; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), and the Stickler, Marfan, and Larsen syndromes display a wide spectrum of connective tissues defects. The clinical features of these disorders include hyperextensible skin; vascular defects; ocular, bowel, and bladder fragility; joint hypermobility and dislocation; musculoskeletal defects; and articular cartilage degeneration (1Byers P.H.

Clearly, the structure and organization of collagens dictate the biomechanical properties and normal functions of connective tissues (9Derwin K. Soslowsky L. J. Biomech. Eng. 1999; 121: 598-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Haut R. Lancaster R. DeCamp C. J. Biomech. 1992; 25: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 11Kronick P. Sacks M. J.

Thus, the primary defects in some of these disorders are mutations in the genes for collagens I (EDS, OI), II (Stickler), III (EDS), V (EDS), XI (Stickler) and in the genes for procollagenases (EDS) and lysyl hydroxylases (EDS), enzymes that modify collagen chains (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) (4Raff M.L. Byers P.H. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1996; 8: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although a fraction of EDS types I, II, and III are due to mutations in genes that code for collagens, the molecular defects in a large proportion of these are not known. Understandably, for decades the search for underlying molecular genetic defects has focused on the collagens and enzymes directly modifying the collagen chains (13Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 1993; 25: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 14Kuivaniemi H. Tromp G. Prockop D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2052-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). It is increasingly evident, however, that biological processes that regulate assembly or the higher order organization of the collagenous matrix are likely to contribute to these disorders. The small leucine-richrepeat proteoglycans (SLRP) have emerged as a significant multimember group, expressed at high levels in many collagenous tissues and capable of binding and regulating collagen fibril assembly and growth, likely to be important in these disorders (1Byers P.H.

Along this line, Morquio syndrome or mucopolysaccharidoses IV is associated with genetic defects in enzymes involved in the degradation of keratan sulfates, glycosaminoglycan side chains of connective tissue proteoglycans (4Raff M.L. Byers P.H. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1996; 8: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The SLRPs, lumican, fibromodulin, decorin, and biglycan, have recently become the focus of gene-targeting studies to understand their roles in connective tissue biology and disease (17Chakravarti S.

Lumican and fibromodulin are widely expressed in collagenous connective tissues and play a significant role in defining tissue integrity. Within this family, ten structurally and functionally related members are further grouped into three classes based on amino acid sequence identity, presence of cysteine-rich clusters at the N terminus and number and spacing of the leucine-rich repeats (16Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18843-18846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 23Henry S.P. Takanosu M. Boyd T.C. Mayne P.M. Eberspaecher H. Zhou W. de Crombrugghe B.

Lumican and fibromodulin, class II members, are related closely by structure; the core proteins contain N- and C-terminal cysteines and a central domain of 9–10 leucine-rich motifs that are sites of protein-protein interactions. Lumican is a component of the cornea, skin, sclera, tendon, and cartilage (17Chakravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J. Jepsen K. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J.

Rantakokko A.J. Heinegard D. Vuorio E.I. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Earlier studies of gene-targeted mice deficient in each of these proteoglycans have shown altered collagen fibril architecture in multiple connective tissues (17Chakravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J.

Lumican-deficient mice have collagen fibrils of increased diameter forming a disorganized matrix in the cornea and skin, with consequent decrease in corneal clarity and increased skin laxity (17Chakravarti S.

Oldberg, unpublished observations. In vitro lumican and fibromodulin bind to the same region on collagen type I and affect collagen fibrillogenesis, implying thatin vivo they are likely to have significant functional overlap in tissues where they are co-expressed (31Svensson L. Narlid I. Oldberg A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To investigate functional overlap(s) between lumican and fibromodulin, we developed mice jointly deficient in both proteoglycans. In an earlier study, we have shown mild, moderate, and severe alteration in collagen fibril structure of tendons in theLum −/− Fmod +/+,Lum +/+ Fmod −/−, andLum −/− Fmod −/− mice, respectively (19Ezura Y. Chakravarti S. Oldberg A. Chervoneva I. Birk D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Although the regulatory role of lumican and fibromodulin in the assembly of tendon-collagen fibrils is clearly evident from this study, the effects of the double-null mutation on tendon mechanical properties were not elucidated nor were their influence on other organs explored. In the current study, we undertook a detailed characterization of the lumican-fibromodulin double-null phenotype. Our study reveals marked joint laxity, abnormal gait, and a severe reduction in tendon stiffness in double-null adult mice. An in-depth study of tendon ultrastructure and biomechanical strength demonstrates an essential role for fibromodulin, with lumican as its modulator, in collagen fibril structure and biomechanical strength of tendons. These studies establish a fundamental role for lumican and fibromodulin in regulating collagen fibril architecture of connective tissues and modulating tissue strength. The Lum −/− mutation is maintained in an outbred CD-1 background, whereas theFmod−/− mutation was originally developed in the C57 background. We derivatized the fibromodulin-null mice from frozen embryos and crossed these for approximately ten generations to the CD-1 background. However, we were concerned that genetic background-related differences would play a role in the structure and functions of tendons. Therefore, all experiments presented here were conducted on littermates. Mice heterozygous for the lumican-null and fibromodulin-null mutations (Lum +/− Fmod +/−) were intercrossed to generate compound null mice (Lum −/− Fmod −/−). The mice were genotyped separately for Lum and Fmodby PCR, and null phenotypes were confirmed by Western blot analysis. The mechanical and morphological properties of mature flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendons were examined (being a long, single fascicle tendon, it is amenable to biomechanical testing) inLum +/+ Fmod +/+ (wild type,n = 11),Lum −/− Fmod +/+(lumican-null, n = 8),Lum +/+ Fmod −/−(fibromodulin-null, n = 4), andLum −/− Fmod −/−(lumican-fibromodulin-null, n = 9) mice. In addition, several heterozygous mice were examined, includingLum +/− Fmod +/+(n = 4),Lum +/− Fmod +/−(n = 8), andLum +/− Fmod −/−(n = 9). The sample population included males and females ranging in age from 16 to 24 weeks. Alterations in knee laxity were examined in 6-month-oldLum +/+ Fmod +/+(n = 12) andLum −/− Fmod −/−(n = 10) mice. Levels of lumican and fibromodulin messages were assessed by real-time PCR, and protein levels were assessed by semi-quantitative Western blots in FDL tendons from 2-month-old mice of the above genotypes. Mice were handled according to policies approved by the Johns Hopkins University animal care committee. To test for alterations in knee laxity, the right hind limbs were harvested from 6-month-old wild type (n = 12) and double knockout (n = 10) mice. Skin and muscle were removed from the limbs under a stereomicroscope leaving the joint capsule intact. The femur and tibia were potted in brass tubes using a quick-setting epoxy leaving the joint exposed. The limbs were placed in a custom-made loading fixture with the tibia fixed at a flexion angle of 60 degrees (32Blankevoort L. Osch G.v. Janssen B. Hekman E. J. Biomech. 1996; 29: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The knee joint was preconditioned for 30 s, by translating the tibia ±0.25 mm in the antero-posterior direction and then subjected to an antero-posterior translation of ±0.5 mm for 60 s. Joint laxity was determined by adding the tibial translations in the anterior and posterior directions when the load magnitude reached 0.5 newton from the initial load at zero deflection. This joint laxity measure represents the deflection necessary to begin engaging the resistance offered by the passive constraints of the knee (e.g. joint capsule and ligaments). FDL tendons were removed from the left hind limbs, stored in Hanks' media at 4 °C, and tested to failure in tension within 24 h of sacrifice. The distal and proximal ends of the FDL tendons were placed between sandpaper-covered plates leaving a 9-mm gauge region and fixed to a servohydraulic materials testing system (Instron Corp., Canton, MA). Samples were subjected to five preconditioning cycles by loading the tendons to 4.5% strain at 10%/s, holding for 20 s, and then unloading. Tendon stiffness equilibrated after three to four preconditioning cycles. The tendons were then loaded to failure at 10%/s. Load-deformation data were collected at 50 Hz using LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Measures of whole tendon stiffness (Table I) and maximum load (not shown) were calculated from the load-deformation curves of the failure tests. Variation in body size was corrected by regression analysis. Differences in tendon material properties were determined by taking the variation in tendon size into consideration. Tensile modulus and strength, representing tissue-level mechanical properties, independent of tendon size, were calculated by normalizing the load-deformation data by cross-sectional area and the gauge length (Table I).Table ITendon stiffness (italic) in newtons/mm (mean ± S.D.) and modulus(bold) in newtons/mm2(mean ± S.D.)GenotypeFmod +/+Fmod +/−Fmod −/−16.8 ± 1.412.6 ± 1.8ap < 0.01 values represent differences relative to Lum +/+ Fmod +/+ (analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls post-hoc test).Lum +/+998.0 ± 150.3NDcND, not done.1016.5 ± 137.9n = 11dn = number of tendons.n = 418.1 ± 1.817.3 ± 1.19.2 ± 1.5bp < 0.001 values represent differences relative to Lum+/+ Fmod+/+(analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls post-hoc test).Lum +/−1166.6 ± 145.01127.5 ± 81.5708.8 ± 164.7 bp < 0.001 values represent differences relative to Lum+/+ Fmod+/+(analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls post-hoc test).n = 4n = 8n = 916.0 ± 2.06.5 ± 2.7bp < 0.001 values represent differences relative to Lum+/+ Fmod+/+(analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls post-hoc test).Lum −/−1115.1 ± 165.8ND509.2 ± 225.7 bp < 0.001 values represent differences relative to Lum+/+ Fmod+/+(analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls post-hoc test).n = 8n = 9a p < 0.01 values represent differences relative to Lum +/+ Fmod +/+ (analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls post-hoc test).b p < 0.001 values represent differences relative to Lum+/+ Fmod+/+(analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls post-hoc test).c ND, not done.d n = number of tendons.

The transverse sections were glued to acrylic slides, polished to 1-μm diamond finish, and surface-stained with toluidine blue. The sections were digitized under transmitted light at 63× using public domain image analysis software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Area measurements were obtained for three transverse sections and averaged. Knees were dissected from Lum +/+ Fmod +/+,Lum +/+ Fmod −/−,Lum −/− Fmod +/+, andFmod −/− Lum −/− mice at 2 and 5 months of age and fixed in 95% ethanol, 1% acetic acid for 16 h at 4 °C. Samples were decalcified in 7% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 5 days prior to dehydration in increasing ethanol concentrations and embedded in Histowax (Histolab, Gothenburg, Sweden) as previously described (21Svensson L. Aszodi A. Reinholt F.P. Fassler R. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9636-9647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Sagittal serial sections, 6-μm thick, were taken every 60 μm through the tibial and femoral articular cartilage. The sections were de-paraffinized in xylene, rehydrated in ethanol, and stained with Mayer hematoxylin (Histolab, Gothenburg, Sweden), and Chromotrope 2R (Sigma Chemical Co., Gothenburg, Sweden). Five-month-old mice were sacrificed, and three to five mice were used per genotype. The hind limbs were fixed in situ in 4% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, with 8.0 mm CaCl2 for 15 min, during which time the flexor digitorum longus (FDL) tendons were dissected. The tendons were further fixed for 2 h at 4 °C and processed as previously described (19Ezura Y. Chakravarti S. Oldberg A. Chervoneva I. Birk D.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tendons were post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and stained en bloc with uranyl acetate/50% ethanol. After dehydration in an ethanol series, followed by propylene oxide, the tendons were infiltrated and embedded in a mixture of EMbed 812, nadic methyl anhydride, and DMP-30 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). Thin sections were cut using a Reichert UCT Ultramicrotome and a diamond knife and stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 3.2. Sections were taken in the mid region of the tendon and were analyzed inLum +/+ Fmod −/−,Lum −/− Fmod +/+,Lum −/− fmod −/−, andLum +/+ fmod +/+ mice using transmission electron microscopy. Sections were examined and photographed at 75 kV using an Hitachi 7000 transmission electron microscope. For each genotype, five to six different tendons from three to five animals were analyzed. Micrographs (38–54/group) from non-overlapping regions of the central portion of the tendon were taken at 31,680×. Micrographs were randomly chosen in a masked manner from the different groups and digitized, and diameters were measured using an image analysis system (RM Biometrics-Bioquant, Memphis, TN). A region from a single photographic negative, containing ∼60–290 fibrils, was measured. The frequency of different diameter fibrils was analyzed in a total of 4121 to 7960 collagen fibrils. FDL tendons isolated from 2-month-old mice were weighed and cut into small pieces. T-PER tissue extraction reagent (Pierce Technology) containing Halt protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce Technology) at a final concentration of 1× was added at 20 ml/g of tissue, and samples were homogenized on ice. Tissue debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 10,000 rpm. The supernatant was saved, and its protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce Technology). The proteoglycans were visualized by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using antibodies against lumican and fibromodulin (17Chakravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J. Jepsen K. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 21Svensson L. Aszodi A. Reinholt F.P. Fassler R. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol.

As an internal control, actin was visualized by using a polyclonal antibody (C11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Total RNA was isolated from FDL tendons of two-month old mice of genotypes as indicated in Table II, using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). Real time reverse transcript PCR was performed on ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Total RNA (100 ng) was mixed with TaqMan One-Step RT-PCR Master Mix Reagents Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), specific primers and labeled probes according to manufacturer's instructions. The primers and probes were selected by Primer Express v.3.0 (Applied Biosystems) based on the sequence from Genbank S79461 for Lumican, X94998 for Fibromodulin(FMOD) and M32599 for GAPDH(see below). The real-time RT-PCR reaction was carried out as follows: 1 cycle of 95 °C 10 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C 15 s, 60 °C 1 min with initial 48 °C 30 min for reverse transcription. The data were collected and analyzed with Sequence Detection Software 2.0 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primers used were as follows: Lum (forward primer, 5′-CTTGAAAAGTTTGATGTGAAGACCTT; reverse primer, 5′-TGCCATCCAAGCGCAGAT; probe, 5′-FAM-TCCTGGGACCACTGTCTTACTCCAAGATCAA-TAMRA), Fmod (forward primer, 5′-CAACACCAACCTGGAGAATCTTT; reverse primer, 5′-GTGCAGAAGCTGCTGATGGA; probe, 5′-FAM-CCTCCAGGGCAACAGGATCAATGAGTT-TAMRA), and Gapdh(forward primer, 5′-CCCTGGCCAAGGTCATCC; reverse primer, 5′-TGATGGCATGGACTGTGGTC; probe, 5′-VIC-CAACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGGGCTCA-TAMRA).Table IIReal-time RT-PCR measurements of relative expression of lumican (italic) and fibromodulin (boldface) compared to GAPDHFmod +/+Fmod +/−Fmod −/−Lum +/+0.087 ± 0.036 (n = 10)0.085 ± 0.034 (n = 8)0.039 ± 0.013 (n = 8)0.182 ± 0.041 (n = 11)0.150 ± 0.029 (n = 10)0.001 ± 0.000 (n = 9)Lum +/−NDaND, not done.0.022 ± 0.007 (n = 13)0.089 ± 0.040 (n = 13)ND0.269 ± 0.044 (n = 13)0.007 ± 0.002 (n = 12)Lum −/−0.003 ± 0.001 (n = 9)0 (n = 6)0 (n = 6)0.186 ± 0.051 (n = 10)0.204 ± 0.074 (n = 6)0.003 ± 0.001 (n = 6)Each value represents the mean of six to thirteen (as indicated in the table) independent measurements ± S.E.a ND, not done.

Ryu A. Waldner H. Chernova T. Manning S. Greenfield E.A. Coyle A.J. Sobel R.A. Freeman G.J. Kuchroo V.K. Nature. 2002; 415: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar) the relative expression = 2−difference Ct. Differences in mechanical and morphological properties between groups of mice were determined using a one-way analysis of variance and a Newman-Keuls post-hoc test (GraphPad Prism 3.0, San Diego, CA). Lum −/− Fmod −/−mice were obtained by intercrossing ofLum +/− Fmod +/− animals; the offspring of these matings show expected Mendelian ratios. TheLum −/− Fmod −/− mice are considerably smaller with a reduction in body weight of 23% compared withLum +/+ Fmod +/+ andLum +/− Fmod +/− mice (Fig. 1 A). TheLum −/− Fmod +/+, but not the Fmod −/− genotypes, also show a slight decrease in body size and weight. The double-knockout mice have bowed legs, exhibit severe gait abnormality, and walk on the dorsal part of the foot (Fig.1 B). Measurements of knee joint deflections show a 2-fold (p < 0.0001, t test) increase in deflection (0.64 ± 0.16 mm ofLum −/− Fmod −/−compared with 0.30 ± 0.12 mm ofLum +/+ Fmod +/+mice) providing objective measurements of the observed joint hypermobility in the double-null mouse (Fig. 1 C). Histology of the knee joints shows a severely malformed distal condyle with a medial misalignment of the patella in 65% of the double-knockout mice (Fig. 1 D). This medial patellar misalignment is probably responsible for the gait abnormality of the double-null mouse. The knee shows a secondary patellar groove and compensatory overgrowth of the metaphyseal bone to support the misaligned patella. This suggests that the knee anomaly probably begins early during growth and development. To determine if the gait anomaly and joint laxity is in part due to alterations in tendon mechanical functions, we tested the biomechanical properties of whole FDL tendons by loading to failure in tension. The different genotypes form two distinct clusters when tendon stiffness was plotted against body weight (Fig.2). TheLum +/+ Fmod +/+,Lum +/− Fmod +/+,Lum −/− Fmod +/+, andLum +/− Fmod +/− mice demonstrate a common linear relationship between whole tendon stiffness and body weight. The Fmod −/− genotypes show a different regression, indicating that for their body weight there is a marked reduction in tendon stiffness. To compare whole tendon mechanical properties, the stiffness and maximum load were normalized for differences in body weight between groups. Whole tendon stiffness (TableI) and maximum load (not shown) were unaffected in theLum −/− Fmod +/+,Lum +/− Fmod +/+, andLum +/− Fmod +/− mice. However, significant reduction in tendon stiffness (Table I) and maximum load (not shown) among the Fmod −/−genotypes (p < 0.001, ANOVA, compared withLum +/+ Fmod +/+) indicates that fibromodulin deficiency is a prerequisite for weak tendons and that fibromodulin contributes significantly to tendon strength. The magnitude of the reduction in stiffness associated with fibromodulin deficiency depends on the number of functioning lumican alleles (data in italic in Table I). When compared with wild type,Lum +/+ Fmod −/−,Lum +/− Fmod −/−, and theLum −/− Fmod −/− tendons exhibit a decrease in stiffness of 25% (p < 0.01), 45% (p < 0.001), and 61% (p < 0.001), respectively. The maximum load measurements (data not shown) demonstrate similar genotype-"
https://openalex.org/W2120365849,"Although homo-oligomerization has been reported for several G protein-coupled receptors, this phenomenon was not studied at low concentrations of receptors. Furthermore, it is not clear whether homo-oligomerization corresponds to an intrinsic property of nascent receptors or if it is a consequence of receptor activation. Here CCR5 receptor oligomerization was studied by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) in cells expressing physiological levels of receptors. A strong energy transfer could be observed, in the absence of ligands, in whole cells and in both endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane subfractions, supporting the hypothesis of a constitutive oligomerization that occurs early after biosynthesis. No change in BRET was observed upon agonist binding, indicating that the extent of oligomerization is unrelated to the activation state of the receptor. In contrast, a robust increase of BRET, induced by a monoclonal antibody known to promote receptor clustering, suggests that microaggregation of preformed receptor homo-oligomers can occur. Taken together, our data indicate that constitutive receptor homo-oligomerization has a biologically relevant significance and might be involved in the process of receptor biosynthesis.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GABA, γ-amino butyric acid; hRluc, “humanized” Renilla luciferase; MIP-1β, macrophage inflammatory polypeptide 1β; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; YFP, yellow mutant of the enhanced green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting. constitute the largest family of membrane receptors. They are involved in the regulation of most biological functions and represent, collectively, one of the most important targets for therapeutic intervention. A rapidly growing number of studies indicate that GPCRs may be organized as oligomers (1Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The biological function of this phenomenon was questioned for some time until it was reported that the hetero-oligomerization of two isoforms of the GABABreceptor was indispensable for the formation of functional GABAB binding sites in tissues (2Kaupmann K. Malitschek B. Schuler V. Heid J. Froestl W. Beck P. Mosbacher J. Bischoff S. Kulik A. Shigemoto R. Karschin A. Bettler B.

Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Barnes A.A. Emson P. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Hetero-oligomerization of other GPCRs has also been proposed as a mean to increase pharmacological diversity and expand signaling modes for this class of receptors (5Jordan B.A. Devi L.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar, 6Rocheville M. Science. 2000; 288: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the role that receptor homo-oligomerization could play. The fact that homo-oligomerization has been studied mainly with receptors overexpressed in heterologous systems has even raised concerns about the biological relevance of this phenomenon. Whether oligomeric complexes form at the plasma membrane or in other subcellular compartments and whether or not oligomers result from a dynamic, regulated, and reversible assembly of monomers following receptor activation are two other important and still open questions. The latter question, in particular, was the object of several studies using different experimental approaches that gave different interpretations. For example, it was concluded that agonists could increase homo-oligomerization of β2-adrenergic (7Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) and TRH (8Kroeger K.M. Hanyaloglu A.C. Seeber R.M. Miles L.E. Eidne K.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19487-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The issue of receptor oligomerization and its potential regulation by agonists is of particular interest for the chemokine receptor CCR5, one of the two major co-receptors for the human immunodeficiency virusin vivo, since it has been suggested that CCR5 dimerization might prevent human immunodeficiency virus infection (11Vila-Coro A.J. Mellado M. Martin De Ana A. Lucas P. del Real G. Martinez A.C. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3388-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In one study, CCR5 homo-oligomerization was detected after chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation of solubilized receptors but only if cells were previously treated with an agonist or a divalent antibody. The authors concluded that the CCR5 receptor exists exclusively as monomeric entities under basal conditions and that it oligomerizes only upon receptor activation or antibody-mediated reticulation (11Vila-Coro A.J. Mellado M. Martin De Ana A. Lucas P. del Real G. Martinez A.C. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3388-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These conclusions are, however, difficult to reconcile with a previous study in which constitutive CCR5 dimers were resolved under low stringent conditions of protein denaturation (12Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F. Koup R.A. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30603-30606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The fact that two similar studies, both based on immunoprecipitation experiments from cells expressing uncontrolled levels of receptors, reached such divergent conclusions prompted us to develop another experimental approach to study CCR5 homo-oligomerization in living cells at physiological concentrations of receptor. In the present study, CCR5 receptor oligomerization was investigated in intact HEK-293 cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Unambiguous constitutive homo-oligomerization, evidenced by a robust energy transfer in the absence of ligands, could be demonstrated in HEK-293 cells expressing the same density of CCR5 receptors as found in human monocytes and lymphocytes. Furthermore, consistent with the notion of constitutive oligomerization, BRET was detected within the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that oligomerization occurs early after receptor biosynthesis. Antibodies but not agonists could increase the basal energy transfer, probably as a result of preformed oligomer clustering. If not otherwise specified, all chemicals and reagents were from Sigma. The CCR5 and CXCR4 coding sequences without a stop codon were amplified using sense and antisense primers harboring unique HindIII and BamHI sites. The fragments were then subcloned in frame into theHindIII/BamHI sites of the pGFP-N1-Topaz, (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and a humanized form ofRenilla luciferase (hRluc)-N3, (BioSignal; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) vectors encoding the YFP yellow variant of green fluorescent protein, and of the humanizedRenilla luciferase. In the resulting constructs, YFP and hRluc were directly fused to the 3′-end of the receptor cDNAs. Peripheral mononuclear cells were isolated from freshly collected heparinized blood of healthy adult donors by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (Eurobio Biotechnology, Les Ulis, France) as previously described (13Ferrante A. Thong Y.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 36: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). CD4+ and CD14+ populations were identified by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody binding (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany). Lymphocytes, separated from monocytes by adherence on plastic, were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine, at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. They were stimulated by 3-day incubation with anti-CD3 antibodies (UCHT-1; Seralab) bound to dynabeads (Dynal) precoated with sheep anti-mouse IgG. Binding to beads was achieved by incubating 0.5 μg of anti-CD3 antibodies with 107 beads in PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) and HeLa cells, maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and streptomycin (all from Invitrogen), were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells in 35-mm plates. Transient transfections were performed the following day using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested and used 24 h after transfection. Stable cell lines expressing wild-type CCR5 or CCR5 fused to either YFP or hRluc were also selected using 600 μg/ml G418 in the culture medium. The expression level of stable clones was assessed by quantitative FACS analysis as described below. Cyclic AMP assays were conducted on stable HEK-293 clones expressing wild-type CCR5 or CCR5 fused to either YFP or hRluc. The accumulation of cAMP in intact cells was determined using the Alpha-Screen system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). This immunoassay is based on the competition between the cAMP contained within the cells to be tested and biotinylated cAMP. Biotinylated cAMP is complexed by streptavidin molecules, which are covalently bound to “donor” beads, whereas an anti-cAMP monoclonal antibody is bound to “acceptor” beads. The interaction between biotinylated cAMP and the antibody bridges donor and acceptor beads. Upon appropriate irradiation (680 nm) of the donor beads, singlet oxygen is released and diffuses to activate the acceptor beads only if donor and acceptor beads are in close proximity. Activated acceptor beads then emit at 520–620 nm. The emission signal, recorded using a polyvalent fluorescence-luminescence detector (Fusion; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) decreased linearly with the increase of competing cellular cAMP concentration. Calibration curves were constructed using known concentrations of added cAMP. Adenylyl cyclase inhibition, promoted by the activation of wild-type CCR5, CCR5-YFP, and CCR5-hRluc, was measured in stable clones incubated with increasing concentrations of MIP-1β (Preprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ), after enzyme prestimulation with 10 μmforskolin. Receptor internalization was assessed by flow cytometry (FACS). HEK-293 cells, expressing either wild-type CCR5, CCR5-YFP, or CCR5-hRluc were incubated at 37 °C with 100 nm RANTES (R & D Systems Europe, Abingdon, UK) or a 10 μg/ml concentration of the anti-CCR5 MC-1 monoclonal antibody for the indicated time. After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were incubated for 2 min at 37 °C in an acidic buffer, containing 100 mm NaCl and 50 mm glycine, pH 3, to remove bound RANTES or the MC-1 antibody. Cells were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with the monoclonal phycoerythrin-conjugated 2D7 antibody, directed against CCR5 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Cells were then washed with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 1% formaldehyde. Samples were analyzed with a Becton-Dickinson flow cytometer. Base-line fluorescence, determined from untransfected HEK-293 cells, was subtracted from each sample, and the cell surface expression was defined as the mean fluorescence signal multiplied by the number of positive cells. 24 h after transfection with the indicated cDNAs encoding BRET donors and acceptors, HEK-293 or HeLa cells were detached with PBS/EDTA and washed in PBS. Aliquots of 1 × 105 cells were distributed in the wells of 96-well microplates (White Optiplate from PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of CCR5 ligands (100 nm) or antibodies (10 μg/ml). The monoclonal MC-1, MC-5, and MC-6 antibodies, directed against various epitopes of the CCR5 receptor, were generated in the laboratory of Dr. Matthias Mack (University of Munich). Single-chain antibody and Fab fragments from the MC-1 antibody were prepared as described (14Blanpain C. Vanderwinden J.M. Cihak J. Wittamer V., Le Poul E. Issafras H. Stangassinger M. Vassart G. Marullo S. Schlöndorff D. Parmentier M. Mack M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The luciferase substrate, coelenterazine h(Molecular Probes Europe, Leiden, The Netherlands), was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and emitted luminescence and fluorescence were measured simultaneously using the FUSION fluorescence-luminescence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells expressing BRET donors alone (receptors fused to hRluc) were used to determine background. Filter sets were 485 ± 10 nm for luciferase emission and 530 ± 12.5 nm for YFP emission. Mean values from five consecutive measurements were used to determine BRET ratios that were calculated as described (15Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 was quantified by flow cytometry using the phycoerythrin-conjugated 2D7 and 12G5 monoclonal antibodies (PharMingen), respectively. The number of PE molecules bound on the surface of lymphocytes, monocytes, and transfected HEK-293 cells was determined in parallel, using the Quanti-BRITE PE Fluorescence Quantitation kit (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA) and the software provided by the manufacturer. For each experiment, fluorescence calibration curves were established with beads coated with known amounts of epitopes. Receptor density was expressed as the number of epitopes recognized by the antibodies per mg of total proteins, measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). To determine the proportion of receptors at the cell surface, comparative FACS analyses were conducted on intact cells and cells permeabilized with 0.05% saponin for 1 h at 4 °C. HEK-293 cells grown in 10-cm dishes were transiently transfected with CCR5-hRluc and CCR5-YFP plasmids. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, scraped off the dish, and lysed with 1 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 6 mmmagnesium chloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine). The cell lysate was homogenized with 50 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Cellular debris and unlysed cells were removed by centrifuging at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and sucrose was added to obtain a final concentration of 0.2 m sucrose. The discontinuous sucrose step gradient was made using the above hypotonic lysis buffer with the addition of sucrose at the following final molar concentrations: 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, 1.35, 1.5, and 2.0. Each step in the gradient had a total volume of 5 ml. The samples were centrifuged for 16 h at 27,000 rpm in a Beckman SW28 rotor. A total of 31 fractions of 1 ml each were collected from the top of the tube. BRET was measured on 100 μl of each fraction. The efficiency of the sucrose gradient to resolve the plasma membrane from the endoplasmic reticulum was verified by immunoblotting. Each fraction was probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the α subunit of the Na/K-ATPase pump (Sigma A-276) (plasma membrane marker) at a dilution of 1:250 and a polyclonal anti-calnexin antibody (Stressgen Biotechnologies SPA-860) (endoplasmic reticulum marker) at a dilution of 1:8000. HeLa cells expressing either wild-type dynamin or the K44A dominant negative mutant of dynamin, both under the control of a regulated tetracyclin promoter (Tet-off system), were generated in the laboratory of Dr. Sandra Schmid (Scripps Clinic, San Diego, CA). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml each penicillin and streptomycin, 400 μg/ml G418, 200 ng/ml puromycin, and 1 μg/ml doxycyclin. Overexpression of wild-type and dominant negative K44A dynamin was induced by removing doxycyclin from the medium 12 h after the transfection with the cDNAs encoding CCR5-hRluc and CCR5-YFP. BRET analysis and the endocytosis assay were conducted in parallel 48 h after transfection. Under these conditions, a ∼20-fold overexpression of dynamin could be obtained, as determined by Western blots carried on whole-cell lysates with a monoclonal anti-dynamin antibody from the laboratory of Dr. Sandra Schmidt. For immunofluorescence studies, HeLa cells were seeded on coverslips in six-well plates, transfected with a plasmid encoding CCR5-YFP, and used for immunofluorescence 2 days post-transfection. After the indicated treatments, cells were fixed and processed for fluorescence microscopy as described previously (16Scott M.G. Benmerah A. Muntaner O. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3552-3559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Samples were examined under an epifluorescence microscope (Leica DM-IRB) attached to a cooled CCD camera (Micromax 1300YHS; Princeton Instruments). Images were processed using the Metamorph™ software. Previous studies, based on immunoprecipitation assays after cell solubilization, indicated that CCR5 receptors might form homo- and hetero-oligomers (12Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F. Koup R.A.

Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). However, these studies were discrepant on important issues such as the constitutive or induced nature of CCR5 oligomerization. In an effort to better characterize CCR5 oligomerization in living cells, we took advantage of a biophysical assay based on BRET, which was initially developed to monitor homodimerization of cyanobacteria clock proteins (19Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) and more recently applied to the study of GPCRs oligomerization (see Ref. 18Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar for a review). Based on the Förster equation (20Mahajan N.P. Linder K. Berry G. Gordon G.W. Heim R. Herman B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), it was estimated that the distance allowing energy transfer between BRET pairs is on the order of 25–100 Å. Therefore, the detection of a specific BRET between two receptors demonstrates a physical proximity that can be explained best by the formation of receptor dimers or oligomers (15Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). For this purpose, fusion proteins were constructed between CCR5 and either hRluc or YFP. FACS analysis of intact and permeabilized HEK-293 cells, transiently expressing each chimeric receptor, revealed a subcellular distribution similar to that of control wild-type CCR5 receptor: about 70% of both native or chimeric receptors was found at the plasma membrane 24 h after transfection (data not shown). Fusion receptors maintained their functional properties, as indicated by the similar potencies of MIP-1β to inhibit forskolin-promoted cAMP production via wild-type CCR5, CCR5-hRluc, and CCR5-YFP (IC50 of 1.61 ± 0.08, 1.5 ± 0.07, and 0.83 ± 0.03 nm, respectively; Fig.1 A). Also, agonist binding induced a similar extent and rate of receptor internalization of each receptor construct (Fig. 1 B). The cDNAs encoding CCR5-hRluc and CCR5-YFP were transiently co-expressed in HEK-293 cells, and the energy transfer was measured after the addition of coelenterazine h, the cell-permeable substrate of hRluc. As shown in Fig.2 A, a significant (p < 0.01) energy transfer was observed between CCR5-hRluc and CCR5-YFP upon coelenterazine h addition in the absence of any CCR5 ligand. No such signal was observed in cells expressing CCR5-hRLuc alone or when CCR5-YFP was replaced by a closely related chemokine receptor, fused to YFP (CXCR4-YFP). The CXCR4 receptor was preferred to the CCR2 as a negative control for BRET, as it was reported that the latter receptor might form functional hetero-oligomers with CCR5 (17Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Vila-Coro A.J. Fernandez S. Martin de Ana A. Jones D.R. Toran J.L. Martinez A.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2497-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The lack of BRET between CCR5-hRluc and CXCR4-YFP did not result from the inability of CXCR4 to serve as a BRET acceptor, since a particularly strong signal was observed upon co-expression of CXCR4-YFP and CXCR4-hRluc. The stronger signal observed with CXCR4 does not necessarily reflect a higher proportion of receptors engaged in constitutive oligomers, since it could result from differences in orientation and/or distance between BRET partners. The selectivity of the interaction was also demonstrated by BRET competition experiments where the BRET signal was studied in the presence of increasing concentrations of native receptors. Overexpression of CCR5 but not of CXCR4 inhibited the transfer of energy between CCR5-hRluc and CCR5-YFP (Fig. 2 B). BRET data, which support the existence of constitutive CCR5 oligomerization, are in agreement with a previous report in which CCR5 oligomers could be immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of untreated cells and visualized by Western blot (12Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F. Koup R.A. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30603-30606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, in other reports, CCR5 oligomers became apparent only when intact cells were preincubated with agonists or bivalent antibodies before chemical cross-linking, solubilization and immunoprecipitation (11Vila-Coro A.J. Mellado M. Martin De Ana A. Lucas P. del Real G. Martinez A.C. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3388-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Mellado M.

By comparing the experimental protocols used in these studies, we noticed that the authors, who could not detect the presence of constitutive dimers, used more stringent denaturing conditions. We therefore conducted a series of immunoprecipitation studies on solubilized CCR5, in which we varied the composition of the sample buffer, and confirmed that the relative proportion of oligomeric receptors markedly decreased as the denaturing conditions became more stringent. CCR5 oligomers completely disappeared after resuspension of immunoprecipitated material in a classical Laemmli buffer, whereas, under low stringent conditions, oligomers were visible even in the absence of agonist treatment (see supplementary material). These data suggest a different interpretation of the actual role that agonists and antibodies play in the visualization of CCR5 oligomers following covalent cross-linking (11Vila-Coro A.J. Mellado M. Martin De Ana A. Lucas P. del Real G. Martinez A.C. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3388-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Mellado M. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Vila-Coro A.J. Fernandez S. Martin de Ana A. Jones D.R. Toran J.L. Martinez A.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2497-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar); the chemical bridging of adjacent CCR5 molecules, which maintains the complexes in denaturing conditions, may only occur when receptors adopt a specific conformation promoted by the agonist or when receptors are preclustered by antibodies. BRET experiments, indicating that both CCR5 and CXCR4 receptors form constitutive homo-oligomers but not CCR5-CXCR4 hetero-oligomers, are also consistent with recent electron microscopy observations indicating that chemokine receptors, including CCR5, CXCR4, and CCR2, are found within closely apposed but distinct clusters of 50–100 nm at the plasma membrane of macrophages, T cells, and fibroblasts (21Singer I.I. Scott S. Kawka D.W. Chin J. Daugherty B.L. DeMartino J.A. DiSalvo J. Gould S.L. Lineberger J.E. Malkowitz L. Miller M.D. Mitnaul L. Siciliano S.J. Staruch M.J. Williams H.R. Zweerink H.J. Springer M.S. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3779-3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). One of the major concerns when studying receptor oligomerization is the level of expression necessary to monitor oligomer formation, since a high concentration of receptors might cause random interactions between overexpressed receptor molecules. A recent analysis of the theory for FRET indicated a way to distinguish between FRET due to specific “clustering” of donors and acceptors and FRET due to high concentrations of donors and acceptors that are randomly distributed in the membrane. If donor and acceptor fluorophores are clustered, FRET is independent of absolute donor and acceptor surface densities but is dependent on the donor/acceptor ratio. In contrast, if donor and acceptor fluorophores are randomly distributed, FRET varies with acceptor density, and it is insensitive to the donor/acceptor ratio (22Kenworthy A.K. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 23Pentcheva T. Edidin M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6625-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Since FRET and BRET are based on the same physical principle, the same rules determined for membrane protein clustering in FRET experiments should apply for BRET. Therefore, BRET studies were conducted in HEK-293 cells transfected with either increasing amounts of a fixed ratio of donor/acceptor cDNAs or with decreasing donor/acceptor ratios (Fig. 3). In the first set of experiments, the energy transfer remained stable for surface receptor levels ranging from 40 to 100 fmol of receptor/mg of membrane proteins (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, the BRET signal increased linearly over the same range of total surface receptors, when a fixed amount of donor DNA was coexpressed with increasing concentrations of the acceptor DNA (Fig. 3 B). These data indicate that the constitutive energy transfer between CCR5-hRluc and CCR5-YFP reflects a nonrandom association between the two receptor species. In addition, to determine whether specific BRET signals could be detected at physiologically relevant expression levels, precise assessments of cell surface receptors were carried out by quantitative FACS analysis. The receptor densities in transfected HEK-293 cells were then compared with those existing in human hematopoietic cells prepared from healthy donors. Specific BRET was detected in cells expressing as little as 40 fmol of receptor per mg of membrane proteins, corresponding to 8–10 × 103 surface receptors/cell (Fig. 3 A). These receptor concentrations fall well within the range measured in human activated lymphocytes and monocytes (Fig.3 C). Another important issue in studies on GPCR oligomerization has been to determine whether ligands can modulate the amount of oligomers. We found that incubation with RANTES or MIP-1β for up to 10 min had no effect on the energy transfer between CCR5-hRluc and CCR5-YFP (Fig.4 A), indicating that CCR5 agonists"

However, we have isolated a psychrophilic xylanase that belongs to family 8 and which has both a high pI and high molecular mass. This novel xylanase, isolated from the Antarctic bacteriumPseudoalteromonas haloplanktis, is not homologous to family 10 or 11 enzymes but has 20–30% identity with family 8 members. NMR analysis shows that this enzyme hydrolyzes with inversion of anomeric configuration, in contrast to other known xylanases which are retaining. No cellulase, chitosanase or lichenase activity was detected. It appears to be functionally similar to family 11 xylanases. It hydrolyzes xylan to principally xylotriose and xylotetraose and is most active on long chain xylo-oligosaccharides. Kinetic studies indicate that it has a large substrate binding cleft, containing at least six xylose-binding subsites. Typical psychrophilic characteristics of a high catalytic activity at low temperatures and low thermal stability are observed. An evolutionary tree of family 8 enzymes revealed the presence of six distinct clusters. Indeed classification in family 8 would suggest an (α/α)6fold, distinct from that of other currently known xylanases.

Indeed classification in family 8 would suggest an (α/α)6fold, distinct from that of other currently known xylanases. Xylanases (EC 3.2.1.8, endo-1,4-β-xylan xylanohydrolase) areO-glycoside hydrolases that catalyze the random hydrolysis of internal β-1,4-d-xylosidic linkages of xylan, a major component of plant hemicellulose and constituting 15–30% of the cell wall content of hardwoods, 7–10% of softwoods, and up to 30% of annual plants (1Prade R.A. Biotechnol. & Genet. Eng. Rev. 1995; 13: 100-131Google Scholar). Xylan is a complex, highly branched heteropolymer of variable size (70–130 units in softwoods and 150–200 units in hardwoods). Depending on the source, the xylan backbone may contain a varying degree of glucuronosyl, 4-O-methyl-d-glucuronopyranosyl, α-l-arabinofuranosyl, acetyl, feruloyl, and/orp-coumaroyl substituents. Unsubstituted linear xylans also exist and have been isolated from esparto grass and seaweed (2Beg Q.K. Kapoor M. Mahajan L. Hoondal G.S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). The wide diversity of xylan structures is paralleled by a large variety of xylanases with widely different hydrolytic activities, physicochemical properties, and structures. In an attempt to contend with this diversity of enzymes, Henrissat (3Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar) introduced a classification system for glycoside hydrolases based on sequence homologies and designed to integrate both structural and mechanistic features. Currently 87 families have been identified, and members of each family are believed to have evolved from a common ancestral sequence. Divergent evolution to acquire new substrate specificity has resulted in more than one-third of the families being polyspecific (4Henrissat B. Coutinho P.M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 330: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and in different families having a related fold. As the structures of proteins are better conserved than their sequences, the grouping of several families in “clans” has thus been introduced (5Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). In contrast, convergent evolution has resulted in enzymes with identical substrate and reaction specificity being found in totally unrelated families with disparate three-dimensional folds (6Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). Endo-β-1,4-d-xylanases have been assigned to two distinct families, 10 (formerly F) and 11 (formerly G) (7Bergquist P.L. Gibbs M.D. Morris D.D. Thompson D.R. Uhl A.M. Daniel R.M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 330: 301-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 8Hurlbert J.C. Preston III, J.F. J.

Indeed, this separation into two families is in agreement with an earlier classification by Wong et al. (10Wong K.K.Y. Tan L.U.L. Saddler J.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 305-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who indicated that xylanases generally either have a high molecular mass (>30 kDa) and low pI or a low molecular mass (<30 kDa) and high pI. It has been found that family 10 generally groups acidic high molecular mass enzymes, whereas family 11 members are generally much smaller basic proteins, although acidic pI values have been observed for some enzymes of fungal origin (11Georis J. de Lemos Esteves F. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Bougnet V. Devreese B. Giannotta F. Granier B. Frere J.M. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A significant difference in the structure and catalytic properties of the two families also occurs. Family 10 members present an (α/β)8 barrel fold (12Dominguez R. Souchon H. Spinelli S. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Chauvaux S. Beguin P. Alzari P.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), belong to clan GH-A, the 4/7 superfamily (13Henrissat B. Callebaut I. Fabrega S. Lehn P. Mornon J.P. Davies G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7090-7094Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), and have ∼40% of the secondary structure in an α-helical form (14Derewenda U. Swenson L. Green R. Wei Y. Morosoli R. Shareck F. Kluepfel D. Derewenda Z.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20811-20814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Members of family 11 are ∼3–5% α-helical in nature, have a β-jelly roll fold conformation (15Torronen A. Harkki A. Rouvinen J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2493-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and belong to clan GH-C. In relation to their catalytic properties, it has been found that family 10 xylanases typically have smaller substrate-binding sites, lower substrate specificities (frequently having endoglucanase activity), and hydrolyze heteroxylans to a higher degree (16Biely P. Vrsanska M. Tenkanen M. Kluepfel D. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 57: 151-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) as compared with family 11 xylanases (true xylanases). The common feature of the two families is in the mode of action. All xylanases characterized to date retain the anomeric configuration of the glycosidic oxygen following hydrolysis in which two conserved glutamates function as the catalytic nucleophile and acid/base catalyst (17Jeffries T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1996; 7: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the present study we have isolated a novel cold-active xylanase that belongs to glycoside hydrolase family 8 (formerly D), a family that is mainly composed of endoglucanases (EC 3.2.1.4) as well as lichenases (EC 3.2.1.73) and chitosanases (EC 3.2.1.132) and that typically operates with inversion of anomeric configuration. The cloning, overexpression, purification, and characterization of this novel xylanase as well as the evolutionary relationships within family 8 members are described. Catalytic properties including the specificity, action pattern, and mode of action of this enzyme are also assessed. Unless otherwise stated products were obtained from Sigma. The xylanase producing bacterial strain was isolated from soil samples collected in the vicinity of the French Antarctic station in Dumont D'Urville, Terre Adelie, Antarctica (66°40′S; 140°01′E). Screening for xylanase activity was carried out on marine agar (5 g/liter tryptone (Difco), 1 g/liter yeast extract (Difco), 33 g/liter marine salts (Wiegandt), 18 g/liter agar (Difco)) supplemented with 0.15% RBB 1The abbreviations used are: RBB, Remazol Brilliant Blue; NMWL, nominal molecular weight limit; ALF, automated laser fluorescence; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; BICINE, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; TAPS, 3-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}-1-propanesulfonic acid; DNS, dinitrosalicylic acid; pNp, para-nitrophenol; X1, xylose; X2, xylobiose; X3, xylotriose; X4, xylotetraose; X5, xylopentaose; X6, xylohexaose; IsoX3, isomeric xylotriose; IsoX4, isomeric xylotetraose; IsoX5, isomeric xylopentaose; IsoX6, isomeric xylohexaose; MU, 4-methylumbelliferyl. -xylan at 4 °C. Microscopic identification, Gram staining and fatty acid methyl ester fingerprint analyses were used to identify the isolate. Cellular fatty acids were extracted and quantified by gas-liquid chromatography and identified using the Microbial Identification System data base (18Mergaert J. Verdonk L. Kersters K. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1993; 43: 162-173Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar), TSBA version 4.1 (Microbial ID Inc.). Growth and xylanase production at 4 and 28 °C were examined in marine broth by monitoring the absorbance (A 550 nm) and xylanase activity of the culture supernatant at various time points. Growth and enzyme production at 4 °C in various culture media (marine broth, Luria Bertani, minimal media M63/M9 (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: A.1-A.13Google Scholar)) and with various supplements (xylan and salts) were also examined. The Antarctic isolate was cultivated in 1 liter of modified marine broth (5 g/liter tryptone (Difco), 1 g/liter yeast extract (Difco), 20 g/liter marine salts) supplemented with 1.5% birchwood xylan for 72 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 1 h at 18,000 ×g and 4 °C the supernatant was concentrated to ∼100 ml by ultrafiltration on a Millipore PBGC 10000 NMWL membrane and dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm BICINE, 10 mmNaCl, pH 8.5). The dialysate was loaded on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column (9 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated in the same buffer, and the void was collected and immediately loaded on a S-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column (7 × 2.5 cm), also equilibrated in the above-mentioned buffer, and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–100 mm in 350 ml). The psychrophilic xylanase gene was isolated and sequenced using a procedure similar to that described previously (20Bentahir M. Feller G. Aittaleb M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Himri T. Chessa J.P.

Degenerate primers based on the amino-terminal sequence (5′-GCITTYAAYAAYAAYCC-3′) and an internal peptide sequence determined after CNBr cleavage (see “Analytical Procedures”) (5′-RTTRTTRTAICCRAACAT-3′) allowed amplification of a 101-bp fragment from the genomic DNA. The complete xylanase gene sequence was identified from an enriched PstI (3–6-kb fragments) genomic library in pUC19 by PCR screening using specific primers derived from the 101-bp isolated sequence (5′-CGTTTAATAATAACCCATCGAGTGTAGGC-3′ and 5′-GTTGTAGCCGAACATATTGTCAAAAGTACTAT-3′). Double-stranded sequencing was carried out with an ALF DNA sequencer (AmershamBiosciences). The xylanase gene, including its signal sequence, was PCR-amplified usingPwo polymerase (Eurogentec), with the sense primer (5′-GGGCATATGAAAGTATTTTTTAAAATAACAACTT-3′) containing an NdeI site (underlined) and the antisense primer (5′-GCTACTTAGGTAGTGTTATTTTAATTAAACGTGTTGTTATAA-3′) containing the stop codon (underlined). The PCR product was cloned into the PCR-Script Amp SK(+) cloning vector (Stratagene), excised withNdeI and XhoI and ligated into the pET22b(+) cloning vector (Novagen). The resulting recombinant plasmid was transformed to Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Stratagene). Five ml of an overnight preculture (18 °C) of theE. coli BL21 (DE3) cells carrying the xylanase gene was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 300 ml of Terrific broth (12 g/liter Bacto tryptone (Difco), 24 g/liter yeast extract (Difco), 4 ml/liter glycerol, 12.54 g/liter K2HPO4, 2.31 g/liter KH2PO4) containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin in a 3-liter shake flask. The culture was incubated at 18 °C and 250 rpm until an absorbance at 550 nm of between 3 and 4 was reached, whereupon the expression of the enzyme was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside. Following a further 20-h incubation at 18 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, resuspended in modified buffer A (no NaCl), disrupted in a prechilled cell disrupter (Constant Systems Ltd.) at 28 K pounds/square inch, centrifuged at 40,000 × g, and dialyzed against modified buffer A (no NaCl). The dialysate was then subjected to Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (50 × 2.5 cm) and S-Sepharose Fast Flow purification as described for the wild-type enzyme but using modified buffer A (no NaCl). Active fractions were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Millipore PBGC 10,000 NMWL), and further purified on a Sephacryl S-100 (Amersham Biosciences) column (90 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated in 20 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, at 1 ml min−1. The 20,585-Da mesophilic family 11 xylanase (Xyl1) from Streptomyces sp. S38 was obtained from J. Georis (see Ref. 22Georis J. Giannotta F. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Devreese B. Van Beeumen J. Granier B. Frere J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The temperature optimum was determined by monitoring activity over 5 min at pH 6.5 between 5–65 °C and 20–80 °C for the psychrophilic and mesophilic enzymes, respectively. Thermostability of the enzymes was evaluated by measuring the residual activity as a function of time at 55 °C in 20 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 500 mm3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate, pH 7.5. Kinetic parameters of the psychrophilic xylanase were determined at 25 °C by non-linear regression using the Michaelis-Menten equation of initial rates determined between 0 and 30 mg/ml soluble birchwood xylan. The inability to measure activity at higher substrate concentrations due to substrate interference and high viscosity meant substrate saturation was not achieved and thus extrapolation was used in determination of the kinetic values, giving rise to apparent values. The pH dependence of the psychrophilic xylanase was determined at 25 °C between pH 4.5 and 12 using the following buffer mix: 40 mm sodium acetate, 20 mm MES, 20 mm MOPS, 20 mm TAPS, 20 mm CHES, and 20 mmCAPS. The effect of various heavy metals, chelators, and ions was examined by determining the activity in the presence of 1 and 10 mm of the various compounds. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out in a Microcal MCS-DSC apparatus using the MCS Observer software package for data acquisition, analysis, and deconvolution. Analysis was carried out with 2 mg/ml recombinant protein in 20 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 500 mm3-(1-pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate, pH 7.5, at a scan rate of 1 °C/min and under 1 atmosphere nitrogen pressure. Due to irreversibility of the denaturation, only the apparentT m (melting temperature) and apparentΔH cal (calorimetric enthalpy of unfolding) could be calculated. Xylanase activity was measured at 25 °C (psychrophile) and 50 °C (mesophile) by a modification of the DNS method as described (23Petrescu I. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Chessa J.P. Ntarima P. Claeyssens M. Devreese B. Marino G. Gerday C. Extremophiles. 2000; 4: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); 3% soluble birchwood xylan (24Matte A. Forsberg C.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 157-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 100 mm citrate-phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, was used as substrate. The stereoselectivity of hydrolysis was analyzed essentially as described (25Gebler J. Gilkes N.R. Claeyssens M. Wilson D.B. Beguin P. Wakarchuk W.W. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12559-12561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 0.8% Nothogenia erinacea xylan, isolated as described previously (26Nunn J.R. Parolis H. Russel I. Carbohydr. Res. 1973; 26: 169-180Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and 43.5 μm enzyme, lyophilized and redissolved twice in D2O, were used. Proton NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Digital NMR Avance 500 spectrometer at 25 °C using a 5-mm sample tube. Spectra were recorded immediately after mixing and at 15-min intervals for 1 h. Activity on birchwood xylan, beechwood xylan, oat spelt xylan, CM-cellulose (Fluka), microcrystalline cellulose (Aldrich), cellobiose, arabinogalactan (from larchwood), lichenane (from Cetraria islandica), laminarin (from Laminaria digitata), and starch (from potato) was determined by the DNS method at 25 °C with a final substrate concentration of 3%. Due to interaction of the chitosan with the citrate-phosphate buffer and insolubility at pH 6.5, the assay for chitosanase activity was carried out in potassium hydrogen phthalate buffer at pH 6.0. Activity was measured at 25 °C by monitoring the decrease in viscosity over 30 h with a Brookfield LVDV viscometer. ChitoclearTMlow viscosity (3% acetylation) and FC222B (17% acetylation) chitosan (Primex Ingredients) were examined, and appropriate controls were included in all cases. Activity onpNp-β-d-glucopyranoside,pNp-α-d-glucopyranoside,pNp-β-d-cellobioside,pNp-β-d-galactopyranoside,pNp-β-d-glucuronide,pNp-α-d-maltoside,pNp-β-d-xylopyranoside, andpNp-α-d-xylopyranoside was examined at 25 °C at a final concentration of 5 mm. To determine the extent of hydrolysis of birchwood, oat spelt andPalmaria palmata xylan, 25 nm enzyme was incubated at 25 °C, pH 6.5, with a 3% substrate solution containing 0.01% sodium azide (Merck), samples were removed at various time points, boiled for 4 min, filtered through a 0.45-μm Millex membrane (Millipore) and analyzed for reducing sugars by the DNS method. Products of enzymatic hydrolysis were analyzed using a high performance anion exchange chromatography system (Dionex Corp.) equipped with an ED40 pulsed amperometric detector (HPAE-PAD). The Dionex Carbopac PA100 column (4 × 250 mm) was equilibrated at 1 ml min−1in 100 mm NaOH, 20 mm sodium acetate, and product separation was obtained with a four-step linear gradient: 20–40 mm sodium acetate in 20 ml, 40–100 mmsodium acetate in 10 ml, 100–160 mm sodium acetate in 10 ml, and 160–200 mm sodium acetate in 1 ml. Xylo-oligosaccharides, X1–X6 (Megazyme), aldopentaouronic and aldohexaouronic acid (Megazyme), and mixed linkage (β1,4; β1,3) standards, IsoX3 and IsoX4, were used for peak identification. The kinetics of hydrolysis of xylo-oligosaccharides was determined as described by Bray and Clarke (27Bray M.R. Clarke A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using the Dionex HPAE-PAD system. Xylo-oligosaccharide separation was achieved with a linear gradient of 20–40 mm sodium acetate in 20 ml. Reactions were carried out at 25 °C using 0–10 mm X1, X2, X3, X4, 0–6.3 mm X5, and 0–3.8 mm X6, and kinetic parameters were determined by non-linear regression of initial rates of product formation using the Michaelis-Menten equation. The action of 0.2 μm enzyme on 1 mmMU-xylobioside, 1 mm MU-xylotrioside, 100 μmMU-cellotrioside, and 100 μm MU-cellopentaoside (28van Tilbeurgh H. Loontiens F.G., De Bruyne C.K. Claeyssens M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 160: 45-57Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) was examined by fluorescence and analysis on the Dionex HPAE-PAD system. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) and/or by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 95,420 and 62,930m−1 cm−1 for the psychrophilic and mesophilic xylanase, respectively. Analytical SDS-PAGE was run essentially as described by the instrument supplier (Hoefer). The isoelectric point was determined essentially as described (30Huang L. Forsberg C.W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1987; 53: 1034-1041Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amino-terminal sequencing was carried out using a Procise 492 pulsed liquid phase protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with ∼20–30 pmol of protein. CNBr cleavage of the protein was carried out overnight under atmospheric nitrogen in 70% formic acid with 2% (v/v) 5m CNBr (Fluka). Resulting fragments were separated on 17.5% SDS-PAGE, electroblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and subjected to amino-terminal sequencing. Carboxyl-terminal sequencing was performed on a Procise 494C Sequencer (PE Biosystems) with 1 nmol of enzyme as described (31Samyn B. Hardeman K. Van der Eycken J. Van Beeumen J. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 1389-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The molecular mass was determined by nano-electrospray ionization spectrometry on a Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass) with 20 pmol of enzyme. Family 8 members were identified from the carbohydrate-active enzymes server (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/) and by a protein database (SWALL) fasta33-t search (32Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar) with the isolated psychrophilic xylanase sequence. Surplus or additional regions and domains were removed, leaving essentially the catalytic core. The tree was then constructed with the Drawtree program (33Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar) by application of the neighbor-joining method (34Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) to multiple alignments from the ClustalW program (35Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). The xylanase-producing strain was identified as the Gram-negative bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis with a Microbial Identification Score of 0.391 and no alternative was proposed. Fig. 1 shows that this bacterium has typical cold-adapted characteristics as xylanase production and stability are much higher at 4 than at 28 °C. Furthermore, the optical density at 28 °C drops rapidly to zero, indicating cell lysis at this temperature. Optimal growth occurs in marine broth containing high concentrations of marine salts (20 g/liter) and optimal xylanase production was obtained with high concentrations (1.5%) of xylan, birchwood being more suitable than oat spelt due to foaming induced by the less soluble oat spelt xylan at high concentrations. Low quantities of xylanase activity were detected in the absence of xylan in the production medium indicating that it is produced constitutively by the isolate. This organism is, however, unable to utilize xylan as a carbon source, as witnessed from its inability to grow on xylan-supplemented minimal media. A simple two-step purification protocol taking advantage of the high pI (pH 9.5) of the extracellular enzyme resulted in an 11-fold purification with a final yield of 55%, equivalent to 1.9 mg of pure xylanase per liter of culture. Only one xylanase was detected for this organism. Low concentrations of salts (10 mm NaCl) were used throughout the purification procedure so as to prevent interaction between the enzyme and the xylan used for production. SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry indicated that the enzyme was >98% pure with a molecular mass of 45,982 Da. PCR screening allowed isolation of one clone containing a fragment of ∼11 kb. An open reading frame of 1278 bp encoding a protein of 426 amino acids was identified (Table I). Amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sequencing as well as analysis using the SignalP version 1.1 signal prediction program (36Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) indicated that the mature xylanase gene has a signal sequence of 21 amino acids and a predicted molecular mass of 45,981.81 Da, in good agreement with that determined by mass spectrometry.Table IPhysicochemical characteristics of the cold adapted xylanaseDNA sequence1278 bpMature protein sequence405 amino acidsSignal sequence21 amino acidsMolecular weight (sequence)45,981.81 DaMolecular weight (mass spectrometry)45,982.35 DaIsoelectric pointApproximately pH 9.5pH optimum (25 °C)pH 5.3–8pH stability range (25 °C)pH 6–9Temperature optimum (5 min assay)35 °CApparentT m (scan rate, 1 °C/min)aT m, melting temperature.53.5 °CΔH calbΔH cal, calorimetric enthalpy of unfolding.molar (scan rate, 1 °C/min)252.8 kcal/molΔH cal specific (scan rate, 1 °C/min)0.627 kcal/residueApparent K m(25 °C, soluble BWXcBWX, birchwood xylan.)28 ± 4.5 mg/mlApparent k cat (25 °C, soluble BWX)1247 ± 120 s−1Inhibitors (% inhibition at 1 mm)Hg2+(31%), Cu2+(16%), Zn2+(14%), Ni2+(6%)StereoselectivityInvertinga T m, melting temperature.b ΔH cal, calorimetric enthalpy of unfolding.c BWX, birchwood xylan. Open table in a new tab The deduced amino acid sequence shows highest identity to theBacillus halodurans xylanase Y (32.6%) with 24.7% identity to the family 8 chitosanase/lichenase of Bacillus circulans, 23.6% identity to the family 8 endoglucanase precursor of Clostridium thermocellum, and low identity to the other family 8 enzymes. Furthermore, a FingerPRINTScan against PRINTS using the InterPro Scan search program (37Zdobnov E.M. Apweiler R. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 847-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar) indicated that the isolated sequence contained the glycosyl hydrolase family 8 fingerprint. Sequence alignment (not shown) indicates that the proposed family 8 catalytic residues, glutamate and aspartate (38Guerin D.M. Lascombe M.B. Costabel M. Souchon H. Lamzin V. Beguin P. Alzari P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), are conserved in the isolated xylanase. Moreover, 8 residues are strictly conserved in the 20 family 8 enzymes (Glu-78, Trp-124, Ala-142, Asp-144, Ala-150, Ala-156, Trp-225, and Arg-284, cold-adapted xylanase numbering). In addition, two residues are strictly conserved in all enzymes except for the xylanases; one is replaced by a residue conserved within the xylanases (Glu-146 in xylanases-Asp), whereas the other is substituted by an unconserved residue (Val-121 or Tyr in xylanases-Leu). An unrooted evolutionary tree of family 8 members (see Fig.2) indicates that this family consists of six major subclasses. Subclasses A–C group endoglucanases from Gram-negative proteobacteria. Subclass A groups enzymes from bacteria belonging to the α-proteobacterial subdivision, whereas subclasses B and C group, respectively, enzymes from aerobes (E. coli, Salmonella, andPseudomonas) and facultative anaerobes (Erwiniaand Pectobacteria) belonging to the γ-proteobacterial subdivision. Subclass D contains xylanases from Gram-negative or -positive bacteria, whereas subclasses E and F contain enzymes from Gram-positive bacteria. Subclass E groups endo-1,4-glucanases from Clostridia (strict anaerobes) whereas subclass F groups endo-1,4-glucanases, lichenases, and chitosanases from Bacilli (aerobes and facultative anaerobes). Cloning of the xylanase gene, including its proper signal sequence, in a pET22b(+) vector in E. coli and cultivation in Terrific broth resulted in production of ∼85 mg of the enzyme per liter. The protein was purified with a procedure similar to that used for the wild-type enzyme; however, due to the absence of added xylan, no salt was required. An additional gel filtration step was also included, resulting in a final yield of 58 mg/liter and equivalent to a recovery of 68%. The enzyme has both a high molecular weight and a high pI (Table I). It has a wide pH activity range with maximum activity occurring between pH 5.3 and 8. While acknowledging the limitations of the test utilized for determination of the kinetic parameters, it can be seen that the apparentK m and k cat values of the cold xylanase at 25 °C are relatively high (2Beg Q.K. Kapoor M. Mahajan L. Hoondal G.S. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Heavy metals such as Hg2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Ni2+ were found to be inhibitory to activity, whereas Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, K+, PO 43− and Cl− as well as chelating agents (EDTA and EGTA) ha"

Poly-M shares with lipopolysaccharide the ability to stimulate cytokine production from human monocytes in a CD14-dependent manner. In the present study we examined the role of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 in responses to poly-M. Blocking antibodies to TLR2 and TLR4 partly inhibited tumor necrosis factor production induced by poly-M in human monocytes, and further inhibition was obtained by combining the antibodies. By transiently transfecting HEK293 cells, we found that membrane CD14 together with either TLR2 or TLR4/MD-2 could mediate activation by poly-M. Transfection of HEK293 cells with TLR2 and fluorescently labeled TLR4 followed by co-patching of TLR2 with an antibody revealed no association of these molecules on the plasma membrane. However, macrophages from the Tlr4 mutant C3H/HeJ mice and TLR4 knockout mice were completely non-responsive to poly-M, whereas the tumor necrosis factor release from TLR2 knockout macrophages was half of that seen with wild type cells. Taken together the results suggest that both TLR2 and TLR4 are involved in cell activation by poly-M and that TLR4 may be required in primary murine macrophages.

Draget K.I. Skjak-Braek G. Smidsrod O. Stephen A.M. Food Polysaccharides and Their Applications. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 245-286Google Scholar). In nature, alginate is found mainly as the structure substance of marine brown seaweed but also as an exopolysaccharide produced by bacteria, like the opportunistic pathogenPseudomonas aeruginosa that colonizes patients with cystic fibrosis (2May T.B. Shinabarger D. Maharaj R. Kato J. Chu L. DeVault J.D. Roychoudhury S. Zielinski N.A. Berry A. Rothmel R.K. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 4: 191-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and may cause severe infections in critically ill patients. Our group has previously shown that alginates are able to stimulate monocytes to cytokine production (3Otterlei M. Sundan A. Skjak-Braek G. Ryan L. Smidsrod O. Espevik T. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The potency increases with the content of M residues and molecular size, and polymers isolated from mucoid pseudomonads (poly-M, 92–96% M) are the most active (3Otterlei M. Sundan A. Skjak-Braek G. Ryan L. Smidsrod O. Espevik T. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1917-1925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, attaching oligomeric M blocks of low activity to particles enhances their TNF-inducing potency by 2–4 log units, suggesting that optimal immunostimulating activity is determined from the polymer conformation (4Berntzen G.

Ten human Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have been cloned, and some of them have been shown to be microbial signal transducers (for review, see Ref. 12Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: s1-s11Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The LPS hyporesponsiveness of C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice is due to a dominant negative point mutation and recessive null mutation, respectively, in Tlr4 (13Poltorak A., He, X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y.

Furthermore, TLR4 knockout (TLR4−/−) mice are non-responsive to LPS, whereas TLR2−/− mice respond normally (14Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J.

Recombinant human TNF (specific activity, 7.6 × 107 units/mg) was supplied by Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), and recombinant human IL-6 (specific activity, >1 × 108 units/mg) was purchased from Genzyme Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from human A+ buffy coats (The Bloodbank, RiT, Trondheim, Norway) by gradient centrifugation with Lymphoprep as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Adherent human monocytes (1–2 × 105 monocytes/well in 24-well dishes) were washed three times in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and pretreated with a 10 μg/ml concentration of the indicated mAbs or with 1 μg/ml synthetic lipid IVA (compound 406) for 30 min at room temperature in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 0.01% l-glutamine, 40 μg/ml gentamycin (referred to as RPMI hereafter) prior to addition of stimuli. Stimulation proceeded for 8 h at 37 °C before supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C until assayed for TNF activity in the WEHI 164 clone 13 bioassay as described previously (27Espevik T.

Subsequently the cells were incubated overnight with different stimuli in RPMI, 1% pooled human A+ serum. Supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C until assayed for IL-6 by the B9 cell proliferation assay (28Aarden L.A., De Groot E.R. Schaap O.L. Lansdorp P.M. Eur. J.

Transient transfection was performed using PolyFect® Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer's procedures (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cells were plated at a cell density of 2 × 104cells/well in 48-well dishes and incubated for 24–48 h. Cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and transfected in 200 μl of medium with 0.12 μg of the reporter plasmid pELAM-luc (29Chow J.C. Young D.W. Golenbock D.T. Christ W.J. Gusovsky F.

Kirschning, Technical University of Munich, Germany), pcDNA3-TLR4 (a gift from Drs. R. Medzhitov and C. Janeway, New Haven, CT), and/or pEFBOS-MD-2 (a gift from Dr. K. Miyake). pcDNA3 was used to adjust the amount of plasmid to a total of 0.6 μg. All plasmids were isolated using EndoFree plasmid kits (Qiagen). The next day cells were activated with poly-M (100 μg/ml), LPS K235 (0.1 μg/ml), or MALP-2 (10 nm) for 8–14 h at 37 °C. According to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI), cytoplasmic extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured by a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Results from duplicate wells are given as -fold induction of mean luciferase light units with reference to unstimulated cells transfected with the reporter plasmid plus MD-2. PCR of TLR4 was performed on pcDNA3-TLR4. The PCR fragments were digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned into pcDNA3 with YFP already inserted. The fluorescent pcDNA3 vectors were kindly provided by F. Chan and M. Lenardo (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The YFP-TLR4 construct produced functional and fluorescent TLR4 protein with C-terminal tagged YFP when transfected into HEK293 cells. The stable cell line of YFP-TLR4 in HEK293 was made by calcium phosphate transfection. Bulk populations of stably transfected cells were selected in 1 mg/ml G418 sulfate (BioWhittaker), and fluorescent cells were isolated using a fluorescence-activated cells sorter (BD Vantage, BD PharMingen). Several clonal cell lines were obtained by limiting dilution. The fluorescent HEK293 cell lines were cultivated in DMEM, 10% FCS with 0.5 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). Two days prior to transient transfection, the YFP-TLR4 cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were plated in 35-mm glass-bottom tissue culture dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). Cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and transfected in 100 μl with 200 ng each of pcDNA3-TLR2, pcDNA3-CD14, and pEFBOS-MD-2 with EffecteneTM Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer's procedure (Qiagen). Patching experiments were performed by adding 10 μg/ml TL2.1 or 10 μg/ml 3C10 in medium for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice before 10 μg/ml A647-labeled goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (Molecular Probes) were added. After 30–45 min at room temperature, the cells were examined live with an inverted Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope by use of 514 nm (YFP) and 633 nm (A647) lasers. To minimize bleeding between the channels the images were produced by performing single laser tracks. Peritoneal macrophages from C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice (Harlan Ltd., Oxon, UK) were collected by lavage 4 days after intraperitoneal injections of 3 ml of 3% thioglycollate (Difco, Detroit, MI). Macrophages were adhered (5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well dishes) for 2 h, washed, and incubated with stimuli in RPMI, 10% FCS for 8 h at 37 °C before supernatants were collected and stored at −20 °C until assayed for TNF activity in the WEHI 164 clone 13 bioassay as described previously (27Espevik T. Nissen-Meyer J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 95: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Results from one representative experiment are presented as mean ± S.D. of triplicate TNF measurements. Generation of the TLR2-deficient and TLR4-deficient mice has been described previously (14Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J.

C57BL/6 wild type, TLR2−/−, and TLR4−/− mice were intraperitoneally injected with 2 ml of 4% thioglycollate (Difco). Three days later, peritoneal exudate cells were isolated from the peritoneal cavity by washing with ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution. Cells were cultured for 2 h and washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution to remove non-adherent cells. Adherent monolayer cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were used as peritoneal macrophages and cultured in RPMI, 10% FCS in the presence of stimulants for 24 h. Supernatants were collected and assayed for TNF by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Genzyme Pharmaceuticals). Results from one representative experiment are presented as mean ± S.D. of triplicate TNF measurements. The U373 astrocytoma cell line does not express CD14, but the cells are responsive to LPS in the presence of serum as a source of soluble CD14 (9Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Bazil V. Espevik T. Finlay B.B. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). We have shown that although poly-M shares with LPS the ability to stimulate monocyte TNF production in a CD14-dependent manner (8Espevik T. Otterlei M. Skjak-Braek G. Ryan L. Wright S.D. Sundan A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and that serum or soluble CD14 enhances the response (10Jahr T.G. Ryan L. Sundan A. Lichenstein H.S. Skjak-Braek G. Espevik T. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 89-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), serum or soluble CD14 cannot support poly-M-induced IL-6 production from U373 cells (8Espevik T. Otterlei M. Skjak-Braek G. Ryan L. Wright S.D. Sundan A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To examine whether membrane CD14 is necessary for activation by poly-M, mock-transfected and CD14-transfected U373 cells were compared for responses to LPS and poly-M (Fig. 1 A). In the presence of 1% human serum, LPS induced dose-dependent IL-6 production from U373/CD14 cells that was 1–1.5 log units higher than that in non-transfected cells. Poly-M failed to activate U373 cells even when the cells were transfected with CD14 (Fig. 1 A). U373 cells did express endogenous TLR4, TLR6, and MD-2 but not TLR2 (reverse transcription-PCR data not shown). We next transiently transfected U373/CD14 cells with an ELAM-luciferase reporter plasmid together with combinations of TLR2, MD-2, and TLR4 and analyzed NF-κB activation by poly-M (Fig.1 B). Expression of TLR2 made U373/CD14 cells responsive to the TLR2-TLR6 ligand MALP-2 (24Takeuchi O. Kaufmann A. Grote K. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Morr M. Muhlradt P.F. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), confirming a functional TLR2. Similarly, overexpression of MD-2 and TLR4 resulted in increased NF-κB activation induced by LPS. However, none of the receptor combinations were sufficient for poly-M to induce NF-κB translocation in U373 cells. Thus, the results in Fig. 1 B demonstrate that the inability of poly-M to activate U373 cells was not due to the absence of TLR2 or low level expression of TLR4 or MD-2, suggesting that U373 cells lack other components needed for responses to poly-M. Altogether these results demonstrate that LPS and poly-M have different requirements for inducing cell activation. CD14 is involved in both LPS- and poly-M-induced monocyte TNF production (7Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C.

Immunol. 1993; 23: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but LPS signal transduction occurs through TLR4 in primary cells such as monocytes/macrophages (13Poltorak A., He, X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V., Du, X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B.

Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2800) Google Scholar). Blocking mAbs were used to examine the possible involvement of TLR2 and TLR4 in mediating poly-M-induced TNF production from monocytes. As shown in Fig2 A, mAbs to CD14 (3C10), TLR2 (TL2.1), and TLR4 (HTA125) all inhibited TNF production induced by poly-M, although with different efficiencies. From several experiments, inhibition by TL2.1 and HTA125 was 60–95% and 40–90%, respectively, but combinations of TL2.1 and HTA125 yielded greater inhibition than either mAb alone (Fig. 2 A and not shown). mAbs to CD14 and TLR4, but not to TLR2, blocked LPS-induced activation of monocytes (Fig. 2 B), and the control mAb, 6H8, did not influence stimulation by either LPS or poly-M (Fig. 2). Thus, poly-M and LPS share the involvement of CD14 and TLR4, but in addition poly-M uses TLR2 for inducing monocyte release of TNF. The activity of LPS is dependent on the nature and number of acyl chains in the lipid A part (30Seydel U. Wiese A. Schromm A.B. Brandenburg K. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 195-220Google Scholar), and some lipid A analogs antagonize LPS activation of human cells (30Seydel U. Wiese A. Schromm A.B. Brandenburg K. Brade H. Opal S.M. Vogel S.N. Morrison D.C. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 195-220Google Scholar). In other species, some of these molecules are agonists, and it has been demonstrated that TLR4 is responsible for the species-specific recognition of lipid A structures (31Lien E. Means T.K. Heine H. Yoshimura A. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Fenton M.J. Oikawa M. Qureshi N. Monks B. Finberg R.W. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2 C, synthetic lipid IVA (compound 406) inhibited both LPS- and poly-M-induced TNF production, supporting the results obtained with blocking mAbs that poly-M is recognized by TLR4. The stimulation of monocytes by poly-M was not due to contaminating LPS since polymyxin B, which binds to the lipid A part of LPS, inhibited activation by LPS and not by poly-M (Fig. 2 D). We next sought to delineate the minimum receptor requirement of poly-M-induced cell activation. HEK293 cells lacking CD14, TLR2, TLR4, and MD-2 (data not shown) were transiently transfected with combinations of these receptors together with an ELAM-luciferase reporter plasmid and analyzed for NF-κB activation by poly-M (Fig.3). HEK293 cells transfected with TLR2, TLR4, and/or MD-2 were unresponsive to poly-M unless membrane CD14 was expressed, indicating that, in contrast to LPS, soluble CD14 cannot substitute for the membrane-bound form in cell activation by poly-M (data not shown). HEK293 cells co-transfected with CD14 and TLR2 responded to poly-M with NF-κB activation, and MD-2 was not required for signaling (Fig. 3). The same pattern was observed for MALP-2. In contrast, expression of CD14 and TLR4 was not sufficient to mediate poly-M responses, and additional co-transfection with MD-2 was needed for poly-M to induce translocation of NF-κB (Fig. 3). Although we did not adjust for transfection efficiency, no obvious improvement of poly-M-induced NF-κB activation was obtained by co-transfection with TLR2 and TLR4 ± MD-2. MD-2 was also required together with TLR4 to signal LPS activation in HEK293 cells. These results indicate that poly-M can use either CD14/TLR2 or CD14/TLR4/MD-2 for signal transduction. Since poly-M was found to signal through both TLR2 and TLR4 with CD14 or CD14/MD-2 as co-receptors, respectively, we found it important to examine whether TLR2 and TLR4 co-localized on the plasma membrane in live cells. To perform these studies we engineered a TLR4 construct with YFP on the C terminus of the molecules. The fluorescent TLR4 was functionally active when transfected into HEK293 cells. 4E. Latz, A. Visintin, E. Lien, K. Fitzgerald, B. G. Monks, E. Kurt-Jones, D. Golenbock, and T. Espevik, unpublished data. TLR2 or CD14 was transiently transfected into HEK293 cells stably expressing YFP-TLR4 and patched with antibodies to TLR2 (TL2.1) and CD14 (3C10), respectively. As seen in Fig. 4,A–C, TLR4 did not accumulate in TLR2 patches, indicating that TLR2 and TLR4 are not preassociated on the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells. Incubation with poly-M to induce receptor complex formation or co-transfecting CD14 and MD-2 together with TLR2 did not change this pattern (data not shown). In contrast, patching of CD14 resulted in pronounced co-localization of TLR4 (Fig. 4,D–F), suggesting a close association between these two membrane molecules. Similar results were obtained when cells expressing YFP-TLR6 were transfected with TLR2 and patched with TL2.1 (data not shown). The importance of TLR4 in mediating LPS signaling was revealed by the finding that the genetic defect in LPS-hyporesponsive C3H/HeJ mice is a P712H missense mutation in Tlr4 (13Poltorak A., He, X.

Epididymal plasma contains the highest levels of l-carnitine found in the human body, and initiation of sperm motility occurs in parallel to l-carnitine increase in the epididymal lumen. Using a specific carrier, epididymal epithelium secretes l-carnitine into the lumen by an active transport mechanism; however, the structure-activity relationship comprising the carnitine-permeation pathway is poorly understood. We discovered a novel carnitine transporter (CT2) specifically located in human testis. Analyzing the primary structure of CT2 revealed that it is phylogenetically located between the organic cation transporter (OCT/OCTN) and anion transporter (OAT) families. Hence, CT2 represents a novel transporter family. When expressed in Xenopusoocytes, CT2 mediates the high affinity transport ofl-carnitine but does not accept mainstream OCT/OCTN cationic or OAT anionic substrates. We synthesized and tested various carnitine-related compounds and investigated the physicochemical properties of substrate recognition by semi-empirical computational chemistry. The data suggest that the quaternary ammonium cation bulkiness and relative hydrophobicity be the most important factors that trigger CT2-substrate interactions. Immunohistochemistry showed that the CT2 protein is located in the luminal membrane of epididymal epithelium and within the Sertoli cells of the testis. The identification of CT2 represents an interesting evolutionary link between OCT/OCTNs and OATs, as well as provides us with an important insight into the maturation of human spermatozoa. l-Carnitine is an essential component of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation and plays a pivotal role in the maturation of spermatozoa within the male reproductive tract.

In eukaryotic cells,l-carnitine is biologically important for mitochondrial β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids and to generate ATP (1Bremer J. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 1420-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic metabolism, a major function of l-carnitine is to promote the translocation of fatty acids across the mitochondrial inner membrane as β-hydroxyl O-acyl esters ofl-carnitine. Carnitine has been linked to the regulation of spermatozoa motility in several mammalian species. l-Carnitine is secreted from mammalian epithelium into epididymal plasma and ultimately into spermatozoa, where it accumulates as free and acetylatedl-carnitine (2Jeulin C. Lewin L.M. Hum. Reprod. Update. 1996; 2: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 3Jeulin C. Dacheux J.L. Soufir J.C. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1994; 100: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The concentration ofl-carnitine in epididymal plasma and spermatozoa range as high as 2–100 mm, 2000-fold higher than circulating blood levels (10–50 μm). Previous studies have shown that the role of l-carnitine in the epididymis is to foster fertilizing and maturation of spermatozoa (2Jeulin C. Lewin L.M. Hum. Reprod. Update. 1996; 2: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 4Hinton B.T. Snoswell A.M. Setchell B.P. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1979; 56: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Spermatozoa produced in testis are immobile and infertile and must undergo postgonadal modification in the epididymis to become fertile (2Jeulin C. Lewin L.M. Hum. Reprod. Update. 1996; 2: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Within the epididymal lumen, it has been shown that the initiation of sperm motility occurs in parallel with increase in l-carnitine (2Jeulin C. Lewin L.M. Hum. Reprod. Update. 1996; 2: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Regulated by androgens, previous studies using micropuncture andin vitro microperfusion demonstrate that the epididymal epithelium secrete l-carnitine into the epididymis lumen by a saturable process (2Jeulin C. Lewin L.M. Hum. Reprod. Update. 1996; 2: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 5Bohmer T. Johansen L. Int. J.

However, the molecular nature of the carnitine-specific transporter(s) in human epididymis is poorly understood. Molecular cloning techniques have led to considerable progress in the identification of various organic ion transporters. Organic ion transporters, located in various tissues, play important roles in the transport of a wide variety of structurally diverse xeno- and endobiotics. Koepsell et al. (8Koepsell H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and others identified the multispecific organic cation transporter (OCT)1 family. The OCT family mediates the excretion of diverse cationic substrates in tissues such as the kidney, intestine, placenta, and liver (7Gründemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H.

OCTNs are structurally similar to the OCT family and possess the ability to transport a variety of prototypical organic cations, such as tetraethylammonium cation (TEA), 1-methylphenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, and choline. Ubiquitously expressed in a wide variety of tissues, OCTN2 (16Wu X. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) is a member of the OCT/OCTN family and was initially described as accepting an assortment of organic cations; however, a study by Tamai et al. (18Tamai I. Ohashi R. Nezu J. Yabuuchi H. Oku A. Shimane M. Sai Y. Tsuji A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20378-20382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) has revealed that human OCTN2 mediates Na+-dependent transport ofl-carnitine. About the same time, we isolated OCTN2 cDNA from rat intestine (19Sekine T. Kusuhara H. Utsunomiya-Tate N. Tsuda M. Sugiyama Y. Kanai Y. Endou H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and found it to mediate the high affinity transport of l-carnitine. Consequently, we made a proposal for designating this transporter as “CT1” (for carnitine transporter 1) (19Sekine T. Kusuhara H. Utsunomiya-Tate N. Tsuda M. Sugiyama Y. Kanai Y. Endou H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Wu et al. (20Wu X. Huang W. Prasad P.D. Seth P. Rajan D.P. Leibach F.H. Chen J. Conway S.J. Ganapathy V. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 1482-1492PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that OCTN2 (CT1) mediate organic cations without involving Na+, whereas OCTN2 (CT1) could accept l-carnitine but only in the presence of extracellular Na+. However, a more rigorous investigation regarding the exact mechanism(s) of recognition for cationic and zwitterionic substrates has remained somewhat vague. We have identified and characterized a novel carnitine transporter, expressed exclusively in human testis, that we call CT2 (carnitine transporter 2). Compared with OCT/OCTN and OAT family members that have broad substrate specificity, CT2 has been unique because it displays substrate selectivity. We determined the subcellular localization of CT2 by immunohistochemistry. The CT2 protein was localized in the luminal membrane of human epididymis and supports the idea that CT2 constitutes an l-carnitine secretion mechanism from epididymal epithelium into the lumen. Therefore, the function of CT2 may be relevant in the maturation of human spermatozoa. At the level of amino acid sequence, CT2 is distinct from OCT/OCTN and OAT family members. We suggest that CT2 be a novel organic ion transporter family from which the OCT/OCTNs and OATs evolved. Our experimental and semi-empirical computational analyses (for a summary of structure-activity relationship descriptors, see Ref. 44CS CHEM3D 6.0 for Windows and Macintosh (5.0) User's Guide(2000) CambridgeSoft Corp., pp. 199–203, CambridgeSoft Corp., Cambridge, MA.Google Scholar) provide insight into the mechanism of carnitine recognition by CT2, and we have compared CT2 versus OCTN2 (CT1) substrate specificity.

The [32P]dCTP-labeled probe was synthesized from the clone (T7 Quick Prime, Amersham Biosciences) and was used to screen a human testis cDNA library. As described previously, a nondirectional cDNA library was prepared from the human testis poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH) with the SuperscriptTM Choice system (Invitrogen) (9Sekine T. Watanabe N.

Replicated filters of the phage library were hybridized overnight at 37 °C in a hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× standard saline citrate (SSC) (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 3× Denhardt's solution, 0.2% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.2 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm MES, and 0.01% Antifoam B, pH 6.5), and washed at 37 °C in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. The cDNA inserts (CT2) in positive λZipLox phages were recovered in the expression vector, pZL1 (Invitrogen), by in vivo excision. Sequence analyses and determination of genomic organization were performed with web-based data base searches through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov) and the DNASIS programs (Hitachi Software Engineering). Multiple sequence alignment and topology prediction were done with the DNASIS program. The phylogenetic analyses were performed with the CLUSTAL program (clustalw.genome.ad.jp/) and displayed with the TreeView drawtree program (taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html). As previously described, complementary RNA (cRNA) synthesis and uptake measurements were performed (9Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18526-18529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA was linearized with SpeI, and the cDNA insert transcribedin vitro with T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) in the presence of RNA cap analog (Amersham Biosciences). The resultant cRNA was purified by multiple phenol/chloroform extractions and precipitated with ethanol. Mature oocytes from Xenopus laevis (stages IV and V) were isolated by treatment with collagenase A (2.0 mg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Defolliculated oocytes were injected with 30–50 ng of capped CT2 cRNA and incubated at 18 °C in a modified Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.4 mmCaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm HEPES) containing gentamicin (50 μg/ml). After incubation for 2–3 days, uptake experiments were performed at room temperature in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The uptake experiment was initiated by replacing the ND96 solution with a solution containing radiolabeledl-carnitine (specific radioactivity, 2.22 TBq/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals) and was terminated by adding ice-cold ND96 buffer after 1 h of incubation. Oocytes were washed five times with ice-cold ND96 solution, solubilized with 10% SDS, and radioactivity content determined. The kinetic parameters for the uptake of l-carnitine via CT2 were estimated with the following equation: v =V max [S]/(K m + [S]), where v is the uptake rate of l-carnitine (picomol/oocyte/h), [S] is the substrate concentration (μm) in the medium, and K m is the Michaelis-Menten constant (μm). Inhibition constants (K i) were calculated as previously described (19Sekine T. Kusuhara H. Utsunomiya-Tate N. Tsuda M. Sugiyama Y. Kanai Y. Endou H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 586-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In Na+ substitution experiments, Na+ in ND96 bath was replaced iso-osmotically with equimolar Li+ orN-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG). For the inhibition study, uptake rate of 50 nm[3H]l-carnitine by oocytes injected with water or CT2 cRNA were measured for 1 h in the absence or presence of 5 or 50 μm test compound in ND96 solution. To examine trans-stimulatory effects on the efflux of radiolabeled substrates, CT2 expressed oocytes were incubated with [3H]l-carnitine (50 nm) for 90 min and transferred into the medium with or without unlabeledl-carnitine. The radioactivity in the medium and within the oocytes was determined after the 90-min incubation period. To test substrate recognition by CT2, we synthesized using known or slightly modified literature procedures (21Charles R. J. Org.

The vials were closed and heated (12 h; 90 °C). The solvent was removed to give oils that were crystallized from EtOAc: 2, 79%;3, 77%; 4, 53%; 5, 34%;6, 67%; 7, 64%; 8, 68%;9, 51%; 10, 82%; 11, 58%; and12, 60%. The ethyl esters (2-12) were converted to their carboxyl HCl analogs (2A–12A). Esters (1.0 g) in H2O (20 ml) and concentrated HCl (1 ml) were heated under reflux (6 h) and solvent removed under reduced pressure and recrystallized from EtOH. tert-Butyl alcohol (0.59 mol, 56 ml) and TEA (0.40 mol, 56 ml) were added to OEt2 (150 ml).trans-Crotyl chloride (90%, 0.38 mol, 40 ml) in OEt2 (20 ml) was added dropwise (1 h) and kept below 30 °C.

Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (electron ionization) m/z values were 143, 127, 69, and 57. The ester (0.18 mol, 25.2 g) was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (120 ml) and cooled in an ice bath. MCPBA (0.43 mol, 57 g) in CH2Cl2 (600 ml) was added dropwise (3.5 h) with stirring and placed into a refrigerator (4 °C, 4 days). The mixture was filtered and 10% sodium sulfite (500 ml) added and stirred (1 h). The organic phase was extracted with 5% NaHCO3 (200 ml), H2O (200 ml), and saturated NaCl (200 ml). The organic phase was dried, concentrated, and the yellow liquid vacuum distilled (0.4–0.5 mm Hg) to affordtert-butyl 3,4-epoxybutanoate (26 g, 0.16 mol, 52% yield). The epoxy-ester was used to prepare 3-hydroxyammoniobutylates. Epoxy-ester (0.013 mol, 2.1 g) in 30 ml of 70% EtOH was mixed with 1 eq of amine. The vessels were sealed and heated (60 °C) with stirring. After 24 h, the vials were cooled, concentrated, diluted with H2O (20 ml), and extracted with OEt2(2 × 20 ml). The aqueous layer was placed under vacuum (0.01 mm Hg; 3 day). The products were crystallized from hot, dry acetone, sealed and isolated by vacuum filtration, and dried under vacuum (0.01 mm Hg) to afford: 13, 44%; 14, 54%;15, 59%; and 16, 48%. 4-Pentenoic acid (0.20 mol, 20 g) in Me2SO (50 ml) was added to powdered KOH (0.299 mol, 16.8 g) in Me2SO (200 ml). Bromoethane (0.62 mol, 46 ml) was added by syringe transfer; a mildly exothermic reaction ensued. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 33 h, poured into H2O (800 ml), and extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 X 250 ml). The organic phase was concentrated and distilled under vacuum (7 mm Hg). The fraction boiling at 52–56 °C was collected to give 25.3 g of ethyl 4-pentenoate (93% yield). Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (electron ionization) m/z values were 128, 83, 55, and 45. The ester (0.198 mol) was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (500 ml), and MCPBA (0.39 mol, 52 g of 75% solid) in CH2Cl2 (150 ml) was added and mixture stirred and heated (50 °C) for 24 h.

A Compaq Deskpro EN computer with a Pentium III processor was used. Chemical structures were drawn with CS Chem-Draw Ultra® (version 6.0.1, Cambridge Soft Corp.) and copied into CS Chem3D Ultra® (version 6.0, Cambridge Soft Corp.). For each molecule, a molecular mechanics minimization was performed with a root-mean-square of 0.001. Gaussian 98W®(version 5.4, revision A.9) was installed, and molecular analyses were used to compute, at the semi-empirical Austin Model 1 level of theory set at “tight convergence setting,” optimized structures (25Frisch M.J.

Subsequently, optimization using Hartree-Fock/321G was performed set at “tight convergence” and theoretical atomic charges, electron density, and dipoles (Debye) were computed. Afterward, the property server (44CS CHEM3D 6.0 for Windows and Macintosh (5.0) User's Guide(2000) CambridgeSoft Corp., pp. 199–203, CambridgeSoft Corp., Cambridge, MA.Google Scholar) was used to compute ClogP and the Connolly accessible area (Å2). A human 16-lane, Multiple-Tissue Northern (MTNTM) blot (CLONTECH) was used for the Northern blot analysis of CT2. We used a [32P]dCTP-labeled CT2 cDNA fragment (877–1317) as the probe. According to the instructions from the manufacturer, the master blot filter was hybridized with the probe for 1 h at 65 °C. The filter was finally washed under a highly stringent condition (0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C). Corresponding to the 14 amino acids of the COOH terminus of CT2, we generated a rabbit anti-CT2 polyclonal antibody raised against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthesized peptide, KTEAITPRDSGLGE. The human testis or epididymal tissues were obtained from a patient who had died from bronchial asthma. As described previously, paraffin sections (3 μm) were processed for light microscopic immunohistochemical analysis (14Enomoto A. Kimura H. Chairoungdua A. Shigeta Y. Jutabha P. Cha S.H.

Regarding the absorption experiments, the tissue sections were treated with the primary antibody in the presence of antigen peptides (50 μg/ml). The experiments were performed using three different batches of oocytes, and the results from the experiments are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was judged from Student'st tests. Differences were considered significant at a level of p < 0.05. An EST data base search identified an EST (GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ accession number AA778598) exhibiting sequence similarity to rat OAT1 (9Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol.

As a result, a cDNA encoding a novel carnitine transporter (designated as CT2) was isolated. CT2 cDNA consisted of 2048 base pairs, had an open reading frame of 1632 base pairs, and included the termination codon. The open reading frame was flanked by a 284-bp-long 5′-noncoding sequence and a 132-bp-long 3′-noncoding sequence. The CT2 cDNA encoded a 543-amino acid protein.

The amino acid sequence of CT2 shows 36, 38, and 37% identities to human OAT1, OCT1, and OCTN2 (CT1), respectively. Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy plot analysis (29Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17297) Google Scholar) predicted 12 membrane-spanning domains in CT2 (Fig. 1, a andb), which are similar to other organic ion transporter family members. Analogously modeled to known mammalian transporters with 12 transmembrane domains, the CT2 amino and carboxyl termini were oriented toward the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.N-Glycosylation sites (residue 74) and protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation sites (residues 14, 142, 285, 322, 516, and 535) were also predicted in the CT2 sequence (Fig.1 a). Phylogenetic analysis with the CLUSTAL program revealed CT2 to exhibit remote similarity to each member of OCT/OCTNs and OATs (Fig. 2). Hence, CT2 could not be assigned to any of the known families and represents a novel organic solute transporter class.Figure 2CT2 represents a novel organic ion transporter family. The entire peptide sequences were aligned with the CLUSTAL algorithm (clustalw.genome.ad.jp/) (gap penalty, 5; open gap cost, 10; unit gap cost, 10), and the tree dendrogram was constructed with TreeView.

The gene is ∼50 kbp long and located on chromosome 6q21–22.1. The location was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization using CT2 cDNA as a probe (data not shown). Using the cloned CT2 cDNA with the reported genomic sequence, alignment of the nucleotide sequence enabled us to deduce the exon-intron gene organization. The CT2 gene consists of 10 exons and 9 introns (Fig. 3). The size of each exon, intron, and nucleotide sequence of the splice junctions is given in Table I.

https://openalex.org/W2027321140,"The agonist-stimulated release of arachidonic acid (AA) from cellular phospholipids in many cell types (e.g. myocytes, β-cells, and neurons) has been demonstrated to be primarily mediated by calcium-independent phospholipases A2 (iPLA2s) that are inhibited by the mechanism-based inhibitor (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one (BEL). Recently, the family of mammalian iPLA2s has been extended to include iPLA2γ, which previously could not be pharmacologically distinguished from iPLA2β. To determine whether iPLA2β or iPLA2γ (or both) were the enzymes responsible for arginine vasopressin (AVP)-induced AA release from A-10 cells, it became necessary to inhibit selectively iPLA2β and iPLA2γ in intact cells. We hypothesized that the R- and S-enantiomers of BEL would possess different inhibitory potencies for iPLA2β and iPLA2γ. Accordingly, racemic BEL was separated into its enantiomeric constituents by chiral high pressure liquid chromatography. Remarkably, (S)-BEL was approximately an order of magnitude more selective for iPLA2β in comparison to iPLA2γ. Conversely, (R)-BEL was approximately an order of magnitude more selective for iPLA2γ than iPLA2β. The AVP-induced liberation of AA from A-10 cells was selectively inhibited by (S)-BEL (IC50 ∼2 μm) but not (R)-BEL, demonstrating that the overwhelming majority of AA release is because of iPLA2β and not iPLA2γ activity. Furthermore, pretreatment of A-10 cells with (S)-BEL did not prevent AVP-induced MAPK phosphorylation or protein kinase C translocation. Finally, two different cell-permeable protein kinase C activators (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol) could not restore the ability of A-10 cells to release AA after exposure to (S)-BEL, thus supporting the downstream role of iPLA2β in AVP-induced AA release.

Finally, two different cell-permeable protein kinase C activators (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol) could not restore the ability of A-10 cells to release AA after exposure to (S)-BEL, thus supporting the downstream role of iPLA2β in AVP-induced AA release. calcium-independent phospholipase A2 arginine vasopressin (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one racemic (E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one (R)-(E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one (S)-(E)-6-(bromomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one (E)-6-(iodomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one cytosolic phospholipase A2 calcium-independent phospholipase A2β calcium-independent phospholipase A2γ phosphatidate phosphohydrolase phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 1,2-dioctanoyl-snglycerol arachidonic acid mitogen-activated protein kinase protein kinase C Dulbecco's modified Eagle' medium phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N′,N′-tetraacetic acid calmodulin 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid high pressure liquid chromatography diacylglycerol Calcium-independent phospholipases A2(iPLA2s)1constitute an important group of intracellular enzymes that function to hydrolyze esterified fatty acids from membrane phospholipids in response to agonist stimulation, changes in intracellular calcium ion homeostasis, and alterations in cellular energy requirements (for reviews see Refs. 1Gross R.W.

Based upon activity assays, calcium requirements, loss of arachidonylated phospholipid mass, and inhibition of iPLA2by rac-BEL, a diverse array of cellular processes has been proposed to be regulated by iPLA2s, including arachidonic acid (AA) release (10Lehman J.J.

Hypertension. 2000; 35: 249-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At present, three distinct subclasses of iPLA2 have been identified at the genetic level (with subsequent confirmation of iPLA2 catalytic activity by recombinant technologies) and have been designated iPLA2α, iPLA2β, and iPLA2γ, in order of their discovery (22Andrews D.L. Beames B. Summers M.D. Park W.D. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 23Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J. Biol.

The iPLA2s have been categorized based upon their strict conservation of nucleotide-binding (GXGXXG) and lipase (GXSTG) consensus sequences (Fig.1). Two of the iPLA2subclasses, iPLA2β and iPLA2γ, have been cloned from mammalian cDNA libraries, whereas the ortholog of iPLA2α (patatin), at the time of writing this paper (with 97.8% of the human genome sequenced), has not been identified in mammals. Calcium-independent phospholipase A2β contains eight ankyrin-repeat domains that are believed to facilitate intracellular sorting (23Tang J. Kriz R.W. Wolfman N. Shaffer M. Seehra J. Jones S.S. J.

The binding of CaM to iPLA2β results in inhibition of iPLA2β activity which is reversible through removal of Ca+2 and subsequent dissociation of CaM from the C terminus of iPLA2β (27Jenkins C.M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20989-20992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this paradigm, iPLA2β is regulated through alterations in cellular calcium ion homeostasis and becomes activated after dissociation from its complex with Ca+2/CaM when intracellular calcium stores are depleted by SERCA inhibitors, calcium-ionophores, or agonist stimulation (29Wolf M.J.

Gross, unpublished observations. and its mechanisms of regulation are unknown at present. Many prior studies of iPLA2 have utilized the mechanism-based suicide inhibitor rac-BEL as a pharmacologic tool to identify the type of intracellular phospholipase A2involved in many diverse cellular processes. Because rac-BEL inhibits both iPLA2β and iPLA2γ at low micromolar concentrations (24Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 36: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it is impossible to assign rac-BEL-mediated inhibition of AA release to iPLA2β or iPLA2γ activities. Accordingly, it became necessary to develop pharmacologic approaches that could discriminate between iPLA2β and iPLA2γ to facilitate identification of their biologic roles. In addition, it has been reported previously (33Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 34Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that high concentrations of BEL (25 μm) partially inhibit the magnesium-dependent cytosolic phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, PAP-1, which converts phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol (DAG). In those investigations, it was proposed that PAP-1 inhibition by BEL would prevent activation of protein kinase C leading to attenuated AA release. However, “rescue” experiments in which PKC was exogenously activated by phorbol esters or diacylglycerol analogs after BEL treatment were not reported by the authors to address their hypothesis (33Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 34Balboa M.A. Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7684-7690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In our early experiments we employed rac-BEL to demonstrate a 1000-fold selectivity between iPLA2versuscPLA2 and sPLA2 family members (31Hazen S.L. Zupan L.A. Weiss R.H. Getman D.P. Gross R.W. J.

Chem. 1993; 36: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Based upon the increasing appreciation of the utility of chiral pharmacologic agents in enhancing the specificity of inhibitors toward targeted biologic processes, we hypothesized that (R)- and (S)-BEL could differentially inhibit iPLA2β and iPLA2γ activities. Moreover, we reasoned that development of chiral mechanism-based inhibitors could provide an increased degree of discrimination between specific targeted enzyme systems and those of “nonspecific inhibition.” Here we report the resolution of racemic BEL into its individual enantiomeric constituents by chiral HPLC and the selective inhibition of iPLA2β by (S)-BEL and iPLA2γ by (R)-BEL, and we demonstrate that BEL-mediated inhibition of AA release in A-10 cells is likely mediated by iPLA2β and not due to inhibition of iPLA2γ or the effects of BEL on MAPK or PKC activation. BEL, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol (DOG) were obtained fromCalbiochem. A Chirex HPLC column composed of a stationary phase of (R)-phenylglycine linked through an amide linkage to 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid was purchased from Phenomenex. 3-Fold-crystallized α-chymotrypsin,N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (low endotoxin), antibodies against PKCα, and most other reagents were obtained from Sigma. AVP was purchased from Bachem. HPLC-grade organic solvents and channeled LK6D Silica Gel 60 Å thin layer chromatography plates (Whatman) were obtained from Fisher. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents and film were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.l-α-1-Palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonylphosphatidylcholine,l-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]oleoylphosphatidylcholine, [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-3H]arachidonic acid, andl-α-dipalmitoyl[U-glycerol-14C]phosphatidic acid were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A-10 cells derived from rat aortic smooth muscle were obtained from the ATCC and cultured as described previously (10Lehman J.J. Brown K.A. Ramanadham S. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20713-20716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). R- andS-enantiomers of (E)-6-(iodomethylene)-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-tetrahydropyran-2-one (αNpI6) were generous gifts of John A. Katzenellenbogen (University of Illinois, Urbana). Anti-active MAPK (pTEpY) and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies were obtained from Promega. Antibodies against PKCε and PKCδ were kindly provided by David A. Ford (St. Louis University, St. Louis). Antibodies against PKCι were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories. Recombinant iPLA2β was expressed and purified from Sf9 cells as described previously (35Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30879-30885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recombinant full-length iPLA2γ was expressed in Sf9 cells, and the membrane fraction was washed and isolated as described previously (24Mancuso D.J. Jenkins C.M. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9937-9945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). BEL enantiomers were resolved by HPLC utilizing a Chirex column of 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl-(R)-phenylglycine attached to a silica matrix as the stationary chiral phase. The chiral column was equilibrated with hexane/dichloroethane/ethanol (150:15:1), and optical enantiomers were eluted isocratically at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Elution of BEL racemates from the column was monitored by UV absorbance at 280 nm. Peaks corresponding to the R- andS-enantiomers were collected, dried under N2, and stored at −20 °C. The concentration of BEL for each experiment was determined spectrophotometrically based on UV absorbance (ε280 = 6130 cm−1m−1 in acetonitrile). The kinetics of α-chymotrypsin inactivation by (R)-, (S)-, and rac-BEL were performed similar to methods described previously (36Baek D.-J. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The concentration of α-chymotrypsin (Mr = 25,000) was determined using an A1% = 20 (1-cm path length) at 280 nm (37Dixon G.H. Neurath H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 225: 1049-1059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of α-chymotrypsin (2 μm) was incubated with up to a 5-fold molar excess of (R)-, (S)-, or rac-BEL dissolved in acetonitrile or vehicle alone for 5 min at 22 °C in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. A 10-μl aliquot of the reaction was diluted 1000-fold in 10 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 100 mm hydrazine to deacylate transiently inactive BEL-chymotrypsin complexes. Following incubation at 22 °C for 1 h, chymotrypsin activity in each diluted sample was measured utilizing a SPECTRAmax GeminiXS microplate spectrofluorometer withN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (50 μm) as substrate for 1 min at 25 °C. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 380 and 460 nm, respectively. Purified recombinant iPLA2β or Sf9 cell membranes containing recombinant iPLA2γ were incubated with (R)-BEL, (S)-BEL, racemic BEL, or ethanol vehicle for 3 min at 22 °C in the presence of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 4 mm EGTA (for iPLA2β) or 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, and 4 mm EGTA (for iPLA2γ). The concentration of BEL used for each experiment ranged from 0 to 16 μm.l-α-1-Palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonylphosphatidylcholine (5 μm final concentration) orl-α-1-palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]oleoylphosphatidylcholine (5 μm final concentration) in ethanol was then added to each sample and incubated at 37 °C for 2 min. Reactions were terminated by extraction of radiolabeled products into butanol, and reactants and products were separated by thin layer chromatography using Whatman LK6D 60-Å Silica Gel plates with petroleum ether/ethyl ether/acetic acid (70:30:1) as the mobile phase. Regions corresponding to the migration of a fatty acid standard visualized by iodine staining were scraped into vials, and radioactivity was quantified by scintillation spectrometry. Rat aortic smooth muscle A-10 cells, cultured in 60-mm dishes (2.5 × 105 cells/dish), were radiolabeled with 0.5 μCi of [3H]arachidonic acid per dish as described previously (29Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once with DMEM containing 0.25% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin followed by two washes with DMEM alone. Cells were then incubated with the indicated concentrations of (R)-, (S)-, rac-BEL, or ethanol vehicle (0.1% final concentration) in DMEM for 20 min. This medium was removed, and the cells were then incubated with DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in the absence or presence of 1 μm AVP. In some experiments, PMA (1 μm) or DOG (10 μm) was added to the medium containing AVP. After 5 min, 1 ml of this medium was removed; lipids were extracted into 2 ml of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (25:24:1, v/v) (38Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42878) Google Scholar), and the remaining cells were scraped into 1 ml of deionized water prior to lipid extraction as described above. The chloroform layer was evaporated under nitrogen, and the extracted lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl ether/glacial acetic acid, 70:30:1). Regions containing fatty acids and phospholipids were scraped into vials, and radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. A-10 cells were grown to confluency, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.25m sucrose and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol). After brief sonication utilizing a Vibra-Cell VC40 sonicator (5 times with 1-s pulses at 30% power), the lysed cell suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate cytosolic and membrane fractions. In some experiments, A-10 cells were washed and pretreated with BEL or ethanol vehicle (as described above for experiments examining [3H]AA liberation) before isolation of cell homogenates. Each fraction (40 μl) was preincubated with BEL (up to 200 μm) or ethanol vehicle at 22 °C for 5 min in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA (90 μl final volume). Dipalmitoylphosphatidic acid (100 μm final concentration containing 0.05 μCi ofl-α-dipalmitoyl[U-glycerol-14C]phosphatidic acid per reaction in the presence of 1 mm Triton X-100) was added to each reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 5–10 min. Reactions were terminated with 900 μl of 5% acetic acid and extracted into chloroform by the method of Bligh and Dyer (38Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 31: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42878) Google Scholar) prior to separating dipalmitoylglycerol by TLC utilizing chloroform/methanol/water (65:35:2) as the mobile phase prior to quantification by scintillation spectrometry. Confluent A-10 cells in 10-cm dishes were incubated overnight in the presence of DMEM containing 1% fetal bovine serum to reduce background phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2. Cells were washed twice with DMEM without serum and preincubated with 5 μm (R)-BEL, (S)-BEL, rac-BEL, or ethanol vehicle in DMEM without serum for 15 min at 37 °C. This medium was then removed, and the cells were incubated with 1 μm AVP for 5 min at 37 °C. After washing once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were scraped into RIPA buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate), incubated on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentrations of the sample supernatants were determined utilizing the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Samples were electrophoresed according to the method of Laemmli (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroelution in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, for ECL Western analysis. After blocking with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% non-fat dry milk for 2 h, primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphorylated (pTEpY) and dephosphorylated MAPK diluted 1:5000 in PBS containing 5% BSA were incubated with the blot for 1 h. After washing with TBS-T, the blots were incubated with ice-cold PBS containing 0.25% glutaraldehyde for 15 min as described previously (40Ikegaki N. Kennett R.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 124: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), washed, and incubated with a protein A-peroxidase conjugate diluted (1:5000) in TBS-T containing 5% BSA for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Confluent A-10 cells in 10-cm dishes were washed twice with DMEM without serum, followed by incubation with either 5 μm (S)-BEL or ethanol vehicle in DMEM for 15 min at 37 °C. This medium was then removed, and DMEM with or without 1 μm AVP was incubated with the cells for 5 min. After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were collected by scraping into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.33 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin and were lysed by three cycles of flash freezing with liquid nitrogen and thawing. Each sample was then further homogenized utilizing a Teflon homogenizer before isolating the low speed pellet (1,000 × g), membrane (100,000 × gpellet), and cytosol (100,000 × g supernatant) fractions. The protein concentrations of the fractions were determined utilizing the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce) with BSA as a standard. Samples were electrophoresed and subjected to ECL Western analysis utilizing rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PKCα and PKCε as described above for MAPK phosphorylation. For blots incubated with mouse monoclonal antibodies against PKCδ and PKCι, an anti-mouse IgG (Fab-specific)-peroxidase conjugate was utilized in place of the protein A-peroxidase conjugate. Because BEL contains a chiral center at C-2 (Fig. 2), we hypothesized that (R)-BEL and (S)-BEL might have different potencies and/or selectivities for iPLA2β and iPLA2γ so that individual enantiomers of BEL could be exploited to identify the roles of iPLA2β and iPLA2γ in agonist-stimulated AA release in intact cells. Accordingly, a chiral HPLC column was used to separate (R)-BEL and (S)-BEL from rac-BEL (Fig. 2). Separation of the BEL enantiomers under the conditions employed resulted in resolution of two major UV-absorbing peaks with anRT difference of ∼2 min. The first peak eluted at 18.8 min (Peak A), and the second peak eluted at 20.5 min (Peak B) (relative retention time (RRT) Peak A/Peak B = 0.917) (Fig. 2). Integration of the areas of each peak was identical (within 1%), suggesting that the enantiomers of BEL had been separated. Proton NMR data demonstrated peaks with the anticipated chemical shifts and coupling constants as described previously (data not shown) (41Daniels S.B. Cooney E. Sofia M.J. Chakravarty P.K. Katzenellenbogen J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15046-15053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometric analysis of the material in each peak revealed the presence of a lithiated doublet at 323.3 and 325.3 daltons (consistent with the presence of a bromine atom) which was of equal intensity for each moiety. Re-injection of Peak A or Peak B onto the chiral column demonstrated that each purified moiety eluted at its previous retention time with negligible amounts of contaminating material demonstrating that, as expected, no equilibration had occurred. Finally, both peaks co-eluted utilizing a non-chiral C18 HPLC column (data not shown). To determine the absolute chirality of the resolved BEL enantiomers, synthetic enantiomers of αNpI6 of known chirality were chromatographed separately and together on the chiral stationary phase. Under these conditions, (S)-αNpI6 (RT = 19.5 min) eluted prior to (R)-αNpI6 (RT = 21.4 min) with approximately the same degree of separation (RRT = 0.911) as the BEL enantiomers. Chymotrypsin has been identified previously as a suitable target for aromatic haloenol lactones resulting in its mechanism-based inhibition as detailed by careful kinetic analyses by Katzenellenbogen (41Daniels S.B.

GPIb binds to the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor (vWF-A1) at high blood shear, initiating platelet adhesion and contributing to the formation of a thrombus. To investigate the molecular basis of GPIb regulation and ligand binding, we have determined the structure of the N-terminal domain of the GPIbα chain (residues 1–279). This structure is the first determined from the cell adhesion/signaling class of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins and reveals the topology of the characteristic disulfide-bonded flanking regions. The fold consists of an N-terminal β-hairpin, eight leucine-rich repeats, a disulfide-bonded loop, and a C-terminal anionic region. The structure also demonstrates a novel LRR motif in the form of an M-shaped arrangement of three tandem β-turns. Negatively charged binding surfaces on the LRR concave face and anionic region indicate two-step binding kinetics to vWF-A1, which can be regulated by an unmasking mechanism involving conformational change of a key loop. Using molecular docking of the GPIb and vWF-A1 crystal structures, we were also able to model the GPIb·vWF-A1 complex.

Ib·V·IX complex is a platelet membrane receptor complex with a critical role in adhesion to the damaged vessel wall under conditions of high shear stress (1Nurden A.T. Caen J.P. Nature. 1975; 255: 720-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Platelets are gradually slowed, and subsequently, integrins are activated by repeated interactions of GPIb-V-IX with von Willebrand factor (vWf) bound to the subendothelium. The GPIb-V-IX complex contains four subunits, GPIbα, GPIbβ, GPIX, and GPV, each with an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane helix, and short cytoplasmic tails. The most important component of the GP Ib-V-IX complex in terms of mass and functional sites is the 150-kDa GPIbα chain with binding sites for the vWF-A1 domain and thrombin in its extracellular N-terminal domain and binding sites for filamin and 14–3-3ζ in its cytoplasmic domain. Mutations in GPIb result in the congenital bleeding disorders, Bernard Soulier syndrome (BSS), and platelet-type von Willebrand disease (Pt-vWD). Several informative BSS point mutations result in an expressed GPIb receptor deficient in vWF binding, whereas the Pt-vWD point mutations produce a hyperactivated receptor. In addition, von Willebrand disease type IIb point mutations in the vWF-A1 domain also produce high affinity binding by inducing conformational changes in the A1 domain. Although the principal ligand for GPIbα is vWf (1Nurden A.T. Caen J.P. Nature. 1975; 255: 720-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 2Coller B.S. Peerschke E.I. Scudder L.E. Sullivan C.A.

Proteolysis of GPIbα yields a 40–45-kDa N-terminal domain containing binding sites for all the principal ligands (4Wicki A.N. Clemetson K.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 153: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Studies on the mechanism of GPIbα-vWf interactions are complicated by the fact that the two molecules do not normally interact under static conditions but only under shear stress (10Fredrickson B.J.

Blood. 1987; 69: 625-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several techniques have been used to induce interactions between these proteins including ristocetin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic (12Howard M.A. Firkin B.G. Thromb. Diath.

GPIbα is a member of the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) family (14Lopez J.A. Chung D.W. Fujikawa K. Hagen F.S. Papayannopoulou T. Roth G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). LRRs are typically 22–28 amino acids long and occur in tandem repeats that are commonly flanked by conserved disulfide loop structures (17Hess D. Schaller J. Rickli E.E. Clemetson K.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The GPIbα N-terminal flank, LRRs, and C-terminal flanking anionic region have all been implicated in contributing to the vWF binding site (18Cauwenberghs N. Vanhoorelbeke K. Vauterin S. Westra D.F.

The anionic region includes three tyrosine residues (Tyr-276, Tyr-278, and Tyr-279) that are post-translationally sulfated in the native receptor, and this modification has been shown to be essential for binding to vWf and thrombin (20Dong J., Ye, P.

We have previously determined the crystal structure of the A1 domain of vWf containing the binding site for GPIbα (22Cruz M.A. Handin R.I. Wise R.J. J. Biol.

To investigate further the molecular basis of the GPIbα·vWF interaction, we now report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of the GPIbα chain. The GPIbα N-terminal domain was prepared from platelets and in recombinant form. Glycocalicin, the GPIbα extracellular domain, was isolated and purified from platelets as described previously (24Jandrot-Perrus M. Clemetson K.J. Huisse M.G. Guillin M.C. Blood. 1992; 80: 2781-2786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was cleaved to generate the N-terminal 45-kDa region (amino acids 1–288) and macroglycopeptide using 1:250 w/w Lys-C endoprotease treatment for 24 h at 4 °C. The N-terminal domain was separated from the macroglycopeptide by linear salt gradient (0.2–1 m) on a Mono Q column equilibrated with 25 mm Tris 7.5, 0.2m NaCl. DNA corresponding to the GPIbα signal peptide and residues 1–291 was amplified by PCR and cloned into expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen), which had been modified to incorporate a C-terminal V5-His tag. This DNA was transfected into cultured cv-1 cells. The cv-1 monolayer secreted recombinant tagged GPIbα, and the medium was harvested at 14-day intervals. GPIbα was purified by precipitation at 80% (NH4)2SO4, and the pellet was dissolved in and dialyzed against 0.2 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 and centrifuged for 20 min at 50,000 × g. This material was applied to a Q column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with the same buffer and was eluted using a linear salt gradient. The resulting fractions were pooled and applied to a Ni2+-chelating Sepharose column (AmershamBiosciences) in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5m NaCl. GPIbα was eluted using an imidazole gradient and gave a single 45-kDa band on an SDS-PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Blue. The protein concentration was estimated, the V5-His tag was cleaved off with Lys-C as described above, and the solution concentrated to 6–10 mg/ml. Crystallization experiments were performed at 20 °C using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method, and needle crystals grew under conditions of 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.5, 2m (NH4)2SO4 over a period of 2 weeks using both platelet and recombinant GPIbα. Crystals of 100 × 100 × 400 μm were transferred into a cryoprotecting solution of 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.5, 2.2m (NH4)2SO4, 30% glycerol and were flash-frozen in a cryostream of nitrogen at a temperature of 100° K. The native and heavy atom data sets described in Table I were collected on station ID14–4 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The crystals adopt space group p6422 with cell dimensions a = 202.1 Å,b = 202.1 Å, c = 128.0 Å, α = 90°, β = 90°, and γ = 120°.

Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The resulting 3.5-Å phases had a 0.56 mean figure of merit. The phases were solvent-flattened (program DM, CCP4 suite) using a 50% solvent content, and the electron density showed clearly recognizable features of the GPIbα LRRs. Improved density was observed for space group p6422 (over enantiomorphic p6222) and revealed two GPIbα molecules in the asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 73%. These phases were applied to the 2.8-Å di-iodobis (ethylened iamine) diplatinum (II)nitrate structure factors, and using 2-fold molecular averaging and solvent flattening, the multiple isomorphous replacement phases were improved and extended to 2.8 Å. The resulting map was of sufficient quality to model 90% of the structure (program XtalView) (30Dong J. Schade A.J. Romo G.M. Andrews R.K. Gao S. McIntire L.V. Lopez J.A. J. Biol.

A 2F o −F c electron density map calculated at 2.8 Å was of high quality with additional side chain and main chain density observable. Several rounds of model building and refinement using CNS (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J.

Individual B-factors were refined, and the addition of 166 water molecules gave a final RWORK of 0.245 and RFREEof 0.279 (5.0% of the reflections). The average temperature factors for protein atoms are 49.2 and 42.3 Å2 for solvent atoms. Electron density is observed for GPIbα residues Pro-2 to Pro-280 in molecule A and Pro-2 to Thr-266 in molecule B with 99.8% of residues in allowable regions of the Ramachandran plot (67% of residue 304 in most favored regions and 32.8% of residue 163 in additional allowed regions). Residue Tyr-44 is in a disallowed region of the plot, but inspection of the electron density shows that this residue is well defined and has a stabilizing hydrogen bond.N-Acetylglucosamine residues are observed in the electron density connected to the glycosylation sites of Asn-21 and Asn-159. Additional oligosaccharide residues appear to be disordered. The model also includes one free sulfate ion and three sulfated tyrosine residues. We expressed residues 1–288 from human GPIbα in simian cv-1 cells and the resulting purified protein crystallized in space group p6422. Isomorphous crystals grow from the same GPIbα fragment generated by proteolysis of glycocalicin isolated from platelets. The structure was determined to 2.8 Å using four heavy atom derivatives (TableI) and refined to an R-factor of 24.5% (RFREE 27.6%) with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The GPIbα-fold consists of an N-terminal β-hairpin (residues 2–18), eight LRRs-(19–204), a disulfide knot structure (amino acids 205–264), and a C-terminal anionic region (amino acids 265–280) (Fig. 1). The N-terminal β-hairpin has two anti-parallel strands with a disulfide (C4–C17) bridge at the base. The second β-strand joins the convex parallel β-sheet in a configuration very similar to the spliceosomal complex subunit U2A′, which has only five LRRs (27Price S.R. Evans P.R. Nagai K. Nature. 1998; 394: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The two β-strands present on the concave face of the GPIbα LRRs 3 and 4 are also present in U2A′. The eight LRRs fold into a characteristic arc shape with a parallel β-sheet on the concave face. Previous sequence comparisons and/or models suggested that GPIbα contains seven LRRs and not the eight found here. This discrepancy is the result of the earlier definition of the sequence of an LRR, which left an overhanging sequence at each end as “flanking sequences.” By changing the start and end sites of the LRR, these sequences are incorporated into the structure as an additional repeat. The convex face of LRRs 5, 6, 7, and 8 each has a novel LRR motif consisting of a tandem arrangement of three β-turns. They form a flattish amphipathic structure with the main chain hydrogen bonds in a linear arrangement (Fig.2). The consensus for this motif is PXGLLXGL with leucine side chains projecting into the hydrophobic core. Adjacent β-turn repeat motifs form a regular parallel packing arrangement with the core leucine residues pointing alternately in and out of the plane of the structure interlocking with the corresponding leucines from the adjacent repeat. The LRR8 β-turn repeat motif has two phenylalanine residues in place of leucines in the central β-turn. These bulkier side chains serve to fill the gap between the end of the LRRs and the core of the C-terminal flank by packing against Phe-232 and Trp-235 from helix α1. It is unclear why the up and down repeating β-turn motif found here is not a more common secondary structural element. It is possible that the flattened structure is appropriate for packing in the LRR-fold but would be less stable in other contexts.Figure 2Structure of the β turn repeat motif. a, superposition of residues from LRR5-(116–123), LRR6-(140–147), LRR7-(164–171), LRR8-(188–195) shown as a stereo plot. b, ball andstick illustration of residues 164–171 from the concave face of LRR7 with main chain hydrogen bonds represented as dotted blue lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The GPIbα C-terminal flanking sequence contains two disulfide bonds, C209–C248 and C211–C264, an α-helix (residues 214–223), and a loop (residues 227–242), which extends over the interior of the GPIbα LRR concave face (termed the regulatory or R-loop in Fig3, a and b). Initially, the structure continues to follow a circular coil similar to the LRRs with helix α1 lying parallel to the β-turn repeats of the concave face. Following helix α1 comes the triangular-shaped R-loop, two short 310 helices set at right angles, and a further loop (residues 251–264) extending to Cys-264. The structure of residues 269–279 from the C-terminal anionic region is illustrated in Fig. 3 c. These residues are well defined in the electron density of one GPIbα molecule but are disordered in the second molecule. The anionic region extends outwards from Cys-264 with Asp-269 to Asp-272 resembling a hinge that turns through 180° and is followed by residues Asp-274 to Asp-277, which form a single α-helical turn. The carboxyl group of Asp-274 forms helix-capping hydrogen bonds to Tyr-276 and Asp-274 main chain nitrogen atoms, and the Asp-277 carboxyl forms a hydrogen bond to the Tyr-274 main chain. Tyrosine residues 276, 278, and 279 are post-translationally sulfated. Interactions with the convex face of LRR8 and C-terminal flank occur through the Tyr-278 and Tyr-279 sulfate groups respectively. The Tyr-278 sulfate moiety forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain nitrogen of Gly-190, and similarly, the Lys-189 side chain nitrogen makes a hydrogen bond to the Tyr-278 main chain carbonyl. The Tyr-279 sulfate forms salt bridges with the Arg-217 and Arg-218 guanidinium groups from helix α1. The Tyr-276 sulfate forms adventitious hydrogen bonding interactions with Asn-59 and Asn-61 from a symmetry-related molecule. The interaction of the anionic region with the main body of GPIbα structure buries a small surface area, and in solution, this structure may be in equilibrium with a more extended conformation through flexibility around the Asp-269 to Asp-272 hinge. The alignment of the human, canine, and murine GPIbα sequences (Fig.4) shows poor conservation within the anionic region. Only Asp-272, Asp-274, Tyr-276, and Asp-277 are absolutely conserved with deletions occurring on either side of this sequence in the alignment. This is consistent with the Asp-272 to Asp-277 helix representing a conserved structure with short sequences on either side, possibly acting as flexible hinges connecting to the GPIbα LRRs and the membrane proximal macroglycopeptide. The GPIbα structure reveals a large patch of negatively charged amino acids (Glu-14, Asp-18, Glu-40, Asp-63, Asp-83, Asp-106, Glu-128, Glu-151, and Asp-175) across the concave surface formed by the LRRs and the contiguous β-strands of the N-terminal hairpin, which indicates a possible binding surface for interaction with vWF-A1. Although only a few examples of structures of the LRR domain complexes with ligands have been determined (18Cauwenberghs N. Vanhoorelbeke K. Vauterin S. Westra D.F. Romo G. Huizinga E.G. Lopez J.A. Berndt M.C. Harsfalvi J. Deckmyn H. Blood. 2001; 98: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Price S.R. Evans P.R. Nagai K. Nature. 1998; 394: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), the binding site involves the concave face β-sheet of the LRRs that is either positively or negatively charged. The view of the GPIbα structure shown in Fig. 5 resembles the profile of an open hand with the R-loop forming the thumb, which extends over the “palm” region of the LRR concave face, leaving a 20-Å aperture to the tips of the fingers. The 45 × 40 × 30-Å dimensions of the vWF-A1 structure (11Peterson D.M. Stathopoulos N.A. Giorgio T.D. Hellums J.D. Moake J.L. Blood. 1987; 69: 625-628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that this globular domain cannot contact the ligand binding surface on the palm of GPIbα because of steric hindrance from the thumb. We propose that the GPIbα crystal structure represents the low affinity or “closed” form of the receptor and that a conformational change in the thumb is required to unmask the A1 domain binding site. The structure of the high affinity or “open” form could either involve the thumb folding back partially and participating in an extended concave-shaped vWf-A1 binding site or, alternatively, a simple removal of the steric constraint. If the R-loop is removed from the GPIbα structure, the A1 domain can be satisfactorily docked against the concave surface. BSS point mutations causing loss of vWF binding localize to the general area around the concave face β-strands from LRRs 5, 6, and 7 (L129P, A156V, and L179del) and also the sides of LRR2 (C65R and L57F) (Fig.1). These mutations are all buried hydrophobic core residues with the exception of Ala-156, which lies on the surface of the concave face partially buried by surrounding side chains and the R-loop. Pt-vWD mutations G233V (28Miller J.L. Lyle V.A. Cunningham D. Blood. 1992; 79: 439-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and M239V (29Russell S.D. Roth G.J. Blood. 1993; 81: 1787-1791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which activate the receptor, lie on the outer tips of the triangular R-loop and presumably act by favoring a more open conformation of the receptor (Fig. 3, aand b). Further “activating” mutations D235V and K237V (30Dong J. Schade A.J. Romo G.M. Andrews R.K. Gao S. McIntire L.V. Lopez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27663-27670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis studies in the region of the R-loop. Further support for an unmasking mechanism comes from antibody 24G10 that inhibits vWf binding and maps to GPIbα residues 1–81 (20Dong J., Ye, P. Schade A.J. Gao S. Romo G.M. Turner N.T. McIntire L.V. Lopez J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16690-16694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This antibody binds to the Pt-vWd GPIbα mutants with increased affinity, indicating that it overlaps with a vWF-A1 binding site that is regulated by the conformation of the R-loop. Coordinates from the GPIbα structure (R-loop removed) and the vWf-A1 von Willebrand disease type IIb mutation structure (31Celikel R. Ruggeri Z.M. Varughese K.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 881-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (residues 499–701) were docked together using the automated search program FTDOCK (32Gabb H.A. Jackson R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). 2The highest scoring complex with an RPscore of 5.4 was used (32Gabb H.A. Jackson R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 106-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). This model was manually adjusted to optimize side chain interactions and remove steric conflicts using XtalView (33McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). The R-loop was then modeled back into the complex structure lying to one side of the A1 interface. In this model, loops from the top of the A1 domain-fold are oriented toward the GPIbα N-terminal β-hairpin with further extensive interactions formed down the full-length of the GPIbα LRR concave face β-strands (Fig. 6, a and b). Loops from the top of the A1 domain contribute basic residues Arg-524, Arg-629, Arg-632, which form salt bridges with Glu-14, Glu-40, and Asp-83, respectively. His-656 of A1 also forms a hydrogen bond to the main chain carbonyl from Lys-8. Gln-590 hydrogen bonds to Tyr-58/Gln-59, and Gln-628 forms a hydrogen bond to Glu-40. At the center of the interface, residues Asp-560 and Glu-596 A1 form salt bridges with Lys-152 and Lys-132 GPIbα and His-559, and His-563 of A1 forms hydrogen bonds to Glu-128 and Glu-175 of GPIbα, respectively. The Asp-560 main chain carbonyl also forms a key hydrogen bond to the side chain nitrogen group of Lys-152. Toward the bottom of the interface Phe-603, Tyr-637 A1 packs against the hydrophobic residues Trp-230, Phe-199, and Phe-201 GPIbα, and Gln-604 and Ser-607 of A1 form hydrogen bonds to the Val-299 main chain nitrogen and Asn-242 GPIbα side chain, respectively. In the GPIbα structure, the C-terminal anionic region is located ∼50 Å from the center of the LRR concave face, indicating that this forms a distinct binding site for vWF-A1. The model in Fig. 6,a and c, illustrates that an extended form of the anionic peptide with the Asp-274 to Asp-277 helix intact can act in concert with the GPIbα concave face to engage a single vWF-A1 domain. In this model the helical arrangement of three sulfate groups from GPIbα residues, Tyr-276, Tyr-278, and Tyr-279, form interactions with four basic residues, Lys-569, Arg-571, Lys-572, and Arg-573 from A1. The overall model is consistent with the reported 1:1 stoichiometry for the GPIbα-A1 interaction. All A1 domain residues described in this model have been implicated by mutagenesis in binding to GPIbα with the exception of Phe-693 and Gln-628, which have yet to be studied (34Matsushita T. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13406-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 35Kroner P.A. Frey A.B.

Furthermore, as discussed in the previous sections, there are corroborative data confirming the involvement of the GPIbα LRRs and the anionic region in interactions with vWF-A1. The model has a similar architecture to the crystal structure of the spliceosomal U1A′·U2B“ protein complex in that the α/β-fold of the U2B” domain binds the concave face of the U1A′ LRRs. The model of the complex provides a rationale for the affinity differences observed for BSS and Pt-vWD GpIbα mutants and also between the wild type and activated type IIb mutant vWF-A1. In the latter case, as residue Asp-560 A1 is buried at the center of the complex interface, the small conformational differences in this residue observed between the wild type and type IIb mutant crystal structures (31Celikel R.

Because the respiratory chain produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can mediate intracellular signal cascades, we addressed the possibility that ROS are involved in hypoxic gene induction. Recent studies with mammalian cells have produced conflicting results concerning this question. These studies have relied almost exclusively on fluorescent dyes to measure ROS levels. Insofar as ROS are very reactive and inherently unstable, a more reliable method for measuring changes in their intracellular levels is to measure their damage (e.g. the accumulation of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in DNA, and oxidative protein carbonylation) or to measure the expression of an oxidative stress-induced gene, e.g. SOD1. Here we used these approaches as well as a fluorescent dye, carboxy-H2-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H2-DCFDA), to determine whether ROS levels change in yeast cells exposed to anoxia. These studies reveal that the level of mitochondrial and cytosolic protein carbonylation, the level of 8-OH-dG in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, and the expression of SOD1 all increase transiently during a shift to anoxia. These studies also reveal that carboxy-H2-DCFDA is an unreliable reporter of ROS levels in yeast cells shifted to anoxia. By using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight), we have found that specific proteins become carbonylated during a shift to anoxia and that some of these proteins are the same proteins that become carbonylated during peroxidative stress. The mitochondrial respiratory chain is responsible for much of this carbonylation. Together, these findings indicate that yeast cells exposed to anoxia experience transient oxidative stress and raise the possibility that this initiates the induction of hypoxic genes.

Together, these findings indicate that yeast cells exposed to anoxia experience transient oxidative stress and raise the possibility that this initiates the induction of hypoxic genes. In many organisms, adaptation to changing oxygen concentrations is achieved both by the short term effects of oxygen on energy metabolism and the long term effects of oxygen on the expression of oxygen-responsive genes in the nucleus (1Hochachka P.W.

These oxygen-regulated nuclear genes can be placed into one of the two following groups: aerobic genes, which are transcribed optimally in the presence of air; and hypoxic genes, which are transcribed optimally under anoxic or micro-aerophilic conditions. In some case, proteins have both aerobic and hypoxic isoforms that are interchangeable but functionally different (3Allen L.A. Zhao X.-J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 110-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 4Burke P.V. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1163-1175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oxygen-responsive transcription factors that regulate these genes have been identified in a number of different organisms (5Poyton R.O. Respir.

Two fundamentally different types of model have been proposed. In the first model, oxygen has a direct effect on transcription either by acting on a transcription factor itself or by affecting a component that interacts with a transcription factor (8Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W.

In a second model, oxygen is sensed more distally by a proximal oxygen sensor, a signal is produced, and the signal initiates a signal transduction cascade that affects distal transcription factors (for review see Ref. 12Bunn F.H. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Two different hemoproteins have been implicated as possible oxygen sensors for the induction of hypoxic genes in eucaryotic cells. One is a multisubunit cytochrome b-like NAD(P)H oxidase present in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. It has been proposed that in the presence of oxygen this protein generates superoxide, which is converted to hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; 8-OH-dG, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine; carboxy-H2-DCFDA, carboxy-H2-dichloro-dihydrofluorescein diacetate; DNPH, 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenol; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. that serve to facilitate degradation of Hif-1α, a subunit of the global hypoxic transcription factor Hif-1 (13Zhu H. Bunn H.F. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This leads to the suppression of expression of Hif-1-regulated hypoxic genes under normoxic conditions. According to this model, ROS levels drop in cells exposed to reduced atmospheric oxygen; this leads to the stabilization of Hif-1α and the induction of Hif-1-regulated hypoxic genes. The second hemoprotein that has been implicated in the induction of hypoxic genes is cytochromec oxidase. Studies with yeast using cytochrome coxidase-deficient yeast nuclear mutants, a respiratory-deficient ρo mutant, or respiratory inhibitors have shown that cytochrome c oxidase and the mitochondrial respiratory chain are required for the induction of nuclear hypoxic genes when cells are exposed to anoxia (14Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1177-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Staahl B.T. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Similar studies with mammalian tissue culture cells, using respiratory-deficient ρo cells, respiratory inhibitors, and xenomitochondrial cybrids, have reported that the respiratory chain is required for the induction of hypoxic genes in Hep3B hepatoma cells (16Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35863-35867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Studies with Hep3B cells have also reported that the respiratory chain produces reactive oxygen species when cells are shifted to hypoxic conditions, that the concentrations of these ROS increase throughout the cell, and that this increase in ROS concentration serves to stabilize Hif-1α, which then leads to the induction of Hif-1-dependent nuclear hypoxic genes (16Chandel N.S.

It is not clear if the respiratory chain is required for hypoxic gene induction in all mammalian cell types (e.g. see Refs. 19Vaux E.C. Metzen E. Yeates K.M. Ratcliff P.J. Blood. 2001; 98: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar and 20Scrinivas V. Leshchinsky I. Sang N. King M.P. Minchenko A. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Also unclear is whether ROS influence the activity of the prolyl or asparagine hydroxylases that have recently been implicated in the stabilization and function of Hif-1α (8Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J.

Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). The models that have been proposed for how cytochrome b-like NAD(P)H oxidase and cytochrome c oxidase function as oxygen sensors for Hif-1-dependent induction of hypoxic nuclear genes in mammalian cells have both focused on ROS as intermediaries that connect a proximal oxygen sensor with the distal transcription factor. However, they are diametrically opposed with regards to the effects of hypoxia on intracellular ROS levels. Whereas the first model requires that ROS levels decrease in cells exposed to hypoxia, the second model requires that they increase. Experiments designed to determine how hypoxia affects ROS levels in mammalian cells have produced conflicting results, often with the same cell type. For example, one group has reported that ROS levels in Hep3B hepatoma cells increase upon exposure to hypoxia (18Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar), whereas another group has reported that ROS levels decrease in HepG2 (22Fandrey J. Frede S. Jelkmann W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) or Hep3B hepatoma cells to hypoxia (23Fandrey J. Genius J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 475: 153-159Crossref Google Scholar). These studies used fluorescent dyes (either 2′,7′- dichlorofluorescein diacetate or dihydrorhodamine 123) to measure ROS levels in cells exposed to hypoxia. Although these dyes are widely used to assess intracellular H2O2 levels, the mechanism by which they become oxidized is not entirely clear (24Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Because these dyes produced conflicting results in mammalian cells shifted from normoxic to hypoxic conditions, it has been suggested that they lack the necessary precision to monitor ROS levels in cells experiencing changes in oxygen concentration (25Semenza G.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 281-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This would not be surprising because ROS are transient, highly reactive, and probably oxidize macromolecules (proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids) in their immediate vicinity. To help resolve the controversy concerning how ROS levels change in eucaryotic cells exposed to low levels of oxygen and, at the same time, to begin to address whether ROS are involved in hypoxic gene induction in yeast, we have shifted cells from normoxic to anoxic conditions and have monitored oxidative stress in four different ways: 1) by using carboxy-H2-DCFDA, which becomes oxidized upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide and ROS; 2) by assessing levels of oxidative protein and 3) DNA damage; and 4) by examining the expression of SOD1, an oxidative stress-induced gene. The following Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were used: JM43 (Matα his4-580 leu2-3, trp1–289, 112 ura3-52 [ρ+]) (26McEwen J.E., Ko, C. Kloeckner-Gruissem B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11872-11879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); JM43 ρ0(Matα his4-580 trp1-289 leu2-3, 112 ura3-52 [ρ0] (27Waterland R.A. Basu A. Chance B. Poyton R.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18499-18507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). They were grown in SSG-TEA, supplemented with Tween 80, ergosterol, silicon antifoam, and amino acids and uracil, as needed (15Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Staahl B.T. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5446-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Aerobic cultures and pre-cultures were grown in a shaker (200 rpm) at 28 °C and harvested in logarithmic growth phase. For shift experiments between aerobic and anaerobic conditions, mid-logarithmic phase aerobic pre-cultures were inoculated into a New Brunswick Scientific BioFloIIc fermentor, equipped with a gas-flow train that allows cells to be cultured to steady state at defined oxygen concentrations (29Burke P.V. Kwast K.E. Verts F. Poyton R.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These fermentor cultures were grown in air to a cell density of ∼2 × 107 cells per ml; then the gas entering the fermentor vessel was changed to O2-free N2 containing 2.5% CO2. Anaerobic cultures were grown in the fermentor in the dark at 28 °C and 200 rpm and sparged with a gas mixture containing 97.5% N2 and 2.5% CO2. The gas mixture was passed through an Oxyclear O2 absorber (Lab-Clear, Oakland, CA) to prevent trace O2 from entering the fermentor. Temperature, pH, sparge rate, and dissolved oxygen concentration in the fermentor were monitored and maintained as described (15Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Staahl B.T. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5446-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 29Burke P.V. Kwast K.E. Verts F. Poyton R.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1040-1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both anoxic and shift cultures were grown in the dark to prevent photoinhibition (30Sulkowski E. Guerin B. Defaye J. Slonimski P.P. Nature. 1964; 202: 36-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cell growth was followed by measuring turbidity with a Klett-Summerson colorimeter (No. 54 green filter), and cells were harvested in mid-logarithmic phase. During harvest, cultures were chilled to −4 °C, washed twice with ice-cold distilled water, and either processed immediately or frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cells were spheroplasted as described (3Allen L.A. Zhao X.-J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 110-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), except that bovine serum albumin was omitted from the post-spheroplast and lysis buffers for experiments in which the carbonyl content in cytosolic or mitochondrial proteins was quantitated. All steps after spheroplasting were performed at 4 °C. The spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 3000 × g), washed gently in post-spheroplast buffer (1.5 m sorbitol, 1 mmNa2EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0), and sedimented at 3000 × g. The pelleted cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.6 m mannitol, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) and lysed in a Sorvall Omnimixer (3 s at low speed and 25 s at full speed). The cell lysate was then centrifuged for 5 min at 1,900 × g to pellet unbroken cells, nuclei, and debris. The supernatant contained the mitochondria as well as cytosolic proteins. It was decanted and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,100 ×g to pellet the mitochondria. The resulting supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The mitochondrial pellet was washed in mitochondrial lysis buffer minus bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0, homogenized with a glass-Teflon homogenizer, and centrifuged at 1651 × g for 5 min to pellet cell debris that was trapped in the pellet. The supernatant, containing the mitochondria, was decanted and centrifuged at 23,000 × g for 10 min. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in Milli-Q H2O and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Mitochondrial DNA was obtained from mitochondria, isolated as above, using the method of Querol and Barrio (31Querol A. Barrio E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Nuclear DNA was isolated using the Y-DERTM YEAST DNA Extraction Kit (Pierce). Carboxy-H2-DCFDA was used to try to assess hydrogen peroxide levels in aerobic JM43 cultures, anaerobic JM43 cultures, aerobic JM43ρocultures, and in aerobic JM43 cultures treated with peroxide or peroxide plus the spin-trap N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone. Carboxy-H2-DCFDA, dissolved in Me2SO, was added to cultures at a final concentration of 10 μm1 h before measurements were taken. For measurements taken during a shift from normoxic to anoxic conditions, carboxy-H2-DCFDA was added to cultures at a final concentration of 11.8 μm 105 min prior to the shift, and samples were taken every 20 min for 5 h. For these shift studies, total intracellular levels of carboxy-H2-DCFDA were estimated by adding 1% hydrogen peroxide to aliquots of cells sampled from the fermentor every 20 min after the shift and measuring fluorescence as described below. Fluorescence was measured in three 100-μl aliquots of either steady state or shifted cells that were diluted 10-fold in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, and sonicated briefly to disperse cells. Fluorescence (wavelength, 515–545 nm) of 5,000 cells was measured in each aliquot (15,000 total) using a BD PharMingen fluorescent-activated cell sorter equipped with a 15-milliwatt argon laser. Isolated mitochondrial or nuclear DNA was hydrolyzed as described (32Shigenaga M.K. Park J.W. Cundy K.C. Gimeno C.J. Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), using nuclease P1 and alkaline phosphatase. 8-Hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) levels were quantified using the isocratic high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method described by McCabe et al. (33McCabe D.R. Acworth I.N. Maidt M.L. Floyd R.A. Proc. Am. Assoc. Cancer Res. 1997; 38: 336Google Scholar). All data were analyzed using ESA (Chelmsford, MA) CoulArray for Windows software and expressed in terms of the ratio 8-OH-dG:105 dG. Reagents were HPLC grade, and Milli-Q water was further purified using a Waters Sep-Pak solid phase extraction column. Carbonyl content of mitochondrial and cytosolic protein fractions was determined after derivatization with 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine (DNPH) (34Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). Nucleic acids in cytosolic fractions were removed by treatment with streptomycin sulfate, prior to the addition DNPH (35Levine R.L. Garland D. Oliver C.N. Amici A. Climent I. Lenz A.-G. Ahn B.-W. Shaltiel S. Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (4980) Google Scholar). Derivatized protein samples were fractionated by HPLC on a Waters model 626 fitted with a Waters 600S controller and a Waters 996 Photodiode Array Detector, using Zorbax GF 450 and Zorbax GF 250 gel filtration columns run in series. The columns were calibrated and eluted (flow rate 1 ml/min) with 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 0.5m KPO4, pH 2.5. Eluants were monitored for absorbance at 366 and 280 nm (34Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial and cytosolic protein samples for SDS-PAGE were prepared as follows. One volume of sample containing 5 or 10 μg of protein was added to an equal volume of 12% SDS. One additional volume of 20 mmDNPH in 10% trifluoroacetic acid was added, and the mixture was incubated for 35 min at room temperature. The derivatization reaction was stopped by adding 1.05 volumes of 2 m Tris base, 30% glycerol (final concentration of 0.52 m). Derivatized protein samples were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels (resolving gel: 10% (w/v) 32:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.4m Tris, pH 8.8; stacking gel: 3.5% (w/v) 32:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.125 m Tris, pH 6.8) Gels were run at 110 V until the yellow front of underivatized DNPH reached the bottom of the gel. Aliquots of mitochondria (125 μg of protein) or cytosol (70–90 μg of protein) were diluted 5-fold in lysis buffer containing 9 m urea, 2.5 m thiourea, 5% (w/v) CHAPS, 12.5 mm DTT, and 1% (v/v) carrier ampholytes, pH 3–10, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 10 mm DTT, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (v/v) carrier ampholytes, pH 3–10, and a trace of bromphenol blue) was then added to bring the total volume up to 250 μl. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and then used to rehydrate 13-cm Immobiline Drystrips (Amersham Biosciences) with a pH 3–10 linear gradient. The strips were rehydrated overnight in an Immobiline Drystrip Reswelling Tray (Amersham Biosciences). First dimension isoelectric focusing was carried out at 20 °C using a Multiphor II flatbed system (Amersham Biosciences) at 300 V for 1 min, 300 V for 4 h, 3000 V for 5 h, and 3000 V for 10 h with a EPS 3501 xl (Amersham Biosciences) electrophoresis power supply. After isoelectric focusing, the Immobiline strips were derivatized with DNPH using a modification of the method of Reinheckel et al.(36Reinheckel T. Korn S. Mohung S. Augustin W. Halangk W. Schild L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 375: 59-65Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). They were incubated in a solution of 10 mm DNPH in 10% trifluoroacetic acid for 20 min with agitation and then incubated with agitation for 10 min at room temperature in each of the following solutions: 1) 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 murea, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 2% (w/v) SDS; 2) 150 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8 m urea, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 1% (w/v) DTT; and 3) 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8m urea, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 4% (w/v) iodoacetamide and a trace amount of bromphenol blue. The Immobiline strips were loaded onto a 20 × 20-cm polyacrylamide gel composed of 8–18% (w/v) 37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 0.37 mTris, pH 8.8. The 20 × 20-cm gradient gels were poured using a Gradient Mixer GM-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and a Protean II xi Multi-Gel Casting Chamber (Bio-Rad). The gels were run at 10 °C on Protean II xl m Multicell Unit (Bio-Rad) at a constant 15 mA per gel for ∼17 h in a running buffer containing 40 mm glycine, 200 mm Tris, and 0.1% SDS. After electrophoresis, proteins were visualized by silver staining (37Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3741) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto Hybond ECL (Amersham Biosciences) nitrocellulose membranes using a Semi-Phor (Hoefer) Blotting apparatus. Oxidatively modified proteins were detected with anti-DNP antibodies (Dako) (at a dilution of 1:4000) and secondary horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies (at a dilution of 1:25000), followed by a chemiluminescence reaction using a chemiluminescence detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Gels were scanned, and the resulting images were evaluated using Melanie 3 (Geneva Bioinformatics, Geneva, Switzerland) software. Silver-stained spots were cut out of the gels for in-gel digestion and destained with 1 ml of 50 mm sodium thiosulfate, 15 mm potassium ferricyanide followed by 4 washes in 1 ml of Milli-Q H2O. The spots were then equilibrated for 20 min in 500 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and then incubated for 20 min in 500 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The spots were dried, rehydrated for digestion with 5 μg/ml porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 88% formic acid. The peptides were extracted from the gel matrix by sonication for 20 min and then concentrated using Zip Tips (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Peptide mass figure printing was performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Voyager-DE STR, operating in delayed reflector mode at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. The peptide samples were co-crystallized with matrix on a gold-coated sample plate using 0.6 μl of matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxytranscinnamic acid) and 0.6 μl of sample. After external calibration with protein standards, the spectra were internally calibrated using trypsin autolysis products. The monoisotope peptide masses were assigned and then used in data base searches with PeptIdent (ca.expansy.org/tools/peptident.html). Cysteines were treated with iodoacetamide to form carboxyamidomethyl cysteine, and methionine was considered to be oxidized. One missed cleavage was allowed and a minimum of 4 matching peptides was required for a match. A pI range of ± 2.00 and a molecular weight range of ±20% were used for the data base search. Criteria used to identify each protein included the extent of sequence coverage, the number of peptides matched, and the match with the theoretical pI andM r as determined from the gel. Total RNA, isolated as described previously (38Elder R.T. Loh E.Y. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2432-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), was denatured and separated on 1.5% agarose gels containing MOPS/formaldehyde buffer (20 mm MOPS, 40 mm sodium acetate, 8 mm EDTA, and 220 mm formaldehyde (39Tsang S.S. Yin X. Guzzo-Arkuran C. Jones V.S. Davison A.J. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 380-381PubMed Google Scholar)). The RNA was transferred to Nytran Plus membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and hybridized as described (40Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Brown K. Poyton R.O. Curr. Genet. 1997; 32: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using DNA probes to ACT1 and SOD1. The probes (a 520-bp StyI fragment of ACT1, and a 1041-bp fragment made to correspond to the SOD1-coding sequence and 41 nucleotides of its 5′-flanking sequence) were prepared by random-primer labeling of double-stranded DNA fragments using [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (cf. Ref. 41Sambrook J. Fritsch F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 7. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.13-10.17Google Scholar). Stringency washes were performed as described previously (42Trueblood C.E. Poyton R.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; : 3520-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Protein concentration was determined according to Lowry et al. (43Lowry O.H.

https://openalex.org/W2079728044,"Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) is the deadliest of all known biological substances. Although its toxicity makes BoNT/A a biological warfare threat, its biologic activity makes it an increasingly useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of muscular disorders. However, almost 200 years after its discovery, the neuronal cell components required for the activity of this deadly toxin have not been unequivocally identified. In this work, neuroblastoma cells expressing synaptotagmin I, a protein shown to be bound by BoNT/A, were used to determine whether specific gangliosides were necessary for BoNT/A activity as measured by synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) cleavage. Ganglioside GT1b was found to support BoNT/A activity significantly more effectively than GD1a, which was far more effective than GM1 when added to ganglioside-deficient murine cholinergic Neuro 2a or to human adrenergic SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. Whereas both cell lines expressed synaptotagmin I, SNAP-25 cleavage was not observed in the absence of complex gangliosides. These results indicate that 1) gangliosides are required for BoNT/A activity, 2) synaptotagmin I in the absence of gangliosides does not support BoNT/A activity, and 3) Neuro 2a cells are an efficient model system for studying the biological activity of BoNT/A.

J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1999; 18: vii-xCrossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although its toxicity makes BoNT/A a biological warfare threat, its biologic activity makes it an increasingly useful therapeutic agent (2Leggiadro R.J. Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 2000; 21: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Johnson E.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 551-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Produced as a single polypeptide chain by the bacteriumClostridium botulinum, BoNT/A (150 kDa) is subsequently cleaved into two functional subunits held together by a disulfide bond. The 50-kDa “light chain” is a zinc endoprotease. It catalyzes the cleavage of synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) at the neuromuscular junction, thereby preventing neurotransmitter release and inducing a flaccid paralysis (4Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). The 100-kDa “heavy chain” is made up of an N-terminal half, believed to mediate cytoplasmic entry of the light chain, and a C-terminal half (BoNT/A-HC), which mediates cellular adherence (5Lalli G. Herreros J. Osborne S.L. Montecucco C. Rossetto O. Schiavo G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2715-2724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the enzymatic activity of the neurotoxin has been well defined, questions still exist regarding the molecular interactions needed for its cellular binding, internalization, and transport to its protein substrate. Identification of these interactions will provide guidance for developing potential inhibitors of its action.It was 30 years ago that gangliosides were first mentioned as potential receptors for BoNT/A. Gangliosides, sialic acid containing glycosphingolipids, are found on the outer leaflet of cell membranes. Specifically, polysialylated gangliosides like GT1b (6Svennerholm L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1980; 125: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) were shown to be involved in BoNT/A neurotoxicity (7Simpson L.L. Rapport M.M. J. Neurochem. 1971; 18: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Simpson L.L. Rapport M.M. J. Neurochem. 1971; 18: 1341-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since then, GT1b has been shown to inhibit BoNT/A binding to synaptosomes (9Kitamura M. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 628: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), to quench BoNT/A fluorescence (10Kamata Y. Yoshimoto M. Kozaki S. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and to be bound by BoNT/A when it was immobilized on either a thin layer chromatogram (11Takamizawa K. Iwamori M. Kozaki S. Sakaguchi G. Tanaka R. Takayama H. Nagai Y. FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or on plastic wells (12Schengrund C.L. DasGupta B.R. Ringler N.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for the adherence of BoNT/A-HC to GT1b-containing liposomes was recently reported to be ∼10−8m (13Singh A.K. Harrison S.H. Schoeniger J.S. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 6019-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, the cleavage of sialic acid residues by sialidase treatment of cultured cells isolated from spinal cord (14Bigalke H. Muller H. Dreyer F. Toxicon. 1986; 24: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and adrenergic chromaffin cells (15Marxen P. Fuhrmann U. Bigalke H. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was shown to reduce BoNT/A potency, whereas the addition of a mixture of gangliosides to the sialidase-treated chromaffin cells was found to restore it (16Marxen P. Erdmann G. Bigalke H. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, a monoclonal antibody to GT1b was shown to antagonize the action of BoNT/A on rat superior cervical ganglion neurons (17Kozaki S. Kamata Y. Watarai S. Nishiki T. Mochida S. Microb. Pathog. 1998; 25: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Most recently, GM2/GD2 synthase knock-out mice were reported to show an increased time of survival when injected with a lethal dose of BoNT/A (18Kitamura M. Takamiya K. Aizawa S. Furukawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Tetanus toxin, the other member of the clostridial toxin family that has an affinity comparable with that of BoNT/A for gangliosides (13Singh A.K. Harrison S.H. Schoeniger J.S. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 6019-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Lee K.K. Altman E. Young N.M. J. Biol.

Clifford J.C. Neale E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25173-25180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of tetanus toxin C-fragment complexed with a synthetic GT1b analogue indicated the presence of two binding sites in the β-trefoil domain. One of these two sites was also found in the β-trefoil domain of BoNT/A and is strongly believed to be a ganglioside binding site (21Fotinou C. Emsley P. Black I. Ando H. Ishida H. Kiso M. Sinha K.A.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All of these studies indicated that gangliosides might be receptors for BoNT/A.In addition to gangliosides, a cell surface protein(s) may also be needed for BoNT/A adherence to cells. In contrast to more recent studies on chromaffin cells (16Marxen P. Erdmann G. Bigalke H. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), early studies show that BoNT/A binding to rat brain synaptosomes was trypsin-sensitive (23Kitamura M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1976; 295: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Dolly J.O. Williams R.S. Black J.D. Tse C.K. Hambleton P. Melling J. Toxicon. 1982; 20: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Also, a 140-kDa protein in cholinergic synaptosomes prepared fromTorpedo electric organs was identified as a BoNT/A-binding protein. The interaction of BoNT/A with this 140-kDa protein was both sialidase and trypsin-sensitive (25Blasi J. Egea G. Castiella M.J. Arribas M. Solsona C. Richardson P.J. Marsal J. J. Neural Transm. 1992; 90: 87-102Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These studies among others led to the hypothesis that botulinum neurotoxins require a “double receptor” comprised of protein and gangliosides (26Montecucco C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 314-317Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (324) Google Scholar). BoNT/B appears to follow this model. Nishiki et al. (27Nishiki T. Ogasawara J. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1158: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Nishiki T. Kamata Y. Nemoto Y. Omori A. Ito T. Takahashi M. Kozaki S. J. Biol.

Lett. 1996; 208: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) found that synaptotagmins I and II in the presence of polysialylated gangliosides serve as the receptors for BoNT/B. Synaptotagmins, proteins that serve as calcium sensors for synaptic vesicle fusion, have also been proposed as possible receptors for BoNT/A. Studies indicated that BoNT/A adhered to synaptotagmin I solubilized from rat brain synaptosomes as well as to purified synaptotagmin I immobilized on plastic microtiter wells (31Li L. Singh B.R. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 215-226PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the observations made with BoNT/B, this binding was not enhanced by the presence of gangliosides (31Li L. Singh B.R. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 215-226PubMed Google Scholar).In this work, the question of whether specific gangliosides were needed for BoNT/A to act on SNAP-25 in synaptotagmin I expressing murine cholinergic Neuro 2a and human adrenergic SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells was addressed. Both cell types were found to be susceptible to BoNT/A only when they contained specific gangliosides. Interestingly, in their absence, BoNT/A activity was not observed, even though synaptotagmin I was present.DISCUSSIONBotulinum neurotoxin was first described in the early 1800s (39Erbguth F.J. Naumann M. Neurology. 1999; 53: 1850-1853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Now, almost 200 years later, the molecules necessary for the neurotoxin to enter neurons and find its substrate have yet to be unequivocally identified. This lack of knowledge hampers the development of treatments for botulism or improvement of its use as a therapeutic agent. If the components needed for the interaction of BoNT with neurons could be identified, inhibitors could be designed to prevent its uptake and thus limit its deadly activity. Inhibitors that could be easily administered, perhaps taken orally, would be of particular interest to victims of bioterrorism or military personnel who may be exposed to BoNT, especially in areas far from modern medical facilities.Many of the early studies of BoNT/A implicated gangliosides as possible receptors. Gangliosides were shown to reduce the toxicity of BoNT/Ain vivo (7Simpson L.L. Rapport M.M. J. Neurochem. 1971; 18: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Simpson L.L. Rapport M.M. J.

However, the affinity of the interaction of BoNT/A with gangliosides has been traditionally believed to be weak in relation to other receptor/ligand interactions and therefore unable to account for the high potency of the toxin. For example, cholera toxin binds to its cell surface receptor, ganglioside GM1, with aKD in the range of 10−9 to 10−12m (13Singh A.K. Harrison S.H. Schoeniger J.S. Anal.

However, the recent report (13Singh A.K. Harrison S.H. Schoeniger J.S. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 6019-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that the apparent dissociation constant for the adherence of BoNT/A to GT1b was ∼10−8m supports the hypothesis that GT1b could function as its receptor.In this work, BoNT/A activity was observed in N2a cells when it was added to the medium at concentrations similar to those reported for its dissociation constant. The observations that PPMP treatment of N2a cells resulted in an 85% decrease in GD1a synthesis and eliminated observable BoNT/A activity, while growing the PPMP-treated cells in the presence of GD1a or GT1b restored activity, indicate that specific gangliosides are needed for BoNT/A activity. These observations plus the fact that SK-N-SH cells expressing primarily GM3 and GM2 were not susceptible to BoNT/A unless they were grown in medium containing a gangliotetraose ganglioside (GT1b > GD1a > GM1) indicate that specific gangliosides must be present in the cells in order for added BoNT/A to catalyze the cleavage of SNAP-25. The need for polysialylation was corroborated by the fact that GD1a or GT1b was more effective at restoring BoNT/A activity than GM1. This observation is in agreement with studies indicating that BoNT/A is neutralized by and has a greater affinity for GD1a and GT1b than GM1 (9Kitamura M. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 628: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Takamizawa K. Iwamori M. Kozaki S. Sakaguchi G. Tanaka R. Takayama H. Nagai Y.

Toxicon. 1991; 29: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).The need for polysialylated gangliosides may explain the observation that to see the levels of SNAP-25 cleavage in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells that were comparable with those observed in this study with control murine N2a cells, a 50-fold greater concentration of BoNT/A and a 24-h longer exposure time were used (42Purkiss J.R. Friis L.M. Doward S. Quinn C.P. Neurotoxicology. 2001; 22: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells may be less susceptible to BoNT/A than N2a cells because of their lower expression of polysialylated gangliosides. The monosialylated gangliosides GM1, GM2, and GM3 were shown to account for 71.5% of the total ganglioside sialic acid content of the SH-SY5Y cells, while GD1a accounted for the rest (43Ruan S. Raj B.K. Lloyd K.O. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the N2a cells used in this study, GD1a comprised 56 ± 3% (n = 4) of the total ganglioside sialic acid. The higher content of polysialylated gangliosides in N2a cells may account for why activity was observed at a BoNT/A concentration below 1 nm. Combined, these observations indicate that N2a cells provide an effective model for studying the biological activity of BoNT/A.Although the addition of GD1a to N2a cells resulted in a cell-associated level of GD1a that was ∼40% that of controls (Fig.1), it only restored BoNT/A activity to ∼20% of that seen in control cells. This observation coupled with the results obtained for the SK-N-SH cells indicated that there might be a relationship between cell-associated polysialylated gangliotetraose ganglioside concentration and BoNT/A activity. Further support for such a relationship was provided by the observation that when PPMP-treated N2a cells were grown in the presence of higher concentrations of GT1b, they became more susceptible to BoNT/A-catalyzed cleavage of SNAP-25.Due to the potency of BoNT/A, some believe the receptor must be a cell surface protein exhibiting a very high affinity for the toxin. Because the leading candidate for a protein receptor is currently synaptotagmin (31Li L. Singh B.R. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 215-226PubMed Google Scholar), its expression and relation to BoNT/A activity were studied. The reported KD for BoNT/B adherence to synaptotagmin I reconstituted with gangliosides is 2.3 nm (29Nishiki T. Tokuyama Y. Kamata Y. Nemoto Y. Yoshida A. Sato K. Sekiguchi M. Takahashi M. Kozaki S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), which is the same order of magnitude as the concentration of BoNT/A used in these studies. Western analyses indicated that both cell lines used in this work express synaptotagmin I. The observation that BoNT/A was unable to catalyze the cleavage of SNAP-25 in either the PPMP-treated N2a cells or SK-N-SH cells indicates that in the absence of gangliosides, synaptotagmin I is unable to efficiently mediate BoNT/A activity. However, these observations do not negate the hypothesis that when gangliosides are present, synaptotagmin I might serve as a receptor for BoNT/A. Combined, these observations indicate that in the absence of specific gangliosides, synaptotagmin I cannot support BoNT/A activity.The results reported here do not define the role gangliosides have in the action of BoNT/A, only that they are essential. However, based on the studies discussed previously, it is probable that the neurotoxin binds to polysialylated gangliotetraose gangliosides during its interaction with the cell. The results of this work indicate that these gangliosides are required for the biological activity of botulinum neurotoxin A. The requirement for specific gangliosides supports the hypothesis that a possible way to prevent BoNT/A from acting on neurons would be to inhibit its interaction with cell surface gangliosides. Studies are in progress to design ganglioside-based inhibitors of BoNT/A activity. Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A),1 one of seven serotypes of BoNT, is the deadliest of all known biological substances, being approximately one million times more poisonous than cobra toxin (1Singh B.R. J. Toxicol. Toxin Rev. 1999; 18: vii-xCrossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although its toxicity makes BoNT/A a biological warfare threat, its biologic activity makes it an increasingly useful therapeutic agent (2Leggiadro R.J. Infect. Control Hosp. Epidemiol. 2000; 21: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Johnson E.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 551-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Produced as a single polypeptide chain by the bacteriumClostridium botulinum, BoNT/A (150 kDa) is subsequently cleaved into two functional subunits held together by a disulfide bond. The 50-kDa “light chain” is a zinc endoprotease. It catalyzes the cleavage of synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) at the neuromuscular junction, thereby preventing neurotransmitter release and inducing a flaccid paralysis (4Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). The 100-kDa “heavy chain” is made up of an N-terminal half, believed to mediate cytoplasmic entry of the light chain, and a C-terminal half (BoNT/A-HC), which mediates cellular adherence (5Lalli G. Herreros J. Osborne S.L. Montecucco C. Rossetto O. Schiavo G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2715-2724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the enzymatic activity of the neurotoxin has been well defined, questions still exist regarding the molecular interactions needed for its cellular binding, internalization, and transport to its protein substrate. Identification of these interactions will provide guidance for developing potential inhibitors of its action. It was 30 years ago that gangliosides were first mentioned as potential receptors for BoNT/A. Gangliosides, sialic acid containing glycosphingolipids, are found on the outer leaflet of cell membranes. Specifically, polysialylated gangliosides like GT1b (6Svennerholm L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1980; 125: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) were shown to be involved in BoNT/A neurotoxicity (7Simpson L.L. Rapport M.M. J. Neurochem. 1971; 18: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Simpson L.L. Rapport M.M. J. Neurochem. 1971; 18: 1341-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Since then, GT1b has been shown to inhibit BoNT/A binding to synaptosomes (9Kitamura M. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 628: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), to quench BoNT/A fluorescence (10Kamata Y. Yoshimoto M. Kozaki S. Toxicon. 1997; 35: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and to be bound by BoNT/A when it was immobilized on either a thin layer chromatogram (11Takamizawa K. Iwamori M. Kozaki S. Sakaguchi G. Tanaka R. Takayama H. Nagai Y. FEBS Lett. 1986; 201: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) or on plastic wells (12Schengrund C.L. DasGupta B.R. Ringler N.J. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for the adherence of BoNT/A-HC to GT1b-containing liposomes was recently reported to be ∼10−8m (13Singh A.K. Harrison S.H. Schoeniger J.S. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 6019-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, the cleavage of sialic acid residues by sialidase treatment of cultured cells isolated from spinal cord (14Bigalke H. Muller H. Dreyer F. Toxicon. 1986; 24: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and adrenergic chromaffin cells (15Marxen P. Fuhrmann U. Bigalke H. Toxicon. 1989; 27: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was shown to reduce BoNT/A potency, whereas the addition of a mixture of gangliosides to the sialidase-treated chromaffin cells was found to restore it (16Marxen P. Erdmann G. Bigalke H. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition, a monoclonal antibody to GT1b was shown to antagonize the action of BoNT/A on rat superior cervical ganglion neurons (17Kozaki S. Kamata Y. Watarai S. Nishiki T. Mochida S. Microb. Pathog. 1998; 25: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Most recently, GM2/GD2 synthase knock-out mice were reported to show an increased time of survival when injected with a lethal dose of BoNT/A (18Kitamura M. Takamiya K. Aizawa S. Furukawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Tetanus toxin, the other member of the clostridial toxin family that has an affinity comparable with that of BoNT/A for gangliosides (13Singh A.K. Harrison S.H. Schoeniger J.S. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 6019-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Lee K.K. Altman E. Young N.M. J. Biol.

Clifford J.C. Neale E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25173-25180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of tetanus toxin C-fragment complexed with a synthetic GT1b analogue indicated the presence of two binding sites in the β-trefoil domain. One of these two sites was also found in the β-trefoil domain of BoNT/A and is strongly believed to be a ganglioside binding site (21Fotinou C. Emsley P. Black I. Ando H. Ishida H. Kiso M. Sinha K.A. Fairweather N.F. Isaacs N.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32274-32281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,22Ginalski K. Venclovas C. Lesyng B. Fidelis K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All of these studies indicated that gangliosides might be receptors for BoNT/A. In addition to gangliosides, a cell surface protein(s) may also be needed for BoNT/A adherence to cells. In contrast to more recent studies on chromaffin cells (16Marxen P. Erdmann G. Bigalke H. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), early studies show that BoNT/A binding to rat brain synaptosomes was trypsin-sensitive (23Kitamura M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1976; 295: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 24Dolly J.O. Williams R.S. Black J.D. Tse C.K. Hambleton P. Melling J. Toxicon. 1982; 20: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Also, a 140-kDa protein in cholinergic synaptosomes prepared fromTorpedo electric organs was identified as a BoNT/A-binding protein. The interaction of BoNT/A with this 140-kDa protein was both sialidase and trypsin-sensitive (25Blasi J. Egea G. Castiella M.J. Arribas M. Solsona C. Richardson P.J. Marsal J. J. Neural Transm. 1992; 90: 87-102Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These studies among others led to the hypothesis that botulinum neurotoxins require a “double receptor” comprised of protein and gangliosides (26Montecucco C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 314-317Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (324) Google Scholar). BoNT/B appears to follow this model. Nishiki et al. (27Nishiki T. Ogasawara J. Kamata Y. Kozaki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1158: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Nishiki T. Kamata Y. Nemoto Y. Omori A. Ito T. Takahashi M. Kozaki S. J. Biol.

Lett. 1996; 208: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) found that synaptotagmins I and II in the presence of polysialylated gangliosides serve as the receptors for BoNT/B. Synaptotagmins, proteins that serve as calcium sensors for synaptic vesicle fusion, have also been proposed as possible receptors for BoNT/A. Studies indicated that BoNT/A adhered to synaptotagmin I solubilized from rat brain synaptosomes as well as to purified synaptotagmin I immobilized on plastic microtiter wells (31Li L. Singh B.R. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 215-226PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the observations made with BoNT/B, this binding was not enhanced by the presence of gangliosides (31Li L. Singh B.R. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 215-226PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, the question of whether specific gangliosides were needed for BoNT/A to act on SNAP-25 in synaptotagmin I expressing murine cholinergic Neuro 2a and human adrenergic SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells was addressed. Both cell types were found to be susceptible to BoNT/A only when they contained specific gangliosides. Interestingly, in their absence, BoNT/A activity was not observed, even though synaptotagmin I was present. DISCUSSIONBotulinum neurotoxin was first described in the early 1800s (39Erbguth F.J. Naumann M. Neurology. 1999; 53: 1850-1853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Now, almost 200 years later, the molecules necessary for the neurotoxin to enter neurons and find its substrate have yet to be unequivocally identified. This lack of knowledge hampers the development of treatments for botulism or improvement of its use as a therapeutic agent. If the components needed for the interaction of BoNT with neurons could be identified, inhibitors could be designed to prevent its uptake and thus limit its deadly activity. Inhibitors that could be easily administered, perhaps taken orally, would be of particular interest to victims of bioterrorism or military personnel who may be exposed to BoNT, especially in areas far from modern medical facilities.Many of the early studies of BoNT/A implicated gangliosides as possible receptors. Gangliosides were shown to reduce the toxicity of BoNT/Ain vivo (7Simpson L.L. Rapport M.M. J. Neurochem. 1971; 18: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 8Simpson L.L. Rapport M.M. J.

However, based on the studies discussed previously, it is probable that the neurotoxin binds to polysialylated gangliotetraose gangliosides during its interaction with the cell. The results of this work indicate that these gangliosides are required for the biological activity of botulinum neurotoxin A. The requirement for specific gangliosides supports the hypothesis that a possible way to prevent BoNT/A from acting on neurons would be to inhibit its interaction with cell surface gangliosides. Studies are in progress to design ganglioside-based inhibitors of BoNT/A activity. Botulinum neurotoxin was first described in the early 1800s (39Erbguth F.J. Naumann M. Neurology. 1999; 53: 1850-1853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Now, almost 200 years later, the molecules necessary for the neurotoxin to enter neurons and find its substrate have yet to be unequivocally identified. This lack of knowledge hampers the development of treatments for botulism or improvement of its use as a therapeutic agent. If the components needed for the interaction of BoNT with neurons could be identified, inhibitors could be designed to prevent its uptake and thus limit its deadly activity. Inhibitors that could be easily administered, perhaps taken orally, would be of particular interest to victims of bioterrorism or military personnel who may be exposed to BoNT, especially in areas far from modern medical facilities. Many of the early studies of BoNT/A implicated gangliosides as possible receptors. Gangliosides were shown to reduce the toxicity of BoNT/Ain vivo (7Simpson L.L. Rapport M.M. J.

Tetanus toxin, the other member of the clostridial toxin family that has an affinity comparable with that of BoNT/A for gangliosides (13Singh A.K. Harrison S.H. Schoeniger J.S. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 6019-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Lee K.K. Altman E. Young N.M. J. Biol.

Bateman K.E. Clifford J.C. Neale E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25173-25180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystal structure of the tetanus toxin C-fragment complexed with a synthetic GT1b analogue indicated the presence of two binding sites in the β-trefoil domain. One of these two sites is also found in the β-trefoil domain of BoNT/A and is strongly believed to bind a ganglioside (21Fotinou C. Emsley P. Black I. Ando H. Ishida H. Kiso M. Sinha K.A.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the affinity of the interaction of BoNT/A with gangliosides has been traditionally believed to be weak in relation to other receptor/ligand interactions and therefore unable to account for the high potency of the toxin. For example, cholera toxin binds to its cell surface receptor, ganglioside GM1, with aKD in the range of 10−9 to 10−12m (13Singh A.K. Harrison S.H. Schoeniger J.S. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 6019-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Lee K.K. Altman E. Young N.M. J. Biol.

However, the recent report (13Singh A.K. Harrison S.H. Schoeniger J.S. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 6019-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) that the apparent dissociation constant for the adherence of BoNT/A to GT1b was ∼10−8m supports the hypothesis that GT1b could function as its receptor. In this work, BoNT/A activity was observed in N2a cells when it was added to the medium at concentrations similar to those reported for its dissociation constant. The observations that PPMP treatment of N2a cells resulted in an 85% decrease in GD1a synthesis and eliminated observable BoNT/A activity, while growing the PPMP-treated cells in the presence of GD1a or GT1b restored activity, indicate that specific gangliosides are needed for BoNT/A activity. These observations plus the fact that SK-N-SH cells expressing primarily GM3 and GM2 were not susceptible to BoNT/A unless they were grown in medium containing a gangliotetraose ganglioside (GT1b > GD1a > GM1) indicate that specific gangliosides must be present in the cells in order for added BoNT/A to catalyze the cleavage of SNAP-25. The need for polysialylation was corroborated by the fact that GD1a or GT1b was more effective at restoring BoNT/A activity than GM1. This observation is in agreement with studies indicating that BoNT/A is neutralized by and has a greater affinity for GD1a and GT1b than GM1 (9Kitamura M. Iwamori M. Nagai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 628: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11Takamizawa K. Iwamori M. Kozaki S. Sakaguchi G. Tanaka R. Takayama H. Nagai Y.

Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1024-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,16Marxen P. Erdmann G. Bigalke H. Toxicon. 1991; 29: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The need for polysialylated gangliosides may explain the observation that to see the levels of SNAP-25 cleavage in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells that were comparable with those observed in this study with control murine N2a cells, a 50-fold greater concentration of BoNT/A and a 24-h longer exposure time were used (42Purkiss J.R. Friis L.M. Doward S. Quinn C.P. Neurotoxicology. 2001; 22: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y cells may be less susceptible to BoNT/A than N2a cells because of their lower expression of polysialylated gangliosides. The monosialylated gangliosides GM1, GM2, and GM3 were shown to account for 71.5% of the total ganglioside sialic acid content of the SH-SY5Y cells, while GD1a accounted for the rest (43Ruan S. Raj B.K. Lloyd K.O. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the N2a cells used in this study, GD1a comprised 56 ± 3% (n = 4) of the total ganglioside sialic acid. The higher content of polysialylated gangliosides in N2a cells may account for why activity was observed at a BoNT/A concentration below 1 nm. Combined, these observations indicate that N2a cells provide an effective model for studying the biological activity of BoNT/A. Although the addition of GD1a to N2a cells resulted in a cell-associated level of GD1a that was ∼40% that of controls (Fig.1), it only restored BoNT/A activity to ∼20% of that seen in control cells. This observation coupled with the results obtained for the SK-N-SH cells indicated that there might be a relationship between cell-associated polysialylated gangliotetraose ganglioside concentration and BoNT/A activity. Further support for such a relationship was provided by the observation that when PPMP-treated N2a cells were grown in the presence of higher concentrations of GT1b, they became more susceptible to BoNT/A-catalyzed cleavage of SNAP-25. Due to the potency of BoNT/A, some believe the receptor must be a cell surface protein exhibiting a very high affinity for the toxin. Because the leading candidate for a protein receptor is currently synaptotagmin (31Li L. Singh B.R. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 215-226PubMed Google Scholar), its expression and relation to BoNT/A activity were studied. The reported KD for BoNT/B adherence to synaptotagmin I reconstituted with gangliosides is 2.3 nm (29Nishiki T. Tokuyama Y. Kamata Y. Nemoto Y. Yoshida A. Sato K. Sekiguchi M. Takahashi M. Kozaki S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), which is the same order of magnitude as the concentration of BoNT/A used in these studies. Western analyses indicated that both cell lines used in this work express synaptotagmin I. The observation that BoNT/A was unable to catalyze the cleavage of SNAP-25 in either the PPMP-treated N2a cells or SK-N-SH cells indicates that in the absence of gangliosides, synaptotagmin I is unable to efficiently mediate BoNT/A activity. However, these observations do not negate the hypothesis that when gangliosides are present, synaptotagmin I might serve as a receptor for BoNT/A. Combined, these observations indicate that in the absence of specific gangliosides, synaptotagmin I cannot support BoNT/A activity. The results reported here do not define the role gangliosides have in the action of BoNT/A, only that they are essential. However, based on the studies discussed previously, it is probable that the neurotoxin binds to polysialylated gangliotetraose gangliosides during its interaction with the cell. The results of this work indicate that these gangliosides are required for the biological activity of botulinum neurotoxin A. The requirement for specific gangliosides supports the hypothesis that a possible way to prevent BoNT/A from acting on neurons would be to inhibit its interaction with cell surface gangliosides. Studies are in progress to design ganglioside-based inhibitors of BoNT/A activity."

Angiostatin is a ligand for integrin αvβ3 but does not induce stress fiber formation upon integrin binding, suggesting that angiostatin is a potential integrin antagonist. Plasmin, the parent molecule of angiostatin and a major extracellular protease, induces platelet aggregation, migration of peripheral blood monocytes, and release of arachidonate and leukotriene from several cell types. In the current study, we found that plasmin specifically bound to αvβ3 through the kringle domains and induced migration of endothelial cells. In contrast, angiostatin did not induce cell migration. Notably, angiostatin, anti-αvβ3 antibodies, RGD-peptide, and a serine protease inhibitor effectively blocked plasmin-induced cell migration. These results suggest that plasmin-induced migration of endothelial cells requires αvβ3 and the catalytic activity of plasmin and that this process is a potential target for the inhibitory activity of angiostatin.

Several recent studies have shown that tumor growth and metastasis are angiogenesis-dependent (2O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H.

A number of angiogenesis inhibitors (e.g. angiostatin and endostatin) have been identified, and they are mostly fragments or cryptic domains of large protein molecules (for review see Ref. 9Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Angiostatin, a proteolytic fragment of plasminogen, contains either the first three or first four kringle domains of plasminogen and is a potent inhibitor of tumor-induced angiogenesis in animal models (2O'Reilly M.S.

Marshall B. Flynn E., Ji, R.W. Folkman J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Angiostatin has promising therapeutic potential and is now in clinical trials. Plasminogen is first converted to the two-chain serine protease plasmin by cleavage of a single Arg561-Val562 peptide bond by urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and plasmin serves as both the substrate and enzyme for the generation of angiostatin (11Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Cundiff D.L. Grella D. Castellino F.J. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Lee F. Kramer R.A. Volpert O. Bouck N. Soff G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Several other mechanisms have been proposed for the generation of angiostatin from the plasminogen molecule (Ref. 12Lay A.J. Jiang X.M. Kisker O. Flynn E. Underwood A. Condron R. Hogg P.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and references therein). The anti-angiogenic functions of plasminogen kringles have been extensively studied using recombinant plasminogen kringles and kringle fragments produced by elastolytic processing of native plasminogen. Smaller fragments of angiostatin display differential effects on the suppression of endothelial cell growth (13Cao Y., Ji, R.W. Davidson D. Schaller J. Marti D. Sohndel S. McCance S.G. O'Reilly M.S. Llinas M. Folkman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29461-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Angiostatin has been reported to increase endothelial cell apoptosis and the activity of focal adhesion kinase (14Claesson-Welsh L. Welsh M. Ito N. Anand-Apte B. Soker S. Zetter B. O'Reilly M. Folkman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5579-5583Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) and block the migration of endothelial cells (15Ji W.R. Castellino F.J. Chang Y. Deford M.E.

It has been reported that angiostatin binds to ATP synthase on the cell surface and that binding of angiostatin to ATP synthase may mediate the anti-angiogenic effects of angiostatin and the down-regulation of endothelial cell proliferation and migration (16Moser T.L. Stack M.S. Asplin I. Enghild J.J. Hojrup P. Everitt L. Hubchak S. Schnaper H.W. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2811-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the anti-angiogenic actions of the kringle structures has not been established. Recently, we have demonstrated that angiostatin binds to integrin αvβ3 and that αvβ3 may be a predominant receptor for angiostatin in bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells (17Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Integrin αvβ3 is a receptor for a wide variety of extracellular matrix ligands including vitronectin, fibronectin, and fibrinogen. Endothelial cells exposed to growth factors or undergoing angiogenesis in tumors, wounds, or inflammatory tissue, express high levels of αvβ3 (Ref. 18Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar and references therein). The expression of αvβ3 on activated endothelial cells suggests that this integrin may have an important function in angiogenesis as well as in developmental neovascularization. In fact, the disruption of αvβ3 ligation with antibody LM609 or peptide antagonists of αvβ3 affects blood vessel formation. These antagonists perturb the growth and/or maturation of new blood vessels without detectably influencing the preexisting blood vessels. In tumor models, the inhibition of blood vessels by αv integrin antagonists not only blocked tumor-associated angiogenesis but in some cases caused tumor regression (3Brooks P. Montgomery A. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R., Hu, T. Klier G. Cheresh D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2184) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that angiostatin potentially perturbs the critical αvβ3-mediated signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Consistent with this idea, we have shown that angiostatin does not induce stress fiber formation on αvβ3 binding (17Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Several previous reports suggest that plasmin, a serine protease and the parent molecule of angiostatin, transduces signaling (e.g. protein phosphorylation, Ca2+mobilization, and phospholipase C and protein kinase C activation) (19Schafer A.I. Adelman B. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 20Schafer A.I. Maas A.K. Ware J.A. Johnson P.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Salzman E.W. J. Clin.

Plasmin has also been reported to induce the migration of human peripheral blood monocytes (23Syrovets T. Tippler B. Rieks M. Simmet T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we demonstrate that plasmin specifically binds to integrin αvβ3through its kringle domains like angiostatin. In addition, we found that plasmin induced the migration of endothelial cells. This activity of plasmin required both an interaction with αvβ3 and the catalytic activity of plasmin. Angiostatin, anti-αvβ3 agents, and a serine protease inhibitor effectively blocked plasmin-induced cell migration. We propose that plasmin signaling is a potential target for angiostatin. Human Glu-plasminogen, the native circulating form of the molecule, was isolated from fresh human plasma by affinity chromatography on Lys-Sepharose and molecular exclusion chromatography as described previously (24Parmer R.J.

We coated wells of 96-well Immulon-2 microtiter plates (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing substrates at a concentration of 50–500 nm and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. We blocked remaining protein binding sites by incubating with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Calbiochem) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells (105 cells/well) in 100 μl of Hepes-Tyrode buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.4 mmNaH2PO4, 2.5 mm KCl, 0.1% glucose, 0.02% bovine serum albumin) supplemented with 2 mmMgCl2 were added to the wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h unless stated otherwise. After nonbound cells were removed by rinsing the wells with the same buffer, bound cells were quantified by measuring endogenous phosphatase activity. Antibodies were used at a 250-fold dilution of ascites (KH72) or at 4 μg/ml (LM609, Y9A2, and mAb 51). RGD- and RGE-peptides were used at 100 μm. ε-Aminocaproic acid (EACA) was used at 200 mm. The substrates and their coating concentrations for testing stress fiber formation were poly-l-lysine (50 μg/ml), angiostatin (fragment K1-3, 500 nm), plasmin (200 nm), soluble K1-3 (4 μm), and fibronectin (5 μg/ml). Cell migration was analyzed using tissue culture-treated 24-well Transwell plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) with polycarbonate membranes of pore size 8 μm. The lower side of the filter was coated with various concentrations (20–200 nm) of substrates. Coated filters were placed into serum-free migration buffer (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 10 mm Hepes, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 1× penicillin-streptomycin), and cells (100 μl) suspended in the same buffer (8 × 105cells/ml) were added to the upper chamber. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 20 h. Cells in the upper chamber were removed by wiping out gently, and cells that migrated to the lower surface of the filters were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 2% ethanol and then were counted. The result at each well is the mean cell number of four randomly selected high magnification microscopic fields in triplicate experiments. In some cases, anti-integrin antibodies (10 μg/ml) or angiostatin (4 μm) were incubated with cells for 15 min prior to the assay. When the effect of aprotinin on plasmin-induced cell migration was tested, aprotinin (50 μg/ml) was mixed with plasmin solution and the mixture was used for coating. We added bFGF to both the upper and lower chambers at the concentration of 50 ng/ml. We used soluble angiostatin-(K1-3) at 4 μm. The concentrations of substrates (angiostatin-(K1-3) and plasmin) in Fig. 3 are 200 nm for β3-CHO cells and 50 nm for BAE cells. We carried out flow cytometric analysis and stress fiber staining as described previously (17Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Because αvβ3 on endothelial cells binds to angiostatin but not to plasminogen (17Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), it is probable that proteolysis of plasminogen to angiostatin exposes the integrin binding sites in the kringle domains. We tested whether proteolytic activation of plasminogen to plasmin similarly exposes the integrin binding sites. We found that plasmin supported adhesion of β3-CHO cells but did not support adhesion of mock-transfected CHO cells (Fig.1a). Although anti-αvβ3 mAb LM609 completely blocked the adhesion of β3-CHO cells to plasmin, control anti-integrin α5 (KH72) did not (Fig. 1b). RGD-peptide completely blocked adhesion of β3-CHO cells to plasmin, but control RGE-peptide did not block, suggesting that αvβ3 binds to plasmin in an RGD-dependent manner, although the RGD sequence is not present in plasmin. This also indicates that the integrin binding sites within the kringle domain of plasminogen are exposed by proteolytic activation of plasminogen to plasmin. BAE cells constitutively express integrins αvβ3 and α9β1 on their surface, and both integrins bind to angiostatin (17Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). BAE cells adhered to plasmin at a level higher than that of β3-CHO cells (Fig. 1a). LM609 effectively blocked adhesion of BAE cells to plasmin (Fig.1c), but Y9A2 (anti-α9) had only a minimal effect, suggesting that αvβ3 may be a predominant receptor for plasmin on BAE cells. The kringle domains of plasminogen have multiple Lys binding sites (30Castellino F.J. McCance S.G. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 212: 46-60PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that a Lys-analogue, EACA, completely blocked the adhesion of BAE cells to angiostatin (17Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). We found that EACA effectively blocked plasmin binding to αvβ3 (Fig. 1,b and c). Furthermore, a mAb against plasminogen kringles (mAb 51) blocked the interaction between plasmin and these integrins (Fig. 1, b and c). These results suggest that plasmin specifically binds to αvβ3 through the kringle domains as in the case of angiostatin. We previously reported that angiostatin did not induce cell spreading or stress fiber formation (17Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast to angiostatin, we found that plasmin induced cell spreading and stress fiber formation in β3-CHO and BAE cells (Fig.2, a–d), indicating that plasmin transduced signals upon binding to integrins. Interestingly, angiostatin effectively blocked spreading and stress fiber formation by these cells. These results suggest that angiostatin may block plasmin-dependent signal transduction. Migration of endothelial cells is critically involved in angiogenesis (1Griffioen A.W. Molema G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 237-268PubMed Google Scholar, 31Eliceiri B.P. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). It has been reported that plasmin is a potent chemoattractant for human peripheral monocytes (23Syrovets T. Tippler B. Rieks M. Simmet T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We studied whether plasmin induces cell migration in an integrin-dependent manner using a modified Boyden chamber assay. Notably, plasmin induced the migration of β3-CHO and BAE cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3, a and c). Mock-transfected CHO cells migrated at a much lower rate. In contrast to plasmin, angiostatin or plasminogen did not induce the migration of these cells (Fig. 3, b and d). It has been reported that the angiogenic growth factor bFGF increases the expression levels and the activity of several integrins including αvβ3 (32Klein S. Giancotti F. Presta M. Albelda S. Buck C. Rifkin D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 33Yeh C.H. Peng H.C. Huang T.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 34Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Pampori N. Thomas K.A. Bett A. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that bFGF significantly enhanced the plasmin-induced migration of β3-CHO and BAE cells (Fig. 3, b andd). We tested the effect of several antagonists to integrins and plasmin on plasmin-induced cell migration. We found that LM609 effectively blocked plasmin-induced migration of β3-CHO and BAE cells indicating that αvβ3 is critical for plasmin-induced migration. We found that integrin α9β1 is also involved in plasmin-induced migration of BAE cells (data not shown) and that combined LM609 and Y9A2 mAbs more effectively block plasmin-induced migration of BAE cells (Fig. 3d) than LM609 alone. Although both angiostatin and plasmin bind to integrin αvβ3 through their kringle domains, angiostatin did not induce cell migration. Thus, we hypothesized that angiostatin may be an inhibitor of plasmin-induced cell migration. Notably, we found that soluble angiostatin effectively blocked plasmin-induced migration of β3-CHO and BAE cells in the presence of bFGF (Fig. 3,b and d). Interestingly, aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor, effectively blocked the migration of these cells on plasmin (Fig. 3, band d), suggesting that the catalytic activity of plasmin may be important for plasmin-induced cell migration. Taken together, these results suggest that plasmin-induced migration is dependent on the integrins and the catalytic activity of plasmin, and that blocking plasmin-induced migration of endothelial cells may be a potential mechanism by which angiostatin can exert its effects. To study the role of kringle domains in integrin binding and cell migration, we tested the ability of mini-plasmin, which has only a single kringle domain (K5), to bind to αvβ3 and to induce the migration of β3-CHO cells. When compared with plasmin, a much higher coating concentration of mini-plasmin was required for mini-plasmin to support the adhesion of β3-CHO cells (Fig.4a), suggesting that mini-plasmin has a much lower affinity for αvβ3 than plasmin. The coating concentrations that provide half-maximal adhesion are 50–100 nm for plasmin and K1-3 and >400 nm for mini-plasmin (Fig. 4a). Consistently, mini-plasmin did not induce cell migration at the concentrations where plasmin induced cell migration (100 nm). However, mini-plasmin induced cell migration at higher concentrations (500–1000 nm) and reached a level several times higher than with plasmin (Fig. 4b). These results suggest that a single kringle domain is able to bind to αvβ3 and is sufficient to support the signaling function of the catalytic domain of plasmin. It is probable that the number of the kringle domains per molecule may affect the level of the catalytic domain, which mediates signaling, on the cell surface. Previously, we have shown that angiostatin binds to integrin αvβ3, whereas plasminogen does not (17Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The present results establish that plasmin, like angiostatin, binds to integrin αvβ3 through the kringle domains as well. These results suggest that the integrin binding sites in the kringle domains are exposed by proteolytic activation of plasminogen to plasmin. It should be noted that the kringle domain of plasmin is still attached to the catalytic domain by interchain disulfide linkage. We have shown that plasmin induced the spreading and stress fiber formation of β3-CHO and BAE cells. This is in sharp contrast to angiostatin, which did not induce spreading and stress fiber formation (17Tarui T. Miles L.A. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that plasmin induced the migration of β3-CHO and BAE cells. Interestingly, plasmin-induced cell migration required integrin αvβ3 as well as the catalytic activity of plasmin. Importantly, we have shown that angiostatin effectively blocked plasmin-induced spreading, stress fiber formation, and migration of β3-CHO and BAE cells. The present findings suggest that blocking the plasmin signaling in endothelial cells may be a potential mechanism by which angiostatin exerts its effects (Fig.5a). Several previous reports suggest that plasmin transduces signaling. Plasmin causes platelet aggregation and secretion associated with protein phosphorylation, Ca2+ mobilization, and phospholipase C and protein kinase C activation (20Schafer A.I. Maas A.K. Ware J.A. Johnson P.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Salzman E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Plasmin increases arachidonate release in bovine artery endothelial cells in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner (21Chang W.C. Shi G.Y. Chow Y.H. Chang L.C. Hau J.S. Lin M.T. Jen C.J. Wing L.Y. Wu H.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C271-C281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it triggers a release of leukotriene B4 in peripheral monocytes (22Weide I. Tippler B. Syrovets T. Simmet T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These processes required the lysine binding sites and the intact catalytic center of plasmin and a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein. Plasmin induces chemotaxis of human peripheral monocytes, and this requires the catalytic activity of plasmin (23Syrovets T. Tippler B. Rieks M. Simmet T. Blood. 1997; 89: 4574-4583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, how plasmin transduces signals has not been established. Many studies have suggested that several serine proteases (e.g. thrombin and trypsin) transduce signals through cleavage of specific cell surface receptors (e.g. thrombin receptor), members of the G protein-coupled, seven-transmembrane domain receptor family termed proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) (for review see Ref. 35Macfarlane S.R. Seatter M.J. Kanke T. Hunter G.D. Plevin R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 245-282PubMed Google Scholar). Four members of the PAR family, PARs-1, -2, -3, and -4, have been identified. PARs are cleaved by serine proteinases within the extracellular N terminus, allowing the new N terminus to bind and activate the receptors themselves. PAR-1 and PAR-3 are effectively activated by thrombin. In contrast, PAR-2 is activated by trypsin but not by thrombin. As with other G protein-coupled receptors, activated PARs induce G protein-mediated signal transduction, stimulating the generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, intracellular calcium mobilization, arachidonic acid release, and prostaglandin secretion. It has recently been reported that plasmin transduces signaling through PAR-1 (thrombin receptor) on the cell surface (36Pendurthi, U., Andrade-Gordon, P., and Rao, L. (2001) Thromb. Haemostasis86, (suppl.)Google Scholar). Thus, PAR-1 may be a probable candidate signal transducer from plasmin in endothelial cells. It has been reported that plasmin has a much lower affinity for PAR-1 than thrombin. The Kd of plasmin for PAR-1 is >10-fold higher than that of thrombin (37Altrogge L.M. Monard D. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of PAR-1 would be possible only when plasmin is concentrated on the cell surface. The binding of plasmin to αvβ3 would significantly increase the plasmin concentration on the surface. Therefore, the expression and activation of αvβ3 may be required for plasmin-induced cell migration. Endothelial cells exposed to growth factors or those undergoing angiogenesis in tumors, wounds, or inflammatory tissue, express high levels of αvβ3(Ref. 18Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar and references therein). It has been reported that vascular endothelial growth factor and bFGF increase the affinity of several integrins including αvβ3 (34Byzova T.V. Goldman C.K. Pampori N. Thomas K.A. Bett A. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 851-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that bFGF increases the amount and the activity of several integrins including αvβ3 (32Klein S. Giancotti F. Presta M. Albelda S. Buck C. Rifkin D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 33Yeh C.H. Peng H.C. Huang T.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consistently, we have shown that bFGF stimulated plasmin-induced migration in β3-CHO and BAE cells. It is probable that plasmin binding to integrin αvβ3may also prevent inactivation of plasmin. It has been reported that circulating abundant α2-anti-plasmin rapidly inactivates free plasmin through binding to the kringle domain of plasmin (for review see Ref. 38Lijnen H.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The binding of plasmin to integrins through the kringle domain may prevent inactivation of plasmin by occupying α2-anti-plasmin binding sites. In addition, urokinase-type plasminogen activator and the urokinase receptor (CD87) are not expressed by quiescent endothelium but are expressed in endothelium during angiogenesis (for review Ref. 39Ghiso J.A. Alonso D.F. Farias E.F. Gomez D.E. de Kier Joffe E.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Taken together, the increased expression and affinity of αvβ3, the increased plasmin activation on the cell surface, and the increased plasmin stability by binding to integrins may increase the cell surface plasmin concentration and may lead to plasmin-mediated PAR-1 activation and subsequent cell migration in activated endothelial cells (Fig.5a). We have demonstrated that angiostatin effectively blocked plasmin-induced spreading, stress fiber formation, and migration of BAE and β3-CHO cells. It is probable that angiostatin may compete with plasmin for binding to integrin αvβ3, because they share common integrin binding sites, the kringle domains. We propose that angiostatin may block accumulation of plasmin on the cell surface and block subsequent signaling. It is possible that angiostatin may facilitate inactivation of plasmin by blocking plasmin binding to integrins. We have also demonstrated that mini-plasmin (K5 + the catalytic domain) induced the migration of β3-CHO cells to a much greater extent than plasmin, although mini-plasmin showed much weaker affinity for integrins and higher concentrations of mini-plasmin were required to observe migration. These results can be well explained taking into account that plasmin has multiple (five) and mini-plasmin has only a single integrin binding site in K5. If a plasmin molecule binds to multiple integrins through the kringle domains, several integrin molecules on the cell surface potentially could bind to the kringle domains of plasmin. Thus, αvβ3 would be saturated with plasmin, and the concentration of catalytic domains on the cell surface may not increase as the plasmin concentration increases. In contrast, because mini-plasmin has only a single kringle domain, the catalytic domains would reach a level higher than with plasmin before all of the integrins are saturated. We suspect that angiostatin with multiple kringles/integrin binding sites could effectively saturate αvβ3 on the cell surface without inducing signals and block the accumulation of plasmin on the cell surface (Fig.5b). It has been established that anti-αvβ3 antibodies (e.g. LM609) and RGD-peptide or related compounds block angiogenesis (Refs. 40Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Klemke R. Visscher D. Sarkar F.H. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar and 41Friedlander M. Brooks P.C. Shaffer R.W. Kincaid C.M. Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1500-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar and references therein) and that serine protease inhibitors (e.g. anti-thrombin) (42O'Reilly M.S. Pirie-Shepherd S. Lane W.S. Folkman J. Science. 1999; 285: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) effectively block cancer proliferation. How these agents exert anti-angiogenic function is unclear. Interestingly, these inhibitors blocked plasmin-induced migration of endothelial cells in the present study. The present results suggest that plasmin-induced cell migration may be a potential target for these anti-angiogenic agents as well (Fig.5a). We thank D. Cheresh, S. Chien, A. Hanneken, K.

It has been suggested that glutamate formed from α-ketoglutarate is a messenger of the amplifying pathway (Maechler, P., and Wollheim, C. B. (1999) Nature 402, 685–689). This hypothesis was tested with mouse islets depolarized with 30 mm KCl (+ diazoxide) or with a saturating concentration of sulfonylurea. Because [Ca2+]i was elevated under these conditions, insulin secretion was stimulated already in 0 mm glucose. The amplification of secretion produced by glucose was accompanied by an increase in islet glutamate. However, glutamine (0.5–2 mm) markedly augmented islet glutamate without affecting insulin secretion, whereas glucose augmented secretion without influencing glutamate levels when these were elevated by glutamine. Allosteric activation of glutamate dehydrogenase by BCH (2-amino 2-norbornane carboxylic acid) lowered islet glutamate but increased insulin secretion. Similar insulin secretion thus occurred at very different cellular glutamate levels. Glutamine did not affect islet [Ca2+]i and pHi, whereas glucose and BCH slightly raised pHi and either slightly decreased (30 mm KCl) or increased (tolbutamide) [Ca2+]i. The general dissociation between changes in islet glutamate and insulin secretion refutes a role of β-cell glutamate in the amplification of insulin secretion by glucose. Glucose increases insulin secretion by raising cytoplasmic Ca2+([Ca2+]i) in β-cells (triggering pathway) and augmenting the efficacy of Ca2+ on exocytosis (amplifying pathway). It has been suggested that glutamate formed from α-ketoglutarate is a messenger of the amplifying pathway (Maechler, P., and Wollheim, C. B. (1999) Nature 402, 685–689).

ATP-sensitive K+ channel cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration glutamate dehydrogenase glutamate decarboxylase cytoplasmic pH 2-amino 2-norbornane carboxylic acid Tight control of insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells is critical for glucose homeostasis. This control is exerted by a number of physiological agents, among which circulating nutrients, in particular glucose, play a central role. Glucose regulation of insulin secretion involves two major signaling pathways leading to the production of triggering and amplifying signals respectively (1Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The triggering pathway consists in a now well accepted cascade of events. The metabolism of glucose by oxidative glycolysis causes a rise in the ATP/ADP ratio, which closes ATP-sensitive K+(K+-ATP)1channels. The resulting decrease in K+ conductance leads to membrane depolarization, with subsequent opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space, and rise in the concentration of free cytoplasmic Ca2+([Ca2+]i), which triggers the exocytosis of insulin granules (2Rorsman P. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 3Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 4Seino S.

Ravier M.A. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51 Suppl. 1: S144-S151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the triggering action of Ca2+ does not completely explain the stimulation of insulin secretion by glucose. Amplifying signals are also produced in β-cells, and these augment the magnitude of the secretory response, in particular during the sustained phase of stimulation (8Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 9Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin.

Whereas the importance of this pathway is now undisputed (1Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar), the underlying mechanisms remain controversial (1Henquin J.C.

The present study was prompted by the current controversy surrounding the hypothesis that intracellular glutamate, formed through amination of α-ketoglutarate by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), may serve as second messenger in this amplifying pathway (17Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The hypothesis was originally based on the observations that glutamate increased insulin release from permeabilized INS-1 cells perifused with elevated fixed concentrations of Ca2+ and ATP, that glucose increased insulinoma and islet cell glutamate content, and that a membrane-permeant ester of glutamate increased insulin secretion from intact cells (17Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the hypothesis was contradicted by reports suggesting that glucose does not affect glutamate levels in islets from ob/ob mice (18Danielsson A. Hellman B. Idahl L.A. Horm. Metab. Res. 1970; 2: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Gylfe E. Hellman B. Endocrinology. 1974; 94: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or rats (20MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34025-34027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and in insulinoma cells (15Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, the ability of glutamate dimethyl ester to increase insulin secretion has been attributed to its use as a nutrient by β-cells (21Sener A. Conget I. Rasschaert J. Leclercq-Meyer V. Villanueva- Peñacarrillo M.L. Valverde I. Malaisse W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: E573-E584PubMed Google Scholar). Manipulations of the genes coding for glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and for GDH have also yielded conflicting results. Overexpression of GAD65 in INS-1E cells increased the enzyme activity 26-fold, lowered cell glutamate content by ∼40%, but inhibited insulin secretion (40%) at 15 mm glucose only, being without effect at 2.5 and 7.5 mm glucose (22Rubi B. Ishihara H. Hegardt F.G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36391-36396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Overexpression of GAD65 in rat islet cells did not affect insulin secretion in response to 8.3 mmglucose but inhibited the sustained response to 16.7 mmglucose (22Rubi B. Ishihara H. Hegardt F.G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36391-36396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These results were considered to support the role of glutamate in glucose-induced insulin secretion. In contrast, transgenic mice overexpressing GAD65 in β-cells, normally released insulin in response to high glucose; the only defect was an inhibition of first phase insulin release induced by 7 mm glucose. The study was considered not to support the glutamate hypothesis (23Shi Y. Kanaani J. Menard-Rose V., Ma, Y.H. Chang P.Y. Hanahan D. Tobin A. Grodsky G. Baekkeskov S. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 279: E684-E694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of GDH in INS-1E cells increased human growth hormone release (reporter of insulin release by transfected cells) induced by high glucose without affecting basal release. It was assumed, not verified, that the overexpressed enzyme was working in the direction of α-ketoglutarate to glutamate and thus increasing the concentration of glutamate (24Maechler P.

Conversely, overexpression of a mutated, constitutively active GDH in MIN6 cells increased insulin release at low glucose without affecting the response to high glucose. It was now assumed that the enzyme worked in the opposite direction and thus lowered cell glutamate content (25Tanizawa Y. Nakai K. Sasaki T. Anno T. Ohta Y. Inoue H. Matsuo K. Koga M. Furukawa S. Oka Y. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Glutamine markedly increases islet glutamate content (20MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. J. Biol.

J. 1984; 219: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This lack of effect on insulin secretion is explained by the inability of glutamine alone to produce enough ATP to close K+-ATP channels, depolarize the membrane, and raise [Ca2+]i in β-cells (26Malaisse W.J.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1535-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It would not be correct, however, to use the foregoing data, all obtained under conditions testing the triggering pathway of insulin secretion, to refute the glutamate hypothesis, which clearly restricts the role of glutamate to the amplifying pathway (16Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Diabetes. 2002; 51 Suppl. 1: S37-S42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Virtually nothing has been done to test the hypothesis adequately. Islet glutamate content has not been measured under conditions where the amplifying pathway was being studied. Moreover, the available insulin secretion data are limited to two reports showing that in a medium containing 30–50 mm K+, 250 μm diazoxide, and no glucose, 10–20 mm glutamine has little or no effect on insulin secretion, unless, again, if GDH, is activated (9Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 32Yamada S. Komatsu M. Sato Y. Yamauchi K. Aizawa T. Hashizume K. Endocr. J. 2001; 48: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This poor effect of glutamine alone has tentatively been ascribed to an alleged alkalinization of the β-cell cytoplasm (16Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Diabetes. 2002; 51 Suppl. 1: S37-S42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The explanation deserves verification because an independent study suggested that glucose-induced priming of insulin secretion, which is thought to be mediated by the amplifying pathway (13Komatsu M. Sato Y. Aizawa T. Hashizume K. Endocr. J. 2001; 48: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), is indeed inhibited by β-cell alkalinization (33Gunawardana S.C. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present study, mouse islets were thus incubated or perifused under depolarizing conditions (high K+ or sulfonylurea) to study the effects of glucose, glutamine, and BCH to activate GDH, on the amplifying pathway of insulin secretion. Glutamate was measured in the same islets, and possible changes in [Ca2+]i and pHi were checked for in parallel experiments. A control series of tests was also performed with rat islets to validate our conclusions in a second species. The control medium was a bicarbonate-buffered solution containing (mm): NaCl, 120; KCl, 4.8; CaCl2, 2.5; MgCl2, 1.2; and NaHCO3, 24. It was maintained under O2/CO2 (94:6) to a pH of 7.4, and it contained 10 mm glucose and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. A similar solution was used as test medium after adjustment of the glucose concentration and addition of the studied substances. When the concentration of KCl was increased to 30 mm, that of NaCl was decreased accordingly; otherwise the substances were added without osmotic compensation. Glutamine (Microselect) was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland), diazoxide was a gift of Schering-Plough Avondale (Rathdrum, Ireland), BCH, tolbutamide, and glibenclamide were from Sigma. Other reagents were from Merck AG (Darmstadt, Germany). The experiments were performed with overnight-cultured mouse islets and freshly isolated rat islets. Mouse islets were aseptically isolated by collagenase digestion of the pancreas of female NMRI mice (25–30 g) followed by hand selection. The islets were then cultured for about 18 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Rat islets were isolated by collagenase digestion of the pancreas of male Wistar rats (300–320 g). They were used immediately after isolation. Cultured mouse islets and freshly isolated rat islets were preincubated for 60 min at 37 °C in control medium containing 10 mm glucose. They were then distributed in batches of 12, at room temperature, in control medium containing 3 mmglucose. Each batch was transferred into an Eppendorf conical tube containing 750 μl of test medium and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the tubes were gently (10 s) centrifuged, 700 μl of medium were removed and saved for insulin measurement, and 700 μl of cold control medium were added. After gentle shaking to ensure good rinsing of the islets, the tubes were again briefly centrifuged, and 700 μl of medium were removed and discarded. On the islets and the remaining 50 μl of medium, 200 μl of an acid-ethanol mixture (34Detimary P. Jonas J.C. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1738-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were added. The samples were then sonicated and frozen until glutamate assay. Blanks without islets were run in parallel and treated exactly as samples. Cultured mouse islets were also studied using a dynamic system of perifusion (35Henquin J.C. Nature. 1978; 271: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). After preincubation as described above and distribution in batches of 15, the islets were transferred into perifusion chambers. They were then perifused at 37 °C with test solutions described in the figure legends. The effluent fractions were collected at 2-min intervals and saved for insulin assay. At the end of the experiment the perifusion was stopped, the chamber was opened, and the islets were recovered, rinsed twice in cold control medium, and transferred in Eppendorf tubes with 50 μl of medium. After addition of 200 μl of acid-ethanol mixture, the samples were processed as above. Cultured mouse islets were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura-PE3 (2 μm, 3 h) or the pH indicator BCECF (2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (0.5 μm, 1 h) in control medium containing 10 mm glucose. Loaded islets were then transferred (3–4 at a time) into the perifusion chamber of a spectrofluorimetric system with which [Ca2+]i and pHi were measured as described previously (36Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20713-20720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,37Shepherd R.M. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7915-7921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Insulin in the incubation or perifusion medium was measured by radioimmunoassay using rat insulin as a standard. Glutamate in the islet extracts was measured by an high performance liquid chromatography system (Beckman) using ortho-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) derivatization. 40 μl of islet extract were diluted 5-fold with water, mixed with 70 μl of an OPA-2-mercaptoethanol-derivatizing solution, and injected 1 min later using a Gilson automatic sample injector (model 231-401) with a fixed 20-min injection cycle. The separation and identification of glutamate was performed as described previously, with minor modifications (38Pin J.P. Weiss S. Sebben M. Kemp D.E. Bockaert J. J. Neurochem. 1986; 47: 594-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,39Bertrand G. Puech R. Loubatieres-Mariani M.M. Bockaert J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E551-E556PubMed Google Scholar). The peak area of glutamate was determined with the Gold system (Beckman), and the glutamate concentration was calculated by comparison with external standards treated like samples. Only traces or no glutamate was detected in blanks without islets, except when the incubation or perifusion medium contained glutamine. All commercial preparations of glutamine tested contained small quantities of glutamate. The contamination by exogenous glutamate after rinsing was about 10% of the islet glutamate content and was corrected for. All experiments have been performed with islets from 3–6 different preparations. Results are presented as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between means was assessed by analysis of variance followed by a Newman-Keuls test for multiple comparisons and by Student’st test in a few cases. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. In the first series of experiments, batches of mouse islets were incubated with 2 μm glibenclamide, a concentration of sulfonylurea that completely blocks K+-ATP channels (3Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 40Zu¨nkler B.J. Lenzen S. Ma¨nner K. Panten U. Trube G. Arch. Pharmacol. 1988; 337: 225-230Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 41Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement J.P. Gonzalez G. Kunjilwar K. Babenko A. Bryan J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Insulin secretion was stimulated in the absence of glucose (1.39 ± 0.12 ng·h−1·islet−1versus0.27 ± 0.02 ng·h−1·islet−1 without glibenclamide) and was further increased by the presence of 3 mm glucose (2.00 ± 0.28 ng·h−1·islet−1, p < 0.05) and 20 mm glucose (7.41 ± 0.61 ng·h−1·islet−1, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1). This additional effect of glucose reflects the amplifying action of the sugar (1Henquin J.C. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1751-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). The glutamate content of the islets incubated in 0 mm glucose and 2 μm glibenclamide averaged 4.67 ± 0.45 pmol·islet−1. It increased 1.4-fold (p< 0.05) and 2.6-fold (p < 0.001) in the presence of 3 and 20 mm glucose, respectively (Fig. 1). Thus, there was a parallel (but not proportional) increase in islet glutamate content and insulin secretion under these conditions. When glutamine (0.5 and 2 mm) was added to the medium containing 2 μm glibenclamide, a concentration-dependent increase in islet glutamate content was observed (Fig. 1). As compared with control islets, this increase was particularly large (3- to 5-fold) in 0 and 3 mmglucose, whereas insulin secretion was at the most doubled by 2 mm glutamine in 3 mm glucose (Fig. 1). There was no significant effect of glutamine on insulin secretion in the other conditions. For example, the 2-fold increase in glutamate content induced by 0.5 mm glutamine in 0 or 3 mmglucose, or by 2 mm glutamine in 20 mm glucose was not accompanied by significant changes in insulin secretion (Fig.1). The situation was strikingly different in the presence of BCH, an activator of glutamate dehydrogenase (28Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Nature. 1980; 288: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 42Panten U. Langer J. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). BCH lowered the islet glutamate content by about 50% in 0 and 3 mm glucose while increasing insulin secretion 2-fold (Fig. 1). When BCH and glutamine were combined, the elevation of islet glutamate normally produced by glutamine was attenuated, but insulin secretion was amplified except in 20 mm glucose, where BCH lowered islet glutamate without affecting insulin secretion (Fig. 1). A second approach to studying the amplifying action of glucose on insulin secretion consists in holding K+-ATP channels open with diazoxide and elevating β-cell [Ca2+]i by depolarizing the membrane with 30 mm K+ (8Gembal M. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, insulin secretion was stimulated even in the absence of glucose (2.29 ± 0.17 ng·h−1·islet−1) and was further increased by 3 mm glucose (3.31 ± 0.25 ng·h−1·islet−1, p < 0.05) and 20 mm glucose (8.26 ± 0.43 ng·h−1·islet−1, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2). The glutamate content of the islets incubated in 0 mm glucose and 30 mmK+ averaged 6.15 ± 0.53 pmol·islet−1. It increased 35% (p < 0.05 by Student’s ttest only) and 132% (p < 0.001) in the presence of 3 and 20 mm glucose, respectively (Fig. 2). Glutamine consistently elevated islet glutamate content above controls (from 35% by 0.5 mm glutamine in 20 mm glucose to 400% by 2 mm glutamine in 0 mm glucose). However, the only significant effect on insulin secretion was a 50% increase produced by 2 mm glutamine in 0 mmglucose (Fig. 2). Again, the contrast with BCH was striking. BCH alone amplified insulin secretion (50–70%) at 0 and 3 mmglucose while lowering islet glutamate by 65%. When BCH was combined with glutamine the rise in islet glutamate was attenuated, but the increase in insulin secretion was even larger (Fig. 2). When insulin secretion and the islet glutamate content were compared in the different experimental conditions tested at each glucose concentration (each panel of Figs. 1 and 2), no correlation was ever found. However, when the analysis focused on the differences between 0, 3, and 20 mm glucose, a significant correlation was found for control islets and for islets incubated in the presence of BCH (Fig. 3). There was no correlation in the presence of 0.5 (Fig. 3) or 2 mm glutamine alone (not shown). Correlative arguments for and against the glutamate hypothesis can thus be obtained with this commonly used technique of incubation. The weakness of the approach is that the correlation is made between insulin secreted during the whole incubation and the concentration of an islet metabolite at one single late time point. We therefore also used a dynamic system of perifusion to permit closer comparison of the islet glutamate content with the actual rate of insulin secretion. The islets were perifused with a medium containing 7 mm glucose and a concentration of tolbutamide (500 μm) that also completely blocks K+-ATP channels (3Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 903-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 40Zu¨nkler B.J. Lenzen S. Ma¨nner K. Panten U. Trube G. Arch. Pharmacol. 1988; 337: 225-230Crossref Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 41Aguilar-Bryan L. Clement J.P. Gonzalez G. Kunjilwar K. Babenko A. Bryan J. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 227-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Under these conditions the rate of insulin secretion slightly declined with time (Fig. 4A) but remained well above (5–7-fold) the basal rate in the presence of 3 mmglucose alone. Addition of 0.5 mm glutamine to the medium increased the islet glutamate content 2.2-fold without influencing insulin secretion (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, BCH lowered islet glutamate and increased insulin secretion ∼4-fold. The combination of glutamine and BCH increased insulin secretion 5-fold without changing islet glutamate as compared with controls. Raising the concentration of glucose from 7 to 20 mm also strongly amplified insulin secretion without changing islet glutamate. Thus, there was no correlation between islet glutamate content and the actual rate of insulin secretion at the same moment (Fig. 4B). We also compared the influence of the different test agents on islet [Ca2+]i and pHi (Fig. 5). During continuous depolarization with either a high concentration of sulfonylurea or a high concentration of extracellular K+, apparent islet [Ca2+]i slowly but steadily increases at a rate of approximately 2 nm/min (43Sato Y. Anello M. Henquin J.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2252-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This trend must be taken into account when assessing possible effects of test agents. A similar increase was observed in this series during perifusion of control islets with 7 mm glucose and 500 μm tolbutamide (Fig. 5, A andB). For all islets tested under these conditions (n = 65), i.e. during the 5-min period preceding application of test substances, average [Ca2+]i was 214 ± 2 nm, well above basal [Ca2+]i in 3 mmglucose alone (∼70–90 nm, data not shown). Glutamine (0.5 mm) did not affect [Ca2+]i, whereas BCH alone, BCH combined with glutamine, and a rise in the glucose concentration to 20 mm all produced similar changes, described previously for glucose (43Sato Y. Anello M. Henquin J.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2252-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and characterized by a small transient decrease followed by an increase slightly above control values (Fig. 5, A andB). The impact of the same substances on islet pHiis shown in Fig. 5, C and D. For all islets, pHi in the presence of 7 mm glucose and 500 μm tolbutamide, i.e. during the 5-min period before application of any test agent, averaged 6.96 ± 0.01 (n = 55). Addition of glutamine alone had no effect, whereas BCH (either alone or in combination with glutamine) and high glucose caused a slight increase in pHi (Fig.5). When perifused mouse islets are stimulated with 30 mmK+ in the presence of 3 mm glucose and diazoxide, an initial large peak of insulin secretion is followed by a progressive decline of the secretory rate (9Gembal M. Detimary P. Gilon P. Gao Z.Y. Henquin J.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 871-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Only this decline is shown in Fig. 6. Raising the glucose concentration to 20 mm stopped this spontaneous evolution and amplified insulin secretion while augmenting islet glutamate levels. Addition of 0.5 or 2 mm glutamine to the medium failed to influence insulin secretion, although islet glutamate was increased severalfold. In contrast, BCH alone or combined with 0.5 mm glutamine markedly increased insulin secretion while lowering islet glutamate content (Fig. 6). Thus, there was no correlation between islet glutamate and the rate of insulin secretion at the same moment (Fig. 6). During steady state depolarization with 30 mmK+ in the presence of 3 mm glucose and 250 μm diazoxide, [Ca2+]i was elevated, averaging 286 ± 4 nm for the period of 25–30 min in all islets (n = 84). As already mentioned above, [Ca2+]i slowly increased with time under control conditions (Fig. 7). Raising the concentration of glucose to 20 mm caused a rapid decrease in [Ca2+]i followed by an incomplete recovery so that [Ca2+]i remained below control values during the period of 40–45 min (Fig. 7, A andB). A similar biphasic decrease in [Ca2+]i occurred upon addition of BCH alone or together with 0.5 mm glutamine. In contrast, glutamine alone, at 0.5 or 2 mm, was without effect on [Ca2+]i (Fig. 7, A andB). In these depolar"

Mutants lacking the YBR159w gene display many of the phenotypes that have previously been described for mutants with defects in fatty acid elongation. These phenotypes include reduced VLCFA synthesis, accumulation of high levels of dihydrosphingosine and phytosphingosine, and accumulation of medium-chain ceramides. In vitro elongation assays confirm that the ybr159Delta mutant is deficient in the reduction of the 3-ketoacyl intermediates of fatty acid elongation. The ybr159Delta mutant also displays reduced dehydration of the 3-OH acyl intermediates of fatty acid elongation, suggesting that Ybr159p is required for the stability or function of the dehydratase activity of the elongase system. Green fluorescent protein-tagged Ybr159p co-localizes and co-immunoprecipitates with other elongating enzymes, Elo3p and Tsc13p. Whereas VLCFA synthesis is essential for viability, the ybr159Delta mutant cells are viable (albeit very slowly growing) and do synthesize some VLCFA. This suggested that a functional ortholog of Ybr159p exists that is responsible for the residual 3-ketoreductase activity. By disrupting the orthologs of Ybr159w in the ybr159Delta mutant we found that the ybr159Deltaayr1Delta double mutant was inviable, suggesting that Ayr1p is responsible for the residual 3-ketoreductase activity."

Aβ is generated by proteolysis of the ∼100-kDa amyloid precursor protein (APP),1 a broadly expressed type 1 transmembrane protein that is found primarily in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and at the cell surface (reviewed in Ref. 1De Strooper B. Annaert W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1857-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β-cleavage of APP occurs within the luminal/extracellular domain of APP and generates two APP fragments: a large, soluble amino-terminal fragment (sAPPβ) that is secreted from the cell and a transmembrane, carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTF) that remains associated with the cell. This βCTF consists of 99 amino acids, contains the whole Aβ peptide, and has a molecular mass of ∼10 kDa. An alternative pathway involves the cleavage of APP 16 residues downstream of this site at the α-cleavage site. Like β-cleavage, α-cleavage generates a sAPP fragment (sAPPα) that is secreted from the cell and an αCTF (of 84 residues and ∼8 kDa) that remains membrane-associated. α-Cleavage occurs within the Aβ peptide sequence and as such prevents the generation of Aβ from a given APP molecule. Aβ is generated from the βCTF by an intramembrane cleavage (γ-cleavage) that occurs primarily at 40 residues, and to a lesser extent 42 residues, downstream from the β-cleavage site, releasing Aβ1–40 or Aβ1–42. Much progress has been made recently in identifying the major proteases/protease complexes responsible for α-, β-, and γ-cleavage (the α-, β-, and γ-secretases). α-Cleavage appears to be due to the activity of two metalloproteases (TACE and ADAM10) and is thought to occur primarily at the cell surface (2Buxbaum J.D.

The calpain system consists of two Ca2+-activated, cytosolic, neutral pH, cysteine proteases, which are typically distinguished by their different affinities for Ca2+ in vitro (m-calpain and μ-calpain), as well as an endogenous inhibitor, calpastatin (23Sorimachi H.

These changes in the calpain system are most often thought to impact tau metabolism, due in part to their known roles in tau turnover (33Shea T.B. Spencer M.J. Beermann M.L. Cressman C.M. Nixon R.A.

Calpain activity may also modulate Aβ production. Inhibiting calpain activity increases Aβ production by cells in culture, with Aβ42 increasing more than Aβ40 (36Yamazaki T. Haass C. Saido T.C.

To this end, we have examined the metabolism and intracellular distribution of APP in cells following treatment with calpain inhibitors. Our results confirm that calpain inhibitors greatly increase Aβ42 generation, while having a smaller effect on Aβ40. We found that inhibiting calpains resulted in a substantial and proportionate increase in the generation of both α- and β-cleaved CTFs and that this increase in the production of CTFs is likely to be the result of a partial redistribution of APP from the TGN to the plasma membrane. Using a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the βCTF, we show that βCTFs colocalize with a marker of the early endosome, both without treatment and following calpain inhibitor treatment. These data suggest a model in which inhibiting the calpain system drives a greater proportion of APP to the cell surface and early endosomes, where α-cleavage and β-cleavage, respectively, can then occur. The additional βCTFs generated are then substrate for γ-42-secretase activity, further linking the generation of this highly pathogenic species of Aβ to the early endosome.

Growth medium was then replaced with 0.8 ml of fresh medium containing calpeptin or calpain inhibitor III (Calbiochem) and, for transfected L cells, butyrate. After 6 h, this conditioned medium was collected and HEPES (pH 7.4) was added to 25 mm and loaded undiluted into duplicate wells for ELISA. Human and murine Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptide standards were purchased from American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA); stock solutions were stored at −70 °C and further diluted immediately prior to use. ELISA plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with samples and standards. Aβ was detected by incubating for 4 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated JRF/Aβtot/17 (human Aβ) or JRF/rAβ1–15/2 (murine Aβ) diluted in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0.

Calmodulin binding also activates the reductase domain of the enzyme, increasing the rate of reduction of external electron acceptors such as cytochrome c. Several unusual structural features appear to control this activation mechanism, including an autoinhibitory loop, a C-terminal extension, and kinase-dependent phosphorylation sites. Pre-steady state reduction and oxidation time courses for the nNOS reductase domain indicate that CaM binding triggers NADP+ release, which may exert control over steady-state turnover. In addition, the second order rate constant for cytochrome c reduction in the absence of CaM was found to be highly dependent on the presence of NADPH. It appears that NADPH induces a conformational change in the nNOS reductase domain, restricting access to the FMN by external electron acceptors. CaM binding reverses this effect, causing a 30-fold increase in the second order rate constant. The results show a startling interplay between the two ligands, which both exert control over the conformation of the domain to influence its electron transfer properties. In the full-length enzyme, NADPH binding will probably close the conformational lock in vivo, preventing electron transfer to the oxygenase domain and the resultant stimulation of nitric oxide synthesis.

The two domains are linked by a functional peptide of 20–25 amino acids which binds calmodulin (CaM) reversibly at elevated Ca2+ concentrations in the nNOS and endothelial NOS (eNOS) isoforms but irreversibly in the inducible isoform (iNOS). CaM binding activates nNOS and eNOS, providing them with a rapid response mechanism during their participation in signaling cascades. The inducible isoform, on the other hand, is regulated at the transcriptional level. CaM binding has been shown to control NO synthesis by activating electron transfer through the enzyme (16Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All influence the CaM-dependent activation mechanism by either altering the CaM binding affinity or by affecting enzyme activity directly. Mutation of these control elements (e.g. by deletion) activates the reductase domains of eNOS and nNOS in the absence of CaM (Table I) and in some cases triggers NO synthesis (25Daff S. Sagami I.

The reduction potentials of the FAD and FMN cofactors of the nNOSrd are unperturbed by CaM binding (37Noble M.A. Munro A.W. Rivers S.L. Robledo L. Daff S.N. Yellowlees L.J. Shimizu T. Sagami I.

In this paper, we probe the effect of CaM binding on the isolated nNOSrd by following reduction by NADPH and oxidation by cytochrome c under pre-steady-state conditions. The results indicate that the CaM-free enzyme forms a conformationally locked complex with NADPH, which has poor electron transfer capabilities. The importance of the NADPH and NADP+dissociation rates to the CaM-dependent activation mechanism is discussed.Table ISteady-state cytochrome c reduction rates for wild type and mutants of rat nNOSCytochrome c reductase activity1-aMeasured under similar (although not identical) conditions.Ref.+CaM−CaMs−1Wild type nNOS596.025Daff S.

Open table in a new tab Recombinant nNOSrd was expressed in Escherichia coli strain JM109 (DE3) using plasmid pCRNNR as described previously (19Newton D.C. Montgomery H.J. Guillemette J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This plasmid coexpresses the rat nNOSrd residues 695–1429 (including the CaM binding site) and synthetic bovine brain calmodulin. The enzyme was purified essentially as described previously, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol (buffer A) plus 2 mm CaCl2 on 2′,5′-ADP-agarose (Sigma). Bound CaM was removed by washing with buffer A containing 10 mmEGTA. The enzyme was eluted in buffer A plus 10 mmNADP+ and 2 mm CaCl2. The nNOSrd fractions were purified further on CaM-agarose (Sigma) and eluted in buffer A plus 10 mm EGTA. The enzyme was exchanged into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. Enzyme concentrations were calculated from the absorbance at 457 nm of nNOSrd fully oxidized by potassium ferricyanide, using an extinction coefficient of 22,900 m−1 cm−1(38Matsuda H. Iyanagi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity and CaM sensitivity were checked using the cytochrome c turnover assay (without FAD, FMN, superoxide dismutase, and catalase) described by Gachhui et al. (18Gachhui R. Presta A.

Absorbance and kinetic measurements were made on a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. The CaM-rich 2′,5′-ADP-agarose wash fraction was made 10 mm with CaCl2 and then loaded onto a 200-ml phenyl-Sepharose column and washed with 800 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2(buffer B), 1 liter of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 liter of buffer B. The CaM was eluted from the column in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. CaM-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and pooled before being dialyzed in buffer B to remove EDTA. The CaM was freeze dried and stored at −80 °C. Analysis by the Bio-Rad protein assay showed that the freeze-dried residue was 70% protein by weight, whereas SDS-PAGE indicated that the protein was >90% CaM. CaM prepared in this manner was indistinguishable from the CaM supplied by Sigma when used in the CaM activation assay described above. Stopped-flow experiments were performed on an SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics) at a temperature of 25 ± 1 °C contained within an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology) to prevent the reaction of reduced nNOSrd with molecular oxygen. Oxygen levels were maintained below 5 ppm in a nitrogen atmosphere at all times. Data were analyzed using Origin 6.1 (Microcal). Averaged traces from four or more measurements were used for analysis. For all stopped-flow experiments, the buffer was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 when CaM was present, unless otherwise stated. Buffer was made anaerobic by bubbling with nitrogen for 2 h before being left to equilibrate in the anaerobic box overnight. NADPH, NADP+, NADH, NAD+, 2′,5′-ADP, cytochrome c (horse heart, type I; Sigma), and dithionite were brought into the anaerobic box in powder form and dissolved in anaerobic buffer. Concentrations were determined by absorption spectroscopy on a Cary 50 Biospectrophotometer within the anaerobic box using the extinction coefficients 29,500m−1 cm−1 at 550 nm (dithionite-reduced sample), 6,200 m−1cm−1 at 340 nm, 18,000 m−1cm−1 at 260 nm, 6,220 m−1cm−1 at 340 nm, 18,000 m−1cm−1at 260 nm, and 15,400 m−1cm−1 at 260 nm. Reduced nNOSrd was generated by titration with a concentrated solution of NADPH or dithionite until no further spectral change occurred. To produce one-electron-reduced enzyme, nNOSrd was incubated in the anaerobic box in a 1 mmsolution of dithiothreitol overnight. Enzyme (reduced or oxidized) was made anaerobic and free of excess reductant by passage down a 1.5 × 20-ml Sephadex G-25 (Sigma) size separation column immediately prior to use. CaM was brought into the box in a 3 mm solution containing 30 mm CaCl2 and added to the nNOSrd to achieve a 2:1 concentration ratio of CaM to nNOSrd. Concentrations of components of stopped-flow reaction mixtures are given as final concentrations after mixing. 2 μm cytochrome c was mixed with nNOSrd (NADPH- or dithionite-reduced) at concentrations of 5–40 μm with and without bound CaM and with and without a 10-fold excess of NADPH (incubated with the enzyme 10 min prior to use). Cytochrome c reduction was monitored at 550 nm, and pseudo-first order rate constants were calculated by fitting the resultant traces to single exponential functions. Second order rate constants were determined by plotting the pseudo-first order rate constants against enzyme concentration and performing linear regression analysis constrained to pass through the origin. Inhibition of cytochrome c reduction by substrates and substrate analogs was studied by mixing 2 μm cytochrome c with 10 μm dithionite-reduced nNOSrd, plus or minus bound CaM, in the presence of 5–1,000 μm NADPH, NADP+, NADH, NAD+, or 2′,5′ ADP. Rate constants for the reduction of cytochrome c were calculated from the change in absorbance at 550 nm as described above. Oxidation of the nNOSrd flavins by an excess of cytochrome c was conducted by mixing 2 μm enzyme (with and without bound CaM and reduced by either NADPH or dithionite) with 10–130 μmcytochrome c. Cytochrome c reduction was monitored at 550 nm. At low concentrations of cytochrome coxidation was slow, allowing the entire reaction course to be observed. These traces were used to calculate the number of electron equivalents removed from the nNOSrd sample, based on Δε550 = 22,640 for cytochrome c reduction. Faster reactions using higher cytochrome c concentrations, in which much of the absorbance change occurred in the stopped-flow dead time, were rescaled accordingly. Reduction of the flavins of nNOSrd by NADPH was achieved by mixing 5 μm one-electron-reduced enzyme (prepared with bound CaM; with and without 5 mmEGTA) with 200 μm NADPH. The change in absorbance at 458 nm was followed and the resultant traces fitted to double or triple exponential functions. To study the rate of electron transfer from NADPH through to cytochrome c, 10 μm one-electron-reduced nNOSrd (prepared with bound CaM) with 200 μm cytochrome c, with and without 5 mm EGTA, was mixed with 2 μm NADPH. The change in absorbance was monitored at 550 nm. The traces were fitted to a two-step consecutive reaction model in which both phases were fixed to have the same absorbance change. Electron transfer from nNOS or nNOSrd to cytochrome c occurs from the FMN hydroquinone (two-electron-reduced FMN) and is essentially unidirectional (25Daff S. Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30589-30595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 39Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

A kinetic barrier prevents oxidation of the blue FMN semiquinone by cytochrome c despite the reaction being thermodynamically favorable (29Roman L.J. Martásek P. Miller R.T.

Therefore, during catalytic turnover with NADPH and cytochrome c, the FMN alternates between the hydroquinone and semiquinone redox states, receiving electrons from FAD and passing them to cytochrome c, as in SchemeFS1. The rate of reduction of cytochrome c by an excess of reduced nNOSrd is dependent only on the rate of formation of the binary complex (and its dissociation constant) and the rate of the actual electron transfer from the FMN hydroquinone. Pseudo-first order rate constants for cytochrome c reduction were measured by mixing NADPH- or dithionite-reduced enzyme with a substoichiometric concentration of cytochrome c in a stopped-flow spectrophotometer. The rate constants, derived from fitting to single exponential functions, were linearly dependent on enzyme concentration (Fig.1). Second order rate constants for cytochrome c reduction were calculated in the presence and absence of NADPH and bound CaM by linear regression analysis (TableII). The rate constants are greatest for CaM-bound nNOSrd, indicating that the FMN is most accessible for reaction with cytochrome c in the CaM-bound enzyme. These values are independent of whether the enzyme was reduced initially by sodium dithionite (which was removed) or by NADPH (present in 10-fold excess). In the absence of CaM the second order rate constant for dithionite-reduced nNOSrd more than halves, suggesting that the FMN is less accessible. However, in the presence of NADPH this decrease is much more dramatic, more than 30-fold, indicating a large change in FMN accessibility. A similar effect was seen when the enzyme was initially reduced by dithionite, with the NADPH being added subsequently, which rules out the possibility that a combination of partial reduction and a flavin redox potential shift might be responsible. It appears, therefore, that NADPH binding strongly inhibits cytochrome creduction by CaM-free nNOSrd, whereas no inhibition occurs for the CaM-bound enzyme, even at much higher NADPH concentrations.Figure 1Determination of second order rate constants for pre-steady-state cytochrome c reduction by excess nNOSrd.

Open table in a new tab In Fig.2 the concentrations of NADPH and NADP+ are plotted against the pseudo-first order rate constant for cytochrome c reduction by 10 μmCaM-free nNOSrd (prereduced by dithionite). Data were fitted to single binding site noncompetitive inhibition models to determine values for percentage inhibition and KI (inhibition constants). These data, and parameters for NAD+, NADH, and 2′,5′-ADP, are shown in Table III. NADPH inhibited the reaction to the greatest extent (87%) and had a lowKI (2.7 μm), indicating tight binding. NADP+ inhibited the reaction in two phases, the first resulting in 46% inhibition caused by tight binding (2 μm), the second requiring much more NADP+ and possibly resulting from partial oxidation of the flavins by excess NADP+. This effect complicates the data, adding a degree of uncertainty to the values. NAD+ had a similar effect. NADH inhibited cytochrome c reduction much less than NADPH, and 2′,5′-ADP had no significant effect, consequently, no accurateKI values could be obtained for these. It appears, therefore, that the inhibition effect relies on the nicotinamide substituent and occurs whether this is reduced or oxidized. Surprisingly, the physiological substrate of the enzyme, NADPH, appears to be its most potent inhibitor. No inhibition effect was observed with CaM-bound nNOSrd with any of the ligands.Table IIINoncompetitive inhibition constants Ki for the action of substrate and substrate analog inhibitors on the pre-steady-state rate constants for reduction of 1 μm cytochrome c by 5 μm dithionite-reduced nNOSrd in the absence of CaM (Fig.2)Inhibitor% InhibitionKiμmNADPH872.6 ± 1.0NADP+43<2NADH17NAD+55<2ADP0Fitting was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Fitting was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The rates of cytochrome c reduction determined above are linearly dependent on the concentration of nNOSrd, suggesting that the actual rate of FMN to cytochrome c electron transfer is very rapid. In the case of CaM-bound nNOSrd, rates are measured above 600 s−1 and must occur beyond the resolution of the stopped-flow instrument. Mixing 10 μm reduced nNOSrd with 130 μm excess cytochrome c will therefore lead to rapid, successive electron transfers until the nNOSrd has been oxidized completely to its stable one-electron-reduced form. For example, the bimolecular reaction of 130 μm cytochromec with nNOSrd (the first electron transfer) will occur at 4,700 s−1, based on the second order rate constant determined above. The rates of subsequent electron transfer events will depend on the rate at which reduced cytochrome c dissociates and the rate at which the second electron arrives at the FMN. This series of reactions represents part of the catalytic cycle for cytochrome c reduction as illustrated in Scheme FS1. In the scheme, Steps 1–5 represent the nNOSrd catalytic cycle in terms of individual electron transfer events. The flavin oxidation experiment begins with Step 1a (the first electron transfer to cytochromec) and ends with Step 5. As can be seen, a total of three electron equivalents are transferred from nNOSrd to cytochromec. Fig. 3 shows stopped-flow time courses for complete nNOSrd oxidation by excess cytochromec using CaM-bound and CaM-free enzyme reduced by either sodium dithionite or NADPH. In Fig. 3 the absorbance change observed at 550 nm caused by cytochrome c reduction has been converted to molar reducing equivalents by determining the s"

The Arabidopsis MCM3 homologue forms part of the mini chromosome maintenance (MCM) complex involved in the initiation of DNA replication at the transition G1/S. Consistent with its role at the G1/S transition we show that the AtMCM3 gene is transcriptionally regulated at S phase. The 5′ region of this gene contains several E2F consensus binding sites, two of which match the human consensus closely and whose roles have been studied here. The identity of the two sequences as E2F binding sites has been confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay analyses. Furthermore the promoter is activated by AtE2F-a and AtDP-a factors in transient expression studies. One of the E2F binding sites is shown to be responsible for the G2-specific repression of the promoter in synchronized cell suspension cultures. In contrast, the second E2F binding site has a role in meristem-specific expression in planta as deletion of this site eliminates the expression of a reporter gene in root and apical meristems.

The control of cell proliferation in these areas is regulated by both environmental signals and plant growth regulators and is key for plant development making cell cycle control and plant development inextricably linked. Cell cycle progression is primarily regulated at the G1/S transition, prior to DNA replication in S phase, and requires the E2F-initiated activation of a number of genes (reviewed in Ref. 1Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) notably those involved in cell cycle control, initiation of DNA replication, and DNA synthesis. A group of genes that have an important role in the initiation of replication and are suggested to be under the transcriptional control of E2F factors are the mini chromosome maintenance (MCM)1 proteins (2Ohtani K. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D793-D804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The successful passage through the G1/S transition into S phase requires that replication is initiated following the formation and activation of prereplicative complexes. The formation of these complexes is initiated by the binding of cdc6 to origin recognition complexes during G1 allowing the recruitment of the MCM complex of proteins. The MCM complex consists of six related proteins (MCM2–7) that have been shown in yeast to have an important role in replication (3Kearsey S.E. Labib K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 4Tye B.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), conditional mutants being defective in initiation at the non-permissive temperature. The recruitment of the MCMs completes the formation of the complex of prereplication, and S phase is triggered by the activation of this complex by cyclin-dependent kinases leading to the switch from the complex of prereplication to a complex of postreplication. Plants have been shown to have E2F homologues (5Grafi G. Burnett R.J. Helentjaris T. Larkins B.A. DeCaprio J.A. Sellers W.R. Kaelin W.G., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The AtE2Fs of the first group (E2F-a to c) are functional transcription factors that can specifically recognize an E2F consensus sequence in association with AtDP proteins and can transactivate an E2F-responsive reporter gene in plant cells. The second group of AtE2Fs (E2F-d to f) retain the DNA binding domain but lack any other conserved region, do not require AtDP for DNA binding, and do not act as functional activators of transcription (9Mariconti L. Pellegrini B. Cantoni R. Stevens R. Bergounioux C. Cella R. Albani D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9911-9919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. J.

The two distinct groups of E2Fs may therefore have complementary roles in the activation of proliferation, and the second group in particular could be involved in the switch from active division to differentiation. The conservation of the E2F pathway in plants and animals, which does not exists in unicellular organisms such as yeast, may indicate that, as well as its role in cell cycle regulation, it also has a role in the development of multicellular organisms (reviewed in Ref. 11Muller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). However, although the factors that associate with E2Fs to regulate their cell cycle activity are known, in plants especially, the mechanisms involved in the switch to differentiation are less well studied. Arabidopsis E2F factors of the first group have been shown to activate reporter genes in transient expression assays via a consensus E2F binding site repeated six times (7Albani D. Mariconti L.

Jasinski S. Cella R. Tremousaygue D. Bergounioux C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 266: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The ability of the E2F-a and AtDP-a factors to induce S phase in differentiated, non-dividing leaf cells has also recently been shown in planta (8Rossignol P. Stevens R. Perennes C. Jasinski S. Cella R. Tremousaygue D. Bergounioux C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 266: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). E2F factors thus play an essential role in the activation of S phase and the progression through the cell cycle and therefore may have a role that is linked with the growth and development of a plant via their activity on specific cell cycle gene promoters. The involvement of E2F binding sites in the promoters of genes involved in the transition from G1 to S phase has been studied in several cases in plants. The cdc6 promoter contains an E2F consensus site to which E2F factors have been shown to bind (12de Jager S.M. Menges M. Bauer U.M. Murra J.A. Plant. Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 555-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The promoter of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR2) promoter involved in deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis for DNA replication contains two E2F consensus sites involved in up-regulation of the promoter at the G1/S transition with one of the elements behaving like a repressor outside S phase (13Chabouteá M.E. Clement B. Sekine M. Philipps G. Chaubet-Gigot N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1987-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The expression of the rice PCNA gene is restricted to meristematic regions, and two promoter elements have been found to be essential for this activity (14Kosugi S. Suzuka I. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 1995; 7: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); furthermore E2F consensus sequences in the rice and tobacco PCNA promoters are involved in the activation of a reporter gene in both cultured cells and in whole plants (15Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Plant J. 2002; 29: 45-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this report we have analyzed the activation of the promoter of theArabidopsis MCM3 gene by E2F transcription factors. The wild type promoter is transcriptionally regulated at S phase, and deletion of the first E2F binding site (D1) leads to loss of the S phase regulation of the promoter by a loss of repression during G2 in synchronized cell suspensions. ArabidopsisE2F factors both bind and activate the wild type promoter in transient expression analyses. Furthermore, interestingly, deletion of the second site (D2) eliminates the expression in meristematic regions in planta, and this site with a TATA box is sufficient to induce reporter gene expression in plant meristems. The Arabidopsis cell suspension culture derived from Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia was grown at 21 °C in 16 h of light and subcultured every 7 days in Gamborg B5 media (Sigma) supplemented with 0.2 mg/liter α-naphthaleneacetic acid. Tobacco BY2 cell suspension cultures were grown according to a previously described method (16Nagata T. Nemoto Y. Hasezawa S. Int. Rev. Cyto. 1992; 132: 1-30Crossref Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Plants ofA. thaliana ecotype Columbia were grown under short day conditions (9 h of light) at 19 °C (day) and 17 °C (night). The MCM3 promoter fragment was amplified by PCR following standard procedures using a 5′ oligo of sequence: 5′-CATTCCCCGTTTCTTACGGTTGCTGAG-3′ and a 3′ oligo of sequence 5′-CTGGGTTCTTCGTAAGAACTTTTCTTCTTC-3′ (Fig. 1) from A. thaliana DNA. The fragment was cloned into pGEM-T, checked by sequencing, and subsequently subcloned into the vector pTAK upstream of the uidA reporter gene to create pMCM3-uidA. For stable expression, in either Arabidopsis plants or tobacco BY2 strains, a HindIII-EcoRI fragment of the cassette containing the MCM3 promoter, uidA gene, and terminator was inserted into the binary vector pPZP111. The site D2 was cloned into pUC18 by annealing forward and reverse oligos of sequence 5′-GCCTTGAGGAAATCAAACGCGCCAAACAAGCGCGTAGACG-3′ (site D2 in bold). An EcoRI-SalI fragment containing the site D2 was then cloned into the vector pLP140 upstream of the minimal promoter fused to the uidA reporter gene to create D2-uidA. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene) on the pMCM3-uidA construct in pTAK to create the following mutants: pMCM3d1-uidA, primer: 5′-GCCTTGAGGAAATCAAACCAAGCGCGTAGACG-3′ and exact complement; pMCM3d2-uidA, primer: 5′-GGCCCAAAATGACCCAAGGGTACAGGTTATC-3′ and exact complement; pMCM3d1-d2-uidA, the double mutant was created using the oligos for pMCM3d2-uidA on the pMCM3d1-uidA clone. All clones were checked by sequencing for the presence of the correct mutations. 35S::AtE2F-a and 35S::AtDP-a for transient expression assays were cloned in the vector pDH51 as previously described (8Rossignol P.

Aphidicolin was removed from the culture by centrifuging, and the pelleted cells were washed twice in the same volume of culture medium. The cells were resuspended in the same volume of fresh medium, and G2-synchronized cells were obtained ∼6 h after the synchronization. To determine the metaphasic rate, 100 μl of cell suspension was added to 1 ml of a 2% (w/v) solution of cold paraformaldehyde (dissolved in phosphate buffer pH 7). The cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (19Planchais S. Glab N. Trehin C. Perennes C. Bureau J.M. Meijer L. Bergounioux C.

To show the specificity of binding, wild type or mutated cold annealed probes were included in the reactions. Wild type and mutated oligos for each site were used as follows. The sense oligo only is shown, the antisense oligo being the exact complement on the other strand: wild type site D1, 5′-GCCTTGAGGAAATCAAACGCGCCAAACAAGCGCGTAGACG-3′; mutated site d1, 5′-GCCTTGAGGAAATCAAACCAAGCGCGTAGACG-3′; wild type site D2, 5′-GGCCCAAAATGACCCTTCCCGCCAAAAAGGGTACAGGTTATC-3′; mutated site d2, 5′-GGCCCAAAATGACCCAAGGGTACAGGTTATC-3′. The protein-DNA complexes were electrophoresed for 3 h at 4 °C on 4% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE. Gels were dried and exposed to film.

Bergounioux, unpublished data. has allowed the transcription start site to be predicted. The 5′-untranslated region, based on the cDNA sequences, extends to thearrow marked in Fig. 1 at −60 bp; upstream of this point there are no obvious TATA, CAAT, or GC boxes, but analysis using Markov Chain Promoter Finder McPromoter V3.0 (23Ohler U. Niemann H. Liao G. Rubin G.M. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17 Suppl. 1: 199-206Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar) predicted that transcription was most likely to start between −165 and −65 bp relative to the ATG, which correlates with the length of the 5′-untranslated region of five of the MCM3cDNAs. Many of the genes regulated at the G1/S transition are transcriptionally controlled by E2F factors, and therefore we analyzed, using the Transplorer software (www.developmentontheedge.com/transplorer.shtml), the 715 bps directly upstream of the ATG of the MCM3 gene for consensus E2F sites. This fragment upstream of the MCM3cDNA (GenBankTM accession no. AJ000058) was cloned by PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”) from data available from the complete sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome (At5g46280). Several binding sites for different transcription factors were found, those presenting the highest homology were (with numbers of putative sites in brackets): MYB.PHY3 [2], E2F [5], AP-1 [3], MADS-B [4], and Sp1 [3] (Fig. 1). Two E2F consensus binding sites matched the human consensus very closely, TTT(C/G) (C/G)CGC, and included the central CG essential for E2F binding (Fig. 1). The first site was at −272 bp from the ATG of sequence CGCGCCAAA, and the second at −99 bp of sequence CCCGCCAAA. To analyze the role of these two E2F sites in the transcriptional regulation of the MCM3 transcripts, the promoter fragment spanning the two sites was cloned upstream of the β-glucuronidase (uidA) reporter gene in the plasmid pTAK (see “Experimental Procedures”). Deletion mutants were created in each consensus site separately (pMCM3d1 or pMCM3d2 or together to form the double mutant (pMCM3d1-d2) to study the effect of the two E2F binding sites on the promoter activity. A BY2 culture was stably transformed with the following constructions: pMCM3-uidA, pMCM3d1-uidA, pMCM3d2-uidA, and pMCM3d1-d2-uidA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Calli were regenerated on selective media and checked for GUS activity. Once established, each transformed culture was synchronized using aphidicolin treatment to block cells in G1/S and released from the block by washing in fresh medium. Samples of cells were taken at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 h after the release from the block, and RNA was prepared for Northern blot analysis of theuidA transcript. The results are shown in Fig.2 for each transformed line and include Histone H4 as the marker for S phase as well as mitotic index data for G2 to show that each synchronization had worked efficiently. The uidA transcripts appear slightly before the rise in Histone H4 levels and are absent when the mitotic index is high (Fig. 2A). Therefore AtMCM3 is transcriptionally regulated at G1/S phase (as our unpublished observations have suggested following analysis of the transcripts levels of this gene). pMCM3d1-uidA transcripts are present at all points during the cell cycle and are no longer down-regulated during G2(Fig. 2B). The culture is shown to be synchronized because of the H4 and mitotic index data. Therefore pMCM3d1 is no longer regulated at S phase compared with the pMCM3-uidA expression and becomes constitutively activated during the cell cycle. In contrast, pMCM3d2-uidA transcripts show S phase transcriptional regulation similar to the wild type promoter, although transcript levels are much lower being transcriptionally up-regulated at G1/S and silenced during G2 (Fig.2C, the blot being exposed to film for twice as long as the other blots). The double mutant pMCM3d1-d2 is no longer cell cycle-regulated having lost the transcriptional down-regulation seen for the wild type promoter during G2 (Fig. 2D). The profile of transcript expression for the double mutant reflects that of the pMCM3d1 mutant, the uidA transcript appearing in all cell cycle phases. Results indicate that in cell suspension cultures the site D1 represses the cell cycle G2 inhibition of pMCM3 activity, whereas site D2 may affect the level of promoter activity in S phase. The identity of the two E2F binding sites was studied by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using available AtE2F factors (selected for ease of purification). E2F factors AtE2F-c, AtE2F-d, and AtDP-b were cloned and purified as previously described (9Mariconti L. Pellegrini B. Cantoni R. Stevens R. Bergounioux C. Cella R. Albani D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9911-9919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and used in EMSA with each of the two wild type putative E2F pMCM3 sites in the form of radioactively labeled probes (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both sites allow the formation of E2F-DP complexes (E2F-c belongs to the first group of AtE2F factors and requires AtDP for DNA binding) as well as allowing binding of the factor AtE2F-d (of the second group of AtE2F factors, which do not require AtDP for DNA binding). To determine that the binding was specific for each site, competition experiments were carried out with either wild type or the mutated fragments. For both sites D1 and D2, cold wild type competitor reduces the quantity of binding to the radioactively labeled probe as the factor is titrated out, whereas addition of excess quantities of cold-mutated probe do not affect the gel shift signal observed (Fig.3). Thus both sites are characterized as binding E2F factors of both groups 1 and 2 in vitro. However, even if EMSA is not quantitative, the signal obtained with D2 is weaker than that obtained with D1 using the same amount of recombinant AtE2Fc. This observation suggests that even in vitro the two sites behave differently.

Genomics. 2002; 266: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), see “Experimental Procedures,” were included in the transient expression assays as shown in Fig.4. The addition of AtDP-a, AtE2F-a alone, or both factors together increases the GUS activity by over 1.5-fold compared with the control without addition of these transactivating factors. The biggest increase is seen on addition of AtE2F-a alone or both AtE2F-a and AtDP-a together. Having shown that the wild type MCM3 promoter can activate a reporter gene, the mutants were analyzed for their effect on the total activity of the promoter. Mutating either E2F binding site reduces the GUS activity in transient expression assays (data not shown). Site 2 (D2), under conditions of transient expression, appears to contribute most to the activity of the promoter as the mutated pMCM3d2 shows a greater decrease in GUS activity than the mutation pMCM3d1. Transient expression assays using the double mutant pMCM3d1-d2 show the lowest GUS activity indicating the necessity of the two E2F sites for the activity of this promoter. Thus both E2F sites contribute to the overall activity of the promoter. The effect of the addition of 35S::E2F-a to the transient expression assays above is shown in Fig.5. Removal of the site D1 may increase the expression of the GUS reporter gene slightly compared with the wild type promoter. This result shows the promoter activation gained from cells in G2 where the promoter activity is no longer repressed and shows therefore that the site D1 may act as an E2F-specific repressor of promoter activity. The reverse is true for the site D2, which is necessary for promoter activity, and its removal reduces reporter gene activity on addition of E2F-a transcription factor. The double mutant also shows reduced activity presumably reflecting the loss of the site D2. The results therefore confirm the observations in Fig. 2. Arabidopsis plants were transformed with the constructs pMCM3-uidA, pMCM3d1-uidA, pMCM3d2-uidA, and pMCM3d1-d2-uidA (see “Experimental Procedures”) to analyze levels of uidAexpression in planta. Approximately 200 T1transformants resistant to kanamycin were obtained. Plantlets from 50 independent transformed lines for each of the four constructions were used for protein extractions and for determination of GUS activity. Compared with untransformed control plantlets with background GUS activity, all the four lines showed increased levels of GUS activity (data not shown). This quantitative measure of total GUS activity in a plant is an average measure of the activity in all plant tissues and does not give any indication of how GUS activity may vary in different cell cycle stages in different plant tissues so in plantastaining was carried out on 50 independent T1 lines (Fig.6). pMCM3-uidA showed that the wild type promoter was active in meristematic regions, in particular in secondary root tips and the meristem regions at the base of leaves. The construction pMCM3d1-uidA also showed similar expression patterns to that of the wild type promoter with higher activity levels in secondary roots and leaf meristems compared with the rest of the plant. However the construction pMCM3d2-uidA gave altereduidA expression patterns, plantlets no longer showed expression in root meristems; these areas appeared white. However, in other areas of the plant GUS activity was observed. Similarly the double mutant pMCM3d1-d2-uidA had also lost meristematic expression in the same way as did the pMCM3d2-uidApresumably due to the absence in these transformants of the site D2. Furthermore, we have shown that the site D2 placed in front of a minimal promoter (TATA box; see “Experimental Procedures”) is sufficient to activate reporter gene expression in plant meristems (Fig. 7, D2-uidA). Therefore the site D2, out of the context of the MCM3 promoter, is responsible for the specificity of meristematic expression via factors that bind this site. We conclude that D1 has little role in the regulation of MCM3 in meristems, in contrast D2 is essential for regulation of pMCM3 in plant meristematic regions. The promoter of the AtMCM3 homologue, a gene implicated in the initiation of replication and the transition G1/S, contains several E2F consensus binding sites, two of which match the human consensus closely: TTT(C/G)(C/G)CGC (24Slansky J.E. Farnham P.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 208: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which the transcription rate of the MCM3 gene is controlled will aid our understanding of the processes involved in DNA replication. The identity of the two sequences as E2F binding sites has been confirmed by EMSA analyses: Arabidopsis E2F transcription factors of both group 1 (transcriptional activators requiring DP for DNA binding) and group 2 (transcriptional repressors that do not require DP) (9Mariconti L. Pellegrini B. Cantoni R. Stevens R. Bergounioux C. Cella R. Albani D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9911-9919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16553-16558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) bind both sites D1 and D2. This is consistent with previous results showing that a consensus E2F site will bind all AtE2F factors in vitro (9Mariconti L. Pellegrini B. Cantoni R. Stevens R. Bergounioux C. Cella R. Albani D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9911-9919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Even though in this study we have not used every factor in our experiments, we would expect to see thatin vitro all AtE2F factors are capable of binding the two sites as both fit the consensus E2F sequence well. However, thesein vitro assays do not enable us to determine the activating or repressing roles that these different factors may have in planta in the context of the whole promoter or whether different E2Fs compete for the two sites in different ways (25Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Further characterization of the promoter in vivo shows that its activity is cell cycle-regulated at G1/S. The promoter pMCM3 is also activated by AtE2F-a and AtDP-a transcription factors in transient expression studies. The transient expression analyses in Fig.5 together with the Northern blot analyses would indicate that D1 is responsible for the G2-specific repression of the promoter seen in a cell suspension culture and that D2 is required for the level of S phase activity. We have previously shown that addition of E2F factors to a cell population increases the proportion of S phase (8Rossignol P. Stevens R. Perennes C. Jasinski S. Cella R. Tremousaygue D. Bergounioux C. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 266: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); other transcription factors expressed during S phase may therefore be responsible for activation of S phase-specific promoters such as pMCM3. However, it has been shown here that mutating E2F sites within the promoter alters the promoter activity, and we can therefore conclude that the MCM3 promoter is specifically activated by E2Fs. It has already been shown that the tobacco RNR2 promoter has two E2F binding sites matching the consensus perfectly but each has a different function in terms of cell cycle regulation (13Chabouteá M.E. Clement B. Sekine M. Philipps G. Chaubet-Gigot N. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1987-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). One site acts as an S phase activator while the other acts as a repressor outside S phasein vitro. Furthermore, a variant E2F site in the promoters of the cdc2, cyclin A, and cdc25 genes contributes to the cell cycle-dependent timing of transcription of these genes; mutation of this site and the overlapping CDF-1 binding site removes the transcriptional repression in G1 (26Zwicker J. Muller R. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 3-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) illustrating that adjacent sequences may interact with E2F binding sites. In the human Ran-binding protein 1 promoter, two E2F sites act as activating or repressing elements depending on the neighboring Sp1 element (27Di Fiore B. Guarguaglini G. Palena A. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Lavia P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10339-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The most interesting results from this study concern the role of the two sites in different cellular environments: a cell suspension culture and during plant development. Two highly similar E2F binding sites in the promoter of the MCM3 gene are responsible for different cell cycle regulation or developmental expression patterns depending on the cellular environment. At the whole plant level, the mutation of the site D1 has no effect on expression in plant meristems. However, the site D2 has a role in the meristem-specific expression of the MCM3 promoter. Deletion of this site clearly removes expression from root meristems and the apical meristem while maintaining the level of GUS activity elsewhere in the plant. Furthermore this site, with only a minimal promoter, is sufficient for activation of a reporter gene in plant meristems (and could be a useful tool for meristem-targeted expression). This site could therefore play several roles in the plant. First, it could bind specific E2Fs and E2F-associated factors, which within the meristems activate expression. Alternatively, the existence of E2Fs or associated factors that bind to the site D2 and act as repressors in non-meristematic regions could be envisaged. Other results in planta have shown that an E2F site in the PCNA promoter is responsible for the repression of transcriptional activity of this gene in mature leaves (28Egelkrout E.M. Robertson D. Hanley-Bowdoin L. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1437-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Also, mutation of a single E2F site in the RNR1b 5′-untranslated region is sufficient to eliminate all reporter gene expression from tobacco plantlets (29Chabouteá M.E. Clement B. Philipps G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17845-17851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is clear that differences exist between meristematic (dividing) and other (differentiated) tissues that are linked to a complex of proteins including E2Fs involved in transcriptional activation. In our study, results from meristematic expression show that additional levels of regulation exist for the site D2 in meristems compared with cell suspension cultures. Mutation of the site D2 completely eliminates reporter gene expression in meristems, in all transgenic lines analyzed, and not other parts of the plant, whereas in cell suspension cultures a low level of activity is maintained in S phase. This suggests that cell suspension cultures cannot be used as a model for plant meristematic regions. It is possible that the two E2F groups or the two AtDPs have different roles in planta and are expressed in different tissues to enable the form of regulation seen for the site D2 to occur. Results leading to a similar idea have been shown in certain tissues duringDrosophila oogenesis. DP is used uniquely for cell cycle arrest rather than cell cycle progression and is required for the successful development of the dorso-ventral axis (30Myster D.L. Bonnette P.C. Duronio R.J. Development. 2000; 127: 3249-3261PubMed Google Scholar). Other non-identified factors involved in differentiation could be responsible for the meristem-specific expression in complex with E2F proteins. In our case the factor involved may be an Sp1-like transcription factor (as yet unidentified in Arabidopsis) because the site D2 overlaps a putative Sp1 binding site (human consensus sequence, Fig.1). Sp1 factors have been shown to interact with E2F, an interaction that is essential for the regulation of certain promoters (31Rotheneder H. Geymayer S. Haidweger E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 1005-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 32Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown the role of two E2F sites in control of the cell cycle and also the role of one site in meristematic cells in planta. It is interesting to note in our study that two E2F binding sites can have very different roles depending on the context of transcriptional regulation (reviewed in Ref. 33Fry C.J. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29583-29586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This phenomenon can occur by several mechanisms involving action at a distance, overlapping binding sites, protein-protein interactions, and the cellular environment. Thus the role or activity of a site is influenced by the surrounding promoter structure and the cellular environment or tissue type. Factors such as Sp1, as mentioned above, can function as basal promoter elements or upstream activators by bending the DNA through protein-protein interactions and thus can function at a distance. Thus the context of the two sites in the MCM3 promoter depends on the cellular environment as we have shown plus as yet unknown protein-protein interactions that must now be identified and may be responsible for their different roles. We thank Alexander Kel for help analyzing the promoter MCM3 with the Transplorer software and Jean-Paul Barres for taking excellent care of our plants."

Cells were incubated in media containing varying concentrations of zinc (1.5, 5, 15, and 50 μm). Within 3 h, the intracellular zinc content was lower in cells exposed to 1.5 and 5 μm, compared with the other groups. Low intracellular zinc concentrations were associated with the activation of NF-κB, based on high levels of IκBα phosphorylation, low IκBα concentrations, and high NF-κB binding activity in total cell fractions. However, the active dimer accumulated in the cytosol, as shown by a low ratio of nuclear/cytosolic NF-κB binding activity. This altered nuclear translocation was accompanied by a decreased transactivation of an endogenous NF-κB-driven gene (ikba) and of a reporter gene (pNF-κB-luc). In cells with low intracellular zinc concentrations, a low rate of in vitro tubulin polymerization was measured compared with the other groups. We conclude that low intracellular zinc concentrations induce tubulin depolymerization, which may be one signal for NF-κB activation. However, NF-κB nuclear translocation is impaired, which inhibits the transactivation of NF-κB-driven genes. This could affect cell survival, and be an important factor in certain zinc deficiency-associated pathologies.

Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). However, the developing brain can be highly sensitive to a deficit of this nutrient for several reasons, including the need of zinc for appropriate cell differentiation, migration, and growth. Consistent with this, developmental zinc deficiency is characterized by a high frequency of brain and eye malformations, including agenesis and dysmorphogenesis of the brain, spinal cord, eye, and olfactory tract (2Rogers J.M. Oteiza P.I. Keen C.L. Gelder N.M. Butterworth R.F. Drujan B.D. (Mal)Nutrition and the Infant Brain. Wiley-Liss, New York1990: 225-236Google Scholar, 3Keen C.L. Taubeneck M.W. Daston G.P. Gershwin M.E. Ansari A. Rogers J. Dev. Brain Dysfunct. 1995; 8: 79-89Google Scholar). In addition to gross structural malformations, zinc deprivation during critical developmental periods can result in altered emotionality and food motivation early in life (4Golub M.S. Keen C.L. Gershwin M.E. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 354S-357SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although numerous structural defects have been reported to occur as a consequence of embryonic and fetal zinc deficiency (5Rogers J.M. Taubeneck M.W. Daston G.P. Sulik K.K. Zucker R.M. Elstein K.H. Jankowski M.A. Keen C.L. Teratology. 1995; 52: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the mechanisms underlying these defects are poorly understood. However, it has been reported that gestational zinc deficiency for a period of time as short as 4 days can result in excessive cell death in the conceptus, particularly in the neural crest cell region (5Rogers J.M. Taubeneck M.W. Daston G.P. Sulik K.K. Zucker R.M. Elstein K.H. Jankowski M.A. Keen C.L. Teratology. 1995; 52: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Based on histological evidence, the excessive cell death may be through programmed cell death (apoptosis). Rel/NF-κB1 transcription factors are activated by multiple signals, and regulate the expression of numerous genes. Work to date suggests that this transcription factor is involved in the regulation of the immune and stress response, in cell cycle progression, in the decision of cells to undergo apoptosis and in the maintenance of cell structure and the nearby environment (6Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar). Known members of Rel/NF-κB family of proteins include c-Rel, RelB, RelA (p65), p50, and p52. The activity of the Rel/NF-κB homo- and heterodimers is regulated by their interaction with inhibitory IκB proteins, which anchor the transcription factor to the cytosol (7Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1689) Google Scholar). One of the best described interactions is that of IκBα, which prevents the translocation of NF-κB to the nuclei and its binding to DNA. In general, activation is mediated by the phosphorylation of two conserved serines (Ser-32 and Ser-36 in human IκBα) in IκB by specific IκB kinases, which targets IκBα for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome (8Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). We previously reported that there is a reduction in NF-κB binding activity in nuclear extracts of 3T3 cells after they are incubated in media containing low concentrations of zinc (0.5 and 5 μm) for 24 h (9Oteiza P.I. Clegg M.S. Zago M.P. Keen C.L. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Similarly, a low NF-κB binding activity was observed in nuclear extracts obtained from testes of developing male rats fed low zinc diets for 1 week (10Oteiza P.I. Clegg M.S. Keen C.L. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results suggest that zinc can modulate NF-κB activation; however, the mechanism(s) underlying this effect of a deficit of zinc are unclear. Alterations in the cytoskeletal network could affect the translocation of transcription factors, such as NF-κB, that reside in the cytosol in an inactive form, which, after activation, require the translocation of the active form to the nuclei (11Rosette C. Karin M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Our previous findings of impaired tubulin polymerization in brains obtained from zinc-deficient animals (12Oteiza P.I. Hurley L.S. Lonnerdal B. Keen C.L. J. Nutr. 1988; 118: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 13Oteiza P.I. Cuellar S. Lonnerdal B. Hurley L.S. Keen C.L. Teratology. 1990; 41: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Oteiza P.I. Hurley L.S. Lonnerdal B. Keen C.L. Biol. Trace Elem. Res. 1990; 24: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) led us to postulate that low intracellular zinc could result in a defect in the transportation of NF-κB from the cytosol to the nucleus. A series of papers have demonstrated, in certain cell types, that the activation of NF-κB can protect cells from apoptosis, suggesting a role for NF-κB in cell survival (15Sonenshein G.E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 16Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 17Chen F. Castranova V. Shi X. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned that the brain teratogenicity associated with gestational zinc deficiency could be caused, in part, by increased cell death by apoptosis secondary to an impairment in NF-κB activation. To begin to study the possible mechanisms underlying the modulation of NF-κB by zinc, we exposed human neuroblastoma IMR-32 cells to media containing different concentrations of zinc (1.5–50 μm). In the current work, we characterized the effect of these media on the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in these cells, as well as on several different steps in NF-κB activation, including the transactivating capacity of endogenous NF-κB-driven gene (ikba) (18de Martin R.

Data obtained from this study suggest that low intracellular zinc concentrations impair tubulin assembly, which may be one signal for NF-κB activation. We suggest that zinc tubulin disassembly contributes to the altered NF-κB nuclear translocation and a subsequent inhibition of NF-κB-dependent gene transactivation. IMR-32 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MA). Cell culture media and reagents and LipofectAMINETM 2000 were obtained from Invitrogen. The oligonucleotides containing the consensus sequences for NF-κB (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) and OCT-1, the reagents for the EMSA assay, the enzyme assay systems for the determination of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities, and the pSV-β-galactosidase control vector were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The PathDetect NF-κB cis reporting system was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The cDNA for IκBα was a gift from Dr. E. Arzt (University of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina). Antibodies for RelA, p50, p52, IκBα, and β tubulin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); antibody for phospho-IκBα was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).

The ECL Western blotting system was from Amersham Biosciences. The APO-BRDUTM kit was from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Lactacystin was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). All other reagents were the highest quality available and were purchased from Sigma. IMR-32 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Complex medium (55% DMEM high glucose, 30% Ham’s F-12, 5% α-minimal essential medium) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and antibiotic-antimycotic (50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.125 μg/ml amphotericin B). Zinc-deficient FBS was prepared by chelation with diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid as previously described (9Oteiza P.I. Clegg M.S. Zago M.P. Keen C.L. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The chelated FBS was subsequently diluted with complex medium to a final concentration of 3 mg/ml protein to match the protein concentration of the control nondialyzed media (10% FBS). The zinc concentration of the zinc-deficient medium was 1.5 μm, and portions of this medium were supplemented with ZnCl2 to reach concentrations of 5, 15, and 50 μm. Cells were grown in control nondialyzed medium (complex medium containing 10% nonchelated FBS) until 90% confluence, after which the medium was removed and replaced with control medium or chelated media containing 1.5 (1.5 Zn), 5 (5 Zn), 15 (15 Zn), or 50 (50 Zn) μm zinc. Cells were harvested at 3, 6, 12, 24, or 48 h in culture. Cells (1.2 × 106) were incubated in the corresponding media for 3–48 h. At the corresponding time points, the medium was decanted and cells were rinsed with warm DMEM and added with 1 ml of DMEM containing 25 μm TSQ. Cells were dispersed and incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 15 min. Cells were transferred to 1.5-ml conical tubes and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was rinsed twice with PBS and finally resuspended in 0.2 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Igepal. After a brief sonication, the fluorescence at 480 nm (λexc = 365) was measured. To evaluate the DNA content, samples were incubated with 50 μm propidium iodide. After incubating for 20 min at room temperature, the fluorescence (λexc = 538, λem = 590) was measured. Results are expressed as the ratio TSQ fluorescence/propidium iodide fluorescence. After 24 h in the respective media, the medium was discarded and cells (15 × 106) were scrapped and rinsed three times with warm PBS. After centrifuging at 800 × g for 10 min at room temperature, the pellet was frozen at −80 °C and, after thawing, it was resuspended to a final volume of 0.4 ml. After a brief sonication, an aliquot was taken for the determination of protein concentration and the rest of the sample was wet ashed with 16 m nitric acid (Baker’s Instra-analyzed: J.T. Baker, Philipsburg, NJ). Concentrations of zinc, copper, and iron were determined by ICP-AES (Trace Scan; Thermo Elemental, Franklin, MA). Certified reference solutions (QC 21, Spec CentriPrep, Metuchen, NJ) were used to generate standard curves for each element. A sample of a National Bureau of Standards Bovine Liver (SRM 1577; United States Department of Commerce, National Bureau of Standards, Washington, DC) was included with the samples to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were isolated as previously described (21Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At the corresponding time points, the medium was discarded and cells were rinsed with PBS and scraped. After centrifugation at 800 ×g for 10 min, the pellet (20 × 106 cells) was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1% Igepal), incubated for 10 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 1 min at 12,000 × g. The supernatant fraction was removed, and the nuclear pellets were resuspended in 60 μl of buffer B (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF). Samples were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube and diluted in 45 μl of buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar), and samples were stored at −80 °C. For the EMSA, the oligonucleotide containing the consensus sequence and NF-κB was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified using Chroma Spin-10 columns. Samples were incubated with the labeled oligonucleotide (20,000–30,000 cpm) for 20 min at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20% glycerol, 5 mmMgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm DTT, 250 mm NaCl, and 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC). For the supershift assays, prior to the addition of the labeled nucleotide, samples were incubated in the presence of the corresponding antibodies (RelA, p50, or p52). The products were separated by electrophoresis in a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel using 0.5× TBE (45 mmTris borate, 1 mm EDTA) as the running buffer. The gels were dried and the radioactivity quantitated in a PhosphorImager 640 (Amersham Biosciences). For the preparation of total cell extracts, cells (20 × 106 cells) were rinsed with PBS, scraped, and centrifuged. The pellet was rinsed with PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, 125 mm KCl, which contained protease inhibitors and 2% Igepal. The final concentration of the inhibitors was 0.5 mmol/liter PMSF, 1 mg/liter leupeptin, 1 mg/liter pepstatin, 1.5 mg/liter aprotinin, 2 mg/liter bestatin, and 0.4 mm sodium pervanadate. Samples were exposed to one cycle of freezing and thawing, incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was decanted, and protein concentration was measured (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Aliquots of total, nuclear, or cytosolic fractions containing 25–50 μg of protein were separated by reducing 10–12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Molecular weight standards (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were run simultaneously. Membranes were blotted overnight in 5% nonfat milk, incubated in the presence of corresponding antibodies for RelA, p50, phospho-IκBα, or IκBα (1:1000 dilution) for 90 min at 37 °C. After incubation, for 90 min at room temperature, in the presence of the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) (1:10,000 dilution), the conjugates were visualized by chemiluminescence detection in a PhosphorImager 640. Total RNA was isolated using a solution of acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) and electrophoresed on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels. After transferring the RNA to nylon membranes, it was hybridized in 6× SSC (1× SSC: 150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate), 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 5× Denhardt’s solution, 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 20 mg/ml sheared denatured salmon sperm DNA for 18 h at 42 °C with IκBα cDNA randomly labeled with [γ-32P]dCTP (106 cpm/ml hybridizing solution). Membranes were washed three times with a final stringency of 2× SCC (5 min at room temperature, followed by two washes of 15 and 30 min at 65 °C). Bands were visualized and quantitated using the PhosphorImager 640, and values were normalized to the signal obtained for 28 S mRNA. IMR-32 cells (2.5 × 106cells) were transfected with LipofectAMINETM 2000 according to the protocols of the manufacturer. As an internal control for transfection efficiency, a vector expressing β-galactosidase (2 μg of DNA) was co-transfected with the pNF-κB-Luc plasmid (1 μg of DNA). After 24 h of initiated transfection, cells were treated with the media containing varying concentrations of zinc. Cells were harvested 24 h later, and, after lysis, β-galactosidase and luciferase activities were determined following the protocols of the manufacturer. Cells (35 × 106) were rinsed three times with 0.1 m Pipes buffer, pH 7.0. Cells were manually homogenized using a glass homogenizer to a final volume of 0.4 ml. The homogenate was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C to allow microtubule depolymerization and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted, 200-μl aliquots were placed in a 96-well plate, and tubulin assembly was followed as the increase in absorbance at 340 nm for 90 min. The polymerization was started when the samples were placed at 37 °C in a PerkinElmer HTS 7000 Plus Bio Assay Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and was followed for 90 min. Cells were incubated for 24 h in control media and in the absence or the presence of 10 μm lactacystin. Apoptosis was evaluated by measuring DNA strand breaks using the APO-BRDUTM kit following the protocol of the manufacturer. The assay is based in the labeling of the 3′-hydroxyl termini of DNA strand breaks with bromolated deoxyuridine triphosphates, reaction catalyzed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme. These sites were identified by staining with a fluorescein-labeled anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody, and cells were analyzed on a Becton-Dickinson flow cytometer. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with subsequent post hoc comparisons by Scheffe were performed using Statview 512+ (Brainpower Inc., Calabazas, CA). Ap value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Values are given as means ± S.E. To assess whether variations in extracellular zinc concentrations were associated with changes in intracellular zinc pools, we followed changes in intracellular zinc concentrations over a 48-h period. TSQ is a lipid-soluble probe that can cross membranes and react with intracellular zinc. TSQ can bind to membrane zinc, and possibly to loosely bound zinc; both pools of zinc that are thought to be rapidly available for cellular requirements. Within 3 h intracellular zinc dropped in the 1.5 and 5 Zn groups (Fig.1). After 24 h, a 30–35% decrease in TSQ fluorescence was observed in the 1.5 and 5 Zn groups; by 48 h, values were decreased by 70 and 50%, respectively, compared with controls (Fig. 1). The amount of TSQ fluorescence in the 1.5 and 5 Zn groups was significantly lower (p < 0.02, one-way ANOVA test) than in the other three groups at all the time points studied. Intracellular zinc concentrations in cells incubated for 3–48 h in the chelated media containing 15 and 50 μm Zn, and the nonchelated control media, were similar. After 24 h, total intracellular zinc concentrations (nmol/mg protein) were lower (p < 0.01) in the 1.5 Zn (4.1 ± 0.3) and 5 Zn (4.6 ± 0.1) cells compared with the control (7.2 ± 0.3), 15 Zn (6.1 ± 0.9), and 50 Zn (6.4 ± 0.2) groups. Cellular copper and iron concentrations were similar among the groups. Exposure to the low zinc media did not affect the number of viable cells (determined by trypan blue exclusion) at either the 6- or 12-h time point (data not shown), but by 24 h, there was a decrease in the number of viable cells in the 1.5 and 5 μm Zn groups (35 and 28%, respectively). To investigate the total level of NF-κB activation, we measured the NF-κB-DNA binding activity in total cell fractions by EMSA, the phosphorylation, and the concentration of the inhibitory peptide IκBα by Western blot. The specificity of the NF-κB-DNA complex was assessed by competition with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing the consensus sequence for either NF-κB or OCT-1 (Fig.2A). At 24 h, the DNA binding activity of NF-κB in total cell fractions was higher in the 1.5 and 5 Zn cells than in the control, 15 Zn, and 50 Zn cells (Fig. 2,B and C). One of the required steps in the activation of NF-κB is, in general, the phosphorylation and degradation of an inhibitory IκB protein that prevents the translocation and binding of the active NF-κB dimer to DNA. IκBα concentration, and the extent of IκBα phosphorylation, were determined by Western blot in total cell fractions (Fig.3A). In agreement with the EMSA observations, the level of IκBα phosphorylation was 52 and 44% higher in the 1.5 and 5 Zn cells, respectively, compared with the control group. At 24 h, the concentration of IκBα measured by Western blot was ∼40% lower in the 1.5 and 5 Zn cells than in the control and 15 Zn groups (Fig. 3B). At 48 h, a similar pattern was observed, the concentration of IκBα was 30–60% lower in the 1.5 and 5 Zn cells than in the control and 15 Zn cells (data not shown). The content of p- IκBα and IκBα was referred to p50, as its concentration did not vary among groups (Fig. 3A). The ratio RelA/p50 was close to 1, and was similar in all the groups.Figure 3Phosphorylated IκBα, IκBα, p50, and RelA levels in total fractions isolated from IMR-32 cells. Fractions were isolated after 24 of exposure to control nonchelated media (C) or to chelated media containing 1.5 (1.5 Zn), 5 (5 Zn), 15 (15 Zn), or 50 (50 Zn) μm zinc.

Clegg M.S. Keen C.L. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and in 3T3 cells exposed to zinc-deficient media (9Oteiza P.I. Clegg M.S. Zago M.P. Keen C.L. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), that a low zinc status was associated with a low nuclear binding activity of NF-κB. In agreement with the above, in IMR-32 cells, after 24 h of incubation in the corresponding media, a reduced (p < 0.001) NF-κB nuclear binding activity was observed in the 1.5 and 5 Zn (69 and 57% reduction, respectively) cells, relative to the control group (Fig.4). Cells in the chelated media supplemented with 15 and 50 μm Zn showed values similar to those for the cells exposed to control nonchelated media. In contrast to the above, NF-κB binding activity in the cytosolic fraction was significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the 1.5 and 5 Zn cells than in the other groups (Fig. 4). The ratio of cytosolic/nuclear NF-κB binding activity was ∼6 and 4 times higher in the 1.5 and 5 Zn cells, respectively, than in the other three groups. We investigated whether the low nuclear binding of NF-κB to DNA could be caused by a requirement of zinc for an appropriate NF-κB-DNA interaction. Nuclear fractions from cells incubated in control and chelated media containing 1.5 μm zinc were added during the binding reaction with variable zinc concentrations (0.1–10 μm). The addition of zinc did not modify the nuclear binding of NF-κB to DNA (data not shown). To further characterize a possible association between low intracellular zinc concentrations and alterations in the nuclear translocation of the active NF-κB, we evaluated the concentrations of p50 and RelA in the nuclear fractions. The members of the Rel/NF-κB proteins present in the active NF-κB in IMR-32 cells were first characterized by an EMSA supershift assay. A control nuclear fraction was incubated in the presence of antibodies against RelA, p50, or p52, prior to the binding assay. The supershift assay showed that, in IMR-32 cells, the active NF-κB dimer is composed by RelA and p50 proteins (Fig. 5A). The content of RelA and p50 was determined by Western blot in the nuclear (Fig. 5B) and cytosolic fractions. A low ratio nuclear/cytosolic content for RelA and p50 was observed in the 1.5 and 5 Zn cells compared with that observed in the control, 15 Zn, and 50 Zn groups (Fig. 5C). The low IκBα protein levels in the 1.5 and 5 Zn cells could be the result in part of an increased degradation of the inhibitory peptide, secondary to NF-κB activation. However, because the transcription of the IκBα gene is controlled by NF-κB, a decrease in NF-κB-nuclear DNA binding could also lead to a decreased transactivation of the gene. As evaluated by Northern blot (Fig.6A), IκBα mRNA levels were lower in the 1.5 and 5 Zn cells than in the other groups. Expression of the results as the ratio IκBα/28 S mRNAs shows a 50% reduction in IκBα expression in the low zinc cells. The influence of variations in intracellular zinc on NF-κB-driven transactivating activity in IMR-32 cells was next tested using a reporter gene assay. Cells were co-transfected with a vector expressing β-galactosidase (as a control of the transfection efficiency) and pNF-κB-Luc plasmid. After 24 h of incubation in the different media, luciferase activity, corrected for β-galactosidase activity, was ∼40% lower in the 1.5 and 5 Zn cells than in the control and 15 Zn groups (Fig. 6B). The observation that alterations in tubulin polymerization can affect NF-κB activation and translocation (11Rosette C. Karin M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), combined with reports of impaired tubulin polymerization in brain extracts obtained from zinc-deficient animals (11Rosette C.

Fig.7A depicts the typical kinetics of tubulin polymerization in supernatants from control and 5 Zn cells. The rates of tubulin assembly were markedly lower in the 1.5 and 5 Zn (74 and 80%, respectively) cells than in control cells (p < 0.001). The tubulin polymerization rate in the 15 and 50 Zn cells was similar to values obtained for the control cells. Prior to the polymerization rea"

We have demonstrated that Fe65 is also a nuclear protein and APP functions as an extranuclear anchor, thus preventing Fe65 nuclear translocation. According to this finding, it was also demonstrated that Fe65 could play a role in the regulation of transcription. In the present paper we show that the overexpression of Fe65 prevents G1 → S cell cycle progression of serum-stimulated fibroblasts and that the contemporary overexpression of APP abolishes this effect of Fe65. The overexpression of Fe65 completely abolishes the activation of a key S phase gene, the thymidylate synthase (TS) gene, driven by the transcription factor LSF/CP2/LBP1 (LSF). This phenomenon is observed only in experimental conditions leading to the accumulation of Fe65 in the nucleus. Similarly, the two other members of the Fe65 protein family, Fe65L1 and Fe65L2, have been found to translocate into the nucleus and to prevent the activation of the TS gene promoter induced by LSF. Two results support the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of Fe65 on cell cycle progression in fibroblasts is the result of the inhibition of TS gene expression: (i) Fe65 overexpression, but not Fe65 and APP co-expression, prevents the accumulation of endogenous TS upon the exposure of cells to serum, and (ii) thymidine addition to the culture medium completely overcomes the growth arrest caused by Fe65. In neuronal PC12 cells, the overexpression of Fe65 or of Fe65L1 and Fe65L2 blocks cell cycle, as observed in fibroblasts, but thymidine supplementation to culture medium does not revert this block, thus suggesting that Fe65 proteins induce in neuronal cells a gene expression program different from that activated in fibroblasts.

In fact, the proteolytic processing of this protein gives rise to the Aβ peptide, the main constituent of the senile plaques, which represent the histologic hallmark of all the forms of this disease (for review, see Ref. 1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5134) Google Scholar). APP is a type I membrane protein, the functions of which are still unknown. It possesses a large extracellular/intraluminal domain and a short C-terminal cytosolic domain that is the center of a complex network of protein-protein interactions. A NPTY motif present in this cytodomain interacts with several PTB-containing proteins, such as those belonging to the Fe65 protein family (2Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A.

In cells expressing the nonreceptor Abl tyrosine kinase, the Tyr-682 is phosphorylated, thus creating a pYXXP motif, partially overlapping with the NPTY motif, which interacts with the SH2 domain of Abl itself (13Zambrano N.

Fe65 possesses three protein-protein interaction domains: a WW domain and two PTB domains, PTB1 and PTB2, through which it interacts with various proteins, in addition to APP. By using the two-hybrid screening procedure, we demonstrated that Fe65 PTB1 domain is able to interact with the transcription factor CP2/LSF/LBP1 (LSF) and that Fe65-LSF complexes can be found in cultured cells (15Zambrano N.

These observations suggest that the APP-Fe65 complex could be involved in the regulation of nuclear functions, probably in close connection with LSF and/or Tip60. LSF was originally identified as a transcription factor specifically binding to the SV40 major late promoter (19Kim C.H. Heath C. Bertuch A. Hansen U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In fact, a G → A polymorphism in the 3′-untranslated region of the LSF gene is significantly associated with AD susceptibility, with the A allele having a protective effect. In this paper we show that, in mouse fibroblasts, Fe65 overexpression blocks cell cycle progression and that this block is accompanied by the abolishment of thymidylate synthase accumulation, which follows growth factor stimulation and is relieved by the addition of exogenous thymidine to the culture medium. The observations that Fe65 overexpression prevents the LSF-mediated activation of the TS gene promoter and that all the described effects of Fe65 are erased by the contemporary overexpression of APP suggest a possible functional interplay between APP, Fe65, and thymidylate biosynthesis. In PC12 cells, a similar block of cell cycle progression is observed upon the overexpression of either Fe65 or Fe65L1 and Fe65L2, but this arrest is not prevented by exogenous thymidine, thus suggesting that, in neuronal cells, the Fe65 proteins induce a gene expression program different from that activated in fibroblasts. Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (HyClone). 3T3 cells were growth-arrested by incubation for 48 h in DMEM containing 0.5% calf serum and were stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle by the exposure to medium containing 10% calf serum. HeLa cells and HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from HyClone). PC12 cells were cultured in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Invitrogen), 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (HyClone). Mouse fibroblasts NIH 3T3 (1 × 106) were plated in 60-mm dishes, allowed to attach to the dish overnight, and transiently transfected with the appropriate plasmids (10 μg of total DNA) in the presence of trace amounts of a plasmid driving the expression of farnesylated EGFP (pfEGFP) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were starved in 0.5% calf serum for 48 h and then stimulated with 10% serum; where indicated, 20 μmthymidine was added at the time of serum stimulation. At each time point, cells were dissociated from the plates with trypsin and washed with PBS without CaCl2 and MgCl2. Cells were then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min, washed twice, and fixed in 70% ethanol in PBS. Following another wash in the PBS without CaCl2 and MgCl2, cells were treated with 10 μg/ml RNase A and then stained with 25 μg/ml propidium iodide. Transfected cells were selected for analysis of DNA content (as measured by monitoring fluorescence from propidium iodide) by gating on fluorescein isothiocyanate-positive cells because of fEGFP, using FACScan (BD PharMingen, San Jose, CA) interfaced with a Hewlett Packard computer (Palo Alto, CA). Cell cycle analysis was performed by CELL-FIT program (BD PharMingen). In the incorporation experiments, 2 × 106 PC12 cells were grown on polylysine-pre-coated glass coverslips in 60-mm dishes and transfected with the appropriate GFP-Fe65 vectors (10 μg of DNA) by using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Thymidine (ICN) was added to the medium 5 h after transfection at a final concentration of 20 μm. Thirty-six hours after transfection, cells were incubated with 10 μm 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h. Cells on coverslips were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS, pH 7.4), permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 and incubated with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine Labeling and Detection Kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the instructions of the supplier; then the cells were stained with Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). The coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem) onto a glass microscope slide, and fluorescence was examined using an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss). To measure the percentage of apoptotic cells, PC12 cells were cultured on coverslips as described above. Thirty-six hours after transfection with CMV empty vector or with CMV-Fe65 vector (12Zambrano N. Buxbaum J.D. Minopoli G. Fiore F., De Candia P., De Renzis S. Faraonio R. Sabo S. Cheetham J. Sudol M.

The GFP-Fe65L1-expressing vector was obtained by cloning into the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH) the DNA fragment amplified using as template the human Fe65L1 cDNA (kind gift of S. Guenette) with the following specific oligonucleotide primers (CEINGE): forward (5′-GAGCTCAAGCTTCGAGACACACAC GGACACACAG-3′) and reverse (5′-GACCGCGGGCCCCTATGGCATTTCGGTGACAGGG-3′). The Fe65L2-GFP vector was obtained through the amplification of the rat Fe65L2 cDNA (7Duilio A. Faraonio R. Minopoli G. Zambrano N. Russo T. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with the following specific oligonucleotide primers (CEINGE): forward (5′-GAGCTCAAGCTTGCAGCCAACATGCTGGGCAAGGATTATATGCTGG-3′) and reverse (5′-GACCGCGGGCCCGCAGAACCCTAGGGACTGGAAG-3′). For fluorescence microscopy experiments, 5 × 105 NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were plated on glass coverslips and co-transfected with the appropriate GFP vector with or without the CMV-APP695 expression vector, using FuGENE reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% in PBS, pH 7.4) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. APP was stained with 6E10 monoclonal antibody (Senetec) using a Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). HeLa cells (6 × 105) or HEK293 cells (7.5 × 105) were plated in 60-mm dishes, allowed to attach to the dish overnight, and transiently transfected with the appropriate plasmids (10 μg of total DNA) using LipofectAMINE plus (Invitrogen). At 36–48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and CAT assays were performed using a colorimetric CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The TS-CAT construct was obtained by cloning in the pCAT-basic vector the fragment from −113 to −19 of the mouse thymidylate synthase promoter. This fragment was generated by filling-in two overlapping annealed oligonucleotides (TS F: 5′-AAA TTT AAG CTT CTG GCG GCC GGA AGT TTC CCA GCA GGA AGA GGC GGG CTG GTG TTG GAG GAA AAG AGC-3′; TS R: 5′-AAA TTT TCT AGA CAG TGT AGT CAG CGA CAA AAC CAG GAC CTT CCT GGC GCT CTT TTC CTC CAA CAC CAG-3′) with DNA polymerase Klenow fragment and dNTP. The TS-l-CAT construct contained the region from −985 to −11 of the mouse thymidylate synthase gene promoter and was generated as described in Ref. 22Powell C.M. Rudge T.L. Zhu Q. Johnson L.F. Hansen U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Expression vectors encoding wild type and mutant Fe65, APP695, and LSF (pEF-1α LSF) have been described previously (15Zambrano N.

For Western blot analysis, transiently transfected cells (HeLa, HEK 293) were harvested in cold TEN (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) and resuspended in Lysis Buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mmEGTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 400 mm NaCl). Total extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g at 4 °C, and protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad assay according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Extract (20 μg) was electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Filters were then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T solution and incubated with appropriate dilutions of the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The excess was removed by sequential washing of the membranes in PBS-T, and then a 1:5000 dilution of the appropriate secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated) was added to the filters for 30 min at room temperature. The anti-Fe65 antiserum used in this study has been previously described (12Zambrano N. Buxbaum J.D. Minopoli G. Fiore F., De Candia P., De Renzis S. Faraonio R. Sabo S. Cheetham J. Sudol M. Russo T.

A rabbit anti-LSF serum was generated against the synthetic peptide NH2-CLPLADEVIETGLVQD-COOH, by immunizing one rabbit with the peptide conjugated to chicken serum albumin (PRIMM). The antibody against APP is the monoclonal antibody 6E10 (SENETK PLC); the antibody against green fluorescent protein is the monoclonal antibody anti-GFP JL8 (CLONTECH). Signals were detected by chemiluminescence, using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). For Western analysis of TS protein levels, cytoplasmic extracts of 3T3 cells, starved from serum and then restimulated for 22 h with 10% calf serum, were prepared by lysing the cells, plated at 1 × 106 cells/dish, in 20 μl of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μg/ml leupeptin (25Johnston P.G. Lenz H.J. Leichman C.G. Danenberg K.D. Allegra C.J. Danenberg P.V. Leichman L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1407-1412PubMed Google Scholar). Five micrograms of each extract were resolved by SDS-PAGE through a 12% polyacrylamide gel (37.5:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. The filter was then blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-T solution and probed with a TS monoclonal antibody (TS 106) (26Johnston P.G. Liang C.M. Henry S. Chabner B.A. Allegra C.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6668-6676PubMed Google Scholar). The blot was re-probed with a β-actin monoclonal antibody (clone AC-15) (Sigma). Signals were detected using the ECF system (AmershamBiosciences) and quantitated on a STORM 840 chemifluorescence detector (Amersham Biosciences). We had observed that various cell lines transfected with Fe65 expression vectors grew more slowly than mock-transfected cells. For example, in HEK293 cells transfected with an expression vector encoding a GFP-tagged Fe65 (17Minopoli G. de Candia P. Bonetti A. Faraonio R. Zambrano N. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6545-6550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or with a vector driving the expression of GFP alone, fluorescent and nonfluorescent cells were counted at various times after transfection. In these conditions, although percentage of GFP-expressing cells does not significantly change during the first 72 h after transfection, the percentage of GFP-Fe65-expressing cells is decreased at 72 h compared with those observed at 24 h after transfection. This observation suggests that the transfection of Fe65 has some inhibitory effect on the cell growth; therefore, we analyzed by flow cytometry the DNA content of cells overexpressing Fe65 at various times after growth factor stimulation. To this aim, NIH3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with Fe65 or with empty vector, together with a fluorescent marker, the membrane-anchored fEGFP. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cell growth was arrested by serum withdrawal for 48 h, and 16 and 22 h after serum restimulation, the DNA content of sorted fluorescent cells was measured. As shown in Fig.1 (panels A andB), cells transfected with vector alone normally progressed through the cell cycle following serum stimulation, whereas Fe65 transfected cells showed, at 16 and 22 h after serum stimulation, a DNA content profile similar to that observed in starved cells with most of the cells blocked in G1, with no sign of apoptosis. Several results suggest that Fe65 could play some role in gene regulation (15Zambrano N. Minopoli G. de Candia P. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20128-20133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 16Cao X. Südhof T.C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5269-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On this basis, it can be speculated that the above reported effects on cell cycle progression could be because of a direct or indirect effect of Fe65 on gene expression. To explore this possibility, we first examined whether or not the presence of Fe65 in the nucleus is necessary to observe the above described effects on cell cycle progression. We previously demonstrated that Fe65 is efficiently translocated into the nucleus and that the co-expression of wild type Fe65 with APP prevents Fe65 nuclear translocation, thus demonstrating that APP functions as an extranuclear anchor, which prevents Fe65 from being translocated to the nucleus (17Minopoli G. de Candia P. Bonetti A. Faraonio R. Zambrano N. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6545-6550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows that the co-expression of APP with Fe65 completely abolishes the block of cell cycle progression observed overexpressing Fe65 alone. This result strongly supports the possibility that the Fe65-dependent effect on the cell cycle is associated with the presence of Fe65 in the nucleus. We demonstrated that Fe65 interacts in vivo with the transcription factor LSF (15Zambrano N. Minopoli G. de Candia P. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20128-20133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This protein is known to activate, in a cell cycle-dependent fashion, the transcription of the gene encoding the thymidylate synthase (22Powell C.M. Rudge T.L. Zhu Q. Johnson L.F. Hansen U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme plays a key role in the S phase of the cell cycle, being responsible for the generation of thymidine nucleotide necessary for DNA synthesis. These data suggest the possibility that Fe65 could affect TS gene activation directed by LSF and, in turn, that the effects of Fe65 on cell cycle progression could be the consequence of an inhibition of TS gene expression. Therefore, we decided to examine the possible effect of Fe65 overexpression on the LSF-mediated transactivation of the TS gene promoter. To do this, a reporter gene vector has been generated in which the CAT gene transcription is under the control of a fragment of the mouse TS gene spanning from −113 to −19 (TS-CAT) in which the LSF-binding site is present. This vector was transfected in various cell lines with or without the LSF expression vector. According to previous results (22Powell C.M. Rudge T.L. Zhu Q. Johnson L.F. Hansen U. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in all the cell lines tested the transient expression of LSF resulted in a significant enhancement of the TS gene promoter efficiency. Fig.2 A shows the results obtained in HeLa cells and in HEK293 cells. The effect of Fe65 on the activation of the TS gene promoter induced by LSF was analyzed by co-transfecting the TS-CAT vector with both LSF and Fe65 expression vectors. The result of this experiment shows that Fe65 completely abolishes the activation of the TS gene promoter provoked by LSF. This inhibition is specific, considering that the expression of the RSV-CAT reporter gene, in which the CAT expression is driven by the RSV-long terminal repeat, is not affected by the overexpression of either LSF or Fe65 or both. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of the extracts from transfected cells shows that the amounts of LSF never varied as a consequence of Fe65 overexpression. Similar results have been obtained by using a second construct in which the TS promoter region, directing the transcription of the CAT gene, includes other 872 nucleotides upstream the −113 to −19 fragment containing the LSF binding sites. As shown in Fig. 2 B, by using this construct (TS-L-CAT), the CAT gene is transcribed at high levels, even in basal conditions, LSF transient transfection enhances the transcription, whereas Fe65 overexpression abolishes the LSF-mediated promoter activation. As for the effects of Fe65 on the cell cycle, the effects of Fe65 on the TS gene promoter regulation also depend on the presence of Fe65 in the nucleus. In fact, we co-transfected HeLa cells with LSF and the construct expressing the GFP-Fe65Δ1–287 mutant protein, which fails to translocate to the nucleus (17Minopoli G. de Candia P. Bonetti A. Faraonio R. Zambrano N. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6545-6550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The efficiency of this protein to inhibit the LSF-mediated TS gene promoter activation is significantly lower than that of wild type Fe65, whereas another mutant protein, GFP-Fe65Δ1–253, which is still translocated to the nucleus, completely abolishes the effects of LSF on the TS gene promoter, like wild type Fe65 (see Fig. 3 A). In agreement with these results, the co-expression of APP with Fe65, which results in the exclusion of Fe65 from the nucleus, erases the inhibitory effect of"

Herein, we show that phosphorylation of VASP is dynamically regulated by cellular adhesion to extracellular matrix. Detachment of cells stimulated PKA activity and induced PKA-dependent phosphorylation of VASP and the related murine-Enabled (Mena) protein. VASP and Mena were rapidly dephosphorylated immediately following reattachment but showed an intermediate level of phosphorylation during active cell spreading. This pattern correlated closely with adhesion-dependent changes in PKA activity. The in vivo interaction of VASP with the Abl tyrosine kinase, shown here for the first time, was readily apparent in adherent cells, lost following cellular detachment, and induced upon reattachment to matrix. Importantly, inhibition of PKA activity prevented phosphorylation of VASP and dissociation of VASP-Abl complexes after cellular detachment, whereas activation of PKA completely eliminated the co-immunoprecipitation of Abl activity with VASP. These data establish a new biochemical link between cell adhesion and regulation of VASP proteins and provide the first demonstration of a regulated interaction between VASP and Abl in mammalian cells.

Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxic. 2002; 42: 283-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The influence of cell adhesion stems from both the physical anchoring afforded by integrin-ECM interaction and generation of signals that communicate the state of adhesion to the cell interior (1Juliano R.L.

One of the most important responses to these signals is the assembly and organization of the cytoskeleton, particularly actin microfilaments. Integrity of the actin cytoskeleton establishes, maintains, and monitors cell shape and is required for efficient transduction of signals initiated by receptors at the cell surface, such as receptors for growth factors and G-protein agonists (1Juliano R.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxic. 2002; 42: 283-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat.

Thus, identifying targets of adhesion-dependent signaling that regulate the cytoskeleton is an important step toward understanding how adhesion influences cell behavior. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is activated upon both cellular detachment (5Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat.

Indeed, some facets of cytoskeletal assembly and integrity require PKA activity (e.g. activation of Rac (6O'Connor K.L. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol.

These ostensibly disparate observations outline a complex role for PKA in cytoskeletal regulation and suggest that factors that regulate the actin cytoskeleton may be affected by anchorage-dependent changes in PKA activity. As a major substrate for PKA and a crucial regulator of actin dynamics, the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) is an excellent candidate target for anchorage-dependent regulation by PKA. The VASP family of actin regulatory proteins (including theDrosophila-Enabled (Ena) protein, its mammalian homolog (Mena), and the Ena/VASP-like protein (Evl)) share a common, three-domain structure comprising an N-terminal Ena/VASP homology (EVH) type 1 domain, a central Pro-rich region, and a C-terminal EVH2 domain (13Gertler F.B.

For murine VASP, phosphorylation occurs at three residues: Ser-153 near the Pro-rich region and Ser-235 and Thr-274 in EVH2 (positions 157, 239, and 278 in human VASP) (14Reinhard M. Jarchau T.

Although each site can be modified by both PKA and the cGMP-dependent protein kinase, Ser-153 is the preferred target for PKA (23Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J.

PKA-mediated phosphorylation of VASP and Evl decreases but does not completely eliminate their ability to nucleate, bind, and bundle actin filaments (22Lambrechts A. Kwiatkowski A.V. Lanier L.M.

For example, phosphorylation of Evl by PKA has been shown to abolish its interaction with Abl and neuronal Src SH3 domains (22Lambrechts A. Kwiatkowski A.V. Lanier L.M. Bear J.E. Vandekerckhove J.

And althoughDrosophila Ena is not phosphorylated by PKA, it is Tyr-phosphorylated by Abl near the Pro-rich region (26Gertler F.B. Comer A.R. Juang J.L. Ahern S.M. Clark M.J. Liebl E.C. Hoffmann F.M.

Interestingly, phosphorylation near the Pro-rich region of VASP proteins does not disrupt profilin binding and has no effect on EVH1-mediated interactions or EVH2-mediated oligomerization (13Gertler F.B.

Thus, the interaction of VASP proteins with SH3 domains may represent a specific target for regulation by PKA. This report unites the concepts discussed above by demonstrating that cell adhesion dynamically regulates PKA activity, which in turn regulates VASP phosphorylation and interaction with Abl in vivo. Antibodies against VASP include: a mouse monoclonal (Transduction Laboratories), diluted 1:1000 for immunoblotting REF52 and MDCK lysates; a rabbit polyclonal (Alexis Biochemicals), used for immunoblotting (at 1:2000) and immunoprecipitation (at 1 μl of antibody per 200 μg of cell lysate) from NIH3T3 cells; a phospho-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody, used at 1:1000 to visualize phosphorylation at Ser-153 (a generous gift of Dr. Qingyuan Ye (Cell Signaling)); and a phospho-specific polyclonal, used at 1:500 to visualize phosphorylation at Ser-235 (Upstate Biotechnology). A mouse monoclonal IgA antibody (Transduction Laboratories) was used at 1:500 to visualize Mena. Antibodies to Abl include a monoclonal (8E9; Transduction Laboratories), used at 1:250 for immunoblotting, and a rabbit polyclonal (K12; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), used for immunoprecipitation and kinase assays as described below and elsewhere (28Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Epitope-tagged VASP was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody against a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein antigen (BD Biosciences). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Calbiochem and routinely used at 1:5000. NIH3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM with 10% bovine calf serum. REF52 and WI38 fibroblasts and MDCK epithelial cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. Neo and dnPKA cells were maintained in NIH3T3 medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml active G418. ECV304 endothelial cells were maintained in Medium 199 with 10% fetal bovine serum. For all cell lines and experiments, cells were grown to near-confluence, then serum-starved overnight (12–16 h) in media containing 0.1% serum. Forskolin (Fsk) and isobutyl methylxanthine (IBMX) (Sigma) were dissolved in Me2SO and added to cells (at 25 and 50 μm, respectively) for 20 min. PDGF-BB (Upstate Biotechnology) was used at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml. Detachment and replating on fibronectin (FN)- or collagen-coated plates was performed as described (5Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA and collected into DMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. After centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g, cells were washed once and resuspended in DMEM-BSA, then incubated in suspension with gentle rotation for the indicated period of time. For replating, 10-cm Petri dishes were coated with PBS containing 10 μg/ml FN (BD Life Sciences) or 20 μg/ml type-I collagen from rat tail (Biomedical Technologies Inc.) for 2 h at room temperature, then washed with PBS, and blocked for 30 min with DMEM + 2% BSA. A pcDNA3-based plasmid encoding VSV-tagged human VASP (24Smolenski A. Bachmann C. Reinhard K. Honig-Liedl P. Jarchau T. Hoschuetzky H. Walter U. J. Biol.

Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), were transfected into NIH3T3 cells using SuperFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four h later, cells were serum-starved and cultured as described above. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, then lysed in Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, using 750 μl per 10-cm dish. After 10 min on ice, lysates were scraped into microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge) for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of the supernatant lysate was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). For direct immunoblotting, aliquots of lysate were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min before loading on 10% (for VASP) or 7.5% (for Mena and Abl) SDS-PAGE gels. For VASP immunoprecipitation, 0.8–1.0 mg of protein was incubated with anti-VASP or anti-VSV antibody for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected by incubation with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed four times with lysis buffer, then resuspended, and boiled in 1× Laemmli sample buffer. For some experiments, polyclonal VASP antibody was chemically cross-linked to beads using dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce) according to the supplier's protocol. Abl immunoprecipitation kinase assays were performed essentially as described elsewhere (28Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Briefly, c-Abl was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of protein using 2 μg of K12 anti-Abl antibody. Immunocomplexes were washed twice with lysis buffer supplemented with 0.1% SDS and 1% sodium deoxycholate, twice with lysis buffer, twice with lysis buffer without NaCl, and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). VASP immunoprecipitates were prepared and processed for Abl kinase activity by immunoprecipitating VASP from 1 mg of protein and washing immunocomplexes six times with lysis buffer then twice with kinase buffer. Kinase reactions were carried out in 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 1 μm ATP, 5μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.5 μg of GST-Crk and were incubated for 40 min at 27 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Reaction products were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, which were Coomassie-stained, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate (Molecular Dynamics). For kinase assays using a peptide substrate instead of GST-Crk, reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 100 mm EDTA and 20 μl of the stopped reaction was spotted onto phosphocellulose columns (Pierce), which were subsequently washed twice with 150 mmphosphoric acid and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. PKA activity was measured exactly as described previously (5Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells in suspension or on FN-coated plates were rapidly washed twice with ice-cold PBS, then resuspended or covered in PKA assay buffer and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Lysates were thawed on ice, scraped into tubes (for adherent cells), then sonicated and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were assayed for PKA activity by measuring transfer of radioactive phosphate from ATP into Kemptide (Sigma) in the presence or absence of purified PKI (Cell Signaling). To investigate whether VASP phosphorylation is affected by changes in cell adhesion, NIH3T3 cells were serum-starved overnight, then left untreated, stimulated with Fsk + IBMX for 20 min or detached and incubated in suspension for 1 h. Extracts were then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-VASP antibodies. Phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-153, the preferred PKA site, but not at Ser-235 or Thr-274, causes a significant electrophoretic mobility shift of VASP on SDS-PAGE gels (23Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Smolenski A. Bachmann C. Reinhard K. Honig-Liedl P. Jarchau T. Hoschuetzky H.

In untreated, stably adherent cells, VASP was predominantly in the faster migrating, unphosphorylated form (Fig. 1 A). Detachment of cells induced phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-153 almost as efficiently as treatment with Fsk + IBMX. (Fig. 1 A). This effect was confirmed by immunoblotting with a phospho-specific antibody that recognizes VASP only when phosphorylated near the Pro-rich region (pSer-153 in murine and pSer-157 in human VASP; Fig. 1 B). Detachment-induced phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-153 (or the analogous position) was observed in several cell lines, including rat embryo fibroblasts (Fig. 1 A, REF52), MDCK epithelial cells (Fig. 1 C), and in human fibroblast (WI38) and endothelial (ECV304) cell lines (data not shown). As apparent in Fig. 1 B, a higher molecular weight band was routinely detected in immunoblots using the phospho-Ser 153 antibody and behaved similarly to VASP in response to various experimental treatments, suggesting that it may be a VASP family member. Mena has at least three splice variants, generating proteins of 80, 88, and 140 kDa (13Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), and thus represented a likely candidate for this protein. Moreover, because Mena, like VASP, is expressed in fibroblasts and epithelial cells, is phosphorylated by PKA, and exhibits altered mobility when phosphorylated (13Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), the effect of detachment on Mena phosphorylation was directly investigated. Like VASP, Mena was phosphorylated both in cells treated with Fsk + IBMX and, significantly, in cells placed in suspension (Fig. 1 D). The mobility shift of VASP proteins is due to phosphorylation near the Pro-rich region. To determine whether detachment also affected phosphorylation near the EVH2 domain, immunoblots were probed with a phospho-Ser-239 specific antibody. The basal level of Ser-239 phosphorylation in quiescent, adherent cells did not increase following detachment (Fig. 1 E). In total, these data demonstrate that cellular detachment induces phosphorylation of VASP family proteins specifically near the Pro-rich region at sites preferred by PKA. To determine if the detachment-induced phosphorylation of VASP and Mena was reversible, detached cells were replated onto dishes coated with FN (for fibroblasts) or type-I collagen (for epithelial cells) and harvested for immunoblot analysis. Both Ser-153 of VASP and the equivalent residue near the Pro-rich region of Mena were rapidly dephosphorylated following adhesion to ECM as judged by the increased electrophoretic mobility of the proteins (Fig. 1, C–E). Interestingly, although detachment did not promote significant phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-235, this site, like Ser-153, was rapidly dephosphorylated upon adhesion to ECM (Fig.1 E). To further investigate the dynamics of regulation of VASP phosphorylation by adhesion, a detailed time course was performed (Fig.2 A). Conversion of VASP to its phospho-Ser 153 form was more than 60% complete within 10 min after NIH3T3 cell detachment and more than 95% complete after 1 h (Fig.2 A, left panel). Interestingly, the rapid and complete dephosphorylation of Ser-153 seen early after adhesion to FN was followed by a period of intermediate phosphorylation as cells continued to spread (Fig. 2 A, right panel and B). By 1 h after plating, VASP phosphorylation returned to a low baseline level equivalent to that seen in stably adherent cells (Fig. 2 A, right panel and B). A similar bi-phasic course of phosphorylation, with slightly different kinetics, was observed in epithelial cells that had been detached and replated onto collagen (Fig. 2 C). Light microscopy showed both cell types to be firmly attached but rounded at the early time points during which Ser-153 was dephosphorylated (data not shown). During the later time points at which VASP phosphorylation was intermediate, cells were actively spreading and exhibited multiple lamellipodia and extensive membrane ruffling, while the later decrease in phosphorylation corresponded with a contractile, polygonal morphology. These data suggest that phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-153 changes dynamically in response to changes in cell adhesion and also during cell spreading. The increase in Ser-153 phosphorylation of VASP during cell spreading suggested that PKA might become activated over the same time course. To address this, PKA activity was measured in NIH3T3 cells at various times after detachment and replating onto FN (Fig. 2 D). As reported previously (5Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), PKA activity was high in cells soon after detachment but decreased as cells remained in suspension. The observed decrease in PKA activity with prolonged incubation in suspension is in contrast to the sustained phosphorylation of VASP at Ser-153 (compare Fig. 2 A,left panel withD). The reasons for this disparity are currently unknown. However, following adhesion to FN, PKA activity decreased initially but increased during cell spreading and returned to baseline at later time points, a time course that closely paralleled Ser-153 phosphorylation. These data correlate changes in PKA activity with changes in VASP phosphorylation at Ser-153 during cell adhesion and cell spreading. Adhesion-dependent changes in VASP phosphorylation near the Pro-rich region at Ser-153 may affect VASP interaction with SH3 domains in vivo. To investigate this, VASP immunoprecipitates from stably adherent and detached cells w"

Rap1b is phosphorylated and activated by cAMP, and its expression in cells where cAMP is mitogenic leads to an increase in G1/S phase entry and tumor formation. The PCCL3 thyroid follicular cells represent a differentiated and physiologically relevant system that requires thyrotropin (TSH), acting via cAMP, for a full mitogenic response. In this model system, cAMP stimulation of DNA synthesis requires activation and phosphorylation of Rap1b by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). This scenario presents the challenge of identifying biochemical processes involved in the phosphorylation-dependent Rap1b mitogenic action. In thyroid cells, Akt has been implicated in the stimulation of cell proliferation by TSH and cAMP. However, the mechanism(s) by which cAMP regulates Akt activity remains unclear. In this study we show that in PCCL3 cells 1) TSH inhibits Akt activity via cAMP and PKA; 2) Rap1b is required for cAMP inhibition of Akt; and 3) transduction of the cAMP signal into Akt requires activation as well as phosphorylation of Rap1b by PKA.

Notwithstanding the recent importance given to cAMP inhibition of cell proliferation (34Graves L. Lawrence J., Jr. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 43-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), cAMP is mitogenic for numerous cell types, notably in primary cultures of epithelial cells and particularly those of endocrine origin (24Dumont J.E. Jauniaux J.C. Roger P.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 67-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 26Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The fundamental aspect of this cAMP mitogenic action is to interact synergistically with mitogens that do not signal via cAMP (35Rozengurt E. Science. 1986; 234: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). cAMP rapidly phosphorylates (36Altschuler D. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7527-7531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activates the G-protein Rap1b (37Altschuler D.L. Peterson S.N. Ostrowski M.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10373-10376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Exogenous expression of Rap1b in Swiss3T3 cells is associated with an increase in cAMP-mediated G1/S phase entry and with the development of tumors when these cells are transplanted into nude mice (38Altschuler D.L. Ribeiro-Neto F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This mitogenic action of Rap1b can be recapitulated in a differentiated and physiologically relevant model, thyroid follicular cells, a system that requires the trophic factor thyrotropin (TSH), acting through cAMP for a full mitogenic response (40Medina D.L. Santisteban P. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Additionally, inhibition of Rap1b activity in these cells impairs TSH/cAMP mitogenic activity, implicating Rap1b as a critical player in cAMP mitogenic action (39Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, we have proposed that Rap1b transduces the cAMP mitogenic signal (38Altschuler D.L. Ribeiro-Neto F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 39Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Likewise, Rap1b mediates cAMP inhibition of cell proliferation (41Schmitt J.M. Stork P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3671-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), lending strong support to the notion that Rap1b affects mitogenesis conditionally to the role that cAMP has in cell proliferation (38Altschuler D.L.

S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because both cAMP stimulation (38Altschuler D.L. Ribeiro-Neto F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 39Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2001; 21: 3671-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) of mitogenesis are processes intimately linked with Rap1b activity, a question arises on whether Akt represents a target for Rap1b action downstream of cAMP. In this report, we studied the effects of TSH or cAMP on Akt activity in thyroid follicular cells. We found that cAMP signaling, in a PKA-dependent fashion, rapidly inhibits Akt activity in ways that require activation and PKA phosphorylation of Rap1b. Forskolin, IBMX, and H89 were obtained from Calbiochem. Phosphorylation-specific (Ser473, Thr308) and phosphorylation state-independent rabbit polyclonal anti-Akt antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Antibodies against HA (HA.11) and Myc (9E10) were from Berkeley Antibody. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Crosstide was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Protein G-Sepharose was from AmershamBiosciences. PCCL3 cells were cultured in Coon’s modified Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 4 hormones: TSH (1 milliunit/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), transferring (5 μg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 nm) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. HA-tagged WT-Akt, HA-RapGAP, Myc-Epac constructs, and Myc- and HA-tagged Rap1b constructs (wild type, dominant-negative Rap1-N17 and Rap1-N17-S179A, and constitutively active Rap1-G12V and Rap1-G12V-S179A) were used in this study. PCCL3 cells were plated in 6-well plates. One day later, cells (∼60% confluent) were transfected with the indicated plasmids (1.5 μg of DNA/well) using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After a 24-h recovery, cells were starved in Coon’s medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and transferrin (5 μg/ml) for 16 h before treatment and harvest. For total lysates, cells were harvested in SDS sample buffer. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking in 5% non-fat milk membranes were probed with the appropriate primary antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by a chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Specific bands were quantified by image analysis using Bio-Rad Molecular Dynamics software. After treatment with the indicated agents, PCCL3 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaF, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and HA-Akt was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA (HA.11) antibody followed by protein G-Sepharose purification. After washing the immunocomplexes samples were separated into two equal parts and used for Western blot analysis and kinase activity assay, respectively. Kinase activity was determined using crosstide as a substrate in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, 30 μm crosstide, 3 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 50 units/ml of heat-stable inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The phosphorylation reaction proceeded for 30 min at 30 °C, was terminated by spotting 25 μl of sample onto a Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper, and was immediately immersed into 75 mm orthophosphoric acid. After several washes, the filters were rinsed in ethanol and air-dried. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. Background obtained from cells transfected with empty-vector were subtracted from all values. The effects of cAMP signaling agents such as TSH and forskolin on Akt phosphorylation investigated using selective phosphospecific antibodies for the phosphorylated forms of Thr308 or Ser473 are shown in Fig. 1. A rapid and transient inhibition of basal Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 was observed upon exposure of quiescent cells (serum- and TSH-starved for 16 h) to TSH (Fig. 1A) or forskolin (Fig.1B). Half-maximal inhibition was seen as early as 2 min, and by 5 min either TSH or forskolin maximally inhibited Thr308phosphorylation. Thereafter, phosphorylation of Akt-T308 gradually resumed, returning to basal levels within 60 min upon addition of cAMP signaling agents. Maximal stimulation of Akt activity requires phosphorylation of Thr308 as well as Ser473. cAMP signaling by TSH or forskolin inhibited Akt-S473 phosphorylation with initial rates similar to those displayed by the inhibition of Akt-T308 phosphorylation; however, in contrast, Ser473phosphorylation remained inhibited for as long as 60 min after cAMP signaling. Neither TSH nor forskolin significantly affected Akt protein levels (Fig. 1, A and B). Analysis of Thr308 and Ser473 phosphorylation, normalized to total Akt protein levels, clearly shows the differential effects of cAMP signaling on the phosphorylation dynamics of Thr308and Ser473. Although cAMP signaling inhibits Akt-T308 phosphorylation transiently, the inhibition of Ser473displays a sustained kinetic profile. TSH, acting via cAMP, or insulin alone has little mitogenic effect on thyroid cells (40Medina D.L. Santisteban P. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 42Kimura T. Van Keymeulen A. Golstein J. Fusco A. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 631-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, TSH displays strong mitogenic effect in the presence of insulin, a potent activator of Akt (8Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of cAMP signaling on insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation. Insulin strongly stimulated Akt phosphorylation reaching maximal activity within 2 min and lasting for at least 1 h (not shown). However, if cells were exposed to TSH (Fig. 2A) or forskolin (Fig.2B) for only 5 min prior to stimulation with insulin, a marked reduction of Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 was observed. Results with phosphospecific antibodies were also confirmed by activity as measured in vitro in an immunocomplex kinase assay using the crosstide peptide as a substrate (43Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4392) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results using Akt phosphospecific antibodies, TSH or forskolin inhibited both basal and insulin-stimulated Akt activity by about 4-fold (Fig. 2C), indicating that cAMP inhibition of Akt activity is a stable process, which endures isolation of the kinase by immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, when Akt activity was maximally stimulated by a brief exposure to insulin for 5 min and subsequently exposed to forskolin for only 5 min, a marked inhibition of Akt phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 2D). These results reveal an outweighing effect of cAMP signaling on Akt as cAMP either prevents or inhibits insulin-stimulated Akt activity. TSH induces proliferation of thyroid follicular cells via cAMP and PKA (40Medina D.L. Santisteban P. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 143: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 42Kimura T. Van Keymeulen A. Golstein J. Fusco A. Dumont J.E. Roger P.P. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 631-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Although PKA is a critical target for most of the biological actions of cAMP, cAMP can affect biochemical processes independently of PKA. Such is the case for a newly identified family of proteins containing a cAMP binding domain and, in addition, with guanine nucleotide exchange activity (GEFs) for Ras and Rap (44Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 45de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J.

Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In vitro direct binding of cAMP to these GEFs leads to the exchange of GTP for GDP independently of PKA phosphorylation (45de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). A possible involvement of cAMP and PKA in TSH inhibition of Akt predicts that drugs that stabilize cAMP levels should potentiate cAMP inhibition of Akt. Likewise, specific PKA inhibitors should block cAMP inhibition of Akt. For this, we tested the effects of IBMX (a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and H89 (a specific PKA inhibitor) on forskolin inhibition of insulin-stimulated Akt activity. In the absence of IBMX, forskolin inhibited insulin-stimulated Akt in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of about 0.1 μm forskolin (Fig.3A). However, in the presence of IBMX, a strong potentiation of this response was observed (Fig.3B). Pretreatment of cells with the selective PKA inhibitor H89 completely abolished the inhibition of insulin-stimulated Akt activity by forskolin (Fig. 3C) or TSH (not shown). It is evident that cAMP inhibition of Akt activity requires a catalytic active PKA (Fig. 3D). The data indicate that Akt activity is under a tonic inhibitory control mediated by PKA. We have shown previously that in cells where cAMP is a co-mitogen, such as Swiss3T3 (38Altschuler D.L. Ribeiro-Neto F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and PCCL3 (39Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), Rap1b expression enhances cAMP-mediated G1/S entry. Moreover, in the model system used here both activation and PKA phosphorylation of Rap1b are needed for TSH/cAMP-mediated G1/S entry (39Ribeiro-Neto F. Urbani J. Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These results suggested that Rap1b is an effector of cAMP biological activity and thus a potential mediator of the inhibitory effects of cAMP on Akt activity. To assess this possibility we have studied the effects of several constructs able to interfere with Rap1b activity. Expression of Rap1b-WT leads to a 50% inhibition of basal Akt phosphorylation while enhancing the ability of forskolin to further inhibit this process (Fig. 4A). If Rap1b activation is sufficient to mediate cAMP inhibition of Akt, then Rap1b-G12V (a constitutively active form of Rap1b) should mimic cAMP action. Expression of Rap1b-G12V greatly inhibited Akt phosphorylation in the absence of a cAMP stimulus, indicating that Rap1b-G12V behaves as an authentic mimetic of cAMP signaling to Akt (Fig. 4B). The inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by Rap1b, as seen with cAMP, correlates with its effect on Akt kinase activity (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that activation of endogenous Rap1b by cAMP is sufficient to inhibit Akt activity. If activation of endogenous Rap1b is required for cAMP inhibition of Akt, expression of a dominant-negative mutant such as Rap1b-S17N should block the inhibitory action of cAMP. Expression of Rap1b-S17N markedly reduced cAMP inhibition of basal Akt activity (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, like the PKA inhibitor H89, Rap1b-S17N stimulated Akt activity in the absence of added cAMP signaling agents, suggesting that Rap1b exerts a tonic inhibitory control on Akt, similar to PKA. These results demonstrate that Rap1b is both sufficient and required for cAMP inhibition of basal Akt activity. To address whether Rap1b is involved in cAMP inhibition of insulin-stimulated Akt, cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged Akt and Myc-tagged Rap1b-interfering constructs. The effect of cAMP on insulin-stimulated Akt activity was evaluated by forskolin dose-response curves. Forskolin inhibited insulin-stimulated HA-Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5A) similar to its action on endogenous Akt (Fig. 3, A and D). This effect was completely blocked by expression of the dominant-negative Rap1b-S17N (Fig. 5, B and D). Moreover, cAMP inhibition of insulin-stimulated Akt activity was potentiated by expression of the constitutively active Rap1b-G12V construct as revealed by the marked left shift on the forskolin dose-response curve (Fig.6, B and D). These results demonstrate that activation of Rap1b is necessary and sufficient for cAMP inhibition of insulin-stimulated Akt activity. If this is true, down-regulation of active Rap1b should block or significantly reduce cAMP inhibition of Akt. For this, the negative Rap1 regulator RapGAP was co-transfected with Akt into cells. Subsequently, these cells were serum-starved and stimulated with insulin in the presence of increasing concentrations of forskolin. Expression of Rap1GAP completely abolished the cAMP inhibition of Akt phosphorylation as revealed in the forskolin dose-response curves (Fig.7, B and C). Thus, the data afford the conclusion that cAMP activation of Rap1b mediates the cAMP inhibition of Akt.Figure 6Phosphorylation-deficient but constitutively active Rap1b does not inhibit Akt.Forskolin dose responses were performed as described in the legends to Figs. 3 and 5, on cells co-transfected with HA-Akt and Myc-vector (A), Myc-Rap1b-G12V (B), or Myc-Rap1b-G12V-S179A (C). Akt phosphorylation was analyzed as described, after immunoprecipitation with HA and immunoblotting with HA (HA-Akt) or anti-P-T308 (pHA-Akt). An aliquot of the lysate was blotted with Myc antibody.

Lemee N. Lou L. Altschuler D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5418-5423Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PKA activity is required for the cAMP-dependent inhibition of Akt (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus, we have explored the possibility that phospho-deficient Rap1b mutants might interfere with cAMP inhibition of Akt. Because the dominant-negative Rap1b-S17N blocks cAMP signaling into Akt, we examined whether Rap1b-S17N Ser179 phosphorylation is at all required for its dominant-negative action. This experimental maneuver reflects an indirect assessment of the interaction of Rap1b with GEFs. If phosphorylation is required for the action of Rap1b-S17N, its phospho-deficient mutant, Rap1b-S17N-S179A, should not block the interaction between endogenous Rap1 and GEF, resulting in loss of Rap1b-S17N blockade of cAMP inhibition of Akt. However, lack of Ser179 phosphorylation did not relieve the inhibitory effect of Rap1b-S17N as indicated by the inability of cAMP to inhibit Akt (Fig. 5, C and D). This result is consistent with the observation that cAMP stimulation of Rap1-GTP binding can proceed independently of PKA (29Tsygankova O.M. Saavedra A. Rebhun J.F. Quilliam L.A. Meinkoth J.L. Mol.

For this a S179A mutation was introduced in the context of the Rap1b-G12V background. This phosphorylation-deficient and constitutively active Rap1b mutant abolished cAMP inhibition of Akt (Fig. 6, C andD). Moreover, the ability of Rap1b-G12V to inhibit Akt is blocked by the PKA inhibitor H89 (not shown). These results indicate that transduction of the"
https://openalex.org/W2045502245,"Exceptionally bright quasars with redshifts up to z=6.28 have recently been discovered. Quasars are thought to be powered by the accretion of gas onto supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies. Their maximum (Eddington) luminosity is proportional to the mass of the black hole, and so these bright quasars are inferred to have black holes with masses of more than a few billion solar masses. The existence of such massive black holes poses a challenge to models for the formation of structures in the early Universe, as it requires that the black holes would grow so massive in less than a billion years after the Big Bang. Here we show that up to a third of known quasars with z~6 will have their observed flux magnified by a factor of 10 or more through gravitational lensing by galaxies along the line of sight. The inferred abundance of quasar host galaxies, as well as the luminosity density provided by the quasars, are therefore substantially overestimated."
https://openalex.org/W2116665363,"We examined the in vivo effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on Sp1 (promoter-selective transcription factor 1) DNA binding activity and studied the mechanisms involved in mouse lungs. The Sp1 DNA complex displayed a major band composed of Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 trimer and a minor band composed of Sp3 homodimer. Compared with control, nuclear proteins from lungs challenged with LPS for 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 min, respectively, showed a markedly reduced Sp1 binding activity. Down-regulation of Sp1 binding activity was accompanied by a reduced expression of two Sp1-dependent genes (endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-1). Immunoprecipitation-Western blot experiments demonstrated that LPS dephosphorylated Sp1 protein at serine and threonine residues but not at the tyrosine residue. Dephosphorylation of Sp1 protein in vitro significantly reduced Sp1 DNA binding activity. Deglycosylation of Sp1 protein also reduced Sp1 binding activity. However, LPS did not cause Sp1 deglycosylation. LPS markedly reduced nuclear Sp1 protein level but had no significant effect on Sp1 mRNA abundance and on Sp1 protein nuclear translocation. Both Sp1 protein dephosphorylation and Sp1 protein degradation are temporally correlated to the reduced Sp1 binding activity. Our results demonstrate that challenge of mice with LPS in vivo down-regulates Sp1 DNA binding activity through promoting Sp1 protein dephosphorylation and degradation. We examined the in vivo effect of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on Sp1 (promoter-selective transcription factor 1) DNA binding activity and studied the mechanisms involved in mouse lungs. The Sp1 DNA complex displayed a major band composed of Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 trimer and a minor band composed of Sp3 homodimer. Compared with control, nuclear proteins from lungs challenged with LPS for 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 min, respectively, showed a markedly reduced Sp1 binding activity. Down-regulation of Sp1 binding activity was accompanied by a reduced expression of two Sp1-dependent genes (endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-1). Immunoprecipitation-Western blot experiments demonstrated that LPS dephosphorylated Sp1 protein at serine and threonine residues but not at the tyrosine residue. Dephosphorylation of Sp1 protein in vitro significantly reduced Sp1 DNA binding activity. Deglycosylation of Sp1 protein also reduced Sp1 binding activity. However, LPS did not cause Sp1 deglycosylation. LPS markedly reduced nuclear Sp1 protein level but had no significant effect on Sp1 mRNA abundance and on Sp1 protein nuclear translocation. Both Sp1 protein dephosphorylation and Sp1 protein degradation are temporally correlated to the reduced Sp1 binding activity. Our results demonstrate that challenge of mice with LPS in vivo down-regulates Sp1 DNA binding activity through promoting Sp1 protein dephosphorylation and degradation. lipopolysaccharide O-linkedN-acetylglucosamine calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase β-N-acetylglucosaminidase electrophoretic mobility shift assay nuclear protein endothelial nitric-oxide synthase glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cyclooxygenase-1 Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 is a principle mediator of sepsis, septic shock, and other inflammatory disorders (1Manthous C.A.

Exposure of host cells to LPS triggers the release a battery of host defense molecules including cytokines, chemokines, interferons, cell adhesion molecules, lipid mediators, reactive oxygen species, and nitrogen intermediates. Although these molecules are essential to host defense against bacterial infection, excessive production of these mediators can cause circulatory collapse and organ damage, leading to septic shock syndrome, a condition that results in ∼20,000 annual deaths in the United States (2Pinner R.W.

Transcription factors are usually the final target of many signal transduction cascades that lead to gene transcription and may play important roles in the LPS signaling. Transcription factors known to mediate LPS response include NF-κB, activating protein-1, and nuclear factor interleukin-6 (18Sweet M.J. Hume D.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 8-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The roles of other transcription factors in LPS signaling remain to be studied. One transcription factor that may be a target of LPS signaling is the promoter-selective transcription factor (Sp1). The GC box-binding protein, Sp1, is a ubiquitous transcription factor that belongs to the Sp family of transcription factors, consisting of Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 (19Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Sp1 has been implicated in the transcription of large number of genes (for a complete list, check on PubMed, using key word sp1), particularly housekeeping genes, tissue-specific genes, and genes involved in growth regulation (19Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 20Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem.

Sp1 activities are regulated by a variety of stimuli. Most of these regulations occur through either post-translational modification or alteration of Sp1 protein abundance. The principal known post-translational modifications are phosphorylation and glycosylation through the O-linkage of the monosaccharide, N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) (22Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Depending on cell type and stimuli, phosphorylation of Sp1 protein can increase (23Rohlff C. Ahmad S. Borellini F.

The abundance of cellular Sp1 protein is principally regulated via proteolytic activity, although the proteases involved are quite variable with cell types and stimuli (26Mortensen E.R. Marks P.A.

On rat pituitary adenoma cells, epidermal growth factor and okadaic acid cause Sp1 degradation via a cysteine protease (26Mortensen E.R. Marks P.A. Shiotani A. Merchant J.L. J. Biol.

Kudlow J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2550-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In mouse T cells, EL-4 cells, and in human T cells, Jurkat cells, retinoid promotes Sp1, proteolysis by a mechanism that involves activation of caspase (32Piedrafita F.J. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6348-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the green monkey kidney cell line, CV-1, Sp1 protein is degraded by a cathepsin-like cysteine protease under unstimulated conditions (33Nishinaka T., Fu, Y.H. Chen L.I. Yokoyama K. Chiu R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although we have previously reported that challenge of rat with LPS down-regulates Sp1-DNA binding activity in the lungs (34Ye X. Liu S.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the mechanisms regulating Sp1 activity during sepsis and the biological significance of this down-regulation remain to be elucidated. The composition of the Sp1-DNA binding complex under in vivoconditions has not been determined. Additionally, it is not known whether this down-regulation is a universal phenomenon. In this study, we have characterized the time course profile of LPS-induced down-regulation of Sp1 binding activity in the mouse lungs, determined the composition of the Sp1-DNA binding complex, elucidated the mechanisms mediating the LPS-induced down-regulation of Sp1 binding activity, and studied the biological significance of this down-regulation. Our data demonstrated that LPS down-regulates Sp1 activity through promoting Sp1 protein dephosphorylation and degradation. Adult FVB mice (25–30 g, body weight) were used in all studies. The institutional Animal Care Committee has proven all the animal protocols. Mice in control and LPS groups were injected with saline (1 ml/kg, intraperitoneally) or Salmonella enteritidis lipopolysaccharide (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), respectively. At 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 min after LPS injection, animals were killed by exsanguination. Lungs were removed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and used for extracting cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted from mouse lungs as previously described (35Liu S.F., Ye, X. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3976-3983PubMed Google Scholar). Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide probe (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCCAG-3′) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear protein (10 μg) was incubated with 50,000 cpm 32P-labeled Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide for 30 min in binding buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Biosciences). The specificity of the Sp1 DNA binding was determined in competition reactions in which a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled Sp1 oligonucleotide was added to the binding reaction 10 min prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. In the supershift assay, antibody (1 μg) reactive to mouse Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4 protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the reaction mixture immediately after the addition of radiolabeled Sp1 probe. Reaction was subjected to nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel was vacuum-dried and exposed to x-ray film. Nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were extracted from lungs of control mice and mice challenged with LPS for 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min, respectively. Equal amounts of cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins (20 μg/lane) were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions. Proteins were electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After incubation in blocking solution (5% dry milk in TBST) at room temperature for 2 h, the membrane was incubated with primary antibodies (Sp1 etc.) at room temperature for 1 h. The membrane was washed and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h. Peroxidase labeling was detected using the ECL Western blotting detection system (AmershamBiosciences). The rat cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) (308 bp), GAPDH (309 bp), and mouse Sp1 (461 bp) cDNA probes were generated using reverse transcriptase-PCR using primers corresponding to published rat COX-1 (36Feng L.

Sabrouty S.E. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar) and mouse Sp1 (GenBankTM accession number NM-013672) cDNA sequences. Authenticities of PCR product were confirmed by dideoxy chain termination sequencing. The endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) probe was full-length bovine eNOS cDNA probe (38Lamas S. Marsden P.A., Li, G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Total and poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated as previously described (35Liu S.F., Ye, X. Malik A.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3976-3983PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty μg of total RNA or 2 μg of mRNA from each sample was separated on a 1.2% denaturing agarose gel and transferred onto Biodyne nylon membrane (Pall Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI). The membrane was incubated at 42 °C for at least 4 h in ULTRAhyb buffer (Ambion, Austin, TX). Membrane was hybridized with 0.5–2 × 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled probes at 42 °C for 12–14 h. Blots were washed sequentially at decreasing concentrations of SSC plus 0.1% SDS and increasing temperature (final wash, 0.1× SSC plus 0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 30 min) and exposed to x-ray film. Nuclear protein (10 μg) from control lungs was incubated with 5 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP; New England Biolabs) for 0.5 h at 37 °C in dephosphorylation buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 34 mm KCl, 50 mm MgCl2). The reaction was stopped by the addition of a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors to a final concentration of 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mmpotassium pyrophosphate, and 5 mm sodium phosphate. The dephosphorylated nuclear protein (NP) was used for EMSA. We carried out three groups of reactions: control, NP alone; CIP, NP, buffer, and CIP; and mock, NP plus dephosphorylation buffer without CIP. To verify that treatment of control nuclear proteins with CIP dephosphorylates Sp1 protein, 150 μg of control and CIP- and mock-treated NP was immunoprecipitated with Sp1 antibody and subjected to Western blot using antibody against phosphoserine and Sp1. Nuclear protein (10 μg) from control lungs was incubated with 0.1 units of β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG; Sigma) in reaction buffer (50 mm citric acid, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.01% bovine serum albumin, pH 5) at 25 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 600 mmborate buffer. The deglycosylated nuclear proteins were used for EMSA. We carried out three groups of reactions: control (NP alone); NAG, NP, buffer, and NAG (0.1 units); and mock (NP plus deglycosylation buffer without NAG). To verify that treatment of control nuclear proteins with NAG deglycosylates Sp1 protein, 150 μg of control and NAG- and mock-treated NP was immunoprecipitated with Sp1 antibody and subjected to Western blot using antibody against O-linked acetylglucosamine and Sp1. Nuclear proteins (350 μg) from control lungs and lungs challenged with LPS for 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min, respectively, were immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of Sp1 antibody and 20 μl of protein G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) in binding buffer overnight at 4 °C. The Sp1-antibody-protein G complexes were centrifuged at 1000 ×g, and the pellets were washed five times with binding buffer. The immunoprecipitation-Sp1 protein was resuspended in Western blot sample buffer, boiled, electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The immunoblots were developed with antibodies against phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine (Zymed Laboratories), orO-linked acetylglucosamine (Affinity BioReagents). Bands on EMSA and Northern blot autoradiogram film were quantitated using a RS700 densitometer linked to a computer analysis system (Bio-Rad). The relative eNOS, COX-1, and Sp1 mRNA levels were normalized by their corresponding GAPDH bands. Statistical analysis of multiple comparison data was performed by one-way analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis Rank test. Comparison between two groups was analyzed using t test or the Mann-Whitney U test. We have previously reported that LPS challenge in vivodown-regulated Sp1 DNA binding activity in rat lungs (34Ye X. Liu S.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To verify whether this is a universal phenomenon, we now characterize the LPS-induced down-regulation of Sp1 binding activity in the mouse lungs. We examine the time course profile of this down-regulation in more detail. Nuclear proteins were extracted from control lungs and lungs challenged with LPS for 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 min, respectively, and were tested for their ability to bind to Sp1 oligonucleotide probes in EMSA. Competition study showed that the Sp1-DNA binding complex was virtually completely displaced in the presence of a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled Sp1 oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 1A, lane 3). In contrast, a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotide probe had no effect on the Sp1-DNA binding complex (Fig. 1A, lane 4), indicating the specificity of Sp1 DNA binding. There were two bands in the Sp1-DNA complex. The major band was supershifted by Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 antibodies either individually or in combination, indicating that it is composed of Sp1, Sp2, and Sp3 trimer (Fig. 1B). However, Sp2 appears to constitute only a small portion of the major band, since a combination of Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies caused a significantly greater supershift than that caused by the combination of Sp1 and Sp2 antibodies (Fig. 1B). The minor band was supershifted by Sp3 antibody only, indicating that it is composed of Sp3/Sp3 homodimer (Fig. 1B). Sp4 antibody did not supershift either band. The Sp1 DNA binding activity was strong in nuclear proteins from control lungs but was markedly reduced in nuclear proteins from lungs challenged with LPS for 60, 120, and 240 min (Fig.2A). We quantified the Sp1 band intensity using densitometry and expressed as arbitrary optical density units. Compared with controls, LPS caused a 79, 91, and 54% reduction in Sp1 band intensity at 60, 120, and 240 min post-LPS (Fig.2B). To obtain a more detailed time course profile of this Sp1 down-regulation, we examined Sp1 DNA binding activity in nuclear protein from lungs challenged with LPS for 90, 150, and 180 min, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 2C, the Sp1 band intensity at 90 and 150 min post-LPS was similar to that at 120 min post-LPS (Fig. 2A, lane 7). The band intensity increased slightly at 180 min post-LPS but was still less intense compared with that at 240 min (Fig. 2A, lane 8, versus Fig. 2C, lane 4). Thus, challenge of mice with LPSin vivo down-regulated Sp1 DNA binding activity in the lungs. This down-regulation was seen at 60 min, maximized at 120–150 min, and gradually recovered from 180 min onward.FIG. 2Time course of LPS-induced down-regulation of Sp1 binding activity in mouse lungs. Mice were challenged with LPS (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) for the periods of time indicated. Nuclear protein was extracted from lungs of control (Con) and lungs challenged with LPS and was subjected to EMSA.

C, autoradiogram of EMSA showing the effects of LPS challenge for 90, 150, and 180 min, respectively, on Sp1 binding activity in the lungs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the biological significance of the LPS-induced down-regulation of Sp1 activity, we examined the effect of LPS on the gene expressions of eNOS and COX-1, two of the most important Sp1-dependent genes (39Cieslik K. Zembowicz A. Tang J.L. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14885-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 40Xu X.M. Tang J.L. Chen X. Wang L.H. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6943-6950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), in rat lungs challenged with LPS for 4 h. This is the time point 2 h after the maximum reduction in Sp1 DNA binding activity was observed. Due to the small size, it was impossible to perform EMSA, Western blot, and Northern blot on the same mouse lung. To see a better correlation between Sp1 activity and eNOS or COX-1 gene expression, we carried out Northern blot using rat lungs challenged with LPS for 4 h. We have previously showed a down-regulated Sp1 activity in these lungs (34Ye X. Liu S.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Using eNOS- and COX-1-specific probes, we detected a single eNOS band of ∼4.3 kb and a single COX-1 band of ∼2.8 kb in RNA from control lungs (Fig. 3). Both eNOS and COX-1 mRNA band intensity was greatly reduced in RNA from lungs challenged with LPS for 4 h (Fig. 3). Thus, down-regulation of Sp1 binding activity by LPS is accompanied by and correlated to a down-regulation of the expression of Sp1-dependent genes. We next examined the mechanism of LPS-induced down-regulation of Sp1 binding activity. We first want to know whether LPS causes Sp1 protein phosphorylation or dephosphorylation and, if so, which residue is phosphorylated or dephosphorylated. We immunoprecipitated Sp1 protein from nuclear extract of control lungs and lungs challenged with LPS for 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min, respectively. The immunoprecipitation-Sp1 proteins were immunoblotted to antibodies against phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. As illustrated in Fig.4, anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies detected a strong band, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody detected no band on control Sp1 protein, indicating that Sp1 protein is phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues but not at tyrosine residue under normal physiological conditions. LPS reduced the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine band intensity in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody detected a light band on Sp1 proteins from lungs challenged with LPS for 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively (Fig. 4). This phosphotyrosine band became undetectable on Sp1 protein from lungs challenged with LPS for 240 min, when the phosphoserine and phosphothreonine bands reappeared (Fig. 4). These results indicate that LPS caused Sp1 protein dephosphorylation at serine and threonine residues and Sp1 protein phosphorylation at tyrosine residue. At 120 min post-LPS, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine bands became virtually undetectable (Fig. 4), suggesting complete dephosphorylation. This pattern of changes in Sp1 phosphorylation state was temporally correlated to the pattern of changes in LPS-induced reduction of Sp1 DNA binding activity (Figs. 2and 4). To establish a link between LPS-induced Sp1 protein dephosphorylation and reduced Sp1 binding activity, we incubated nuclear proteins from control lungs with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase to dephosphorylate Sp1 protein and tested the ability of the dephosphorylated proteins to bind to Sp1-specific oligonucleotide probe. Compared with control, dephosphorylated nuclear proteins showed a dramatically reduced Sp1 DNA binding activity (Fig.5A, CIP). By contrast, mock dephosphorylation had no effect on Sp1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 5A). The reduced Sp1 DNA binding activity seen in CIP-treated nuclear protein (Fig. 5A, CIP) was not a result of reduced Sp1 protein level (Fig.5B, CIP) but rather a result of Sp1 protein dephosphorylation (Fig. 5B, CIP). These results established a link between Sp1 protein dephosphorylation and the reduced Sp1 DNA binding activity. To test whether change in Sp1 protein glycosylation state also affects Sp1 binding activity, the O-linkedN-acetylglucosamine was removed from control Sp1 protein by incubating nuclear proteins from control lungs with NAG. The deglycosylated nuclear protein was tested for its ability to bind to Sp1-specific oligonucleotide probe. The mock deglycosylation reaction contained all of the components without NAG. Mock deglycosylation of nuclear protein moderately reduced Sp1 binding activity, suggesting that deglycosylation buffer interferes with the Sp1 DNA binding reaction (Fig. 6A). However, deglycosylation of nuclear protein caused an over 80% reduction in Sp1 DNA binding activity (Fig. 6A, NAG). NAG treatment had no effect on Sp1 protein level (Fig. 6B, NAG) but caused Sp1 protein deglycosylation (Fig.6B, NAG), indicating that NAG treatment reduces Sp1 DNA binding activity by causing Sp1 protein deglycosylation. Sp1 is a glycoprotein and is known to undergo glycosylation or deglycosylation under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We determined the effect of LPS on Sp1 glycosylation and linked the"

The molecular determinants that dictate plasma membrane expression of RFC as well as the cellular mechanisms that deliver RFC to the cell surface remain poorly defined. Therefore, we designed a series of fusion proteins of the human RFC (hRFC) with green fluorescent protein to image the targeting and trafficking dynamics of hRFC in living epithelial cells. We show that, in contrast to many other nutrient transporters, the molecular determinants that dictate hRFC plasma membrane expression reside within the hydrophobic backbone of the polypeptide and not within the cytoplasmic NH2- or COOH-terminal domains of the protein. Further, the integrity of the hRFC backbone is critical for export of the polypeptide from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. This trafficking is critically dependent on intact microtubules because microtubule disruption inhibits motility of hRFC-containing vesicles as well as final expression of hRFC in the plasma membrane. For the first time, these data define the mechanisms that control the intracellular trafficking and cell surface localization of hRFC within mammalian epithelia.

Deficiency of this essential micronutrient leads to a variety of abnormalities including derangement of one-carbon metabolism and inhibition of growth. Humans and other mammals do not possess the ability to synthesize folate and must obtain this vitamin from exogenous sources by intestinal absorption. Absorption occurs from both dietary sources in the small intestine and from bacterially synthesized folate in the large intestine (3Said H.M. Kumar C. Curr. Concepts Gastroenterol. 1999; 15: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 4Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thereafter, folate is distributed into different body compartments where it is taken up by individual cell types for use in different metabolic reactions. Many previous studies have shown that the main folate uptake pathway in cells occurs via a specialized carrier-mediated mechanism, the reduced folate carrier (RFC1; in humans, known as hRFC) (4Sirotnak F.M. Tolner B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 5Said H.M. Rose R. Seetharam B. Barritt K.E. Donowitz M. Gastrointestinal Transport Molecular Physiology.

The RFC is also involved in intestinal absorption of folate from the small and large intestine (5Said H.M. Rose R. Seetharam B. Barritt K.E. Donowitz M. Gastrointestinal Transport Molecular Physiology. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 35-75Google Scholar). The functional properties of this transport pathway have been well characterized (4Sirotnak F.M.

Nutr. 1999; 19: 91-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In contrast, comparatively little is known about the mechanisms that control the intracellular trafficking of the RFC protein and its appropriate expression in the plasma membrane, topics of particular importance for transport of folate by mammalian epithelial cells. Genetic defects in such folate transport processes have been reported previously; however, little is known about the exact sites of these defects (10Geller J. Kronn D. Jayabose S. Sandoval C. Medicine (Baltimore). 2002; 81: 516-568Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). To address these questions, we used high resolution confocal imaging techniques to monitor the distribution and transport of hRFC fusion proteins tagged with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in living mammalian epithelial cell lines. By comparing the expression patterns of nine truncated hRFC mutants, we show that targeting of hRFC to the plasma membrane depends on the integrity of the membrane-spanning “backbone” of the protein, rather than on targeting sequences in the NH2- or COOH-terminal cytoplasmic regions. Furthermore, by using video-rate confocal microscopy, we resolved the intracellular trafficking dynamics of hRFC-containing vesicles and demonstrate that delivery of hRFC-EGFP to the cell surface is critically dependent on intact microtubules but not microfilaments. Taken together, these results highlight how the hRFC polypeptide sequence is targeted and delivered to the cell surface within a physiologically relevant context, and they define the regions of the hRFC protein in which mutations would impair folate transport by disrupting trafficking and targeting mechanisms. FM4-64 was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Green (EGFP-N3) and yellow (EYFP-membrane) fluorescent protein vectors were from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA). Cytochalasin D, nocodazole, colchicine, and γ-lumicolchicine were from Calbiochem. Tissue culture cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma or from suppliers outlined previously (11Subramanian V.S. Marchant J.S. Parker I. Said H.M. Am. J.

Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding the open reading frame of the full-length hRFC and various truncated constructs (Fig. 1) were generated by PCR using the primer sequences and combinations shown in Table I. PCRs were carried out as described previously (11Subramanian V.S. Marchant J.S. Parker I. Said H.M. Am. J.

This method generated in-frame fusion proteins under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells, human duodenal derived intestinal epithelial (HuTu-80) cells, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were maintained in minimum Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (20% fetal bovine serum) and human colonic (NCM 460) cells in Ham’s F-12 medium (20% fetal bovine serum). All media contained glutamine, sodium bicarbonate, penicillin, and streptomycin. For transient transfection, cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated cover slips cemented in holes at the bottom of sterile Petri dishes (MatTek, MA) and were transfected at ∼90% confluence with plasmid DNA complexes using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). For all transfection protocols, conditions were optimized to minimize the amount of DNA used (typically ∼0.6 μg of cDNA of the indicated construct and less than recommended by the manufacturers) to minimize any nonspecific effects of fusion protein overexpression. Monolayers were subsequently imaged using confocal microscopy at indicated times after transfection (typically ∼48 h). Cell monolayers were monitored for hRFC-EGFP expression using a custom built laser scanning confocal microscope (12Parker I. Callamaras N. Wier W.G. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or a video-rate scanning confocal microscope (13Callamaras N. Parker I. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Both instruments were based on Olympus IX70 inverted microscopes fitted with 40×, NA 1.35 oil immersion objectives. EGFP, EYFP, DsRed, and FM4-64 were all excited using the 488 nm line from an argon ion laser, and emitted fluorescence was monitored using a 530 ± 20 nm band pass filter (EGFP, EYFP) or 650LP filter (DsRed, FM4-64). For slow frame scanning, confocal images were obtained by scanning either laterally (top view; x-y scans) or axially (side view;x-z scans) across the specimen. For video-rate imaging experiments, images were recorded at 30 Hz (one frame every 33 ms) from confocal sections with the microscope focused about 2 μm above the coverglass within cells maintained at 22 or 37 °C. Data were digitized using the stream acquisition function of the Metamorph processing package (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, PA). The resulting image stacks (x-y time) were then smoothed using a two-frame average to yield a final image stack at 66-ms frame intervals. The motions of individual vesicles were tracked using the point-to-point tracking function in Metamorph, and the resulting paths were exported to the Origin graphing package for analysis. QuickTime videos of image sequences are appended as supplementary material. HEK-293 cells were used for these experiments because their high (∼40%) efficiency of transfection allowed counting of large cell populations (15,000 cells for each construct, three experiments). Monolayers of HEK-293 cells were transfected in situ within individual T75 tissue culture flasks using ∼4 μg of cDNA encoding individual constructs. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, and populations of >15,000 transfected cells were measured for intensity of fluorescence emission (488 nm excitation, 530 ± 15 nm emission) using a FACStation fluorescence analysis system (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems). To visualize the targeting of hRFC in mammalian cells, we transiently transfected a variety of epithelial cell lines with cDNA encoding the full-length fusion construct (hRFC-EGFP) and analyzed the resulting fluorescence distribution by confocal microscopy. In HuTu-80 cells (human duodenal epithelium), hRFC-EGFP expression was evident at the cell surface and in cellular processes extending from the cell membrane as well in a population of discrete, intracellular vesicular structures (Fig.2A, see also later). This distribution of fluorescence contrasted markedly with HuTu-80 cells expressing EGFP alone, in which the entire cytosolic volume was fluorescent (Fig. 2B). These contrasting distributions were also evident in axial (x-z) sections of cells expressing hRFC-EGFP (Fig. 2C) or EGFP alone (Fig. 2D), which suggested that hRFC-EGFP was targeted to all plasma membrane domains of the cell. The localization of hRFC-EGFP to the plasma membrane was not unique to HuTu-80 cells because a similar targeting was evident from lateral (x-y) sections images in a variety of other mammalian epithelial cell lines including HEK-293, Caco-2, Madin-Darby canine kidney, and NCM-460 cells (Fig. 2E). To determine the domains within the hRFC protein which are important for its correct trafficking and targeting we compared the cellular distribution seen with the full-length hRFC-EGFP with that observed with the series of hRFC mutants diagrammed in Fig.1. Fig. 3 shows representative lateral confocal images of HuTu-80 cells transiently transfected with each of the indicated constructs and imaged 48 h later when the full-length hRFC-EGFP was almost completely distributed to the plasma membrane (see below). It is apparent that changes in the sequence of hRFC resulted in a wide variety of cellular distributions. Four classes of distribution were evident: 1) expression primarily at the cell surface (hRFC[1–530]-EGFP, hRFC[1–452]-EGFP, and hRFC[19–466]-EGFP, Fig. 3A); 2) cytosolic, non-membrane-bound expression (hRFC[452–591]-EGFP and hRFC[1–27]-EGFP, Fig. 3B); 3) expression confined within intracellular membranes (hRFC[1–301]-EGFP and hRFC[1–144]-EGFP, Fig. 3C); 4) a heterogeneous distribution, spanning several of the above categories (hRFC[28–591]-EGFP and hRFC[302–452]-EGFP, Fig. 3D). Expression of hRFC[28–591]-EGFP was evident at the cell surface as well as throughout the intracellular compartments, whereas hRFC[302–452]-EGFP was restricted to intracellular membranes soon after transfection and thereafter appeared in the cytoplasm. This latter profile is suggestive of a poorly tolerated protein structure that is actively targeted for degradation (14Sadlish H. Murray R.C. Williams F.M.R. Flintoff W.F. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 509-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To quantify the relative amounts of hRFC protein expressed in the plasma membrane versus that in other cellular compartments, we imaged transfected cells that were costained by extracellular application of the red emitting lipophilic dye FM4-64 (15Janecki A.J. Janecki M. Akhter S. Donowitz M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 1479-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This selectively labels the plasma membrane, thereby allowing us to estimate the extent of localization of hRFC-EGFP at the cell surface by measuring the degree of overlap of red and green fluorescence. Examples are shown in Fig. 3E for cells expressing hRFC-EGFP at the cell surface (high degree of overlap with FM4-64: yellowcolor) and cells expressing a construct (hRFC[1–301]-EGFP) that remained localized to intracellular membranes (little fluorescence colocalization). Fig. 3F shows measurements of fluorescence colocalization obtained in this way for the various constructs. A high degree (>50%) of colocalization was seen in cells expressing hRFC-EGFP, hRFC[1–530]-EGFP, hRFC[1–452]-EGFP, and hRFC[19–466]-EGFP, confirming that these four constructs targeted efficiently to the cell surface. Little colocalization (∼8–14%, equivalent to that (∼10%) with EGFP alone) was seen with hRFC[1–301]-EGFP, hRFC[1–144]-EGFP, hRFC[1–27]-EGFP, hRFC[452–591]-EGFP, and hRFC[302–452]-EGFP, confirming their inability to target to the cell surface. An intermediate degree of colocalization (∼ 28%) was seen with hRFC[28–591]-EGFP, suggesting that a small proportion of the expressed construct was delivered to the cell surface. In addition to the differing cellular localization of hRFC-EGFP proteins expressed by the different constructs, it was also apparent that the total amount of protein expressed varied greatly among constructs. For example, although hRFC-EGFP and hRFC[1–452]-EGFP were both expressed selectively at the cell surface, cells expressing the latter construct were much dimmer (at equivalent laser power) than hRFC-EGFP-transfected cells. Given identical transfection conditions (0.6 μg of DNA, imaged after 48 h) and promoter expression, this variability presumably reflects differences in cellular processing for each construct (e.g. relative rates of protein synthesis and degradation). To quantify these differences, we used flow cytometry to measure the distributions of total fluorescence of cells transfected with constructs that showed predominant targeting to the plasma membrane (hRFC-EGFP, hRFC[1–530]-EGFP, hRFC[1–452]-EGFP, hRFC[19–466]-EGFP) or to intracellular membranes (hRFC[1–301]-EGFP and hRFC[1–144]-EGFP). HEK-293 cells were used for these experiments because their high transfection efficiency permitted measurements from large (>15,000) populations of cells. We note however, that the subcellular distribution of each hRFC construct was identical in both HEK-293 and HuTu-80 cell lines (Fig.2C and data not shown). Fig. 4 shows that although the level of protein expression was not reduced appreciably by either partial truncation of the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail (mean fluorescence of the hRFC[1–530]-EGFP population 102 ± 3% of that of hRFC-EGFP, three independent runs) or by partial truncation of both the COOH-terminal and NH2-terminal regions (hRFC[19–466]-EGFP, 84 ± 14%), complete truncation of the COOH-terminal hRFC-EGFP sequence substantially decreased the level of expression (hRFC[1–452]-EGFP, 42.7 ± 3%). Further truncations into the hRFC backbone reduced expression further (hRFC[1–301]-EGFP, 27.4 ± 3% and hRFC[1–144]-EGFP, 17.5 ± 3%). Taken together, the data of Figs. 3 and 4 show that the hRFC structure dictates the subcellular targeting as well as the efficiency of protein expression within mammalian cells. In contrast to other membrane transporters (16Achler C. Filmer D. Mertre C. Drenckhahn D. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 17Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F425-F429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F192-F201Crossref Google Scholar), little is known about the cytoskeletal mechanisms that direct the intracellular trafficking of hRFC (11Subramanian V.S. Marchant J.S. Parker I. Said H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1477-G1486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To resolve this issue, we examined the possible roles of microfilaments and microtubules in transporting hRFC-EGFP to the cell surface by using pharmacological methods to disrupt the cytoskeleton selectively. To identify an appropriate time window for pharmacological intervention, we began by characterizing the kinetics of hRFC-EGFP expression after transfection. Fluorescence was initially apparent after 4 h as a weak juxtanuclear signal. Subsequently, the fluorescence increased, spread throughout the cell, and became increasingly localized to the plasma membrane (Fig.5A). The relative extent of hRFC-EGFP expression at the cell surface was estimated by costaining with FM4-64, as before. At early times after transfection (∼ 4–5 h) there was little colocalization between hRFC-EGFP distribution and FM4-64 staining (12.1 ± 2.5%, Fig. 5, B left and C), and this value was similar to that with EGFP alone (16.7 ± 6%; Fig. 5C). However, by 36 h colocalization between hRFC-EGFP and FM4-64 had increased to a maximal value (63.5 ± 6%, Fig. 5, B right and C) as a result of trafficking of hRFC-EGFP to the cell surface, whereas colocalization in cells transfected with EGFP alone (9.1 ± 6%) or hRFC[1–304]-EGFP (13.8 ± 9%, ≥15 cells) failed to show any further increase (Fig. 5C). As shown in Fig. 5C, hRFC-EGFP fluorescence at the cell surface began to increase rapidly about 12 h after transfection, and we thus selected this as a suitable time point at which to apply cytoskeletal disrupting drugs, either cytochalasin D, a microfilament disrupting agent, or nocodazole, a microtubule-disrupting agent. Both drugs were added to the incubation medium at final concentrations (400 nm) that are sufficient to disrupt cytoskeletal architecture but minimize toxicity during the prolonged (8 h) application (11Subramanian V.S. Marchant J.S. Parker I. Said H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1477-G1486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Grigoriev I.S. Chernobelskaya A.A. Vorobjev I.A. Membr. Cell Biol. 1999; 13: 23-48PubMed Google Scholar). Colocalization of FM4-64 and hRFC-EGFP fluorescence was then assessed 8 h later (i.e. 20 h after transfection). Measurements are shown in Fig. 5D, expressed as the change in colocalization relative to that measured at 12 h to reflect trafficking of hRFC-EGFP to the plasma membrane during the time the drugs were present. Although colocalization of fluorescence between hRFC-EGFP and FM4-64 increased to a similar extent in untreated cells (2.2 ± 0.4-fold, n = 12 cells) and cells treated with cytochalasin D (2.0 ± 0.3-fold,n = 21 cells), a slight decrease was seen after incubation with nocodazole (0.91 ± 0.42-fold, n = 39 cells). Thus, disruption of the microtubular cytoskeleton almost completely inhibited hRFC-EGFP trafficking to the plasma membrane, whereas disruption of the actin cytoskeleton was without effect. Confocal images of hRFC-EGFP distribution in HuTu-80 cells revealed numerous intracellular vesicular-like structures (Figs. 2A and6A). To measure the dynamics of these structures and further investigate the role of cytoskeletal elements in hRFC transport, we employed video-rate confocal imaging to capture image sequences with sufficient temporal resolution to track movements of individual vesicles. Experiments were performed at both 37 °C (Fig. 6A) and 22 °C (Fig. 6B), and results under both conditions are displayed in Fig. 6 as well as in the supplemental video material (Videos 1 and 2). Fig. 6A shows a single frame from a video collected at 37 °C (left) and illustrates the method used to track the motion of hRFC-EGFP-containing structures (right). The coordinates of discrete fluorescent structures were tracked at 66-ms intervals (two-frame averages) to generate color-coded tracks representing movements of several vesicles throughout the imaging period (Fig. 6A, right). Fig. 6B shows similar processing applied to a cell maintained at 22 °C from which several tracks have been expanded to illustrate generalized aspects of hRFC-EGFP dynamics. Four general features were evident from cells incubated at both temperatures. First, hRFC-EGFP was localized within structures of varied size and shape (diameters ∼0.3–1.6 μm), including spherical as well as tubular-like vesicles (Videos 1 and 2). Second, there was a wide variability in the dynamics of hRFC-containing vesicles. Some showed little motion (e.g. vesicle a, Fig.6B), whereas others remained highly dynamic over the entire imaging period or displayed interspersed periods of relatively static and dynamic behavior (e.g. vesicle b, Fig.6B). Third, the motion of dynamic vesicles was strikingly multidirectional rather than showing unidirectional progression toward the plasma membrane. Vesicles frequently retraced their paths, moved toward and away from the cell surface (e.g. vesicled, Fig. 6B) or tracked circumferentially beneath the plasma membrane (e.g. vesicle c, Fig.6B). Finally, vesicles located within the same portion of the cell often showed significant overlap in their tracks (examples in Fig. 6, A–C). The high temporal resolution of these video-rate confocal images revealed two discrete components to the observed vesicular dynamics, namely, periods of rapid, approximately linear motion (e.g.regions marked by black lines for vesicle b, Fig.6B), interspersed with lengthy periods of relative immobility during which vesicles displayed Brownian-like movements constrained within a small area (Fig. 6B). These alternating patterns of motion were apparent at both temperatures, but at 22 °C the dwell time of vesicles in the stationary state became longer, and their velocities during linear motions were slower (Fig.6C). Further reduction in temperature to 4 °C almost completely inhibited motility (data not shown). To quantitate the effect of temperature better, we measured the velocities of vesicles during periods of rapid, directed linear transport. Measurements at 37 °C from 79 vesicles (15 cells) showed linear movement over a mean distance (run length) of 3.16 ± 0.16 μm at a velocity of 1.56 ± 0.22 μm s−1 compared with an average velocity of 0.66 ± 0.07 μm s−1over a linear distance of 2.99 ± 0.42 μm at 22 °C (Fig.6D). Further, the dwell time at rest was 70.4 ± 3.6% at 22 °C, decreasing to 49.8 ± 5.1% at 37 °C (125 vesicles, ≥9 cells, Fig. 6D). Having determined these parameters under control conditions, we proceeded to examine the effect of cytoskeletal disruption on vesicle motion. Video data were recorded before and after addition of the microtubule disrupting drugs nocodazole (10 μm) or colchicine (10 μm), with γ-lumicolchicine (100 μm) as a negative control, and the actin-disrupting agent cytochalasin D (10 μm). Videos were taken at 5-min intervals after drug addition, and vesicular dynamics during linear motions were analyzed as above. Observation of cells for up to 30 min (30-s imaging periods every 5 min) showed that exposure to the laser scan had little deleterious effect on vesicular dynamics (average velocities at the start and end of the 30 min recording were 1.82 ± 0.4 μm s−1versus 1.65 ± 0.4 μm s−1, respectively; ≥8 cells, Fig.7A). In contrast, incubation of cells with 10 μm nocodazole inhibited the linear motion of vesicles within 5 min (n = 15 cells, Fig. 7,A and B). Colchicine had a similar effect, albeit over a slower time course. After a 5-min incubation in 10 μm colchicine, the linear motion of vesicles had decreased to 0.66 ± 0.07 μm/s (from 11 cells), and by 20 min motion was inhibited (Fig. 7A). γ-Lumicolchicine, even at concentrations as high as 100 μm for 30 min, failed to inhibit vesicular motility (linear velocity of 1.69 ± 0.23 μm/s, Fig. 7A). Similarly, the actin-destabilizing drug cytochalasin D was without effect on the velocity (1.47 ± 0.22 μm/s; 15 cells) of linear vesicular movement (Fig. 7, Aand C). Representative tracks from cells treated with nocodazole and cytochalasin D are shown, respectively, in Fig. 7,B and C, and the videos from which they are derived are available as supplemental material (Videos 3 and 4). In this study, we employed confocal imaging methods to answer three questions regarding the cell biology of hRFC. Where is the full-length hRFC-EGFP fusion protein localized in mammalian epithelial cells? How does the sequence of the hRFC protein control its cellular targeting? What cellular mechanism(s) underlie the trafficking of hRFC to the cell membrane? Our results in each of these areas are discussed separately below. Ligation of the green fluorescent protein to the COOH terminus of the full-length hRFC sequence generates a functional fusion protein (11Subramanian V.S. Marchant J.S. Parker I. Said H.M. Am. J.

This complex appears to play a role in irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle in differentiating keratinocytes. We now report that keratinocyte differentiation is also accompanied by changes in E2F-5 subcellular localization, from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. To define the molecular determinants of E2F-5 nuclear import, we tested its ability to enter the nucleus in import assays in vitro using digitonin-permeabilized cells. We found that E2F-5 enters the nucleus through mediated transport processes that involve formation of nuclear pore complexes. It has been proposed that E2F-4 and E2F-5, which lack defined nuclear localization signal (NLS) consensus sequences, enter the nucleus in association with NLS-containing DP-2 or pRB family proteins. However, we show that nuclear import of E2F-5 only requires the first N-terminal 56 amino acid residues and is not dependent on interaction with DP or pRB family proteins. Because E2F-5 is predominantly cytoplasmic in undifferentiated keratinocytes and in other intact cells, we also examined whether this protein is subjected to active nuclear export. Indeed, E2F-5 is exported from the nucleus through leptomycin B-sensitive, CRM1-mediated transport, through a region corresponding to amino acid residues 130–154. This region excludes the DNA- and the p130-binding domains. Thus, the subcellular distribution of E2F-5 is tightly regulated in intact cells, through multiple functional domains that direct nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of this protein.

E2F factors play a central role in controlling the G → S transition, by regulating transcription of DNA replication enzymes (4Kalma Y. Marash L. Lamed Y. Ginsberg D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1379-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and cell cycle regulators such as cyclins E and A (reviewed in Refs. 2Nevins J.R. Human Mol.

The transcriptional activity of E2F is modulated, in turn, at various levels. One of the most extensively studied mechanisms of regulation involves inhibition of E2F activity through association with pRB1 family proteins (pRB, p107, and p130; reviewed in Ref. 6Classon M. Dyson N. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In particular, formation of E2F·p130 complexes appears to be very important in the permanent cell cycle withdrawal characteristic of terminal differentiation. Recently, it has become apparent that other post-translational mechanisms participate in the control of E2F activity, including phosphorylation (7Peeper D.S. Keblusek P. Helin K.

In contrast to E2F-1, -2, and -3, which have a consensus NLS and are constitutively nuclear in most cells examined (15Lindeman G.J. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 19Magae J., Wu, C.L. Illenye S. Harlow E. Heintz N.H. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1717-1726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), E2F-4 shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and the relative proportion in each cellular compartment is, at least partially, cell cycle-dependent. Specifically, E2F-4 is predominantly nuclear in quiescent fibroblasts, and moves into the cytoplasm shortly after these cells are stimulated with serum, and as they approach the S phase (15Lindeman G.J. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that nuclear E2F-4 mediates transcriptional repression of growth-promoting genes in fibroblasts. In a variety of cell lines, exogenously expressed E2F-4 and E2F-5 are cytoplasmic, but they can be forced to translocate to the nucleus by coexpression of nuclear DP-2 or pRB family proteins. These observations, together with the lack of apparent nuclear localization signals, has led to the proposal that E2F-4 and E2F-5 reach the nucleus mainly by association with nuclear partners such as DP-2 or pRB family proteins (15Lindeman G.J.

To date, the subcellular localization of E2F factors has been examined largely in the context of cell cycle progression in fibroblasts or tumorigenic cell lines rather than during irreversible cell cycle arrest associated with terminal differentiation. The latter situation is especially relevant to tissues such as the epidermis, which are constituted by both undifferentiated keratinocytes capable of proliferating, and their terminally differentiated progeny (20Zinkel S. Fuchs E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 77-90PubMed Google Scholar,21Fuchs E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 1028-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Primary epidermal keratinocytes can be isolated and cultured under conditions that maintain an undifferentiated population. These cells differentiate by culture in medium with extracellular calcium levels > 0.05 mm, to mimic the morphological changes, induction of differentiation markers and irreversible entry into quiescence observed in mature epidermal keratinocytes in situ (22Dotto G.P. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Yuspa S.H. Hennings H. Tucker R.W. Jaken S. Kilkenny A.E. Roop D.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 548: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have shown that E2F factors are differentially regulated in the epidermis, with E2F-2 and E2F-5 mRNA expression localized, respectively, to undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes (24Lindeman G.J. Dagnino L. Gaubatz S., Xu, Y. Bronson R.T. Warren H.B. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1092-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 553-563PubMed Google Scholar). A similar switch in E2F protein expression occurs in primary cultured murine keratinocytes, which express E2F-1, -2, and -3 in the undifferentiated, proliferative state. Induction of differentiation by elevated extracellular Ca+2 causes a reduction in these E2F forms, with a concomitant increase in E2F-5 protein, and no substantial change in E2F-4 levels (26D'Souza S.J.A. Pajak A. Balazsi K. Dagnino L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23531-23538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Notably, the up-regulation of E2F-5 in differentiating keratinocytes is accompanied by formation of complexes containing E2F-5, p130, and histone deacetylase 1, which appear to be involved in irreversible cell cycle withdrawal (26D'Souza S.J.A. Pajak A. Balazsi K. Dagnino L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23531-23538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The presence of E2F-5·p130 species in the nucleus of differentiated keratinocytes prompted us to investigate the mechanisms controlling E2F-5 subcellular localization. We now report differential regulation of E2F-4 and E2F-5 subcellular distribution upon induction of keratinocyte maturation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that E2F-5 has distinct domains that determine its subcellular localization. Specifically, E2F-5 has an intrinsic nuclear localization domain, which allows it to translocate into the nucleus independently of interactions with DP or pRB family proteins, and a nuclear export domain, which contributes to cytoplasmic localization mediated by active nuclear export through CRM1. Anti-E2F-4 (sc-866), anti-E2F-5 (sc-999), and monoclonal anti-GST (sc-138) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Rabbit Anti-GST- (71–7500) and monoclonal anti-FLAG M5 antibodies were, respectively, from Zymed Laboratories Inc. and Eastman Kodak. Restriction enzymes were from Invitrogen or from New England Biolabs. Digitonin was from Calbiochem. Essential minimal Eagle’s medium without Ca+2 was purchased from BioWhittaker; all other cell culture materials were from Invitrogen. Cy3- and FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. FITC-conjugated dextran (Mr 70,000) was purchased from ICN. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. HeLa, MCF-7, and HEK293 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. IMDF cells are a line of spontaneously immortalized dermal fibroblasts that we isolated from the dermis of a 2-day-old CD-1 mouse. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’ medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Primary mouse keratinocytes were isolated, cultured, and infected with recombinant adenovirus as described (26D'Souza S.J.A. Pajak A. Balazsi K. Dagnino L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23531-23538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Primary keratinocytes were maintained as proliferating, undifferentiated cells in medium containing 50 μmCa+2 or induced to differentiate in medium containing ≥0.1 mm Ca+2. Transient transfections on HeLa, MCF-7, HEK293, or IMDF cells were conducted by the calcium phosphate method, using 1 μg of DNA/well in a 12-well culture plate. Primary mouse keratinocytes were transfected with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). For nuclear export studies, cells were plated on glass coverslips in 12-well culture dishes so that they were 40–50% confluent the next day. At that time, they were transfected with indicated plasmids and, 24–48 h after DNA addition, they were processed for fluorescence microscopy. To inhibit CRM1-mediated nuclear export, transfected cells were cultured with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml, final) and leptomycin B (10 ng/ml, final) for 4 h prior to processing for microscopy. GST-E2F-1 and GST-E2F-2 plasmids were gifts from Drs. P. Hamel (University of Toronto) and D. C. Heimbrook (Merck Research Laboratories). GST-E2F-3 was obtained by excision of a 2-kb BamHI/XbaI fragment from CMV-E2F-3 (27Krek W. Ewen M.E. Shirodkar S. Arany Z. Kaelin W.G.J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1994; 78: 161-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and cloning in-frame into pET-41a (Novagen). GST-E2F-4 was produced by cloning a 2.5-kb SalI/EcoRI fragment from CMV-E2F4 (28Beijersbergen R.L. Kerkhoven R.M. Zhu L. Carlee L. Voorhoeve P.M. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2680-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) into pET-41b (Novagen). FLAG-tagged E2F-5 was constructed by cloning in-frame an EcoRI fragment form CMV-E2F-5 corresponding to the mouse E2F-5 cDNA (29Buck V. Allen K.E. Sorensen T. Bybee A. Hijmans E.M. Voorhoeve P.M. Bernards R. La Thangue N.B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 31-38PubMed Google Scholar) into pBK-CMVΔLacZ-FLAG (a modified pBK-CMV expression vector (Stratagene) lacking the β-galactosidase cDNA), which contained FLAG-encoding sequences. The resulting plasmid (FLAG-E2F-5) encodes the full-length E2F-5 cDNA downstream from the FLAG tag. GFP-E2F-5 was generated by cloning in-frame a 1-kb BamHI/HindIII fragment encoding the tagged E2F-5 cDNA from FLAG-E2F-5 into pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH). GFP-E2F-5-(Δ315–332), which lacks the pRB family-binding domain, GFP-E2F-5-(105–332), and mutants containing C-terminal deletions were obtained by PCR. GFP-E2F-5-(Δ84–128) was obtained byEcoRV/BglII excision of a 146-bp fragment, followed by Klenow treatment and ligation. GFP-E2F-5-(1–56) was generated excising from GFP-E2F-5 sequences corresponding to amino acids 57–339 and vector ligation. GFP-E2F-5-(1–130) was obtained by excision of a 650-bp BglII/BamHI fragment corresponding to amino acids 131–332 from GFP-E2F-5. Wild type GST-E2F-5 was obtained by cloning in-frame a 1-kbEcoRI fragment from FLAG-E2F-5 into pGEX-KG (a pGEX2T derivative with a polyglycine linker at the thrombin cleavage site). GST-E2F-5-(Δ315–332) was constructed by isolating a 1-kbHindIII/EcoRI fragment corresponding to mouse E2F-5-(Δ315–332) and cloning in-frame into pET-41c. GST-E2F-5-(105–346) was constructed by cloning a 670-bp BglII/HindIII fragment encoding mouse E2F-5 amino acids 105–346 from FLAG-mE2F5 in-frame into pET-41c. GST-E2F-5-(1–56) and GST-E2F-5-(1–179) were constructed by removal from GST-E2F-5-(Δ315–332) of fragments corresponding to E2F-5 amino acids 57–346 and 180–332, respectively, followed by ligation. GST-GFP was constructed by cloning a 738-bpNcoI-EcoRI fragment encoding the EGFP cDNA from pEGFP-C2 (CLONTECH) into pET-41a(+). GST-GFP-NLS was constructed by cloning in-frame a phosphorylated double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the NLS of SV40 large T antigen (PKKKRKV) into GST-GFP. All mutant cDNAs were verified by sequencing using dideoxy methodology. GST fusion proteins containing E2F-1, -2, or -5 sequences were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene), and those containing E2F-3 or E2F-4 sequences were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)-RP. All other GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). To induce protein production, bacteria were cultured at 37 °C in NYZ medium to an optical density of 1 (600 nm) and then supplemented with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), and lysed by passing twice through a pre-chilled French press at 1000–1500 p.s.i. After clearing the lysates by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), the supernatants were incubated for 30 min at 22 °C with 100 μl of a glutathione-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Biosciences). The bound proteins were washed thrice with ice-cold lysis buffer, followed by elution in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) containing 10 mmglutathione for 30 min at 4 °C. With the exception of GST-E2F-5, no significant degradation products for each GST fusion protein were detected by SDS-PAGE analysis (not shown). Full-length GST-E2F-5 was purified from partial-length fusion proteins by fast protein liquid chromatography on a SP-Sepharose column. All experiments conducted contained fractions with ≥95% full-length GST-E2F-5. Transport assays were performed essentially as described previously (30Kurisaki A. Kose S. Yoneda Y. Heldin C.-H. Moustakas A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 31Adam S.A. Marr R.S. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips 24–48 h prior to use. The cells were rinsed three times with transport buffer (hereafter termed TB; composed of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 110 mm KOAc, 2 mmMg(OAc)2, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA), and permeabilized for 10 min at 4 °C with TB containing 2 mmDTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 40 μg/ml digitonin. After two washes with TB, the coverslips were immersed in TB supplemented with protease inhibitors and 2 mm DTT, and incubated at room temperature (22–23 °C) for 5 min. Excess buffer was removed, and the permeabilized cells were incubated with transport reaction mixture consisting of complete transport (CT) buffer, HeLa cytosol extract (with protease inhibitors), and the appropriate GST fusion protein for 30 min at the temperature indicated in individual experiments. CT buffer contained TB plus an ATP regeneration system (0.5 mmATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). Assays in the absence of an energy-regenerating system were conducted with TB, no ATP or GTP, and apyrase (10 units/ml). For WGA treatments, permeabilized cells were incubated in the presence of 0.05 mg/ml WGA in TB for 15 min prior to the import reaction. HeLa cytosol extract was prepared as described previously (32Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Kose S. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T. Shimonishi Y. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3617-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cell permeabilization and absence of nuclear membrane damage were verified by the absence of nuclear diffusion of FITC-labeled dextran (Mr 70,000). After the import assay, cells were rinsed with ice-cold transport buffer, and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 40 min. After rinsing, GST fusion proteins were detected by fluorescence microscopy. To this end, the cells were blocked at room temperature in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, rinsed, and probed with an anti-GST antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After three rinses, the cells were probed with the appropriate Cy3- or FITC-labeled secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. After removal of the secondary antibody, the cells were rinsed twice, incubated with Hoescht 33258 (10 μg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature, rinsed five times, and mounted. All photomicrographs were obtained with a Leica DMIRBE microscope equipped with an Orca charge-coupled device camera, using Openlab software (Improvision). The proportion of cells exhibiting the presence or absence of the tested GST fusion protein in the nucleus was calculated from examination of 500–1400 cells in random microscope fields, and each experiment was repeated four to nine times with similar results. Induction of terminal differentiation in mouse epidermal keratinocytes is accompanied by increased E2F-5 protein expression and formation of E2F-5·p130 complexes (26D'Souza S.J.A. Pajak A. Balazsi K. Dagnino L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23531-23538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These complexes are involved in differentiation-induced keratinocyte exit from the cell cycle. To begin to understand the mechanisms regulating the formation of E2F-5·p130 complexes in differentiated epidermal keratinocytes, we examined by fluorescence microscopy the subcellular distribution of E2F-5 in undifferentiated keratinocytes and in cells induced to differentiate with Ca+2. Whereas E2F-5 in undifferentiated keratinocytes is scarce and largely cytoplasmic, induction of differentiation is accompanied by up-regulation and concentration of E2F-5 in the nucleus (Fig.1), consistent with the established formation of the nuclear E2F-5·p130 species. Interaction with pRB family proteins, such as p130, has been proposed to play a role in regulating E2F-4 and E2F-5 subcellular distribution. Consequently, we next examined whether Ca+2-induced retention of E2F-5 in differentiated keratinocytes requires association with p130. It is well established that interactions of E2F with pRB family proteins are disrupted by several viral oncoproteins. The adenovirus E1A protein binds pRB family proteins, thereby releasing E2F (reviewed in Ref. 33Nevins J.R. Science. 1992; 258: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the subcellular localization of E2F-5 in differentiated keratinocytes in which we induced exogenous expression of E1A by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and observed maintenance of nuclear distribution of E2F-5 (Fig. 1), indicating that nuclear retention of E2F-5 does not require interactions with pRB family proteins. E2F-5 shares extensive structural homology and biochemical properties with E2F-4, and these two proteins have frequently been grouped together. Furthermore, nuclear localization of E2F-4 has been associated with cell cycle withdrawal and myoblast differentiation (15Lindeman G.J. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,18Gaubatz S. Lees J.A. Lindeman G.J. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1325-1331PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to E2F-5, E2F-4 mRNA and protein tend to decrease during differentiation in keratinocytes (25Dagnino L. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P. Gallie B.L. Phillips R.A. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 553-563PubMed Google Scholar, 26D'Souza S.J.A. Pajak A. Balazsi K. Dagnino L. J. Biol.

To investigate if there are also differences between E2F-4 and E2F-5 regulation of subcellular localization in keratinocytes, we conducted immunofluorescence assays. We observed that E2F-4 always distributes throughout the cell, irrespective of the differentiation status of the keratinocytes (Fig. 1). These patterns of distribution differ from the constitutively nuclear localization of E2F-1, -2, and -3 in keratinocytes, which we have determined by analysis of fractionated cell extracts (data not shown), and is similar to their distribution in other cell types (14Verona R. Moberg K. Estes S. Starz M. Vernon J.P. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7268-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Lindeman G.J. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Proc. Natl.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2819-2831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the substantial differences in steady-state subcellular distribution of the various E2F proteins, we first investigated the mechanisms mediating their entry into the nucleus, using GST-E2F fusion proteins in in vitronuclear import assays on digitonin-permeabilized cells. This system has been extensively used to characterize basic nuclear import mechanisms of a variety of proteins. We observed that GST fusion proteins containing sequences corresponding to E2F-1, -2, or -3 localized to the nucleus in ≥97% of permeabilized cells (Fig.2), consistent with the reported existence of a NLS in these proteins (14Verona R. Moberg K. Estes S. Starz M. Vernon J.P. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7268-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Lindeman G.J. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Proc. Natl.

Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2819-2831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, and in contrast with their predominantly cytoplasmic distribution in many intact cells, E2F-4 and E2F-5 GST fusion proteins were found in the nucleus in about 60% of the cells (Fig. 2). The nuclear distribution of all E2F-containing GST fusion proteins also differed from GST alone, which was largely cytoplasmic, suggesting that sequences in all the E2F proteins examined contain nuclear localization domains. We next used in vitro import assays to examine the mechanisms involved in E2F-5 nuclear entry, contrasting them with those of E2F-2 translocation. We chose E2F-2 as a prototype of E2F proteins containing a consensus NLS. We initially verified that nuclear E2F entry was indeed mediated and not due to simple diffusion. To this end, we determined the sensitivity of E2F nuclear translocation to low temperature, which impairs mediated transport, but has no effect on simple diffusion. We found that both GST-E2F-2 and GST-E2F-5 proteins were unable to enter the nucleus in experiments conducted at 4 °C, confirming the involvement of mediated transport mechanisms in the import step (Fig. 3). Mediated nuclear import through the nuclear pore requires energy. When we conducted import assays in the absence of all sources of energy (that is, no ATP or GTP, and apyrase to inhibit cellular energy regeneration systems), both E2F proteins showed almost exclusively cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 3). This indicates the involvement of import complex formation and translocation of these complexes through nuclear pores. Finally, transport of proteins through the nuclear pore is inactivated by WGA-induced glycosylation. To confirm that E2F translocation to the nucleus indeed involves nuclear pores, we conducted experiments in permeabilized cells pre-treated with WGA, and found that uptake of GST-E2F-2 and GST-E2F-5 was greatly reduced (Fig. 3). Together, these studies demonstrate that E2F proteins exhibit mediated transport into the nucleus, through mechanisms that make use of the nuclear pore. As mentioned above, analysis of the amino acid sequence in E2F-4 and E2F-5 fails to reveal regions with homology to known nuclear localization signals. For this reason, it has been proposed that these E2F factors enter the nucleus by virtue of complex formation with nuclear E2F-interacting proteins such as DP-2 or pRB family members (14Verona R.

Crystal structures of the Cys-55 → Ser (C55S) and Cys-59 → Ser (C59S) variants of this protein have been determined to 1.25 Å and 1.05 Å resolution, respectively, whereas the resolution of the wild type (WT) has been extended to 1.5 Å. The improved WT structure provides a detailed description of the [2Fe-2S] cluster, including two features that have not been noted previously in any [2Fe-2S] cluster-containing protein, namely, pronounced distortions in the cysteine coordination to the cluster and a Cα-H–Sγ hydrogen bond between cluster ligands Cys-55 and Cys-9. These features may contribute to the unusual electronic and magnetic properties of the [2Fe-2S] clusters in WT and variants of this ferredoxin. The structures of the two variants of Fd4, in which single cysteine ligands to the [2Fe-2S] cluster are replaced by serine, establish the metric details of serine-ligated Fe-S active sites with unprecedented accuracy. Both the cluster and its surrounding protein matrix change in subtle ways to accommodate this ligand substitution, particularly in terms of distortions of the Fe2S2 inorganic core from planarity and displacements of the polypeptide chain.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The first two classes were discovered nearly 40 years ago (2Mortenson L.E. Valentine R.C. Carnahan J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 7: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 3Tagawa K. Arnon D.I. Nature. 1962; 195: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and have since been characterized in considerable detail, including by high resolution x-ray crystallography (4Dauter Z.

Medina M. Frey M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15764-15773Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The third class of Fd is more sparsely distributed and, therefore, has not been investigated as thoroughly (1Meyer J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The best characterized members of that group are [2Fe-2S] Fds from the bacteria Clostridium pasteurianum (6Golinelli M.P. Chatelet C. Duin E.C. Johnson M.K. Meyer J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10429-10437Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar),Azotobacter vinelandii (7Chatelet C. Meyer J. J. Biol. Inorg.

Commun. 1999; 261: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The high level of similarity of these proteins allows for easy transfer of structural information among them. For instance, many properties of molecular variants of the C. pasteurianum[2Fe-2S] Fd (6Golinelli M.P. Chatelet C. Duin E.C. Johnson M.K. Meyer J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10429-10437Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Meyer J. Fujinaga J. Gaillard J. Lutz M.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8995-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) could be rationalized from the crystal structure of A. aeolicus Fd4 (11Yeh A.P. Chatelet C. Soltis S.M. Kuhn P. Meyer J. Rees D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This structure established the unexpected thioredoxin-like fold of these Fds and confirmed that they are distinct from the other two ferredoxin classes (1Meyer J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The 2.3 Å resolution of the Fd4 structure, however, was not among the highest currently reported (about 1 Å) for metalloenzymes. Indeed, such high resolution structures are of utmost interest because they bring forth precise geometries of metal sites (4Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Sieker L.C. Meyer J. Moulis J.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16065-16073Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and may allow description of redox transitions (5Morales R. Charon M.H. Hudry-Clergeon G. Peátillot Y. Nørager S. Medina M. Frey M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15764-15773Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Additional efforts have therefore been made, both on wild type (WT) thioredoxin-like Fds and on several of the molecular variants that were produced over the years (6Golinelli M.P. Chatelet C. Duin E.C. Johnson M.K. Meyer J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10429-10437Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 10Golinelli M.P. Akin L.A. Crouse B.R. Johnson M.K. Meyer J.

Acta. 2001; 1549: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), with the aim of improving the crystallographic data. In some modified forms of C. pasteurianum Fd, cysteine ligands of the Fe-S cluster were replaced by serine (9Meyer J. Fujinaga J. Gaillard J. Lutz M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13642-13650Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 13Fujinaga J. Gaillard J. Meyer J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In their reduced [2Fe-2S]+ level, these serine-ligated active sites were found to assume a delocalized mixed valence state having a ground spin state of 9/2 (14Crouse B.R. Meyer J. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 9612-9613Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Achim C. Golinelli M.P. Bominaar E.L. Meyer J. Mu¨nck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8168-8169Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This unprecedented occurrence in binuclear iron-sulfur clusters has stimulated experimental and theoretical work (16Bominaar E.L. Achim C. Borshch S.A. J. Chem. Phys. 1999; 110: 11411-11422Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 17Achim C. Bominaar E.L. Meyer J. Peterson J. Mu¨nck E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 3704-3714Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The development of these investigations has been hampered, however, by the absence of structural data on serine-ligated [2Fe-2S] active sites and their environment. Because only the Fd4 from A. aeolicus has been crystallized, we have repeated amino acid substitutions in that protein previously performed on C. pasteurianum Fd and produced the C55S and C59S variants that contain serine-ligated [2Fe-2S] clusters. We report here the high resolution structures for both of these variants as well as WT protein which provide accurate metric details for serine-ligated Fe-S clusters in proteins. Fd4 from A. aeolicus was purified as described by Chatelet et al. (8Chatelet C. Gaillard J. Peátillot Y. Louwagie M. Meyer J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The C55S and C59S variants were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis as described for the C56S and C60S counterparts from C. pasteurianum(13Fujinaga J. Gaillard J. Meyer J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The mutagenic oligonucleotides were 5′-cacgcgttcatgGaaccggtgggag-3′ (hybridizing to the coding strand, mutated base in underlined uppercase) and 5′-ggttgcatgaacgcgtCtatgatgggaccg-3′ (hybridizing to the noncoding strand), for C55S and C59S, respectively. The mutated genes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the C55S and C59S proteins were purified as described for the WT (8Chatelet C. Gaillard J. Peátillot Y. Louwagie M. Meyer J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Crystals of oxidized WT, C55S, and C59S Fd4 were prepared by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. Although anaerobic conditions were employed to minimize degradation of the cluster by exposure to atmospheric oxygen, no reductants were present during the crystallizations, so that the proteins should remain in the oxidized state. In the case of C55S, crystals were obtained by equilibrating 2 μl of reservoir solution and 2 μl of ∼83 mg/ml Fd4 C55S (in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0 and 0.2m NaCl) against a reservoir solution containing 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, and 0.1m sodium acetate at pH 4.6. Crystals of Fd4 C59S were obtained by equilibrating 2 μl of reservoir solution and 2 μl of ∼67 mg/ml Fd4 C59S (in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0 and 0.2 m NaCl) against a reservoir solution containing 1.0m 1,6-hexanediol, 0.01 m cobalt chloride and 0.1 m sodium acetate at pH 4.6. WT Fd4 was crystallized by equilibrating 2 μl of ∼10 mg/ml Fd4 (in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0 and 0.2 m NaCl) and 2 μl of reservoir solution against a reservoir solution containing 0.01 mzinc sulfate heptahydrate, 0.1 m MES buffer at pH 6.5, and 25% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 550. Despite the different crystallization conditions, in all three cases nearly isomorphous crystals were obtained in space group C2 (C55S:a = 67.3 Å, b = 59.8 Å,c = 46.9 Å, β = 109.8o; C59S:a = 67.3 Å, b = 59.8 Å,c = 46.8 Å, β = 109.3o; WT:a = 67.2 Å, b = 59.8 Å,c = 47.2 Å, β = 110.3o), with one dimeric Fd4 molecule/asymmetric unit. Diffraction data to 1.25 Å resolution for C55S and 1.05 Å resolution for C59S were collected under cryogenic conditions on beamline 9-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory on an Area Detector Systems Corp. Quantum-4 CCD detector controlled by the distributed control system software BLU-ICE. C55S and C59S data sets were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Upon solvent addition and completion of refinement with CNS, positional and anisotropic B-factor refinements of the model were performed using the programs SHELX97 (24Sheldrick G.M. Schneider T.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar) and REFMAC5 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar), which resulted in a finalR-factor and R-free of 14.4 and 19.6%, respectively. A final round of refinement in SHELX97 yielded the standard uncertainties in atomic coordinates, bond lengths, and angles. The final Fd4 C55S model comprises two subunits (2 × 101 residues, 1,575 atoms), two [2Fe-2S] clusters (8 atoms), and 215 water molecules. Because of the absence of electron density for the first 2 residues at the N terminus and the last 7 residues at the C terminus, these residues were not modeled. The Fd4 C55S model without water molecules was used as the starting model for the Fd4 C59S model. The Fd4 C59S model was refined using a protocol similar to that outlined above for Fd4 C55S to anR-factor and R-free of 13.8 and 16.2%, respectively. As with Fd4 C55S, no electron density was present for the first 2 residues at the N terminus, and the last 7 residues at the C terminus were absent. The final Fd4 C59S model consists of two subunits (2 × 101 residues, 1,576 atoms), two [2Fe-2S] clusters (8 atoms), and 198 water molecules. The Fd4 C55S model without water molecules was also used as the starting model for the high resolution WT structure. The model was refined using CNS (21Bru¨nger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

The cluster geometry was not restrained during refinement. During the solvent addition process, 4 zinc ions and 1 sulfate anion were modeled into difference electron density peaks that were significantly higher than those corresponding to the water molecules. In contrast to the variant structures, the WT temperature factors were not refined anisotropically because of the lower resolution of the data. The final model comprises two subunits (103 residues in subunit A, 101 residues in subunit B, 1,590 atoms), two [2Fe-2S] clusters (8 atoms), 187 water molecules, 4 zinc ions, and 1 sulfate anion. Final refinement statistics for all three structures are listed in Table I. The WT and serine-substituted forms of Fd4 analyzed in this study were crystallized in a monoclinic space group,C2, which is distinct from the original tetragonal form solved at 2.3 Å resolution (11Yeh A.P.

As observed originally, the current structure of WT Fd4 determined at 1.5 Å resolution exists as a homodimer, with each monomer adopting a thioredoxin-like fold (Fig.1A). The two noncrystallographic symmetry-related subunits are nearly identical, with a root mean square deviation of 0.27 Å between 101 Cα atoms. As a consequence of the differences in crystal packing between the original and present WT structures, the two monomers in the Fd4 dimer undergo a slight rigid body shift relative to each other (Fig.1A). With the A subunits of both WT forms superimposed, the shift in the B subunit of the new WT form relative to that of the old form can be characterized quantitatively as a 3.8° rotation about an axis oriented ∼74° from the 2-fold rotation axis relating subunits in the dimer. The axis about which this 3.8° rotation occurs passes near residue Thr-B53, which along with Pro-B52, Gly-B54, and the corresponding residues in subunit A, form a short stretch of antiparallel β-sheet which stabilizes the dimer interface. As a result of this change in dimer packing, the hydrogen bonding geometries of residues in this antiparallel arrangement of β-strands are slightly modified. Because cluster ligand Cys-55 is adjacent to this region, it is possible that these alterations in subunit-subunit packing could be coupled to changes in cluster environment. The differences in crystal interactions are also reflected in changes in conformations in two flexible loop regions spanning residues 13–20 and residues 39–46 (Fig. 1A), the former of which is near the cluster ligands Cys-9 and Cys-22. The [2Fe-2S] cluster, located near the surface of each monomer, is coordinated by 4 cysteines, with Cys-9 and Cys-22 ligating Fe1 and Cys-55 and Cys-59 ligating Fe2 (Fig.1B). At the resolution of the current study, it was possible to conduct the refinement without restraining the cluster geometry, resulting in stereochemical parameters that are both more accurate and also less biased than in the previous WT model. A [2Fe-2S] cluster coordinated by four sulfhydryl groups may be idealized as a framework consisting of two edge-sharing tetrahedral iron sites with a planar Fe2S2 inorganic core. The geometries of real [2Fe-2S] clusters, as observed in both model compounds and in proteins, generally reflect this expectation, although deviations from this idealization are evident (26Berg J.M. Holm R.H. Spiro T.G. Iron Sulfur Proteins. John Wiley & Sons, New York1982: 1-66Google Scholar). TableII summarizes the average stereochemical parameters for [2Fe-2S] clusters in the Fd4 structures described here as well as in proteins refined at high resolution and in model compounds. In general, the bond distances and angles observed in protein-bound [2Fe-2S] clusters agree well with each other and with model compounds. A notable deviation from the idealized symmetry in the protein-bound clusters, however, is the nonplanarity of the Fe2S2 core, which can be characterized by the average absolute value of ∼175° for the Fe-S-S-Fe torsion angle, where 180° would correspond to exact planarity. For further comparison, the Fe2S2 unit present in [4Fe-4S] clusters is significantly more nonplanar than in [2Fe-2S] clusters, with an average value for this torsion angle of only 162.0° (27Strop P. Takahara P.M. Chiu H.-J. Hayley C. Angove C. Burgess B.K. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 651-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The pronounced puckering of this unit in [4Fe-4S] clusters reflects primarily a more compressed Fe-S-Fe angle (71.7°) relative to [2Fe-2S] clusters (75.5°).Table IIAverage stereochemical parameters for Fd4 structures (from Table I)ParameterWTC55SC59SProtein standardsModel compoundBonds (Å) Fe-S2.232.242.232.23 ± 0.032.201 Fe-Fe2.732.692.692.73 ± 0.022.691 S-S3.523.593.553.51 ± 0.043.483Angles (°) S-Fe-S104.5106.2105.6104.3 ± 1.8104.6 Fe-S-Fe75.473.574.475.5 ± 1.075.4 9Sγ-Fe-22Sγ104.6105.1106.1105.1 ± 1.7111.2 55S/Oγ-Fe-59S/Oγ90.596.499.1 ‖Fe-S-S-Fe‖ torsion angle173171177175180Protein standards are the average values for four independent [2Fe-2S] clusters coordinated by four cysteine ligands in protein structures refined at resolutions ≤1.4 Å.

A detailed examination of the geometrical parameters of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in WT Fd4 (Table III) reveals two pronounced outliers: (i) the relatively small Cys-55 Sγ-Fe2 Cys-59 Sγ bond angle and (ii) a relatively long Cys-55 Sγ-Fe2 bond. The Cys-55 Sγ-Fe2 Cys-59 Sγ angle averages 90.5° in the two crystallographically independent subunits of WT Fd4, a value that is significantly smaller than the average Cys-9 Sγ-Fe2-Cys-22 Sγ angle of 104.6° observed in the same structure and the consensus value of 105.1° observed in other well refined [2Fe-2S] protein structures (Table II). The more compressed Cys-55 Sγ-Fe2-Cys-59 Sγ angle has not been observed previously in other well refined ferredoxins with Cys ligands but is similar to the His Nδ-Fe-His Nδ bond angles of ∼94° observed in Rieske type [2Fe-2S] clusters (28Colbert C.L.

Structure. 1996; 4: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The other unusual feature of the Fd4 cluster geometry involves the Cys-55 Sγ-Fe2 bond, which is longer on average by ∼0.06 Å than the other three Fe-Sγ bonds (Table III). Constraints on the position of Cys-55 may contribute to this elongated bond because the residues around Cys-55 are well defined and appear to be relatively rigid, as reflected by the lower average temperature factors in this region (14.9 Å2 for residues 53–57 versus 21.4 Å2 for all protein atoms). An associated phenomenon may be the increased distortion of the peptide bond torsion angles (ω) of the residues surrounding Cys-55, particularly Thr-53, Met-56, and Ala-58, whose ω torsion angles are on average 166.0°, 171.8°, and 189.1°, respectively (2.4, 1.4, and 1.6 standard deviations from the ideal value of 180°). With an average Fe1-S1-S2-Fe2 torsion angle of –173°, the extent of nonplanarity of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in WT Fd4 is comparable with those observed in other well refined [2Fe-2S] protein structures.Table IIICluster geometry in molecules A and B for WT, C55S, and C59S Fd4ParameterResidueWTC55SC59SABABABBonds (Å) Fe1-Fe22.742.722.6922.6812.6972.690 S1-S23.523.523.5903.5923.5483.546 Fe1-S12.242.222.262(7)2.244(7)2.216(4)2.214(3) Fe1-S22.212.192.215(9)2.222(8)2.215(4)2.217(4) Fe2-S12.232.242.20(1)2.200(9)2.232(4)2.220(4) Fe2-S22.252.252.305(8)2.308(8)2.217(4)2.253(4) Sγ-Fe1C92.272.262.330(7)2.328(6)2.303(4)2.302(4) Sγ-Fe1C222.312.282.302(8)2.306(8)2.302(4)2.304(4) Sγ-Fe2C552.342.371.97(1)2.01(2)2.318(4)2.315(5) Sγ-Fe2C592.292.332.300(9)2.296(9)1.940(9)1.942(8)Angles (°) S1-Fe1-S2104.8106.0106.7(3)107.1(3)106.4(2)106.3(2) S1-Fe2-S2103.7103.3105.6(3)105.6(3)104.6(2)104.9(2) Fe1-S1-Fe275.675.174.274.274.774.7 Fe1-S2-Fe275.775.373.172.574.374.0 Sγ-Fe1-SγC9/C22105.0104.3105.7(3)104.6(2)106.1(1)106.1(1) O/Sγ-Fe2-O/SγC/S55-C/S5990.590.496.6(5)96.3(5)100.0(3)98.2(3) Sγ-Fe1-S1C9105.4106.4103.9(3)104.6(3)104.2(1)104.4(1) Sγ-Fe1-S2C9116.7116.2115.7(3)115.2(2)116.5(1)116.1(1) Sγ-Fe1-S1C22115.5113.7115.7(3)114.5(3)115.4(1)115.4(1) Sγ-Fe1-S2C22109.9110.6109.5(3)110.9(3)108.5(1)108.9(1) O/Sγ-Fe2-S1C/S55115.4115.7109.2(6)109.6(6)114.7(2)114.9(2) O/Sγ-Fe2-S2C/S55112.7113.5112.7(5)112.0(5)112.8(1)112.7(2) O/Sγ-Fe2-S1C/S59113.2112.2110.8(4)111.8(4)107.6(3)107.9(3) O/Sγ-Fe2-S2C/S59121.8122.3121.6(3)121.2(3)117.5(3)118.6(3)Torsion Angle (°) Fe1-S1-S2-Fe2−174.4−172.0−170.8−170.6−176.7−176.7Numbers in parentheses correspond to standard uncertainties in the last digit.

Cys-55 also participates in an unusual interaction involving the probable formation of a Cα-H-Sγ hydrogen bond between the Cys-55 Cα-H and Cys-9 Sγ (Fig.2A). This interaction is identified on the basis of the Cys-55 Cα- Cys-9 Sγ and the Cys-55 Cα-H-Cys-9 Sγ distances of 3.6 and 2.7 Å, respectively, with a Cα-H-Sγ angle of 149°.

Using a two-plasmid system these derivatives were co-expressed inVibrio cholerae with cholera toxin B-subunit (CTB) to allow formation and secretion of holotoxin-like molecules (engineered CT, eCTs). Purified eCTs maintained all normal CT properties yet they were more than 10-fold (eCT-6), 100-fold (eCT-16), or 1000-fold (eCT-23) less enterotoxic than wild-type CT. The inverse correlation between enterotoxicity and peptide length indicated sterical interference with the ADP-ribosylating active site in CTA. This interpretation agreed with greater than 1000-fold reductions in cAMP induction, with reductions, albeit not proportional, in in vitro agmatine ADP-ribosylation, and was supported by molecular simulations. Intranasal immunization of mice demonstrated that eCTs retained their inherent immunogenicity and ability to potentiate immune responses to a co-administered heterologous protein antigen, although in variable degrees. Therefore, the addition of STa-related peptides to CTA reduced the toxicity of CT while partly preserving its natural immunoadjuvanticity. These results suggest peptide extensions to CTA are a useful alternative to site-directed mutagenesis to detoxify CT.

Nature. 1981; 292: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The B-subunit (CTB), of 103 amino acids, forms a homopentamer that associates with the A-subunit (CTA), of 240 amino acids, to form a holotoxin. The crystal structure of CT (2Zhang R.G. Scott D.L.

Biol. 1995; 251: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) has shown the CTB pentamer to be a symmetric protein structure with a doughnut-like shape. The central pore in this doughnut-like structure holds CTA by noncovalent interactions. Cell intoxication by CT requires binding of the holotoxin to GM1 ganglioside receptors on the cell surface (3Cuatrecasas P. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3547-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 4Holmgren J. Infect. Immun. 1973; 8: 851-859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pentameric CTB is responsible for interactions with GM1 and five binding pockets have been identified, one per each CTB monomer (5Merritt E.M. Sarfaty S. van den Akker F. L'Hoir C.J. Martial A. Hol W.G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). After binding to GM1, the holotoxin is endocytosed (6Torgersen M.L. Skretting G. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CTA becomes dissociated from the CTB pentamer in a late endosomal or trans-Golgi compartment and is then channeled to the endoplasmic reticulum by retrograde transport (7Majoul I. Sohn K. Wieland F.T. Pepperkok R. Pizza M. Hillemann J. So¨ling H.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 8Bastiaens P.I.H. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. So¨ling H.D. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4243-4248Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Following these events the CTA is translocated to the cytoplasm by an as yet poorly defined mechanism. Once in the cytoplasm, CTA enzymatically cleaves NAD+ and attaches the ADP-ribose moiety to the Gαs component of adenylate cyclase, causing an increase in the intracellular levels of cAMP (9Gill D.M. Meren R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3050-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). This process is stimulated by endogenous proteins designated ADP-ribosylation factors (10Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A. Bacterial Toxins and Virulence Factors in Disease: Handbook of Natural Toxins. 8. Marcel Dekker, New York1995Google Scholar). The ADP-ribosylation activity of CTA is increased when the polypeptide chain is proteolytically cleaved, at or around position 192, to give two polypeptides designated CTA1 and CTA2 (11Kassis S. Hagmann J. Fishman P.H. Chang P.P. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12148-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CTA1 is the enzymatically active portion of CTA and does not significantly interact with the CTB pentamer because interactions with the highly charged central pore in CTB are established by the C-terminal CTA2 polypeptide. Crystallographic studies have revealed that, in the assembled holotoxin, the ADP-ribosylation active site in CTA1 is located at the top of the molecule (2Zhang R.G. Scott D.L. Westbrook M.L. Nance S. Spangler B.D. Shipley G.G. Westbrook E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 5Merritt E.M. Sarfaty S. van den Akker F. L'Hoir C.J. Martial A. Hol W.G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), if taking the binding sites for GM1 as the bottom part of the holotoxin. Catalytically active residues in CTA1 have been located primarily through structural comparisons with other ADP-ribosylating toxins such as exotoxin A fromPseudomonas aeruginosa (12Li M. Dyda F. Benhar I. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9308-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and with the structurally and functionally highly related heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) ofEscherichia coli (13Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E.

Based on such comparisons, and on mutagenesis studies, a number of residues can be identified in CT as necessary either from a structural and/or catalytic point of view, including Arg-7, His-44, Ser-61, Ser-63, Ala-72, Glu-110, and Glu-112 (14Burnette W.N.

Vaccine. 2001; 21: 2534-2541Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In addition, the conformation of a loop, constituted by residues 47–56, appears important for the catalytic activity of the A1 domain because in LT a substantial rearrangement of it must occur to accommodate NAD+ (23Feil I.K. Reddy R. de Haan L. Merritt E.A. van den Akker F. Storm D.R. Hol W.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis targeting one or more of the above CTA residues has had as its primary goal the knocking-out of the ADP-ribosylation activity to detoxify CT. Detoxified CT (or LT) is of great interest in vaccine development because it could potentially be both a good mucosal immunogen for induction of specific antitoxic immunity against cholera or ETEC diarrhea, and as an adjuvant that could potentiate immune responses against co-administered heterologous antigens (24Holmgren J. Lycke N. Czerkinsky C. Vaccine. 1993; 11: 1179-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In our preliminary work (25Sanchez J. Argotte R. Buelna A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we have found that the addition of an analogue of the heat-stable enterotoxin STa of E. coli to CTA caused reductions in CT enterotoxicity. Based on those results, we decided to explore this as an alternative to site-directed mutagenesis for detoxification of CT. Accordingly, we placed various STa-related peptide extensions at the CTA N terminus to then evaluate their effect over the toxic, immunogenic, and immunoadjuvant properties of CT. We here show that the generated CTA fusion proteins efficiently assemble with CTB to form modified engineered CT-like molecules (referred to as eCTs). Further, we demonstrate that the produced molecules are detoxified partly or fully and, because detoxification correlated with peptide length, we propose that it was primarily caused by sterical interference of the added peptides with the ADP-ribosylating active site. Despite detoxification the eCTs were strongly immunogenic as well as immunoadjuvant-active in mice upon intranasal-mucosal immunization. These results indicate that addition of peptides to CTA may be a useful approach to produce detoxified, yet immunogenic and immunoadjuvant-active CT derivatives. The CTA gene as encoded by plasmid pRA003-STd (25Sanchez J. Argotte R. Buelna A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was inserted into the pUC18 polylinker (26Messing J. Vieira J. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 202-209PubMed Google Scholar) and then fused to paired oligonucleotides encoding ASRCAELCCNPACPAP. These cloning steps generated plasmid pJS814, which directed the synthesis of the fusion protein ASRCAELCCNPACPAP-CTA, designated 16-CTA. In plasmid pJS814, as well as in the constructs derived from it, the natural CTA leader peptide was replaced by the leader peptide of the LT B-subunit (27Dallas W.S. Falkow S. Nature. 1979; 277: 406-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the different recombinant CTA genes were expressed from thelac promoter (26Messing J. Vieira J. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 202-209PubMed Google Scholar). Use of the sequence encoding the LT B-subunit leader peptide, including the ribosome-binding site, has earlier provided with high expression levels of CTB in V. cholerae (28Sanchez J. Holmgren J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This seems to also have been the case for CTA, although this was not formally proven. The insert in pJS814 encoding the 16-amino acid peptide was then replaced using PCR by a sequence now encoding APRPGP. The resulting plasmid, designated pJS815, encoded for the fusion protein APRPGP-CTA (6-CTA). In plasmid pJS815 there were single SacI and XmaI sites flanking the new DNA insert, and these restriction sites were used to replace APRPGP by synthetic paired oligonucleotides encoding ANSSNYCCELCCNPACTGCYPGP, the sequence for mature human STa E. coli heat-stable enterotoxin (29Moseley S.L. Hardy J.W. Huq M.I. Echeverria P. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1983; 39: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Aimoto S. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Hara S. Takeda T. Takeda Y. Miwatani Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding ANSSNYCCELCCNPACTGCYPGP-CTA was designated pJS816, and the respective fusion protein was named 23-CTA. Plasmids pJS815 (6-CTA), pJS814 (16-CTA), and pJS816 (23-CTA) were independently electroporated into the CTA-depleted Vibrio cholerae host strain JS1569 (28Sanchez J. Holmgren J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thereafter, a companion compatible plasmid pJS384 encoding recombinant CTB (25Sanchez J. Argotte R. Buelna A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was introduced for genetic in transcomplementation. The use of this two-plasmid system led to efficient assembly and secretion of eCTs into the culture supernatant with an average yield of 25 μg of eCT/ml of culture medium. For expression of eCTs, 2.5-liter Luria Broth liquid cultures supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml), and isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (100 μg/ml) were grown under shaking at 37 °C for 18 h. The expressed eCTs were then isolated from culture supernatants by sodium hexametaphosphate precipitation (31Mekalanos J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 165: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) followed by dialysis of precipitates against phosphate-buffered saline and twice FPLC fractionation on Superdex S-75 columns (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden). This procedure resulted in isolation of ∼10 mg of highly purified eCTs/liter of starting culture media. For characterization, the purified eCTs were first tested by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions and protein bands stained with Coomassie Blue. Commercial wild-type CT (List Biological Laboratories) was used as a standard for protein size comparisons. Western blot assays using anti-CTA (32Svennerholm A.M. Wikstro¨m M. Lindblad M. Holmgren J. Med. Biol. 1986; 64: 23-30PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-STa (33Svennerholm A.M. Wikstro¨m M. Lindblad M. Holmgren J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 24: 585-590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) monoclonal antibodies were also done on SDS-PAGE separated proteins. The epitope recognized by anti-CTA has not been precisely mapped, but it is confined to the CTA1 peptide, and this allowed for detection of constructs under reducing and denaturing conditions that led to the absence of the CTA2 peptide. The GM1-ELISA method for detection of CT (34Holmgren J. Svennerholm A.M. Infect. Immun. 1973; 7: 759-763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was here used to test for assembly of CTA fusion proteins with CTB as well as to demonstrate peptide carriage by CTA. Accordingly, purified eCTs were first bound to GM1-coated plates and then separately reacted with anti-CTB (32Svennerholm A.M. Wikstro¨m M. Lindblad M. Holmgren J. Med. Biol. 1986; 64: 23-30PubMed Google Scholar), anti-CTA, or anti-STa monoclonal antibodies (33Svennerholm A.M. Wikstro¨m M. Lindblad M. Holmgren J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1986; 24: 585-590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by standard ELISA development reactions with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin-enzyme conjugate and enzyme substrate. To assay for residual ADP-ribosylation activity, purified eCTs were tested for agmatine-dependent ADP-ribosylation essentially as described by others (35Kaslow H.R. Platler B. Takada T. Moss J. Mar V.L. Burnette W.N. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Suppl. 1992; 23: 197-199Google Scholar). To estimate reductions in toxicity, constructs were tested at various concentrations in the presence of14C-labeled NAD (10 μm), 10 mmagmatine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 200 μm GTP, and 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin. Reactions were carried out in a 10-μl volume for 2 h at 30 °C. At the end of the incubation period, samples were loaded onto an ion exchange column to retain unincorporated label and radioactivity in effluents (1 ml) measured by liquid scintillation. The biologic-toxic activity of eCTs was estimated by their capacity to induce cAMP in tissue culture cells and by their enterotoxic-diarrheogenic activity in a rabbit model. To test for induction of cAMP accumulation, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown to confluence in plastic bottles, harvested by classical methods, and then seeded onto 96-well plates just prior to the assay. Purified eCTs were then added in concentrations from 10 to 0.01 μg/ml to wells and cells incubated for periods of 3.5, 6.5, and 24 h. At the end of the exposure period, cells were lysed in situ, cell lysates extracted from the wells, and cAMP measurements carried out using the Biotrak kit code RPN225 (Amersham Biosciences) establishing a standard cAMP curve as recommended by the suppliers. Enterotoxicity tests were carried out in rabbit intestinal loops (RIL) essentially as described (36De S. Chatterjee D. J. Pathol. Bacteriol. 1953; 66: 559-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). For assay, 1-ml samples were tested in duplicate and in concentrations ranging from 10 μg/ml down to 0.001 μg/ml by inoculation into two noncontiguous 5-cm small intestine loops. After 18 h of exposure, fluid accumulation was determined and the average volume-to-loop length ratio calculated. Purified CT was used as positive control and purified recombinant CTB (Ref. 28Sanchez J. Holmgren J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar; provided by SBL Vaccine, Stockholm, Sweden) and phosphate-buffered saline as negative controls. Tests for STa toxic activity were done in infant mice with the eCT23 at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in 100-μl volumes. Groups of five BALB/c mice were immunized intranasally with the various eCTs together with ovalbumin (OVA). Twenty μg of OVA were given in 10-μl volumes to lightly anesthetized animals either alone or together with 1 or 10 μg of each eCT, with 1 μg of reference CT or 1 or 100 μg of recombinant CTB. At 2 and 4 weeks, identical booster immunizations were given; after 2 more weeks, the mice were sacrificed and serum samples were obtained. Samples were assayed by ELISA for anti-OVA or anti-CTB antibody levels using either OVA or CT as coating antigens. Positive control sera for each of these antigens were concomitantly tested. Mean values and standard deviations for each group were calculated and results expressed in logarithmic form. Theoretical molecular models for the fusion proteins with the various peptide extensions at the N terminus of CTA were constructed with the Quanta97/CHARMm22 modeling package from Molecular Simulations Inc. Of the three peptide extensions modeled, the models for both 16-CTA and 23-CTA were constructed based on the x-ray crystallographic structure of the toxic domain of the heat-stable enterotoxin STp from porcine E. coli (37Sato T. Ozaki H. Hata Y. Kitagawa Y. Katsube Y. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8641-8650Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) comprising residues 5–17 (STp numbering) as available from the Protein Data Bank data base (entry 1ETN). To generate the model for 23-CTA, amino acids were added to the N- and C-terminal ends of the STp toxic domain in their extended conformation. In the smaller truncated version of STa (16-CTA), three residues on the C-terminal side of the essential heat-stable enterotoxin toxic domain (38Yoshimura S. Ikemura H. Watanabe H. Aimoto S. Shimonishi Y. Hara S. Takeda T. Miwatani T. Takeda Y. FEBS Lett. 1985; 181: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) are missing, including Cys-18, and this leaves an odd number of cysteines (five). To maintain an even number of cysteine residues for correct formation of the two remaining disulfide bridges, Cys-7 was changed to Ala (39Sanchez J. Svennerholm A.M. Holmgren J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 110-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This was calculated to allow for formation of disulfide bridges 6:11 and 10:15. This modification was performed prior to the appearance of the three-dimensional structure, which reveals that the disulfide bridges actually are formed by cysteines 6:11, 7:15, and 10:18. However, manipulation of the side chain torsion angles of cysteines 10 and 15 shows that these two residues may form a disulfide bridge with very minor perturbations of the remainder of the structure. Furthermore, retained antibody binding (40Sanchez J. Johansson S. Lowenadler B. Svennerholm A.M. Holmgren J. Res. Microbiol. 1990; 141: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) supports the supposition that the overall folding is very similar to that of the toxic domain of ST (residues 5–17). Finally, the smallest peptide extension (6-CTA) was simply built as an extended chain for analysis. All three extensions were subject to energy refinement both prior to and after addition to the N terminus of CTA (Protein Data Bank entry1XTC) (2Zhang R.G. Scott D.L. Westbrook M.L. Nance S. Spangler B.D. Shipley G.G. Westbrook E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), having conformations allowing maximal reach up toward the putative catalytic cleft. Only minor perturbations of the side chains surrounding the N terminus of CTA were found. Molecular dynamics simulations (200 ps) in vacuum for the three CTA constructs were carried out mainly to study local conformational properties of the proteins to allow the different extensions to assume probable interactions with the CTA molecular surface. Apart from the extensions themselves, all residues on CTA corresponding to regions for which interactions might occur were allowed freedom of movement. A distance-dependent dielectric constant (ε = 6r) was used for the simulations, and the SHAKE algorithm was used to constrain bonds containing hydrogen atoms, allowing a time step of 2 fs. Simulations were started by heating the system from 0 K up to the final temperature (300 K) using a 5-K increment every 100 time steps, followed by an equilibration period of 10 ps. Convincing evidence for assembly of peptide-extended CTA-fusion proteins with CTB was provided by comparison of FPLC profiles of the different eCTs with those for unmodified CT, pentameric CTB, and isolated CTA (Fig. 1). The eCT6 and eCT23 gave single peaks, whereas there was a “shoulder” for the eCT16. The appearance of this shoulder was attributable to a modest degree of spontaneous dissociation into pentameric CTB and free (peptide-extended) CTA. Lower stability of this eCT was confirmed by showing that repeated freezing and thawing caused an increase in the height of the peak and a lower GM1-ELISA titer when assaying for assembled (see below) eCT. Further evidence for assembly of the different CTA fusion proteins into holotoxin-like molecules and for the carriage of peptide extensions by CTA was provided by SDS-PAGE, Western blots analyses, and GM1-ELISA tests. After separation from CTB during SDS-PAGE (Fig.2A) and reaction with specific antibodies in Western blot assays, 6-CTA, 16-CTA, and 23-CTA subunit proteins reacted with an anti-CTA antibody (Fig. 2B) and the position of immunoreactive bands showed a slightly slower migration than that for unmodified CTA. The 16-CTA and 23-CTA proteins also reacted with anti-STa monoclonal antibodies in support of their carriage of the expected STa-related peptides (Fig. 2B). The GM1-ELISA test served to support both the assembly of peptide-extended CTA proteins with CTB and carriage of appropriate peptides. In the GM1-ELISA, the CTA subunit is detected only when associated to CTB because binding to GM1depends upon the CTB pentamer (1Holmgren J. Nature. 1981; 292: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Therefore, the positive reaction with anti-CTA in GM1-ELISA (Fig.3A) constitutes proof that CTA derivatives in the eCTs are assembled with the CTB pentamer in a fashion that did not interfere with the latter moiety binding to GM1 (and then most likely also to cells). Interestingly, even though concentrations of eCTs were adjusted to the same value, some differential reactivity of the three constructs was observed (Fig.3A). Differences in reactivity in the GM1-ELISA could be caused by differently efficient binding to GM1 and thus reflect variable amounts of bound eCT; however, reactions with anti-CTB monoclonal antibody showed essentially identical reactivity in the various samples (data not shown). We therefore attribute the differential reactivity to unequal accessibility of the anti-CTA epitope rather than differences in GM1 binding. In the same way that reactivity with anti-CTA could only take place if CTA was associated with CTB, reaction of both the 16-CTA and 23-CTA constructs with anti-STa monoclonal antibody in the GM1-ELISA will occur only if the complex carries the STa-related peptides. Thus, the positive reaction with anti-STa antibodies in GM1-ELISA by both 16-CTA and 23-CTA proves the presence of peptide extensions onto CTA (Fig.3B). In brief, FPLC profiles for the three different eCTs, and their reactions with anti-CTA and anti-STa monoclonal antibodies in Western blots and in GM1-ELISA, all provided solid evidence for the authenticity of the peptide-extended CTA proteins and for their efficient assembly with pentameric CTB into CT-like holotoxins. To determine the effect of peptide extensions on the toxic-active catalytic activity of CTA in mammalian cells, the capacity of the different eCTs to induce cAMP accumulation in CHO cells was determined in comparison with that of wild-type CT. Various eCT concentrations and incubation times were tested. Results show that all eCTs had very marked reductions in their ability to induce cAMP accumulation being >1,000-fold and up to >100,000-fold less toxic than CT (Fig 4,A–C). Although the cAMP induction capacity of eCTs relative to CT did not essentially change with exposure time, the absolute activity did. Therefore, at the longest 24-h exposure time (Fig.4C), the activity of the eCT6 and eCT16 was much higher than at 3.5 h and the activity of the eCT23 turned to a measurable value from a totally negative response. A similar delay was not observed for wild-type CT, for which the maximal cAMP induction occurred between 3.5 and 6.5 h (Fig. 4). To find out whether reductions in cAMP accumulation were reflected in lower enterotoxicity of eCTs, RIL assays were conducted. The RIL tests showed the eCT6 to be substantially (10-fold) less toxic than CT, the eCT16 to be ≥100-fold less toxic, and the eCT23 to display no activity even at the highest dose tested (10 μg/ml), thus being >1000-fold less active than wild-type CT (Table I). The RIL results correlated with cAMP induction tests and suggested that the addition of peptides to the N terminus of CTA reduced the enterotoxic capacity of CT because of diminished CTA catalytic activity. As observed for cAMP induction, decreases in enterotoxicity were found to also correlate inversely with the length of the added peptide. The eCT23 were also tested for STa enterotoxic activity at 10 μg/ml (0.1 ml/dose) in infant mice and gave a negative result.Table IRabbit intestinal loop assay showing decreased enterotoxicity of eCTsDoseCTeCT6eCT16eCT23CTBμg10NDND0.5<0.1<0.111.71-aFluid accumulation expressed as ml/cm.0.7<0.1<0.1<0.10.11.2<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.10.010.2<0.1<0.1<0.1<0.10.001<0.1NDNDNDNDND, not determined.1-a Fluid accumulation expressed as ml/cm.

Results show reductions in ADP-ribosylating capacity that also correlated with the length of the added peptide. However, d"

The overexpression of p21SNFTleads to the significant and specific repression of transcription from the interleukin-2 promoter as well as from several essential activator protein 1 (AP-1)-driven composite promoter elements. One example is the distal nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT)/AP-1 element where the AP-1 (Fos/Jun) basic leucine zipper heterodimer interacts with members of the NF-AT family. p21SNFT has been shown to replace Fos in dimerization with Jun on a consensus AP-1 binding site (12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE)) and to interact with Jun and NF-AT at the distal NF-AT/AP-1 enhancer element. A detailed biochemical analysis presented here compares interactions involving p21SNFT with those involving Fos. The results demonstrate that a p21SNFT/Jun dimer binds a TRE similarly to AP-1 and like AP-1 binds cooperatively with NF-AT at the NF-AT/AP-1 composite element. However, Fos interacts significantly more efficiently than p21SNFT with Jun and NF-AT, and the replacement of Fos by p21SNFT in the trimolecular complex drastically alters protein-DNA contacts.

Combinatorial regulation is a powerful mechanism enabling transcription to be tightly controlled. The expression and induction levels of various transcription factors are cell and tissue type-dependent, leading to highly context-specific activities that are also coordinated by cooperativity between factors and sequence-specific DNA affinities (1Kohler J.J.

IL-2 is the major mitogenic cytokine produced in T lymphocytes in response to antigenic stimulation through the T cell receptor and coreceptor CD28. This activation is an essential event in the T cell-mediated immune response, leading to both clonal expansion of the T cell and activation of other cell types involved in the response (7Crabtree G.R.

Although NF-AT is able to bind this element alone, the presence of AP-1 greatly stabilizes the interaction (31Sun L.J. Peterson B.R. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 837-848PubMed Google Scholar). The AP-1 binding element is a low affinity site and neither Fos/Jun heterodimers nor Jun homodimers bind easily unless recruited by NF-AT (16Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). In contrast, Fos/Jun heterodimers and Jun homodimers readily bind a consensus TRE (12-O-tetradecanolyphorbol-13-acetate response element) in the absence of other proteins (33Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2324) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that the overexpression of p21SNFT leads to the specific repression of both human IL-2 promoter activity and the production of IL-2 by activated Jurkat cells (34Iacobelli M. Wachsman W. McGuire K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). p21SNFT is constitutively expressed, and several lines of evidence strongly indicate that it is able to replace Fos in dimerization with Jun on AP-1 binding sites (34Iacobelli M. Wachsman W. McGuire K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To develop an understanding of its mechanism of activity, heterodimeric complexes formed by p21SNFT with Jun were compared in detail to c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers. Like several known bZIP transcription factors including Fos and Jun family members (35Echlin D.R. Tae H.J. Mitin N. Taparowsky E.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1752-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Aronheim A. Zandi E. Hennemann H. Elledge S.J. Karin M. Mol. Cell.

Virol. 1997; 71: 3188-3196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), p21SNFTlocalized to the nucleus. Additionally, interactions between a p21SNFT/Jun dimer and NF-AT at the human distal NF-AT/AP-1 enhancer were shown to be highly cooperative similar to those of AP-1 proteins with NF-AT. However, a NF-AT/AP-1 complex formed more efficiently and footprinted DNA differently than a complex containing p21SNFT in place of Fos. The results suggest that a ternary complex containing p21SNFT may be conformationally distinct from one containing Fos and may explain the repression of NF-AT/AP-1 activity observed in the presence of this protein. The IL-2 luciferase (38McGuire K.L. Iacobelli M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1319-1327PubMed Google Scholar), pCI/SNFT (34Iacobelli M. Wachsman W. McGuire K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), pNFATpx5 (39Jain J. Burgeon E. Badalian T.M. Hogan P.G. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4138-4145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and GST-SNFT (34Iacobelli M. Wachsman W. McGuire K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) constructs have been described previously. The GFP-SNFT construct was cloned by digesting pCI/SNFT withNotI/SalI and blunting the NotI site with T4 DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The resulting fragment was ligated in the appropriate reading frame into a modified pEGFP-N2 vector (CLONTECH, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) digested withSmaI/SalI. The His6-Fos and His6-Jun purification constructs pQE30-Fosdb and pQE32-Jundb contain the DNA binding domains of human c-Fos (amino acids 59–211) and human c-Jun (amino acids 223–333) cloned into the pQE His6 expression plasmids from Qiagen, Inc (Valencia, CA). Transient transfection assays in Jurkat cells were performed as described previously (34Iacobelli M. Wachsman W. McGuire K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) using 5 μg of IL-2 luciferase construct and the indicated amounts of pCI/SNFT, GFP-SNFT, or pEGFP expression constructs. Cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 1.5 μm ionomycin and harvested, and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (34Iacobelli M. Wachsman W. McGuire K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 2 μg of pEGFP or GFP-SNFT DNA were used in transient transfection assays in HeLa cells using the LipofectAMINE Plus Kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Mock transfections included no DNA. 20 h posttransfection, cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy, and images were saved to disk using C-View for Windows (DVC Company, Austin, TX). Transfections were then stimulated with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or left unstimulated, and images were taken 24 h poststimulation. Cell lysates were harvested for Western blots 24 h poststimulation. Lysate preparation and Western blots for p21SNFT were done as described previously (34Iacobelli M. Wachsman W. McGuire K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Western blots for green fluorescent protein (GFP) were identical with the exceptions that the blocking buffer used was 5% milk/TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), the primary antibody was a rabbit anti-full-length GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:2000 in 5% milk/TBST, and incubation with this antibody was done overnight at 4 °C. GST-SNFT was purified as described previously (34Iacobelli M. Wachsman W. McGuire K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). DH5α Escherichia coli containing the pNFATpx5 plasmid expressing the DNA binding domain of NF-ATp were cultured in Luria Broth in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C, 255 rpm to an A 600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h, and cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 rpm at 4 °C. His6-NF-AT was purified to ∼90% according to the QiaExpressionist protocol for purification from bacterial cells under denaturing conditions (Qiagen) using 5-ml columns from the QiaExpress IV kit. pQE30-Fosdb and pQE32-Jundb were transformed into M15 E. coli cells, selected using 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin, and grown to an A 600 of 0.6. Proteins were purified to ∼80 and 90%, respectively, using the QiaExpressionist protocol for purification from mammalian cells under native conditions and 5-ml columns from the QiaExpress IV kit. The protocol was modified to include 40 mm imidazole in the wash buffer. To renature proteins, purified proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein purities were assessed using SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Activities were verified by EMSA analysis. Consensus TRE and NF-AT/AP-1 double-stranded oligonucleotide probes used for EMSA analysis were described previously (34Iacobelli M. Wachsman W. McGuire K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in 25 μl of total volume of 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml poly(dI·dC). 10,000–25,000-cpm probe (doubly end-labeled with [32P]dATP) was added to each, and reactions were incubated for an additional 15 min prior to gel loading. Samples were loaded onto a 6.6% native acrylamide gel and run at 170 V for 2.5–3.5 h in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) running buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) or PhosphorImager cassette (Amersham Biosciences). To determine the ratios of specific unbound DNA (Ds) to specific bound DNA (PDs), EMSA analyses were performed as described above using purified proteins. A protocol by Emerson et al. (40Emerson B.M. Lewis C.D. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1985; 41: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) was modified to calculate specificversus nonspecific DNA affinities for the conditions used. Labeled TRE or NF-AT/AP-1 site (specific DNA) was used at 216 pm, and proteins were used at the concentrations found to maximally shift this concentration of probe as described under “Results” dimerization studies. These parameters were held constant, and specific DNA (unlabeled) was titrated over several reactions to 108 nm. In addition, 0.01 μg/μl unlabeled double-stranded poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Biosciences) was included in each reaction. The concentration of nonspecific sites (Dn) is 0.01 μg/μl/660 μg/μmol (15.1 μm) in each reaction (∼140-fold greater than PDs + Ds). In EMSA analyses, the total concentration of specific sites (PDs + Ds) is equal to the input concentrations of labeled plus unlabeled specific DNA. EMSAs were exposed to PhosphorImager cassette. Free (unshifted) and bound (shifted) specific DNA were quantitated using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences), and percent free versus percent bound was calculated. PDs and Ds were determined in Equations 1 and2. Ds=(concentration of specific sites)(%free)Equation 1 PDs=(concentration of specific sites)(%bound)Equation 2 The ratio of specific to nonspecific affinity (K r) is determined by Equation 3 (40Emerson B.M. Lewis C.D. Felsenfeld G. Cell. 1985; 41: 21-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), (PDs)(Dn)(Ds)=(Kr)(P0−PDs)Equation 3 where K r is identified as the negative slope of the line produced when these values are plotted. Footprinting probes were generated by cloning the matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) or IL-2 promoter regions into the pCR2.1 TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). Singly end-labeled probes were prepared by digesting to produce a 5′ overhang filling in with [32P]dATP or dCTP and Klenow (New England Biolabs), and 3′ blunt-digesting to yield the appropriate fragments, which were subsequently gel purified. Binding reactions were similar to those in EMSAs using 25,000-cpm probe/sample. Following the reactions, 4 μl of RQ DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI) diluted 1:5 in 10 mmTris, pH 8.0, was added to the sample, and samples were incubated for 2 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped in 25 μl of 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 50 μg/ml tRNA, and 150 μl of 0.3 m NaOAc, pH 5.5, 1% SDS, 50 μg/ml tRNA were added. MgCl2 was added to 10 mm final concentration, and reactions were ethanol-precipitated either immediately or following phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and chloroform extractions. The DNA was pelleted, counted, and resuspended to equal cpm/μl (∼5000) in 95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol. Samples were boiled, and 5 μl each (∼25,000 cpm) were loaded to 1× Tris borate EDTA, 8% acrylamide, 42% urea-sequencing gels. Gels were run in 1× Tris borate EDTA at 1600 V for 2.5–4.5 h, dried, and exposed to PhosphorImager cassette. Sequencing reactions using T7 Sequenase version 2.0 DNA ddNTP sequencing kit (Amersham Life Sciences, Cleveland, OH) were run alongside to identify the sequences of footprinted regions. To match the sequence with the 5′ singly end-labeled probe, each sequencing primer was the reverse complement of the labeled strand such that the 5′ end of the primer matched the 3′ blunt-digested end of the probe. Consequently, each sequence read was the reverse complement of the digested footprinting probe. Singly end-labeled DNA probes were prepared, and binding reactions were performed as described above. Following the reactions, 7 μl of MPE reagent (100 μm MPE, 200 μmFe2+(NH4)2(SO4)2) and 2.5 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol were added, and the reactions were incubated for 7 min at room temperature. 150 μl of stop solution was added (70 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.82m NH4OAc, 1% SDS, 50 μg/ml tRNA), and reactions were phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol-extracted twice and then chloroform-extracted. 300 μl of 2.92 mNH4OAc was added followed by 500 μl of isopropyl alcohol. Following isopropyl alcohol precipitations, samples were counted and resuspended, and gel was run as described above. To determine the subcellular localization of p21SNFT, a p21SNFTexpression construct containing a N-terminal GFP tag, was generated and used in transient transfection assays in HeLa cells. Because HeLa cells are adherent and contain a relatively small nucleus, the nuclear and cytoplasmic areas can be easily distinguished. Cells transfected with either GFP (27 kDa) or GFP-SNFT (48 kDa) were examined under both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated and unstimulated conditions, and fluorescence microscopy was used to locate GFP. Transfections were harvested, and the presence of GFP and GFP-SNFT was verified by Western blotting (Fig. 1 A). In Western blots probed for GFP (Fig. 1 A, top), both GFP (lanes 3 and 6) and GFP-SNFT (lanes 4and 7) are constitutively expressed in the appropriate transfectants but not in untransfected cells (lanes 2 and5). An identical blot probed for p21SNFT (Fig.1 A, bottom) confirms the presence of GFP-SNFT in cells transfected with this construct (lanes 4 and7). Fig. 1 B demonstrates that GFP-SNFT localizes to the nucleus in transfected cells (right panels), whereas GFP remains cytoplasmic (left panels). These data demonstrate that the presence of the p21SNFT protein causes translocation of GFP from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The results suggest that like other bZIP transcription factors, endogenous p21SNFT is probably a nuclear protein. To determine the response of IL-2 promoter activity to GFP-tagged p21SNFT relative to untagged p21SNFT, transient transfection assays were performed in the Jurkat transformed T cell line. Cells were transfected with a luciferase construct driven by the proximal 300-bp region of the IL-2 promoter in the presence or absence of p21SNFT expression constructs. As shown in Fig.1 C, IL-2 promoter activity is 70–85% reduced in response to p21SNFT expression; the GFP-SNFT expression construct represses the IL-2 promoter comparably to the pCI/SNFT construct. In contrast, the GFP protein alone produces no significant repression. The data demonstrate that the repression observed is specifically attributed to the presence of p21SNFT and suggest that the 27-kDa N-terminal GFP tag does not affect the localization or activity of the p21SNFT protein. EMSA analyses were performed to demonstrate the in vitro interactions of p21SNFT with DNA and with other proteins. Bacterially expressed c-Fos and c-Jun bZIP domains and full-length p21SNFT were purified and examined for binding to a consensus TRE (Fig. 2 B).Lane 1 shows the migration of TRE probe in the absence of proteins, and lanes 2–4 demonstrate that all three proteins were used at concentrations insufficient to form homodimers under the given conditions. This is particularly important for Jun, which homodimerizes on a consensus TRE at higher concentrations. When Fos and Jun are present together, an AP-1 heterodimer forms as expected (lane 5). The titration of increasing amounts of p21SNFT into this complex results in the gradual appearance of a higher molecular weight complex, coinciding with a gradual decrease in the AP-1 dimer (lanes 6–8). Lane 9demonstrates that the higher molecular weight complex is formed by a p21SNFT/Jun dimer. The data are consistent with previous observations (34Iacobelli M. Wachsman W. McGuire K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that p21SNFT can bind a TRE with Jun and strongly suggest that it can physically replace Fos in the AP-1 complex. In vitro interactions of p21SNFT were also assessed on the distal NF-AT/AP-1 enhancer element from the IL-2 promoter (Fig. 2 C). EMSA analysis was performed using purified bacterially expressed proteins as indicated. Fos, Jun, and p21SNFT were used at concentrations that do not form homodimers or heterodimers in the absence of NF-AT (lanes 2–7). In contrast, NF-AT binds alone (lane 8).Lanes 9–12 demonstrate that at the concentrations used, NF-AT does not interact with Fos, Jun, or p21SNFThomodimers or with Fos/p21SNFT heterodimers. This is particularly relevant for Jun (lane 10), because at higher Jun concentrations, a NF-AT/Jun/Jun complex forms at this site (Figs.4, 6, and 7) (16Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the same concentrations of NF-AT, Fos, and Jun incubated together produce a NF-AT/AP-1 complex (lane 13), whereas NF-AT, p21SNFT, and Jun produce a higher molecular weight complex (lane 14). If all four proteins are incubated together, the NF-AT/Fos/Jun and NF-AT/p21SNFT/Jun complexes are both apparent, but no new complex forms (lane 15), indicating that only one complex or the other can form on a single piece of DNA. These data support previous results suggesting that p21SNFT competes with Fos on the NF-AT/AP-1 distal enhancer for dimerization with Jun (34Iacobelli M. Wachsman W. McGuire K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 860-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Figure 6An NF-AT/p21SNFT/Jun complex footprints differently than a NF-AT/AP-1 complex. Purified proteins were used in DNase I footprinting analyses on the antisense strand (A) and the sense strand (B) of the human IL-2 promoter region (−314 to −219). The NF-AT and AP-1 binding elements of the distal NF-AT/AP-1 enhancer region located at −275 (sequences 5′-GGAAAA-3′ and 5′-TCATACA-3′, respectively) are marked on both strands. Jun (J) was titrated from 320 to 1280 nm in lanes 3–5 and held constant at 320 nm in lanes 6–14. p21SNFT(S) and Fos (F) were titrated from 61 to 976 nm and 55 to 440 nm, respectively, where indicated. NF-AT was used at 1.7 μm in lane 2and held constant at 256 nm in lanes 3–13.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7The difference in footprint observed between NF-AT/AP-1 and NF-AT/p21SNFT/Jun complexes is confirmed using MPE:Fe. Purified proteins were used in MPE:Fe footprinting analyses on the antisense strand (A) and the sense strand (B) of the IL-2 promoter in binding reactions identical to those in Fig. 6. C, EMSA analysis of identical binding reactions was used to verify the formation of a NF-AT/p21SNFT/Jun complex under the conditions footprinted. NF-AT/probe (N), NF-AT/p21SNFT/Jun (N/S/J), and NF-AT/AP-1 (N/A) complexes are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is particularly significant that a p21SNFT/Jun dimer does not bind DNA in the absence of NF-AT at this site (lane 7) despite the fact p21SNFT and Jun will readily dimerize on a consensus TRE using proteins from the same preparations at these concentrations (Fig. 2 B). This finding demonstrates that interactions between the p21SNFT/Jun dimer and NF-AT are highly cooperative as has been shown for NF-AT and AP-1 (16Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). To compare the ability of Jun to dimerize with p21SNFTrelative to Fos or with itself, purified proteins were used in quantitative EMSA analyses. The absolute amounts of each protein used in these studies are dependent on the percent of each individual preparation that is active. The studies are based on the assumption that if more Jun from a single protein preparation is required to optimally dimerize with p21SNFT than with Fos, the overall ability of Jun to interact with p21SNFT is lower than its ability to interact with Fos. The first study compared the formation of p2"

As the initiator of the coagulation cascade of limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL),1 Factor C (FC) is a multidomain serine protease, which is activated by a trace amount of its ligand, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide; LPS) (1Ho B. Microbiol. Lett. 1983; 24: 81-84Google Scholar). LAL is widely employed to detect the presence of LPS in various industrial and clinical products (2Pearson F.C. Weary M.E. Sargent H. Novitsky T.J. Lin H. Lindsay G. Bersofsky R.N. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1985; 50: 91-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequence indicates that FC is a complex modular protein, comprising 11 domains (see Ref. 3Muta T. Miyata T. Misumi Y. Tokunaga F. Nakamura T. Toh Y. Ikehara Y. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6554-6561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholarand Fig. 1 A). Many earlier attempts to express FC in heterologous hosts have faced limited success (4Roopashree S.D. Chai C., Ho, B. Ding J.L. Biochem. Mol. Biol Int. 1995; 35: 841-849PubMed Google Scholar, 5Roopashree S.D., Ho, B. Ding J.L. Mol. Mar. Biol. Biotech. 1996; 5: 334-343Google Scholar, 6Ding J.L.

The native signal peptide of FC directs this molecule to intracellular large granules of the limulus amoebocytes, and it is unable to secrete the protein out of heterologous expression hosts. Instead, it may serve as a membrane anchor and invariably result in membrane-bound recombinant protein. Thus, an alternative signal peptide is needed to obtain secreted FC for investigation of its domain-function relationship. Using a cross-host secretory signal (8Tan N.S., Ho, B. Ding J.L. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which leads to the secretion of various recombinant proteins in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems, we have recently produced full-length and biologically functional domains of FC that binds LPS (9Wang J., Ho, B. Ding J.L. Biotechnol. Lett. 2001; 23: 71-76Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 10Tan N.S., Ho, B. Ding J.L. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The LPS binding and enzymatic activity of Factor C are functionally distinct and are localized in the N-terminal sushi (ES) and C-terminal serine protease domains (SP), respectively (10Tan N.S., Ho, B. Ding J.L. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Tokunaga F. Miyata T. Nakamura T. Morita T. Kuma K. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the importance of interdomain interactions for expression and biological activity of FC is hitherto unknown. Of particular interest is the proline-rich region (PRR) of the FC protein. Proline residues contribute significantly to the conformation and rigidity of the protein structure, and PRR serves as a molecular hinge in a number of proteins (12Lozier J. Takahashi N. Putnam F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3640-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 13Battini J.L. Danos O. Heard J.M. J.

Nephrol. 1997; 8: 915-919PubMed Google Scholar), affecting protein-protein interaction and protein-ligand binding. In this study, we focus on the potential involvement of PRR in FC secretion and function. By systematic design of FC deletion homologues with and without PRR, we are able to examine their expression profile, post-translational modifications, localization, and LPS binding activity. N-Linked glycans play pivotal roles in protein folding, oligomerization, quality control, sorting, and transport (15Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2346-2349Crossref Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). These sugar chains are extensively involved in protein conformation and function (16Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). There are six potential N-glycosylation sites in FC at positions 523, 534, 624, 740, 767, and 912 (Fig. 1) (17Ding J.L. Navas III., M.A.A. Ho B. Mol. Mar. Biol. Biotech. 1995; 4: 90-103PubMed Google Scholar). However, the functions of these glycans has not been examined. We used glycosylation inhibition and site-directed mutagenesis to test the role of N-glycans on expression and secretion of FC and to map the most critical N-glycans. Further assessment on the involvement of N-glycans in the secretion pathway was performed by co-expression of FC with various molecular chaperones, which are proteins that assist in the correct noncovalent assembly of other polypeptide-containing structures (18Ellis R.J. Ellis R.J. Laskey R.A. Lorimer G.H. Molecular Chaperones. 1st Ed. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 1-5Crossref Google Scholar). We report for the first time that expression and secretion of such a multidomain serine protease requires the proper modular arrangement of the various domains, and PRR is essential for proper folding of the downstream SP domain. In addition, we demonstrated the importance of site-specific N-glycosylation in FC secretion and provided evidence that N-glycans interact with chaperones and hence manifest their effect on FC secretion. Interestingly, despite having proper protein folding, the secreted FC exhibited LPS binding but lacked enzymatic activity. This loss of LPS-induced enzymatic activity can be attributed to different complexity in glycosylation. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were of molecular biology grade, purchased from Sigma. Drosophila expression vector, pAc5.1/V5-HisA (Invitrogen) was used for fusion expression. The native signal peptide sequence of full-length (FL) FC cDNA was replaced by a novel secretion signal to direct the fusion protein out of theDrosophila cells. Seven expression plasmids were constructed, with various combinations of FC domains inserted downstream of secretory signal and upstream of V5 and His6fusion tag: FL, FL(−PRR), ES·PRR, ES, PRR·SP, SP, and SP·PRR. Fig. 1 depicts the domain structures of these recombinant constructs. Among the seven constructs, FL, ES·PRR, PRR·SP, and SP·PRR contain PRR. The remaining three constructs (FL(−PRR), ES, and SP) lack PRR. Only ES, which contains the N-terminal LPS-binding region, lacks both PRR and N-glycan sites.

Smeenk R.J.T. Unnasch T, R. Greene B.M. Hoch S.O. J. Immuol. 1991; 147: 3031-3039PubMed Google Scholar) cDNAs were subcloned into pAc5.1/V5-HisA. Site-directed mutagenesis of the N-glycan sites of FC was performed using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations were verified by sequencing. Plasmids were isolated using CsCl-ethidium bromide gradient ultracentrifugation. Drosophila S2 cells were maintained at 25 °C in DESTM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (CLONTECH). Calcium phosphate-mediated transient transfection was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Invitrogen). For stable transfection, pCoHYGRO selection plasmid was cotransfected with Factor C expression construct, selected with 350 μg/ml hygromycin for 4–6 weeks, and adapted to DESTM serum-free medium. For chaperone co-expression studies, Cellfectin-mediated (Invitrogen) transfection was performed with DNA mixture containing 1 μg each of FC and chaperone expression construct. Control transfections were performed with FC expression construct and parental pAc5.1/V5-HisA DNA instead of chaperone expression constructs. Two μl of trypsin solution (100 ng/μl) in 50 mmacetic acid was added into 200 μg of FC in 100 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3. The digestion was carried out at 4 °C. At time intervals, 10 μl of the reaction mixture was removed and terminated by 4 μl of the 4× SDS sample buffer. Western analysis was performed on the digested samples using polyclonal rabbit anti-FC antibody. Tunicamycin (TM) inhibits N-glycosylation of glycoproteins by blocking the first step in N-glycan biosynthesis, whereas α-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) and α-deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ) specifically inhibit α-glucosidase and α-mannosidase activities, respectively, thus blocking the conversion of high mannose oligosaccharides to complex-type oligosaccharides. S2 cells stably expressing FC were exposed to sublethal doses of TM (5 μ g/ml), DNJ (5 mm), and DMJ (2 mm). Proteins from treated cells were collected at 24 h and subjected to affinity chromatography on ConA-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Conditioned medium containing 10 μg/ml secreted FC and cell lysate protein containing 1 μg/μl cellular FC were incubated with one-fifth volume of ConA-Sepharose at 25 °C for 1.5 h. The unbound fraction containing aglycosylated FC was recovered by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min. The resin-bound glycosylated FC was dissociated via boiling for 5 min in 3 resin volumes of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Both fractions were subjected to Western analysis. S2 cells co-transfected with FC and chaperone expression plasmids were collected on day 5 post-transfection and washed twice with 1.0 ml of PBS. Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (0.1× PBS, 1.0 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 μm aprotinin), sheared seven times through a 27-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatant containing the cell lysate (L) proteins was retrieved. The pelleted membranes (P) were solubilized in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% digitonin for 30 min at 4 °C with occasional agitation. The samples were clarified at 14,000 × gfor 15 min to separate aggregates from solubilized proteins, which were used for subsequent immunoprecipitation. Fifty μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was incubated with 50 μl of PBS containing 2 μl of anti-V5 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, 100 μl of solubilized protein samples was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight on a rotator. The samples were centrifuged and washed three times with cold PBS. Forty μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added to each tube and boiled for 5 min before Western analysis. Culture medium containing secreted FC was collected after centrifugation of cell culture at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Medium was concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration using a regenerated cellulose membrane cassette (Pellicon XL; 30-kDa molecular mass cut-off; Millipore Corp.) at 4 °C. Concentrated protein sample was chromatographed on a Sephadex G-100 (1.5 × 90-cm) column. Fractions containing partially purified FC were pooled and concentrated using Centriprep-regenerated cellulose membrane (30-kDa molecular mass cut-off; Amicon YM). 10 μg each of partially purified secreted FC from Sf9-BEVS and S2 was denatured in 5% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 100 °C and subjected to endoglycosidase H and peptide:N-glycanase F (New England Biolabs) digestion at 37 °C for 16 h, followed by Western analysis using anti-FC antibody. Control samples were treated in the same way except in the absence of enzyme. For the glycan differentiation assay, FCs from LAL, CAL, Sf9-BEVS, and S2 were purified by protein A-FC antibody affinity chromatography. Fifty μl of protein A-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) was incubated with 50 μl of PBS containing 10 μl of anti-FC antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. 100 μg of FC samples were then added to the protein A-Sepharose complex and incubated at 4 °C overnight on a rotator. The samples were centrifuged and washed three times with PBS, and FC was recovered from protein A-Sepharose by boiling for 10 min in PBS. Lectin binding assay of the immunoaffinity-purified FCs was carried out using the DIG glycan differentiation kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The LPS binding potential of various FC proteins were analyzed using (a) LPS ELISA-based assay and (b) surface plasmon resonance (SPR). This assay was performed as described by Tan et al. (10Tan N.S., Ho, B. Ding J.L. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Coating of a polysorp 96-well plate (NUNC) was achieved by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, and blocking was performed overnight at 25 °C. 10 μg of protein sample was added into each well and incubated for 16 h at 25 °C. Bound FCs were detected by sequential incubation with primary rabbit anti-FC antibody (1:500 dilution, 3 h at 37 °C) and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Dako). Anti-V5 antibody at 20 μg/ml was immobilized to CM5 chip (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's specifications. A low capacity coating for kinetic study was achieved as indicated by an increase of 1418 resonance units. FC samples were injected at 10 μl/min over the anti-V5 antibody surface, resulting in capture of 5.0 pmol of FC (determined by densitometric scanning using pure ES as standard and normalized based on their peptide size) from the conditioned medium. Subsequently, lipid A at five different concentrations was injected at 20 μl/min to examine interaction between FC and lipid A. The affinity constant was calculated using BIAevaluation program (version 3.0.2) and reconfirmed using CLAMP (21Myszka D.G. Morton T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 149-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). For regeneration, 100 mm NaOH was used. Values represent the mean of three independent experiments. Seven expression plasmids were transfected into S2 cells. Immunoblot analysis shows that all the stable S2 transfectants expressed FCs, albeit displaying different amounts and expression profiles (Fig. 1 A). Interestingly, although subcloned downstream of a potent secretion signal, not all of the FC proteins were secreted, suggesting that the localization of FCs might be signal sequence-independent. We observed that the FL could be detected in the culture medium. However, the deletion of PRR from FL, yielding FL(−PRR), is not secreted (Fig.1 A, constructs 1 and 2). This indicates that PRR is important for the secretion competency of FCs. We next investigated the relative contribution of PRR to the functionally distinct LPS-binding and serine protease domains, using paired truncated FCs (ES·PRR versus ES and PRR·SPversus SP) containing or lacking the PRR (Fig.1 A). Neither the preservation nor the removal of PRR affects the secretion competency of the LPS-binding domain, ES (ES·PRR and ES; Fig. 1 A, constructs 3 and4). Similarly, when PRR was localized upstream of SP (PRR·SP), as in the native FC, the PRR·SP protein was easily detectable in the medium. Interestingly, when the PRR was deleted, the serine protease domain alone (SP) is no longer detectable in the culture medium (Fig. 1 A, constructs 5and 6). This clearly indicates that PRR is critical for the secretion of the serine protease domain. A major difference between secreted and cellular FCs that harbor SP was that the secreted FCs (FL and PRR·SP) have the PRR domain localized upstream of SP, without which SP is not secreted into the medium. To verify the importance of this modular arrangement between PRR and SP, the PRR was subcloned C-terminal to SP (SP·PRR). The PRR domain in this reciprocal construct was not able to rescue the intracellular retention of SP·PRR. Taken together, the PRR region of FC is important for correct folding of the downstream SP domain and that intracellularly localized FCs might be misfolded. To shed more light on the role of PRR in folding of the downstream SP domain, partial tryptic digestion followed by Western analysis was carried out on two pairs of FCs: (a) FL and FL(-PRR) and (b) PRR·SP and SP. Over the observed time, distinct protein fragments of FL (132, 80, 52, and 38 kDa) and fragments of PRR·SP (56, 52, and 38 kDa) were clearly detectable by anti-FC antibody (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that they were properly folded into a series of individual compact domains, which are relatively trypsin-resistant. It is interesting to note that two of the tryptic fragments, 80 and 52 kDa, corresponded to LPS-activated autocleavage of Factor C. Importantly, both PRR-deficient mutants, FL(−PRR) and SP, were rapidly digested by trypsin and were not detectable by anti-FC antibody after 1 h. Two isoforms of SP, of ∼38 kDa, were observed, of which the larger isoform was rapidly digested by trypsin. Interestingly, the minor smaller isoform increased slightly over the tested time period. This increase could be generated from a small subpopulation of the larger isoform, and the smaller isoform was relatively resistant to trypsin digestion. These results show differences in protein folding between intracellular PRR-deficient FCs and secretion-competent FCs. It is envisaged that lack of PRR upstream of the SP domain tends to result in misfolded FCs, which expose more accessible trypsin cleavage sites that render them more susceptible to protease digestion. Clearly, PRR is important for the folding and, hence, secretion of the serine protease. Essentially, PRR can only exert its effect when the serine protease domain is localized downstream of it. We also observed a differential dependence of the two functional domains (viz. LPS-binding and serine protease domains) on PRR for folding and secretion (Fig. 1). The secretion competence of LPS-binding ES is unaffected by PRR, which is in contrast to the SP. A distinguishing feature of ES is that it lacksN-glycosylation sites compared with SP or other SP-harboring FCs, which contain multiple N-glycosylation sites. Thus, we next investigated the significance of N-glycosylation on the expression and secretion of FC. The secreted FL protein is glycosylated and is able to bind to ConA-Sepharose (data not shown). FL proteins from S2 cells treated with TM show progressively decreasing size based on their mobility (Fig.2 A), suggesting a loss ofN-linked sugar chains. Aglycosylated FL was detected only in the L and P fractions, which clearly indicates that loss ofN-glycosylation inhibited FL secretion. The absence ofN-glycosylation of FL after TM treatment is also confirmed by its inability to bind ConA-Sepharose (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to the effects of TM on FC secretion, cells treated with DNJ and DMJ exhibited no difference in expression level or distribution pattern of FCs (data not shown). Thus, the conversion of high mannose oligosaccharide to complex oligosaccharide is dispensable for protein secretion. To determine the critical N-glycan sites, a series of glycomutations were introduced (Table I). The position of PRR is such that it partitioned the FL into the N-terminal LPS-binding and the C-terminal serine protease regions. Thus, we decided to mutate the N-glycosylation sites sequentially from each terminal. Single disruption of any one of the six N-glycan sites has no observable impact on the FC secretion (Fig. 2 C, Series I). However, the elimination of two sites, particularly N523Q/N534Q and N767Q/N912Q, impaired the expression of FL (Fig. 2 C,lanes 1 and 5 of Series II). Although mutation of the three consecutiveN-glycan sites located at the N terminus caused drastic reduction of the expression of FC, this mutant FL is still secreted into the culture medium (Fig. 2 C, lane 1 of Series III). In contrast and importantly, the mutation of the three consecutive C-terminalN-glycan sites located downstream of PRR at/near the SP domain totally abolished the secretion (Fig. 2 C,lane 2 of Series III). The removal of all six glycosylation sites (i.e. aglycosylated FL) is not secretion-competent (Fig. 2 C, Series IV). Thus, in addition to PRR, theN-glycosylation sites in the SP are also critical for protein expression and secretion. We next sought to assess the contribution of N-glycans to secretion competence and also to determine a possible functional dependence on PRR.Table IGlycomutants of Factor C generated by site-directed mutagenesisMutantConsensus sequence(s) disruptedSeries I FC mutantsN523QAsn-523N534QAsn-534N624QAsn-624N740QAsn-740N767QAsn-767N912QAsn-912Series II FC mutantsN523Q/N534QAsn-523 and Asn-534N534Q/N624QAsn-534 and Asn-624N624Q/N740QAsn-624 and Asn-740N740Q/N767QAsn-740 and Asn-767N767Q/N912QAsn-767 and Asn-912Series III FC mutantsN523Q/N534Q/N624QAsn-523, Asn-534, and Asn-624N740Q/N767Q/N912QAsn-740, Asn-767, and Asn-912Series IV FC mutantN1–6QAll six sites Open table in a new tab To further examine the involvement ofN-glycans in the secretion pathway, co-expression study of FC with two molecular chaperones was carried out. cCNX and hCRT were expressed in S2 cells and their expected protein sizes and cellular localization were detected with their respective antibodies. The expression levels of the cCNX and hCRT in S2 were also comparable (Fig.2 D). The overall expression level of FL, as determined by densitometric scanning of the immunoblot, increased over time, and peaked between 5 and 7 days (data not shown). cCNX caused a 3-fold increase in the level of secreted FL, whereas hCRT minimally enhanced FL expression. Next, the effects of chaperone on the expression level of cellular FCs lacking PRR, FL(−PRR) and SP, were examined. Although overexpression of cCNX and hCRT enhanced the solubility of FL(−PRR) and SP to variable degrees (Fig. 2 E), none of these chaperones was able to rescue the nonsecretion of PRR-deficient FCs: FL(−PRR) and SP. The chaperones did not affect ES expression and secretion. This is not surprising, since the LPS-binding ES domain is not glycosylated (Fig.2 E). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that cCNX co-precipitated with FL(−PRR) and SP (Fig. 2 F,left panel), but no apparent interaction was observed with hCRT (data not shown). Since hCRT consistently gives a small increase in FC expression, it is conceivable that the association between FC and hCRT is transient. Specific interaction between theN-glycans of FC and cCNX was further confirmed usingN-glycosylation inhibitors, TM, DNJ, and DMJ. Consistent with the above observation, treatment with TM and DNJ abolished the interaction between FC and cCNX, whereas DMJ had no effect (Fig.2 F, right panel). This clearly indicates that the N-glycans on the FC molecules are responsible for interaction with cCNX. In addition, cCNX probably recognizes certain structures of FC N-glycans and binds specifically to the deglucosylated form of FC. Taken together, the results indicate that N-glycans are important for interaction with cCNX, which increases the solubility of the FC protein, and that its observed effect on protein secretion is secondary to the lack of this interaction. Furthermore, the PRR region, although critical for the correct conformation of the downstream serine protease domain, is dispensable for the interaction with these chaperones. In addition to its contribution to protein solubility,N-glycans have been reported to influence protein functions (16Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 321-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Since glycosylation is the only post-translational modification known so far in FCs, we attempted to precisely investigate the extent and type of glycosylation in FC that can alter LPS-induced autocleavage and its enzymatic activity. Sf9-BEVS FC was previously demonstrated to exhibit LPS-induced cleavage and enzymatic activity (22Ding J.L. Ho B. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 277-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase H and peptide:N-glycanase F digestion analyses show the presence of both high mannose and complex glycans on S2 FC and Sf9-BEVS FC. Differences in their mobility indicate that Sf9-BEVS FC contains 12 kDa of complex N-glycans and S2 FC harbors 8 kDa of complex N-glycans (Fig.3 A). Thus, it appears that S2 FC is less glycolytically processed. Galanthus nivalisagglutinin treatment reveals the presence of high mannose glycans in all four FCs. Sambucus nigra agglutinin treatment yielded positive results for FCs from LAL, CAL, and Sf9-BEVS and only weakly reacted with S2 FC. Interestingly, reaction withMaackia amurensis agglutinin yielded the strongest signal with S2 FC, pointing to a difference in the branching of terminal sialic acids. S2 FC contain greater sialic acid linked α(2–3) to galactose, which is in contrast to Sf9-BEVS FC, LAL, and CAL. The latter three FCs contain more sialic acid linked α(2–6) to galactose. In agreement with the endoglycosidase H digestion results,Datura stramonium agglutinin yielded the weakest signal with S2 FC, confirming that S2 FC is the most poorly processed among the four FCs (Fig. 3 B). Collectively, we have shown that the glycan structures of FC expressed in S2 are different from FCs derived from Sf9, CAL, and LAL. Such differences in glycomodifications can translate into disparity in protein functions. LPS activation of the FC expressed in the Sf9-baculovirus expression system was cleaved into two protein fragments of 80 and 52 kDa (Fig. 3 C), with resultant enzymatic activity (22Ding J.L. Ho B. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 277-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, attempts at measuring LPS-inducible enzymatic activity of S2 FC showed that it does not autocleave and exhibited no enzymatic activity. The above mentioned host cell-specific comp"

It is well documented that interactions between Mediator and activators facilitate transcription, possibly by recruiting RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) to promoters (5Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev.

Accordingly, Mediator increases the efficiency with which the Pol II large subunit C-terminal domain (CTD) is phosphorylated during transcription (3Kim Y.-J. Björklund S., Li, Y. Sayre M.H.

Most individual Mediator subunits are not conserved between yeast and metazoans, possibly because they interact with divergent activators and repressors, and Mediator complexes that have different subunit compositions have been identified in mammals (5Myers L.C.

Mediator changes conformation upon binding to Pol II and is induced to adopt distinct conformations by different activators (13Asturias F.J. Jiang Y.W. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1999; 283: 985-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 14Taatjes D.J. Naar A.M. Andel III, F. Nogales E. Tjian R. Science. 2002; 295: 1058-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), suggesting that conformational effects may integrate positive and repressive stimuli to regulate Mediator or Pol II activity. Multiple Mediator components have been implicated in specific activation or repression events, and even various conserved Mediator subunits seem to have specialized functions. For example, in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo the conserved Mediator components MED-6, MED-7, and MED-8 do not appear to be required for expression of many genes or for formation of some differentiated cell types (15Kwon J.Y. Park J.M. Gim B.S. Han S.J. Lee J. Kim Y.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14990-14995Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of Mediator during transcription, it is important to identify Mediator components that might have broadly essential and possibly conserved functions. The Rgr1 subunit is conserved in yeast and mammalian Mediator complexes (see Fig. 1A) (5Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 6Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Within the yeast Mediator, Rgr1 is required for attachment of the Sin4·Gal11 subcomplex, which has been implicated in positive or negative regulation of specific genes (16Li Y. Björklund S. Jiang Y.W. Kim Y.J. Lane W.S. Stillman D.J. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10864-10868Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 17Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14307-14310Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, Rgr1 is present within a larger Mediator subcomplex that has multiple other components that appear to have activator-specific functions (19Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Gim B.S. Ryu G.H. Park S.J. Lane W.S. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Han S.J. Lee J.S. Kang J.S. Kim Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37020-37026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Yeast Rgr1 associates with certain repressors and is required for repression of particular genes (21Covitz P.A. Song W. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1994; 138: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jiang Y.W. Dohrmann P.R. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 1995; 140: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Null rgr1 mutants are inviable however, and rgr1 is required for activation of metal-induced genes (23Lee D.K. Kim S. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2934-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), consistent with Rgr1 additionally having positive roles. These observations raise the question of whether Rgr1 performs a specific set of activation and repression functions or is a broadly essential factor with a critical mechanistic role in yeast and metazoans as might be predicted by its conservation. We have used RNA interference (RNAi) to investigate requirements forC. elegans rgr-1 for transcription in the developing embryo. Because early C. elegans development is initiated by maternal gene products, C. elegans embryonic cells survive until approximately the 100-cell stage in the absence of new mRNA transcription, making it possible to manipulate expression of even generally essential transcription factors in these living cells (24Powell-Coffman J.A. Knight J. Wood W.B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar,25Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We found that in rgr-1(RNAi) embryos, phosphorylation of both Ser-5 and Ser-2 of the CTD repeat is undetectable, development arrests with a phenotype that is consistent with a broad inhibition of transcription, and expression of multiple reporter genes that are representative of various gene classes is dramatically reduced. We conclude that RGR-1 may be more broadly required for transcription than any Mediator subunit studied so far and that the RGR-1 Mediator subcomplex plays a generally critical role early during the transcription cycle prior to phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD. C. elegans strains were maintained as described previously (25Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The wild type strain was N2. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter strains were provided to us as cited previously (25Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The C. elegans rgr-1 ortholog was identified by searching WORMpep and genomic databases (Sanger Centre) with human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein sequences. Alignments were produced by Megalign (DNAStar). A rabbit antiserum was raised against the RGR-1 peptide PSVGQSYHHPLHHQQYPPQ with an amino-terminal Cys added and then affinity-purified (Pierce). For RGR-1 and α-Pol II staining, freeze-cracked embryos were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and then in methanol and washed with PBT (1× phosphate buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin) prior to staining with affinity-purified RGR-1 antiserum. RGR-1 antibody staining was competed by the immunogenic but not heterologous peptides (not shown). Staining was performed with the P-CTD (α-PSer5) (26Schroeder S.C. Schwer B. Shuman S. Bentley D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2435-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and H5 (α-PSer2) (Babco) antibodies as in Ref. 27Seydoux G. Dunn M.A. Development. 1997; 124: 2191-2201PubMed Google Scholar. For GFP analysis, embryos were transferred to 2% agarose pads. Images were captured with a Zeiss AxioSKOP2 microscope and AxioCam digital camera, and GFP or antibody staining intensities were compared over a range of exposure times. Pixel intensities were standardized using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. Confocal images were obtained with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 MP multiphoton microscope and processed using Confocal Assistant 4.02 and Photoshop 5.5. An rgr-1 cDNA (yk331b4) was obtained from Yuji Kohara (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). Sense and antisense RNA was synthesized using the Ribomax kit (Promega) and then annealed and injected at 1.0 μg/μl into young adults (containing two to eight embryos). Embryos were collected for analysis at least 19 h later when uniform populations of terminally arrested rgr-1(RNAi) embryos were being produced. For heat shock, thesehsp-16.2::gfp embryos were incubated at 37 °C for 1 min in 10 μl of M9, and then fluorescence was examined an hour later. rgr-1 RNA was assayed in total embryonic RNA by RT-PCR using the SuperscriptTM One StepTMsystem (Invitrogen) as described in Ref. 28Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar. rgr-1oligonucleotides used for RT-PCR were CCTTGAAGCTGCTGAACCAAGATTAGAAGTG and CCTCCAACTGAATGAACTGAGCTCGGTCTCC. TheC. elegans genome encodes a single well conserved ortholog of yeast rgr1 and its human counterpart DRIP150/TRAP170 (Fig. 1A). C. elegans rgr-1 re-identified these human and yeast genes as its closest relatives in the GenBankTM databases (not shown). To determine whether the RGR-1 protein is present in the early C. elegans embryo, we examined its expression by antibody staining. Using conditions optimized for early embryos, RGR-1 was readily apparent in embryonic nuclei beginning at the two-cell stage (Fig.1B and not shown). RGR-1 was also detectable in adult germ line nuclei (not shown), suggesting that it is maternally expressed. When rgr-1 expression was inhibited in the early embryo by RNAi, RGR-1 antibody staining was reduced to background (Fig.1B), and the rgr-1 mRNA was not detected by RT-PCR (not shown), suggesting that the rgr-1 mRNA and protein were significantly depleted. When the Pol II large subunit geneama-1 or other broadly essential mRNA transcription factors are inhibited by RNAi, C. elegans embryos arrest development after forming ∼100 cells that lack any signs of differentiation (Fig. 1C) (24Powell-Coffman J.A. Knight J. Wood W.B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). A similar early developmental arrest occurred in rgr-1(RNAi) embryos, consistent with a broad transcription block (Fig. 1C). To investigate whether this phenotype involved a general defect in maternal mRNA stores, we monitored early cell division patterns and performed parallel experiments in a transgenic strain that expresses a fusion of the maternally derived germ line protein PIE-1 to GFP. PIE-1::GFP recapitulates the endogenous PIE-1 localization pattern, which depends upon at least 20 maternal genes (29Reese K.J. Dunn M.A. Waddle J.A. Seydoux G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As inama-1(RNAi) embryos, in rgr-1(RNAi) embryos maternal PIE-1::GFP expression and localization patterns appeared normal at every stage (Fig. 1D and not shown). Early cell division timing and cleavage planes were also generally normal in rgr-1(RNAi) embryos except for the cell cycle period of the two E cell daughters (E2 cells), which give rise to the endoderm. When early embryonic mRNA transcription is broadly inhibited, as in ama-1(RNAi) embryos, the E2 cell cycle length is shortened from 45 to ∼22 min (24Powell-Coffman J.A. Knight J. Wood W.B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The E2 cells similarly divided after 22 min in rgr-1(RNAi)embryos (not shown). Together our findings suggest that depletion of embryonic RGR-1 does not detectably affect maternal mRNA stores but may broadly impair new mRNA transcription. To investigate how mRNA transcription was affected in rgr-1(RNAi) embryos, we first analyzed phosphorylation of the Pol II large subunit CTD, which consists of repeats based on the consensus YSPTSPS (42 copies in C. elegans). Pol II is recruited to promoters in an unphosphorylated form, and then during transcription the CTD repeat is initially phosphorylated on Ser-5 by the TFIIH kinase (26Schroeder S.C. Schwer B. Shuman S. Bentley D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2435-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 30Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). During transcription elongation the distribution of CTD phosphorylation shifts to Ser-2 (30Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 31Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), which in metazoans is phosphorylated by the kinase CDK-9 (28Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 32Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). CTD Ser-5 and Ser-2 phosphorylation can be specifically detected in embryonic nuclei by staining with the P-CTD and H5 antibodies, respectively (25Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Schroeder S.C. Schwer B. Shuman S. Bentley D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2435-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 27Seydoux G. Dunn M.A. Development. 1997; 124: 2191-2201PubMed Google Scholar), which we refer to as α-PSer5 and α-PSer2 for clarity (Fig.2A). In early vertebrate embryos, CTD phosphorylation that occurs independently of transcription is detectable by Western blotting (33Bellier S. Dubois M.F. Nishida E. Almouzni G. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1434-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 34Palancade B. Bellier S. Almouzni G. Bensaude O. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2483-2489PubMed Google Scholar, 35Palancade B. Dubois M.F. Dahmus M.E. Bensaude O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6359-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but in the C. elegans embryo the presence of both α-PSer5 and α-PSer2 staining appears to depend upon transcription. Staining with the α-PSer5 and α-PSer2 antibodies is not detected in embryonic nuclei until the three-to-four-cell stage when new mRNA transcription begins (27Seydoux G. Dunn M.A. Development. 1997; 124: 2191-2201PubMed Google Scholar). At later stages, the patterns and intensity of this staining appear to parallel transcription activity in embryonic cells, and both types of staining are reduced to background levels when the essential initiation factor TFIIB (ttb-1) is depleted by RNAi (25Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Seydoux G. Dunn M.A. Development. 1997; 124: 2191-2201PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, when the elongation factor CDK-9 is depleted by RNAi, Ser-5 phosphorylation levels appear normal, but Ser-2 phosphorylation is undetectable (28Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In rgr-1(RNAi) embryos, levels of the Pol II large subunit AMA-1 appeared to be unaffected (Fig. 1B), but phosphorylation of both Ser-5 and Ser-2 of the CTD was dramatically reduced. Ser-5 phosphorylation is detectable as a bright punctate α-PSer5 staining pattern in transcriptionally active wild type somatic nuclei (Fig. 2A) but is confined to two foci in the transcriptionally silent early germ line precursor (Fig.2B). In contrast, in rgr-1(RNAi) embryos α-PSer5 staining was reduced to background levels in all cells at each embryonic stage, and the two characteristic staining foci were absent from germ line cells (Fig. 2A and not shown). Specific α-PSer2 staining is normally apparent in all wild type somatic cells and absent in the early germ line (27Seydoux G. Dunn M.A. Development. 1997; 124: 2191-2201PubMed Google Scholar) but was not detectable in any cells in rgr-1(RNAi) embryos (Fig.2A and not shown). These dramatic defects in phosphorylation of both CTD serines suggest that depletion of RGR-1 may broadly impair transcription and may interfere with an early step during the transcription process. To investigate the importance of RGR-1 for expression of individual genes, we performed RNAi experiments in C. elegans strains that carry reporter transgenes in which regulatory regions are intact and coding regions are fused to GFP. These reporters are expressed in the early embryo in parallel to the corresponding endogenous genes. We first examined expression of med-1 and pes-10, each of which is expressed as transcription initiates (Fig.2C). In rgr-1(RNAi) embryos, PES-10::GFP and MED-1::GFP expression was reduced to very low background levels that were characteristic ofama-1(RNAi) embryos (Fig. 2C). rgr-1was similarly required to express the heat shock genehsp-16.2 (Fig. 2C), the endodermal specification gene end-1, and the broadly expressed genes sur-5and cki-2 (Table I). Inrgr-1(RNAi) embryos, some genes were expressed at levels that were significantly reduced but above background. This last group of genes included the developmental specification genespha-4 and elt-5 and the widely expressed genelet-858 (Fig. 2C and Table I). The finding thatrgr-1 is required for appropriate expression of this diverse group of genes supports the model that RGR-1 is broadly important for transcription in the early C. elegans embryo.Table Irgr-1 required for early embryonic gene expressionELT-5::GFP (ectoderm)CKI-2::GFP (cell cycle)SUR-5::GFP (MAP kinase pathway)END-1::GFP (endoderm)LET-858::GFP (conserved eukaryotic)WT+++++ama-1(RNAi)−−−−−rgr-1(RNAi)−/+−−−−/+ Open table in a new tab Previous analyses implicated yeast rgr1 in repression of particular genes and in activation of metal-induced genes (21Covitz P.A. Song W. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1994; 138: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jiang Y.W. Dohrmann P.R. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 1995; 140: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lee D.K. Kim S. Lis J.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2934-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but it had not been determined in any organism whether Rgr1 performs a generally essential Mediator function. Here we have obtained multiple lines of evidence that rgr-1 is critical for most transcription in the developing C. elegans embryo. Similarly to ama-1(RNAi) embryos, rgr-1(RNAi) embryos arrested development without apparent differentiation and lacked detectable Pol II CTD phosphorylation (Figs. 1C and2A). In addition, it is striking that inrgr-1(RNAi) embryos each of the wide variety of embryonic genes tested was expressed at significantly reduced levels (Fig.2C and Table I). The finding that some embryonic genes were expressed detectably in rgr-1(RNAi) embryos (Fig.2C and Table I) may suggest some specialization in RGR-1 function but could derive from an incomplete RNAi effect. Despite this caveat, our findings strongly indicate that RGR-1 is broadly required for transcription and is therefore likely to be essential for most Mediator functions. An intriguing aspect of our findings is that phosphorylation of both Ser-2 and Ser-5 of the CTD was reduced to undetectable levels inrgr-1(RNAi) embryos (Fig. 2A). A similar reduction in levels of both CTD phosphoserines occurred when the initiation factor TFIIB was inhibited by RNAi (25Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, RNAi depletion of TAF-4, the homolog of the human TFIID component TAFII130 (36Tora L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), broadly inhibited Ser-2 phosphorylation but was associated with each somatic cell containing two bright and distinct α-PSer5 foci (25Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These foci appeared similar to those characteristic of the transcriptionally silent germ line (Fig.2B) and may have derived from aborted or stalled transcription events. Significantly, although this Ser-5 phosphorylation occurred, taf-4(RNAi) embryos were characterized by a more complete inhibition of reporter gene expression than rgr-1(RNAi) embryos (25Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that lack of RGR-1 may inhibit most transcription before Ser-5 phosphorylation occurs and at an earlier step than transcription is blocked in the absence of TAF-4. These conclusions are consistent with the model that Mediator is generally required at an early step during Pol II recruitment or transcription initiation. The broad requirement for rgr-1 that we have observed is particularly striking because the metazoan Mediator components studied to date each appear to be essential for activation of a limited subgroup of genes (5Myers L.C. Kornberg R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 729-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 6Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem.

A. 1999; 96: 14990-14995Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In yeast, even the broadly required Mediator subunit Srb4 appears to be dispensable for heat- and metal-induced genes in contrast to yeast and C. elegans rgr-1 (Fig. 2C) (17Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Our model that RGR-1 is broadly critical for transcription provides a paradigm for explaining why some yeast rgr1 mutations abrogate the effects of certain transcriptional repressors (21Covitz P.A. Song W. Mitchell A.P. Genetics. 1994; 138: 577-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jiang Y.W. Dohrmann P.R. Stillman D.J. Genetics. 1995; 140: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because it is consistent with the view that these repressors may block transcription by interfering with a critical positive aspect of Rgr1 function. It is possible that RGR-1 is critical for Mediator function because it is important for Mediator structural integrity. RGR-1 may be required for the presence of multiple Mediator subunits that have more specialized activities, a possibility that is consistent with Mediator structures (13Asturias F.J. Jiang Y.W. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1999; 283: 985-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18Dotson M.R. Yuan C.X. Roeder R.G. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Jiang Y.W., Li, Y.

Alternatively, RGR-1 might be required for an essential conformational effect, enzymatic activity, or interaction at the promoter. In either case, our findings indicate that further analysis of RGR-1 functions will elucidate fundamental principles of how Mediator complexes contribute to transcription.

This represents a novel mechanism for alcohol dehydrogenase activity regulation. Methanol is formed in large quantities in mineralization processes in nature, mostly from degradation of methylesters and -ethers that occur in plants (pectin and lignin). Methylotrophic microorganisms growing on methanol as carbon and energy sources can be isolated readily from soil. They possess a special set of enzymes for generation of energy from methanol oxidation and for synthesis of compounds with carbon–carbon bonds from methanol (1Anthony C.

Yeasts employ an alcohol oxidase with FAD as cofactor (a flavoprotein); oxygen is used as electron acceptor, resulting in hydrogen peroxide formation. This enzyme is located in peroxisomes, an organel that also contains catalase activity (3Harder W. Veenhuis M. Rose A.H. Harrison J.S. The Yeasts. Academic Press, London1989: 289-316Google Scholar).

Gram-positive bacteria (bacilli and actinomycetes) employ cytoplasmic MDH enzymes with NAD(P)+as cofactor (nicotinoproteins), constituting novel NAD(P)+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases with unusual properties (6Reid M.F.

Pure cultures of obligately aerobic, thermotolerant Bacillus methanolicus strains grow rapidly in methanol mineral medium (doubling times 40–80 min) at temperatures of 35–60 °C and are tolerant to very high methanol concentrations (9Arfman N.

Dijkhuizen L. Frank J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Each MDH subunit contains 1 Zn2+-ion and 1–2 Mg2+-ions (13Vonck J. Arfman N. de Vries G.E. Van Beeumen J. van Bruggen E.F. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3949-3954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Zinc is commonly found in the active site of alcohol dehydrogenases, but the presence of magnesium had not been reported before. Each subunit also contains a tightly (but noncovalently) bound NAD(H) molecule, which is oxidized and reduced by methanol and formaldehyde, respectively, and thus functions as a cofactor (17Arfman N. Hektor H.J. Bystrykh L.V. Govorukhina N.I. Dijkhuizen L. Frank J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). NAD+ plays two important roles in the MDH-catalyzed reaction: the MDH-bound NAD+cofactor serves as the primary electron acceptor in the alcohol dehydrogenase reaction, and exogenous NAD+ coenzyme is responsible for reoxidation of the MDH-bound NADH cofactor. MDH obeys a Ping-Pong type of reaction mechanism, consistent with such a temporary parking of reducing equivalents at the MDH-bound NAD(H) cofactor (17Arfman N. Hektor H.J. Bystrykh L.V. Govorukhina N.I. Dijkhuizen L. Frank J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This is very different from typical NAD+coenzyme-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases, which follow a ternary complex type of reaction mechanism (6Reid M.F. Fewson C.A. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 20: 13-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Studies with purified proteins showed that MDH activity with C1–C4 primary alcohols and its affinity for exogenous NAD+ and alcohol substrates are strongly increased in the presence of a B. methanolicus strain C1-soluble M r 50,000 activator (ACT) protein. Activation, which takes place within 1 s upon the addition of saturating amounts of ACT, requires the presence of Mg2+-ions. Spectral studies showed that Mg2+-ions are essential for the formation of an MDH·ACT·NAD+·Mg2+ complex. At physiological methanol concentrations (0.1–1.0 mm), the methanol turnover rate of MDH in vitro was increased up to 40-fold by the ACT protein (16Arfman N. Van Beeumen J. de Vries G.E. Harder W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3955-3960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Synthesis of the MDH and ACT proteins in B. methanolicus is regulated coordinately (14Arfman N. de Vries K.J. Moezelaar H.R. Attwood M.M. Robinson G.K. van Geel M. Dijkhuizen L. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 157: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here we report a molecular, biochemical, and functional characterization of the ACT protein of B. methanolicus strain C1. ACT is a member of the Nudix hydrolase family, that display hydrolytic activity with substrates containing anucleotide diphosphate group linked to some other moiety (x) (18Bessman M.J. Frick D.N. O'Handley S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25059-25062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). ACT protein stimulates coenzyme NAD+-dependent MDH activity by hydrolytic removal of the NMN(H) part of the NAD(H) cofactor in MDH protein. B. methanolicus strain C1 cells were grown as described (11de Vries G.E. Arfman N. Terpstra P. Dijkhuizen L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5346-5353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strains MC1061 and JM109, serving as hosts for genetic modifications and heterologous gene expression, respectively, were grown on LB medium (19Sambrook J. Frisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and when appropriate, ampicillin (100 mg.l−1) was added. The primers used were: A1, 5′-GGCGAATTCAA(A/G)TT(A/G)TT(T/C)GA(A/G)GA(A/G)AA(A/G)AC-3′, and A2, 5′-GGCTGATCATC(C/ T/A)AC(T/C)TG(T/C)AA(T/C)TT(C/T/A) AC(C/T/A)AC-3′. These were based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the ACT protein (16Arfman N. Van Beeumen J. de Vries G.E. Harder W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3955-3960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their degree of degeneration was limited based on codon bias of B. methanolicus (11de Vries G.E. Arfman N. Terpstra P. Dijkhuizen L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5346-5353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primer A3 consisted of an EcoRI site followed by the first 19 nucleotides of the act gene: 5′-GCGGAATTCATGGGAA- AATTATTTGAGG-3′. The antisense primer A4 contained a BamHI site and the last 18 nucleotides ofact: 5′-CGCGGATCCTCATTTATGTTTGAGAGC-3′. The KS and SK primers used are available commercially (Stratagene, Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands). Primer positions are shown in Fig.1. DNA amplification reactions were performed with Vent-DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Reaction mixtures (100 ml) contained: enzyme buffer (New England Biolabs), dNTP (50 mm/nucleotide), primers (0.5 mm/primer), target DNA (1–10 ng). Target DNA was incubated for 5 min at 94 °C before adding polymerase. Amplification conditions were: 25 reaction cycles at temperatures for denaturation, primer annealing and primer extension of 94, 45, and 72 °C, respectively. In the last reaction cycle, the primer extension time was set at 5 min. Plasmid pHK1 was constructed by cloning the PCR product of primers A1/A2, with B. methanolicus chromosomal DNA as template, in pBlueScriptIIKS (Stratagene). Plasmid pHK83 contains a 4.4-kb insert of B. methanolicus chromosomal DNA in thePstI site of pBlueScriptIIKS. Plasmid pHK105 was constructed by cloning the act gene in the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pProk1 (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, AC) with act expression controlled by the pProk1 tac promoter. B. methanolicus strain C1 total chromosomal DNA was isolated as described (11de Vries G.E. Arfman N. Terpstra P. Dijkhuizen L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5346-5353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methods for DNA handling, modification, and cloning were performed as described previously (19Sambrook J. Frisch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA of B. methanolicus was digested withPstI, and fragments ranging from 3.7 to 5.1 kb were isolated, ligated in pBlueScriptIIKS, and transformed to E. coli MC1061. This partial gene library sequence was screened using primers A1/A2. 40 × 250 pooled E. coli MC1061 colonies were transferred from agar plates to liquid LB medium and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. Samples from these 40 cultures were lysed by boiling for 5 min and subjected to DNA amplification. Cultures giving a positive amplification signal were plated, and 400 colonies were screened in pools of 20 colonies. Finally, individual colonies were screened for a positive amplification signal. Nucleotide sequencing was done using dye-primers in the cycle sequencing method (20Murray V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8889Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) with the Thermosequenase kit RPN 2538 fromAmersham Biosciences. The samples were run on the ALF-Express sequencing robot. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence (deposited in the GenBankTM data base under accession number AY128667) was done using CloneManager, Version 4.01. Protein sequence comparisons were performed using the facilities of the BLAST server (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar) at NCBI (National Library of Medicine, Washington, D. C.). Cells were disrupted by two passages through a French pressure cell operating at 1.4 × 105kilonewtons.m−2. Enzyme assays were performed at 50 °C with prewarmed buffer solutions (unless stated otherwise). The NAD+-dependent MDH activity and MDH-stimulating activity of ACT were measured as described earlier (12Arfman N. Watling E.M. Clement W. van Oosterwijk R.J. de Vries G.E. Harder W. Attwood M.M. Dijkhuizen L. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 152: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Arfman N. Van Beeumen J. de Vries G.E. Harder W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3955-3960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 50 °C, and NAD(H) oxidation or reduction was followed at 340 nm in a Hitachi model 100-60 spectrophotometer. The MDH assay, buffered by 100 mm glycine-KOH buffer (pH 9.5), contained 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm NAD+, and enzyme. The reaction was started with 500 mm methanol after a 5-min preincubation. The stimulatory effect of activator protein was analyzed by the subsequent addition of purified activator protein. One unit of MDH-stimulating activity is defined as the amount of ACT that stimulates a fixed quantity of purified MDH (1.0 μg (2.5 pmol) MDH/ml reaction mixture) to 50% of fully ACT-activated MDH (V max) minus the ACT-independent activity of MDH (V o) (16Arfman N. Van Beeumen J. de Vries G.E. Harder W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3955-3960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nudix hydrolase activity of ACT protein was determined in 300 μl of 100 mm glycine-KOH buffer (pH 9.5), containing 10 mm MgSO4 and 250 nmol (di-)nucleotide at 50 °C. Dinucleotide hydrolyzing activity was assayed using an excess amount of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), to hydrolyze the nucleoside monophosphates formed to nucleosides and orthophosphate. Alternatively, in assays with mononucleotides as substrate, yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase (EC3.6.1.1, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to hydrolyze pyrophosphate to orthophosphate. After a 5-min preincubation, reactions were started with 2.5 μg (59 pmol) of purified activator protein. After 10 min the reactions were terminated with 350 μl of 1n H2SO4. Orthophosphate was determined by a slight modification of the method of Ames and Dubin (22Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); 350 ml of a 2× concentrated ascorbate-molybdate mixture was added. After a 20-min incubation at 45 °C, the absorbance of the solution was read in a Hitachi model 100–60 spectrophotometer at 820 nm. 8-oxo-dGTP, which is not commercially available, was prepared as described (23Mo J.Y. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11021-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Enzyme kinetics was studied using standard assay conditions and varying substrate conditions. Data were fitted with Sigma Plot for Windows, Version 5.0 (Jandell Scientific Software) according to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Data obtained in the MDH-activator protein titration experiments was fitted according to the Hill equation. ACT protein was purified from an 8-liter batch culture ofE. coli JM109 (pHK105) (Table I). Cells were grown to an A 595 of 0.5, 1 mmisopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and heterologous gene expression was allowed for a further 2 h, yielding a final A 595 of 1.35. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (25 min, 6,500 × g).Table IPurification of ACT protein from E. coli JM109 (pHK105)Purification stepTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldPurification factormgunits.mg−1%Crude extract5344251001.0Heat treatment1401232762.9Q-Sepharose671746514.1Superdex-200531638383.9Mono-Q362301375.4One unit of MDH-stimulating activity is defined as the amount of ACT that stimulates a fixed quantity of purified MDH (1.0 μg; 2.5 pmol) in the reaction mixture (1 ml) to 50% of V max− V o under reaction conditions described (16Arfman N.

Van Beeumen J. de Vries G.E. Harder W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3955-3960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude extract (9.8 ml containing 534 mg of protein) was prepared as described above. Crude extract was incubated for 30 min at 60 °C. Denatured proteins were precipitated by centrifugation for 10 min at 25,000 × g. The pellet was washed thoroughly with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) to recover any ACT protein present in the pellet. The preparation obtained (6.9 ml) contained 140 mg of protein. The sample was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted by applying a 40-ml linear 0–1 m KCl gradient at a flow rate of 1 ml.min−1. ACT peak fractions were pooled yielding a preparation (12 ml) containing 67 mg of protein. 3-ml samples were applied onto a Superdex-200 column equilibrated with buffer A at a flow rate of 2 ml.min−1. ACT peak fractions of four separate runs were combined yielding a preparation (12 ml) with 53 mg of protein. 2-ml samples were applied onto a Mono-Q column equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted by applying a 20-ml linear 0–1 m KCl gradient at a flow rate of 0.5 ml.min−1. Pooled fractions with ACT activity of six separate runs were combined and frozen at −80 °C. The final preparation (13 ml) contained 36 mg of protein. MDH was purified from B. methanolicus andE. coli as described (12Arfman N. Watling E.M. Clement W. van Oosterwijk R.J. de Vries G.E. Harder W. Attwood M.M. Dijkhuizen L. Arch. Microbiol. 1989; 152: 280-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Overnight cultures were harvested by centrifugation, and cells were disrupted by two passages through a French Pressure cell at 140 megapascals. Crude extracts were prepared by centrifugation for 30 min at 40,000 × g. Proteins were partially precipitated by 30% saturation with ammonium sulfate and incubation for 10 min. Following centrifugation (10 min at 25,000 × g) the supernatant was applied on a Phenyl-Superose (hydrophobic interaction) column equilibrated with 20% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5). Proteins were eluted with a gradient of 20–0% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4. Active fractions were pooled, desalted on PD-10 columns, and applied on a Mono-Q (anion exchange) column. Proteins were eluted with a 1–0 m KCl gradient in buffer A. To separate ACT, MDH containing the bound NAD(H) cofactor, and coenzyme NAD(H), reaction mixtures were loaded on a Phenyl-Superose hydrophobic interaction column equilibrated with 20% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4 in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5). Free nucleotides (NAD+ and NADH) appeared in the flow-through, whereas proteins were eluted with a gradient of 20–0% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4. ACT eluted at 11% (NH4)2SO4 and MDH at 5% (NH4)2SO4. A standard MDH reaction was performed in a total volume of 10 ml. The reaction mixture contained 100 mm glycine-KOH buffer (pH 9.5), 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 500 mm methanol, 1 mmNAD+, 1.0 nmol (400 μg) of pure MDH (10 nmol subunits), and in the activated MDH reaction, 2.5 nmol (105 μg) of pure ACT. The reaction was started by the addition of MDH protein and terminated in a few seconds by rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen. MDH protein was separated from free nucleotides with a Phenyl-Superose hydrophobic interaction column and desalted on a Pharmacia PD-10 column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 6m urea (buffer B). The desalted protein fraction was boiled for 2 min and applied onto a Mono-Q anion exchange column equilibrated with buffer B and eluted in a gradient of 0–1 m KCl in buffer B. A solution of AMP and NADH (10 nmol each) prepared in buffer B and boiled for 2 min served as references on the Mono-Q column. The metal composition of purified MDH was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry using a PerkinElmer 1100B atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Prior to analysis, the enzyme was dialyzed extensively against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The elements magnesium and zinc were analyzed in duplicate. Use of the A1/A2 primers based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of ACT yielded a PCR fragment of the expected size (89 bp), which was cloned into pBlueScriptIIKS (pHK1) and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence was in full compliance with the previously determined N terminus of the ACT protein (16Arfman N. Van Beeumen J. de Vries G.E. Harder W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3955-3960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the correct DNA fragment had been amplified. Southern hybridization experiments with different digests of chromosomal DNA ofB. methanolicus strain C1, using the cloned PCR fragment as probe, revealed in all cases only one clear hybridizing signal (results not shown). A 4.4-kb PstI DNA fragment that hybridized well with the probe was selected to be cloned. For that purpose a partial gene library sequence of B. methanolicus chromosomal DNA was constructed in pBlueScriptIIKS (insert frequency, 60%). Using the primers A1 and A2, a total of 10,000 E. coli MC1061 transformants were screened, yielding 16 PCR-positive transformants. Plasmid DNA analysis of the positive transformants showed that all contained a 4.4-kb PstI insert (pHK83). In total, 1480 bp of the 4.4-kb PstI fragment in plasmid pHK83 was sequenced in both directions, revealing the presence of two open reading frames. Theact ORF (from ATG381 to TGA935, 558 bp in size) encodes a putative protein of 185 amino acids with Mr 21,048. A potential ribosome binding site (AGGA) was identified immediately upstream ofact. The act ORF is immediately followed by ORF2 (at least 545 bp). Screening of the available data bases revealed a strong similarity between ACT and the YQKG gene product of Bacillus subtilis (P54570, 62% identity and 83% similarity with the full-length protein), encoding an ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase (24Dunn C.A. O'Handley S.F. Frick D.N. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32318-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The highly conserved sequence motif characteristic for the E. coli MutT-related proteins or Nudix hydrolase family was detected in the deduced ACT amino acid sequence (Fig.2). Extracts of E. coli MC1061 containing pHK83 failed to stimulate MDH activity. Clear act gene expression in E. coli was observed following its introduction in the expression vector pProk1, yielding pHK105. After induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, extracts of E. coliJM109 (pHK105) displayed high ACT protein activities (425 units.mg−1 protein of MDH-stimulating activity). ACT activity in its native host, B. methanolicus, was estimated as 8.6 units.mg−1 (16Arfman N. Van Beeumen J. de Vries G.E. Harder W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3955-3960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of a Mr 21,000 protein in strain JM109 (pHK105) that was absent in strain JM109 carrying pProk1. ACT protein was estimated to constitute about 40% of the total soluble protein fraction. Following induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, cell extracts were prepared from 8-liter cultures of E. coli JM109 (pHK105).B. methanolicus is a thermotolerant bacterium, able to grow at temperatures up to 60 °C (9Arfman N. Dijkhuizen L. Kirchhof G. Ludwig W. Schleifer K.H. Bulygina E.S. Chumakov K.M. Govorukhina N.I. Trotsenko Y.A. White D. Sharp R.J. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1992; 42: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Dijkhuizen L. Arfman N. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 87: 215-220Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and we observed that ACT protein in E. coli extracts is stable at this temperature for at least 2 h. E. coli proteins started to denature after ∼10 min at 60 °C. After 30 min of incubation, denatured proteins were collected by centrifugation and discarded. A combination of anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration steps allowed purification of active ACT protein. The Mrof native ACT protein was estimated as 45,000 by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex-200 column. ACT thus is a homodimer of 21-kDa subunits. SDS-PAGE showed that this procedure yielded pure ACT protein, with a final purification factor of 5.4 and a total yield of 37% (Table I). ACT appears to be a thermostable enzyme; at 100 °C the half-life of its MDH stimulating activity is 1.5 min. The ACT protein concentration required for maximal stimulation of in vitroactivity of MDH purified from B. methanolicus (bMDH) was determined (Fig. 3). The addition of 1.0 μg.ml−1 (24 pmol.ml−1) ACT protein stimulated initial MDH activity rates (1.0 μg.ml−1 (2.5 pmol.ml−1) MDH protein) by ∼10-fold. The presence of Mg2+-ions was a prerequisite for this stimulating effect (Fig. 3). In view of the presence of the highly conserved Nudix hydrolase sequence motif in ACT, its (di-)nucleotide hydrolyzing activity was evaluated. Experiments were performed in a glycine-KOH buffer (pH 9.5) at 50 °C, the pH and temperature values optimal for MDH activity and for the stimulatory effect of ACT on MDH (16Arfman N. Van Beeumen J. de Vries G.E. Harder W. Dijkhuizen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3955-3960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No activity was detected with the canonical (deoxy-)nucleoside triphosphates, 8-oxo-dGTP, or with diadenosine tri- or tetraphosphates, previously shown to be substrates for members of the Nudix hydrolase family (18Bessman M.J.

However, incubations of ACT with ADP-ribose (ADPR) revealed that this is an outstanding substrate for the enzyme (V max, 348 μmol.min−1.mg−1;K m, 63 μm). ACT also showed a clear NAD+ hydrolyzing activity, although the substrate affinity and V max for NAD+ are much lower, resulting in a catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of 3–4 orders of magnitude lower than for ADPR (0.48 × 103 versus 2.05 × 106m−1.s−1) (Fig.4, TableII). The presence of Mg2+-ions is a prerequisite for ACT catalyzed ADPR and NAD+ hydrolysis. ACT did not show any NADP(H) hydrolyzing activity. Only a very low NADH hydrolyzing activity was detected, at least a factor 100 lower than the NAD+ hydrolysis rate. AMP plus ribose 5′-phosphate and AMP plus NMN+, were identified as the ACT hydrolysis products of ADPR and NAD+, respect"

https://openalex.org/W2055499766,"The functional human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) is a hetero-oligomer composed of two subunits, designated H1 and H2, which are highly homologous. Despite their extensive homology, the major H1 subunit is stably expressed by itself, whereas in the absence of H1 most of the H2 subunits are degraded in the ER. In this study, we were able to investigate the capability of the minor ASGP-R subunit, H2, to function independently of H1, because it was apparently stabilized by fusing its NH2 terminus with an epitope tag. We could thus create stable cell lines in hepatoma-derived SK-Hep-1 cells that expressed the H2 subunit alone. H2 was expressed on the cell surface and was internalized, predominantly through the clathrin-coated pit pathway. Since the internal pool of H2 was also able to traffick to the cell surface, we conclude that H2 recycles between the surface and intracellular compartments, similar to the constitutive recycling of hetero-oligomeric ASGP-R complexes. However, the rate of H2 recycling and internalization was ∼25–33% that of H1. Similar to H1, the H2 polypeptides were also able to self-associate to form homo-oligomers, including trimers and tetramers. However, unlike H1, which can bind the ligand asialo-orosomucoid (ASOR) when overexpressed in COS-7 cells, H2 failed to bind or endocytose ASOR. In summary, the H2 subunit of the human ASGP-R contains functional, although weak, signal(s) for endocytosis and recycling and has the ability to oligomerize. H2 homo-oligomers, however, do not create binding sites for desialylated glycoproteins, such as ASOR, that contain tri- and tetra-antennaryN-linked oligosaccharides. Nonetheless, these results raise the intriguing possibility that naturally occurring H2 homo-oligomers may exist in human hepatocytes and have an as yet undiscovered function.

Chem. 1987; 262: 11825-11832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the human ASGP-R complex, the major H1 subunit, which is the predominant polypeptide, is expressed at a ∼3-fold higher concentration than the minor H2 subunit (10Henis Y.I. Katzir Z. Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1409-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The mature and fully glycosylated forms of the H1 and H2 subunits are ∼46 and ∼50 kDa, respectively (9Bischoff J. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11825-11832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Baenziger J.U. Maynard Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4607-4613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The H1 and H2 polypeptides are highly homologous to each other (12Bischoff J. Libresco S. Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. J.

The ASGP-R is a type II membrane receptor; thus both subunits contain a short cytosolic NH2 terminus, a single transmembrane domain, a stalk segment, and a Ca2+-dependent CRD (17Spiess M. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1986; 44: 177-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Hsueh E.C. Holland E.C. Carrera G.M.J. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4940-4947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In stably transfected murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts, H1 is expressed alone as a 40-kDa precursor containing high mannose oligosaccharides, which is then processed to a 46-kDa mature form found in native ASGP-Rs (19Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When expressed alone in fibroblasts the kinetics of H1 biosynthesis and transport to the cell surface are similar to that of the native H1 subunit endogenously produced in the presence of the H2 subunit in HepG2 hepatoma cells (19Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mature H1 subunit on the plasma membrane is internalized through clathrin-coated pits (20Geffen I. Wessels H.P. Roth J. Shia M.A. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The Tyr5residue in the cytoplasmic tail of H1 plays a significant role in its endocytosis (21Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, internalized H1 is also capable of recycling to the plasma membrane in transfected fibroblasts, and the efficiencies of the internalization and recycling processes are similar to those of endogenously expressed ASGP-Rs (21Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Spiess M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although wild-type H1·H2-containing receptor complexes bind ASOR with high affinity, the H1 subunit is unable to bind ASOR when expressed at low levels in stably transfected fibroblasts (20Geffen I. Wessels H.P. Roth J. Shia M.A. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2855-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast, when overexpressed in COS-7 cells, H1 forms homo-oligomers that generate ASOR binding sites, although with a K d four-times higher than that of native ASGP-Rs, indicating a lower affinity of ASOR binding by H1 homo-oligomers (22Bider M.D. Cescato R. Jeno P. Speiss M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Unlike H1, H2 is usually unstable when expressed by itself. In the absence of H1, newly translated H2 is glycosylated to a 43-kDa precursor form but then rapidly degraded in ∼45–60 min (19Shia M.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1158-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Co-expression of the H1 subunit prevents H2 from being degraded in the ER (23Amara J.F. Lederkremer G. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3315-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), indicating that oligomerization of the H2 subunit with H1 is necessary for H2 stability. Due to its unstable nature when expressed alone, studies of the H2 subunit thus far have been limited to transfected non-hepatic cell lines expressing subphysiological levels of H2 polypeptides that escaped ER degradation. One such report, which described the different sorting information carried by the two human ASGP-R subunits when expressed alone (24Fuhrer C. Geffen I. Huggel K. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3277-3282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), found that the rate of H2 internalization was about 25% that of H1 in transfected fibroblasts. However, in these experiments almost 90% of the expressed H2 polypeptide was degraded in the ER. Here we expressed and analyzed the behavior of H2, in the absence of H1, in a cell line of hepatic origin, to provide an environment similar to that in which the H2 protein is normally expressed. We were able to create stably transfected hepatoma-derived SK-Hep-1 cells expressing the H2 subunit, which had apparently been stabilized by fusing its NH2 terminus with an epitope tag. Here we report that H2, independently of the H1 subunit, can internalize and recycle to the cell surface and form homo-oligomers, but these H2 homo-oligomers do not bind and mediate the internalization of ASOR. ASOR was prepared by desialylation of human orosomucoid (Sigma) with neuraminidase as described previously (25Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 259: 1150-1154Google Scholar). Na125I (10–20 mCi/μg iodine) was from AmershamBiosciences. 1,2,4,6-Tetrachloro-3α,6α-diphenylglycouril (IODO-GEN), BSA protein standard, and protein assay reagents were from Pierce. 125I-ASOR and 125I-IgG was prepared by the IODO-GEN method as described previously (25Oka J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 259: 1150-1154Google Scholar). ASOR conjugated to Alexa Fluor® 488 (fl-ASOR) was prepared using the Alexa Fluor® 488 Protein Labeling Kit from Molecular Probes according to the manufacturer's instruction. All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. pcDNA4/HisMax vector (Invitrogen) was utilized to create pH2/HisMax, a plasmid with a NH2-terminal fusion of the Xpress epitope and His6 tag to the cDNA encoding H2b. ABamHI-EcoRI H2 cDNA fragment, excised from the parental plasmid H2/pcDNA3.1 (26Yik J.H.N. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23076-23083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was inserted into corresponding sites in pcDNA4/HisMax version C plasmid to create pH2/HisMax. The pH2/HisMax plasmid was used to create H2 stable cell lines in SK-Hep-1 cells as well as for transient expression of H2/HisMax fusion protein in COS-7 cells. TheBamHI-EcoRI H2 cDNA fragment was also cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) (Invitrogen) and used to transfect SK-Hep-1 cells, previously transfected with the H1/pIRESneo plasmid, to generate stable cell lines expressing both H1 and H2 (26Yik J.H.N. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23076-23083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The pcDNA4/TO/myc-His plasmid (Invitrogen) was used to create an H2 COOH-terminal fusion with the myc epitope and His6 tag (pH2/myc-His) by inserting theBamHI-PstI H2 fragment into the corresponding sites in pcDNA4/TO/myc-His version C plasmid. The H2 cDNA fragments were purified using the Wizard PCR prep kit (Promega) prior to ligation. To generate stable transfectants expressing H1, the H1 cDNA fragment was subcloned into pIRES/neo (CLONTECH) as follows. H1 cDNA, inserted atHindIII-EcoRI sites in the parental plasmid H1/pcDNA3.1 (27Zeng F.-Y. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32454-32460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), was digested with HindIII and blunt-ended using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Promega) and dideoxynucleotides (Amersham Biosciences). EcoRI linkers (New England Biolabs) were ligated to the blunt ends and subsequently digested with EcoRI. The EcoRI fragment containing H1 cDNA was gel-purified and ligated into theEcoRI site of pIRES/neo (from CLONTECH). The recombinant H1/pIRESneo plasmids in the ligation mix were transformed into Escherichia coli (Top10 strain from Invitrogen) for screening and amplification. The correct orientation of inserted H1 cDNA in recombinant plasmids was checked by restriction digestion. The final H1/pIRESneo plasmid was sequenced to verify the complete open reading frame and then used to create stably transfected SK-Hep-1 cell lines. SK-Hep-1 and COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in complete medium: DMEM (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology), 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfection of COS-7 cells for transient expression or of SK-Hep-1 cells for stable expression was performed using a Calcium Phosphate Transfection Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two μg of plasmid DNA was used to transfect 60–70% confluent cells in each 35-mm dish. The resultant stably transfected SK-Hep-1 cell lines were selected 3 days post-transfection in complete medium containing either 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) or 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Cell lines expressing both H1 and H2 were selected in medium containing 200 μg/ml each of G418 and Zeocin antibiotics. The clonal cell lines were maintained in the same medium used for their selection. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA in PBS) for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed, and the samples were prepared by boiling for 5 min in 1× Laemmli buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) containing 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran, 0.1-μm pore size from Schleicher and Schuell) by the method of Burnette (29Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites were first blocked by incubating for 30 min in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 6.7 mm KCl containing 1.5% (w/v) BSA (Buffer 1/BSA). The membranes were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the same Buffer 1/BSA containing 1 μg/ml of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-H1 or anti-H2 IgG (26Yik J.H.N. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23076-23083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20 and incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated to goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) in Buffer 1/BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Proteins were visualized using the alkaline phosphatase substrates p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate p-toluidine salt (Bio-Rad) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 0.5 mmMgCl2 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transiently transfected COS-7 cells (36–48 h post-transfection) or stably transfected SK-Hep-1 cells were grown in 12-well culture dishes in complete medium. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 0.5 ml Buffer 1/BSA per well containing 1 μg/ml 125I-ASOR or affinity-purified anti-H2 125I-IgG. For competition binding experiments, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ASOR or anti-H2 IgG was added to the binding medium. The binding medium was aspirated, and cells were washed three times with cold PBS. Cells were solubilized in 1 n NaOH, radioactivity was determined using a Packard COBRATM II γ counter, and protein concentration in the cell lysate was estimated by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using BSA as standard. Internalization rates were determined as In/Sur ratios as described by Wiley and Cunningham (31Wiley H.S. Cunningham D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4222-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following binding and removal of excess unbound radioiodinated antibody or ASOR as described above, internalization was induced by the addition of 1 ml prewarmed DMEM to each well and placing culture dishes in a 37 °C water bath. After the desired internalization periods, the medium was aspirated, and cells were washed three times with cold PBS on ice. The rest of the procedure was performed on ice. PBS was aspirated and 1 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, was added to cells for 5 min. Phosphate buffer was removed by aspiration, and uninternalized ASOR or IgG was removed from the cell surface by incubation with 0.5 ml of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, for 15 min. This glycine wash was removed, saved, and the cells were solubilized in 1.0 ml of 1 n NaOH. The radioactivity in the glycine wash and solubilized cells were measured, and the ratio of internalized (cell-associated) to surface counts (glycine wash) was calculated and plotted versus time. The slope of this line indicates the receptor internalization rate. To monitor the effect of hyperosmolarity on receptor internalization, cells were pretreated with DMEM containing 0.4 m sucrose for 15 min, and the binding and internalization steps were performed as described above in the continuous presence of 0.4 m sucrose. SK-Hep-1 cells expressing H1 or H2/HisMax subunits were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes and washed with PBS. Prewarmed DMEM containing 1 mg/ml proteinase-K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the cells, which were then incubated at 37 °C for various times. Detached cells were collected, pelleted at 4 °C, and washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were then solubilized in lysis buffer containing 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the lysates were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE. The H1 and H2 subunits were detected by Western analysis with the subunit-specific polyclonal antibodies as described above. Images of the Western blots were captured digitally, and the density of the H1 and H2 protein bands was quantified using a FluorchemTM 8000 Imaging System (Alpha Innotech Corp.) The percentages of H1 and H2 remaining at each time point, compared with the amount recovered at time 0, were plotted. COS-7 cells in 60-mm dishes were co-transfected with 4 μg each of pH2/HisMax and H2/myc-His plasmid DNA and were lysed 48 h post-transfection as described above. All steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise noted. The volume of cell lysate was adjusted to 450 μl with lysis buffer, and an equal volume of Buffer 1/BSA was then added. The lysate was precleared with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (1:1 slurry) that was previously treated with Buffer 1/BSA for 1 h. The lysate was then centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of mouse IgG or monoclonal antibody against either the myc(H2/myc-His) or the Xpress (H2/HisMax) epitopes (Invitrogen). After overnight immunoadsorption on a rotating platform, 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose (1:1 slurry) was added, and the samples were incubated for an additional 1 h. The antigen-antibody-protein G-Sepharose complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with PBS. The immuno-adsorbed proteins were dissociated from protein G-Sepharose by boiling for 5 min in 1× Laemmli buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by detection of H2 fusion protein in parallel Western blots using anti-Xpress or anti-myc monoclonal antibodies as described above. COS-7 cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected with pH2/HisMax, washed, and scraped 48 h post-transfection into 200 μl of cold PBS. Scraped cells (50 μl) were incubated in microcentrifuge tubes on ice with 2 mm disuccinimidyl suberate (Peirce), freshly prepared as a 100 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide. The cross-linking reaction was carried out for various times on ice and then quenched by the addition of Tris, pH 7.5, to 10 mm. Cells were pelleted and then solubilized in lysis buffer as described above. Samples were boiled in Laemmli buffer (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) for 5 min and subjected to non-reducing SDS-PAGE using a 10% (w/v) gel. H2 was detected as described above using affinity-purified anti-H2 IgG, and the M r values of reactive bands were estimated using a FluorchemTM 8000 imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Stably transfected SK-Hep-1 cells were grown in Lab-Tek® II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) to ∼50–75% confluence and washed in PBS. The cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min on ice and then washed in PBS. The rest of the protocol was performed on ice. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with Buffer 1/BSA. Clathrin was detected using a monoclonal antibody against clathrin heavy chain (Transduction Laboratories) diluted 1:500 in Buffer 1/BSA and Oregon-Green conjugated to goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), while H2 was detected with polyclonal rabbit anti-H2 IgG (1 μg/ml) and Cy3-labeled sheep anti-rabbit IgG. Buffer 1/BSA was also used for appropriate secondary antibody dilutions as suggested by the supplier. Cell samples were incubated with secondary antibody conjugates for 15 min, washed in PBS, mounted in FluorSave (Calbiochem), and fluorescence was detected using a Leica TCS NT laser confocal microscope. Digital images were recorded using Leica TCS software. In the experiments to detect internalized ASOR, cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml fl-ASOR for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM. Following a PBS wash, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, mounted, and examined as described above. The H2 polypeptide is unstable when expressed alone using the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. However, we were able to study the characteristics of the H2 subunit in the absence of the H1 subunit, because masking its NH2 terminus with an epitope tag apparently stabilized the expression of H2. We generated an H2 fusion protein, designated H2/HisMax (molecular mass ∼52 kDa), by the addition of both the His6 tag and Xpress epitopes to the NH2terminus of the H2 protein using the pcDNA4/HisMax expression vector. The native H2 polypeptides derived from pcDNA3.1 and the H2/HisMax fusion proteins derived from pcDNA4/HisMax were expressed in COS-7 cells and the H2 proteins were detected by immunoblotting. The expressed H2/HisMax fusion protein was stable (Fig.1, lane 2), whereas the H2 protein expressed from the pcDNA3.1 vector was present as a partially degraded ∼35-kDa species (Fig. 1, lane 3,arrow). Since this 35-kDa band is not present in transiently transfected cells expressing H2/HisMax, it is unlikely to be a precursor of the mature H2 protein. In addition, a 35-kDa H2 precursor protein during the biosynthesis of H2 has not been described. In the HepG2 hepatoma cell line, H2 is synthesized as a 43-kDa high mannose-containing precursor, which is then processed to a 50-kDa mature form (9Bischoff J. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11825-11832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 35-kDa protein is likely a ER degradation product of H2, which has been reported before by others (23Amara J.F.

Although the precise mechanism for the H2 stabilization we observed is unknown, the fusion of the H2 NH2 terminus with Xpress epitope and His6 tag apparently rescued the H2 protein from degradation in the ER. The H2/HisMax fusion cDNA was then transfected into SK-Hep-1 cells, to create cell lines that stably expressed H2 at levels similar to native hepatoma cell lines. We determined the expression of H2/HisMax at the plasma membrane in these cell lines by quantifying anti-H2 125I-IgG binding at 4 °C (Fig.2). The anti-H2 125I-IgG specifically bound to H2 in SK-Hep-1 cells expressing this protein, since excess unlabeled anti-H2 IgG markedly reduced the radioactivity associated with those cells and IgG binding to cells transfected with the plasmid alone was minimal (Fig. 2, “Vector”). We conclude that the H2 subunit contains the necessary information required for its translocation to the plasma membrane in the absence of the H1 subunit. Since H2 was present on the cell surface in transfected SK-Hep-1 cells, we tested its ability to be internalized by following the uptake of anti-H2 125I-IgG that had been allowed to bind on ice to cell surface H2/HisMax. Cells with 125I-IgG bound to the cell surface were then warmed to 37 °C to induce internalization, and the apparent internalization rate was determined from the ratio of IgG internalized to IgG remaining on the cell surface (i.e.the In/Sur ratio). The increase in the In/Sur ratio with increasing time showed that the H2/HisMax proteins were internalized in SK-Hep-1 cells (Fig. 3 A). Initially, H2/HisMax was internalized more rapidly, with almost 20 and 31% of surface-bound IgG localized internally after 2 and 5 min, respectively (In/Sur ratios of 0.28 and 0.45). However, after the first 5 min, it took another ∼30 min for half of the initial surface-bound anti-H2 IgG to be internalized (In/Sur ratio of 1.04), indicating a reduction in H2/HisMax internalization rate. Thus, after a period of initial rapid uptake, the H2 internalization rate decreased by ∼80%. Nonetheless, the internalization of H2/HisMax was continuous, and almost 70% of the 125I-IgG bound to H2/HisMax on the cell surface was internalized after 3 h (Fig. 3 B). We compared the rates of H1 and H2/HisMax internalization in stably transfected SK-Hep-1 cells expressing either H1 or H2/HisMax. H1 or H2/HisMax on the cell surface was allowed to bind subunit-specific, affinity-purified 125I-IgG. The rates of anti-H1 and anti-H2 IgG uptake were then assessed in parallel. The H1 subunits were internalized faster than H2/HisMax subunits (Fig.4 A). Thus, after 5 min ∼50% of the H1 was internalized (In/Sur ratio of 1.1) compared with ∼33% for H2/HisMax (In/Sur ratio of 0.5). The difference in their internalization rates was even more apparent at longer time; after 12 min ∼67% of H1 was internalized compared with ∼40% of H2/HisMax. A difference in H1 and H2/HisMax internalization rates was also seen in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 4 B). In COS-7 cells, however, H1 internalization was slower than in SK-Hep-1 cells, whereas the H2/HisMax internalization rate was not significantly different in these two cell lines. Since the hetero-oligomeric human ASGP-R is internalized via the clathrin-coated pit pathway (34Beltzer J.P. Spiess M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3735-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), we determined whether H2 alone is also internalized via coated pits. The internalization rate of surface-bound anti-H2125I-IgG was determined in H2/HisMax stable transfectants after their ability to form clathrin-coated pits was impaired by hyperosmolar treatment (35Oka J.A. Christensen M.D. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12016-12024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Heuser J. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, sucrose treatment reduced anti-H2125I-IgG uptake. However, inhibition was not complete, since ∼28% of surface H2 was still internalized after 30 min in sucrose-treated cells, compared with ∼51% internalization in untreated cells. In contrast, similar treatment more substantially reduced ASOR uptake by ASGP-Rs in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5,inset). Almost 80% of the surface-bound ASOR was internalized in untreated HepG2 cells in 30 min, compared with ∼20% in sucrose-treated cells. Thus, sucrose treatment led to a 75% reduction in ASOR internalization by ASGP-Rs in HepG2 cells, compared with a ∼45% decrease observed for H2/HisMax in SK-Hep-1 cells. Uptake of H2 via clathrin-coated pits was corroborated by the co-localization of H2/HisMa"

Binding of T4 gp43 to its mRNA target (translational operator RNA) interferes with gp43-DNA interactions, but it is unclear how the protein determinants for binding DNA are affected by the dynamics of gp43-mRNA interactions. We have used RB69 gp43, a natural variant of the T4 enzyme whose crystal structure has been determined to identify protein sites that respond to the interaction with specific RNA. We used protein phosphorylation markers, photocross-linking studies, protease sensitivity assays, and mutational analyses to examine the effects of operator RNA on the enzyme's five structural domains (N, exo, palm, fingers, and thumb). Our studies suggest that this RNA affects gp43-DNA interactions through global effects on protein structure that occlude DNA-binding sites but leave the enzyme accessible to interactions with the sliding clamp (RB69 gp45) and possibly other polymerase accessory proteins.

We discuss the possible biological significance of putative RNA-binding motifs in the N and palm domains of RB69 gp43. polymerase 3′-exonuclease cAMP-dependent protein kinase photocross-linked The replicative DNA polymerase of bacteriophage T4, product of phage gene 43 (gp43), is a pol α-like (B-family) enzyme that displays a number of activities, all resident in the same 898-residue protein molecule (reviewed in Ref. 1Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 65-96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its two distinct catalytic functions (i.e. the polymerase (pol)1 and 3′-exonuclease (exo or editing) activities, T4 gp43 bears specific binding activities to deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs)), other proteins of the T4 DNA replication complex, and its own mRNA. In vivo, T4 gp43 functions as an autogenous translational repressor that interacts with a nucleotide sequence, termed “translational operator,” which overlaps the ribosome-binding site in the translation-initiation region of gene 43-encoded mRNA (2Andrake M.

Biol. 1990; 213: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It is known that the RNA determinants of operator specificity to the protein include a propensity of the nucleotide sequence to form a specific stem-loop (hairpin) structure (2Andrake M. Guild N.

Nucleotide sequence-independent interactions with the protein are also required (6Pavlov A.R. Karam J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4657-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the protein determinants required for recognition of the RNA determinants of specificity. In the work described here, we identified some of the protein sites for translational operator recognition through studies that utilized a phylogenetic variant of T4 gp43, the enzyme from phage RB69 (7Wang C.C. Yeh L.S. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26558-26564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Wang J. Sattar A.K. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of RB69 gp43 has been determined (8Wang J. Sattar A.K. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and subsequently refined through structural studies of gp43-DNA cocrystals (9Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 10Shamoo Y. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). RB69 gp43 consists of five modules, or domains (N, exo, fingers, palm, and thumb), the orientations of which differ slightly between the two DNA-binding configurations of the enzyme (i.e. the pol or “closed” form (9Franklin M.C. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 657-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and the exo or “open” form (10Shamoo Y. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar)). The apoenzyme crystallizes in the “open” configuration (8Wang J. Sattar A.K. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). There is no similar structural information available for the complex between RB69 gp43 and its operator RNA. We have used the known structural features of RB69 gp43 as a framework for a multifaceted analysis of complexes between this protein and its mRNA target. In one type of analysis, we introduced protein phosphorylation markers at specific RB69 gp43 sites and measured the ability of operator RNA to alter the level of phosphorylation at these sites. We observed a mix of responses to the RNA, including inhibition and stimulation of phosphorylation, depending on site location. In some cases (e.g. the gp43 site for interaction with the sliding clamp protein (RB69 gp45)), operator RNA had no effect on phosphorylation. Collectively, the results suggest that operator RNA induces specific global changes in the structure of RB69 gp43 that interfere with access to the DNA binding grooves of the protein but not with sites of gp43 interaction with certain polymerase accessory proteins. Results of other studies that utilized protein-RNA photocross-linking, protease sensitivity assays, and site-directed mutagenesis also showed that operator RNA binding affects multiple sites on the same face of RB69 gp43 that binds DNA. Overall, our studies provide a rationale for proposing that specific RNA evolved as a physiological regulator of the access of DNA to sites on this DNA polymerase. We note and discuss the presence in RB69 gp43 of amino acid sequences that resemble RNP motifs of known RNA-binding proteins. The Escherichia coli strain DH5α (F−φ80dlacZΔM15Δ(lacZYA-argF) U169deoR recA1hsdR17(r−k,m−k)phoA supE44 λ-thi-1gyrA96 relA1) was used as host for transformations with recombinant DNA in all protocols involving the cloning of DNA fragments in expression vectors and the introduction of specific mutations in cloned DNA through site-directed mutagenesis. DH5α was purchased as a frozen stock from Invitrogen (catalog no. 18265-17) and used as recommended by this supplier. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was used as the bacterial host for recombinant plasmids in experiments requiring in vivotranscription of cloned RB69 or T4 genetic sequences under control of a plasmid-borne T7 φ10 promoter. BL21(DE3) carries a chromosomally integrated T7 RNA polymerase gene that can be activated throughlac operon inducers (11Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar). The inducer used here was isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. E. colistrain CAJ70 was used as host for RB69 phage infections as previously described (7Wang C.C. Yeh L.S. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26558-26564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Wang C.C. Pavlov A. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17703-17710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Many of the plasmids we used were constructed as part of this study and are described below and under “Results.” Other plasmids used have been described in previous reports (7Wang C.C. Yeh L.S. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26558-26564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Wang C.C. Pavlov A. Karam J.D. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10387-10397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The purified T4 gp43 and RB69 gp43 used for photocross-linking and, in the case of RB69 gp43, protease sensitivity assays were prepared by ion exchange and DNA-cellulose chromatography, as described previously (12Wang C.C. Pavlov A. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17703-17710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 14Andrake M.D. Karam J.D. Genetics. 1991; 128: 203-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For RB69 gp43 phosphorylation assays, we used N-terminally or C-terminally histidine-tagged derivatives of this protein. Optimal conditions for protein purification with such derivatives were obtained with three histidines added to the C-terminal end or six histidines added to the N-terminal end of the protein. The histidines were introduced through PCR-driven site-directed mutagenesis of pCW19R, a recombinant plasmid that carries the wild-type RB69 gene 43 under control of the T7 φ10 promoter (12Wang C.C. Pavlov A. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17703-17710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 13Bebenek A. Dressman H.K. Carver G.T., Ng, S. Petrov V. Yang G. Konigsberg W.H. Karam J.D. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10387-10397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Stratagene’s QuikChange protocol and reagents were used for the in vitro mutagenesis. We fused three histidine codons to the 3′-terminal end of the open reading frame of the gene by amplifying pCW19R in the presence of a synthetic DNA duplex in which the sense strand had the sequence 5′-gttcgatatgttcgattttCACCACCACtgaTATAATGTCGACCTGC-3′ (RB69 gp43 codons in lowercase, histidine codons in uppercase, and vector residues italicized). This resulted in the isolation of pVPR43C-His3 (Table I). To add six histidine codons to the 5′-terminal side of the RB69 gene 43 open reading frame, we constructed pVPR43N-His6 (Table I) by amplifying pCW19R in the presence of a synthetic DNA duplex in which the sense strand had the sequence 5′-GTCtaaaggaaattaaatgCACCACCACCACCACCACaaagaattttacttaacgg-3′ (RB69 gene 43 sequence in lowercase, initiation codon underlined, histidine codons in uppercase, and vector residues italicized). The two resulting plasmid constructs, pVPR43C-His3 and pVPR43N-His, were isolated, and their nucleotide sequences were verified after transforming products of the respective QuikChange mutagenesis protocol into E. coli DH5α.Table IConstruction of PKA targets in RB69 gp43 Open table in a new tab His-tagged RB69 gp43 was purified from crude extracts of the appropriate clones following induction of transcription of recombinant plasmids in vivo. In each case, about 10 ml of E. coli BL21(DE3) culture (OD ∼0.5) containing the recombinant plasmid of interest was aerated with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (at 1 mm) for 2 h at 30 °C to effect elevated synthesis of gp43 under control of the plasmid-borne T7 promoter. Induced cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min and washed in 5 ml of sonication buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 400 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole before being resuspended in 0.5 ml of the same buffer. The concentrated cell suspension was then sonicated (model W-225R sonicator; Heat Systems-Ultrasonics) and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 30 min. The resulting 0.4–0.5 ml of crude extract was applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid spin column (Qiagen; catalog no. 30210). After washing the column with 20 volumes of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 20 mm imidazole and 400 mm NaCl, bound material was eluted with buffer containing 100 mm imidazol. The eluate was dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol and then stored at −20 °C until used. Typical yields using this protocol were 100–150 μg of purified gp43. The sequence R(R/K)X(S/T) in proteins can be phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit (α isoform, PKA) of mouse cAMP-dependent protein kinase. RB69 gp43 contains no such sequence but does contain several short sequences that differ from the site for PKA by one or two amino acids. We used site-directed mutagenesis to generate a set of clones from VPR43C-His3 and pVPR43N-His6, whose protein products could be phosphorylated at designated sites by PKA. These clones and their encoded proteins (each bearing a histidine tag and a target for PKA) were each compared with the wild-type construct (pCW19R and its encoded gp43) for biological and in vitro properties by using previously described methods (12Wang C.C. Pavlov A. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17703-17710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The constructs used here (see “Results”) were all similar to the wild-type construct in replication proficiency and RNA-binding properties (results not shown). TableI lists the specific nucleotide and amino acid substitutions used to generate the phosphorylation markers in RB69 gp43 for this study. For the conduct of gp43 phosphorylation assays (see “Results”; Fig.2), 2.5 pmol of the desired gp43 construct (purified on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column) were incubated at 37 °C with or without operator RNA (at 50 nm when used) and 1 unit of a commercial PKA that does not require cAMP for activation (catalog no. 6000S; New England Biolabs). The reaction mixture (25 μl) also contained 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μCi of γ-32P-labeled ATP, 20 μm cold ATP, 500 nmE. coli tRNA (catalog no. 109550; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 8 units of the RNase inhibitor RNasin (catalog no. 4769401; Promega). Samples (5 μl) were removed from each reaction mixture at 1-min intervals and diluted into 10 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8) buffer containing 2.3% (w/v) SDS and 50 mm mercaptoethanol. The samples were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Nucleotide sequences of the RNA substrates used for photocross-linking experiments are depicted in Fig. 1. The RNAs were synthesized by in vitro transcription of the appropriate DNA duplexes that had been cloned into the BglII-SmaI interval of the T7/SP6 expression vectors pSP73 and pSP72, sold by Promega (Madison, WI) (catalog no. P2191 and P2221, respectively). Nucleotide sequences of the sense strands of the cloned DNAs were as follows: (i) 5′-GATCTATAATATATCAAGAGCCTAATAACTCGGGCTATAAACTAAGGAATATCTATGAAAGAATT-3′, for cloning the T4 “CWTop” operator sequence (Fig. 1) under control of the SP6 promoter of pSP73, and (ii) 5′-GATCTAAAACAAAAGACAATAACTCGTCTAAAGGAAATTAAATGAAAGAAUUUCCC-3′, for cloning of the RB69 “RBop4” operator sequence (Fig.1) under control of the T7 φ10 promoter of pSP72. For in vitro transcription reactions, recombinant plasmids containing the desired DNA sequences were linearized byBamHI digestion, repurified, and then used in the RiboMax® transcription mixture sold by Promega (catalog no. P1300) with either T7 RNA polymerase or SP6 RNA polymerase. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 5 μg of DNA template, the four ribonucleoside triphosphates (ATP, CTP, UTP, and GTP) at 300 μm each, and 90 units of the designated RNA polymerase. The mixtures were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C and then quenched by the addition of 5 units of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (catalog no. P1300; Promega). After an additional incubation of 15 min at 37 °C, RNA products were purified through two phenol/chloroform (pH 4.5) extractions and one ethanol precipitation, dissolved in 100 μl of nuclease-free 10 mmTris-Cl (pH 8.0) buffer, and separated from small DNA and RNA fragments and nucleotides on “Quick Spin G-50” columns (catalog no. 100406; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Purity of the RNA products was evaluated by electrophoretic analysis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 7m urea, and RNA concentrations were determined spectophotometrically. For radiolabeling RNA, [α-33P]UTP (catalog no. NEG-307H; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to transcription mixtures at 50 μCi/reaction (specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol). To prepare photoreactive RNA products for cross-linking experiments, the unlabeled CTP in these mixtures was replaced with 5-iodo-CTP (catalog no. I5628; Sigma). All manipulations with photoreactive RNAs were performed under reduced light conditions or in the dark. The iododerivatives of operator RNAs exhibited a diminished affinity to gp43 (by ∼10-fold) as compared with the unmodified counterparts; however, binding remained specific (i.e. 7–10-fold higher affinity than with RNA of nonspecific nucleotide sequence (results not shown). Radiolabeled RNA substrates were examined for purity by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea and visualized by the use of a phosphor imager (Fuji model FLA-3000). RNA stocks were stored at −80 °C and used within 3–4 days of preparation for radiolabeled RNAs or 4–5 weeks of preparation for unlabeled RNAs. The methods we used to identify RNA-linked gp43 peptides (Figs. 3 and 4) were based on the demonstrated utility of methylene blue as an enhancer of photocross-linking between proteins that bind specific RNA and base-paired residues in the RNA (15Liu Z.R. Wilkie A.M. Clemens M.J. Smith C.W. RNA. 1996; 2: 611-621PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the utility of iodosubstituted pyrimidines as chromophores (16Meisenheimer K.M. Koch T.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 101-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we used 5 ng of methylene blue (catalog no. M9140; Sigma) per pmol of RNA. The reaction mixtures for cross-linking (25 μl) were deposited in the wells of a microtiter plate that was placed on an ice surface and subsequently exposed to a source of high intensity visible light (20-watt, 1200-lumen lamp, EarthLight®; Philips) for 20–40 min. Samples of the irradiated solutions were subsequently made 7m in urea, incubated at 42 °C for 15 min, and then analyzed by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 7m urea. Resolved radioactive gel bands were visualized and quantitated by using the phosphor imager.Figure 4A, amino acid sequence of cross-linked 29-kDa peptide. Nine N-terminal residues of the 29-kDa peptide produced in the experiment for Fig. 3B, lane 4, were sequenced (see “Experimental Procedures”). The rest of the sequence was inferred from the approximate size of the peptide and cleavage site specificity of clostripain. Boldface residues are identical to corresponding positions in T4 gp43 (7Wang C.C. Yeh L.S. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26558-26564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Shaded segments were implicated in the cross-link with RNA (see “Results”). Italicized residues correspond to a segment of the fingers domain that can be deleted (DelM mutants; Fig. 3) without loss of the RNA-binding function. Underlined residues were substituted with alanine and tested for biological activity in plasmid-phage complementation assays as described previously (Ref. 12Wang C.C. Pavlov A. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17703-17710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar; see Table IIand Fig. 5). B, RNA-mediated protection of RB69 gp43 from cleavage with clostripain. The upper part shows electrophoretic separation (SDS-PAGE) of products from incubations of RB69 gp43 with clostripain in the presence (+) and absence (−) of RBop4 RNA (see “Experimental Procedures”). Interpretations of the results are diagrammed in the lower part, with the photocross-linked 29-kDa gp43 fragment marked in themiddle of the bar representing the length of the RB69 gp43 molecule. The cleavage at position Arg249 was determined by N-terminal sequencing of the ∼50-kDa fragment. The cleavage at Arg707/Arg719 was inferred from the sizes of peptide products separated by SDS-PAGE after partial hydrolysis with clostripain and the specificity (Arg-X) of this protease.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Irradiated mixtures of RB69 gp43 (100 pmol) and 33P-labeled iodocytosine-containing RBop4 RNA (20 pmol), were treated with RNases A and T1 (1 μl of 2 units/reaction each) for 30 min at 37 °C to effect complete hydrolysis of the RNA. The RNase-treated material was then incubated with 0.5 μg (in 2 μl) of preactivated clostripain (Sigma; catalog no. C0888) for 1 h at the same temperature. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of electrophoresis loading buffer containing 2% SDS and 100 mm dithiothreitol, followed by a 15-min incubation at 60 °C. Electrophoretic analysis of the hydrolysis products of photocross-linked material was carried out by SDS-PAGE (12.5% gels), and resolved bands were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (“Trans-Blot”; Bio-Rad catalog no. 162-0180) using a semidry electroblot system (Novablot®, model 2117-250; AmershamBiosciences). The membranes were then stained for 30 min in 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (made in 50% methanol) and partially destained in 50% methanol. A radiolabeled gp43 fragment (∼29 kDa) was localized on the stained membrane, excised, and completely destained in methanol. Subsequently, N-terminal sequence determination was carried out on this peptide through the core facility at Louisiana State University (New Orleans, LA), which uses an Applied Biosystems model 447 pulsed liquid protein sequencer. In experiments that assessed the effect of operator RNA on hydrolysis of RB69 gp43 by clostripain (protein protection by unmodified RNA; see Fig. 4B), 2.5 μg of the protein were incubated for specified time periods at 25 °C with 0.25 μg of preactivated clostripain in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg of RBop4 RNA in 25 μl of solution containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1 mm CaCl2, and 20 μg/ml E. coli tRNA. Proteolysis was arrested by the addition of 25 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 0.1 mmercaptoethanol. Then this solution was heated in a boiling water bath for 2 min, and aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gel) in duplicate sets. One set was stained for protein with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the other set was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for subsequent N-terminal sequencing of the separated peptides, as described above for samples that were subjected to both RNase and protease treatments following photocross-linking. Previous studies seemed to suggest that operator RNA makes multiple contacts with gp43, some at locations outside the protein regions that bind primer-template DNA (4Pavlov A.R. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12968-12972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wang C.C. Pavlov A. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17703-17710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We introduced phosphorylation markers at various positions in RB69 gp43 and scanned the protein molecule for those sites whose access to the protein kinase PKA could be affected by the interaction with operator RNA. Results are shown in Fig.2. We observed two types of effects by operator RNA on phosphorylation within this set of RB69 gp43 markers: inhibition (site 382RRRS385; Fig. 2) and stimulation (sites 25RRRT28,240RRLS243, and245RRKT248; Fig. 2). Inhibition of phosphorylation at the 382RRRS385 site may reflect either a direct or indirect occlusion of the site by the RNA. We note that this site is within ∼25 Å of the primer-template junction in the crystal structure of RB69 gp43 (8Wang J. Sattar A.K. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A.

Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The RNA-mediated stimulatory responses at the other three gp43 sites are likely to be the result of RNA-induced conformational changes in the protein. For some of the PKA targets that we introduced into RB69 gp43, we observed no effect by the RNA on phosphorylation of the respective gp43 construct. One of the unaffected sites,893RRAS895 (Fig. 2), is located in the C-terminal tail segment of this 903-residue polymerase (i.e.in a gp43 segment known to bind the phage-induced polymerase processivity factor gp45 (sliding clamp protein) (10Shamoo Y. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1999; 99: 155-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar)). As also shown in Fig. 2B, and perhaps as expected, phosphorylation of the893RRAS895 site is inhibited by purified RB69 gp45. The addition of operator RNA did not alter the inhibitory effect by RB69 gp45, suggesting that gp43-operator interactions do not overlap, or affect, the gp43 determinants for binding the sliding clamp. Interestingly, the three sites whose phosphorylation is stimulated by operator RNA (Fig. 2) are clustered in the vicinity of a gp43 region that has been proposed to interact with the phage-induced single strand-binding protein, gp32 (8Wang J. Sattar A.K. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 1087-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar); however, it is not yet known if operator RNA can affect gp32-gp43 interactions. Recently, we demonstrated that iodocytosine-substituted RNA targets corresponding to the T4 and RB69 operator hairpins can be photocross-linked to the respective gp43 at high efficiency (up to 50%) in the presence of the dye methylene blue. 2Petrov, V., and Karam, J. (2002) Nucleic Acids Res.30, 3341–3348. Such cross-linking between proteins and RNA or DNA is known to be specific to base-paired regions of the nucleic acid (15Liu Z.R. Wilkie A.M. Clemens M.J. Smith C.W. RNA. 1996; 2: 611-621PubMed Google Scholar). We also showed that the base-paired C at position −14 of RBop4 RNA (Fig. 1) can be photocross-linked to T4 gp43 as well as to RB69 gp43.2 In Fig.3A, we compare the levels of gp43-RNA photocross-linked (XL) products obtained in experiments that utilized the two types of operator RNA substrates diagrammed in Fig. 1as ligands for wild-type RB69 gp43 and T4 gp43. Conditions for photocross-linking were optimized for maximal yields of XL products, as described elsewhere,2 in order to attempt to isolate these products for further analysis. We also examined photocross-linking of the same RNA targets with an in-frame deletion mutant of T4 gp43 (T4 DelM; Fig. 3A) that we had previously observed to possess the specific RNA binding activity of the wild-type protein (7Wang C.C. Yeh L.S. Karam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26558-26564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although we have been able to visualize products of photocross-linking between gp43 and operator RNA substrates from both the T4 and RB69 phage systems, we have only been able to subsequently analyze products containing RB69-derived components. For unknown reasons, cross-linked products between RB69 gp43 and RBop4 could be solubilized in buffer lacking denaturants (SDS or urea), whereas similar products containing T4 gp43 were not similarly soluble. Fig. 3B shows electrophoretic separations of the XL products we used in the analyses described below. In one type of analysis, photocross-linked material from the mixture of RB69 gp43 and RBop4 RNA (XL in Fig. 3B, lane 2) was incubated with a mixture of RNases T1 and A to effect complete hydrolysis of the RNA in the complex. Electrophoretic analysis of the hydrolysate (not shown), yielded an estimate of 1 mol of33P-labeled nucleotide/mol of cross-linked product. This estimate is consistent with our previous findings,2 which also showed that the point of cross-linking is the iodocytosine-[33P]U dinucleo"
