https://openalex.org/W2126084304,"The human X chromosome has a unique biology that was shaped by its evolution as the sex chromosome shared by males and females. We have determined 99.3% of the euchromatic sequence of the X chromosome. Our analysis illustrates the autosomal origin of the mammalian sex chromosomes, the stepwise process that led to the progressive loss of recombination between X and Y, and the extent of subsequent degradation of the Y chromosome. LINE1 repeat elements cover one-third of the X chromosome, with a distribution that is consistent with their proposed role as way stations in the process of X-chromosome inactivation. We found 1,098 genes in the sequence, of which 99 encode proteins expressed in testis and in various tumour types. A disproportionately high number of mendelian diseases are documented for the X chromosome. Of this number, 168 have been explained by mutations in 113 X-linked genes, which in many cases were characterized with the aid of the DNA sequence."

https://openalex.org/W2026489116,"Multiferroic materials, which reveal magnetic and electric order, are in the focus of recent solid state research. Especially the simultaneous occurrence of ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, combined with an intimate coupling of magnetization and polarization via magneto-capacitive effects, could pave the way for a new generation of electronic devices. Here we present measurements on a simple cubic spinel with unusual properties: It shows ferromagnetic order and simultaneously relaxor ferroelectricity, i.e. a ferroelectric cluster state, reached by a smeared-out phase transition, both with sizable ordering temperatures and moments. Close to the ferromagnetic ordering temperature the magneto-capacitive coupling, characterized by a variation of the dielectric constant in an external magnetic field, reaches colossal values of nearly 500%. We attribute the relaxor properties to geometric frustration, which is well known for magnetic moments, but here is found to impede long-range order of the structural degrees of freedom."

https://openalex.org/W2052219130,"Although parasite-host co-speciation is a long-held hypothesis, convincing evidence for long-term co-speciation remains elusive, largely because of small numbers of hosts and parasites studied and uncertainty over rates of evolutionary change. Co-speciation is especially rare in RNA viruses, in which cross-species transfer is the dominant mode of evolution. Simian foamy viruses (SFVs) are ubiquitous, non-pathogenic retroviruses that infect all primates. Here we test the co-speciation hypothesis in SFVs and their primate hosts by comparing the phylogenies of SFV polymerase and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit II from African and Asian monkeys and apes. The phylogenetic trees were remarkably congruent in both branching order and divergence times, strongly supporting co-speciation. Molecular clock calibrations revealed an extremely low rate of SFV evolution, 1.7 x 10(-8) substitutions per site per year, making it the slowest-evolving RNA virus documented so far. These results indicate that SFVs might have co-speciated with Old World primates for at least 30 million years, making them the oldest known vertebrate RNA viruses."

https://openalex.org/W2038675399,"The conventional way to measure electrical current is to record voltage drop across a resistor; Ohm's law does the rest. This treats the current as a continuous flow of charge, rather than a series of single electrons. A new device measures electrical flow in a fundamentally different way, counting electrons one by one. It makes use of a phenomenon known as time-correlated quantum mechanical tunnelling oscillation, analogous to the better known a.c. Josephson effect. Individual electrons flow into an ultrasensitive charge sensor at a well determined time separation. Electron counting makes it possible to measure extremely small currents more accurately than with established techniques. The fact that electrical current is carried by individual charges has been known for over 100 years, yet this discreteness has not been directly observed so far. Almost all current measurements involve measuring the voltage drop across a resistor, using Ohm's law, in which the discrete nature of charge does not come into play. However, by sending a direct current through a microelectronic circuit with a chain of islands connected by small tunnel junctions, the individual electrons can be observed one by one. The quantum mechanical tunnelling of single charges in this one-dimensional array is time correlated1,2,3, and consequently the detected signal has the average frequency f = I/e, where I is the current and e is the electron charge. Here we report a direct observation of these time-correlated single-electron tunnelling oscillations, and show electron counting in the range 5 fA–1 pA. This represents a fundamentally new way to measure extremely small currents, without offset or drift. Moreover, our current measurement, which is based on electron counting, is self-calibrated, as the measured frequency is related to the current only by a natural constant."

https://openalex.org/W2131485957,"Although originally characterized as nuclear enzymes controlling the stability of nucleosomes, histone deacetylases (HDACs) may also exert their activity within the cytosol. Recently, we have demonstrated that HDAC8, a class I HDAC, is a novel, prominently cytosolic marker of smooth muscle differentiation. As HDAC8 displays a striking stress fiber-like pattern of distribution and is coexpressed in vivo with smooth muscle alpha-actin (alpha-SMA) and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, we have explored the possible participation of this HDAC in smooth muscle cytoskeleton regulation. Cell fractionation assays performed with primary human smooth muscle cells (HSMCs) showed that HDAC8, in contrast to HDAC1 and HDAC3, was enriched in cytoskeleton-bound protein fractions and insoluble cell pellets, suggesting an association of HDAC8 with the cystoskeleton. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using HSMCs, NIH-3T3 cells, and human prostate tissue lysates further demonstrated that HDAC8 associates with alpha-SMA but not with beta-actin. HDAC8 silencing through RNA interference strongly reduced the capacity of HSMCs to contract collagen lattices. Mock transfections had no effect on HSMC contractily, and transfections with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) specific for HDAC6, a cytosolic HDAC that functions as an alpha-tubulin deacetylase, resulted in a weak contraction inhibition. Although mock- and HDAC6 siRNA-transfected HSMCs showed no noticeable morphological changes, HDAC8 siRNA-transfected HSMCs displayed a size reduction with diminished cell spreading after replating. Altogether, our findings indicate that HDAC8 associates with the smooth muscle actin cytoskeleton and may regulate the contractile capacity of smooth muscle cells."

https://openalex.org/W2036888550,"Following the massive loss of life caused by the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake in Indonesia and its tsunami, the possibility of a triggered earthquake on the contiguous Sunda trench subduction zone is a real concern. We have calculated the distributions of co-seismic stress on this zone, as well as on the neighbouring, vertical strike-slip Sumatra fault, and find an increase in stress on both structures that significantly boosts the already considerable earthquake hazard posed by them. In particular, the increased potential for a large subduction-zone event in this region, with the concomitant risk of another tsunami, makes the need for a tsunami warning system in the Indian Ocean all the more urgent."
https://openalex.org/W1965309337,"Although the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARα) binds and is activated by a variety of synthetic xenobiotics, the identity of the high affinity endogenous ligand(s) is incompletely resolved. Likewise, it is not known how putative endogenous ligands alter PPARα conformation in order to affect transcriptional regulation. Direct fluorescence binding and fluorescence displacement assays showed for the first time that PPARα exhibits high affinity (1–14 nm Kd values) for unsaturated long chain fatty acyl-CoAs as well as unsaturated long chain fatty acids commonly found in mammalian cells. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer between PPARα aromatic amino acids and bound corresponding naturally occurring fluorescent ligands (i.e. cis-parinaroyl-CoA, trans-parinaric acid) yielded intermolecular distances of 25–29 Å, confirming close molecular interaction. Interestingly, although PPARα also exhibited high affinity for saturated long chain fatty acyl-CoAs, regardless of chain length (1–13 nm Kd values), saturated long chain fatty acids were not significantly bound. In contrast to the similar affinities of PPARα for fatty acyl-CoAs and unsaturated fatty acids, CoA thioesters of peroxisome proliferator drugs were bound with 5–6-fold higher affinities than their free acid forms. Circular dichroism demonstrated that high affinity ligands (long chain fatty acyl-CoAs, unsaturated fatty acids), but not weak affinity ligands (saturated fatty acids), elicited conformational changes in PPARα structure, a hallmark of ligand-activated nuclear receptors. Finally, these ligand specificities and induced conformational changes correlated functionally with co-activator binding. In summary, since nuclear concentrations of these ligands are in the nanomolar range, long chain fatty acyl-CoAs and unsaturated fatty acids may both represent endogenous PPARα ligands.

Fayard E. Picard F. Auwerx J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Abnormal PPAR activation contributes to lipotoxicity associated with obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia (1Francis G.A. Fayard E. Picard F. Auwerx J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 2Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). PPARs have been identified in several species, with at least three isotypes recognized (α, β/δ, and γ; NR1C1, NR1C2, and NR1C3, respectively). These isotypes are differentially expressed in select tissues, with expression levels depending on cellular processes (reviewed in Ref. 3Hihi A.K. Michalik L. Wahli W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 645-650Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The primary amino acid sequence of PPARs is similarly organized as that of other nuclear receptors, with an N-terminal A/B domain containing a ligand-independent transactivation function, the DNA-binding domain (C), a hinge region (D), the ligand-binding domain (LBD) containing a ligand-dependent transactivation function (E), and a C-terminal F domain (4Blanquart C. Barbier O. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Glineur C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because of their multiple roles in regulating fatty acid metabolism and cell differentiation as well as disease (diabetes, obesity, cancer), much attention has focused on the specificities of the PPAR family for xenobiotics/therapeutic agents that bind and regulate the transcriptional activity of PPARα (5Gottlicher M. Widmark E. Li Q. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4653-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 6Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3011) Google Scholar). Although once believed to be orphan receptors, PPARs are now recognized to be ligand-activated members of the steroid/thyroid nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. Each isotype is encoded by a different gene and exhibits unique binding specificities for a broad variety of xenobiotics (reviewed in Refs. 1Francis G.A. Fayard E. Picard F. Auwerx J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar and 3Hihi A.K. Michalik L. Wahli W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 645-650Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar). PPARα is now recognized to promiscuously bind with high affinity xenobiotic substances such as hypolipidemic agents, plasticizers, herbicides, and dietary factors (reviewed in Refs. 7Green S. Wahli W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 100: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Lemberger T. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Plenum Press, New York1999: 199-209Google Scholar). The acceptance of such a large variety of structurally diverse, xenobiotic ligands is believed to be due to the large pocket comprising the binding site of the LBD (11Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Plunket K.D. Moore L.B. Collins J.L. Oplinger J.A. Kliewer S.A. Gampe R.T. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Willson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13919-13924Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Although the above studies demonstrate high affinity binding of multiple xenobiotics, investigations attempting to identify the endogenous high affinity ligand(s) of PPARα are less clear. First, although long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) are thought to be putative endogenous PPARα ligands, most radioligand binding studies suggest that PPARα exhibits only weak affinities for LCFAs. Such radioligand binding assays demonstrate that PPARα binds unsaturated LCFAs (arachidonic, petroselenic, linolenic, linoleic, and oleic acids) with only weak affinities (Kd values in the micromolar range) and saturated LCFAs (lauric and palmitic acids) are bound even less well (9Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 94: 4312-4317Crossref Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 12Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 13Kliewer S.A. Sundseth S.S. Jones S.A. Brown P.J. Wisely G.B. Koble C.S. Devchand P. Wahli W. Willson T.M. Lenhard J.M. Lehmann J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4318-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar, 14Isseman I. Prince R.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 11: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These radioligand-based affinities for LCFAs are several orders of magnitude weaker than PPARα exhibits for synthetic xenobiotics. Further, recent confocal fluorescence imaging of nonmetabolizable fluorescent LCFAs in living cells shows that nucleoplasmic LCFA concentrations are in the range of 39–68 nm (15Huang H. Starodub O. McIntosh A. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29139-29151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 16Huang H. Starodub O. McIntosh A. Atshaves B.P. Woldegiorgis G. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2484-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, based on radioligand binding assays, it would appear unlikely that long chain fatty acids are physiologically significant endogenous ligands for PPARα. However, it is known that such radioligand binding assays underestimate the affinities of other fatty acid binding proteins (liver fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP); sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2)) by several orders of magnitude (reviewed in Refs. 17McArthur M.J.

Acta. 1995; 1259: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, more recent data with a direct fluorescent ligand binding assay determined that mouse PPARα binds a naturally occurring fluorescent LCFA, trans-parinaric acid, with high affinity as shown by a Kd of 30 nm (20Lin Q. Ruuska S.E. Shaw N.S. Dong D. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 21Ellinghaus P. Wolfrum C. Assmann G. Spener F. Seedorf U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2766-2772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, displacement of this fluorescent ligand by nonfluorescent LCFAs yielded nanomolar Ki values for a variety of naturally occurring, nonfluorescent unsaturated LCFAs (arachidonic, linolenic, linoleic, and oleic acids) but not saturated LCFAs (stearic and palmitic acids) (20Lin Q. Ruuska S.E. Shaw N.S. Dong D. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Whether these high affinities reflect a unique property of the fluorescent ligand, trans-parinaric acid, or whether radioligand binding assays underestimate PPARα affinities remains to be determined. Resolving these issues is important, because the concentration of LCFAs in the nucleoplasm is in the nanomolar rather than micromolar range (15Huang H. Starodub O. McIntosh A. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29139-29151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Second, it is unclear whether only unsaturated but not saturated LCFAs represent physiologically significant endogenous PPARα ligands. In transactivation assays wherein cultured cells are supplemented with exogenous LCFAs, both saturated (palmitic) and unsaturated (arachidonic, linoleic, linolenic, and oleic) fatty acids enhance PPARα transactivation nearly equally well (5Gottlicher M. Widmark E. Li Q. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4653-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 9Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In dietary studies wherein rats are fed high fat diets, PPARα-activated gene expression is increased, regardless of whether the dietary lipid composition is mostly polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, or saturated LCFA (25Bonilla S. Redonnet A. Noel-Suberville C. Pallet V. Garcin H. Higueret P. Br. J. Nutr. 2000; 83: 665-671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If LCFAs are the exclusive endogenous ligand for PPARα, it is difficult to reconcile these PPARα transactivation and activation data with the ligand binding data indicating that PPARα binds well only to the unsaturated, but not saturated, LCFAs (9Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 94: 4312-4317Crossref Scopus (1844) Google Scholar, 12Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Taken together, these studies would suggest that, especially in the case of saturated LCFAs, a metabolite rather than the saturated LCFA itself might be the active endogenous PPARα ligand (24Banner C.D. Gottlicher M. Widmark E. Sjovall J. Rafter J.J. Gustafsson J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1583-1591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, increasing data indicate that a LCFA metabolite such as LCFA-CoA may represent active endogenous high affinity PPARα ligand(s). Early radioligand competition studies show that both unsaturated and saturated LCFA-CoAs are weak PPARα ligands. Displacement of a bound radiolabeled substrate by LCFA-CoAs (palmitoyl-CoA, oleoyl-CoA, and linoleoyl-CoA) yields micromolar Ki values comparable with those obtained with the corresponding LCFAs in the same radioligand binding assay (i.e. Ki < 5 μm) (26Murakami K. Ide T. Nakazawa T. Okazaki T. Mochizuki T. Kadowaki T. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Since nucleoplasmic levels of LCFA-CoAs are very low, in the 3 nm range (16Huang H. Starodub O. McIntosh A. Atshaves B.P. Woldegiorgis G. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2484-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), based on radioligand binding data it would appear unlikely that LCFA-CoAs represent physiologically important endogenous ligands for PPARα. In contrast, other data suggest that LCFA-CoAs compete with LCFAs for binding to PPARα and antagonize PPARα transcriptional activation (26Murakami K. Ide T. Nakazawa T. Okazaki T. Mochizuki T. Kadowaki T. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Elholm M. Dam I. Jorgenesen C. Krogsdam A.-M. Holst D. Kratchamarova I. Gottlicher M. Gustafsson J.A.

Unfortunately, the physiological significance of the latter findings is unclear, since the radioligand-binding assay used yielded very weak PPARα affinities for LCFA-CoAs (i.e. micromolar Kd values). However, it is known that radioligand binding assays underestimate the affinities of other LCFA-CoA-binding proteins (L-FABP, SCP-2, and acyl-CoA-binding protein) for LCFA-CoAs by several orders of magnitude (reviewed in Refs. 18Frolov A.

Thus, the possibility that the radioligand binding assay significantly underestimates the affinity of PPARα for LCFA-CoAs must be considered. Fourth, although it is accepted that ligand-induced conformational changes are associated with the transcriptional activation of ligand-activated nuclear receptors (reviewed in Refs. 1Francis G.A.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4625-4633Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), how putative endogenous PPARα ligands (i.e. LCFA or LCFA-CoA) alter the structure of PPARα to affect co-factor recruitment is unknown. Whereas NMR and x-ray crystallography of PPARα demonstrate substantial conformational changes upon binding of xenobiotics (i.e. the dihydrocinnamate derivative AZ242, l-tyrosine analogues) (35Cronet P.

Nature. 2002; 415: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), there are no direct studies demonstrating that LCFA binding alters PPARα conformation. However, other PPAR isoforms demonstrate such ligand-induced alterations in structure as evidenced by x-ray crystallography of PPARγ and PPARβ, where LCFA (i.e. eicosapentaenoic acid) or xenobiotic (e.g. glitazones) binding alters the structure/conformation of these isoforms (reviewed in Ref. 32Escher P. Wahli W. Mutat. Res. 2000; 448: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Finally, recent experiments demonstrate that binding of a nonhydrolyzable LCFA-CoA analogue changes PPARα sensitivity to protease digestion and alters its ability to bind to co-activators, suggesting a conformational change (27Elholm M. Dam I. Jorgenesen C. Krogsdam A.-M. Holst D. Kratchamarova I. Gottlicher M. Gustafsson J.A. Berge R.K. Flatmark T. Knudsen J. Mandrup S. Kristiansen K. J. Biol.

Unfortunately, these experiments looked at pure recombinant proteins in the presence of high levels of free ligands, so the effect of ligands on native proteins in the presence of other factors is still unknown. Such ligand-induced conformational changes are a hallmark of ligand-activated nuclear receptors (reviewed in Refs. 1Francis G.A. Fayard E. Picard F. Auwerx J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar and 31Xu J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, if LCFAs and/or LCFA-CoAs represent functional ligands for PPARα, it is essential to demonstrate that these endogenous ligands physically alter the structure/conformation of the PPARα isoform. The objective of the present study was to begin to resolve these issues through use of (i) direct ligand binding assays that do not suffer from the limitations of radioligand binding assays (i.e. fluorescent ligand binding assays, nonfluorescent ligand binding assays based on quenching of tyrosine emission, and displacement of bound fluorescent ligand), (ii) fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between PPARα aromatic amino acids and bound fluorescent ligand (trans-parinaric acid and cis-parinaroyl-CoA) to calculate the intermolecular distance, (iii) circular dichroism to characterize potential ligand-induced changes in PPARα secondary structure, and (iv) co-immunoprecipitation to determine whether ligands that bind and alter PPARα secondary structure also influence the ability of PPARα to interact with co-activators. Chemicals—cis-Parinaric acid, trans-parinaric acid, NBD-chloride, and NBD-stearic acid were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). cis-Parinaroyl-CoA was synthesized as previously described (33Petrescu A.D. Hertz R. Bar-Tana J. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. J. Biol.

Coenzyme A, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, myristoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, stearoyl-CoA, palmitoleoyl-CoA, oleoyl-CoA, linoleoyl-CoA, arachidonoyl-CoA, and bezafibrate were from Sigma. Medica 16, as well as the coenzyme A thioesters of Medica 16 and bezafibrate, were chemically synthesized as described (38Bar-Tana J. Kahn-Rose G. Srebnik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8404-8410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kawaguchi A. Yohmura T. Okuda S. J. Biochem.

All CoA thioesters, whether freshly synthesized or obtained commercially, were >95% undegraded. Mouse PPARα monoclonal, rabbit PPARα polyclonal, mouse steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) monoclonal, and rabbit SRC-1 polyclonal antibodies were from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). Anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were from Sigma. Mammalian co-immunoprecipitation kit, chemiluminescent substrate, and film were from Pierce. Recombinant Mouse PPARα Protein—In the present investigation, PPARαΔAB (amino acids 101–468) was utilized for all ligand binding and structure determinations. This choice, rather than the much smaller LBD, was based on recent studies demonstrating that deletion of additional parts of a nuclear transcription factor can significantly alter ligand binding affinity and specificity. 2Petrescu, A. D., Hertz, R., Bar-Tana, J., Schroeder, F., and Kier, A. B. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, in press. The cDNA encoding mouse PPARα with a deletion of the amino-terminal A/B domain (i.e. encoding PPARα amino acids 101–468) was cloned into a His6-tagged bacterial expression vector (pET-PPARαΔAB) and was a generous gift from Dr. N. Noy (Cornell University) (20Lin Q. Ruuska S.E. Shaw N.S. Dong D. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was expressed in the BL21(DE3)pLysS strain of Escherichia coli as described (20Lin Q. Ruuska S.E. Shaw N.S. Dong D. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and purified by affinity chromatography with cobalt resin (BD Biosciences Clontech). Purified protein was dialyzed against a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 400 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol and stored at –80 °C in 25% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining detected a single intense band of ∼50 kDa (not shown). Western blotting with rabbit anti-mouse PPARα monoclonal antibody followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was performed as described (41Martin G.G. Huang H. Atshaves B.P. Binas B. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11520-11532Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Western blotting with rabbit anti-mouse PPARα monoclonal antibody also resulted in a single band at 50 kDa (not shown). Both SDS-PAGE/Coomassie Blue protein staining and Western blotting confirmed the presence of the PPARαΔAB protein in monomeric form. Direct Fluorescent Ligand Binding Assays—Direct fluorescent ligand (NBD-stearic acid, NBD-chloride, cis-parinaric acid, trans-parinaric acid, and cis-parinaroyl-CoA) binding measurements were performed as described earlier (29Frolov A.A.

Briefly, increasing quantities of fluorescent ligand (5–2000 nm) were added from a concentrated stock to 0.1 μm PPARαΔAB in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Excitation was carried out at 466 nm for NBD-stearate and at 310 nm for parinaric acid or parinaroyl-CoA. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained at 24 °C with a PC1 photon-counting spectrofluorometer (ISS Inc., Champaign, IL) and corrected for background (protein only and fluorescent ligand only), and maximal intensities were measured. The dissociation constant (Kd) and the number of binding sites (n) were obtained by a reciprocal plot of 1/(1 – F/Fmax) and CL/F/Fmax according to Equation 1 as previously de"

In this study we showed that a key mechanistic event in the remodeling process of photosystem I (PSI) and its associated light-harvesting proteins (LHCI) is the N-terminal processing of Lhca3. N-terminal processing of Lhca3 is documented independently by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis as well as by quantitative comparative MS/MS peptide profiling using isotopic labeling of proteins. Dynamic remodeling of the LHCI complex under iron deficiency is further exemplified by depletion of Lhca5 and up-regulation of Lhca4 and Lhca9 polypeptides in respect to photosystem I. Most importantly, the induction of N-terminal processing of Lhca3 by progression of iron deficiency correlates with the functional drop in excitation energy transfer efficiency between LHCI and PSI as assessed by low temperature fluorescence emission spectroscopy. Using an RNA interference (RNAi) strategy, we showed that the truncated form of Lhca3 is essential for the structural stability of LHCI. Depletion of Lhca3 by RNAi strongly impacted the efficiency of excitation energy transfer between PSI and LHCI, as is the case for iron deficiency. However, in contrast to iron deficiency, comparative MS/MS peptide profiling using isotopic labeling of proteins demonstrated that RNAi depletion of Lhca3 caused strong reduction of almost all Lhca proteins in isolated PSI particles.

The viability of a photosynthetic organism is dependent on its ability to regulate the structure and function of its photosynthetic apparatus in anticipation of or in response to external factors such as light quality and nutrient availability. Iron is a cofactor in many essential biological redox reactions, including respiration and photosynthesis, and its scarcity leads to chlorosis (chlorophyll deficiency) in photosynthetic organisms, which is connected to degradation and rearrangement of the photosynthetic machinery (1Spiller S.

Hippler M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6709-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The global impact of iron deficiency on photosynthetic productivity has been shown in vast ocean regions that are severely limited in iron (5Behrenfeld M.J. Kolber Z.S. Science. 1999; 283: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). On the molecular level, photosystem (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry; RNAi, RNA interference; LHCI, light-harvesting complex; EST, expressed sequence tag. I is a prime target of iron deficiency, probably because of its high iron content (12 iron per PSI). In the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii iron deficiency leads not only to a pronounced degradation of PSI but also to a remodeling of the PSI-associated light-harvesting antenna (LHCI), which proceeds severe iron deficiency (4Moseley J.L. Allinger T. Herzog S. Hoerth P. Wehinger E. Merchant S. Hippler M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6709-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These structural changes decrease the functional efficiency of excitation energy transfer between LHCI and PSI and minimize photo-oxidative stress to the thylakoid membrane. Cyanobacteria also respond to iron deficiency by degradation of light-harvesting phycobilisomes (6Guikema J.A. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. 1983; 74: 90-95Crossref Google Scholar). Additionally, cyanobacteria express the “iron stress-induced” gene isiA. The IsiA protein has significant sequence similarity with CP43, a chlorophyll a-binding protein of photosystem II (PSII (7Laudenbach D.E. Straus N.A. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5018-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 8Burnap R.L. Troyan T. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar)) and forms a ring of 18 molecules around a PSI trimeric reaction center, as shown by electron microscopy (9Boekema E.J.

Barber J. Nature. 2001; 412: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). These results highlight the adaptive nature of the response to iron deficiency that is directed toward optimizing the photosynthetic architecture to the conditions in which iron is a limiting cofactor. In Chlamydomonas, neither the molecular mechanisms underlying the remodeling of LHCI nor its structural and functional characteristics have been investigated. It is of note that the LHCI composition of Chlamydomonas is complex and consists of nine distinct subunits (11Stauber E.J. Fink A. Markert C. Kruse O. Johanningmeier U. Hippler M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 978-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this study we combined low temperature fluorescence spectroscopy, reverse genetics, and comparative quantitative proteomics to correlate the efficiency of excitation energy transfer with dynamic alterations of LHCI. We established an approach that is based on differential isotopic labeling of proteins in Chlamydomonas by isotopically labeled arginine and mass spectrometric quantitative analysis of labeled and unlabeled peptides. Mass spectrometry has become a powerful tool for quantitative proteomics, because it allows sensitive, fast, and specific identification of proteins from complex mixtures (12Ranish J.F. Yi E.C.

Comparative analysis of a protein between experimental and control samples can be used to monitor its relative changes in abundance under these two conditions. Comparing the relative amount of many proteins in parallel in this manner enables a quantitative overview of the dynamically altered proteome, in our case the remodeled photosynthetic apparatus. To distinguish proteins from control and experimental conditions, differential isotopic labeling strategies can be employed. Tagging of protein mixtures is either achieved by cross-linking proteins isolated from cells grown under different conditions with isotopically labeled and unlabeled chemical probes (15Gygi S.P. Rist B. Gerber S.A. Turecek F. Gelb M.H. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (4362) Google Scholar) or metabolic labeling with stable isotopes by growing cells in isotopically enriched media (16Ong S.E. Blagoev B.

Cowburn D. Chait B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6591-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). After tagging the protein or cells, pools are mixed, digested with enzymes, and quantified by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). A key assumption for both processes is that isotopically labeled and native peptides will behave similarly because the quantification is based on intensities or peak areas of both forms of the same peptide as measured in the mass spectrometer. The green unicellular alga C. reinhardtii has emerged as a eukaryotic model system for the investigation of fundamental molecular processes in cell biology (18Harris E.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 363-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), and especially for the study of chloroplast-based oxygenic photosynthesis (19Hippler M. Rimbault B. Takahashi Y. Protist. 2002; 153: 197-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Rochaix J.D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The availability of a draft genome sequence, including over 200,000 ESTs (21Shrager J. Hauser C. Chang C.W. Harris E.H. Davies J. McDermott J. Tamse R. Zhang Z. Grossman A.R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), allows application of genomic and proteomic methodologies (22Stauber E.J. Hippler M. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2004; 42: 989-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Quantitative approaches that are applicable on the proteomic scale, such as the one used in this study, will aid in the characterization of dynamic changes because of different physiological conditions or distinct genetic backgrounds. Strains and Cultures—The cell wall-less strain CC124 [CW15] or the arginine auxotrophic strain CC424 was used for all experiments. For all quantitative experiments using LC-MS/MS, strain CC424 was used. This strain was kindly provided by the Chlamydomonas culture collection (for information see the website www.chlamy.org). Cells were grown in the presence of either normal or isotopically labeled 13C6-l-arginine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA). Arginine concentrations were 50 μg/ml (23Yamaguchi K. Prieto S. Beligni M.V. Haynes P.A. McDonald W.H. Yates III, J.R. Mayfield S.P. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2957-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cell culture and transfer of cells from iron-sufficient to iron-deficient media were carried out essentially as described (4Moseley J.L. Allinger T. Herzog S. Hoerth P. Wehinger E. Merchant S. Hippler M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6709-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—For generation of the inverted repeat Lhca3 construct, a short 216-bp fragment corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of Lhca3 was amplified with PCR by using the EST clone AV387462 (www.kazusa.or.jp/en/plant/chlamy/EST/) (24Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Sato S. Fukuzawa H. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) as template and the primers LH-FORS-P (aaaactgcaggctccagtcagc, underlined PstI) and LH-REV-E (atcgaattcggccgcagccacgac, underlined EcoRI) adding EcoRI and PstI restriction sites. A longer 316-bp fragment additionally contained 100 bp from the adjacent coding sequence that function as spacer in the inverted repeat construct and was amplified by using the primers LH-FORL-P (aaaactgcagtgtgatgaccggcaaag, underlined PstI) and LH-REV-E (atcgaattcggccgcagccacgac, underlined EcoRI). Both fragments were cloned in the antisense direction by using the vector pBluescript SK. The resulting inverted repeat cassette was excised with EcoRI and cloned in the unique EcoRI site of the Maa7/X inverted repeat construct that was kindly provided by H. Cerutti (see Ref. 25Rohr J. Sarkar N. Balenger S. Jeong B.R. Cerutti H. Plant J. 2004; 40: 611-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nuclear Transformation and Selection—Nuclear transformation of Chlamydomonas was carried out by using a helium-driven PDS-1000/He particle gun (Bio-Rad) with 1100 pounds/square inch rupture discs (Bio-Rad). M10 tungsten particles (Bio-Rad) were coated with 2 μg of DNA of the IRMaa7/IRLhca3 construct, washed three times with 500 μl of absolute ethanol, and resuspended in 25 μl of absolute ethanol; 7 μl of the suspension were used for one transformation. Wild-type cells were grown at 25 °C and 50 μE m–2 s–1 in liquid TAP medium, and 4 × 107 cells were dispersed per TAP plate containing 1.5 mm l-tryptophan, 5 μg/ml paromomycin, and 5–10 μm 5-fluoroindole. The transformed cells were incubated at 25 °C and 3 μE m–2 s–1 for 1–2 weeks. The appearing transformants were transferred on fresh TAP plates containing l-tryptophan, paromomycin, and 5-fluoroindole and used for further investigations. Isolation of Intact Chloroplasts—Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4 °C and 3,500 × g) and resuspended to a concentration of ∼7 × 107 cells/ml in buffer with 0.3 m sucrose, 25 mm HEPES, and 0.5 mm MgCl2. Cells were disrupted in a self-made nebulizing chamber by nebulizing the cell suspension against a ceramic ball with N2 gas at a pressure of ∼15 pounds/square inch. Intact chloroplasts were harvested using Percoll cushions of 80, 60, and 40% (v/v). Thylakoid membranes were isolated as described previously (26Chua N.H. Bennoun P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2175-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) from broken chloroplasts. Isolation of PSI—Enrichment of PSI from thylakoids solubilized in n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside using sucrose gradient centrifugation was done as described previously (27Hippler M. Drepper F. Farah J. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6343-6349Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Protein Analysis—Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Differentially labeled samples (12C and 13C) were combined on an equal protein basis. Proteins were separated on 13% gels by SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar, 30Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Immunodetection and LC-MS/MS Analyses of Proteins—Immunodetection was carried out as described previously (31Hippler M. Klein J. Fink A. Allinger T. Hoerth P. Plant J. 2001; 28: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Antibodies directed against PsaD were produced using the following two peptides for immunization of rabbits: peptide 1, EAEAAPAAAKKAAEK; peptide 2, EAKKEQIFEMPTGGAA. Antibody production was managed by Eurogentec (Belgium). The antibodies were used in a 1:1000 dilution. The other antibodies used have been described before (4Moseley J.L. Allinger T. Herzog S. Hoerth P. Wehinger E. Merchant S. Hippler M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6709-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In-gel tryptic digestion was carried out essentially as described previously (31Hippler M. Klein J. Fink A. Allinger T. Hoerth P. Plant J. 2001; 28: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), with acetonitrile as the organic phase. Autosampling and chromatography were done essentially as described previously (11Stauber E.J. Fink A. Markert C. Kruse O. Johanningmeier U. Hippler M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 978-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The following changes were made. Samples were first injected onto a μ-Precolumn (PepMap™ C18, 5 μm, 100 Å, 300 μm inner diameter × 5 mm; LC-Packings, Sunnyvale, CA) and washed for 4 min at a flow rate of 0.25 μl/min with the aqueous phase by a nano-column switching device (Switchos, LC-Packings) that directed the flow to the analytical column. A fused silica needle with 8-μm aperture (FS360-75-8-N-5-C12; New Objective, Woburn, MA) was used for ionization of peptides. Mass spectra were measured with an LCQ Deca XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA). Acquisition of mass spectra and sequence identification using Sequest software (Thermo Electron, San Jose, California) were done as described previously (11Stauber E.J. Fink A. Markert C. Kruse O. Johanningmeier U. Hippler M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 978-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The presence of the 13C6-Arg label was taken into account (+6 Da). For quantitative analysis, doubly charged sister peptides were chosen. Tandem mass spectra were gathered within a m/z range so that both sister peptides would be fragmented concurrently. A wide enough range (7–10 m/z) was chosen so that all isotope peaks were acquired. This was important because we observed a broadening of the isotope profile for the 13C-labeled samples, which was probably because of metabolism of 13C6-Arg and incorporation of 13C into other amino acids. Peak areas for the LC-MS/MS elution profiles of 12C- and 13C-labeled singly or doubly charged y ions were then determined using Qualbrowser software (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA). The abundance ratios were calculated from the peak areas. Ratios were calculated for all identified y ion pairs, and the mean ± S.D. was calculated. Because ratios calculated from the LC-MS/MS data differed from those observed from immunoblot analyses, the peak areas from the LC-MS/MS analyses were normalized to the immunoblot signals for Lhca3, PsaD, and CF1. Fluorescence Emission Analysis—Low temperature fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on whole cells with a Fluorolog-3 (Horiba, Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ) spectrofluorometer. Data were normalized to the emission peak at 685 nm. Identification of a New Lhca Protein by Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and MS/MS—In a recent investigation, immunoblotting in combination with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to detect a new light-harvesting complex protein that is specific for iron-deficient growth conditions (4Moseley J.L. Allinger T. Herzog S. Hoerth P. Wehinger E. Merchant S. Hippler M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6709-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The protein spot containing this novel Lhca protein had been shown to increase in abundance during the adaptation to iron-deficient growth conditions in thylakoid membrane preparations (Fig. 1A). Analysis of a tryptic digest of this spot by MS/MS identified the protein as Lhca3 based on the fragmentation pattern of the two doubly charged ions, m/z 701.8 and 1015.8, that were matched with the Lhca3 peptide sequences WLQYSEVIHAR and GSGDAAYPGGPFFNLFNLGGK, respectively, using Sequest software. The fragmentation pattern of the peptide with a m/z 701.8 is shown in Fig. 1B. The New Lhca3 Protein Is a Result of N-terminal Processing— Immunodetection of a higher molecular weight form of Lhca3 using an antibody specific for its N terminus (anti-14.1 (31Hippler M. Klein J. Fink A. Allinger T. Hoerth P. Plant J. 2001; 28: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)) showed that this form nearly completely disappeared in thylakoids isolated from iron-deficient growth conditions (4Moseley J.L. Allinger T. Herzog S. Hoerth P. Wehinger E. Merchant S. Hippler M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6709-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Because the lower molecular weight form of Lhca3 was no longer detected by the N-terminal specific antibody, it must be the product of a processing event at the N terminus of the protein. The protein spot corresponding to the processed form of Lhca3 has an isoelectric point (pI) of about 5.0 and is slightly more acidic as compared with the mature protein (pI 5.1) (4Moseley J.L. Allinger T. Herzog S. Hoerth P. Wehinger E. Merchant S. Hippler M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6709-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Calculation of its molecular mass from SDS-PAGE analysis, using known masses for Lhca1, Lhca3, Lhca4, Lhca5, and PsaF yielded a value of about 23,800 Da. Molecular masses and pI of processed forms, assuming putative processing events within the N-terminal part, were calculated by using the computation pI/MW tool on the Expasy website (us.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html). This analysis revealed that processing between DR (closest to the N terminus, between positions 9 and 10) and DG (most distant from N terminus, positions 27 and 28) defined the region where processing occurs, because only processing in-between these sites would produce a product having a pI value more acidic as compared with the mature protein and an appropriate molecular mass in respect to the mass estimated for the processed form. By taking the molecular mass, the fact that the first 15 N-terminal amino acids were used for immunization (EEKSIAKVDRSKDQL), and the pI of the processed form into account, we suggested that the novel N terminus starts at amino acid 16 (YVGASQ...) or amino acid 17 (VGASQ...). N-terminal Processing of Lhca3 Correlates with the Impaired Efficiency of Excitation Energy Transfer from LHCI to PSI— Adaptation of Chlamydomonas to iron deficiency leads to a decreased efficiency of excitation energy transfer between LHCI and PSI (4Moseley J.L. Allinger T. Herzog S. Hoerth P. Wehinger E. Merchant S. Hippler M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6709-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). To determine whether the impact on efficiency correlates with induction of the N-terminal processing of Lhca3, we measured low temperature fluorescence emission spectra from Chlamydomonas cells that were grown under iron-sufficient conditions and then shifted to iron-deficient growth conditions for 1–5 days (Fig. 1C). Fluorescence peaks at 685 and 711 nm obtained with whole cells grown under iron-sufficient conditions are characteristic of LHCII attached to PSII and LHCI attached to PSI, respectively (32Wollman F.-A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 680: 352-360Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In the absence of PSI or in case of functional impairment of excitation energy transfer between LHCI and PSI, the LHCI fluorescence emission is shifted toward 700–705 nm (32Wollman F.-A. Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 680: 352-360Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Takahashi Y. Yasui T.A. Stauber E.J. Hippler M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7816-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the low temperature fluorescence emission maximum from iron-replete cells at 711 nm changes to 704 nm after 2 days in iron deficiency (Fig. 1C). Concomitant with the “blue shift” is an increase of the fluorescence emission as normalized to emission at 685 nm, indicating that excitation energy transfer between LHCI and PSI was strongly impaired. In the subsequent days, the fluorescence emission maximum remained “blue-shifted,” and the extent of fluorescence decreased toward day 5. A significant portion of the processed product of Lhca3 was already detectable after 2 days (Fig. 1A) and thus correlated with the drop in efficiency of excitation energy transfer between LHCI and PSI. In order to monitor the dynamic adaptation to iron deficiency, with a particular emphasis on the LHCI protein composition, we employed comparative quantitative proteomics. The Lhca Proteins Are Affected to Varying Degrees by Iron Deficiency—We took advantage of arginine auxotrophic Chlamydomonas cells, which were grown in the presence of l-Arg in iron-replete conditions and transferred for 5 days to iron-deficient conditions. In parallel, the auxotrophic cells were grown under iron-sufficient conditions in the presence of isotopically labeled l-Arg, harboring six 13C atoms. Chloroplasts were isolated from both conditions and separated into thylakoid and envelope membranes and stroma proteins. Thylakoid samples were mixed on an equal protein basis and separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). Protein bands as indicated in Fig. 3 were excised, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. In a first round of analyses, sequence identity and the presence of an Arg residue in the tryptic peptide was established by using the Sequest algorithm. In a second round of analyses, Arg-containing peptides were analyzed quantitatively. The selected peptide ion pairs (12C6-Arg/13C6-Arg) were fragmented concurrently (Fig. 2B). In the MS/MS spectrum, singly charged y ions can be distinguished by a mass difference of 6 or 3 Da in the case of doubly charged ions. These different y ions originating from the sister peptide ions were used for quantification by comparing the total ion count peak area of respective labeled and unlabeled fragment sister ions (Table I). Quantification using fragment ions rather than parent ions reduced background signals from unrelated peptide ions significantly, and in most cases nearly completely. The abundance of the peptides was based on the peak areas for several fragment ions. We also performed quantitative immunoblot analysis of thylakoid membranes isolated from iron-sufficient and 5-day iron-deficient cells using anti-Lhca3, anti-PsaD, and anti-CF1 antibodies (Fig. 2A). These analyses showed that the mature forms of Lhca3 and PsaD were down to 5–10% and 20–50%, respectively, whereas the ATPase was unaffected as reported before (4Moseley J.L. Allinger T. Herzog S. Hoerth P. Wehinger E. Merchant S. Hippler M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6709-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). More importantly, we used these immunoblot data to normalize the LC-MS/MS data for isotopically labeled peptides. By using the comparative quantitative assay, we investigated the N-terminal processing of Lhca3 (Fig. 3). Resolution of a singly charged y7 ion, derived from the MS/MS fragmentation of the Lhca3 peptide ion WLQYSEVIHAR[2H+], using the m/z filters 817.5–819.7 (for the labeled ion) and 811.5–813.7 (for the unlabeled ion), showed that the labeled peptide was present in the higher molecular weight band in iron-sufficient conditions but was absent from the lower molecular weight band, whereas the reverse is true for the unlabeled peptide. These data demonstrated that the processed form of Lhca3 was dominant under iron-deficient conditions, whereas the mature form was largely diminished under the same conditions. Resolution of the doubly charged y6 fragment ion from the MS/MS fragmentation of the peptide NILLNEGIR[2H+], originating from the PSII core subunit D2, showed nearly equal protein loading of the thylakoids isolated from iron-sufficient and -deficient conditions. Analysis of other y-type ions resulting from fragmentation of the Lhca3 or D2 peptide ions showed the same results (Table I). Consistent with the data for D2, analysis of CP43 peptides ions clearly indicated that PSII was not affected after 5 days of iron deficiency; however, the levels of D1 were slightly decreased with respect to iron-sufficient conditions. The ATPase subunits (AtpA and AtpB), as well as the major light-harvesting complex proteins Lhcbm (Table I) (all of which were used as loading controls), do not change significantly between iron-replete and -deficient conditions. Analysis of the PSI subunits PsaA, PsaB, PsaD, and PsaF showed that after 5 days in iron deficiency the PSI complex was down to about 45% with respect to iron-replete conditions (Table I). The impact of iron deficiency on LCHI was more dramatic. Besides the N-terminal processing of Lhca3, Lhca5 almost completely disappeared, and the amounts of Lhca1, Lhca7, and Lhca8 were reduced, whereas the Lhca4 and Lhca9 polypeptides were induced under iron-deficient conditions in respect to PSI (Table I). We confirmed the down-regulation of Lhca5 by immunoblotting using Lhca5-specific antibodies (31Hippler M. Klein J. Fink A. Allinger T. Hoerth P. Plant J. 2001; 28: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (data not shown). We also detected peptides of Lhca2 and Lhca6 by MS/MS, but did not obtain adequate resolution of fragment ions for quantification.Table IRelative abundance of proteins from the LHCI and the PSI core complex, the LHCII and the PSII core complex, and proteins from the ATP synthase (Fig. 3) isolated from thylakoids from cells grown in iron-deficient and iron-sufficient conditions, respectivelyProteinPeptideBandRatio Fe-/Fe+aRatios were normalized with immunoblot data (Fig. 2).S.D.bS.D. was calculated for different y ions, and for some peptides y-type ions from up to five independent measurements are presented.nLhca1FTESEVIHGR120.390.087Lhca3WLQYSEVIHAR9a0.020.018Lhca3WLQYSEVIHAR100.170.056Lhca3 N-terminal processedWLQYSEVIHAR10a10.965.266Lhca4WYAQAELMNAR91.130.264Lhca5QSELQHAR9a0.030.033Lhca7FFDPMGLSR110.310.264WYVQAELVHGR11<0.01<0.013Average of two peptides0.150.22Lhca8WYQQAELIHCR110.070.032Lhca9GALAGDNGFDPLGLGQDEGR121.690.678PsaADYDPTNNYNNLLDR30.450.144PsaBDKPVALSIVQAR30.340.033FSQGLAQDPTTR30.590.333Average of two peptides0.470.15PsaDEQIFEMPTGGAAIMR130.550.204PsaFEENITVSPR130.380.003Lhcbm1-10ELELIHAR100.900.199D1VLNTWADIINR60.630.124FGQEEETYNIVAAHGYFGR60.820.314Average of two peptides0.720.13D2NILLNEGIR70.830.093AFNPTQAEETYSMVTANR71.260.354AYDFVSQEIR71.020.523Average o"

Stimulation of the human A3 receptor has been suggested to influence cell death and proliferation. The phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt and the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) kinase (MEK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways have central roles in the regulation of cell survival and proliferation. Due to their importance, the cross-talk between these two pathways has been investigated. Here, we show that the A3 adenosine receptor agonist Cl-IB-MECA stimulates PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt leading to the reduction of basal levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which in turn inhibits cell proliferation. The response to Cl-IB-MECA was not blocked by A1, A2A, or A2B receptor antagonists, although it was abolished by A3 receptor antagonists. Furthermore, the response to Cl-IB-MECA was generated at the cell surface, since the inhibition of A3 receptor expression, by using small interfering RNA, abolished agonist effects. Using A375 cells, we show that A3 adenosine receptor stimulation results in PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt, leading to the reduction of basal levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which in turn inhibits cell proliferation.

Recent studies have hypothesized a role of adenosine in promoting the development and growth of tumor masses (1Merighi S. Mirandola P. Varani K. Gessi S. Leung E. Baraldi P.G. Tabrizi M.A. Borea P.A.

An increasing amount of work suggests a contradictory role of adenosine in the viability of the normal and cancer cells (1Merighi S. Mirandola P. Varani K. Gessi S. Leung E. Baraldi P.G.

General opinion is that adenosine's antithetic behavior is due to the stimulation of the four adenosine receptor subtypes named A1, A2A, A2B, and A3, which are coupled to opposite signal transduction pathways (4Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar, 5Fredholm B.B. Ijzerman A.P. Jacobson K.A. Klotz K.N. Linden J. Pharmacol.

In particular, it has been demonstrated that A3 adenosine receptor agonists (the natural ligand adenosine and synthetic analogues) protect cells from apoptosis and interfere with cell proliferation (7Fishman P.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). One of the different mechanisms through which A3 adenosine receptors are able to inhibit cell proliferation was found to involve inhibition of telomerase activity and a cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, leading to a cytostatic effect (7Fishman P.

Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that the antigrowth signal exerted by A3 receptors blocks cells into G1-late cell cycle phase (9Merighi S. Mirandola P. Milani D. Varani K. Gessi S. Klotz K.N.

Prompted by the antiproliferative effect of A3 adenosine receptor stimulation, adenosine derivatives have been examined in vivo for their ability to suppress tumor growth with success demonstrated in different experimental tumor models in mice (15Bar-Yehuda S.

The activation of this Gi-coupled receptor increases Ca2+ intracellular levels and decreases cAMP concentration (17Linden J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

On the other hand, it has been reported that A3 stimulation correlates with the protein kinase A, Akt, c-myc, and cyclin D down-regulation (19Fishman P. Madi L. Bar-Yehuda S. Barer F. Del Valle L. Khalili K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4060-4064Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The other branch of the adenosine signaling cascade has been demonstrated with studies performed in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human A3 adenosine receptor (CHO-A3) (20Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 21Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. Mol.

Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1051-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These studies show that A3 receptor signaling in CHO cells leads to stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activity (20Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 21Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In particular, A3 receptor signaling to ERK1/2 depends on βγ release from pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, PI3K, Ras, and MEK (21Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Functional A3 receptors activating ERK1/2 have been also described in microglia cells (24Hammarberg C. Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1051-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Together, the Ras-MEK-ERK1/2 and the PI3K-Akt routes form the two major branches of intracellular adenosine A3 receptor signaling. It should be noted that PI3K might be upstream/downstream of Ras, thus regulating ERK1/2. As for A3 receptors, it has been demonstrated that Ras, in CHO-A3 cells, is activated downstream of PI3K (21Schulte G. Fredholm B.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused on the regulation of both Akt and ERK1/2 by A3 receptors, to gain more insight into adenosine signal transduction. We studied the dynamics between these two routes by use of specific inhibitors. We present a molecular mechanism able to explain the antiproliferative activity of a selective agonist of A3 adenosine receptor, Cl-IB-MECA, by using the human melanoma cell line A375 (25Klotz K.N. Camaioni E. Volpini R. Kachler S. Vittori S. Cristalli G. Naunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 360: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A375 cells were chosen because the expression and the active functional role of all adenosine receptor subtypes has been firmly established and, furthermore, the singular role of the A3 receptor in cell survival and proliferation has been evaluated (9Merighi S.

Thus, we have inquired into the ability of the A3 adenosine receptor to modulate the MEK/ERK1/2 and the PI3K/Akt pathways, focusing our study on the cross-talk signaling that has been demonstrated to be present in several cellular systems (26Rommel C.

Using A375 cells, we show that A3 adenosine receptor stimulation results in PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt, leading to the reduction of basal levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels, which in turn inhibits cell proliferation. A375 cells were obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). Tissue culture media and growth supplements were obtained from Cambrex (Bergamo, Italy). Anti-ACTIVE®MAPK and anti-ERK1/2 (pAb) were from Promega (Milano, Italy). Anti-adenosine A3 receptor (pAb) was from Aviva Antibody Corp. (DBA; Milano, Italy). Phospho-Raf (Ser259) (Ser259 on Raf is an inhibitory phosphorylation site), phospho-Akt (Ser473), phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221), and MEK1/2 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Celbio; Milano, Italy). Anti-adenosine A2A receptor (pAb) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (DBA; Milano, Italy). Unless otherwise noted, all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. A375 cells were grown adherently and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm)at37 °Cin 5% CO2, 95% air. Cells were passaged two or three times weekly at a ratio between 1:5 and 1:10. Cells were collected and stained with 0.4% of trypan blue for 5 min at room temperature before being examined under the microscope. The number of viable cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion. The dead cells that stained blue were scored positive and counted against the total number of cells to determine the percentage of cell death. The number of living cells was determined by evaluating the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity by using MTT that is converted into a formazan product in living cells. 105 cells were plated in 24-multiwell plates; 500 μl of complete medium were added to each well with different concentrations of Cl-IB-MECA. The cells were then incubated for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, 50 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml) were added to each well. The plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and then 550 μl of an acid propanol solution (0.1 n HCl in isopropyl alcohol) were added to each well to dissolve the formazan. The optical density of each well was read on a spectrophotometer at 570 nm. For each experiment, four individual wells of each drug concentration were prepared. Each experiment was repeated three times. The intracellular ATP concentration was determined with a luminescent ATP detection kit (ATPLite-M; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. Light units generated by ATP in each sample were normalized to control (solution with known ATP concentration) and expressed as the absolute ATP levels. Cell Proliferation Test—Cells were seeded in fresh medium with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm) and simultaneously treated with adenosine analogues. After different times of labeling, cells were trypsinized, dispensed in four wells of a 96-well plate, and filtered through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters using a Micro-Mate 196 cell harvester (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The filter-bound radioactivity was counted on Top Count Microplate Scintillation Counter (efficiency 57%) with Micro-Scint 20. JAM Test—This assay measures cell death by quantifying the amount of fragmented DNA. Target cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 20 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), l-glutamine (2 mm). The cells were then washed and treated with new unlabeled medium containing adenosine analogues for 24 h. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were trypsinized and dispensed in four wells of a 96-well plate, filtered through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters using a Micro-Mate 196 cell harvester (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The filter-bound radioactivity was counted on Top Count Microplate Scintillation Counter (efficiency 57%) with Micro-Scint 20. The amount of apoptotic and necrotic cells, measured as the loss of radioactivity associated with the loss of fragmented and degraded DNA, was detected by filtration and subsequent washing with a Micro-Mate 196 cell harvester followed by quantification with a Top Count Microplate Scintillation Counter. The percentage of cell death is expressed as 100 × (dpm(U) - dpm(T))/dpm(U), where dpm(U) represents the radioactivity of untreated cells and dpm(T) is the radioactivity of treated cells (9Merighi S. Mirandola P. Milani D. Varani K. Gessi S. Klotz K.N. Leung E. Baraldi P.G. Borea P.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 923-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A375 cells (1.5 × 105) were seeded into 6-mm plates and cultured for 16 h before the addition of 10 μm Cl-IB-MECA. At various incubation times (0, 3, 8, 16, and 24 h), attached and floating cells were harvested and resuspended with cold PBS for immediate treatment and analysis of propidium iodide incorporation and annexin-V-fluorescein labeling, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Annexin-V-FLUOS staining kit; Roche Applied Science). Triplicate samples for each experimental condition were analyzed using FL2 and FL1 channels, respectively, of a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). To recover all seeded cells, the adherent culture fraction was trypsinized and mixed with the supernatant fraction. Then the cell suspension was spun to a slide by Cytospin 3 cytocentrifuge (Shandon) at 250 rpm for 10 min. As previously described (30Merighi S. Mirandola P. Varani K. Gessi S. Capitani S. Leung E. Baraldi P.G. Tabrizi M.A. Borea P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized in PBS solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and the DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Slides were mounted in DABCO glycerol-PBS and observed on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope. A375 adherent cells were trypsinized, mixed with floating cells, washed with PBS, and permeabilized in 70% (v/v) ethanol/PBS solution at 4 °C for at least 24 h. Cells were washed with PBS, and the DNA was stained with a PBS solution, containing 20 μg/ml of propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml of RNase, at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were analyzed with an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL), and the content of DNA was evaluated by the Cell-LISYS program (BD Biosciences). Cell distribution among cell cycle phases and the percentage of apoptotic cells were evaluated as previously described (30Merighi S. Mirandola P. Varani K. Gessi S. Capitani S. Leung E. Baraldi P.G. Tabrizi M.A. Borea P.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell cycle distribution is shown as the percentage of cells containing 2n (G0/G1 phases), 4n (G2 and M phases), 4n > x > 2n DNA amount (S phase) judged by propidium iodide staining. The apoptotic population is the percentage of cells with DNA content lower than 2n. To generate a small interfering RNA that targets A3 receptor mRNA (siRNAA3), eight oligonucleotides consisting of ribonucleosides, except for the presence of 2′-deoxyribonucleosides at the 3′ end, were synthesized and annealed, according to the recommendations of Elbashir (31Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Silencer™ siRNA construction kit; Ambion) and as previously described (32Mirandola P. Ponti C. Gobbi G. Sponzilli I. Vaccarezza M. Cocco L. Zauli G. Secchiero P. Manzoli F.A. Vitale M. Blood. 2004; 104: 2418-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). For oligo-1, the sense sequence was 5′-GCU UAC CGU CAG AUA CAA GUU-3′, and antisense was 5′-CUU GUA UCU GAC GGU AAG CUU-3′. For oligo-2, sense sequence was 5′-GAC GGC UAA GUC CUU GUU UUU-3′, and antisense was 5′-AAA CAA GGA CUU AGC CGU CUU-3′. For oligo-3, sense sequence was 5′-ACA CUU GAG GGC CUG UAU GUU-3′, and antisense was 5′-CAU ACA GGC CCU CAA GUG UUU-3′. For oligo-4, sense sequence was 5′-CCU GCU CUC GGA GGA UGC CUU-3′, and antisense was 5′-GGC AUC CUC CGA GAG CAG GUU-3′. Target sequences were aligned to the human genome data base in a BLAST search to ensure sequences without significant homology to other genes. The target sequences for oligo-1, oligo-2, oligo-3, and oligo-4 are localized at positions 337, 679, 1009, and 1356 bases downstream of the start codon of A3 receptor mRNA sequence (L20463), respectively. A375 cells were plated in 6-well plates and grown to 50-70% confluence before transfection. Transfection of siRNA was performed at a concentration of 100 nm using RNAiFect™ Transfection Kit (Qiagen). Cells were cultured in complete media, and at 24, 48, and 72 h total RNA was isolated for real time RT-PCR analysis of A3 receptor mRNA and for Western blot analysis of A3 receptor protein. To quantify cell transfection efficiency, we used fluorescein-labeled siRNA (Qiagen). After 24 h of transfection, cells were tripsinized and resuspended in PBS for flow cytometry analysis. Fluorescence obtained from FITC-siRNA-transfected cells was compared with autofluorescence generated by untransfected control. A nonspecific random control ribonucleotide sense strand (5′-ACU CUA UCU GCA CGC UGA CdTdT-3′) and antisense strand (5′-dTdT UGA GAU AGA CGU GCG ACU G-3′) were used under identical conditions. Total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate phenol method (33Chomaczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative real time RT-PCR assay (34Higuchi R. Fockler C. Dollinger G. Watson R. Biotechnology. 1993; 11: 1026-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar) of A3 mRNA transcript was carried out using gene-specific double fluorescently labeled TaqMan MGB probe (minor groove binder) in an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK) (35Gessi S. Cattabriga E. Avitabile A. Gafa' R. Lanza G. Cavazzini L. Bianchi N. Gambari R. Feo C. Liboni A. Gullini S. Leung E. Mac Lennan S. Borea P.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 5895-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The following primer and probe sequences were used for real time RT-PCR: A3 forward primer, 5′-ATG CCT TTG GCC ATT GTT G-3′; A3 reverse primer, 5′-ACA ATC CAC TTC TAC AGC TGC CT-3′; A3 MGB probe, 5′-FAM-TCA GCC TGG GCA TC-TAMRA-3′ (where the fluorescent reporter FAM and the quencher TAMRA are 6-carboxyl fluorescein and 6-carboxyl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylrhodamine, respectively). For the real time RT-PCR of the reference gene, the endogenous control human β-actin kit was used, and the probe was fluorescence-labeled with VIC™ (Applied Biosystems, Monza, Italy). After serum deprivation (growth medium without serum) overnight, A375 cells were treated with adenosine analogues for different times (2-24 h). Cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 104 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 0.08 mm aprotinin, 2 mm leupeptin, 4 mm bestatin, 1.5 mm pepstatin A, 1.4 mm E-64. Cells were then lysed in Triton lysis buffer. The protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Aliquots of total protein sample (50 μg) were analyzed using antibodies specific for phosphorylated (Thr183/Tyr185) or total ERK-1/ERK-2 MAPK (1:5000 dilution); for phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221) and total MEK1/2 (1:1000 dilution); for phosphorylated (Ser259) Raf (1:1000 dilution); for phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) (1:1000 dilution); and for A2A or A3 receptor (1 μg/ml dilution). Filters were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:2000 dilution). Specific reactions were revealed with Enhanced Chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were then stripped and reprobed with tubulin (1:250) to ensure equal protein loading. Cells were treated for 30 min with metabolic inhibitors or with drug vehicle (Me2SO) prior to being challenged with adenosine analogues. U0126 was used as inhibitor of MEK-1 and MEK-2 to prevent ERK-1 and ERK-2 MAPK activation. LY294002 was used as an inhibitor of PI3K, U73122 as an inhibitor of PLC, and SH6 as an inhibitor of Akt (Akt-I; Vinci-Biochem). Raf-1 Ras-binding domain (RBD) fragment (Raf-1 amino acid residues 1-149) fused to glutathione S-transferase was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Ras-GTP from various treated lysates was “pulled down” using the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein corresponding to the human Ras binding domain of Raf-1 bound to agarose. The activated Ras affinity precipitation assay was performed as described according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, A375 melanoma cells were serum-starved for 24 h, treated with Cl-IB-MECA at different concentrations (0.1-10 μm) for different times (from 5 to 60 min), washed twice with cold PBS, and lysed with Mg2+ lysis/wash buffer. Then the lysate was incubated with 10 μg of Raf-1 RBD-conjugated agarose at 4 °C for 30 min. Raf-1 RBD-conjugated agarose specifically binds to and precipitates Ras-GTP from cell lysates. After washing the beads three times with Mg2+ lysis/wash buffer, they were suspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using 1 μg/ml anti-Ras monoclonal antibody as a primary antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), and visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection system. The intensity of each band in immunoblot assay was quantified using molecular analyst/PC densitometry software (Bio-Rad). Mean densitometry data from independent experiments were normalized to control. The data were presented as the mean ± S.E. and analyzed by Student's t test. All values given throughout are expressed as means ± S.E. from three independent experiments except where indicated. Data sets were examined by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett's test (when required). A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Cl-IB-MECA Inhibits Cell Proliferation and ERK1/2 Activation—In this study, we investigated the functionality of A3 adenosine receptors expressed in A375 human melanoma cells by using the selective adenosine analogue Cl-IB-MECA (25Klotz K.N. Camaioni E. Volpini R. Kachler S. Vittori S. Cristalli G. Naunyn Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1999; 360: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A375 cells were treated in the presence of increasing concentrations (0.1-10 μm) of Cl-IB-MECA for 24 h, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured. As shown in Fig. 1A, Cl-IB-MECA induced a reduction in [3H]thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 = 1.2 ± 0.3 μm. Similar results were obtained with another A3 adenosine receptor agonist, IB-MECA (data not shown). By using the MTT assay, we observed that Cl-IB-MECA produced small but reproducible antiproliferative effects (Fig. 1B). To evaluate whether the reduced number of viable cells quantified by [3H]thymidine incorporation and MTT was due to a cell death or to a proliferative block, we determined the cell toxicity of the agonist Cl-IB-MECA on melanoma cells. To this aim, we treated A375 cells with 5 and 10 μm Cl-IB-MECA for 24 h and determined the cell viability by the trypan blue exclusion method. Cl-IB-MECA treatment did not significantly affect cell viability under the experimental conditions (cell viability of Cl-IB-MECA-treated cells was 97 ± 3% when compared with untreated cells), suggesting that the decrease in the cell number after the treatment with the A3 receptor agonist Cl-IB-MECA was not caused by an increase of cell death. To confirm these results, we analyzed the effect of A3 adenosine receptor stimulation on cell survival by the JAM test. A375 cells, previously labeled with [3H]thymidine, were treated for 24 h with increasing concentrations of Cl-IB-MECA. A3 receptor stimulation did not induce cell death, as shown in Fig. 1C. To further investigate the effect of A3 receptor stimulation on cell viability, we measured the intracellular ATP content of A375 cells (12 ± 1 nmol/106 cells). ATP content after Cl-IB-MECA treatment was determined and normalized to the remaining cell numbers. We found that Cl-IB-MECA did not modify the intracellular concentration of ATP (13 ± 2 nmol/106 cells, 10 μm for 24 h). We also investigated cellular morphology of A375 drug-treated cells. The morphological analysis revealed the absence of mitotic figures (data not shown). To further confirm the absence of cell death under these conditions, we studied a typical event of apoptosis, namely the presence of phosphatidylserine at the outer face of the plasma membrane, in cells cultured in the presence of 10 μm Cl"
https://openalex.org/W2048597432,"RNA interference (RNAi) treatment of monkey COS-7 cells, a cell line that lacks nonmuscle myosin heavy chain II-A (NMHC II-A) but contains NMHC II-B and II-C, was used to investigate the participation of NMHC isoforms in cytokinesis. We specifically suppressed the expression of NMHC II-B or II-C using 21 nucleotide small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes. Down-regulation of NMHC II-B protein expression to 10.2 ± 0.7% inhibited COS-7 cell proliferation by 50% in the RNAi-treated cells compared with control cells. Moreover, whereas 8.7 ± 1.0% of control cells were multinucleated, 62.4 ± 8.8% of the NMHC II-B RNAi-treated cells were multinucleated 72 h after transfection. The RNAi-treated cells had increased surface areas and, unlike control cells, lacked actin stress fibers. Treatment of the COS-7 cells with NMHC II-C siRNA decreased NMHC II-C expression to 5.2 ± 0.1% compared with the endogenous content of II-C; however, down-regulation of NMHC II-C did not cause increased multinucleation. Immunoblot analysis using a pan-myosin antibody showed that the content of NMHC II-C was less than one-twentieth the amount of NMHC II-B, thereby explaining the lack of response to II-C siRNA. Introducing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged NMHC II isoforms into II-B siRNA-treated cells resulted in reduction of multinucleation from 62.4 ± 8.8% to 17.8 ± 2.2% using GFP-NMHC II-B, to 29.8 ± 7.4% using GFP-NMHC II-A, and to 34.1 ± 8.6% using NMHC II-C-GFP. These studies have shown that expression of endogenous NMHC II-C in COS-7 cells is insufficient for normal cytokinesis and that exogenous NMHC II-A and NMHC II-C can, at least partially, rescue the defect in cytokinesis due to the loss of NMHC II-B.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 21Matsumura F. Ono S. Yamakita Y. Totsukawa G. Yamashiro S. J.

However, it is not yet known whether the three different isoforms of the NMHC can substitute for one another in mammalian cells. To investigate the participation of NMHC II isoforms in regulating cytokinesis, we specifically down-regulated NMHC II-B or II-C expression by using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in COS-7 cells, a cell line that lacks NMHC II-A but contains NMHC II-B as well as II-C. We found that down-regulation of NMHC II-B, but not NMHC II-C, induced a defect in cytokinesis, but not karyokinesis, which is characterized by decreased cell numbers with increased multinucleation. This defect in COS-7 cells can be rescued by NMHC II-B and to a lesser extent by NMHC II-A and II-C. DNA Constructs and RNA Oligonucleotides—GFP-tagged NMHC II-A and II-B plasmids were obtained from Dr. Qize Wei (Laboratory of Molecular Cardiology, NHLBI, NIH). NMHC II-C expression vector with GFP tagged at the N or C terminus was constructed by insertion of full-length mouse NMHC II-C into SalI/BamHI sites of enhanced GFP-C3 or enhanced GFP-N3 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). In the course of these experiments, we were informed by Dr. Thomas Egelhoff (Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland) of a number of mutations in our original GFP-NMHC II-A and II-B constructs, originally reported by Wei and Adelstein (24Wei Q. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3617-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We, therefore, with the help of Dr. Egelhoff, corrected both constructs and redid the rescue experiments with the corrected constructs. We found no difference in our results. The uncorrected constructs have been used by a number of investigators (24Wei Q. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3617-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Lo C.M. Buxton D.B.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and found to localize properly and also to rescue phenotypes caused by depletion of NMHC II-B. NMHC II-B siRNA duplexes (directed at both the human, RefSeq accession number NM_005964, and monkey sequence, AAGGAUCGCUACUAUUCAGGA) and NMHC II-C siRNA (directed at the mouse sequence, RefSeq accession number NM_028021, UCCGUCAGCACCGUGUCUUAU) were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO) and Qiagen (Valencia, CA), respectively. Control siRNA nonsense duplex (GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCG) and fluorescein-labeled control siRNA (AAUUCUTCCGAACGUGUCACGU) were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. and Qiagen, respectively. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from a monkey COS-7 cell line using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was carried out on 2 μg of total RNA in a final volume of 50 μl using random hexamer primers and the GeneAmpRNA PCR core kit (Applied Biosystems, Branchburg, NJ). PCRs were performed on 2 μl of reaction mixture in the presence of 1 mm dNTPs, 10 pmol primers, and 2.5 units of Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers for NMHC II-B were designed according to the human MYH10 sequence (RefSeq accession number NM_005964), and Blast searches showed that they should not anneal with MYH9 (RefSeq accession number NM_002473) or MYH14 (RefSeq accession number NM_024729). The primers used for NMHC II-C were forward primer, 5′-ATGCTGCAGGATCGTGAGGACC, and reverse primer, 5′-ATGAATTTGCCGAATCGGGAGG. The gel-purified PCR products were subcloned using a PCR-Script Amp cloning kit (Stratagene), and different clones were isolated for sequence analysis. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfections with siRNA and DNA constructs were carried out using Nucleofector kits according to the manufacturer's instruction (amaxa GmbH, Koeln, Germany) when cells were 60-70% confluent. By using fluorescein-conjugated siRNA, we observed that more than 95% of the COS-7 cells were transfected with siRNA. For GFP-tagged NMHC constructs, the transfection efficiency was about 30%. Immunoblot Analysis—Cultured COS-7 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 1% by volume protease inhibitor mix containing 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, E-64, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin (Sigma) at 4 °C. The lysates were sedimented at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernates were analyzed by immunoblotting as previously described (27Buxton D.B. Golomb E. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15449-15455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The antibodies were anti-rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the C terminus of human NMHC II-A, II-B, and both human and mouse II-C, which were described previously (5Golomb E. Ma X. Jana S.S. Preston Y.A. Kawamoto S. Shoham N.G. Goldin E. Conti M.A. Sellers J.R. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2800-2808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and the monoclonal pan-anti-myosin II antibody (M2.42), which recognizes an epitope in the globular head of Acanthamoeba myosin II and was a generous gift from Don Kaiser and Thomas D. Pollard (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). We confirmed its equal reactivity to all three NMHC II isoforms by immunoblotting using baculovirus-expressed purified heavy meromyosin fragments (data not shown). Monoclonal antibodies to β-actin were from Sigma and α-tubulin from Santa Cruz. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgGs (Pierce, Rockford, IL) were used as secondary antibodies. The proteins were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Immunoblots were quantified using a Personal Densitometer S1 (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Growth Analysis—24 h after transfection, II-B siRNA-treated or control COS-7 cells were replated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 12-well culture plates. The cells were trypsinized and harvested every 24 h, and the number of cells was counted using a hemocytometer in the presence of 0.4% trypan blue. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were washed several times in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton ×-100. For antibody staining, the samples were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 4% normal goat serum for 30 min at 23 °C, incubated with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies to NMHC II-A, II-B, or II-C at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with the appropriate Texas Red- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2 phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Phalloidin conjugated to rhodamine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used to visualize F-actin. The images were collected using a Leica SP confocal microscope. NMHC II-B siRNA Reduces II-B Expression—To down-regulate NMHC II-B expression in COS-7 cells, we treated the cells with 21-nucleotide siRNA that were specific for mRNA encoding monkey NMHC II-B. Control cells were transfected with a nonsense duplex (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using fluorescein-labeled control siRNA, we estimated that more than 95% of the cells were transfected. Scanning of immunoblots showed that NMHC II-B protein was decreased at 48 h and that the lowest content was found at 96 h following transfection (Fig. 1, A and B). After that, the protein level increased and was restored to control levels by 144 h. The data from immunoblot analysis are quantitated in Fig. 1B. Fig. 1C shows that there was no compensatory increase in NMHC II-A expression and no change in the protein expression level of NMHC II-C at 72 and 96 h. NMHC II-B siRNA Inhibits Cytokinesis—To determine whether there was a change in cytokinesis in NMHC II-B down-regulated cells, we first investigated their replication (Fig. 2A). Following replating of equal numbers of nonsense or II-B siRNA-treated cells 24 h after transfection, the cells were counted every 24 h until 144 h. Between 96-144 h, there was a 2-fold or greater decrease in the number of II-B siRNA-treated cells compared with nonsense siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2A). When NMHC II-B siRNA-treated cells were replated at a later time, such as 144 h after transfection (when NMHC II-B expression had returned to control levels), there was no obvious difference in cell number between II-B siRNA-treated and nonsense siRNA-treated cells (data not shown), indicating that the decrease in cell proliferation is due to the decrease in II-B expression (Fig. 1B). Results from confocal microscopy (Fig. 2B) revealed a significant increase in multinucleated cells in the NMHC II-B siRNA-treated cells as quantitated at 72 and 96 h (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that NMHC II-B siRNA treatment induces a defect in cytokinesis, but not karyokinesis, similar to the finding by De Lozanne and Spudich (28De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) for Dictyostelium discoideum in myosin II-ablated cells. Loss of Actin Stress Fibers in NMHC II-B siRNA-treated Cells—In contrast to nonsense siRNA-transfected cells, the NMHC II-B siRNA-treated cells lost their actin stress fibers except possibly in the cortical areas. Confocal microscopy showed that 72 h after transfection, NMHC II-B siRNA-treated cells had increased surface areas (Fig. 3, g and h) compared with nonsense siRNA-treated cells (c and d) and, instead of forming stress fibers, small filaments of actin were diffusely distributed throughout the cell (compare panels g and c). There was no difference in α-tubulin localization between the II-B siRNA-treated and nonsense siRNA-treated cells (data not shown). NMHC II-C siRNA Reduces II-C Expression but Does Not Induce Multinucleation—We then studied the effect of using siRNA to reduce NMHC II-C in COS-7 cells, because this was the only other NMHC II isoform present in these cells. Fig. 4A shows that, unlike the results found using NMHC II-B siRNA, reducing NMHC II-C protein to 5.2 ± 0.1% of that of nonsense siRNA-treated cells did not result in increased multinucleation (Fig. 4B). In addition, unlike II-B siRNA-treated cells, which lost actin stress fibers (see above), there was no loss of stress fibers in II-C siRNA-treated cells (data not shown). We interpreted these results to mean that either NMHC II-C does not play a role in cytokinesis in COS-7 cells or the amount of endogenous NMHC II-C is so small compared with endogenous NMHC II-B that reducing it has no overall effect on cytokinesis. We, therefore, used a pan-myosin antibody to help determine the relative amounts of NMHC II-B and II-C in COS-7 cells. Fig. 4C provides quantitative evidence that NMHC II-C makes up only a small percent of the myosin II isoforms present in COS-7 cells. The immunoblot shows the results of treating COS-7 cells with either nonsense siRNA oligonucleotides (Fig. 4C, lane 1) or siRNA specific for NMHC II-B (lane 2) or siRNA directed at NMHC II-C (lane 3). We analyzed the same blot using three different antibodies: a pan-myosin II antibody, which shows similar reactivity to all three NMHC II isoforms, and the specific antibodies to NMHC II-C and II-B used above. The immunoblot of the pan-myosin II antibodies shows that the siRNA to II-B lowered the amount of total myosin II substantially more than did the siRNA directed at NMHC II-C. Probing the immunoblot with antibodies to NMHC-II-C and II-B confirmed that the siRNAs used were effective in lowering the protein levels of each isoform. By measuring the intensity of each band, we estimated that the amount of NMHC II-C in COS-7 cells is less than 5% of the total NMHC II. This could explain the inability of NMHC II-C siRNA to cause multinucleation in the COS-7 cells. To further examine this possibility as well as to address the ability of each isoform to effect multinucleation, we carried out rescue experiments. Rescue of Multinucleation in NMHC II-B-deficient Cells by Various NMHC II Isoforms—We evaluated the ability of each NMHC II isoform to rescue the defect in cytokinesis caused by NMHC II-B down-regulation. We did this by introducing each of the full-length NMHC II isoforms tagged with GFP into the cells that had been previously treated with NMHC II-B siRNA for 24 h. Because this was our initial use of GFP-labeled NMHC II-C in transfection experiments, we used constructs having GFP at both the N terminus (GFP-NMHC II-C) and C terminus (NMHC II-C-GFP). Following transfection of the NMHC II-B siRNA-treated cells with the GFP-labeled NMHC II isoforms, the COS-7 cells were cultured for an additional 48 h and then the extent of multinucleation was quantitated. These experiments were carried out under conditions that normalized the transfection efficiency of all three GFP-NMHC isoforms to 30% of the cells transfected, using the GFP signal viewed by confocal microscopy as an indicator. Fig. 5A depicts images from confocal microscopy showing COS-7 cells following transfection. These data confirm the absence of NMHC II-B at 72 h in the siRNA-treated cells that were subsequently transfected with GFP alone (Fig. 5A, a-d), whereas the GFP-II-B panels (e-h) show the expression of the newly introduced NMHC II-B as detected by both GFP and an antibody to NMHC II-B. GFP II-A panels (i-l), GFP II-C (N-terminal; m-p), and II-C GFP (C-terminal; q-t) show the results of transfecting these constructs into the siRNA NMHC II-B-treated cells as detected by the GFP signal. Of note is the absence of NMHC II-B in each of these siRNA-treated cells at this time with the exception of those cells that were transfected with GFP-NMHC II-B (panel g). Unlike NMHC II-C GFP (C-terminal), which showed a normal filamentous structure in COS-7 cells (panel r), GFP II-C (N-terminal) exhibited a punctate structure (panel n), leading us to conclude that GFP at the N terminus of NMHC II-C forms aggregates of myosin. Fig. 5B shows quantitation of the extent of multinucleation in the siRNA-treated cells that were subsequently transfected with GFP alone or GFP-NMHCs. Control cells transfected with nonsense siRNA displayed low numbers of multinucleated cells (8.7%), similar to untreated cells. On the other hand, NMHC II-B siRNA-treated cells transfected with GFP alone displayed an increased number of multinucleated cells (66% of the COS-7 cells found to contain the GFP signal were multinucleated). NMHC II-B siRNA-transfected cells subsequently transfected with GFP-NMHC II-A showed a decrease in multinucleation to 30% compared with 66% of the cells transfected with GFP alone and a decrease to 18% for the GFP-NMHC II-B-transfected cells at 72 h. Interestingly, NMHC II-C-GFP (C-terminal) decreased II-B siRNA-induced multinucleation to 34%. In contrast, GFP-NMHC II-C (N-terminal) was ineffectual in rescuing the defect in cytokinesis, as 62% of these cells remained multinucleated following transfection. The inability of GFP-NMHC II-C (N-terminal) to rescue multinucleation was consistent with its failure to localize to filaments in COS-7 cells (Fig. 5A, panel n). One explanation for the inability of endogenous NMHC II-C to prevent multinucleation (see above) and for the ability of NMHC II-C GFP to partially rescue the siRNA II-B-treated cells is that the amount of endogenous NMHC II-C is considerably smaller than the amount of NMHC II-C-GFP introduced to rescue the COS-7 cells. Fig. 5C shows that this is the case using immunoblot analysis. The figure shows that the expression level of NMHC II-C in the cells transfected with NMHC II-C-GFP is at least 10-fold greater (lane 3) compared with endogenous NMHC II-C (controls, lane 1), taking into account the 30% transfection efficiency. Note that introducing NMHC II-B siRNA + GFP did not alter II-C expression (lane 2). We examined the formation of actin stress fibers in the cells transfected with each GFP-tagged NMHC II isoform. As shown in Fig. 6, both GFP-NMHC II-A and II-B, as well as NMHC II-C-GFP (C-terminal), introduced into the COS-7 cells led to the formation of actin stress fibers (panels b, e, and k). However, GFP-NMHC II-C (N-terminal) did not cause formation of stress fibers (panel h). Taken together, the data indicate that NMHC II-A, II-B, and II-C can at least partially rescue the defect in cytokinesis induced by II-B siRNA. These data also show that the amount of endogenous NMHC II-C following NMHC II-B siRNA treatment is not sufficient to support normal cytokinesis in COS-7 cells. In this study, we have shown that NMHC II-A and II-C can partially rescue a defect in cytokinesis induced by down-regulation of NMHC II-B. We also provided evidence that the total amount of myosin II appears to play a role in cytokinesis: we observed no increase in multinucleation following the down-regulation of NMHC II-C, but when we introduced substantially more of the NMHC II-C isoform into cells that were depleted for NMHC II-B we were able to decrease multinucleation from 66 to 34%. Under these conditions, NMHC II-C localizes to the contractile ring (data not shown). Thus, decreasing endogenous NMHC II-C using siRNA would not affect cytokinesis because the amount of NMHC II-C is only a small fraction of total NMHC II. We confirmed this by using siRNA directed against NMHC II-B and II-C to lower both isoforms at the same time. We found no increase in the amount of multinucleation compared with cells treated with siRNA directed against NMHC II-B alone (data not shown). COS-7 cells resemble mammalian cardiac myocytes in that they contain NMHC II-B and II-C, but not NMHC II-A. We have previously shown in in vivo experiments that ablation of NMHC II-B results in a partial defect in cytokinesis in mouse cardiac myocytes, but not in the nonmyocyte cells in the heart, which do contain NMHC II-A (29Takeda K. Kishi H. Ma X. Yu Z.-X. Adelstein R.S. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 330-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The loss of NMHC II-B results in a 70% decrease in the number of cardiac myocytes at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) and an increase in the number of binucleated myocytes from 1 to 23%. The results reported here support the ability of myosin II-C alone to prevent a complete failure in cytokinesis in the NMHC II-B-ablated cardiac myocytes. Of note was the difference between whether the GFP was attached to the C- or N-terminal end of the NMHC. A number of laboratories, including ours, have noted that N-terminal GFP-tagged-NMHC II-A or II-B localizes with the endogenous NMHC when transfected into cells (24Wei Q. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3617-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 25Lo C.M. Buxton D.B. Chua G.C. Dembo M. Adelstein R.S. Wang Y.L. Mol. Biol.

However, we noted that this was only the case for NMHC II-C when GFP was attached to the C-terminal residue and not when it was fused to the N-terminal end. Moreover, although the former construct was able to reduce multinucleation in COS-7 cells treated with NMHC II-B siRNA from 66 to 34%, the GFP-N-terminal construct was not able to reduce multinucleation to any significant extent. De Lozanne and Spudich (28De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) showed that ablation of non-muscle myosin II results in failure of cytokinesis, but not karyokinesis in Dictyostelium discoideum, provided they are grown in suspension culture. Grown on a surface, the cells can undergo division or cytofission by pulling themselves apart. COS-7, a monkey kidney cell line, apparently does not use this alternative form of cytokinesis because 68% of the cells became multinucleated following NMHC II-B siRNA treatment even though they were grown on a surface. Of particular note in the NMHC II-B-depleted cells was the loss of actin filaments (Fig. 3g). This may help to explain the altered, flattened morphology seen in these cells as well as the appearance of multinucleation because association of actin filaments with myosin II is required for contractile ring formation and progression of cytokinesis (30Schroeder T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 31Fujiwara K. Porter M.E. Pollard T.D. J.

This may simply reflect the differences in the biochemical properties among the isoforms. Recent work has shown that all three isoforms differ with respect both in their ability to propel actin filaments in an in vitro motility assay and in their actin-activated MgATPase activities (16Kovacs M.

https://openalex.org/W2047841805,"Mitochondria harbor a conserved proteolytic system that mediates the complete degradation of organellar proteins. ATP-dependent proteases, like a Lon protease in the matrix space and m- and i-AAA proteases in the inner membrane, degrade malfolded proteins within mitochondria and thereby protect the cell against mitochondrial damage. Proteolytic breakdown products include peptides and free amino acids, which are constantly released from mitochondria. It remained unclear, however, whether the turnover of malfolded proteins involves only ATP-dependent proteases or also oligopeptidases within mitochondria. Here we describe the identification of Mop112, a novel metallopeptidase of the pitrilysin family M16 localized in the intermembrane space of yeast mitochondria. This peptidase exerts important functions for the maintenance of the respiratory competence of the cells that overlap with the i-AAA protease. Deletion of MOP112 did not affect the stability of misfolded proteins in mitochondria, but resulted in an increased release from the organelle of peptides, generated upon proteolysis of mitochondrial proteins. We find that the previously described metallopeptidase saccharolysin (or Prd1) exerts a similar function in the intermembrane space. The identification of peptides released from peptidase-deficient mitochondria by mass spectrometry indicates a dual function of Mop112 and saccharolysin: they degrade peptides generated upon proteolysis of proteins both in the intermembrane and matrix space and presequence peptides cleaved off by specific processing peptidases in both compartments.

These results suggest that the turnover of mitochondrial proteins is mediated by the sequential action of ATP-dependent proteases and oligopeptidases, some of them localized in the intermembrane space. Mitochondria are essential organelles with central anabolic and catabolic functions. To maintain their homeostasis and thereby avoid cell damage, a precise control of the steady state levels of mitochondrial proteins is required. First, evidence for the presence of an independent proteolytic system within mitochondria came from early studies that revealed different turnover rates of proteins residing in different mitochondrial subcompartments (1Walker J.H. Burgess R.L. Mayer R.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 2Lipsky N.G. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8652-8657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many components of this system, often highly conserved throughout evolution, have been identified since then and found to exert crucial functions within mitochondria (3Bota D.A. Davies K.J. Mitochondrion. 2001; 1: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Van Dyck L. Langer T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 825-842Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). They control distinct steps in the biogenesis of mitochondria and selectively degrade misfolded and non-assembled polypeptides accumulating in the organelle. These could be non-assembled proteins, which accumulate in case of an imperfect coordination of nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression, or oxidatively damaged proteins progressively generated in aging cells. Quantitative measurements of mitochondrial protein turnover in logarithmically growing yeast cells suggested the degradation of up to 10% of the mitochondrial proteome per hour, most likely reflecting to a large extent misfolded or damaged proteins (5Augustin S. Nolden M. Müller S. Hardt O. Arnold I. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2691-2699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Central components of the proteolytic system of mitochondria are conserved ATP-dependent proteases that ensure the quality control of mitochondrial proteins in various subcompartments (3Bota D.A.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 674-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), and two AAA proteases in the inner membrane mediating the degradation of non-assembled membrane proteins (7Leonhard K.

Inactivation of ATP-dependent proteases causes severe phenotypes in various organisms including neurodegeneration in humans (13Atorino L. Silvestri L. Koppen M. Cassina L. Ballabio A. Marconi R.

These deficiencies might reflect the deleterious effect of malfolded polypeptides accumulating in the absence of the peptidases or impaired proteolysis of mitochondrial proteins with crucial regulatory functions. Proteolysis initiated by ATP-dependent proteases can lead to the complete degradation of mitochondrial proteins to amino acid residues. This was demonstrated by analyzing proteolytic breakdown products of non-assembled mitochondrial translation products by AAA proteases in the inner membrane of the mitochondria (16Desautels M. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1869-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 17Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, ∼30% of the proteolytic products represent peptides composed of up to ∼20 amino acid residues that are released from the organelle (17Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Two pathways for the export of peptides can be distinguished. The majority of mitochondrial translation products is degraded by the m-AAA protease on the matrix side of the inner membrane and subsequently transported across the inner membrane by the ABC-transporter Mdl1. Peptides generated upon proteolysis by the i-AAA protease accumulate in the intermembrane space from where they are set free from the organelle. It should be noted that peptide export is not restricted to proteolytic breakdown products of mitochondrially encoded proteins. Rather, peptides generated upon the ongoing turnover of mitochondrial proteins in various subcompartments appear to be permanently released from mitochondria (5Augustin S. Nolden M. Müller S. Hardt O. Arnold I. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2691-2699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The formation of peptides and amino acid residues upon proteolysis of mitochondrial proteins raises the question, which peptidases mediate the proteolytic breakdown? As ATP-dependent proteases are generally thought to degrade proteins only to peptides, the involvement of oligopeptidases appears likely. Several oligopeptidases have been identified but their function has been exclusively studied in vitro. These include mammalian neurolysin (18Oliveira V. Gatti R. Rioli V. Ferro E.S. Spisni A.

Biochem. 1987; 163: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), both metallopeptidases localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, and a novel metallopeptidase, zinc-MP, which is present in mitochondria and chloroplasts and was shown to degrade targeting peptides of nuclear-encoded preproteins in vitro (22Moberg P. Stahl A. Bhushan S. Wright S.J. Eriksson A.C. Bruce B.D. Glaser E. Plant J. 2003; 36: 616-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent characterization of the mitochondrial proteome of various organisms revealed the presence of additional oligopeptidases in mitochondria that include the bleomycin hydrolase Lap3 (23Sickmann A. Reinders J. Wagner Y. Joppich C. Zahedi R. Meyer H.E. Schonfisch B. Perschil I. Chacinska A. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13207-13212Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), however, their functional characterization remains to be elucidated. Here, we have identified a novel metallopeptidase, termed Mop112, in the intermembrane space of yeast mitochondria and characterized its role for the turnover of mitochondrial proteins. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Yeast cells were grown according to standard procedures at 30 °C in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) containing galactose (2%) or on lactate medium. All strains used in this study were derivatives of W303. The Δyme1 and Δoma1 strains have been described previously (8Leonhard K. Herrmann J.M. Stuart R.A. Mannhaupt G. Neupert W. Langer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4218-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 24Käser M. Kambacheld M. Kisters-Woike B. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46414-46423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The MOP112 gene was disrupted by PCR-mediated homologous recombination in W303-1B, Δmdl1 and Δyme1 cells using a disruption cassette harboring the KanMX6 gene (25Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). PRD1 was disrupted in W303-1A, Δmop112, Δyme1, and Δyme1Δmop112 cells using a HIS3MX6-containing cassette for homologous recombination (25Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). For expression in yeast, the MOP112 gene was amplified by PCR and cloned as a SmaI-PstI DNA fragment into the centromer-based plasmid YCplac111 harboring the ADH1 promoter. The resulting plasmid was used as a template to modify the MOP112 by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis employing the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following primer pairs were used: for generation of mop112H84Y, 5′-CCAGATTCCACTGGGGTCCCTTATATTCTAGAGCATACAACG-3′ and 5′-CGTTGTATGCTCTAGAATATAAGGGACCCCAGTGGAATCTGG-3′; for generation of mop112E87Q, 5′-GGGGTCCCTCATATTCTACAGCATACAACGTTGTGTGGGTC-3′ and 5′-GACCCACACAACGTTGTATGCTGTAGAATATGAGGGACCCC-3′; for generation of mop112H88Y, 5′-GGGGTCCCTCATATTCTAGAGTATACAACGTTGTGTGGGTCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGACCCACACAACGTTGTATACTCTAGAATATGAGGGACCCC-3′. Stability of Newly Imported Polypeptides in Isolated Mitochondria— Mitochondria were isolated as previously described (26Diekert K. de Kroon A.I.P.M. Kispal G. Lill R. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 37-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After in vitro transcription of the genes using SP6-DNA polymerase, precursor proteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. Import of precursor proteins was achieved by incubation with isolated mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) in import buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 3% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm sorbitol, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm K-phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm MnCl2) supplemented with NADH (2 mm), ATP (2 mm), and an ATP regenerating system (creatine kinase (100 μg/ml) and phosphocreatine (10 mm)) at 25 °C. The membrane potential across the inner membrane was dissipated by addition of oligomycin (20 μm), antimycin A (20 μm), and valinomycin (1 μm). Non-imported precursor proteins were digested by trypsin treatment (100 μg/ml) for 20 min at 4 °C. After inactivation of the protease by adding a 20-fold molar excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor, mitochondria were further incubated at 37 °C in import buffer to examine the stability of imported polypeptides. Mitochondria were isolated by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. The integrity of mitochondria was routinely monitored by immunoblotting using antisera directed against various mitochondrial proteins. Stability of Newly Synthesized Mitochondrial Translation Products within Mitochondria—The in organello synthesis of mitochondrially encoded polypeptides and the assay for monitoring their stability was essentially performed as previously described (27Langer T. Pajic A. Wagner I. Neupert W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, to label in organello translated polypeptides, isolated mitochondria were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C at a concentration of 0.67 mg of protein/ml in translation buffer (0.6 m sorbitol, 150 mm KCl, 15 mm K2HPO4, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 12.7 mm MgSO4, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 1.13 mg/ml of α-ketoglutarate, 2.33 mg/ml of phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 μg/ml of each amino acid except methionine, 26.6 mg/ml of pyruvate kinase, pH 7.2) in the presence of [35S]methionine. After stopping incorporation of radioactivity into newly translated polypeptides by addition of cold methionine, mitochondria were isolated and washed three times with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, 0.6 m sorbitol, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm methionine, pH 7.2). To assess the stability of the newly synthesized polypeptides, mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in translation buffer and samples were further incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at various time points and immediately mixed with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 10% (w/v). Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble pellets were dissolved into LiDS sample buffer. Both trichloroacetic acid-insoluble and -soluble fractions were mixed with scintillation fluid (Ultima Gold; Canberra Packard) and the radioactivity was determined. Peptide Export from Mitochondria—After labeling of mitochondrially encoded polypeptides, mitochondrial pellets (200 μg) were washed three times with wash buffer and then carefully resuspended in 300 μl of translation buffer. To allow proteolysis of labeled polypeptides to occur, mitochondria were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After an incubation for 30 min, aliquots of 100 μl (containing 67 μg mitochondria) were immediately centrifuged (4 min, 13,200 × g) and supernatants (containing degradation products released from mitochondria) were recovered. To determine the total radioactivity, a small fraction (2 μl) of each sample was mixed with scintillation fluid (1 ml). The remaining sample was subjected to gel filtration on a Sephadex peptide column (7.5/300; Amersham Biosciences) that was equilibrated with 40% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions (300 μl) were collected and mixed with scintillation fluid (1 ml). The integrity of mitochondria was routinely monitored by immunoblotting using antisera directed against various mitochondrial proteins. Identification of Peptides Released from Mitochondria by Mass Spectrometry—Mitochondria were isolated from yeast cells grown on lactate medium by differential centrifugation and further purified by sucrose density centrifugation (26Diekert K. de Kroon A.I.P.M. Kispal G. Lill R. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 37-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Meisinger C. Sommer T. Pfanner N. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Released peptides were isolated by sizing chromatography and further analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described before (5Augustin S. Nolden M. Müller S. Hardt O. Arnold I. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2691-2699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). All assignments with a probability score larger than 30 and average mass deviations of fragment ions <0.25 Da were further analyzed. If more than one peptide of a given protein was identified probability scores between 16 and 30 were accepted. Each experiment was performed four times and proteins were only included in the data set if corresponding peptides were identified in at least two of four experiments. Antibody Production—For generation of a Mop112-specific polyclonal antiserum, the peptide C-SGVTDDMKQARRE corresponding to amino acid residues 931–943 of Mop112 was coupled with maleimide-activated carrier protein (Imject, Pierce) to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used for generation of antibodies in rabbits. Mop112 Is Localized in the Intermembrane Space of Mitochondria—The open reading frame YDR430c encodes a putative metallopeptidase with a predicted molecular mass of 112 kDa in yeast that has been localized to mitochondria in genome-wide studies (23Sickmann A. Reinders J. Wagner Y. Joppich C. Zahedi R. Meyer H.E. Schonfisch B. Perschil I. Chacinska A. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13207-13212Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 29Huh W.K. Falvo J.V. Gerke L.C. Carroll A.S. Howson R.W. Weissman J.S. O'Shea E.K. Nature. 2003; 425: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (3326) Google Scholar) and which we named Mop112 (for mitochondrial oligopeptidase 112 kDa). In agreement with a mitochondrial localization, amino acids 1–20 have the propensity to form an amphipathic helix, a characteristic of mitochondrial targeting sequences. To determine the submitochondrial localization of the protein, radiolabeled Mop112 was incubated with isolated mitochondria. Mop112 was imported into mitochondria in a membrane potential (ΔΨ) dependent manner and accumulated in a protease-protected location in the organelle (Fig. 1A). We did not observe proteolytic processing of Mop112 upon import into mitochondria. Osmotic disruption of the outer membrane made the newly imported protein accessible to proteinase K indicating a localization of Mop112 to the intermembrane space (Fig. 1A). The ΔΨ-dependent import of Mop112 is reminiscent of presequence-containing mitochondrial matrix and inner membrane proteins that require the TIM23 translocase for import (30Koehler C.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 309-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the import of Mop112 into mitochondria harboring a conditional allele of Tim23 (Tim23fs) (31Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). For control, the hybrid protein Su9-(1–69)-DHFR 1The abbreviation used is: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase. composed of the amino-terminal 69 amino acids of F1FO-ATPase subunit 9 of Neurospora crassa and mouse DHFR, was analyzed in parallel. Although import of Su9-(1–69)-DHFR in the matrix space was inhibited, Mop112 accumulated within mitochondria (Fig. 1B). We conclude that TIM23 translocase is not essential for the import of Mop112 into the intermembrane space. To substantiate the submitochondrial localization of Mop112 and exclude a mislocalization of the newly imported protein, we raised a polyclonal antiserum directed against Mop112. Sub-fractionation of mitochondria characterized Mop112 as a soluble protein of the intermembrane space: it became accessible to externally added proteinase K upon osmotic disruption of the outer membrane (Fig. 1A) and was recovered from the soluble fraction after an alkaline extraction of mitochondrial membranes (Fig. 1C). Mop112 Is Required for the Respiratory Growth of Yeast Cells at High Temperature—For a functional characterization, MOP112 was disrupted by homologous recombination. Yeast cells lacking Mop112 grew as wild type cells on glucose-containing media at various temperatures, whereas their growth was impaired under respiring conditions on non-fermentable carbon sources (Fig. 2). This growth defect was complemented by expressing Mop112 under the control of the endogenous promoter in these cells (Fig. 2A). Mop112 harbors two copies of a domain, which is composed of 185 amino acid residues and characteristic of the M16 pitrilysin family of metallopeptidases, and a consensus metal binding motif, HXXEH, at position 84–88, which represents the proteolytic center in many metallopeptidases (Fig. 2B). Whereas the histidine residues serve as binding ligands for the metal ion, the glutamate residue fulfils a catalytic function. We replaced both histidine residues by tyrosine and exchanged also glutamate 87 with glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant proteins were expressed in Δmop112 cells and examined for their ability to suppress the growth defect of Δmop112 cells on non-fermentable carbon sources. The growth of mop112H84Y, mop112E87Q, or mop112H88Y mutant cells on glycerol-containing media at high temperature was impaired as was growth of Δmop112 cells (Fig. 2A). Mutant and wild type proteins accumulated at similar levels in these cells as revealed by immunoblotting of cellular extracts with a Mop112-specific antiserum (Fig. 2C). Thus, the integrity of the consensus metal binding motif is essential for respiring growth at high temperatures, suggesting that Mop112 has metallopeptidase activity. The growth phenotype of Δmop112 cells is reminiscent of Δyme1 cells that lack the i-AAA protease acting on the intermembrane space side of the inner membrane (Fig. 2D) (32Thorsness P.E. White K.H. Fox T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5418-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To examine a potential functional relationship of Mop112 and the i-AAA protease, we deleted MOP112 in Δyme1 cells by homologous recombination and analyzed the growth of Δyme1Δmop112 mutant cells on glucose- and glycerol-containing media. Strikingly, deletion of MOP112 impaired both respiratory and fermentative growth of Δyme1 cells (Fig. 2D). This synthetic growth defect of mutations in MOP112 and YME1 points to a functional relationship of both proteins and therefore is in agreement with a proteolytic activity of Mop112 suggested by our mutational analysis. Notably, the requirement of Mop112 for efficient growth of Δyme1 cells appears to be rather specific as we did not observe any synthetic growth defect upon deletion of PRD1, encoding the oligopeptidase saccharolysin in the intermembrane space (21Garcia-Alvarez N. Teichert U. Wolf D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 33Büchler M. Tisljar U. Wolf D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), in Δyme1 cells (data not shown). Mop112 Is Not Essential for the Degradation of Mitochondrial Proteins—The i-AAA protease mediates the degradation of inner membrane proteins with large domains protruding into the intermembrane space. We therefore analyzed the stability of various non-assembled inner membrane proteins in Δmop112 mutant cells. Phb1 and Phb2, which constitute a large multisubunit complex in the inner membrane (34Steglich G. Neupert W. Langer T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3435-3442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Nijtmans L.G. de Jong L. Sanz M.A. Coates P.J. Berden J.A. Back J.W. Muijsers A.O. Van der Speck H. Grivell L.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2444-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), were synthesized in a cell-free system and imported post-translationally into isolated wild type, Δyme1, Δmop112, and Δyme1Δmop112 mitochondria (Fig. 3, A and B). Newly imported prohibitin subunits assemble only inefficiently with pre-existing subunits (36Tatsuta T. Model K. Langer T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 248-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and were therefore rapidly degraded when mitochondria were further incubated at 37 °C after completion of import (Fig. 3). Proteolysis was impaired in mitochondria lacking Yme1 demonstrating the involvement of the i-AAA protease in the degradation of non-assembled prohibitin subunits (Fig. 3). In contrast, deletion of MOP112 in wild type and Δyme1 cells did not stabilize newly imported Phb1 or Phb2 subunits (Fig. 3). We made similar observations in mitochondria lacking saccharolysin (data not shown). Moreover, proteolysis of Yta10-(1–161)-DHFRmut, another known substrate of the i-AAA protease (37Leonhard K. Stiegler A. Neupert W. Langer T. Nature. 1999; 398: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), was not affected in mitochondria lacking either Mop112 or saccharolysin (data not shown). We conclude that Mop112 is not essential for the degradation of misfolded polypeptides in mitochondria including substrates of the i-AAA protease. Mop112 Degrades Peptides Generated upon Proteolysis of Mitochondrial Translation Products—Whereas these experiments demonstrated the degradation of mitochondrial encoded proteins in the absence of Mop112, different degradation products may accumulate in Δmop112 mitochondria. The proteolytic breakdown of mitochondrial proteins results in the formation of free amino acid residues and a heterogeneous spectrum of peptides that are released from the organelle (5Augustin S. Nolden M. Müller S. Hardt O. Arnold I. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2691-2699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 17Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To examine whether Mop112 affects the stability of peptides within mitochondria, we analyzed the pool of peptides released from wild type and Δmop112 mitochondria upon proteolysis of non-assembled mitochondrial translation products. Mitochondrial encoded polypeptides were synthesized in the presence of [35S]methionine and subjected to proteolysis by further incubating mitochondria at 37 °C. In agreement with the experiments described before, non-assembled mitochondrial translation products were not stabilized in the absence of Mop112 (Fig. 4A). Rather, we observed a slightly increased accumulation of trichloroacetic acid-soluble degradation products in Δmop112 mitochondria (Fig. 4A). To analyze these proteolytic products, mitochondria were removed from the reaction prior to trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The supernatant fractions containing degradation products were collected and fractionated by gel filtration allowing separation of free amino acid residues (peak 3), peptides composed of up to six amino acids (peak 2), and those composed of more than six amino acids (peak 1). Strikingly, a significantly increased amount of large peptides was released from Δmop112 mitochondria when compared with wild type mitochondria (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, a similar amount of smaller peptides was detected in the supernatant fraction of both wild type and Δmop112 mitochondria (Fig. 4B). Deletion of OMA1 or YER078c, encoding metallopeptidases localized in the inner membrane or matrix space (24Käser M. Kambacheld M. Kisters-Woike B. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46414-46423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), 2M. Kambacheld and T. Langer, unpublished observations. respectively, did not significantly affect peptide release from mitochondria under these conditions (Fig. 4C). These experiments are consistent with oligopeptidase activity of Mop112 and suggest that Mop112 degrades peptides generated upon proteolysis of non-assembled mitochondrial translation products. The function of Mop112 might overlap with saccharolysin (or Prd1), which is also localized in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria. We therefore generated double mutant cells lacking both Mop112 and Prd1 and examined the release of peptides formed upon proteolysis of mitochondrial encoded polypeptides from these mitochondria. The deletion of PRD1 did not affect the growth of Δmop112 cells (data not shown). However, we observed a slight increase of large peptides released from Δprd1 mitochondria (Fig. 4C). Thus, both Prd1 and Mop112 appear to degrade peptides derived from mitochondrial translation products in the intermembrane space. Notably, peptides affected by Mop112 appear to be larger than those degraded by Prd1. Whereas deletion of PRD1 appeared to affect all fractions corresponding to peak 1 equally, large peptides within peak 1 accumulated preferentially in the absence of Mop112 (Fig. 4D). Mop112 Degrades Peptides Generated in the Matrix or Intermembrane Space—Released peptides derived from mitochondrial translation products are generated either by the i-AAA protease in the intermembrane space or by the m-AAA protease in the matrix space and subsequently transported by the ABC transporter Mdl1 across the inner membrane (17Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To examine whether Mop112 affects the stability of peptides generated in the intermembrane space upon proteolysis by the i-AAA protease, the export of peptides from the matrix was inhibited by deleting MDL1 in Δmop112 cells. Mitochondrial encoded polypeptides were synthesized in the presence of [35S]methionine in isolated mitochondria and the release of peptides upon proteolysis of the translation products was monitored as before. The amount of peptides composed of more than six amino acid residues increased significantly in the supernatant of Δmdl1Δmop112 mitochondria when compared with Δmdl1 mitochondria (Fig. 5A) demonstrating that Mop112 affects the stability of peptides generated by the i-AAA protease. Further experiments assessed the role of Mop112 for the stability of peptides generated upon proteolysis of mitochondrial encoded polypeptides by the m-AAA protease in the matrix space. Degradation of these substrates in the intermembrane space is inhibited in Δyme1 mitochondria lacking the i-AAA protease. After labeling of mitochondrial encoded proteins with [35S]methionine, wild type, Δyme1, and Δyme1Δmop112 mitochondria were incubated at 37 °C and the accumulation of proteolytic breakdown products in the supernatant fraction was analyzed. In agreement with previous findings (17Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), a reduced amount of peptides composed of more than six amino acids was set free from the Δyme1 mitochondria (Fig. 5B). Significantly more peptides were released from Δyme1 mitochondria lacking Mop112 (Fig. 5B). Deletion of PRD1 in Δyme1 cells resulted in a similar increase of large peptides in the mitochondrial supernatant, whereas their amount further increased in Δyme1 Δmop112 Δprd1 cells (Fig. 5B). We therefore conclude that both Mop112 and Prd1, although localized in the intermembrane space, affect the stability of at least some peptides generated upon proteolysis of mitochondrial translation products by the m-AAA protease in the matrix. Mop112 and Prd1 Affect Peptide Efflux from Mitochondria— To examine whether Mop112 and Prd1 are generally involved in peptide turnover within mitochondria, peptides released from wild type, Δmop112, Δprd1, and Δmop112Δprd1 mitochondria were purified and identified by mass spectrometry. In agreement with previous findings (5Augustin S. Nolden M. Müller S. Hardt O. Arnold I. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2691-2699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), a heterogeneous spectrum of peptides was detected in the supernatant of wild type mitochondria that are derived from a large variety of mitochondrial proteins. Whereas a similar number of peptides was identified when wild type, Δmop112 or Δprd1 mitochondria were analyzed, deletion of both MOP112 and PRD1 resulted in the accumulation of a significantly increased number of peptides in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 6A). The number of mitochondrial proteins, whose proteolysis has resulted in the formation of the released peptides, increased accordingly (Fig. 6B). The comparison of the peptide pools released from wild type and peptidase-deficient mitochondria allowed us to link the activity of Mop112 and Prd1 to the proteolysis of specific mitochondrial proteins. Peptides derived from 15 proteins localized in different mitochondrial subcompartments were only detected in peptidase-deficient mitochondria indicating the involvement of these peptidases in proteolysis (Table I). Peptides generated by the proteolytic breakdown of five additional proteins accumulated in significantly reduced amounts in wild type mitochondria (Table II). In agreement with an overlapping but non-identical substrate specificity of Mop112 and Prd1, the majority of these peptides accumulated exclusively in the supernatant of Δprd1Δmop112 mitochondria, whereas some peptides derived from these proteins were already detected when analyzing mitochondria lacking only Mop112 or Prd1 (Table II). We conclude from these experiments that Mop112 and Prd1, both localized in the intermembrane space, are involved in the complete degradation of a large number of mitochondrial proteins to amino acids and therefore broadly influence the peptide efflux from mitochondria.Table IPeptide sources identified only in mitochondria lacking oligopeptidases in the intermembrane spaceProteinSubmitochondrial locationΔprd1Δmop112Δprd1Δmop112Atp16MaM, matrix; IM, inner membrane; IMS, intermembrane space; n, non-mitochondrial (′).+Atp2M+Atp5M++Cox4M++Cox5aIM+Cox6M+Cox7IM+Cyb2IMS+Hem1M++Ilv5M++Mrpl32M+Pda1M+Qcr10IM+b+, identified peptides.++Rsm19M+Sdh2M+++Ymr002wn+a M, matrix; IM, inner membrane; IMS, intermembrane space; n, non-mitochondrial (′).b +, identified peptides.

Peptides derived from Gut2 were also released from Δprd1 mitochondria, but we did not detect any presequence-derived peptides in the supernatant of wild type mitochondria. These findings indicate that both oligopeptidases are involved in the turnover of mitochondrial targeting sequences that are cleaved off by specific processing peptidases in various subcompartments of the organelle.Table IIIPeptide sources of presequence-derived peptides released from Δprd1Δmop112 mitochondriaProteinSubmitochondrial locationTotalDifferentGut2IMaIM, inner membrane; IMS, intermembrane space; M, matrix.167Cyb2IMS104Mrpl32M75Yta10IM31Cox6M64Pdb1M21Atp2M11a IM, inner membrane; IMS, intermembrane space; M, matrix. Open table in a new tab Although the capability of the proteolytic system of mitochondria to degrade proteins to free amino acid residues has been recognized from early on, mammalian neurolysin and yeast saccharolysin remained for a long time the only known mitochondrial oligopeptidases. Here we began for the first time to analyze the role of oligopeptidases within mitochondria and describe Mop112 as a novel metallopeptidase of the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The observed synthetic growth defect of deletions of MOP112 and YME1 suggests a functional relationship of Mop112 with the ATP-dependent i-AAA protease. We did not observe a stabilization of various misfolded polypeptides, including known substrates of the i-AAA protease, in mitochondria lacking Mop112, suggesting that Mop112 is not an essential component of the quality control system in mitochondria. However, peptides generated upon proteolysis by ATP-dependent proteases are stabilized in the absence of Mop112 and can be detected in the mitochondrial supernatant. Its activity overlaps with saccharolysin (Prd1), which is also shown to act on proteolytic breakdown products of mitochondrial proteins. A careful analysis of the peptides stabilized in the absence of either peptidase, however, points to differences in their length dependences and suggests that longer peptides are preferentially degraded by Mop112. Together with our mutational analysis of the consensus metal binding motif of Mop112, these findings strongly argue that Mop112 acts as a metal-dependent oligopeptidase in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. We propose that the degradation of proteins in this compartment, similar to the proteolysis of cytosolic proteins, occurs by the sequential action of ATP-dependent proteases and oligopeptidases. The i-AAA protease degrades proteins residing in the intermembrane space to peptides that are further proteolyzed by at least two oligopeptidases present in this compartment. Evidence for the presence of yet another peptidase in the intermembrane space was provided by our analysis of the degradation of non-assembled prohibitin subunits. Although with significantly reduced kinetics, proteolysis occurred in mitochondria lacking the i-AAA protease and was not further decreased upon deletion of either MOP112 or PRD1. Mop112 and Prd1 do not only act on proteolytic breakdown products of intermembrane space proteins but also on peptides derived from matrix-localized proteins. We observed the increased release of peptides generated upon proteolysis of mitochondrial translation products by the m-AAA protease. This finding was confirmed by mass spectroscopic studies that led to the identification of peptides representing degradation products of matrix-localized proteins. A strongly increased number of peptides derived from matrix proteins were detected in the supernatant of mutant mitochondria lacking both Mop112 and saccharolysin. Thus, some peptides are exported from the matrix, presumably by the ABC transporter Mdl1 in the inner membrane, and degraded by oligopeptidases in the intermembrane space. This raises the possibility that the degradation of peptides to amino acid residues occurs exclusively in this mitochondrial compartment. However, we consider this hypothesis as highly unlikely for several reasons. First, peptides did not accumulate in the matrix space when peptide export from mitochondria is impaired (17Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Second, several putative oligopeptidases have been identified in the mitochondrial proteome and were localized to the matrix space (23Sickmann A. Reinders J. Wagner Y. Joppich C. Zahedi R. Meyer H.E. Schonfisch B. Perschil I. Chacinska A. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13207-13212Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar).2 A similar activity of at least some of these peptidases during proteolysis of matrix proteins is favorable. Therefore, parallel proteolytic pathways composed of ATP-dependent proteases and oligopeptidases degrading peptides to amino acids may exist in both the intermembrane and matrix space of mitochondria. Proteolytic products generated in the matrix space, being it peptides or free amino acid residues, can be extruded from the matrix for further degradation in the intermembrane space or release from mitochondria. Notably, such peptides also include presequences of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial preproteins that are cleaved off by specific processing peptidases present in various subcompartments (38Gakh O. Cavadini P. Isaya G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Peptides derived from mitochondrial targeting sequences were observed to be released from mitochondria lacking both Mop112 and Prd1 but not from wild type mitochondria. This finding assigns a function to both peptidases in the degradation of presequences within mitochondria and illustrates again their overlapping substrate specificities. Whereas our results reveal a role of Mop112 for the stability of peptides within mitochondria, it remains to be determined whether the growth defect associated with mop112 mutants reflects solely the loss of a general oligopeptidase activity. Although exerting an overlapping substrate specificity, deletion of PRD1 did not impair cell growth, nor did we observe a synthetic growth defect associated with mutations in PRD1 and YME1. Therefore, Mop112 is likely to exert specific functions within mitochondria. However, as both cells lacking Mop112 or Yme1 exhibit a similar growth defect on non-fermentable carbon sources at high temperature, we favor the hypothesis that the impaired respiratory competence of Δmop112 cells is caused by the impaired proteolysis of specific substrate protein(s) of both peptidases. Future studies will aim at the identification of these substrates to further characterize proteolytic functions of Mop112 within mitochondria.

In contrast to most PDZ domains, the PICK1 PDZ domain interacts with binding sequences classifiable as type I (terminating in (S/T)XΦ; X, any residue) as well as type II (ΦXΦ; Φ, any hydrophobic residue). To enable direct assessment of the affinity of the PICK1 PDZ domain for its binding partners we developed a purification scheme for PICK1 and a novel quantitative binding assay based on fluorescence polarization. Our results showed that the PICK1 PDZ domain binds the type II sequence presented by the human dopamine transporter (-WLKV) with an almost 15-fold and >100-fold higher affinity than the type I sequences presented by protein kinase Cα (-QSAV) and the β2-adrenergic receptor (-DSLL), respectively. Mutational analysis of Lys83 in the αB1 position of the PDZ domain suggested that this residue mimics the function of hydrophobic residues present in this position in regular type II PDZ domains. The PICK1 PDZ domain was moreover found to prefer small hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal P(0) position of the ligand. Molecular modeling predicted a rank order of (Val > Ile > Leu) that was verified experimentally with up to a ∼16-fold difference in binding affinity between a valine and a leucine in P(0). The results define the structural basis for the unusual binding pattern of the PICK1 PDZ domain by substantiating the critical role of the αB1 position (Lys83) and of discrete side chain differences in position P(0) of the ligands.

PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase 1) contains a single N-terminal PDZ domain and was originally identified as an interaction partner for protein kinase Cα (PKCα) (5Staudinger J. Zhou J. Burgess R. Elleedge S.J. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition to its N-terminal PDZ domain, PICK1 contains a coiled-coil domain (residue 145–165 in rat PICK1) that is believed to mediate dimerization of PICK1 (6Perez J.L. Khatri L. Chang C. Srivastava S. Osten P. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5417-5428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by a region bearing homology to Arfaptin 1 and 2 (residue 152–362), and a C-terminal acidic cluster (residue 381–389).Although PICK1 was named for its interaction with PKCα, it rapidly became clear that it had multiple interaction partners. At the current stage, the PDZ domain of PICK1 has been shown to mediate interaction with a broad range of proteins including receptor tyrosine kinases, ionotropic glutamate receptors of the l-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate subtypes, metabotropic glutamate receptors, ion channels, G protein-coupled receptors, aquaporins, transmembrane transporters, and ADP-ribosylation factors (see Table I and Ref. 7Beuming T.

PDZ domain interactions have been divided into three major classes; type I interactions in which the ligand terminates with (S/T)XΦ, type II interactions in which the ligand terminates with ΦXΦ (Φ is any hydrophobic residue), and type III interactions in which the ligand terminates with (D/E)XΦ (17Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 18Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett Jr., D.E. Li M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 336-342Google Scholar). For all three types of interactions, the side chain of the C-terminal residue (P(0)) fits tightly into a hydrophobic pocket in the domain lined by four conserved hydrophobic residues (19Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 20Bezprozvanny I. Maximov A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In type I interactions the hydroxyl group of the serine or threonine in the P(–2) position of the ligand forms a hydrogen bond with a highly conserved histidine in the αB1 position of the PDZ domain (19Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). In type II interactions the hydrophobic P(–2) residue interacts with a hydrophobic residue in the αB1 position in the PDZ domain (17Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar), whereas in type III interactions the negatively charged residue in P(–2) can hydrogen bond with a tyrosine in the αB1 position of the PDZ domain (18Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett Jr., D.E. Li M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 336-342Google Scholar, 21Tochio H. Zhang Q. Mandal P. Li M. Zhang M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).The PDZ domain of PICK1 does not seem to conform to this classification scheme, because it binds both classical type I ligands (e.g. PKCα and GluR52b) and type II ligands (e.g. GluR2 and dopamine transporter (DAT)), as well as ligands without a classical PDZ interaction sequence (e.g. ARF1 and -3) (Table I). Very few PDZ domains exhibit such mixed specificity, and the only three other PDZ domains that have been shown to bind class I and II sequences are the CIPP PDZ3 (22Kurschner C. Mermelstein P.G. Holden W.T. Surmeier D.J. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1998; 11: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the single PDZ domain of Erbin (23Borg J.P. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and the syntenin PDZ2 (24Kang B.S. Cooper D.R. Devedjiev Y. Derewenda U. Derewenda Z.S. Structure. 2003; 11: 845-853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A high-resolution structure has not yet been obtained for the PICK1 PDZ domain, but the similarities identified in structure-assisted alignment suggest that the structure of this domain should be similar to that of other known PDZ domains. A unique feature is that the αB1 residue, which is thought to be critical for determining the specificity of the PDZ interaction, is a lysine (Lys83) (20Bezprozvanny I. Maximov A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 509: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was recently shown that a specific mutation in the carboxylate-binding loop of the PICK1 PDZ domain results in loss of interaction with the type II binding sequence of the l-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluR2, whereas binding of the type I ligand PKCα appears unaffected (25Dev K.K. Nakanishi S. Henley J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41393-41397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This suggests different binding modes of type I versus type II ligands, but does not explain their structural basis.Here we have aimed to elucidate the determinants for the unusual binding pattern of the PICK1 PDZ domain, in the structural context of a molecular model of the protein. To this end we have developed a purification scheme for PICK1 and a quantitative binding assay based on fluorescence polarization (FP) that enables direct assessment of the affinity of the PICK1 PDZ domain for binding partners. Using this assay we show that the PICK1 PDZ domain has a more than 10-fold preference for the sequence presented by the human DAT (hDAT), which contains a prototypical type II binding sequence (-WLKV), over the type I sequence presented by PKCα (-QSAV). Second, we provide evidence using a series of combined amino acid substitutions in the PDZ domain and in the PDZ ligands, that Lys83 in the αB1 position of the PICK1 PDZ domain is playing an important role in determining this preference. Using both the computational modeling and experimental techniques, we elucidate the nature of the interaction of hydrophobic residues in the P(0) position, and their role in the binding specificity of the PICK1 PDZ domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Biology—The entire coding region of rat PICK1 (residues 2–416) was amplified from a pCINEO vector by PCR using pfu polymerase according to the instructions by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers used introduced a 5′ restriction site for MunI and 3′ restriction site for AvrII. The PCR fragment was cleaved with MunI and AvrII and cloned into the reading frame of the pET41a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) producing an N-terminal GST fusion of PICK1. The K83H and K83V point mutations were generated by two-step PCR using pfu polymerase. All constructs were confirmed by restriction enzyme mapping and sequenced. The pET41 PICK1 WT, K83H, and K83V vectors were transformed into the protease-deficient Escherichia coli strain BL21 DE3 (Novagen) carrying the pLysS plasmid.Purification Procedure for GST Fusion Proteins—Bacteria transformed with plasmids encoding the appropriate constructs were inoculated overnight in 50 ml of LB media, diluted into 1 liter of LB media, and grown to A600 1.0 (2–3 h). Expression of the fusion protein was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (500 μm) for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested and frozen at –80 °C until purification. The pellets were thawed and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 20 μg/ml DNase I, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and 1× bacterial protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The lysate was frozen at –80 °C and thawed and then thoroughly triturated to reduce viscosity. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (rotor SS-34, 18,000 rpm, 48,000 × g, 30 min). The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) under slow rotation for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted at 1,000 × g for 10 min and washed in buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol) by three batch washes. The protein was separated from the GST domain by cleavage with thrombin protease (Novagen) in buffer B. The protein was eluted on ice until use (usually the same day). Samples of 25 μl were taken from the protein solution for determination of protein concentration and SDS-PAGE. Protein determination was carried out using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's protocol using bovine serum albumin as standard. Gels were stained with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce) to inspect size, integrity, and purity of the protein.Peptide Synthesis and Design—Peptides were synthesized corresponding to the 13 C-terminal residues of the DAT, PKCα, and the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) as well as peptides carrying single point mutations in these sequences. Peptides of the wild-type (WT) sequences were labeled with Oregon Green 488 by adding N-terminal cysteine for coupling of the fluorophore. To this end the cysteine in the P-7 position of the β2AR sequence was changed to a serine. All peptides were purchased from Schafer-N, Copenhagen, Denmark, as 95% pure. They were purified by reverse phase high-pressure liquid chromatography and the identity was verified by mass spectrometry. Peptides were dissolved in buffer B and stored in aliquots at –20 °C until use.FP Plate Assay—Saturation binding isotherms for the PDZ-peptide interactions were determined by titrating a fixed amount of Oregon Green-labeled peptide (40 nm) with an increasing amount of PICK1 in a final volume of 100 μl. The experiments were carried out in black 96-well microtiter plates (Corning, New York) treated to reduce nonspecific adsorption of peptide and protein to the plate. The system was allowed to reach equilibrium (15 min) and changes in FP were read in a Chameleon FP plate reader (Hidex, Turku, Finland) in the FP mode using a 488-nm excitation filter and a 535-nm long pass emission filter. Each measurement is an average of 100 flashes and is carried out four times. FP was calculated according to the equation: FP = (IV – g × IH)/(IV + g × IH) and equilibrium saturation binding isotherms were constructed by plotting FP versus the concentration of PICK1. To determine Kd, a curve was fitted with the equation: Y = FPb × X/(Kd × X), where FPb is the maximal value of FP reached by complete saturation. Competition binding experiments were carried out in the same format as the saturation binding experiments using a fixed concentration of fluorescently labeled peptide (40 nm) and a fixed non-saturating concentration of purified PICK1, and an increasing concentration of unlabeled peptide. Equilibrium competition binding isotherms are constructed by plotting FP versus the concentration of unlabeled peptide. To determine Ki, a curve was fitted to the equation FP = FPf + ((FPf – FPb) × [Rt])/(Kd × (1 + X/Ki) + [Rt]), with FPf and FPb being the FP value of the free and bound peptide, [Rt] the concentration of PICK1, and Kd the apparent dissociation constant determined from parallel saturation experiments. Ki, FPb, and FPf were treated as free parameters. All equilibrium binding isotherms were repeated using at least three independent purifications (n = 3). The replicates were fitted separately using experimentally determined values for Kdapp and Rt, and average Ki values ± S.E. are given. Extrapolated data are indicated by italics in tables.Computational Analysis and Molecular Modeling—Models of the PICK1-peptide complexes were developed as follows: the PICK1 model was built using the MODELLER program (26Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar) based on the structures of the highly similar PDZ domains of InaD and syntrophyn (28% identity) in their peptide-bound forms, which served as templates. Loop regions were optimized with MODLOOP (27Fiser A. Sali A. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 2500-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar), and optimal side chain rotamers were found using SCWRL (28Canutescu A.A. Shelenkov A.A. Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2001-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Peptides were docked with a simulated annealing based approach that was shown to dock 5–8-amino acid long peptides to x-ray structures with root mean square deviation <2 Å, and to homology models with root mean square deviation <3 Å compared with the corresponding crystal structures. 2M. Y. Niv and H. Weinstein, manuscript in preparation. After docking, the structures of the peptide, the PDZ domain, and the complex were minimized for 300 steps, and the interaction energy (ΔEI) was calculated as the difference in non-bonded energy of the free peptide and the PDZ domain versus the non-bonded energy of the complex according to Equation 1. Ei=(Evdw+Ecoulomb)complex−[(Evdw+Ecoulomb)peptide+(Evdw+Ecoulomb)pdi](Eq. 1) Energies were calculated using the Charmm modeling package (29Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J.

Weinstein H. Proteins. 2003; 51: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We validated the affinity calculations for two test cases: the affinities of peptides for PSD-95-3 were determined using the crystal structure of the PSD-95-3/CRIPT complex (19Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) as a starting point, and the crystal structure of the NHERF-1-CFTR complex (33Karthikeyan S. Leung T. Birrane G. Webster G. Ladias J.A.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) was used to determine P(0) preference for NHERF-1. The calculations agreed with experimental data in both cases.RESULTSDual Specificity of PICK1 PDZ Domain—The PDZ domain of PICK1 is one of very few PDZ domains that can bind both type I and II sequences, and no obvious binding motifs are apparent in the reported ligands for PICK1 (Table I). Of 29 PICK1 PDZ interaction partners representing different binding sequences, 6 have a canonical type I PDZ binding sequence with a serine or threonine in the third to last position from the C terminus (P(–2)), whereas 12 have canonical type II PDZ sequences with a hydrophobic residue in the P(–2) position (Table I). Four additional interaction partners have hydrophobic P(–2) resi"

We found that transfection of the cells with a PKCδ kinase-dead mutant (K376R) or with a small interfering RNA targeting the PKCδ mRNA increased the apoptotic effect of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), whereas overexpression of PKCδ decreased it. PKCδ acted downstream of caspase 8 and upstream of cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. TRAIL induced cleavage of PKCδ within 2–3 h of treatment, which was abolished by caspase 3, 8, and 9 inhibitors. The cleavage of PKCδ was essential for its protective effect because overexpression of a caspase-resistant mutant (PKCδD327A) did not protect glioma cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis but rather increased it.

The enzyme is thought to consist of an adenylation domain, a catalytic cysteine domain, a four-helix bundle, and possibly, a ubiquitin-like domain.

The enzyme consumes ATP to attach ubiquitin to the active site cysteine residue of the enzyme in a labile thioester linkage, which allows the transfer of ubiquitin to various ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. All available data are consistent with a three-step mechanism for the reaction. In the first step, ATP is consumed to convert ubiquitin to ubiquitin adenylate, and pyrophosphate is produced as a byproduct. In the second step, the catalytic cysteine residue of the enzyme attacks the adenylate to form a thioester and AMP. In the third step, ubiquitin is transferred to the cysteine residue of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in a trans-thiolation reaction. Detailed kinetic studies have shown that ubiquitin activation proceeds by an ordered mechanism. ATP binding occurs first, followed by ubiquitin binding and finally adenylate formation. Formation of a new ubiquitin adenylate on the activating enzyme is thought to promote trans-thiolation of the thioester-linked ubiquitin to a conjugating enzyme (9Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A.

The first structurally characterized eukaryotic Ubl-E1 was the APPBP1·UBA3 complex, the NEDD8-E1, which was crystallized in the presence and absence of NEDD8 (10Walden H. Podgorski M.S. Huang D.T.

Very recently, the structure of Sae1/Sae2, which acts as SUMO-E1, has been published (14Lois L.M. Lima C.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Based on weak sequence similarity to these proteins, the structure of ubiquitin-E1 is thought to consist primarily of the adenylation domain and the catalytic cysteine domain, plus a ubiquitin-like domain at the C terminus of the protein (11Walden H. Podgorski M.S. Schulman B.A. Nature. 2003; 422: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 15Huang D.T. Walden H. Duda D. Schulman B.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1958-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Residues in ubiquitin-E1 that are equivalent to a short four-helix bundle domain in NEDD8 have been included in the adenylation domain (Fig. 1).Unlike the NEDD8- and SUMO-E1s, which are encoded on two separate polypeptide chains, ubiquitin-E1 is encoded by a single open reading frame with sequence similarity to ABBPB1 and Sae1 in its N-terminal part and to UBA3 and Sae2 in its C-terminal part (11Walden H. Podgorski M.S. Schulman B.A. Nature. 2003; 422: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 14Lois L.M. Lima C.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The domain organization is not readily apparent from the amino acid sequence, because the catalytic cysteine domain is discontinuous and interspersed into the adenylation domain. Here, the two parts of the catalytic cysteine domain will be referred to as the first catalytic cysteine half-domain (FCCH, Fig. 1, 2) and the second catalytic cysteine half-domain (SCCH, Fig. 1, 4 and 5), even though the two halves differ in molecular weight in both the ubiquitin-E1 and the homologues.Sequence conservation among Ubl-E1s is highest for the adenylation half-domains, which are also homologous to each other. Therefore, it is very likely that the adenylation domain of ubiquitin-E1 resembles the pseudodimeric adenylation domains of the NEDD8-E1 and SUMO-E1, and also the bacterial, dimeric MoeB protein (16Lake M.W. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nature. 2001; 414: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In contrast, no confident homology model can be built for the catalytic cysteine half-domains. Both half-domains differ significantly between E1s for different ubiquitin-like modifiers (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Domain organization mapped to linear sequence for the ubiquitin-E1 (top), SUMO-E1 (middle), and NEDD8-E1 (bottom). The adenylation half-domains are shown in dark and light gray, the FCCH in different shades of red, the SCCH in green and blue (representing the well conserved and poorly conserved parts, respectively), and the Ubl domain in very light gray. A, adenylation domain; CC, cysteine catalytic domain. The catalytic cysteine residue is marked by a yellow star. Color coding is consistent with that in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The FCCH consists of two antiparallel β-strands and a disordered region in SUMO-E1. It is larger (∼100 residues) in ubiquitin-E1 (∼100 residues) and largest in the NEDD8-E1 (∼230 residues), where this half-domain is almost entirely helical. The FCCH does not contain the catalytic cysteine residue, and its function in the various Ubl-activator proteins is not known (Fig. 2).The SCCH is built around a short core motif (∼80 residues), which is present in all Ubl-activator proteins and includes the active site catalytic cysteine residue. In NEDD8-E1, this core region represents the entire SCCH. In SUMO-activating enzyme, the SCCH is expanded by an ∼140-residue insertion, which exceeds the core region in size. An even larger, unrelated insertion is present in ubiquitin-E1. The function of the insertions in the SCCH is presently unclear.In this work, we present a biochemical characterization of the two catalytic cysteine half-domains and the crystal structure of the SCCH, and we propose a tentative model for the structure of ubiquitin-activating enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Expression, and Protein Purification—The clone for mouse ubiquitin-activating enzyme was a kind gift from Prof. H. Seino, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan. Standard PCR techniques were used to amplify fragments corresponding to residues 202–312 (FCCH construct), residues 626–891 (SCCH construct), and residues 1–439 (FH construct), according to Swiss Protein Data Base entry Q02053 numbering. These fragments were cloned via EcoRI and XhoI into pET15b(+) mod, which was created from pET15b(+) (Novagen) by a deletion of the original EcoRI site and by a modification of the multiple cloning site, which eliminated the thrombin cleavage site and placed an EcoRI site immediately downstream of a vector-encoded histidine tag. The amino acid sequence of all constructs was MGHHHHHHEF, which was directly followed by the sequence of the ubiquitin-E1 fragments. For protein expression, the plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells, which were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.7–1.0, shifted to 28 °C for 0.5 h, induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and harvested 4 h after induction. After affinity chromatography on nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose loaded with Ni2+ (Qiagen), the proteins were subjected to a gel filtration step in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA on Sephacryl S-200 HR (Amersham Biosciences) and concentrated by ultrafiltration.CD Measurements—CD measurements were performed with a Jasco J-810 spectrometer equipped with a thermostated cell holder using a 0.02-cm cell. Three scans at 20 °C between 250 and 190 nm were recorded and averaged. Spectra were corrected for buffer CD signal and normalized for protein concentration based on mean residue molecular weights: 109.07 for the FCCH, 108.89 for the FH, and 112.96 for SCCH. Spectra were analyzed with SELCON3, CDSSTR, and CONTIN of the CDPro software package (17Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2478) Google Scholar).Size Exclusion Chromatography—Gel filtration runs were performed at 24 °C using the Ettan LC fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column. The running buffer was 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl (buffer A), and the flow rate was 0.4 ml/min. Individual proteins and equimolar protein mixtures were prepared in a final volume of 120 μl, adjusted with buffer A, and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Vitamin B12 (molecular mass 1.35 kDa) myoglobin (17 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), bovine γ-globulin (158 kDa), and thyroglobulin (670 kDa) (all from Bio-Rad) were used for calibration.Crystallization—For crystallization, the SCCH was concentrated by ultrafiltration to 42 mg/ml and supplemented with 2 mm of the reducing agent tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride. Crystallization trials were set up at room temperature (21 °C) as sitting drop vapor diffusion experiments with 0.5 ml of reservoir buffer, by mixing 2 μl of reservoir buffer with 2 μl of protein solution. Crystals were obtained from a range of reservoir buffers, 0.075 m Tris, pH 8.3–8.7, 1.8–2.0 m ammonium sulfate, and 30–33% glycerol, and belonged to space groups H3 and H32. Choosing low ammonium sulfate concentration and a pH value at the extremes of the crystallization condition appeared to favor the growth of the H3 form, but sometimes both forms grew in the same drop. H32 crystals routinely appeared overnight, H3 crystals grew somewhat slower and were distinctly different morphologically. Both crystal forms could be flash-cryocooled in mother liquor.Structure Determination—In-house screening identified H32 crystals soaked with the tantalum bromide cluster as promising derivatives, and thus a three-wavelength MAD dataset was collected at the tantalum edge at BW6, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (absorption wavelength 1.2546 Å, inflection wavelength 1.2551 Å, remote wavelength 1.0500 Å; see Table I). Bijvoet differences that were measured at the peak and inflection wavelengths were strongly correlated up to a resolution of 5 Å (correlation >0.6 for the range 8.0–5.0 Å; correlation <0.3 for the range 4.7–3.3 Å), suggesting that it would not be possible to resolve individual tantalum sites. The SHELXD program (18Schneider T.A. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. 2002; D58: 1772-1779Crossref Scopus (1575) Google Scholar) identified three cluster sites (weights 1.0, 0.89, 0.80 for the correct sites, 0.18 for the first noise site). Phasing with the SHELXE program (19Sheldrick G.M. Zeitschrift für Kristallographie. 2002; 217: 644-650Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar) showed a clear preference for one hand (after 20 cycles, contrast 0.559 for the correct enantiomer versus 0.108 for the wrong enantiomer). The MLPHARE program (20Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) was then used for the calculation of an optimized electron density map. As the orientation of the clusters was not resolved, they were represented by single atoms in their centers with very high B-factors (refined to values between 150 and 250 Å2), and phasing was truncated at 4.5 Å (FOM 0.62 for the range 20.0–4.5 Å). The SIGMAA program (20Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) was then used to combine the MAD phases with the SIR phases that were obtained from the in-house Ta6Br14 data and a native dataset collected at BW6. After solvent flattening and histogram matching with DM (Density Modification) software (20Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) to improve the phases and extend them to higher resolution (FOM 0.51 for the range 20.0–2.8 Å), the resulting map was still of insufficient quality for manual model building but could be used to derive an averaging mask and approximate NCS symmetry. Refinement of the local symmetry operators with DM and cyclic 3-fold averaging then resulted in a map of sufficient quality (FOM 0.61 for the phases in the range 20.0–2.8 Å; average correlation between NCS regions 0.80) to manually build an approximate model from secondary structure templates. As the free R-factor was still very poor, the model was annealed with CNS (Crystallography and NMR System) software, with diffraction data in the resolution range 10.0–3.5 Å. The resulting model, with a free R-factor of 49.2% for this resolution range, turned out to be a very tight, noncrystallographic trimer. Thus, it appeared probable that the H3 crystal form could contain the same trimer. Indeed, MOLREP (molecular replacement) software (20Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) yielded clear signals in both the rotation and translation search prodedures, when the trimer was used as a search model. The values of the normalized rotation function were 11.05, 10.11, and 9.89 for three correct solutions, and 5.17 for the highest scoring incorrect solution. The translation function was also easily interpreted. The correlation was 47.8% for the best correct solution versus 31.3% for the highest-scoring incorrect solution. Multicrystal averaging with DMMULTI (Density Modification for Multiple Crystals) software (20Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19707) Google Scholar) yielded a much improved map (average correlation between NCS-related molecules, 0.92). This map (FOM 0.81 for phases in the range 20.0–2.8 Å) was of sufficient quality to allow confident tracing of nearly the complete protein. Throughout the trace, most of the side chains were visible, and the sequence could be assigned starting from the easily identified fragment WGDCVTWACHHW, with three characteristic tryptophan residues. Because of the slightly better diffraction and the availability of experimental phases, the H32 crystal form was chosen for further refinement, which was carried out with CNS software (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16930) Google Scholar) and NCS restraints with standard weights. The final model comprises 255 residues, with a gap of six residues in a disordered region (residues 815–820). Three bound tantalum bromide clusters that were used for phasing have been modeled as well. The orientations of these clusters could not be resolved and have been chosen arbitrarily in the final model.

We took advantage of the structural information to delineate the domain boundaries of mouse ubiquitin-E1 and expressed the two cysteine catalytic half-domains recombinantly in E. coli. As we were skeptical about the ability of the short FCCH to fold autonomously, we expressed this fragment both alone and as part of a larger fragment (residues 1–439) that comprised the first adenylation and catalytic cysteine half-domains. As this fragment represents roughly the first half of mouse ubiquitin-activating enzyme, it will be referred to as the FH fragment. All proteins were produced as fusion proteins with an N-terminal histidine tag and were purified in mg amounts by standard affinity chromatography techniques (see “Experimental Procedures”).The Two Cysteine Catalytic Half-domains Can Fold Autonomously—To assess the folding of the recombinantly expressed proteins, CD spectra were collected (Fig. 3). The CD spectrum for the FCCH indicated that the protein was ∼40% β-structure and contained either very little or no helix, in agreement with sequence-based secondary structure predictions but contrary to prior speculation about similar folds of FCCH and its counterpart in the NEDD8 activator. As β-proteins can be difficult to distinguish from unfolded proteins by circular dichroism, we next checked protein folding by NMR. The spectra indicate a slight tendency of the FCCH to aggregate, particularly in low salt, but peak dispersions were clearly incompatible with a fully unfolded protein (data not shown). In sizing chromatography, the FCCH migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 18.4 ± 4.7 kDa, slightly higher than the calculated mass of 13.2 kDa (Fig. 4A).Fig. 3Circular dichroism spectra of the FCCH (continuous line), the FH (dash-dotted line), and the SCCH (dotted line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4A, lack of comigration between the FCCH (dotted trace) and the SCCH (dashed trace).

C, calibration curve for molecular mass estimation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The FH was less prone to aggregation than the FCCH. This fragment (roughly equivalent to APPBP1 and Sae1) migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 59.4 ± 14.5 kDa, in acceptable agreement with the calculated molecular mass of 49.0 kDa (Fig. 4B). The helical features in its CD spectrum (∼25% helix, 25% β-sheet, 20% turn) are likely because of the helices in the first adenylation half-domain.The SCCH is predominantly helical (∼50% helix, 7% β-sheet, 15% turn). In sizing chromatography, the fragment migrated as a monomer, with an apparent molecular mass of 31.8 ± 7.7 kDa, in excellent agreement with the 31.2 kDa calculated mass (Fig. 4B).The Two Cysteine Catalytic Domains Do Not Comigrate— The possibility of producing folded cysteine catalytic half-domains suggested that the half-domains may act as independent units, rather than as building blocks for a tight complex. To distinguish between the two models, approximately equimolar amounts of the FCCH and the SCCH were injected either separately or together into a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column. No tendency for comigration was observed (Fig. 4A). As this negative result could have been due to partial folding or the slight aggregation of the FCCH, we replaced the FCCH with the larger FH, which was less prone to aggregation. As in the previous experiment, the two fragments did not appear to interact (Fig. 4B). We conclude that the association between the FCCH and the SCCH in ubiquitin-activating enzyme is primarily mediated by the covalent links to the adenylation domain, and only to a lesser extent, if at all, by direct noncovalent interactions between the two domains.Structure Determination—The FCCH did not crystallize, but crystals of the SCCH could be grown in two different space groups, H32 and H3. Both crystal forms contained three monomers in the asymmetric unit that were assembled into trimers in an essentially identical manner. As full-length ubiquitin-activating enzyme does not trimerize, the arrangement is likely a crystal packing effect and will therefore not be discussed further. The two crystal forms were solved by a combination of MAD methods and multicrystal averaging (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table I). The H32 crystal form was chosen for refinement, both because MAD phases were collected for this crystal form and because it diffracted to a slightly higher resolution than the H3 form. The final model for the H32 form comprises 257 residues in each of the three subunits in the asymmetric unit, plus three tantalum bromide clusters that were used for phasing and have no physiological meaning. Stereochemical and refinement parameters of the final model reflect the comparatively poor ordering of the molecules in the crystal (Table II).Structure of the Large, Second Catalytic Cysteine Half-domain—The crystal structure of the SCCH domain of mouse ubiquitin-E1 is presented in ribbon representation in Fig. 5A. In this orientation, the shape of the domain can be described as a distorted “U” with a large, central cleft in the middle. The cleft is bridged by a long and poorly structured region of the protein that lacks electron density for four residues altogether (Fig. 5A, pink). The topology of the SCCH is rather complex. Neither of the two “arms” of the “U” (subdomains) is built up from an uninterrupted stretch of amino acids. The rather complicated fold places the N- and C-terminal ends of the half-domain in close proximity. The active site cysteine (Fig. 5A, green ball) is located near the N terminus of the domain, just upstream of a very short helix. The location of cysteine residues at the N terminus of helices is thought to enhance their nucleophilicity, but in the present case, the helix is so short and irregular that any influence of the helix dipole moment appears questionable.Fig. 5Comparison of the structures of the SCCHs of ubiquitin-E1 (A), SUMO-E1 (B), and NEDD8-E1 (C).

Vampire bats, which sneak up on their prey along the ground, are an important exception. Here we show that common vampire bats can also run by using a unique bounding gait, in which the forelimbs instead of the hindlimbs are recruited for force production as the wings are much more powerful than the legs. This ability to run seems to have evolved independently within the bat lineage."

As for other chemokines, expression of CX3CL1 is known to be regulated at the level of transcription and translation. The unique transmembrane structure of CX3CL1 raises the possibility of additional functional regulation by altering its abundance at the cell surface. This could be accomplished in principle by changes in traffic between subcellular compartments. To analyze this possibility we examined the subcellular distribution of CX3CL1 in human ECV-304 cells stably expressing untagged or green fluorescent protein-tagged forms of the chemokine. CX3CL1 was present in two distinct compartments, diffusely on the plasma membrane and in a punctate juxtanuclear compartment. The latter shared some features with, yet was distinct from the conventional endocytic pathway and may represent a specialized recycling subcompartment. Accordingly, surface CX3CL1 was found to be in dynamic equilibrium with the juxtanuclear vesicular compartment. Intracellular CX3CL1 co-localized with the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide factor attachment protein receptor) proteins syntaxin-13 and VAMP-3. Cleavage of VAMP-3 by tetanus toxin or impairment of syntaxin-13 function by expression of a dominant-negative allele inhibited the ability of internalized CX3CL1 to traffic back to the plasma membrane. These data demonstrate the existence of a dynamic, SNARE-mediated recycling of CX3CL1 from the cell surface to and from an endomembrane storage compartment.

Inflammation is marked by the migration of circulating leukocytes into sites of injury. The inflammatory process involves a series of coordinated interactions between leukocytes and endothelial or epithelial cells. Central to this sequence of events are chemokines, a family of low molecular weight proteins that function as attractants of leukocytes bearing the complementary receptors. When engagement of chemokine receptors occurs, leukocytes become activated and are induced to adhere firmly to the inflamed endothelium. These initial steps culminate in diapedesis of the leukocyte across the endothelium and migration into the injured tissue (1Olson T. Ley K. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2002; 283: 7-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The local complement of chemokines elaborated by each organ is specific and varies with the type of inflammation present (1Olson T. Ley K. Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2002; 283: 7-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In addition, specific subsets of leukocytes bear distinct chemokine receptors. In this manner chemokines and their cognate receptors confer organ specificity to leukocyte migration and help to fine-tune the nature of the observed inflammatory response. One such chemokine, CX3CL1 (fractalkine) and its receptor, CX3CR1, have been shown to be of central importance in diverse inflammatory and infectious disease processes. Interrupting this pathway in vivo has a highly protective effect in animal models of renal inflammation (2Feng L. Chen S. Garcia G. Xia Y. Siani M. Botti P. Wilson C. Harrison J. Bacon K.

Unlike most other chemokines, CX3CL1 exists in two forms; as a soluble chemotactic polypeptide and as a transmembrane chemokine/mucin hybrid protein. In its soluble form, CX3CL1 acts as a chemoattractant for leukocytes bearing its unique receptor, CX3CR1 (7Bazan J. Bacon K. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D. Zlotnick A. Schall T.

In the membrane-bound form, the mucin stalk allows the chemokine domain of CX3CL1 to be efficiently presented to circulating leukocytes (9Fong A. Robinson L. Steeber D. Tedder T. Yoshie O. Imai T.

Membrane-associated CX3CL1 has been shown to mediate multiple steps of the leukocyte adhesion cascade, including capture of circulating leukocytes, either alone or in concert with other adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1 (9Fong A.

After the initial recruitment step, CX3CL1 interacts with CX3CR1 to further promote activation and firm the arrest of monocytes, NK cells, and CD8+ T lymphocytes (9Fong A. Robinson L. Steeber D. Tedder T. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Thus, CX3CL1 has dual roles as a chemoattractant and a cellular adhesion molecule. Like other chemokines, CX3CL1 biosynthesis is regulated at the transcriptional and translational levels (7Bazan J. Bacon K. Hardiman G. Wang W. Soo K. Rossi D. Greaves D. Zlotnick A. Schall T.

The objective of the present study was, therefore, to characterize the subcellular distribution of CX3CL1, its ability to translocate between cellular compartments, and the molecular determinants of this traffic. We found that CX3CL1 actively cycles between the plasma membrane and an internal, vesicular pool and also characterized the soluble N-ethylmaleimide factor attachment protein receptors (SNARE) 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide factor attachment protein receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; PAEC, primary porcine aortic endothelial cells; Ab, antibody; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; DN, dominant negative; TACE, tumor necrosis factor-converting enzyme. proteins involved in this process. The implications of these findings for the regulation of CX3CL1 function are discussed. Reagents and Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: goat polyclonal anti-CX3CL1 (R&D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), anti-CD63 (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), anti-GM130 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), Cy3-, peroxidase-, and Alexa 488-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and Fab fragment of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Rhodamine-conjugated transferrin and nigericin were obtained from Molecular Probes, and colchicine, brefeldin, and o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride were from Sigma. DNA expression constructs encoding GFP-tagged VAMP-3, VAMP-2, and syntaxin-13 as well as dominant negative-syntaxin-13 and mammalian tetanus toxin were generously provided by Dr. William S.

ECV-CX3CL1 cells were transiently transfected with DNA encoding the above GFP-tagged proteins using FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics), and transfected cells were analyzed 24 h later. In separate experiments ECV-CX3CL1 cells were transfected with EGFP alone or in combination with dominant negative-syntaxin-13 or tetanus toxin at a ratio of 1:10. Cell Culture—ECV-304 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and the generation of CX3CL1-expressing ECV-304 cells (ECV-CX3CL1) has been previously described (9Fong A. Robinson L. Steeber D. Tedder T. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding CX3CL1-GFP hybrid molecules was generated by PCR and subsequent ligation of the DNA fragments into pEGFP-N2 (BD Biosciences Clontech). DNA encoding the extracellular and transmembrane portions of CX3CL1 was synthesized using primers 5′-CGGGTCGACTCAGCCATGGCTCCGATA and 5′-CTGAGGATCCCCACGGGCACCAGGAC and digested with Sal1 and BamH1. These fragments were ligated together into the pEGFP-N2 expression vector digested with SalI and BamH1. The nucleotide sequence of both strands of the new construct (pCX3CL1-GFP) was determined to verify its identity. ECV-304 cells were grown in Medium 199 (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum and transfected by electroporation (Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad) and selected in 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). CX3CL1 expression was determined by flow cytometry. For some experiments ECV-CX3CL1-GFP cells were grown on glass coverslips and incubated at 37 °C with either colchicine (10 μm) or brefeldin A (100 μm) for 30 min. COS-7 fibroblast cells were obtained from ATCC and transiently transfected with pCX3CL1-GFP (COS-CX3CL1-GFP) using FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Primary porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAEC), a gift from Dr. Aleksander Hinek (The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario), were grown in M199 containing 10% fetal calf serum and transfected with the pCX3CL1-GFP construct by electroporation (PAEC-CX3CL1-GFP). Immunofluorescence Staining—ECV-CX3CL1 cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, and blocked with 5% donkey serum at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were incubated with anti-CX3CL1 antibody (Ab) (2.5 μg/ml) at room temperature for 1 h followed by Alexa 488-conjugated anti-goat IgG. After washing again, the cells were permeabilized using 0.1% Triton. Cells were incubated again with anti-CX3CL1 Ab, this time followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-goat IgG. In other experiments ECV-CX3CL1-GFP or SNARE-transfected ECV-CX3CL1 cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton. Cells were washed and labeled with anti-CX3CL1 Ab (1 μg/ml) followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-goat IgG. Immunofluorescence was examined using a Leica DMIRE2 microscope and OpenLab software (Improvision Inc., Lexington, MA). Co-localization was determined using OpenLab 4.0.2 co-localization software. The degree of co-localization was expressed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), as previously described (25Manders M. Verbeek F. Aten J. J. Microsc. (Oxf.). 1993; 169: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). In some experiments cells were examined by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 100× oil immersion objective and pinhole size 1.00 airy units (26Terebiznik M. Vieira O. Marcus S. Slade A. Yip C. Trimble W. Meyer T. Finlay B. Grinstein S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 766-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). For some experiments confocal images were deconvolved by importing the LSM file into Volocity 3.0.2 and applying the appropriate point spread function to 95% confidence limit. GFP was examined using conventional laser excitation lines and filter sets. Quantitation of CX3CL1 Using Peroxidase-coupled Ab Labeling—To quantify the fraction of CX3CL1 at the cell surface, cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates and fixed, and exposed epitopes were saturated by incubating with anti-CX3CL1 Ab (2.5 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h. To quantify the total amount of CX3CL1 within the cell, cells were fixed and permeabilized before incubation with anti-CX3CL1 Ab. Cells were incubated with a blocking solution of 5% donkey serum followed by secondary peroxidase-coupled anti-goat IgG at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were washed, and the reaction was developed using the peroxidase substrate, o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride. The optical density was read by spectrophotometry at 492 nm. Endocytosis Assays—ECV-CX3CL1, ECV-CX3CL1-GFP, COS-CX3CL1-GFP, or primary PAEC-CX3CL1-GFP cells were grown on glass coverslips and incubated with anti-CX3CL1 Ab at 37 or 4 °C for 1 h. Cells were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton. Cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-goat IgG, washed, and mounted on glass slides using DAKO fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA). In other experiments, after a 1-h serum-free period, ECV-CX3CL1-GFP cells were incubated with transferrin-rhodamine (30 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h before fixing and mounting. In some experiments, after cells were incubated with anti-CX3CL1 Ab for 1 h, membrane-associated Ab was removed by acid wash (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm glycine, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 2.5) on ice using published methods (27van Kerkhof P. Sachse M. Klumperman J. Strous G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3778-3784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to recover for various time periods, then washed, fixed, and incubated with Cy3-conjugated secondary Ab. Cell surface immunofluorescence intensity was measured using MetaMorph imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp., Westchester, PA). Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP)—Analysis of FRAP was performed as previously described (28Lippincott-Schwartz J. Presley J. Zaal K. Hirschberg K. Miller C. Ellenberg J. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 58: 261-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Reits E. Neefjes J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 145-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Briefly, ECV-CX3CL1-GFP or PAEC-CX3CL1-GFP cells were incubated in medium RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum and 25 mm HEPES (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C. Live cells were analyzed by confocal microscopy as described above using LP505 filter. A 30-milliwatt LASOS argon laser, set to 25% intensity, was used to irreversibly photobleach a region encompassing the entire CX3CL1-associated juxtanuclear compartment (≈5-μm diameter). For photobleaching, maximal pinhole size and 100% of set laser intensity were used, whereas 22% intensity was used for image acquisition. The dwell time per pixel was 1.60 μs. The recovery of fluorescence was measured serially over time at 45-s intervals. Control, non-bleached areas of the plasma membrane of the same cell were also serially monitored to quantify the amount of bleaching caused by repeated image acquisition. At the end of each experiment, cells were imaged to ensure that no significant structural or positional changes had occurred during the course of the experiment. Measurement of pH in the Intracellular CX3CL1 Compartment— ECV-CX3CL1 cells were grown on coverslips and incubated for 2 h with anti-CX3CL1 Ab at 37 °C. Cells were washed then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Fab-fragment of anti-goat IgG (20 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were placed in a Leiden chamber and mounted on the stage of a Leica IRE microscope for ratio determination of emitted fluorescence at 2 excitation wavelengths, 440 and 490 nm, as previously described (30Touret N. Furuya W. Forbes J. Gros P. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25548-25557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Excitation filters and image acquisition were controlled using a Lambda 10 filter-wheel controller (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) driven by the Metafluor software (Universal Imaging, Westchester, PA). A Dell Optiplex DGX 590 computer was interfaced with a Photometrics CCD camera via a 12-bit GPIB/IIA board (National Instruments, Foster City, CA). To generate standard calibration curves of fluorescence ratio versus pH, cells were perfused with a series of K+-rich solutions of known pH, each containing 5 μg/ml nigericin. The purpose of the initial studies was to examine the subcellular distribution and traffic of CX3CL1. Endogenous levels of CX3CL1 in primary cells are difficult to detect using currently available Ab. In light of this, we adopted another approach, namely expressing full-length CX3CL1 or GFP-tagged CX3CL1 in ECV-304 cells, a cell line with epithelial and endothelial characteristics (31Su T. Cariappa R. Stanley K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Haller C. Kiessling F. Kubler W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 353-361Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In a previous study cell surface levels of CX3CL1 on CX3CL1-expressing ECV-304 cells (ECV-CX3CL1) have been shown to approximate those of primary human vascular endothelial cells, minimizing the risk of mistargeting due to overexpression (9Fong A. Robinson L. Steeber D. Tedder T. Yoshie O. Imai T. Patel D. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1413-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). CX3CL1 Is Expressed in Dual Locations within the Cell— ECV-CX3CL1 cells were fixed and labeled with an Ab directed against the extracellular domain of CX3CL1. As expected, the Ab labeled only the surface of intact cells, as determined using both conventional epifluorescence (Fig. 1A) and confocal microscopy (Fig. 1C). To assess whether CX3CL1 is also present intracellularly, the same cells were then permeabilized and labeled again with anti-CX3CL1 Ab followed by incubation with a different secondary Ab. Permeabilization revealed a sizable intracellular pool of CX3CL1 with juxtanuclear location (epifluorescence microscopy, Fig. 1B; confocal microscopy, Fig. 1D). The relative magnitude of the surface and endomembrane compartments was quantified using a spectroscopic immunoperoxidase labeling method (see “Experimental Procedures”). The plasmalemmal component of CX3CL1 was found to account for 57 ± 6% of the total cellular pool of CX3CL1. The existence of CX3CL1 in at least two distinct cellular compartments was verified in cells expressing GFP-tagged CX3CL1 (ECV-CX3CL1-GFP). In this construct GFP is attached to the cytosolic tail of the transmembrane chemokine. The fact that the tagged construct (Fig. 1E) was recognized by the antibody directed to the extracellular domain anti-CX3CL1 Ab (Fig. 1F) confirms that the expressed protein traverses the membrane. The presence of GFP and antibody fluorescence at the surface and in the juxtanuclear endomembrane vesicles implies that the full-length transmembrane protein is found in both locations (Fig. 1, G and H). The similarity of this distribution to that of the untagged protein indicates that linkage to GFP did not visibly alter the cellular targeting of CX3CL1. We also used confocal microscopy to verify that GFP-tagged CX3CL1 is indeed expressed in dual locations. As shown in Fig. 1I, cross-sectional analysis confirmed that CX3CL1-GFP is expressed not only in the plasma membrane but also within a juxtanuclear compartment. The endomembrane compartment appears to be maintained in its juxtanuclear location by microtubules, since treatment with colchicine caused the intracellular CX3CL1-GFP to disperse (Fig. 1J). Interestingly, treatment with colchicine also caused an appreciable decrease in plasma membrane CX3CL1-GFP signal. These data raise the possibility that cell surface CX3CL1 is in dynamic exchange with the pool of intracellular CX3CL1 and that this exchange relies on intact microtubules. Identification of the Juxtanuclear CX3CL1-associated Compartment—The identity and function of the intracellular CX3CL1 compartment were investigated next. We initially assessed whether CX3CL1 was located in lysosomes, recycling endosomes, or the Golgi apparatus, all of which are maintained in a juxtanuclear position by retrograde transport along microtubules. ECV-CX3CL1-GFP cells were labeled with a late endosomal/lysosomal marker, anti-CD63 Ab (Fig. 2A). As expected, some degree of co-localization was detected in the juxtanuclear region. To obviate the possibility that overlap was fortuitous, due to the presence of multiple organelles in the same general region, cells were treated with colchicine before staining (Fig. 2B). Under these conditions no significant degree of association between CD63 and the CX3CL1-containing vesicles was observed (Fig. 2, B and C; Pearson's colocalization coefficient r = 0.317 ± 0.041; p > 0.1), demonstrating that the latter compartment does not correspond to late endosomes/lysosomes. To investigate whether the intracellular CX3CL1 compartment is associated with recycling endosomes, ECV-CX3CL1-GFP cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated transferrin for 1 h at 37 °C with (Fig. 2E) or without (Fig. 2D) colchicine treatment. As shown in Fig. 2D, transferrin was indeed internalized to a juxtanuclear location resembling that of CX3CL1. However, when the organelles were dispersed by microtubule disruption, only partial overlap was observed (Fig. 2, E and F), yielding Pearson's correlation coefficient slightly greater than 0.5, which is statistically significant (r = 0.515 ± 0.071; p < 0.05) and indicative of partial colocalization. Thus, the intracellular CX3CL1-containing compartment overlaps with but is not entirely identical to the transferrin receptor-containing recycling endosomes. In similar experiments CX3CL1-containing vesicles were found to be distinct from the Golgi stacks, identified using anti-GM130 Ab (Fig. 2, G–I). A dissociation between the two compartments was also noted when the cells were pretreated with brefeldin (Fig. 2H; r = 0.322 ± 0.068; p > 0.1), which is known to disperse the Golgi cisternae while compacting both recycling endosomes and the trans-Golgi network. A sizable fraction of CX3CL1 remained compacted near the nucleus, consistent with location in recycling endosomes and/or trans-Golgi network. Collectively, these data demonstrate that CX3CL1 is expressed within a specialized juxtanuclear compartment that is distinct from late endosomes/lysosomes and Golgi cisternae but which partially co-localizes with transferrin receptor-associated recycling endosomes. SNARE Proteins in the Intracellular CX3CL1 Compartment—To further characterize the intracellular CX3CL1 compartment and to investigate its possible relationship with the plasmalemmal pool, we proceeded to study molecular entities that might mediate fusion of CX3CL1-bearing vesicles with the plasma membrane. The SNARE family of proteins is thought to mediate the docking and fusion of vesicles with their target membranes, thereby facilitating the delivery of cargo between compartments. In an attempt to identify SNARE proteins, ECV-CX3CL1 cells were transiently transfected with DNA constructs encoding VAMP-2-GFP, VAMP-3-GFP, or syntaxin-13-GFP, which are known components of the endocytic and recycling pathway. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained with anti-CX3CL1 Ab to determine possible co-localization. As before, fortuitous overlap was minimized by pretreating the cells with colchicine. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the intracellular CX3CL1 compartment partially co-localized with syntaxin-13 (Fig. 3, A and B; r = 0.632 ± 0.032; p < 0.01) as well as with VAMP-3 (Fig. 3, C and D; r = 0.793 ± 0.009; p < 0.01). No significant co-localization with VAMP-2 was observed (Fig. 3, E and F; r = 0.395 ± 0.033; p > 0.1). These data support the notion that intracellular CX3CL1 represents a subcompartment of recycling endosomes and suggest that recycling may occur by SNARE-mediated fusion of endosomal and plasmalemmal membranes. Plasma Membrane CX3CL1 Undergoes Endocytosis in Diverse Cell Types—To ensure that the dual localization of CX3CL1 is not an idiosyncratic feature of ECV-304 cells, we transfected the tagged CX3CL1 in other cell types known to express the chemokine, namely primary porcine aortic endothelial cells and fibroblastic cells (COS-7). In both of these cell types, CX3CL1 was expressed with a distribution similar to that seen in ECV cells, namely, on the plasma membrane as well as in an intracellular location (see Fig. 4). The results from the preceding experiments suggested that intracellular CX3CL1 may represent a recycling endosomal pool. To verify this prediction, we incubated ECV-CX3CL1-GFP, COS-CX3CL1-GFP, and PAEC-CX3CL1-GFP cells with an Ab directed to the exofacial domain of CX3CL1 for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized before incubating with secondary Ab. In all three cell types tagged CX3CL1 was seen to accumulate in the juxtanuclear location in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 4, C, D, G, H, K, and L), providing evidence of dynamic exchange between compartments. Labeling of the juxtanuclear pool was prevented when the experiment was performed at 4 °C. In this instance only the superficial CX3CL1 was labeled (Fig. 4, A, B, E, F, I, and J), implying that endocytosis is required to deliver the antibody to the intracellular pool.

Here we use a variety of approaches to investigate the possibility that Elongator and Kti12 functionally overlap. Native Kti12 purified to virtual homogeneity under stringent conditions is a single polypeptide, but depletion of Kti12 from a yeast extract results in co-depletion of Elongator, indicating that these factors do interact.

Purified Kti12 does not affect Elongator histone acetyltransferase activity in vitro. However, a variety of genetic experiments comparing the effects of mutation in ELP3 and KTI12 alone and in combination with other transcription factor mutations clearly demonstrate a significant functional overlap between Elongator and Kti12 in vivo. Intriguingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that Kti12 is associated with chromatin throughout the genome, even in non-transcribed regions and in the absence of Elongator. Conversely, RNA-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that Kti12 only plays a minor role for Elongator association with active genes.

In competing for limited resources, microorganisms have evolved sophisticated strategies to gain selective advantage over their competitors. One of these is the secretion of toxic compounds that results in the killing or growth arrest of other species or genera. The yeast Kluyveromyces lactis secretes a toxin, referred to as zymocin, which inhibits the growth of various sensitive yeast genera, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1Stark M.J. Boyd A. Mileham A.J. Romanos M.A. Yeast. 1990; 6: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The native toxin is a heterotrimeric (αβγ) structure composed of three subunits, two of which are involved in facilitating toxin entry. Cytotoxicity resides solely within the γ subunit, and intracellular expression of this subunit alone in S. cerevisiae abrogates growth (2Butler A.R. Porter M. Stark M.J. Yeast. 1991; 7: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Genetic screening for mutations that confer resistance toward the intracellular expression of the zymocin γ subunit identified genes that were named TOT1–7 (toxin target) (3Jablonowski D. Frohloff F.

Interestingly, the initially isolated genes were found to encode subunits of either the yeast Elongator (Elp1/Tot1/Iki3, Elp2/Tot2, Elp3/Tot3, Elp4/Tot7, Elp5/Tot5/Iki1, and Elp6/Tot6) or the Kti12 protein (Tot4). ELP1/IKI3 and KTI12 were also isolated previously in independent screens for mutants that render cells resistant to the native toxin (Insensitive to Killer (IKI) and killer toxin-insensitive (KTI) genes, respectively) (2Butler A.R.

Interestingly, point mutations in Elp3, which abolish its HAT activity, also confer toxin resistance (5Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R.

Moreover, mutagenesis studies on the ELP3 gene identified mutations outside the HAT domain, which confer sensitivity to killer toxin, but not the phenotypes otherwise typical of elp strains (separation of function mutations) (3Jablonowski D.

This suggests that the requirement of Elongator for γ toxin sensitivity can be genetically dissociated from general Elongator function, perhaps through abolishing direct toxin-Elp3 interactions. The deletion of other HAT-encoding genes such as SAS3, HPA3, HAT1, and GCN5 does not confer zymocin resistance, further suggesting that Elp3, and not just any cellular HAT activity, is a target of the toxin (12Kitamoto H.K. Jablonowski D. Nagase J. Schaffrath R. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 268: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast to the deletion of ELP genes, which confers zymocin resistance, deletion of several genes encoding subunits of RNAPII transcription-related complexes renders cells toxin-hypersensitive (12Kitamoto H.K. Jablonowski D. Nagase J. Schaffrath R. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 268: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This is true for genes that encode subunits of the SAGA, the SWI/SNF, the Mediator, and the Ccr4-Not complexes. Zymocin hypersensitivity is also observed in cells carrying deletions of transcript elongation-related factors such as ctk1 (RNAPII C-terminal domain (CTD) kinase 1), fcp1 (CTD phosphatase), and rtf1 (Paf complex) or mutations in rpb2 (RNAPII). In contrast, histone deacetylase-defective cells display either wild type or even reduced zymocin sensitivity. Based on the latter finding, Kitamoto et al. suggested that situations favoring histone hyperacetylation might reduce the cellular requirement for the HAT activity of Elongator and thereby reduce zymocin toxicity (12Kitamoto H.K. Jablonowski D. Nagase J. Schaffrath R. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 268: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The above data suggest that the effect of the toxin is on RNAPII-dependent transcription. In apparent agreement with this idea, low resolution hybridization showed that global poly(A)+ mRNA levels generally decline in the presence of zymocin, and Northern blot analysis showed significantly reduced levels of specific RNAPII-generated transcripts (3Jablonowski D. Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Stark M.J. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In an attempt to further reinforce the notion that zymocin action is linked to RNAPII, Jablonowski and Schaffrath studied the effects on zymocin toxicity of genetic conditions that would be supposed to directly impair polymerase activity, such as mutations in the RNAPII kinase encoded by the BUR1/BUR2 genes, deletion of the SRB10 CTD kinase gene, and inactivation of the kinase activity of TFIIH (13Jablonowski D. Schaffrath R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26276-26280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In all cases, the mutant cells exhibited zymocin hypersensitivity. Moreover, hypersensitivity was also caused by truncation of the RNAPII CTD itself, further supporting the idea that a functional link between zymocin and RNAPII exists (13Jablonowski D. Schaffrath R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26276-26280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, KTI12 and the ELP genes were identified in a genetic screen using intracellular expression of the γ subunit as a means to look for targets of the toxin gene (TOT) (5Frohloff F. Fichtner L. Jablonowski D. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1993-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cells lacking the KTI12/TOT4 gene display temperature sensitivity and 6-azauracil sensitivity as well as hypersensitivity to Calcofluor White and caffeine (4Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Burkner K. Larsen M. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, kti12 cells have phenotypes that are similar to those observed for elp cells (4Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Burkner K. Larsen M. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M.G. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Low stringency co-immunoprecipitation experiments suggested the existence of an interaction between Kti12 and Elongator as well as one between Kti12 and the form of RNAP II phosphorylated at serine 5 of the CTD repeat (4Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Burkner K. Larsen M. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 14Frohloff F. Jablonowski D. Fichtner L. Schaffrath R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 956-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, deletion of KTI12 does not appear to affect the structural integrity of six-subunit Elongator complex (4Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Burkner K. Larsen M. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), making it unlikely that Kti12 is a structural component of Elongator. Interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments suggested that Kti12 occupies the promoter, but not the coding region, of the ADH1 gene (15Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Jablonowski D. Stark M.J. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We were intrigued by the data suggesting a functional connection between Kti12 and Elongator. Our previous data showed no evidence for Kti12 in highly purified Elongator fractions (11Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and the apparent overlap of elp and kti12 phenotypes might conceivably be misleading. Moreover, the immunoprecipitation experiments suggesting a Kti12-Elongator interaction were performed under non-stringent conditions that permit detection also of less meaningful protein-protein interactions. In this paper we set out to investigate in more detail the possibility that Elongator and Kti12 functionally overlap. Our data are consistent with the idea that Elongator and Kti12 interact in a manner that has important consequences for the function of Elongator as a histone acetyltransferase in vivo. Our data also suggest that Kti12 is a general chromatin component rather than a promoter-specific or even a gene-specific factor as proposed previously (15Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Jablonowski D. Stark M.J. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).

Methods. 2002; 26: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using the KpnI and BamHI sites to produce plasmid pKTI12-HISHA-304. After yeast transformation, a TRP+ clone was isolated in which the 3′-end of the KTI12 gene was replaced, resulting in expression of a Kti12-(His)10-HA fusion protein. Phenotypic analysis showed that the (His)10-HA epitope tag did not interfere with Kti12 function (data not shown). Similar procedures, but using tagging plasmids kindly supplied by Dr. Kim Nasmyth (18Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar), were used to produce and characterize Kti12–6HA and Kti12–18Myc strains (oligonucleotide sequences and other details are available on request). Protein Purification—The procedure for purification of Kti12 from a KTI12-HISHA strain has been described elsewhere (11Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Svejstrup J.Q. Tempst P. Methods. 2002; 26: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Gel filtration analysis was performed using a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a Biologic fast protein liquid chromatography system (Bio-Rad). The buffer used was 2% glycerol, 250 mm potassium acetate, pH 7.6, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1× protease inhibitors. The column was run at a flow rate of 30 μl/min, and the protein-containing fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Size markers (Amersham Biosciences) were dissolved in the same buffer and run immediately before and after each experimental sample for reference. Protein Identification—Gel-fractionated proteins were digested with trypsin and peptides analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectroscopy as previously described (17Winkler S.G. Lacomis L. Philip J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Svejstrup J.Q. Tempst P. Methods. 2002; 26: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Selected mass values from the MALDI-TOF experiments were taken to search the protein non-redundant data base (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD) using the PeptideSearch (19Mann M. Hojrup P. Roepstorff P. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1993; 22: 338-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) algorithm. Tandem mass spectrometry spectra were inspected for y″ ion series to compare with the computer-generated fragment ion series of the predicted tryptic peptides. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—500 μg of yeast whole cell extract in buffer A (40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and protein inhibitor mix) containing 250 or 500 mm potassium acetate, as indicated, was incubated for 2 h with Sepharose A beads, which had been previously conjugated with the 12CA5 antibody. After incubation, the beads were washed three times with the same buffer, re-suspended in 1× SDS loading buffer, and the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Expression of GST-Kti12 in Bacteria and Antibody Production—The Kti12 open reading frame was cloned in-frame with the GST protein in pGEX-3X and the fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 cells by induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h at 28 °C. Subsequently, cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline, and inclusion bodies were solubilized by sonication of the pellet in the presence of 0.5% sarcosyl. Solubilized GST-Kti12 was purified on glutathione-Sepharose per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant fusion protein was used to immunize rabbits (Imgenex). The resulting antibody was used for Western blots at 1:1000 final dilution in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween and 5% (w/v) milk powder. Killer Toxin Assays—To analyze killer toxin sensitivity, K. lactis cells expressing or not expressing the zymocin toxin were left to grow overnight on YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) medium (strains used are shown in Table I). The next day, ∼10,000 S. cerevisiae cells were dissolved in water and spotted in the vicinity of the growing K. lactis cells. The growth of the different mutants was compared with the characteristic eclipse growth of wild type S. cerevisiae cells. Other Assays—Histone acetyltransferase reactions (30 μl) were carried out as described (11Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol.

Purification of Native Yeast Kti12—Previous work by Schaffrath and co-workers reported evidence suggesting an Elongator-Kti12 interaction (4Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Burkner K. Larsen M. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, whether a small subset of Elongator complexes contained Kti12 as an integral, tightly associated subunit or whether Kti12 was merely weakly interacting with Elongator remained unclear. Moreover, the experiments suggesting the interaction were performed under very low stringency conditions (60 mm sodium acetate) (4Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Burkner K. Larsen M. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which might result in the detection of interactions that are not biologically significant. We tested the possibility that Kti12 and Elongator might exist in the same complex by isolating native yeast Kti12. The genomic KTI12 gene was modified so that the expressed Kti12 protein carried a C-terminal (His)10-HA tag. After genetic confirmation that the epitope tag did not interfere with Kti12 function (data not shown), the protein was purified by a mixture of conventional and affinity chromatography (Fig. 1A), as described previously (11Winkler G.S. Petrakis T.G. Ethelberg S. Tokunaga M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32743-32749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17Winkler S.G. Lacomis L. Philip J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Svejstrup J.Q. Tempst P. Methods. 2002; 26: 260-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows a Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of highly purified Kti12. The two polypeptides, of 40 and 180 kDa, respectively, were identified by mass spectrometry. As expected, the 40-kDa protein was Kti12. The 180-kDa polypeptide was identified as the product of the YDL223C gene. This protein is a frequent, irrelevant contaminant when this purification procedure is utilized (22Gilbert C.S. van den Bosch M. Green C.M. Vialard J.E. Grenon M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lowndes N.F. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 953-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Fellows J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12896-12899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A rabbit anti-Kti12 antibody, but not the corresponding rabbit pre-bleed, recognized the highly purified Kti12-HisHA protein isolated from yeast as well as the recombinant, bacterially expressed GST-Kti12 protein (Fig. 1C, anti-Kti12, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Using this antibody, we also found that the highly purified holo-Elongator complex did not contain Kti12 (Fig. 1C, anti-Ktil2, lane 1). Conversely, the highly purified yeast Kti12 did not contain Elongator, as indicated by the absence of Elp3 and Elp4 (Fig. 1D, lane 2). These data indicate that Kti12 is not a tightly associated, integral subunit of holo-Elongator complexes in general. Moreover, the finding that purification of Kti12 to virtual homogeneity did not uncover co-purifying proteins indicates that this protein is also not a stable component of other protein complexes. Elongator and Kti12 Interact in a Salt-labile Manner—The method used to purify holo-Elongator and Kti12 made it impossible to exclude the possibility that a weak, salt-labile interaction exists between these proteins. To investigate possible Kti12-Elongator interactions, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using extracts from cells expressing a version of the Kti12 protein that carried a 6× HA affinity tag. Fig. 2 shows the Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitations with 12CA5 (anti-HA) antibody using extracts from cells expressing untagged and tagged Kti12, respectively. In the control immunoprecipitation from untagged cells, none of the Elongator proteins were detected in the precipitates (Fig. 2A, lane 3), whereas 6× HA-tagged Kti12 effectively co-immunoprecipitated Elp3 and Elp4 under low salt conditions (Fig. 2, lane 6, 250 mm potassium acetate). Under more stringent conditions (Fig. 2, lane 8, 500 mm potassium acetate), there was significantly less Elongator associated with Kti12. However, both Elp3 and Kti12 were clearly co-depleted from the resin flow-through under both conditions (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 5 and 7 with lane 4), suggesting that Elongator and Kti12 do indeed interact but dissociate during the salt wash. Based on these observations, we now sought to purify the Kti12-HisHA protein under less stringent conditions (250 mm salt) (Fig. 3). In particular, as the majority of Kti12 elutes from Bio-Rex in 600 mm salt, this fraction was diluted to 250 mm prior to loading on 12CA5-conjugated Sepharose A beads (see Fig. 1A). After washing this column with buffer containing 250 mm potassium acetate, proteins were eluted and subjected immediately to nickel-agarose affinity chromatography. The resulting nickel-agarose elution profile was examined by Western blot analysis. Strikingly, Kti12 and Elp3 were now found to co-elute from the final nickel-agarose purification step (Fig. 3A). Unfortunately, because of the lower stringency of the purification procedure, other proteins contaminated the fraction; thus, to investigate whether Elp3 and Kti12 were in the same complex, the proteins in the 500 mm imidazole elution fraction were subjected to gel filtration chromatography. Fig. 3B shows a Western blot analysis of the sizing column elution profile. Although the resolution of this particular gel filtration experiment was not very good, several observations could be made. First, there was a good, but not precise, overlap of the elution profiles for Elp3 and Kti12 (Elongator peaks in fraction 16, whereas Kti12 peaks in fraction 18, Fig. 3B). Second, Kti12 eluted as a protein of much higher molecular mass than expected from its predicted size (37 kDa). The fraction in which Elongator peaked (Fig. 3B, fraction 18) also contained significant amounts of Kti12, consistent with the idea that under low stringency conditions Kti12 may associate with Elongator. Finally, the elution of “Elongator-free” Kti12 at molecular masses significantly above 37 kDa suggests that Kti12 either multimerizes or co-elutes with other proteins under those conditions. However, an alternative (and more likely) explanation is that a weak complex between Elongator and Kti12 is dissociating as a consequence of the dilution occurring during the course of the gel filtration experiment, resulting in their slight separation. Taken together, these data indicate that Kti12 associates with Elongator in a salt-labile manner. Genetic Interactions between Kti12 and Gcn5—The above results indicate that Elongator and Kti12 interact physically. Previous genetic characterization has shown that strains lacking KTI12 share number of general phenotypes with strains lacking ELP genes (4Fichtner L. Frohloff F. Burkner K. Larsen M. Breunig K.D. Schaffrath R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We set out to more precisely define the functional overlap between Elongator and Kti12 in vivo. We hypothesized that if Kti12 plays a role in the same cellular pathway as Elongator, then deletion of KTI12 should not result in any further deterioration in the growth of an elp3 strain. Indeed, cells lacking both ELP3 and KTI12 (elp3 kti12) displayed growth rates that were no worse than the kti12 and elp3 single mutants under a number of different conditions (Fig. 4A, and data not shown). We also surmised that if Kti12 is an important functional partner of Elongator in the cell, it should genetically interact with Gcn5, as Elongator does (16Wittschie"
https://openalex.org/W1491390158,"Our recent data demonstrate that activation of pmKATP channels polarizes the membrane of cardiomyocytes and reduces Na+/Ca2+ exchange-mediated Ca2+ overload. However, it is important that these findings be extended into contractile models of hypoxia/reoxygenation injury to further test the notion that pmKATP channel activation affords protection against contractile dysfunction and calcium overload. Single rat heart right ventricular myocytes were enzymatically isolated, and cell contractility and Ca2+ transients in field-stimulated myocytes were measured in a cellular model of metabolic inhibition and reoxygenation. Activation of pmKATP with P-1075 (5 microM) or inhibition of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger with KB-R7943 (5 microM)reduced reoxygenation-induced diastolic Ca2+ overload and improved the rate and magnitude of posthypoxic contractile recovery during the first few minutes of reoxygenation. Moreover,diastolic Ca2+ overload and posthypoxic contractile dysfunction were aggravated in ventricular myocytes either subjected to specific blockade of pmKATP with HMR1098 (20 microM) or expressing the dominant-negative pmKATP construct Kir6.2(AAA) in the presence of P-1075. Our results suggest that a common mechanism, involving resting membrane potential-modulated increases in diastolic [Ca2+]i, is responsible for the development of contractile dysfunction during reoxygenation following metabolic inhibition. This novel and highly plausible cellular mechanism for pmKATP-mediated cardioprotection may have direct clinical relevance as evidenced by the following findings: a hypokalemic polarizing cardioplegia solution supplemented with the pmKATP opener P-1075 improved Ca2+ homeostasis and recovery of function compared with hyperkalemic depolarizing St. Thomas' cardioplegia following contractile arrest in single ventricular myocytes and working rat hearts. We therefore propose that activation of pmKATP channels improves posthypoxic cardiac function via reductions in abnormal diastolic Ca2+ homeostasis mediated by reverse-mode Na+/Ca2+ exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2001473733,"The Na+/dicarboxylate co-transporter, NaDC-1, from the kidney and small intestine, transports three sodium ions together with one divalent anion substrate, such as succinate2-. A previous study (Pajor, A. M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 29961-29968), identified four amino acids, Ser-478, Ala-480, Ala-481, and Thr-482, near the extracellular end of transmembrane helix (TM) 9 that are likely to form part of the permeation pathway of the transporter. All four cysteine-substituted mutants were sensitive to inhibition by the membrane-impermeant reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) and protected by substrate. In the present study, we continued the cysteine scan through extracellular loop 5 and TM10, from Thr-483 to Val-528. Most cysteine substitutions were well tolerated, although cysteine mutations of some residues, particularly within the TM, produced proteins that were not expressed on the plasma membrane. Six residues in the extracellular loop (Thr-483, Thr-484, Leu-485, Leu-487, Ile-489, and Met-493) were sensitive to chemical labeling by MTSET, depending on the conformational state of the protein. Transport inhibition by MTSET could be prevented by substrate regardless of temperature, suggesting that the likely mechanism of substrate protection is steric hindrance rather than large-scale conformational changes associated with translocation. We conclude that extracellular loop 5 in NaDC-1 appears to have a functional role, and it is likely to be located in or near the substrate translocation pore in the protein. Conformational changes in the protein affect the accessibility of the residues in extracellular loop 5 and provide further evidence of large-scale changes in the structure of NaDC-1 during the transport cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2039925078,"Different ubiquitin modifications to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) signal distinct modes of lesion bypass in the RAD6 pathway of DNA damage tolerance. The modification of PCNA with monoubiquitin signals an error-prone bypass, whereas the extension of this modification into a Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chain promotes error-free bypass. Chain formation is catalyzed by the Mms2/Ubc13 conjugating enzyme variant/conjugating enzyme (UEV·E2) complex together with the Rad5 ubiquitin ligase. In vitro studies of this UEV·E2 complex have identified a ubiquitin binding site that is mainly localized on Mms2. However, the role of this site in DNA damage tolerance and the molecular features of the ubiquitin/Mms2 interaction are poorly understood. Here we identify two molecular determinants, the side chains of Mms2-Ile-57 and ubiquitin-Ile-44, that are required for chain assembly in vitro and error-free lesion bypass in vivo. Mutating either of these side chains to alanine elicits a severe 10–20-fold inhibition of chain synthesis that is caused by compromised binding of the acceptor ubiquitin to Mms2. These results suggest that the ubiquitin binding site of Mms2 is necessary for error-free lesion bypass in the RAD6 pathway and provide new insights into ubiquitin recognition by UEV proteins. Different ubiquitin modifications to proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) signal distinct modes of lesion bypass in the RAD6 pathway of DNA damage tolerance. The modification of PCNA with monoubiquitin signals an error-prone bypass, whereas the extension of this modification into a Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chain promotes error-free bypass. Chain formation is catalyzed by the Mms2/Ubc13 conjugating enzyme variant/conjugating enzyme (UEV·E2) complex together with the Rad5 ubiquitin ligase. In vitro studies of this UEV·E2 complex have identified a ubiquitin binding site that is mainly localized on Mms2. However, the role of this site in DNA damage tolerance and the molecular features of the ubiquitin/Mms2 interaction are poorly understood. Here we identify two molecular determinants, the side chains of Mms2-Ile-57 and ubiquitin-Ile-44, that are required for chain assembly in vitro and error-free lesion bypass in vivo. Mutating either of these side chains to alanine elicits a severe 10–20-fold inhibition of chain synthesis that is caused by compromised binding of the acceptor ubiquitin to Mms2. These results suggest that the ubiquitin binding site of Mms2 is necessary for error-free lesion bypass in the RAD6 pathway and provide new insights into ubiquitin recognition by UEV proteins.

The functions of Ub in cell cycle progression, induction of the inflammatory response, antigen presentation, protein trafficking, and other processes all rely on Ub conjugation to lysine residues of target proteins through the carboxyl group of Ub-Gly-76 (1Sun L. Chen Z.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M.

Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). This modification frequently results in degradation of the target protein by 26 S proteasomes (4Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), but ubiquitination can also lead to other functional outcomes (1Sun L. Chen Z.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M. Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 3Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Ub conjugation involves the sequential action of activating (E1), conjugating (E2), and ligase (E3) enzymes (2Pickart C.M. Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The E1 and E2 enzymes both form thiol ester adducts with Ub and both intermediates are strictly required for substrate ubiquitination. Most organisms possess a single E1, multiple E2s, and even more E3s. Individual E3s, many of which harbor a zinc-binding RING domain, act in conjunction with specific E2s to recognize individual substrate proteins thus imparting specificity in ubiquitination (2Pickart C.M. Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 5Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Substrates can be modified with one Ub, several single Ubs, or multiple Ubs in the form of an isopeptide-linked polyUb chain. These various modifications, especially mono-versus polyubiquitination, often lead to qualitatively different outcomes (2Pickart C.M. Cell. 2004; 116: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 3Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Further variation in Ub signaling can result from the use of different lysine residues in polyUb chain assembly (6Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). For example, Lys-48-linked chains signal targeting to proteasomes (7Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar, 8Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), whereas Lys-63-linked chains constitute a non-degradative signal in several pathways, including ribosomal protein synthesis (9Spence J. Gali R.R. Dittmar G. Sherman F. Karin M. Finley D. Cell. 2000; 102: 67-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), kinase activation (1Sun L. Chen Z.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and membrane protein trafficking (3Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 10Galan J.M. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5847-5854Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Mechanisms governing selectivity in the synthesis and recognition of these and other non-canonical polyUb signals are only beginning to be understood (6Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Besides the roles mentioned above, Lys-63-linked polyUb chains are required for a DNA damage tolerance pathway that has been most thoroughly characterized in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The components of the RAD6 pathway are highly conserved from yeast to humans (11Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Broomfield S. Hryciw T. Xiao W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 13Ulrich H.D.

Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar); their actions promote the bypass of DNA photo- or alkylation adducts that would otherwise block the progression of the replicative DNA polymerase. All events in this pathway depend on the Ub-conjugating activity of the Rad6·Rad18 (E2·E3) complex (14Prakash S. Sung P. Prakash L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 33-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 15Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23360-23365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), but the pathway subsequently divides into two branches. One branch, defined by MMS2, UBC13, and RAD5, mediates error-free bypass of DNA lesions (17Broomfield S. Chow B.L. Xiao W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5678-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 18Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M.

Genetics. 2000; 155: 1633-1641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly through the recruitment of an undamaged template strand (12Broomfield S. Hryciw T. Xiao W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 13Ulrich H.D. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The other subpathway, defined by REV3 and REV7, facilitates mutagenic bypass through use of the damaged strand as a template for a translesion polymerase (12Broomfield S. Hryciw T. Xiao W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 13Ulrich H.D. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Lys-63-linked polyUb chains signal selectively in the error-free branch of the RAD6 pathway (11Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 22Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.-L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified the essential DNA polymerase processivity factor PCNA as a major target of Ub modifications during DNA lesion bypass (22Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.-L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar, 23Stelter P. Ulrich H.D.

Biol. 2004; 24: 4267-4274Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Monoubiquitination of PCNA Lys-164, catalyzed by the Rad6·Rad18 complex, signals error-prone repair (22Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.-L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar, 23Stelter P. Ulrich H.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), probably by promoting the recruitment of a translesion polymerase (25Kannouche P.L. Wing J. Lehmann A.R. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 26Watanabe K. Tateishi S. Kawasuji M. Tsurimoto T. Inoue H. Yamaizumi M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3886-3896Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). This same Ub modification also serves as the substrate for extension of a Lys-63-linked polyUb chain, which promotes error-free lesion bypass (22Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.-L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). Chain formation requires a ternary complex composed of a RING E3, Rad5, and the heterodimeric Mms2·Ubc13 complex (18Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 19Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 22Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.-L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). Ubc13 is a canonical E2 enzyme, whereas Mms2 is one of a small family of UEV proteins, which resemble E2s but lack the defining E2 active site cysteine residue (27Sancho E. Vila M.R. Sanchez-Pulido L. Lozano J.J. Paciucci R. Nadal M. Fox M. Harvey C. Bercovich B. Loukili N. Ciechanover A. Lin S.L. Sanz F. Estivill X. Valencia A. Thomson T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 576-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The Mms2·Ubc13 complex functions as an E2 that is specialized for the assembly of Lys-63-linked polyUb chains (18Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 28Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the same lysine residue of PCNA that receives Ub modifications (Lys-164) is also a target for small ubiquitin-like modifier modification (22Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.-L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar, 23Stelter P. Ulrich H.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of sumoylation remain uncertain. It is not yet known how the individual biochemical reactions necessary for chain extension from monoubiquitinated PCNA (or other potential targets of Lys-63-polyubiquitination) are apportioned among the three proteins in the Rad5·Mms2·Ubc13 complex. The binary Mms2·Ubc13 complex synthesizes unanchored Lys-63-linked polyUb chains from free Ub in vitro (18Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 29Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (27936–27943): 27936-27943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Structure-activity studies and molecular modeling identified a likely binding site for the “acceptor” Ub on the Mms2·Ubc13 complex (30VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), where the acceptor Ub is defined as the molecule that donates Lys-63 to the nascent isopeptide bond. Recent solution structural studies carried out by Ellison and co-workers (31McKenna S. Spyracopoulos L. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40120-40126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 32McKenna S. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Spyracopoulos L. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13151-13158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have confirmed that Ub indeed binds to this site in a manner similar to that originally predicted. However, the finding that Rad5 is strictly required for PCNA polyubiquitination in vivo (22Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.-L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar) challenges the relevance of this site in PCNA polyubiquitination. Here we show that the side chains of Mms2-Ile-57 and Ub-Ile-44 are required for Ub binding to the acceptor site of the Mms2·Ubc13 complex, for chain assembly in vitro, and for DNA damage tolerance in vivo. These results strongly suggest that the acceptor Ub binding site is necessary for chain assembly in vivo. Yeast Strains—Parental yeast strains SUB62 (MATa lys2-801 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-1) and SUB280/SUB413 (MATa lys2-801 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-1[am] ubi1-Δ1::TRP1 ubi2-Δ2::ura3 ubi3-Δub-2 ubi4-Δ2::LEU2[pUb39][pUb100]) were provided by D. Finley. In the latter two strains, all four Ub-encoding genes have been deleted (11Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Ub is expressed from a LYS2-marked, high copy plasmid (pUb39), whereas a HIS3-marked (pUb100) plasmid expresses the essential ribosomal protein encoded by the UBI1 gene. In SUB280, pUb39 specifies wild type Ub; in SUB413, it specifies Ub-K63R (11Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both strains the plasmid-borne Ub gene is under the control of a CUP1 promoter. In the absence of copper (the condition used here) these genes afford approximately wild type levels of Ub (33Peng J. Schwartz D. Elias J.E. Thoreen C.C. Cheng D. Marsischky G. Roelofs J. Finley D.

Pickart C.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 950-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ub was purified as described (35Haldeman M.T. Xia G. Kasperek E.M. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10526-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Ubc13 was eluted from GSH beads by thrombin cleavage (30VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C.

Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Urea (4 m), glycerol (5% v/v), and NaCl (0.5 m) were added after cell lysis and DNA digestion and were maintained during nickel chelate chromatography. The eluted protein was concentrated and then renatured by successive dialysis against buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl) containing 1) 2 m, 2) 1 m, and 3) 0.5 m urea. The final dialysis employed buffer without urea or salt. Dithiothreitol, 1 mm, was included in the buffers beginning with the second (1 m urea) dialysis. H6-tagged mouse E1 was produced in insect cells and purified by nickel chelate chromatography (37Raasi S. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8951-8959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). C-terminally truncated (Ub74) versions of wild type and mutant Ubs were generated by treatment with trypsin, which cuts after Ub-Arg-74, followed by the addition of a 2-fold (w/w) excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) (38Wilkinson K.D. Audhya T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 266: 9235-9241Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Ub was radioiodinated (29Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol.

Yeast Extracts and Western Blotting—Cells (2 optical density units) from log-phase cultures of SUB413 (with or without the Ub-I44A-expressing plasmid) were pelleted, washed, and then sonicated in 90 μl of alkaline extraction buffer as previously described (40Knop M. Siegers K. Pereira G. Zachariae W. Winsor B. Nasmyth K. Schiebel E. Yeast. 1999; 15: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Aliquots were analyzed by Western blotting with affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against Ub (produced by these authors). Blots were developed colorimetrically by means of an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Assays—UV sensitivity was assayed in triplicate as previously described (18Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Chain assembly was assayed at pH 7.6 and 37 °C and monitored by SDS-PAGE (29Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol.

The standard steady-state assay (detection by Coomassie staining) contained 0.1 μm E1, 2 μm each Ubc13 and Mms2, and 117 μm Ub. To determine initial rates of Ub2 synthesis, Ub74 or Ub-Asp-77 (117 μm) was used as the acceptor in conjunction with full-length 125I-Ub (2–6 μm). Reactions were terminated during the linear phase of 125I-Ub2 synthesis, and this product was quantitated (following autoradiography) by band excision/counting or phosphorimage analysis (18Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In some cases enzyme concentrations were adjusted, and/or modified forms of Ub were used, as described in the figure legends. Published procedures were used to produce Lys-63-linked Ub4 carrying the K63R mutation in its distal Ub and an extra residue (Asp-77) in its proximal Ub (29Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (27936–27943): 27936-27943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar); this chain is chemically inert in the Mms2/Ubc13-catalyzed reaction. The integrity of the Mms2/Ubc13 interaction was assayed by monitoring the binding of untagged Ubc13 to H10-Mms2 immobilized on nickel beads as in our previous work (30VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M.

One of these sites (Fig. 1) interacts with the Ub molecule bound to the active site cysteine residue of Ubc13. We define this site, which is entirely located on Ubc13, as the “donor” site. The other site mainly encompasses a concave lower surface of Mms2 (as oriented in Fig. 1). This site binds the Ub that provides Lys-63 to the isopeptide bond. In the discussion below we refer to this as the “acceptor” site. We proposed the existence of donor and acceptor sites based on the results of modeling and site-specific mutagenesis (30VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The donor site is a universal feature of E2 enzymes (32McKenna S. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Spyracopoulos L. Ellison M.J. J. Biol.

Solution structural studies of Ellison and co-workers (32McKenna S. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Spyracopoulos L. Ellison M.J. J. Biol.

An Mms2-interacting Residue of the Acceptor Ub (Ile-44) Is Important for Chain Synthesis in Vitro and DNA Damage Tolerance in Vivo—Our goal in the present work was to test the involvement of the acceptor Ub site in the biochemical and biological activities of the Mms2·Ubc13 complex. To identify residues of Ub that are important for its binding to this site, we began with three residues that comprise a hydrophobic patch on the surface of Ub. The side chains of Leu-8, Ile-44, and Val-70 are important for the recognition of Lys-48-linked polyUb chains by proteasomes and for several other Ub-dependent processes (34Sloper-Mould K.E. Jemc J.

In addition, NMR results indicate that the surface encompassing these residues contacts the acceptor Ub binding site of the human Mms2·Ubc13 complex (31McKenna S. Spyracopoulos L. Moraes T. Pastushok L. Ptak C. Xiao W. Ellison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40120-40126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To test the functional significance of such contacts, each of the three residues was individually mutated to alanine, and the purified mutant proteins were screened in steady-state chain assembly assays with the yeast Mms2·Ubc13 complex. As shown in Fig. 2A, chain synthesis with the L8A and V70A mutants proceeded at a similar rate to the reaction with wild type Ub (lanes 7–14 versus 1–3; the anomalous migration of Ub-L8A seen in lanes 7–10 is frequently observed). In contrast, the Ub-I44A mutation caused a profound defect in chain synthesis (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6). Because the Ub-I44A mutation is lethal (34Sloper-Mould K.E. Jemc J. Pickart C.M. Hicke L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30483-30489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), we used an indirect approach to ask whether the in vitro defect conferred by this mutation correlated with a deficiency in error-free DNA lesion bypass. A plasmid specifying wild type Ub or Ub-I44A was transformed into a yeast strain engineered to express Ub-K63R as the sole form of Ub (11Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The parent strain, called SUB413, is UV light sensitive because of a specific defect in error-free lesion bypass that is due to the inability of Ub-K63R to be assembled into Lys-63-linked chains (Fig. 2B, open circles) (11Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). As expected, expression of wild type Ub from a control plasmid complemented this phenotype (filled circles). Note that Ub-K63R does not act as a dominant chain terminator, presumably due to rapid disassembly and re-synthesis of chains within cells (8Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of Ub-I44A in SUB413 failed to complement the UV light-sensitive phenotype of this strain (Fig. 2B, filled squares), despite robust expression as evidenced by increased levels of free and conjugated Ub (Fig. 2C). We postulate that the inability of Ub-I44A to promote DNA damage tolerance reflects the inability of this mutant to be used as a substrate for Mms2/Ubc13-catalyzed synthesis of Lys-63-linked chains (Fig. 2A).

Recent studies suggest that OREBP also plays a role in water reabsorption in the kidney, T-cell proliferation, and embryonic development. We developed transgenic mice that express the dominant-negative OREBP (OREBPdn) specifically in the lens because our earlier studies showed that it is particularly sensitive to osmotic stress. The transgenic mice developed nuclear cataract soon after birth, suggesting defects in lens development. The developing transgenic lenses showed incomplete elongation of fiber cells and formation of vacuoles. This is accompanied by evidence of DNA strand breaks, activation of p53, and induction of checkpoint kinase, suggesting that the developing fiber cells lacking OREBP are in a similar physiological state as cells experiencing hypertonic stress. These results indicate that OREBP-mediated accumulation of osmolytes is essential during elongation of the lens fiber cells.

Unlike other members in the NFAT family that are responsible for effective immune response, OREBP/TonEBP is primarily involved in the genetic program that is essential for cellular survival in response to hypertonic stress (3Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 215: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Through binding to the osmotic-response element (ORE) or the tonicity-responsive enhancer (TonE), OREBP/TonEBP mediates the hypertonic induction of a set of osmoprotective genes including aldose reductase, betaine/γ-aminobutyric acid transporter, and sodium-myo-inositol cotransporter, resulting in the cellular accumulation of sorbitol, betaine, and myo-inositol, respectively (4Ko B.C.

It is well established that these small molecule organic osmolytes are able to replace excess intracellular electrolytes that are otherwise deleterious to normal cell functions (7Burg M.B. Kwon E.D. Kultz D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This adaptive mechanism is particularly important in the kidney medulla, where cells are constantly exposed to steep osmotic gradient due to the urine concentration mechanism. Besides, OREBP is also responsible for the hypertonic induction of HSP70 (8Woo S.K. Lee S.D. Na K.Y. Park W.K. Kwon H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5753-5760Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), a molecular chaperone that plays a vital role in cellular adaptation to osmotic stress (9Shim E.H. Kim J.I. Bang E.S. Heo J.S. Lee J.S. Kim E.Y. Lee J.E. Park W.Y. Kim S.H. Kim H.S. Smithies O. Jang J.J. Jin D.I. Seo J.S. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). There are growing evidences suggesting that OREBP is involved in diverse cellular responses in addition to osmoprotection. In Drosophila, OREBP orthologue MESR1 was identified as a modifier of RAS1 signaling involved in eye development (10Huang A.M. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1219-1230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, OREBP was also implicated in cancer cell migration and cancer metastasis (11Jauliac S. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Shaw L.M. Brown L.F. Rao A. Toker A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In mouse embryo, OREBP is expressed in most developing tissues including brain, eye, heart, kidney, colon, and muscle. Since these developing organs are not expected to experience hypertonic stress, the physiological role of OREBP in these tissues remains elusive (12Maouyo D. Kim J.Y. Lee S.D. Wu Y. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F802-F809Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, OREBP homozygous knock-out mice manifested mid-embryonic lethality, indicating the important role of OREBP during development. A few OREBP null mutant mice that managed to survive through parturition displayed growth retardation and perinatal lethality associated with severe renal abnormalities (13Lopez-Rodriguez C. Antos C.L. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Lin F. Novobrantseva T.I. Bronson R.T. Igarashi P. Rao A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2392-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We have created transgenic (Tg) mice expressing a dominant-negative form of OREBP (OREBPdn) specifically in the collecting duct epithelial cells of the kidney and found that OREBP also plays an essential role in urine-concentrating mechanism by regulating the expression of aquaporin-2 and urea transporter genes (14Lam A.K. Ko B.C. Tam S. Morris R. Yang J.Y. Chung S.K. Chung S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48048-48054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, OREBP was also suggested to be vital for optimal T cell proliferation and function as Tg mice expressing OREBPdn in the T cells (15Trama J. Go W.Y. Ho S.N. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5477-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or thymus isolated from the OREBP heterozygous knock-out mice (16Go W.Y. Liu X. Roti M.A. Liu F. Ho S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10673-10678Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) exhibit a dramatic reduction in thymic cell proliferation and T cell-mediated antibody response. The apparent correlation between OREBP activity and cell proliferation revealed by the studies from the OREBPdn transgenic and OREBP null mice suggests that an intact cellular osmotic-response pathway is central to cell proliferation and function in some tissues. However, the underlining mechanism remains unclear. More importantly, the physiological function of OREBP in developing tissues other than kidney and lymphoid remains unexplored. We have previously shown that developing mouse lens is sensitive to osmotic imbalance (17Jiang Z. Chung S.K. Zhou C. Cammarata P.R. Chung S.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1467-1472PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we developed Tg mice that express OREBPdn specifically in the lens fiber cells to determine the role of OREBP in lens development. Our data demonstrate, for the first time in vivo, that inhibition of OREBP activity is associated with increase in DNA breaks and activation of DNA damage-response pathway, leading to defect in lens fiber cells elongation and the development of nuclear cataract. Our findings suggest that, during lens development, OREBP-mediated osmolyte accumulation is essential for fiber cell elongation and maintenance of the integrity of their DNA. Mice were housed under diurnal lighting condition and allowed free access to food and water. The protocol of this study was reviewed and approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research in The University of Hong Kong. Generation of OREBPdn Transgenic Mice—To develop Tg mice, the 390-bp fragment of mouse α A-crystallin promoter (from –341 to +49) (17Jiang Z. Chung S.K. Zhou C. Cammarata P.R. Chung S.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1467-1472PubMed Google Scholar) was fused to the human OREBPdn to direct expression of the transgene, specifically in the mouse lens. The FLAG epitope was added to the amino terminus of OREBPdn to facilitate detection of transgene expression. The DNA fragment containing the OREBPdn transgene was microinjected into mouse oocytes. Tg mice were identified by PCR analysis of DNA obtained by tail biopsy using a pair of PCR primers, pFLAG1 (5′-TAAGCTAGCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAG-3′) and Rp4 (5′-GGATATTGTCCACACAACATAGGGC-3′), and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization using the transgene as a probe. All Tg mice used in the experiments were heterozygous Tg mice that had been backcrossed with the C57BL/6J strain for four generations. Northern Blot—Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and dissected under the dissection microscope. Total RNA (15 μg/lane) extracted from the lens and other tissues of 4-week-old mice using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Centre, Inc.) was separated by agarose-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane. Hybridization was carried out using 32P-labeled OREBPdn and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA, respectively. Immunocytochemistry—For histological analysis, heads and whole eyes from embryos at different stages of development were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight prior to paraffin embedding. Seven-μm axial sections were prepared for immunocytochemistry. Rabbit polyclonal TonEBP antiserum (a kind gift from Dr. H. M. Kwon) was used for detection of the endogenous OREBP. Monoclonal anti-FLAG mouse IgG (Sigma, F4042) was applied for detection of transgenic expression. For detection of DNA damage checkpoint proteins, antiserum of p53 (FL-393, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-6243) and phospho-Chk2 (Thr-68, Cell Signaling, 2661) were used for immunocytochemistry staining (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). In all cases, the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse, or anti-rabbit) were used as secondary antibodies according to the instructions of the avidin:biotinylated enzyme complex kit and M.O.M. kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) followed by 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride substrate (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Hematoxylin was used as counter staining. Cataract Monitoring and Gross Morphology—Pupils of mice, starting from 2 weeks old, were dilated with 1% tropicamide (Alcon, Puurs, Belgium), and lenses were monitored with a slit-lamp microscope and photographed. Lenses were removed and photographed with a dissection microscope (Zeiss Axio Laboratories) fitted with ring light illumination. Mouse Eye and Lens Weight Measurements and Lens Water Content Calculation—Eyes from mouse embryos at different stages of development and postnatal mice were weighted. The wet weights of the lenses was determined, and then the lenses were dried at 100 °C for 24 h, and the dry weight was determined. The percentage of lens water content was calculated by: (wet weight – dry weight)*100/wet weight. Western Blot—For Western blot analysis, lenses from newborn mice were pooled and homogenized in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was dissolved in an SDS loading buffer. Aliquots containing equal amounts of proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against p53, FLAG, αB-crystallin (Stressgen, SPA-223), and β-actin (Sigma, A5441). TUNEL—A modified terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed to detect DNA strand breaks in situ on lens sections based on protocols described previously (18Marcon L. Boissonneault G. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 19Smith A. Haaf T. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. Sections were then preincubated inside a humidified chamber with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase buffer (Roche Diagnostics) for 30 min at 37 °C. The terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase buffer was discarded, replaced by fresh buffer (50 μl) containing 25 units of terminal transferase (Roche Diagnostics), 10 μl of 25 mm cacodylate buffer (supplied with the enzyme), 0.5 μl of 1 mm biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Diagnostics), and 5 μl of 1 mm dATP and then allowed to incubate for 60 min at 37 °C followed by washing the slides three times each for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline to terminate the reaction. The incorporated biotin-dUTP was detected by the avidin:biotinylated enzyme complex method (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) followed by DAB substrate (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and photographed. Expression of OREBP during Lens Development—There is no information regarding the temporal and spatial expression of OREBP in the developing lens, although immunostaining experiments showed that OREBP is present in the lens and the brain of the developing mouse embryo starting at embryonic day 10.5 (12Maouyo D. Kim J.Y. Lee S.D. Wu Y. Woo S.K. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F802-F809Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To investigate the expression pattern of OREBP during mouse lens development, we prepared paraffin sections of mouse lenses ranging from embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) to postnatal day 21 (P21). Immunocytochemical analysis of these sections revealed that OREBP was expressed in the epithelial cells from E11.5 to E16.5 (Fig. 1, A–C) but decreased significantly at E18.5 (Fig. 1, D–G). In addition, OREBP expression was localized to the primary fiber cells at E13.5 (Fig. 1B), and a higher level of expression was found at E16.5 (Fig. 1C). At E16.5, OREBP immunoreactivity was also detected in the elongating secondary fiber cells (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, OREBP expression was reduced in fiber cells at E18.5 (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, in postnatal lens, OREBP expression was further reduced and was limited to the secondary fiber cells near the equatorial region (Fig. 1, E–G). Generation of Transgenic Mice That Express OREBPdn Specifically in the Lens Fiber Cells—The highly specific temporal and spatial pattern of OREBP expression suggests that it may play a role in lens development. Since we and others have shown that mutant OREBPdn, lacking the transactivation domain, inhibits the function of endogenous OREBP (1Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Dahl S.C. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2538-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 14Lam A.K. Ko B.C. Tam S. Morris R. Yang J.Y. Chung S.K. Chung S.S. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2002; 169: 5477-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we examined the role of OREBP in the lens by generating Tg mice with the human OREBPdn cDNA (14Lam A.K. Ko B.C. Tam S. Morris R. Yang J.Y. Chung S.K. Chung S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48048-48054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) fused to the lens-specific α A-crystallin promoter that has been shown to direct the expression of heterologous genes specifically in the lens fiber cells (17Jiang Z. Chung S.K. Zhou C. Cammarata P.R. Chung S.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1467-1472PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lee A.Y. Chung S.K. Chung S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2780-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). A FLAG epitope was inserted at the amino terminus of the OREBPdn to facilitate the detection of transgene expression (Fig. 2A). The Tg mice were identified by PCR and confirmed by Southern blot hybridization (data not shown). Eleven lines of Tg mice were developed, and two lines were found to express detectable levels of the transgene (lines 4157 and 4165). Northern blot analysis showed that the level of transgene expression in line 4165 is ∼2-fold higher than that in line 4157. In both lines, the transgene expression was only present in the lens but not in other tissues tested, including the brain, lung, liver, and heart (Fig. 2B). Because both lines of mice exhibited similar nuclear cataract in the adult and abnormal embryonic lens morphology, we chose to characterize in detail line 4165, which has a higher level of transgene expression. Phenotypic Analysis of the Transgenic Mice—The Tg mice showed bilateral nuclear cataract 2 weeks after birth, the earliest time examined, suggesting developmental defect in their lenses. To determine the onset of such phenotype, we examined the expression of the transgene and the morphology of the lens in the early stages of development. FLAG immunoreactivity was not detected in the epithelial cells throughout lens development (Fig. 1, H–N). Transgene expression was detected in the lens primary fiber cells starting at E13.5 (Fig. 1I). The transgene became highly expressed at E16.5. At this stage, FLAG immunoreactivity was detected in the primary fiber cells, where the majority of the signal was found in the nucleus (Fig. 1J), as well as in the elongating secondary fiber cells, where the signal was in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The newly differentiated secondary fiber cells did not express the transgene (Fig. 1J). Expression of the transgene was associated with cellular deformities. At E16.5, numerous vacuoles were observed in the lens (Fig. 1J), and both primary and secondary fiber cells showed retarded elongation leading to an unfilled space in the anterior lens surrounding the primary fiber cell core. By E18.5, the transgene expression was markedly reduced and was localized only to the secondary fiber cells. Similar to the lenses at E16.5, numerous vacuoles were present (Fig. 1K). The level of transgene expression was significantly reduced in postnatal lens (Fig. 1, L and M). At P7, the transgene was only moderately expressed at the secondary fiber cells and restricted to the older elongating fiber cells (Fig. 1L). However, no vacuole or fiber cell defect was observed in all postnatal mouse lens sections. Interestingly, unlike the wild-type P7 lens in which the primary fiber cells were completely devoid of nucleus (Fig. 1E), the lenses of the age-matched Tg mice showed the presence of nucleus remnants in the fiber cells (Fig. 1L), suggesting a delay in the denucleation process. To determine the effect of OREBP inhibition on postnatal lens development, mouse lenses were examined by slit-lamp microscopy. All Tg mice demonstrated bilateral nuclear cataract starting at 2 weeks after birth and persisted for the rest of their lives (Fig. 3A). Flat angle illumination revealed indentations on the anterior lens surface of the Tg mice (Fig. 3B). To examine lens morphology in detail, lenses from 2-week-old mice were excised and observed directly under dissection microscope. In the wild-type lens, the secondary fiber cell endings were attached to the anterior pole to form Y-shaped suture branches oriented at 120° to one another and were not resolvable under dissecting microscope (Fig. 3, C and D) (21Kuszak J.R. Clark J.I. Copper K.E. Rae J.L. Jakobiec F.A. Albert D.M. Azar D.T. Gragoudas E.S. Power S.M. Robinson N.L. Principles and Practice of Ophthalmology. 2. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA2000: 1355-1408Google Scholar). However, sutures of the Tg lenses were clearly visible and abnormally expanded. In addition, opacity was observed at the endings of the suture branches (Fig. 3, C and D). The expanded suture and opacity disappeared at the age of 3 weeks, leaving a refractive anomaly that was revealed by the lateral view of the lens under dissection microscope (Fig. 3E). Since the suture is formed by the merger of fiber cell endings, the above observations suggest that OREBPdn expression leads to retarded fiber cell elongation, consistent with the observations in embryonic lens. Since defects in fiber cell development often result in microphthalmia, we measured the eye mass of the Tg mice. As shown in Fig. 4A, OREBPdn expression did not affect the growth of the mice since the body weights were similar between the Tg mice and their wild-type littermates as measured from weeks 1 to 8. However, eyes from the Tg mice were smaller than those from their wild-type littermates starting from week 1, and such difference persisted at least through 8 weeks (Fig. 4B). In addition, when the weight of the lenses from postnatal mice was determined, the lenses of the Tg mice were also found to be lighter than those of their wild-type littermates at all stages by ∼15% (p < 0.05). Similar mass differences were displayed in adult mice (Fig. 4C). Such difference was not due to the hydration status of the lens because the water content of the lens (∼67%) was similar in both Tg mice and wild-type littermates (Data not shown). Induction of DNA Breaks and Activation of DNA Damage-response Pathway in Tg Lens—It has been shown that hypertonic stress induces DNA double-strand breaks (22Kultz D. Chakravarty D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and decreases cell proliferation that is associated with cell cycle delay in the S and G2-M phase (23Michea L. Ferguson D.R. Peters E.M. Andrews P.M. Kirby M.R. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F209-F218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, acute elevation of osmolality with NaCl addition increases the total amount of p53 protein as well as in p53 phosphorylated on Ser-15 (24Dmitrieva N. Kultz D. Michea L. Ferraris J. Burg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18243-18247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether inhibition of the osmotic-response pathway by OREBPdn expression activates the p53 tumor suppressor pathway. Substantial increase in p53 protein level in the lenses of the newborn Tg mice was revealed by Western blotting, whereas the expression of α-B crystalline, which can be induced by hypertonicity (25Lin L.R. Carper D. Yokoyama T. Reddy V.N. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 2352-2359PubMed Google Scholar), was not affected (Fig. 5). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that p53 overexpression began at E16.5 when Tg expression is maximal (Fig. 6, A and B) and localized to both the primary and the secondary fiber cells of the Tg mice, suggesting that p53 expression is associated with OREBPdn expression (compare Fig. 6B and Fig. 1J). Furthermore, phosphorylated checkpoint kinase 2 (p-Chk2), the upstream kinase for the activation of p53, was also abundantly expressed in the fiber cells of the Tg mice (Fig. 6, C and D). Since DNA damage is one of the major mechanisms leading to Chk2 and p53 activation, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (26Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2554) Google Scholar), we examined apoptosis in the lens of the Tg mice. Using the conventional TUNEL assay, we failed to detect apoptotic fiber cells from E13.5 to E18.5 (data not shown). Nevertheless, when a modified TUNEL assay that is more sensitive in detecting DNA strand breaks was used (18Marcon L. Boissonneault G. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 910-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 19Smith A. Haaf T. BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we observed a remarkable increase in the incorporation of dUTP into the 3′-OH ends of DNA in the fiber cells of the Tg mice, suggesting extensive DNA breaks in OREBPdn-expressing lens (Fig. 6, E and F). Taken together, these data suggest that OREBPdn expression results in DNA damage, leading to the activation of p53-response pathway.Fig. 6Expression of p53 (A and B) and p-Chk2 (C and D) proteins by immunocytochemistry, and detection of DNA breaks by TUNEL assays (E and F) of E16.5 lens sections.

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ocular lens provides a unique system to study cell growth and differentiation because it contains only two types of cells, a core of fiber cells under an anterior monolayer of proliferative cuboidal epithelial stem cells. Distinct from many other cell types, the lens fiber cells are post-mitotic and terminally differentiated, yet these cells are directed to undergo significant elongation to complete lens development. We showed that OREBP is expressed in the epithelial and primary fiber cells during early lens development (E13.5). At this stage, the primary fiber cells are differentiating and elongating to fill the cavity of the spherical lens vesicle. OREBP expression was also found to be associated with the elongating secondary fiber cells at a later stage of embryonic development (E16.5 and E18.5) but reduced dramatically in postnatal lens. These data suggest that OREBP may play a role in lens development. The OREBPdn Tg mice showed nuclear cataract before weaning. This is likely the result of impaired lens development. At the embryonic stage, the lenses of the Tg mice show numerous vacuoles, disorganized fiber cells, and incomplete elongation of fiber cells. Vacuoles are a common feature in many cataract models. The cause of vacuole formation is not clear. It is most likely due to degenerating fiber cells. Interestingly, the vacuoles in the fiber cells disappeared in the adult lenses, probably as a result of cell compaction during lens maturation. However, the damage to the primary fiber cells probably leads to disorganization of the crystallin structure and nuclear cataract. Since OREBPdn was only expressed in the fiber cells that were terminally differentiated, our findings mainly define the role of OREBP in cell growth and elongation. Elongation of fiber cells is an essential step in lens development. It is initiated by intracellular potassium accumulation, leading to osmotic water influx and the increase in cell volume (27Parmelee J.T. Beebe D.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The failure of the fiber cells to complete their elongation process provides a clue to the function of OREBP. Perhaps OREBP, activated by developmental program rather than hypertonic environment, mediates rapid accumulation of osmolytes to build up intracellular osmotic pressure to facilitate water influx. On the other hand, it has been suggested that during the induction of cell growth, the massive synthesis of macromolecules and the concomitant depletion of amino acids would effectively decrease intracellular osmotic pressure, imposing osmotic stress to cells analogous to that of exposure of cells to hypertonicity (28Ho S.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fiber cells differentiation, in particular, is marked by a dramatic accumulation of lens crystallin proteins (28Ho S.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 413: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29O'Neill W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C995-C1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that OREBP is required to orchestrate the increase in osmolyte accumulation not only to fill in the void created by amino acid depletion but also to increase osmotic pressure for cell elongation. Unfortunately, determining the intracellular osmotic pressure or the levels of various osmolytes in the elongating fiber cells in the embryonic lenses is technically difficult. One indication that the elongating lens fiber cells from the OREBPdn Tg mouse are experiencing hypertonic stress is the observation that they have increased DNA strand breaks similar to those observed in cells under hypertonic stress. It has been shown that exposure of kidney cells to acute hypertonic stress (600 mosm) causes DNA double-strand breaks (22Kultz D. Chakravarty D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and widespread DNA strand breaks were also detected in the kidney inner medulla in vivo (30Dmitrieva N.I. Cai Q. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This is concomitant with the induction of p53 and cell cycle delay (24Dmitrieva N. Kultz D. Michea L. Ferraris J. Burg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18243-18247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 31Kishi H. Nakagawa K. Matsumoto M. Suga M. Ando M. Taya Y. Yamaizumi M.

Physiol. 2001; 130: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In lens fiber cells of the OREBPdn Tg mice, DNA damage was accompanied by the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway, as evidenced by the phosphorylation of Chk2. This is different from cells under hypertonic stress in which DNA damage response, as marked by chk phosphorylation, is compromised (30Dmitrieva N.I. Cai Q. Burg M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2317-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In proliferating cells, the Chk2 protein plays an important role in organizing the DNA damage response including stabilization of p53 and phosphorylation of Cdc 25A and Cdc25C proteins, resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1/S or G2/M or apoptosis (33Ahn J. Urist M. Prives C. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 34Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). However, the expression of p53 in terminally differentiated fiber cells and the absence of apoptosis in the Tg lens argue against the role of p53 in cell cycle control of these cells. It is likely that the activation of DNA damage-response pathway may also account for the lymphoid hypocellularity in the OREBP knock-out mice (16Go W.Y. Liu X. Roti M.A. Liu F. Ho S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10673-10678Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), as well as the development of hydronephrosis in the transgenic mice that express OREBPdn in the kidney collecting duct epithelial cells (14Lam A.K. Ko B.C. Tam S. Morris R. Yang J.Y. Chung S.K. Chung S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48048-48054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the lens of the adult mice, p53 immunoreactivity was found in the epithelial cells of the central and pre-equatorial zones, as well as in the lens fiber cells at the bow region (35Pokroy R. Tendler Y. Pollack A. Zinder O. Weisinger G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1736-1741PubMed Google Scholar). However, the physiological function of p53 in these cells has not been determined. Interestingly, transgenic mice overexpressing wild-type p53 developed microphthalmia associated with fiber cell malformation and nuclear cataract (36Nakamura T. Pichel J.G. Williams-Simons L. Westphal H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6142-6146Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Likewise, our transgenic mice also overexpressed p53 and developed similar, albeit less severe, microphthalmia, fiber cell defects, and nuclear cataracts. The similarity between these two mouse models suggests that p53 induction may play a prominent role in the phenotype of our Tg mice. Apparently, the activation of p53 also delays the denucleation program of lens fiber cells, as suggested by the presence of nuclear remnant in the lenses of the Tg mice. However, the role of p53 leading to these abnormalities in the lenses of these Tg mice is not clear. In summary, our study demonstrates that OREBP is important for fiber cell growth and elongation and reveals a possible mechanism linking a defective osmotic-response pathway to DNA integrity and cell growth.

Here we report a novel gene, mimitin (Myc-induced mitochondrial protein), that encodes a mitochondrial protein with a molecular mass of 20 kDa. We demonstrated that the transcription of mimitin is directly stimulated by c-Myc. To investigate the role of Mimitin, its expression was suppressed by the RNA interference (RNAi) technique. Whereas specific inhibition of mimitin expression did not affect cell proliferation in human cervical carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, and hepatocarcinoma cell lines, it did suppress cell proliferation in human glioblastoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and embryonic lung fibroblastic cells, with the greatest suppression efficiency in ESCC cells. To investigate whether mimitin is related to tumorigenesis in ESCC in vivo, the expression of Mimitin protein in ESCC tissues was studied. Mimitin was highly expressed in 80% (28 of 35) of ESCC tumors, suggesting that high expression of Mimitin is a characteristic feature of ESCC. The expression level of Mimitin was found to be correlated with that of c-Myc and cell proliferation, but not with the histopathological grade, stage of cancer, or age of patients. Taken together, these results suggest that the novel gene mimitin is a direct transcriptional target of c-Myc, and is involved in Myc-dependent cell proliferation at least in ESCC cells.

The myc family of proto-oncogenes consists of three main genes: c-myc, N-myc, and L-myc (1DePinho R.A. Schreiber-Agus N. Alt F.W. Adv.

Deregulated expression of myc family genes through gene amplification, viral promoter insertion, chromosomal translocation, or promoter mutation has long been known to be associated with neoplastic diseases in a wide range of vertebrates including humans. Embryonic mice with c-myc or N-myc deleted develop multi-organ hypoplasia and die during mid-embryogenesis (6Stanton B.R. Perkins A.S. Tessarollo L. Sassoon D.A. Parada L.F.

In general, c-myc expression is associated with cell proliferation and is down-regulated in quiescent and differentiated cells. The protein encoded by c-myc is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factors (5Grandori C. Cowley S.M. James L.P. Eisenman R.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The first PCR for 5′-RACE was performed using the primer, mimitin-RACE-1 (5′-GCTGCTGGGAGCCACTGAGGGTTCT-3′, a sequence in the EST clone AI803230) and the AP1 primer provided by the supplier. Nested PCR was performed using the mimitin-RACE-2 primer (5′-GCATGGCCTTTAATTTGAGTTTGAAC-3′), which corresponds to a sequence in the upstream region of mimitin-RACE-1, and the AP2 primer provided by the supplier.

In brief, T98Gmycer-2 cells were plated into a dish and cultured in medium supplemented with 0.25% fetal calf serum for 20–24 h. One μg of the reporter plasmids and 20 ng of pRL-cytomegalovirus as an internal transfection marker were transfected. Ten to 12 h later, OHT was added to activate the MycER chimeric protein, and cells were further cultured for 9–12 h. Cells were then collected and analyzed for luciferase activity. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (15Tsuneoka M. Koda Y. Soejima M. Teye K. Kimura H. J. Biol.

HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, stained with an indirect immunofluoresence staining technique, and observed as described previously (15Tsuneoka M.

T98G cells were fractionated into enriched mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, using a mitochondria/cytosol fractionation kit (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA, catalog number K256-100). Introduction of siRNA into Cells—A small interference RNA molecule (siRNA) targeting human c-myc and a control siRNA (Ambion, Austin, TX, catalog number 4604) were purchased. The siRNA sequences targeting human mimitin, which are positions 72–90 (si-mimitin-1) and 330–348 (si-mimitin-2) relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon and the 2-nucleotide 3′ overhang of deoxythymidine, were chemically synthesized (Hokkaido System Science, Sapporo, Japan). Transfection was carried out with 200 pmol of siRNA per well using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as described previously (15Tsuneoka M. Koda Y. Soejima M. Teye K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35450-35459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Tissues and Immunostaining—Routinely processed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded specimens from 35 Japanese patients with ESCC operated on from 1997 to 1998 at the Department of Surgery of Kurume University Hospital were used. One block containing a marginal region of tumor was selected from each patient. The specimens were assigned a TNM stage based on the UICC criteria for tumor classification (35Sobin L.H. Wittekind C. Sixth Ed. UICC (International Union Against Cancer, TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors. John Wiley & Sons, New York2002Google Scholar). Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were also classified according to the histopathological grading system as well (G1), moderately (G2), or poorly (G3) differentiated. Histopathological grades and stagings were determined by two pathologists. The characteristics of the tissues are outlined under Supplemental Materials Table S1. Immunostaining of tissues was performed essentially as described before (33Teye K. Tsuneoka M. Arima N. Koda Y. Nakamura Y. Ueta Y. Shirouzu K. Kimura H. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This study was approved by the institutional ethics review board of Kurume University. For evaluation of the level of staining by antibodies, the most highly stained area of each section was scored on a scale from 0 to 4 by visual observation. To estimate the percentage of stained cells, the numbers of positive and negative cells in a field were counted and expressed as the percentage of cells stained. More than 500 cells in each section were counted. A staining index was calculated as staining intensity × average percentage of cells stained. Tissues were scored by two independent observers (N. A. and M. T.) without prior knowledge of the patients' other data with a very high correlation between scores (p < 0.0001). Statistical Analysis—The Mimitin staining index was compared with the cell proliferation index (the staining index for Ki-67), the staining index for c-Myc, histopathological grade, stage of cancer, and age of patient by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient and statistical test of independence, using the statistical analysis program StatView version 5 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Identification of mimitin as a Myc-controlled Gene—To conditionally induce c-Myc activity, the estrogen-inducible Myc system (12Tsuneoka M. Nakano F. Ohgusu H. Mekada E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 36Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. Bishop J.M. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 37Tsuneoka M. Mekada E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was used. The chimeric protein c-MycER consists of c-Myc and the estrogen-binding domain of the estrogen receptor. c-MycER anchors to cytoskeletal components of cells in the absence of estrogen. When estrogen or its analogous molecule OHT binds to the chimeric protein, it becomes free to function as c-Myc. The human glioblastoma cell line T98G expressing the c-MycER protein (T98Gmycer-2 cells) was established previously (15Tsuneoka M. Koda Y. Soejima M. Teye K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35450-35459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Total RNAs from T98Gmycer-2 cells in an exponentially growing phase in the presence or absence of OHT for 20 h were processed by cDNA microarray analysis. To shed light on a new facet of c-Myc functions, we focused on human EST sequences among genes stimulated by c-MycER activation. The signal for the EST clone AI803230 was stimulated 2.2-fold with c-Myc activation. This stimulation rate was similar to those of the Myc target genes, ODC (2.6-fold), nucleolin (1.6-fold), and mina53 (1.9-fold), measured in this study. cDNAs encoding the 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream parts of EST clone AI803230 were isolated using the 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE protocols from a library of human erythroid leukemia cells. It was found that EST AI803230 includes part of the cDNA that encodes a protein of 169 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 19.9 kDa (Fig. 1A). When an antibody raised against this protein was used in Western blotting, a band of about 20 kDa, which has a similar mobility to that predicted from the amino acid sequence, was detected in T98G cells (Fig. 1B, left panel). When T98G cells were transfected with mammalian expression plasmids coding this protein or the c-Myc-tagged protein, this antibody recognized a 20-kDa band with increased intensity and a slowly migrating band (Fig. 1B, right panel) in the cell lysates. As described later (Fig. 3), the treatment of cells with siRNAs specific for this gene specifically reduced the intensity of the band. These results indicate that this antibody specifically recognized the protein. When c-MycER was activated in T98Gmycer-2 cells by OHT, the intensity of the band was increased, whereas that for β-actin was not (Fig. 1B). The c-MycER activation in T98Gmycer-2 cells had little effect on cell proliferation (data not shown). These results suggest that the expression of this protein can be induced by c-Myc without necessarily stimulating cell proliferation. Subcellular localization of this protein was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Fig. 1C, the protein was present in the cytoplasmic region of cells with a maze-like localization. Double staining with antibodies against this protein and Tom20 (a component of the preprotein translocase of the outer membrane of mitochondria) (Fig. 1C) or cytochrome c (data not shown) indicated that staining for this protein was mostly consistent with mitochondria. We also detected mitochondrial localization of this protein when the c-myc-tagged construct was transfected and the tagged protein was detected by anti-Tag antibody (9E10) (data not shown). Therefore, we refer to this gene and the protein, respectively, as mimitin and Mimitin (Myc-induced mitochondrial protein). We also used a biochemical approach to study Mimitin subcellular localization. Cells were fractionated into enriched mitochondria and cytosolic fractions, and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against Mimitin, a cytosolic protein (MAPK/ERK), and a mitochondrial protein (Tom22) (32Saeki K. Suzuki H. Tsuneoka M. Maeda M. Iwamoto R. Hasuwa H. Shida S. Takahashi T. Sakaguchi M. Endo T. Miura Y. Mekada E. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31996-32002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 1D show that Mimitin was fractionated into the mitochondrial fraction but not into the cytosolic fraction, further supporting our observation that Mimitin is a mitochondrial protein. Mimitin Is Conserved in Human and Mouse—Mouse cDNA that appears to be a homologue of human mimitin was found by a Blast search (GenBank™ accession number AK007894). The predicted amino acid sequence for mouse Mimitin was aligned with that of human Mimitin (Fig. 1A). The open reading frame of mouse mimitin encodes a 168-amino acid protein. The human and mouse amino acid sequences of Mimitin proteins are 80% identical to each other, suggesting that mimitin is conserved in mammals. There is an ATP/GTP binding motif (P-loop within amino acid positions 146–153 in human Mimitin) in human and mouse Mimitin (Fig. 1A). A domain called Complex1_17_2kD (Fig. 1A, surrounded by a dotted line), was detected using the SMART program (38Letunic I. Copley R.R. Schmidt S. Ciccarelli F.D. Doerks T. Schultz J. Ponting C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D142-D144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide 3 bp upstream of the methionine initiation codon is G in mimitin of both species, conforming to a Kozak consensus sequence (39Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). Expression of mimitin mRNA—The expression profile of mimitin mRNA was examined. As shown in Fig. 2A, serum stimulation of serum-starved T98G cells resulted in a detectable increase at 6 h and a 3-fold increase in the expression of mimitin mRNA at 12–15 h. An increase of the c-myc mRNA level was detected at 3 h after serum addition. The expression of GAPDH, which is widely used as a control, is high in cells overexpressing c-Myc, but is not directly controlled by c-Myc (40Osthus R.C. Shim H. Kim S. Li Q. Reddy R. Mukherjee M. Xu Y. Wonsey D. Lee L.A. Dang C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21797-21800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). By 9 h, the expression of GAPDH mRNA was almost unchanged, but a 2-fold increase was detectable at 12–15 h. These results suggest that up-regulation of mimitin mRNA followed the increase of c-myc mRNA, and preceded the increase of GAPDH mRNA. In human promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells, cell proliferation is arrested and the c-myc expression level is reduced by 12-O-etradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (41Hozumi M. Adv.

https://openalex.org/W1983559665,"Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are toxins involved in plant defense. How the plant prevents autotoxicity is not yet fully understood. The present study is the first structural evidence of a naturally inhibited form of RIP from a plant. Himalayan mistletoe RIP (HmRIP) was purified from Viscum album leaves and crystallized with lactose. The structure was determined by the molecular replacement method and refined at 2.8-Å resolution. The crystal structure revealed the presence of high quality non-protein electron density at the active site, into which a pteridine derivative (2-amino 4-isopropyl 6-carboxyl pteridine) was modeled. The carboxyl group of the ligand binds strongly with the key active site residue Arg162, nullifies the positive charge required for catalysis, and thereby acts as a natural inhibitor. Lectin subunits of RIPs have two active sugar-binding sites present in 1α- and 2γ-subdomains. A third functionally active site has been identified in the 1β-subdomain of HmRIP. The 1β-site is active despite the absence of conserved polar sugar-binding residues. Loss of these residues is compensated by the following: (i) the presence of an extended site where the penultimate sugar also interacts with the protein; (ii) the interactions of galactose with the protein main chain carbonyl and amide nitrogen atoms; (iii) the presence of a well defined pocket encircled by four walls; and (iv) a favorable stacking of the galactose ring with Tyr66 besides the conserved Phe75. The mode of sugar binding is also distinct at the 1α and 2γ sugar-binding sites. Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are toxins involved in plant defense.

Ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) 1The abbreviations used are: RIP, ribosome-inactivating protein; HmRIP, Himalayan mistletoe RIP; AICP, 2-amino 4-isopropyl 6-carboxyl pteridine. 1The abbreviations used are: RIP, ribosome-inactivating protein; HmRIP, Himalayan mistletoe RIP; AICP, 2-amino 4-isopropyl 6-carboxyl pteridine. are translation inhibitors, mainly present in plants (1Nielsen K. Boston R.S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 785-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). They act as defense proteins in plants (2Park S.W. Vepachedu R. Sharma N. Vivanco J.M. Planta. 2004; 219: 1093-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 3Park S.W. Stevens N.M. Vivanco J.M. Planta. 2002; 216: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that they can directly inhibit the plant pathogens by inactivating their ribosomes, causing cell death (4Lam S.K. Ng T.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 393: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). RIPs inhibit translation by their N-glycosidase activity. They remove a specific adenine (4324) from the universally conserved GAGA hairpin loop in 28 S rRNA. This abolishes the ability of rRNA to bind to the elongation factor and, thus, inhibits protein synthesis (5Endo Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8735-8739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RIPs not only release adenine from the rRNA but also DNA as well as poly(A) under in vitro conditions (6Peumans W.J. Hao Q. van Damme E.J.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1493-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 7Barbieri L. Valbonesi P. Bonora E. Gorini P. Bolognesi A. Stirpe F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Based on the number and nature of subunits, RIPs are broadly classified into the following two types: (i) type I, monomeric glycoproteins with a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa; and (ii) type II, heterodimeric proteins having an enzymatic and a lectin subunit of ∼30 kDa each. Type III RIPs are the newly discovered monomeric proteins (<30 kDa) present in the inactive form in the cytoplasm that get activated upon removal of a catalytic peptide (8Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Lehmann J. Becker W. Apel K. Partheir B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7012-7016Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). RIPs are pharmacologically important proteins (9Parikh B.A. Tumer N.E. Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 523-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), having potential applications in the treatment of deadly diseases in humans such as cancer and AIDS (10Bolognesi A. Polito L. Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 563-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 11Elhaggar S. Arch AIDS Res. 1993; 7: 120-121PubMed Google Scholar). Immunotoxins have been synthesized by linking RIPs with the antibodies developed against a surface constituent of the tumor cells. The immunotoxins specifically recognize and kill the tumor cells by inhibiting their protein synthesis and show promising results both in vitro and in vivo. The autologous toxicity of RIPs on the plant ribosomes under in vitro conditions has been demonstrated by several workers, but how the plants prevent the autotoxicity in vivo is not yet fully understood (12Motto M. Lupotto E. Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 2004; 4: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 13Harley S. Beevers H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5935-5938Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It seems that plants have evolved some cellular protective mechanisms to ensure their survival. Compartmentalization of the toxin into specific cell organelles is one of the proposed strategies (14Frigerio L. Roberts L.M. J. Exp. Bot. 1998; 49: 1473-1480Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The presence of cellular inhibitors is another possibility. Many hydrolytic enzymes stored in plant vacuoles are known to be present in naturally inhibited form (15Elpidina E.N. Voskoboynikova N.E. Belozersky M.A. Dunaevsky Y.E. Planta. 1991; 185: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The enzyme inhibitor complex gets dissociated when required, and the degradation of the substrate is initiated. Several investigators have proposed the presence of natural inhibitors for RIPs also (16Hartley M.R. Chaddock J.A. Bonness M.S. Trends Plant Sci. 1996; 1: 260-268Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The natural inhibitor of a type I RIP from Phytolacca americana, PAP, has been purified and characterized (17Desvoyes B. Poyet J.C. Schlick J.L. Adami P. Jouvenot P.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Schlick J.L. Desvoyes B. Hakil M. Adami P. Dulieu P. Plant Sci. 1999; 140: 1-10Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, no such natural inhibitor for the type II RIPs has yet been identified. The mistletoe RIPs are of type II family derived from the hemi-parasitic plant Viscum album. They constitute the active principle of the anti-tumor mistletoe preparations widely used in Europe (19Heiny B.N. Albrecht V. Beuth J. Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 583-586PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hajto T. Hostanska K. Gabius H.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4803-4808PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly the antitumor effect appears to be the result of their immunomodulatory properties rather than toxicity (21Kovacs E. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2000; 54: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22Gabius H.J. Gabius S. Lectins and Cancer. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg, Germany1991Crossref Google Scholar). The clinical studies have shown that the lectin subunit of ML-I enhances the secretion of cytokines and interleukins and increases the number of natural killer cells. Because recognition and binding to the sugar chains present on the cell surface of immunogenic cells are proposed as being the first step in the biological activity (23Lee R.T. Gabius H.J. Lee Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23722-23727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the variations in the sugar binding properties of the RIPs have significance in determining their medicinal potential. The lectin moiety not only recognizes the glycoproteins and glycolipids present on the cell surface but also binds to the intracellular galactose receptors and facilitates the routing of toxin within the cells (24Youle R.J. Murray G.L. Neville D.M.J. Cell. 1981; 23: 551-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Consequently, unveiling the mode of sugar binding has immense potential in understanding the mechanism of action of RIPs. The Himalayan mistletoe ribosome inactivating protein (HmRIP) has been purified from Viscum album, inhabiting the northwestern Himalayas (25Mishra V. Sharma R.S. Yadav S. Babu C.R. Singh T.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 288-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is known for its unique sugar binding properties. In the present study, the natural complex formed between HmRIP and its inhibitor (2-amino 4-isopropyl 6-carboxyl pteridine) was crystallized with lactose, and the structure was determined at 2.8-Å resolution. Plant Material and Purification of HmRIP in Its Natural Form— Field surveys of the northwestern Himalayas were carried out for the collection of plant material. The Gouraghati reserve forest, at a height of >6000 feet in the Chakrata ranges of the Himalayas was selected as the sampling site. Himalayan mistletoe (V. album), the hemi-parasitic plant parasitizing the wild apple (Pyrus pashia), was collected along with the host stem and brought to the lab and stored at -20 °C. The frozen leaf tissues were crushed into fine powder in presence of liquid nitrogen. The total soluble protein was extracted in 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl (pH 3.5). Crude extract was filtered through a muslin cloth and centrifuged at 12 000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered through 0.2-μ filter. An affinity chromatography column was packed with partially hydrolyzed Sepharose 4B (25Mishra V. Sharma R.S. Yadav S. Babu C.R. Singh T.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 423: 288-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and equilibrated with sodium acetate buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl (pH 3.5). The sterile filtered crude extract was loaded on the affinity column. The unbound proteins were washed off with the same buffer. The bound protein was eluted as a single peak with 0.2 m lactose in the same buffer. All of the fractions forming the peak were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Crystallization of HmRIP-I with Lactose—A concentrated sample of the HmRIP and lactose complex (0.1 m) was prepared in 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer (pH 3.5). The reservoir solution contained 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 3.5), 25% (NH4)2SO4 and 0.2 mm NaCl. The 10-μl drops of protein solution were made and placed on the cover slips for the hanging drop vapor diffusion method against the reservoir solution of 1000 μl in a vial. After 3 weeks, hexagonal bipyramidal crystals were obtained at 298 K. X-ray Intensity Data Collection and Processing—The x-ray intensity data were collected using synchrotron beam line X13 operated by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory outstation at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany on a MAR image plate scanner. The crystals were flash-frozen to 100 K. Using a wavelength of λ = 0.8459-Å resolution, the data were processed with DENZO and SCALE-PACK programs (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the native HmRIP structure were used as the starting model (28Mishra V. Ethayathulla A.S. Sharma R.S. Yadav S. Krauspenhaar R. Betzel C. Babu C.R. Singh T.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2295-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A distinct solution was obtained for a single heterodimer (having the enzyme, an A chain and lectin, a B chain), which gave a correlation coefficient and R-factor of 58.7 and 42.2%, respectively, after rigid body refinement. The model was refined using REFMAC (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Because, the solvent content of the crystals of HmRIP was high (73%), TLS refinement was carried out (30Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). Two rigid bodies were defined as chains A and B, and their movements were modeled. This improved the quality of electron density. Both of the chains were manually adjusted separately using program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) into the improved density with intermittent cycles of refinement with REFMAC. This gave an R-factor of 0.32. The model was rebuilt extensively using maps calculated at this stage. This map also showed good electron densities for carbohydrate moieties at Asn107 in chain A and Asn57, Asn92, and Asn132 in chain B, galactose and lactose molecules at sugar-binding sites in chain B, and a ligand at the active site in chain A. The electron densities clearly allowed the interpretation of one N-acetyl glucosamine molecule at Asn107 in chain A (Fig. 1A, NAG1), two N-acetyl glucosamine residues and one mannose residue at Asn57 (Fig. 1B, NAG1, NAG2, and MAN3), two N-acetyl glucosamine residues at Asn92 (Fig. 1C, NAG1 and NAG2), and two N-acetyl glucosamine and two mannose residues at Asn132 (Fig. 1D, NAG1, NAG2, MAN3, and MAN4) in chain B. The good electron density also allowed us to model one galactose molecule at the 1α sugar binding site (Fig. 2A), and one lactose molecule each at the 1β (Fig. 2B) and 2γ (Fig. 2C) sugar-binding sites. For the first time a sugar molecule has been identified at the 1β sugar-binding site. Yet another non-protein density was clearly interpreted as the 2-amino 4-isopropyl 6-carboxyl pteridine (AICP) molecule, presumably as a potent inhibitor of HmRIP (Fig. 3). 107 water molecules were also included in the model provided they met the criteria of peaks >3 σ in |Fo - Fc| maps and hydrogen bond partners with appropriate distance and angle geometry. All of these residues/molecules were included in the further cycles of refinement and manual model building. The model was improved by calculating a series of omit maps at each stage of refinement. The final R and Rfree factors were 0.234 and 0.287, respectively. A Ramachandran plot of the main chain torsion angles (φ, Ψ) shows that 81.3% of the residues are in the most favored regions as defined in the program PROCHEK (32Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (2760) Google Scholar, 33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

It is a heterodimer containing a chain A with N-glycosidase activity and a chain B with lectin activity. On the other hand, a closely related member of the family ML-I can exist as a heterodimer as well as a tetramer consisting of two heterodimers. The chain A is divided into two non-homologous domains (Fig. 4), A1 (1–13, 44–155) and A2 (14–43, 156–239). A significant deletion after Ser88 in the domain A1 results in the loss of one complete helix. This domain is comprised of one mixed β-sheet and three α-helices, α2, α3, and α4 (28Mishra V. Ethayathulla A.S. Sharma R.S. Yadav S. Krauspenhaar R. Betzel C. Babu C.R. Singh T.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2295-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), in contrast to the four helices observed in ML-I, ricin, abrin, ebulin, trichosanthin, etc. The helix α4 crosses over from the A1 to the A2 domain. The A2 domain contains four α-helices, α1 and α5–α7, and four β-strands, β2-β3, β9, and β10. The N-glycosidase activity site is situated in the cleft formed by the association of domains A1 and A2 (Fig. 4). Tyr75, Tyr110, Glu159, Arg162, and Trp193 are the key residues involved in substrate binding and catalytic activity. In the A1 domain of the HmRIP, a 22-Å-wide cavity has been identified as the ribosome recognition site (28Mishra V. Ethayathulla A.S. Sharma R.S. Yadav S. Krauspenhaar R. Betzel C. Babu C.R. Singh T.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2295-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The conserved β-strands β5 and β6 form the base of the cleft, whereas the loops between β3 and β4, β8 and α2, and β7 and β8 form the walls. Four conserved residues, Arg51, Asp70, Thr72, and Asn73, represent the binding residues. The ribosome recognition site is a shallow cleft present on the surface, whereas the N-glycosidase activity site corresponds to a well defined deep pocket. Both sites are clearly connected through a shallow channel. The distinct demarcation between the ribosome recognition site and the N-glycosidase activity site and the gigantic size of substrates such as the ribosome suggest a double step mechanism of action. In this mechanism the ribosome binds to the ribosome recognition site first, which holds it in a favorable way for the attack against the rRNA in the second step. The basic structure of chain B is highly conserved among the type II RIPs (34Niwa H. Tonevitsky A.G. Agapov I.I. Saward S. Pfüller U. Palmer R.A. Eur. J.

Biol. 1995; 250: 354-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It folds into two well separated homologous domains, B1 (1–132) and B2 (133–255). Each of these two domains is mainly comprised of three subdomains i.e. α, β, and γ (Fig. 4). The α- and β-subdomains are represented by a pair of anti-parallel β-sheets joined by a loop. The γ-subdomains are truncated and lack the C-terminal strand from the second β-sheet. All of the subdomains except the 1α and 1γ contain a 310 helix in between the two β sheets. λ-Subdomains, which are unrelated to the α-, β-, and γ-subdomains, also constitute part of chain B. The 1λ-subdomain connects chain A with chain B and the 2λ-subdomain links the domain B1 with domain B2. Subdomains 1β, 2α, and 2β contain an S–S bond between the conserved Cys residues. On the other hand, the substitutions of Asn17 and Ser36 for Cys residues in the 1α-subdomain rule out the formation of the standard disulfide bond. The homologous disulfide bridge is also absent in ML-I, although it is conserved in ricin, abrin, and ebulin. The lack of an S–S bond and involvement of the amino acid residues Tyr64, Ala68, Gly69, Val70, Arg21, Asp22, Gly28, Gln30, Ser107, Ile110, Thr114, and Gln118 were proposed to be responsible for the tetramerization of ML-I (34Niwa H. Tonevitsky A.G. Agapov I.I. Saward S. Pfüller U. Palmer R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 2739-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Despite all these features, HmRIP remains in the heterodimeric form. The chains A and B of HmRIP are associated mainly by hydrophobic and a few polar interactions. The H-bond between Glu205 (A) Oϵ2 and Arg50 (B) NH1 is one of the specific interactions joining A and B subunits of HmRIP. Because of the substitution of Glu205 by Asp in ML-I, the homologous interaction is absent. HmRIP in Its Naturally Inhibited Form—The HmRIP is localized inside the plant vacuole (40.Mishra, V. (2004) Ribosome Inactivating Protein of Viscum album (L.) from North-western Himalaya: Purification and Characterization. Ph.D. thesis, University of Delhi, Delhi, IndiaGoogle Scholar), which has an acidic environment. In the present study, HmRIP was purified and crystallized under acidic conditions (pH 3.5). The present crystal structure represents the model of HmRIP under acidic conditions. It was remarkable to observe an excellent quality of non-protein electron density at the active site (Fig. 3). The density was highly characteristic, into which an AICP molecule was modeled nicely. It showed clear contacts with the key active site residue, Arg162, even at the 2.5 σ cutoff in the |2Fo - Fc| map. Synthetic pteridine derivatives have been identified as some of the most potent inhibitors of RIPs in vitro (41Kurinov I.V. Myers D.E. Irvin J.D. Uckun F.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1765-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 42Yan X. Hollis T. Svinth M. Day P. Monzingo A.F. Milne G.W.A. Robertus J.D. J. Mol.

Toxicon. 1996; 34: 1325-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Some of the pteridine derivatives are also abundant in plant vacuoles and are known to inhibit the enzymes involved in the purine metabolism (44Oettle K. Reibnegger G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Based on these data and the highly characteristic electron density, it was clear that a derivative of pteridine was the most compatible molecule at the active site. The side groups were added to the pteridine ring structure, taking clues from the electron density and the negative-positive electrostatic regions of the active site. The AICP molecule matched perfectly in the active site and interacted effectively. AICP molecule adopts an excellent orientation and operates like a specific lid blocking the gate of the active site of HmRIP. The side chain of Tyr110 was found flipped outside in the most contrasting manner and provides sufficient space to the inhibitor. The AICP ligand forms several interactions with a number of key residues at the N-glycosidase active site of the toxin subunit (Fig. 5A). The most significant interactions are formed between the carboxyl group of the inhibitor and the guanidium group of Arg162. Tyr75 OH also interacts with the N5 atom of the ligand. It may be mentioned that the Arg162 and Tyr75 have been identified as the most critical residues for the N-glycosidase activity of RIPs (45Bagga S. Seth D. Batra J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4813-4820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Tyr110 N and Ser109 Oγ interact with the AICP atoms N8 and N1, respectively. In addition to the hydrogen bonds, the propyl group of the inhibitor forms hydrophobic interactions with Leu237. This is in direct contrast with most of the synthetic inhibitors, which rely mainly on the bonds formed with the main chain carbonyl and amide nitrogen atoms of Gly108 and Val76, which belong to the β8-α2 loop and the β6 strand, respectively. They may also have a weak N–N bond with the key catalytic Arg. The pteroic acid based inhibitors of ricin and ebulin make only a few contacts with Arg162. Several mechanisms have been proposed for N-glycosidase activity of RIPs (39Gu Y.J. Xia Z.X. Proteins. 2000; 39: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 46Ren J. Wang Y. Dong Y. Stuart D. Structure. 1994; 2: 7-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 47Ready M.P. Kim Y. Robertus J.D. Proteins. 1991; 10: 270-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Except for one (48Huang Q. Liu S. Tang Y. Jin S. Wang Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), all of the mechanisms commonly highlight the essentiality of the positive charge at Arg162 for catalysis. The importance of the positive charge was also confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis (49Day P.J. Ernst S.R. Frankel A.E. Monzingo A.F. Pascal J.M. Molin-Svinth M.C. Robertus J.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11098-11103Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is very clear from the interactions that the AICP molecule specifically and strongly binds with the active site Arg162. The carboxyl group of the AICP nullifies the positive charge on the Arg162, which is essential for catalysis and thereby inhibits the activity of HmRIP. In contrast, synthetic inhibitors of ricin and ebulin are deeply embedded inside the cleft, mimicking the adenine base and other substrate analogs (Fig. 5B) (42Yan X. Hollis T. Svinth M. Day P.

https://openalex.org/W2026535872,"Cks proteins are adapter molecules that coordinate the assembly of multiprotein complexes. They share the ability to domain swap by exchanging a β-strand, β4. Here we use NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dynamic properties of human Cks1 and its response on assembly with components of the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligation machinery. In the NMR experiment with the free form of Cks1, a subset of residues displayed elevated R2 values and the cross-peaks of neighboring residues were missing from the spectrum, indicating a substantial conformational exchange contribution on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. Strikingly the region of greatest conformational variability was the β4-strand that domain swaps to form the dimer. Binding of the ligand common to all Cks proteins, Cdk2, suppressed the conformational heterogeneity. This response was specific to Cdk2 binding; in contrast, binding of Skp2, a ligand unique to human Cks1, did not alter the dynamic behavior. Short time (<5 ns) molecular dynamics simulations indicate that residues of Cks1 that form the binding site for phosphorylated ligands are considerably more flexible in the free form of Cks1 than they are in the Cdk2-Cks1 complex. A cooperative interaction between Cdk2 and Cks1 is suggested, which reduces the configurational entropy of Cks1 and therefore facilitates phosphoprotein binding. Indications of an unusual dynamic behavior of strand β4 in the free form of Cks1 were obtained from longer time scale (50 ns) dynamics simulations. A spontaneous reversible unzipping of hydrogen bonds between β4 and β2 was observed, suggesting an early intermediate structure for unfolding and/or domain swapping. We propose that the dynamic properties of the β-sheet and its modification upon ligand binding underlie the domain swapping ability and the adapter function of Cks proteins.

Cks proteins were first identified as functioning in the control of the cell cycle by binding to cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) and regulating its function in some, as yet unknown, way (1Pines J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1399-1402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is only recently, however, that their involvement in targeted protein degradation via the ubiquitin pathway has been discovered. First, in what is thought to be the canonical Cks function, it was found that they are required for the activating phosphorylation of the ubiquitin ligase APC (anaphase promoting complex) (2Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2549-2559Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 3Shteinberg M. Hershko A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The main difference is that some of the homologues have additional sequences at the N and C termini and a longer loop between the α-helices. The core structure is a four-stranded β-sheet. One face of the β-sheet forms the binding site for Cdk2, while on the other face there is a cluster of conserved residues that is thought to bind phosphorylated proteins (referred to as the phosphate-binding site) (7Bourne Y.

The less conserved α-helical region caps one end of the β-sheet and biochemical and mutagenesis studies have shown that this part of the protein binds the substrate recognition component, Skp2, of the SCF (6Sitry D. Seeliger M.A. Ko T.K. Ganoth D. Breward S.E. Itzhaki L.S. Pagano M. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42233-42240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Domain swapping has been observed for several Cks proteins with the C-terminal β-strand, β4, exchanging with another molecule to form a dimer pair (8Bourne Y. Arvai A.S. Bernstein S.L. Watson M.H.

Science. 1993; 262: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The process is mediated by a “hinge loop” sequence, and two conserved proline residues in the hinge loop are the main determinants of whether the protein adopts the monomer or the dimer form: mutation of the first or second proline creates an obligate monomer or dimer, respectively, whereas mutation of any other residue in the hinge loop has little effect on the monomer-dimer equilibrium (11Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J.W. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5596-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although the biological pathways through which Cks proteins act have been identified, the underlying mechanistic role remains to be determined. They have been proposed to function as macromolecular adapters or docking factors. In the context of their canonical function, they are thought to facilitate or direct the binding of Cdk2 to a partly phosphorylated substrate such as APC by binding both Cdk2 and the phosphoprotein simultaneously. One requirement is therefore the presence of multiple binding sites. A second requirement may be the interdependence of these binding sites. Support for such a model came first from our domain swapping studies, which revealed allosteric behavior whereby a change in the conformation of the Cdk2-binding site altered the ligand affinity of the phosphate-binding site (12Schymkowitz J.W. Rousseau F. Wilkinson H.R. Friedler A. Itzhaki L.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 888-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Also, we have shown that human Cks1 directs the SCFSkp2 ubiquitination machinery to its target p27 by binding Skp2, Cdk2, and p27 in a synergistic manner (13Seeliger M.A. Breward S.E. Friedler A.

To investigate the structural requirements of an adapter molecule, we have used NMR TROSY (transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy) (14Riek R. Pervushin K. Wuthrich K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 462-468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar) and molecular dynamics simulations to probe the dynamic behavior of Cks1 and its response upon stepwise assembly with the components of the SCFSkp2 machinery. We show by NMR experiments that uncomplexed Cks1 is a conformationally heterogeneous molecule and that the most labile region maps to β4, the β-strand that undergoes domain swapping. Cks1 responds differently to binding different ligands. While the binding of Skp2 does not change the dynamic properties, the binding of the canonical Cks ligand, Cdk2, suppresses the heterogeneity. To gain more detailed information about the effect of Cdk2 binding on the flexibility of Cks1, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for free Cks1 and Cks1 in complex with Cdk2 using implicit (EEF1 (16Lazaridis T. Karplus M. Proteins. 1999; 35: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar)) and explicit water solvation. The experiments and simulations both show that the binding of Cdk2 restricts the conformational flexibility of Cks1 residues that comprise the phosphate-binding site, supporting a cooperative interaction between Cdk2 and Cks1 for the binding of phosphorylated ligands. Longer time scale dynamics (50 ns) were performed to provide insights into the unusual dynamic behavior of β4 detected by NMR. Cross-correlations observed in the simulations were used to examine coupling among the motion of different portions of Cks1 before and after Cdk2 binding. The results suggest that a dynamic response to ligand binding, i.e. a change in overall flexibility and a redistribution of conformations, contributes to the allostery (17Wand A.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 926-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 18Kern D. Zuiderweg E.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 748-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), rather than the more classical “enthalpic” mechanism of allostery induced by discrete structural changes. Escherichia coli expression plasmid for GST-Cdk2 was a generous gift of J. A. Endicott, University of Oxford, and GST-Skp1/Skp2 was a generous gift of A. Hershko, Technion, Haifa, Israel. Isotopes were obtained from Goss Scientific Instrument Ltd., Chelmsford, UK, and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. C41 or BL21DE3 cells were transformed with the previously described expression vector for Cks1 (19Seeliger M.A. Schymkowitz J.W. Rousseau F. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and grown in 2 × TY medium (1.5% (w/v) tryptone, 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.5% (w/v) sodium chloride) containing ampicillin at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 0.6. They were then harvested in sterile centrifuge bottles by centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 rpm at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in M9 medium in D2O with the appropriate carbon (glucose or [13C]glucose) and nitrogen sources (15NH4Cl), using twice the initial rich medium volume. Cells were grown for a further 2 h at 25 °C and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside overnight at 25 °C. Expression of Cdk2 and Skp1-Skp2 was carried out as described previously (13Seeliger M.A. Breward S.E. Friedler A. Schon O. Itzhaki L.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Proteins were purified by nickel affinity (Cks1) or glutathione affinity methods (Cdk2, Skp1-Skp2) followed by gel filtration (Superdex G75, Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were judged to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. Mass spectrometry showed that Cks1 samples were >90% labeled with the appropriate isotopes. Samples were prepared for NMR in 100 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% D2O, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The protein complexes were assembled with Cdk2 and/or Skp1-Skp2 in slight excess relative to Cks1. The complex was then dialyzed in the same beaker as a control sample of free Cks1, and NMR spectra were subsequently recorded in parallel. Samples were concentrated to ∼150 mm using VivaSpin concentrators (VivaScience), then filtered and extensively degassed. To confirm that the Cks1 complexes were formed and remained assembled during NMR data acquisition, an aliquot of the NMR sample was loaded on a gel filtration column. An elution peak was observed at the volume expected for the respective complex. There were also minor peaks at volumes expected for Cdk2 and/or Skp1-Skp2 corresponding to the slight excess relative to Cks1 (used to ensure there was no free Cks1 in solution). Spectra were recorded at 298 K on Bruker DRX 600 and DRX 800 NMR spectrometers. Sequence-specific resonance assignments for 2H,15N,13C-labeled Cks1 wild type, both free and in complex with Cdk2, were made based on the following triple-resonance TROSY experiments: HN(CO)CA, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB (as reviewed in Ref. 20Ferentz A.E. Wagner G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 29-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). 15N-Edited three-dimensional NOESY experiments were acquired using 15N-labeled Cks1 to confirm and extend sequential assignments. For the resonance assignment of Cks1 in complex with Cdk2, the 1:1 complex of Cks1 was preformed with unlabeled Cdk2. Data were processed and analyzed with Felix 97 (Micron Separations). TROSY-HSQC spectra of 2H,15N-labeled Cks1 in complex with (unlabeled) Skp1-Skp2, with Cdk2, and with Skp1-Skp2 and Cdk2 were also recorded in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5% D2O, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (a buffer required for optimal stability of the Skp1-Skp2 component). The spectrum of free Cks1 was always recorded at the same time for comparison, using a sample that had been dialyzed in the same beaker as the sample of the complex. Chemical shift changes upon Cdk2 binding were calculated as the root mean square deviation of the chemical shifts of corresponding peaks in free Cks1 compared with those in Cdk2-bound Cks1. The chemical shifts in the 15N dimension were divided by 10 to correct for the gyromagnetic ratio between 1H and 15N nuclei. Thus, r.m.s.d.=(HiCks1-HiCks1/Cdk2)2+NiCks1-NiCks1/Cdk2102(Eq. 1) where HCks1i and NCks1i are the chemical shift of residue i in free Cks1 in the proton/nitrogen dimension, and HCks1/Cdk2i and NCks1/Cdk2i are the respective chemical shifts of residue i in Cks1 in complex with Cdk2. 15N T1 and T2 experiments were recorded at a 15N frequency of 60.13 MHz on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer (as reviewed in Ref. 21Kay L.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). T1 relaxation delays were set to 16, 80, 160, 240, 320, 400, 480, 600, 720, 840, 1000, and 1200 ms. T2 relaxation delays were set to 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, and 240 ms. Peak volumes were fitted to a single exponential decay function using the program Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck Software). In all the experiments a relaxation delay of 3 s was used. The two-dimensional experiments were acquired with 1024 × 128 complex points. All calculations were carried out with the program CHARMM (22Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13969) Google Scholar). For the calculations with implicit solvation the polar-hydrogen topology (PARAM19) with the EEF1 model was used (16Lazaridis T. Karplus M. Proteins. 1999; 35: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), and for the simulations with explicit water the all-hydrogen topology (PARAM22) was employed (23MacKerell A.D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R.L. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J. Guo H. Ha S. Joseph-McCarthy D. Kuchnir L. Kuczera K. Lau F.T.K. Mattos C. Michnick S. Ngo T. Nguyen D.T. Prodhom B. Reiher W.E.

The crystal structure of the complex Cdk2-Cks1 (PDB entry 1BUH) served as starting point for the setup of all structural models. Setup of Structures—The terminal residues 1-4 and 74-79 of Cks1 and 295-298 of Cdk2 are missing in the crystal structure and were neglected in the calculations, i.e. residue 5 of Cks1 was treated as the N terminus and residues 75 of Cks1 and 294 of Cdk2 as the C termini, respectively. Missing intermediate residues 40-46 of Cdk2 were constructed in the following way: initially placed coordinates were first minimized with 2000 steepest descent (SD) and 10,000 adopted basis Newton-Raphson (ABNR) steps. Subsequently, simulated annealing for these residues was performed by molecular dynamics, i.e. the residues were heated up within 20 ps to 2000 K and kept at this temperature for 500 ps and then cooled down to 50 K within 2 ns. The resulting structure was again minimized with 2000 SD and 5000 ABNR steps. The rest of the complex was kept fixed during this procedure. For the calculations of free Cks1 the Cdk2 unit was not present. Minimizations and Normal Mode Analysis—The structures were minimized with 5000 SD and 10,000 ABNR steps. During the first 10,000 minimization steps harmonic restraints were applied to the backbone atoms and the strength of the restraints was slowly decreased to zero. The second derivatives for the normal mode analysis were calculated analytically. The normal mode calculations yielded no negative eigenvalues. The absolute values of the rotation and translation modes are <0.04 cm-1. Molecular Dynamics Simulation—A trajectory of 50 ns was started from the minimized structure of free Cks1 using standard heating and early equilibration protocols (22Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13969) Google Scholar) for the first 20 ps. The system was then coupled to a heat bath (300 K) applying the Berendsen algorithm. The leap-frog integrator was used with a time step of 1 fs (SHAKE constraints for all bonds of hydrogens to heavy atoms). Setup of the Structural Models—To determine the protonation state of the ionizable groups, the corresponding pKa values for free Cks1 and the complex Cdk2-Cks1 were estimated from standard continuum electrostatics calculations (24Bashford D. Karplus M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10219-10225Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Residues His21, His36, and His60 of the Cks1 unit feature pKa values higher than pH 7 in free Cks1 and in the complex as well. Those histidines were protonated; for all other ionizable residues their standard protonation state at pH 7 was used. The N-terminal residue 4 of Cks1 was capped by an acetyl group and the C-terminal residue 74 by an amino methyl group. For the simulation of Cdk2-bound Cks1, residues of Cdk2 further than 44 Å from the center of mass of the Cks1 unit were deleted; and for the simulation of free Cks1 the entire Cdk2 unit was deleted. A sphere of pre-equilibrated modified TIP3 water molecules (radius 37 Å) centered on the center of mass of the Cks1 unit was overlaid, and water molecules overlapping with crystal structure elements were deleted. Crystal waters outside the overlaid sphere were deleted too. This resulted in an extensive solvation of the Cks1 unit with about six to eight water shells surrounding the protein. Bad contacts between the overlaid waters and the crystal structure were removed by performing 100 step of steepest descent minimization keeping protein atoms fixed. The water molecules were relaxed by a short dynamics run of 50 ps at 300 K (see below for details on MD). During this relaxation process, all protein atoms were kept fixed. This overlay and relaxation procedure was repeated five times with different orientations of the overlaying water sphere. This resulted in a total of 6905 TIP3 water molecules for free Cks1 and 6249 TIP3 waters for the Cdk2-bound Cks1, respectively. The outermost water molecules of the water sphere were deleted to obtain a density closest to that of pure water at 300 K and 1 atm (0.0334 molecules/Å3) for the volume occupied by the solvent. This resulted in 6769 waters for free Cks1 and 6147 waters for Cdk2-bound, respectively. Minimizations and Molecular Dynamics—Structures with equilibrated water molecules were minimized by 2000 SD and 5000 ABNR steps. For the minimization of the complex, Cdk2 residues more than 35 Å away from the center of mass of the Cks1 unit were kept fixed, and residues within 28-35 Å were confined to their original positions with harmonic restraints. The harmonic force constant for each residue was chosen proportional to the inverse of the average B-factor of this residue with a proportionality factor 4π2kT/3 (∼7.9 kcal mol-1 for T = 300 K), so that the fluctuations of the harmonic oscillations resembled the experimental fluctuations obtained from the B-factors of the x-ray structures. All other atoms were allowed to move freely. For the minimization of free Cks1, no restraints were used. MD trajectories of 5 ns were started from the minimized structures using stochastic boundary conditions with radius 37 Å (25Brooks C.L. Karplus M. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 6312-6325Crossref Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Water molecules within radius 30-37 Å were treated by Langevin dynamics with a friction coefficient of 62 ps-1 for the water oxygen atoms and a heat bath temperature of 300 K. All other atoms were treated by Newtonian dynamics. The equation of motion was integrated with the leap-verlet integrator using a time step of 2 fs (holomonic SHAKE constraints for all bonds of hydrogens to heavy atoms). All restraints of the minimizations were maintained. To keep the protein centered in the water sphere, the center of mass of the Cks1 unit was harmonically restrained using a force constant 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2. Quasiharmonic Analysis—The Cα coordinates of the Cks1 unit were extracted from snapshots taken every 0.1 ps of the equilibrated MD trajectory (1-5 ns). The mass of each Cα atom was set to the total mass of the corresponding residue. The Cα structures were reoriented to remove translational and rotational modes. Then the mass-weighted fluctuation covariance matrix was diagonalized to obtain the quasihamonic eigenvectors and frequencies (26Andricioaei I. Karplus M. J. Chem. Phys. 2001; 115: 6289-6292Crossref Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Cross-correlation Analysis of Atomic Fluctuations—The Cks1 snapshot structures of the MD trajectory (1-5 ns) were first reoriented to remove translational and rotational modes before the normalized covariance matrix of atomic fluctuations was calculated. The backbone N plots in Fig. 10 only include cross-correlations between backbone N atoms. For the residue cross-correlation, the diagonal elements correspond to averages over all covariance elements involving atoms of the same residue; and the off-diagonal elements are obtained by averaging over all covariance elements involving atoms of two different residues. The HSQC spectrum of the 79-residue Cks1 is shown in Fig. 1B. It was immediately apparent that several cross-peaks were missing from the spectrum and that the cross-peaks observed had large intensity variation. This is indicative of conformational exchange on an intermediate NMR time scale. We screened a range of experimental conditions to eliminate alternative origins of line broadening. Spectra were recorded at protein concentrations from 40 to 1 mm, and no changes were observed in the line widths of the cross-peaks, indicating that aggregation was not involved. Furthermore, analytical ultracentrifugation and size-exclusion chromatography experiments indicate that the protein is >99% monomeric in this protein concentration range (data not shown). We attempted to recover non-observable cross-peaks by varying field strength (experiments were run on spectrometers with proton frequencies between 500 and 800 MHz) and temperature (273-303 K, well below the melting temperature of 328 K). Lowering the temperature to 278 K and increasing the field strength to 800 MHz resulted in additional very faint, broad peaks; however, the spectral quality was not good enough to obtain additional assignments. Experiments optimized for minimal solvent saturation did not recover additional cross-peaks, and this observation, as well as the lack of pH dependence, suggests that the absence of cross peaks for a subset of residues is not associated with rapidly solvent-exchanging amide protons. We also looked at the mutant P62A, because the equivalent mutant (P90A) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cks protein Suc1 was found previously to greatly reduce the line broadening observed for that protein (27Odaert B. Landrieu I. Dijkstra K. Schuurman-Wolters G. Casteels P. Wieruszeski J.M. Inze D. Scheek R. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12375-12381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the case of Cks1, however, there was no significant difference between the spectra of P62A and wild type. Although the formation of a domain-swapped dimer is the other potential cause for the missing cross-peaks, the dissociation constant is too high for the dimer to be significantly populated (the dissociation constant for wild type Cks1 is in the 10 mm range (19Seeliger M.A. Schymkowitz J.W. Rousseau F. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and it is at least an order of magnitude higher for the mutant P62A that showed similar line broadening). Moreover, the time scale of monomer-dimer interconversion is of the order of tens of minutes, much slower than the microsecond-millisecond time scale of conformational exchange that causes line broadening. The HSQC spectrum of Cks1 was assigned using standard triple resonance experiments complemented by NOESY-based techniques. To investigate the conformational exchange process further, the backbone dynamics was analyzed by measuring longitudinal (R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation rates (Fig. 2). The average ratio of R2/R1 of ∼12 (corresponding to a correlation time tc of 10.7 ns) is in the range expected for a 9-kDa protein. This is consistent with the results above that indicate the line broadening is not a result of Cks1 being oligomeric. A subset of residues display elevated R2 values (Arg20 in strand β, His60 and Glu61 in the hinge loop between β3 and β4; these were excluded from the calculation of the R2/R1 ratio), and surrounding these are residues without visible cross-peaks in the HSQC spectrum. These results strongly suggest that chemical exchange on a microsecond to millisecond time scale contributes significantly to the relaxation mechanism at these sites. There was a single structural element for which there were no cross-peaks in the HSQC spectrum of Cks1. This stretch of sequence involves the domain-swapping β-strand 4. In addition to those residues adjacent to the missing cross-peaks, a number of other residues, mostly in the β-sheet, also exhibited significantly higher R2 values than the average, notably residue Arg20 in the phosphate-binding site. Cdk2 binds to one face of the Cks1 β-sheet (Fig. 1A) with an affinity of 1.5 μm (13Seeliger M.A. Breward S.E. Friedler A. Schon O. Itzhaki L.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 718-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We looked at the effect of Cdk2 binding using 13C,15N-labeled Cks1 in complex with unlabeled Cdk2. Due to solubility limitations, Cks1 was at a concentration of 150 μm with Cdk2 in slight excess. To improve the relaxation properties of the 44-kDa complex the side chain protons in Cks1 were perdeuterated (>80%) (28Grzesiek S. Anglister J. Ren H. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4369-4370Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and the spectral quality was improved by incorporation of TROSY building blocks (15Pervushin K. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12366-12371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2079) Google Scholar). The TROSY-HSQC spectrum of Cks1 in the presence of Cdk2 is shown overlaid on that of free Cks1 (Fig. 1C). The two spectra were recorded in parallel on samples that had been dialyzed in the same beaker. The two spectra ar"
