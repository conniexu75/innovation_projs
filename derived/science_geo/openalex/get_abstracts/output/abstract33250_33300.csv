https://openalex.org/W1966387132,"In this report, we describe the isolation, sequence, and initial characterization of the cDNA for the muscle-specific regulatory factor skeletal myogenin. Transfection of myogenin into the mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2 produces cells expressing muscle-specific markers. Myogenin is absent in undifferentiated cells, peaks, and then declines following a stimulus to differentiate, and is overexpressed in myoblasts selected with 5-bromodeoxyuridine for the overproduction of factors that regulate the decision to differentiate. High levels of myogenin transcripts are present in the myotomal region of somites at 8.5 days of gestation in the mouse. Although myogenin and MyoD are different genes, they share the myc homology domain. Myogenin and MyoD thus form part of a gene family regulating myogenesis, and together with myd may constitute a set of factors that interact to regulate the determination and differentiation of muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W2020292310,"A genomic sequence and cloned complementary DNA has been identified for a novel receptor-like gene of the PDGF receptor/CSF1 receptor subfamily (platelet-derived growth factor receptor/colony-stimulating factor type 1 receptor). The gene recognized a 6.4-kilobase transcript that was coexpressed in normal human tissues with the 5.3-kilobase PDGF receptor messenger RNA. Introduction of complementary DNA of the novel gene into COS-1 cells led to expression of proteins that were specifically detected with antiserum directed against a predicted peptide. When the new gene was transfected into COS-1 cells, a characteristic pattern of binding of the PDGF isoforms was observed, which was different from the pattern observed with the known PDGF receptor. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor in response to the PDGF isoforms was also different from the known receptor. The new PDGF receptor gene was localized to chromosome 4q11-4q12. The existence of genes encoding two PDGF receptors that interact in a distinct manner with three different PDGF isoforms likely confers considerable regulatory flexibility in the functional responses to PDGF."
https://openalex.org/W2034442000,"Transgenic mice bearing the pim-1 gene supplemented with an upstream immunoglobulin enhancer and a downstream murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat express pim-1 mRNA at high levels in both B and T cells. Between 5% and 10% of the pim-1 transgenic mice develop clonal T cell lymphomas before 7 months of age, whereas none of the age-matched control mice do, providing direct evidence for the oncogenic potential of pim-1. Histological examination and FACS analysis revealed no abnormalities in hematopoietic tissues of disease-free pim-1 transgenic mice. When newborn pim-1 transgenic mice are infected with MuLV, T cell lymphomas develop much faster (latency 7-8 weeks) than in nontransgenic mice (latency 22 weeks). In all these T cell lymphomas either c-myc or N-myc was activated by proviral insertion, suggesting strong cooperation between pim-1 and myc in lymphomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2048753891,"We have found that R. meliloti strain Rm1021, which is known to synthesize a Calcofluor-binding exopolysaccharide (EPS I), also has a cryptic capacity to synthesize a second exopolysaccharide (EPS II). Structural analysis of EPS II has shown that it differs in many respects from EPS I. Genetic analysis indicates that EPS II synthesis requires the products of at least seven loci on the second symbiotic megaplasmid of R. meliloti, and is induced by a mutation, expR101, which causes increased transcription of these genes. Synthesis of EPS II suppresses the symbiotic defects of EPS I-deficient strains on Medicago sativa (alfalfa), but not on four other plants that are normally hosts for Rm1021. These observations suggest that structural features of bacterial exopolysaccharides are involved in the determination of host range. The implications of these results for models of exopolysaccharide function, such as serving as signals to the plant or shielding the bacteria from plant defense responses, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2088206337,"Reversion analysis has identified four suppressor genes that permit transcription of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HIS4 gene in the absence of GCN4, BAS1, and BAS2, trans-acting proteins normally required for activation of HIS4 transcription. These suppressor genes encode factors that affect the transcription of many diverse genes. Two of these suppressors, SIT1 and SIT2, are encoded by RPB1 and RPB2, the genes for the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II. All strains containing suppressor mutations in RPB1 and RPB2 have reduced transcription of the INO1 gene and an inositol requirement. Mutations in SIT3 or high copy number SIT3 increase HIS4 transcription in the absence of GCN4, BAS1, and BAS2. This increase in HIS4 transcription by high copy number SIT3 or by sit3 alleles is largely independent of the HIS4 TATA sequence. The SIT4 protein is over 50% identical to the catalytic subunit of bovine type 2A protein phosphatase. sit4 mutations in combination with suppressor mutations in RPB1 or RPB2 (sit1, sit4 or sit2, sit4) are lethal, suggesting an interaction between SIT4 and RNA polymerase II."
https://openalex.org/W2060497663,"Signal transducing guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins are heterotrimers with different alpha subunits that confer specificity for interactions with receptors and effectors. Eight to ten such G proteins couple a large number of receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters to at least eight different effectors. Although one G protein can interact with several receptors, a given G protein was thought to interact with but one effector. The recent finding that voltage-gated calcium channels are stimulated by purified Gs, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase, challenged this concept. However, purified Gs may have four distinct alpha-subunit polypeptides, produced by alternative splicing of messenger RNA. By using recombinant DNA techniques, three of the splice variants were synthesized in Escherichia coli and each variant was shown to stimulate both adenylyl cyclase and calcium channels. Thus, a single G protein alpha subunit may regulate more than one effector function."
https://openalex.org/W1664115270,"Nonenzymatic glycation by glucose (glucation) was compared with glycation by fructose (fructation). The rate and extent of protein-bound fluorescence generation upon fructation was about 10 times that upon glucation. In contrast, nonenzymatically glucated bovine serum albumin (BSA) released about twice as much formaldehyde upon periodate oxidation as did nonenzymatically fructated BSA. However, the rate of blocking of amino groups was similar in both proteins. Periodate oxidation of borohydride-reduced glycated BSA led to regeneration of amino groups with preservation of fluorescence. From the ratio between the decrease in formaldehyde-releasing ability and the regenerated amino groups, formaldehyde molar yields of 0.47 and 0.8 were computed for fructose- and glucose-derived Amadori groups, respectively. This is consistent with participation of both carbon 1 and carbon 3 in the Amadori rearrangement from fructose. The formaldehyde releasing ability of nonenzymatically fructated BSA attains asymptotic maximum values earlier than that of nonenzymatically glucated BSA. Thus, the higher rate of fluorescence generation in nonenzymatically fructated BSA could be explained by a faster conversion of its Amadori groups. Since fluorescence generation through the Maillard reaction has been correlated with long term complications of diabetes mellitus, the participation of nonenzymatic fructation in this pathological state deserves further exploration. This is especially relevant in tissues where fructose levels increase in diabetes as a result of the operation of the sorbitol pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1535336941,"As a means of gaining additional information on the topoisomerase-mediated cytotoxicity induced by a variety of antibacterial and antitumor compounds we have examined the interaction of the quinolone anti-bacterial agent, norfloxacin, with the bacterial topoisomerase, DNA gyrase. Membrane filtration and spin-column techniques were used to study the binding of [3H]norfloxacin to purified plasmid DNA, DNA gyrase, and complexes formed by adding gyrase to different forms of plasmid DNA. Consistent with previous results (Shen, L. L., and Pernet, A. G. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 82, 301â€“311) little [3H]norfloxacin binds to reconstituted gyrase, but significant levels of drug bind nonspecifically to relaxed DNA. However, when DNA and gyrase are incubated together additional norfloxacin binding sites are detectable. These complex-dependent sites are distinguishable from those sites involved in nonspecific DNA binding in that the complex-dependent sites are saturable and they retain bound norfloxacin after centrifuging the complex through a spin column. In addition, extent of binding is influenced by the topological state of DNA used to form the complex. The complex-dependent norfloxacin binding sites are likely involved in the inhibition of the enzyme since saturation of these sites occurs in the same norfloxacin concentration range as the inhibition of DNA supercoiling activity. Moreover, there is a close correlation of norfloxacin-induced DNA breakage with levels of norfloxacin bound to complexes of gyrase and relaxed DNA. These findings provide the first direct correlation of quinolone binding with inhibition of enzyme activity and induction of DNA breakage, and they suggest that the inhibition of DNA gyrase by norfloxacin occurs as a result of binding to a site which appears after the formation of a gyrase-DNA complex."
https://openalex.org/W1965209261,"Stretch-activated ion channels of animal, plant, bacterial, and fungal cells are implicated in mechanotransduction and osmoregulation. A new class of channel has now been described that is stretch-inactivated. These channels occur in neurons, where they coexist with stretch-activated channels. Both channels are potassium selective. The differing stretch sensitivities of the two channels minimize potassium conductance over an intermediate range of tension, with the consequence that, over this same range, voltage-gated calcium channels are most readily opened. Thus, by setting the relation between membrane tension and transmembrane calcium fluxes, stretch-sensitive potassium channels may participate in the control of calcium-dependent motility in differentiating, regenerating, or migrating neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1575340050,"The galactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-inhibitable adherence lectin of Entamoeba histolytica is a cell surface protein which mediates parasite adherence to human colonic mucus, colonic epithelial cells, and other target cells. The amebic lectin was purified in 100-micrograms quantities from detergent-solubilized trophozoites by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography. The adherence lectin was purified 500-fold as judged by radioimmunoassay. The nonreduced lectin had a molecular mass of 260 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and an isoelectric point of pH 6.2. The amebic lectin reduced with beta-mercaptoethanol consisted of 170- and 35-kDa subunits. Both subunits could be labeled on the cell surface with 125I, and both were metabolically labeled with [3H]glucosamine. The amino termini of the subunits had unique amino acid sequences, and polyclonal antisera to the heavy subunit did not cross-react with the light subunit. The yield of phenylthiohydantoin derivatives from the second and third positions in the sequence of the heavy and light subunits gave a molar ratio of one 170- to one 35-kDa subunit. Antibodies directed to the heavy subunit inhibited amebic adherence to Chinese hamster ovary cells by 100%, suggesting that the heavy subunit is predominantly responsible for mediating amebic adherence."
https://openalex.org/W1540116832,"Cassette site-directed mutagenesis was employed to generate mutations in the a subunit (uncB (a) gene) of F1F0ATP synthase. Using sequence homology with similar subunits of other F1F0ATP synthases as a guide, 20 mutations were targeted to a region of the a subunit thought to constitute part of the proton translocation mechanism. ATP-driven proton pumping activity is lost with the substitution of lys, ile, val, or glu for arginine 210. Substitution of val, leu, gln, or glu for asparagine 214 does not completely block proton conduction, however, replacement of asparagine 214 with histidine does reduce enzyme activity below that necessary for significant function. Two or three mutations were constructed in each of four nonpolar amino acids, leucine 207, leucine 211, alanine 217, and glycine 218. Certain specific mutations in these positions result in partial loss of F1F0ATP synthase activity, but only the substitution of arginine for alanine 217 reduces ATP-driven proton pumping activity to undetectable levels. It is concluded that of the six amino acids studied, only arginine 210 is an essential component of the proton translocation mechanism. Fractionation of cell-free extracts of a subunit mutation strains generally reveals normal amounts of F1 specifically bound to the particulate fraction. One possible exception is the arginine 210 to isoleucine mutation which results in somewhat elevated levels of free F1 detectable in the soluble fraction. For nearly all a subunit mutations, F1F0-mediated ATP hydrolysis activity remains sensitive to inhibition by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in spite of the fact that the mutations block proton translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1510836818,"Type VII collagen is the major structural protein of anchoring fibrils, which are believed to be critical for epidermal-dermal adhesion in the basement membrane zone of the skin. To elucidate possible mechanisms for the turnover of this protein, we examined the capacities of two proteases, human skin collagenase, which degrades interstitial collagens, and a protease with gelatinolytic and type IV collagenase activities, to cleave type VII collagen. At temperatures below the denaturation temperature, pepsin cleaves type VII collagen into products of approximately 95 and approximately 75 kDa. Human skin collagenase cleaved type VII collagen into two stable fragments of approximately 83 and approximately 80 kDa, and the type IV collagenase (gelatinase) produced a broad band of approximately 80 kDa as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cleavage of type VII collagen was linear with time and enzyme concentration for both enzymes. Although the Km values were similar for both enzymes, the catalytic rate of cleavage by type IV collagenase is much faster than by interstitial collagenase, and shows a greater rate of increase with increasing temperature. Sequence analysis of the cleavage products from both enzymes showed typical collagenous sequences, indicating a relaxation in the helical part of the type VII collagen molecule at physiological temperature which makes it susceptible to gelatinolytic degradation. Interstitial collagenase from both normal skin cells and cells from patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a severe hereditary blistering disease in which both an anchoring fibril defect and excessive production of collagenase can be observed, produced identical cleavage products from type VII collagen. These data suggest a pathophysiological link between increased enzyme levels and the observed decrease or absence of anchoring fibrils."
https://openalex.org/W1970005866,"The three-dimensional structures of full and empty capsids of HSV1 were determined by computer analysis of low dose cryo-electron images of ice embedded capsids. The full capsid structure is organized into outer, intermediate, and inner structural layers. The empty capsid structure has only one layer which is indistinguishable from the outer layer of the full capsids. This layer is arranged according to T = 16 icosahedral symmetry. The intermediate layer of full capsids appears to lie on a T = 4 icosahedral lattice. The genomic DNA is located inside the T = 4 shell and is the component of the innermost layer of the full capsids. The outer and intermediate layers interact in such a way that the channels along their icosahedral two-fold axis coincide and form a direct pathway between the DNA and the environment outside the capsid."
https://openalex.org/W1539511666,"Our previous work demonstrated that the inhibition of type I collagen synthesis by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH)2D3) in fetal rat calvaria and cultured rat osteosarcoma cells is accompanied by equivalent reduction in steady state levels of alpha 1(I) and alpha 2(I) collagen mRNA. To pursue the mechanism for this effect, we isolated and sequenced a 3.6-kilobase DNA fragment that contained the promoter for the rat alpha 1(I) collagen gene. This promoter fragment was fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and was introduced into ROS 17/2.8 cells by calcium phosphate co-precipitation. Expression of this construct was diminished by 1,25-(OH)2D3 to the same degree as the endogenous collagen gene in both transient expression assays and in permanently selected bone cells. However, a fibroblast cell line did not show a similar reduction in the activity of the transgene or the endogenous collagen gene. These experiments indicate that the alpha 1(I) promoter contains cis-active elements which are regulated by the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor in ROS 17/2.8 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1515800829,"The effect of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on macrophage receptors for tumor necrosis factor/cachectin (TNF-R) was studied. At equilibrium, iodinated recombinant human TNF alpha (rTNF alpha) bound to 1100 +/- 200 sites/cell on macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells with a Kd of 1.3 +/- 0.1 x 10(-9) M. Preexposure of RAW 264.7 cells to 10 ng/ml LPS for 1 h at 37 degrees C resulted in complete loss of cell surface TNF alpha binding sites. 50% loss ensued after 1 h with 0.6 ng/ml LPS, or after 15 min with 10 ng/ml LPS. Complete loss of TNF alpha binding sites occurred without change in numbers of complement receptor type 3. No decrease in TNF-R followed preexposure to LPS at 4 degrees C, nor could LPS displace 125I-rTNF alpha from its binding sites. Although TNF-R disappeared from the surface of intact macrophages following exposure to LPS, specific TNF alpha binding sites were unchanged in permeabilized macrophages, indicating that TNF-R were rapidly internalized. Conditioned media from LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells induced 30% down-regulation of TNF-R on macrophages from LPS-hyporesponsive mice (C3H/HeJ), suggesting that a soluble macrophage product may be responsible for a minor portion of the LPS effect. Additional evidence against endogenous TNF alpha being the major cause of TNF-R internalization was the rapid onset of the effect of LPS on TNF-R compared to the reported onset of TNF alpha production, the relatively high concentrations of exogenous rTNF alpha required to mimic the effect of LPS, and the inability of TNF alpha-neutralizing antibody to block the effect of LPS. LPS-induced down-regulation of TNF-R was complete or nearly complete not only in RAW 264.7 cells, but also in primary macrophages of both human and murine origin, was less marked in human endothelial cells, and was absent in human granulocytes and melanoma cells and mouse L929 cells. Thus, in situ, macrophages and some other host cells may be resistant to the actions of TNF alpha produced during endotoxinemia, because such cells may internalize their TNF-R in response to LPS before TNF alpha is produced."

https://openalex.org/W1541620413,"The metabolic inter-relationships between malarial parasites and their host erythrocytes are poorly understood. They have been investigated hitherto mostly by observing parasite behavior in erythrocyte variants, in metabolically altered erythrocytes, or in cell-free in vitro systems. We have studied the interconnection between the bioenergetic metabolism of host and parasite through compartment analysis of ATP in Plasmodium falciparum-infected human red blood cells, using Sendai virus-induced host cell lysis. ATP concentrations in host and parasite compartments were found to be equal. Inhibitors of mitochondrial activity reduce ATP levels to a similar extent in host and parasite compartments, although only the parasite contains functional mitochondria. It is shown that equalization of ATP levels is brought about by means of an adenylate translocator, probably localized at the parasite plasma membrane, in conjunction with adenylate kinase activity detected both in host and parasite compartments. The translocator is inhibited by compounds which are known to inhibit specifically the translocator of the inner membrane of mammalian mitochondria, with identical inhibitory constants. Addition of these inhibitors to intact infected cells causes a rapid depletion of ATP in the host compartment and a parallel increase in the parasite, suggesting that the parasite supplies ATP to its host cell rather than the reverse."
https://openalex.org/W1523098832,"Abstract Prostaglandin E (PGE) receptor is coupled to a pertussis toxin-insensitive GTP-binding protein in bovine adrenal medulla, but PGE receptor partially purified from bovine adrenal medulla was functionally reconstituted with Gi into phospholipid vesicles (Negishi, M., Ito, S., Yokohama, H., Hayashi, H., Katada, T., Ui, M., and Hayaishi, O. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6893-6900). We demonstrate here that PGE2 inhibited forskolin-induced accumulation of cAMP in cultured bovine chromaffin cells. In plasma membranes prepared from bovine adrenal medulla, PGE2 inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in a GTP-dependent manner. This inhibitory action of PGE2 was abolished by treatment of the membrane with pertussis toxin. Reconstitution of the membranes ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin with Gi purified from bovine brain restored the potency of PGE2 to inhibit the adenylate cyclase activity. Inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation by PGE2 was also abolished by exposure to the toxin in the cells, indicating that PGE receptors are coupled to Gi. In contrast, PGE2 stimulated the formation of inositol phosphates in chromaffin cells, but this effect was not affected by treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, suggesting that the PGE receptors are coupled to phosphoinositide metabolism via a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein. Both the inhibitory action of cAMP accumulation and stimulation of phosphoinositide metabolism were specific for PGE1 and PGE2, and the Scatchard plot analysis of PGE2 binding to the membrane showed a single high-affinity binding site (Kd = 2 nM). In bovine adrenal chromaffin cells PGE2 enhanced catecholamine release in the presence of ouabain by stimulation of phosphoinositide metabolism (Yokohama, H., Tanaka, T., Ito, S., Negishi, M., Hayashi, H., and Hayaishi, O. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1119-1122). We further examined the modulation of catecholamine release by PGE2 through its inhibitory coupling to the adenylate cyclase system. Prior exposure of chromaffin cells to forskolin or dibutyryl-cAMP reduced nicotine-stimulated catecholamine release, and PGE2 attenuated forskolin-induced inhibition of catecholamine release stimulated by nicotine, but not dibutyryl-cAMP-induced inhibition. In the absence of evidence that PGE receptor subtypes exist, these results suggest that the PGE receptor is coupled to two signal transduction systems leading to inhibition of cAMP accumulation via Gi and to production of inositol phosphates via a pertussis toxin-insensitive G-protein, both of which may modulate catecholamine release from bovine chromaffin cells."
https://openalex.org/W1531074822,"Abstract Binding of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) to its receptor on U937 cells results in rapid and TNF dose-dependent phosphorylation of a cytosolic protein with an apparent molecular mass of 26,000 kDa (p26) and an isoelectric point of 5.6. Half-maximal phosphorylation of p26 was achieved at concentrations of 1.8 ng/ml and was detectable within 20 s of TNF-alpha treatment. p26 is phosphorylated exclusively at serine residues. p26 phosphorylation occurs at 37 degrees C as well as at 14 degrees C, indicating that internalization of the TNF receptor is not required for serine kinase activation. Dephosphorylation of p26 starts 10 min after TNF-induced phosphorylation, suggesting a possible regulatory function of this cytosolic protein within the post-TNF receptor signaling system. p26 is also phosphorylated upon treatment with lymphotoxin. In contrast, both interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide fail to induce p26 phosphorylation. Whereas phosphorylated p26 was detected in the TNF-sensitive breast cancer cell line CRL1500, other TNF-responsive tumor cell lines investigated lacked enhanced phosphorylation of p26 in response to TNF, indicating that the 26-kDa phosphoprotein (pp26) may be a cell type-specific second messenger molecule involved in TNF signal transduction in some, but not all, target cells. p26 is also phosphorylated in a subclone of U937 (U937.C27) that responds to TNF-alpha with differentiation, yet is resistant to TNF-alpha-mediated growth inhibition. In contrast, p26 is not phosphorylated in another U937 derivative (U937.G3) that is resistant to both TNF-alpha-induced growth arrest and differentiation, suggesting that pp26 may play a role in the TNF signaling pathway linked to differentiation processes rather than to growth control."
https://openalex.org/W2045423010,"The biological effects of ras oncogene activation in B cells were studied by using amphotropic retroviral vectors to introduce H- or N-ras oncogenes into human B lymphoblasts immortalized by Epstein-Barr virus. Expression of both H- and N-ras oncogenes led to malignant transformation of these cells, as shown by clonogenicity in semisolid media and tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice. In addition, terminal differentiation into plasma cells was detectable as specific changes in morphology, immunoglobulin secretion, and cell surface antigen expression. This combined effect, promoting growth and differentiation in human lymphoblasts, represents a novel biological action of ras oncogenes and has implications for the pathogenesis of terminally differentiated B-lymphoid malignancies such as multiple myeloma."
https://openalex.org/W1604170645,"Abstract The putative roles for the second messenger, diacylglycerol, were investigated in intact platelets using a novel diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor, R 59 949, or (3-[2-[4-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methylene]-1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-2,3- dihydro-2-thioxo-4(1H)-quinazolinone). The compound inhibited the diacylglycerol kinase in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-8) to 10(-5) M) in isolated platelet membranes and in intact platelets. When platelets were stimulated with vasopressin in the presence of the compound, protein kinase C activity was markedly increased; the formation of inositol phosphates, the increase in intracellular Ca2+ and shape-change reaction were antagonized while the vasopressin-induced polyphosphoinositide synthesis was amplified, and this in a distinct inositolphospholipid pool. In the presence of R 59 949, vasopressin- as well as collagen-induced release reaction and aggregation was strongly increased, independently of the formation of arachidonate metabolites. It is concluded that diacylglycerol formed after receptor activation, likely by activating the protein kinase C, plays an important role in the propagation of platelet functional responses in casu aggregation and secretion and controls the termination of the primary receptor coupled responses."
https://openalex.org/W1587962830,"Abstract Muscarinic cholinergic agonists such as acetylcholine attenuate phosphorylation of phospholamban induced by agents that activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase. However, cAMP accumulation is variably affected or only slightly reduced; thus, the choline ester might produce effects in addition to inhibition of adenylate cyclase. We hypothesized that acetylcholine might regulate a phosphatase in mammalina myocardium. Exposure of Langendoff-perfused guinea pig ventricles to isoproterenol (10 nM) for 45 s increased phosphatase inhibitor-1 activity 2-fold. Co-administration of acetylcholine (100 nM) antagonized the effect of isoproterenol, and atropine (1 microM) blocked the effect of acetylcholine. Forskolin (1 microM) caused a 3-fold increase in inhibitor-1 activity, and acetylcholine markedly attenuated the effect of forskolin. However, acetylcholine did not lower cAMP levels in the same tissues. Both isoproterenol and forskolin reduced the type 1 phosphatase activity intrinsic to sarcoplasmic reticulum by 25-50%, using [32P]phosphorylase a or 32P-labeled membrane vesicles as a substrate for the phosphatase. Co-administration of acetylcholine markedly attenuated these effects of isoproterenol and forskolin. Acetylcholine alone caused a 50% increase in type 1 phosphatase activity. We concluded that inhibitor-1 and type 1 phosphatase can be regulated in intact cardiac muscle by agents that increase intracellular cAMP and by acetylcholine."
https://openalex.org/W1597632233,"Thrombomodulin is the endothelial cell cofactor for thrombin-catalyzed activation of protein C. Recently, we isolated a 10-kDa thrombin binding fragment, CB3, from the epidermal growth factor precursor homology domain (epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like regions) of thrombomodulin (Kurasawa, S., Stearns, D. J., Jackson, K.W., and Esmon, C.T. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 5993-5996). The CB3 fragment did not, however, support protein C activation. A 29-kDa fragment, called CB23, has now been isolated and corresponds to residues 310-486 in the EGF-like region of thrombomodulin. The CB23 fragment bound thrombin and accelerated thrombin-catalyzed protein C activation. With two separate preparations of CB23, the Km for protein C was 1.6 and 1.9 microM and the Kd for thrombin was 8.9 and 13.2 nM. The carboxyl terminus of CB23 and CB3 was identified by isolation and sequence analysis of a tryptic peptide from CB3. The sequence of this peptide corresponded to Asn457-Ser486, indicating that the carboxyl terminus of these fragments is 6 residues beyond the sixth EGF-like region of thrombomodulin. In addition, although CB3 cannot accelerate protein C activation, CB3 did inhibit the rate of thrombin-catalyzed fibrinopeptide release from fibrinogen. Thus, like native thrombomodulin, CB3 will alter thrombin's substrate specificity, but protein C activation requires additional information all of which can be provided by other regions of the EGF-like domain."
https://openalex.org/W1496619420,"We attempted to identify the kyotorphin receptor and the post receptor mechanisms mediated by GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins), using reconstitution techniques. The specific binding of [3H]kyotorphin in rat brain membranes was composed of high affinity (Kd = 0.34 nM) and low affinity (Kd = 9.07 nM) binding. As the high affinity binding disappeared in the presence of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) and MgCl2, we investigated the kyotorphin receptor-mediated changes in membrane G-protein activity by measuring low Km GTPase activity. Kyotorphin produced a stimulation of low Km GTPase, and this stimulation was antagonized by Leu-Arg, a synthetic dipeptide which showed a potent displacement of [3H]kyotorphin binding, yet in itself had no effect on the low Km GTPase. The kyotorphin stimulation of low Km GTPase was abolished by pretreating membranes with islet-activating protein, pertussis toxin, and was recovered by reconstitution with purified G-protein, Gi, but not with Go. Similar evidence of selective coupling of kyotorphin receptor to Gi was obtained with the phospholipase C assay. Kyotorphin-induced stimulation of phospholipase C was also abolished by islet-activating protein-treatment and recovered by reconstitution with Gi but not with Go. These findings indicate that specific high and low affinity kyotorphin receptors exist in the rat brain and that the kyotorphin receptor is functionally coupled to stimulation of phospholipase C, through Gi. This study provides the first evidence of a selective involvement of Gi in the receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C."

https://openalex.org/W1517088633,"Three phenotypically distinct subclones (SH-SY-5Y, SH-EP, SH-IN) of the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH were found to possess vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) precursor mRNA, release immunoreactive VIP, and express high-affinity VIP receptors coupled to adenylate cyclase. The apparent molecular mass for the receptor polypeptide, as determined by covalent cross-linking of 125I-VIP, was 49 kDa. After 2 days in culture, a concentration of immunoreactive VIP equivalent to the binding affinity of VIP to its receptor was found in the medium in two of these clones (SH-IN and SH-EP). Conditioned medium from SH-IN cells competitively displaced 125I-VIP binding and increased cAMP levels in SH-EP cells, indicating that all of the necessary components for a potential autocrine action of VIP exist in SK-N-SH cells. After numerous cell passages, the SH-EP subclone converted to a distinct phenotype in which VIP precursor mRNA and VIP immunoreactivity in the cell and medium were no longer detectable. In correlation, the VIP receptor number increased, and the EC50 for VIP stimulation of cAMP production shifted to a lower concentration. This points to the possibility that the continuous presence of endogenous VIP in earlier passage SH-EP cells causes a modification in VIP receptor number and cell responsiveness to VIP."
https://openalex.org/W1548306915,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cAMP-dependent phosphorylation plays an essential role at the start of the cell cycle. It has also recently been demonstrated that the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol is a requisite process for cell proliferation (Uno, I., Fukami, K., Kato, H., Takenawa, T., and Ishikawa, T. (1988) Nature 333, 188-190). To clarify the relationship between the cAMP- and inositol phospholipid-mediated signal transduction systems, alterations in the inositol phospholipid metabolism of cAMP mutants were examined. The incorporation of [32P]Pi into phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) was markedly reduced in ras2, which produces low levels of cAMP, and increased in bcy1, which produces cAMP-independent protein kinase. The incorporation of [32P]Pi into ATP and phosphatidylinositol (PI) was almost the same in wild type, ras1, ras2, and bcy1 yeast strains. The addition of exogenous cAMP to cyr1-2 caused a tremendous increase in [32P]Pi incorporation into PIP and PIP2 without any effect on incorporation into ATP and PI, suggesting that cAMP plays an important role in polyphosphoinositide synthesis. We therefore examined the activities of PI and PIP kinases, the enzymes that catalyze the sequential steps from PI to PIP2 via PIP. The activities of both kinases were found to be very low in the membranes of cry1-2 and ras2 but very high in the membranes of bcy1 and ras1 ras2 bcy1 strain cells. The addition of cAMP to cyr1-2 cells caused the activation of PI and PIP kinases. Furthermore, the treatment of membranes with cAMP or dibutyryl cAMP caused the activation of PI kinase in wild type, ras1, cry1-2, and ras2 strains, but not in bcy1 strain cells. The effect was most prominent in membranes from cyr1-2 and ras2 cells. These results show that cAMP-dependent phosphorylation enhances polyphosphoinositide synthesis through activation of PI and PIP kinase, an effect which may lead to the enhanced production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1555578760,"Incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in membranes isolated from rat brain was enhanced in a concentration-dependent manner by the GTP analogue guanosine 5'-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S). In contrast, neither the labeling of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in the same membranes nor PIP kinase activity in the soluble fraction were stimulated by GTP gamma S. Synthesis of [32P]PIP2 was not stimulated by GTP, GDP, GMP, or ATP; however, the stimulatory effects of GTP gamma S were antagonized by GTP, GDP, and guanosine 5'-O-thiodiphosphate (GDP beta S). The nucleotide-stimulated labeling of PIP2 was not due to protection of [gamma-32P] ATP from hydrolysis, activation of PIP2 hydrolysis by phospholipase C, or inhibition of PIP2 hydrolysis by its phosphomonoesterase. Therefore, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate kinase activity in brain membranes may be regulated by a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. This system may enhance the resynthesis of PIP2 following receptor-mediated activation of phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1485606583,"Abstract The structural features which influence the efficiency and site of cleavage by eukaryotic signal peptidase have not been fully defined. Human pre(delta pro) apolipoprotein A-II is a useful model system for such an analysis. We have recently shown that a panel of mutants which have amino acids of varying physical-chemical properties substituted for the -1 residue (Ala20) of its signal peptide exhibit cleavage at one of three potential sites or, in some cases, bidirected cleavage (Folz, R. J., Nothwehr, S. F., and Gordon, J. I. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2070-2078). In this present study, a subset of the pre(delta pro)Xaa20apoA-II mutants were used to identify conformational features, located COOH-terminal to the hydrophobic core domain, which regulate its cotranslational translocation and proteolytic processing. Proline residues were substituted at positions 13, 14, or 15 in ten of the original position 20 mutant preproteins in order to induce formation of a beta-turn structure at various positions upstream of the cleavage site. The effects of these mutations were assessed using an in vitro transcription/translation/microsome processing assay. Substitution of proline at position 13 resulted in a dramatic decrease in processing efficiency in all Xaa20 sequence contexts, while processing progressively increased when the proline was moved downstream to positions 14 and 15. Elongating the hydrophobic core of the Pro13 mutants by 1 residue reversed this effect. NH2-terminal sequence analysis of 34 co-translationally processed mutants revealed that the optimum distance between the site of proline introduction and the site of co-translational cleavage was 4-5 residues. However, this distance could be altered by the presence of certain amino acids at positions -1 and -3. The data suggest that several structural motifs NH2-terminal to residues -1 and -3 influence the location, site, and efficiency of cleavage by eukaryotic signal peptidase. These include specifically the length of the hydrophobic core, the location of beta-turns relative to the COOH terminus of this core domain, as well as the physical-chemical properties of amino acids at potential cleavage sites."

https://openalex.org/W1500733616,"Abstract Recombinant human lymphotoxin (rhLT) expressed in a mammalian cell line was purified and used to examine its receptors on the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U-937. rhLT was radioiodinated by the IODO-GEN method to a specific activity of 60 microCi/micrograms; the labeled protein was biologically active in the cytolytic assay, and displaceable binding to U-937 cells was observed. The specific binding reached a plateau within 10, 60, and 180 min at 37, 23, and 4 degrees C, respectively. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed the presence of a single class of high affinity receptors with an apparent Kd of 0.6 nM and a capacity of 33,000 +/- 7,000 binding sites/cell. The binding of 125I-rhLT to U-937 cells could be inhibited by excess unlabeled rhLT or recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (rhTNF), suggesting a common receptor for both molecules. As competitive inhibitor of the binding, rhTNF was equal in its potency to rhLT. Bacterial derived rhLT lacking carbohydrate was also found equipotent to cell line-derived rhLT for cell binding, indicating that carbohydrate plays no significant role in receptor interaction. Additionally, 125I-rhLT was covalently attached to the cell surface via a bifunctional cross-linking reagent, ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate), solubilized, and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The cross-linking of the receptor to rhLT revealed two distinct bands at approximate molecular masses of 100,000 and 120,000 daltons. Both bands were absent when unlabeled rhLT or rhTNF was used for competition, indicating the specificity. Affinity cross-linking of U-937 cells with 125I-rhTNF, however, provided only a single band with a molecular mass of about 100,000 daltons. These results suggest that the manner in which rhLT interacts with its receptor is perhaps somewhat different from that of rhTNF."
https://openalex.org/W1573381962,"A type 1 protein phosphatase from reticulocytes is shown to efficiently dephosphorylate the Mr = 68,000 phosphopeptide of the double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase that phosphorylates the Î± subunit of eukaryotic peptide initiation factor 2, eIF-2. The kinase, activated in the presence of double-stranded RNA with concomitant phosphorylation of the Mr = 68,000 peptide, causes inhibition of peptide initiation and thereby effects translational control of protein synthesis. The Mn2+-dependent phosphatase is classified as a type 1 enzyme in that it is inhibited by inhibitor 2 in nanomolar concentrations and appears to have a Mr = 35,000 catalytic subunit. Dephosphorylation of the Mr = 68,000 peptide by the phosphatase is directly associated with a loss in kinase activity which can be restored by incubation with double-stranded RNA in the presence of ATP. The results demonstrate that the eIF-2Î± kinase can undergo cyclic activation-inactivation that appears to be directly related to the phosphorylation state of the Mr = 68,000 peptide. They strongly support the previous conclusion that double-stranded RNA is required only for activation of the kinase and phosphorylation of the Mr = 68,000 peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1577793962,"Abstract Although the function of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein is generally understood, little is known of how the structure of this protein supports its mechanistic role in electron transfer in the cytochrome bc1 complex. To better understand the structural basis of iron-sulfur protein function, we have undertaken a mutational analysis of the gene encoding this protein and initially isolated five temperature-sensitive iron-sulfur protein mutants (Beckmann, J. D., Ljungdahl, P. O., and Trumpower, B. L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3713-3722). Each of the five ts-rip1- mutants exhibited pleiotropic effects. Although the mutant iron-sulfur proteins manifest several in vitro phenotypes in common, each exhibited unique characteristics. All of the ts-rip1- mutations resulted in membranes with decreased ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase activities and decreased thermostability compared to membranes containing wild type iron-sulfur protein. All of the mutations conferred slight but significant resistance to the respiratory inhibitor myxothiazol, and one mutant was hypersensitive to inhibition by UHDBT, a structural analog of ubiquinone. In addition, one of the mutations completely blocks post-translational processing of the iron-sulfur protein, leading to accumulation of pre-iron-sulfur protein in mitochondrial membranes at nonpermissive temperatures. Finally, a mutation 12-amino acid residues away from the carboxyl terminus (203S) results in an extremely unstable protein. This region of the protein may be essential in blocking of pre-iron-sulfur protein by cytoplasmic proteases as the protein is imported into the mitochondria, or may be a degradation signal, which tags the iron-sulfur protein for turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1640189357,"Abstract Protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) was shown to be present in renal brush border membranes. To evaluate the influence of protein kinase C activation on three apical transport systems, we studied the effect of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and of two diacylglycerol analogs, oleoylacetylglycerol and dioctanoylglycerol, on sodium-dependent uptakes of phosphate (Pi), L-alanine, and alpha-methyl-D-glucopyranoside (MGP), as well as on specific phlorizin binding, in cultured rabbit proximal tubular cells. PMA, at 100 ng/ml, decreased the Vmax of Pi and MGP uptake by 30 and 17%, respectively, but not that of alanine uptake. None of the Km values were affected. PMA also decreased the number of phlorizin binding sites by 40%. PMA-induced inhibition of Pi and MGP uptake was time- and concentration-dependent, was mimicked by oleoylacetylglycerol, dioctanoylglycerol, and the diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor R59022, and was reversed by the protein kinase C antagonist 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7). The effects of PMA persisted in the presence of amiloride and dimethyl amiloride, and were potentiated by Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Opening of tight junctions blunted subsequent PMA-induced decrease of MGP uptake, but not of Pi uptake. It is concluded that: (i) activation of protein kinase C does not affect similarly Na-Pi, Na-hexose, and Na-alanine cotransport; and (ii) different pathways are likely to be involved in the observed effects."
https://openalex.org/W1506112307,"In order to determine the concentration of pyrophosphate (PPi) and its subcellular distribution in Chara corallina, a new method to concentrate PPi from cell extracts was developed. PPi was extracted and concentrated as Ca2P2O7 under alkaline conditions. The amount of PPi in the precipitate was measured using an enzyme system containing pyrophosphate:fructose-6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.1.90) coupled to NADH oxidation in the presence of [ethylene-bis(oxyethylenenitrilo)]tetraacetic acid. The subcellular localization of PPi and inorganic phosphate (Pi) was studied using the intracellular perfusion technique. The relative volumes of the cytoplasm (6.4%) and the vacuole (93.6%) were determined by perfusing Lucifer Yellow CH into the vacuole and by assuming that the Lucifer Yellow CH dead space represented the cytoplasmic volume. The volume of the chloroplast layer was determined microscopically, and it was found that it occupied 10% of the Chara cytoplasm. PPi was present predominantly in the cytosol at a level of 193 microM, while it existed in the vacuole at a level of only 2.20 microM and less than 1 microM in chloroplasts. By contrast, Pi was distributed almost equally in the cytosol (12.0 mM), chloroplasts (16.2 mM), and the vacuole (6.70 mM). The electrochemical potential gradient across the tonoplast for H+ (delta mu H+ = -11.6 to -18.0 KJ/mol) was nearly equal to the free energy release from the hydrolysis of PPi in cytoplasm (delta Gpp = -18.9 KJ/mol), indicating that the H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase can work as a H+ pump in C. corallina."
https://openalex.org/W1631363513,"Transcription of the Bacillus subtilis pur operon is regulated independently by adenine and guanine levels in the growth medium. Transcription initiation is regulated by adenine, transcription attenuation by guanine (Ebbole, D. J., and Zalkin, H. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 8274-8287). A purC-lacZ fusion was constructed to monitor gene expression. Expression was reduced 11- and 18-fold by excess adenine and guanine, respectively. We have characterized the mechanism for the adenine-mediated control of transcription initiation. Deletions of DNA between nucleotides -193 and -37, relative to the start of transcription, resulted in high level constitutive expression and thus identified a control site for negative regulation. A candidate for a pur operon repressor protein was identified in a cell extract and was partially purified. This protein interacts specifically with an extended 5' flanking region of the pur operon that includes the control site identified by deletion analysis. DNase I footprinting defined the region of DNA-protein interaction between nucleotides -145 and -29. The protein-DNA interaction was not dependent on adenine, adenosine, or adenine nucleotides in vitro. These results suggest that a complex interaction of protein with an extended control region may repress transcription by blocking the -35 promoter site. This protein-DNA interaction is unlike that which regulates pur gene expression in Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1564886793,"In human hepatoma cell line Hep3B/T2, the human heat-shock-inducible gene hsp70 could be induced by insulin. The dose-dependent insulin effect correlates very well with the dissociation constant of the insulin receptor, indicating that the insulin effect is mediated by the insulin receptor. The expression of hsp70 gene was neither significantly induced by growth factors of epidermal and platelet-derived growth factors, nor by tumor promoter, calcium ionophore, cAMP, and glucocorticoids. These results indicate that the induction of expression of hsp70 gene by insulin is very specific and not cell cycle-related. Furthermore, the insulin-induced expression of hsp70 gene is transient, occurring specifically from 4 to 8 h after insulin addition."
https://openalex.org/W1774864641,"Abstract Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is a neuroendocrine precursor protein which is processed at paired basic amino acids in a tissue-specific manner. To study this phenomenon, a vaccinia virus recombinant, which directs the synthesis of mouse POMC (VV:mPOMC) was constructed and used to infect epithelial (BSC-40) and endocrine (Rin m5F) cell lines. Bona fide mPOMC was produced in both cell types and beta-endorphin immunoreactivity was secreted in a nonregulated manner from BSC-40 cells and in a regulated manner from Rin m5F cells. Although the precursor was not cleaved to smaller beta-MSH or beta-endorphin immunoreactive peptides in BSC-40 cell extracts, Rin m5F cells produced primarily authentic gamma-lipotropin and des-acetyl beta-endorphin. Furthermore, production of these peptides was restricted to the regulated secretory pathway in Rin m5F cells. Site-directed mutagenesis was then used to change the inefficiently recognized Lys-Lys potential cleavage site near the carboxyl terminus of beta-endorphin to Lys-Arg. Expression of the mutant precursor in Rin m5F cells resulted in the synthesis of both des-acetyl beta-endorphin and beta-endorphin."

https://openalex.org/W1524041805,"Abstract Insulin and various growth factors (epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and transforming growth factor alpha), which fail to modify the resting [Ca2+]i in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma and SKNBE human neuroblastoma cells when administered alone, became capable of inducing [Ca2+]i increases when administered a few (4-20) min after another agent, bradykinin. The latter peptide, working through a B2 receptor, caused hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides and a large, biphasic [Ca2+]i transient (an initial (1-2 min) spike, originated primarily from intracellular stores, followed by a steady-state elevation dependent on Ca2+ influx). Priming by bradykinin of the growth factor effects was quickly dissipated by the addition of a B2 blocker. Activation of other receptors coupled to polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis: muscarinic and purinergic (in PC12 and SKNBE cells); bombesin and vasopressin receptors (in Swiss 3T3 cells), was without effect in priming. Bradykinin-primed, growth factor-induced [Ca2+]i rises in PC12 cells appeared after a 20-30-s delay; they were relatively small, but persistent; their concentration dependence was similar to that of other effects of the factors; and they included both release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and stimulation of Ca2+ influx, preceded (in PC12 cells) by a transient increase of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis. Thus the effect of growth factors (possibly dependent on the tyrosine kinase activity of their receptors) consisted in the reinforcement of the transmembrane signaling at B2 receptors. This is the first direct demonstration of a [Ca2+]i rise induced by insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I, and of such an effect of EGF in cell types endowed with a small number of specific EGF receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1543265093,"Glucagon stimulates 14CO2 production from [1-14C] glycine by isolated rat hepatocytes. Maximal stimulation (70%) of decarboxylation of glycine by hepatocytes was achieved when the concentration of glucagon in the medium reached 10 nM; half-maximal stimulation occurred at a concentration of about 2 nM. A lag period of 10 min was observed before the stimulation could be measured. Inclusion of beta-hydroxybutyrate (10 mM) or acetoacetate (10 mM) did not affect the magnitude of stimulation suggesting that the effects of glucagon were independent of mitochondrial redox state. Glucagon did not affect either the concentration or specific activity of intracellular glycine, thus excluding the possibilities that altered concentration or specific activity of intracellular glycine contributes to the observed stimulation. The stimulation of decarboxylation of glycine by glucagon was further studied by monitoring 14CO2 production from [1-14C]glycine by mitochondria isolated from rats previously injected with glucagon. Glycine decarboxylation was significantly stimulated in the mitochondria isolated from the glucagon-injected rats. We suggest that glucagon is a major regulator of hepatic glycine metabolism through the glycine cleavage enzyme system and may be responsible for the increased hepatic glycine removal observed in animals fed high-protein diets."
https://openalex.org/W1605023499,"The repressor of bacteriophage P1, encoded by the c1 gene, is responsible for maintaining the P1 prophage in the lysogenic state. Previously, 11 c1 repressor binding sites or operators scattered over the whole genome of P1 have been found. From sequence analysis an asymmetric, 17-base pair consensus sequence, ATTGCTCTAATAAATTT, was derived. Using a synthetic 15-base-long oligodeoxyribonucleotide as operator probe, we have identified three additional operators. We have mapped the operators at the positions 21,68, and 88 of the P1 genome and determined their sequence. These operators are controlled by c1 because corresponding P1 DNA fragments (i) require c1 repressor in vivo in order to be clonable in multicopy plasmids, (ii) exhibit a c1-repressible promoter activity, (iii) are retarded by c1 repressor protein during electrophoresis, and (iv) contain the 17-base pair consensus sequence with one mismatch base each. Furthermore, we suggest that expression of the DNA adenine methylase (dam) encoded by P1 is controlled via Op68."
https://openalex.org/W1602395478,To study the import of proteins into mitochondria we developed a homologous in vitro system in which mitochondria and cell-free translation extract are both derived from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This system allows the synthesis of precursor proteins in the presence of isolated mitochondria and offers a means of analyzing yeast mutants defective in mitochondrial protein import. The in vitro import of an artificial precursor protein into yeast mitochondria in the presence of its substrate analog was analyzed subsequent to synthesis in either a yeast or rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation reaction. Results suggest that a component(s) present in the yeast cytosolic extract may interact with the precursor protein.

These DNAs comigrate with smaller supercoiled plasmids (7-8 kb), and their mobility is not a simple function of their size. The properties of the amplified DNAs were investigated to determine if an unusual structure accounts for the observed mobility of the amplified DNAs by OFAGE; however, their topological properties were similar to those of standard Escherichia coli plasmids. The migration of a series of supercoiled plasmids ranging in size from 6 to 91 kb was analyzed by OFAGE, and a triphasic pattern was observed. The mobilities of plasmids between 20 and 60 kb increase with size, whereas the migration of plasmids between 6 and 20 and 60 and 91 kb is inversely proportional to size. Like smaller plasmids, the large supercoiled DNAs show a pulse time-independent mobility by OFAGE. The mobility of amplified DNA from Leishmania is in accord with that of the plasmid markers. Therefore, it is primarily the size of the amplified extrachromosomal DNAs from Leishmania, rather than an unusual superhelical density or topological structure, that results in the previously unexplained migration pattern."

https://openalex.org/W1513888447,"Purification and characterization of Na+ channel protein from mammalian ventricular myocytes has heretofore been complicated by the low concentration of Na+ channels and by the finding that mammalian ventricles contain both tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive channels (TSC), with high affinity for saxitoxin (STX), and TTX-insensitive channels (TIC), with low affinity for STX. Most (perhaps all) of the sodium current for myocardial cell action potentials is carried by TIC. Most, if not all, of the cardiac TSC reside in nerves innervating the heart. To isolate TIC in sufficient quantity for further study, we prepared t-tubular sarcolemmal vesicles from large (sheep) hearts with techniques designated to minimize contamination from nerve plasmalemma. Discontinuous sucrose density gradient centrifugation of these membranes produced membrane vesicles, some of which contained no detectable TSC (range 94-100% TIC, or 0-6% TSC), at a concentration of 200-1500 fmol total sites/mg protein, with yields of 4.0-25.0 mg protein/100 g starting material (ventricle). TTX-insensitive STX-binding sites were solubilized from the membranes by 1% digitonin (and with less stability by Triton X-100). The equilibrium binding constant and dissociation rate coefficient for STX binding to the digitonin-solubilized sites were similar to those of the binding sites for the unsolubilized membranes. Unlabeled TTX competed with [3H]STX for the site with 14 times less affinity than did unlabeled STX. Digitonin-solubilized sites had a half-life for STX binding of about 24 h. Binding could be further stabilized by addition of Mg2+ or Ca2+ and exogenous phospholipid."
