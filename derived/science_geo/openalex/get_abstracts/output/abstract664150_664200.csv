https://openalex.org/W3109631583,"Studies have documented dysbiosis in the gut mycobiome in people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, it is not known whether dysbiosis in the gut mycobiome of T2DM patients would be reflected in people with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and if so, is the observed mycobiome dysbiosis similar in people with T2DM and DR. Gut mycobiomes were generated from healthy controls (HC), people with T2DM and people with DR through Illumina sequencing of ITS2 region. Data were analysed using QIIME and R software. Dysbiotic changes were observed in people with T2DM and DR compared to HC at the phyla and genera level. Mycobiomes of HC, T2DM and DR could be discriminated by heat map analysis, Beta diversity analysis and LEfSE analysis. Spearman correlation of fungal genera indicated more negative correlation in HC compared to T2DM and DR mycobiomes. This study demonstrates dysbiosis in the gut mycobiomes in people with T2DM and DR compared to HC. These differences were significant both at the phyla and genera level between people with T2DM and DR as well. Such studies on mycobiomes may provide new insights and directions to identification of specific fungi associated with T2DM and DR and help developing novel therapies for Diabetes Mellitus and DR."
https://openalex.org/W3108929724,"With the spread of COVID-19, more countries now recommend their citizens to wear facemasks in public. The uptake of facemasks, however, remains far from universal in countries where this practice lacks cultural roots. In this paper, we aim to identify the barriers to mask-wearing in Spain, a country with no mask-wearing culture. We conduct one of the first nationally representative surveys (n = 4,000) about this unprecedented public health emergency and identify the profile of citizens who are more resistant to face-masking: young, educated, unconcerned with being infected, and with an introverted personality. Our results further indicate a positive correlation between a social norm of mask-wearing and mask uptake and demonstrate that uptake of facemasks is especially high among the elderly living in localities where mask-wearing behavior is popular. These results are robust when controlling for respondents’ demographics, time spent at home, and occupation fixed effects. Our findings can be useful for policymakers to devise effective programs for improving public compliance."
https://openalex.org/W3108284606,"This study is the first report on the biosynthesized iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) which mediate in-vitro callus induction and shoot regeneration in economically important recalcitrant chickpea crop ( Cicer arietinum L.). Here, we used leaf extract of Cymbopogon jwarancusa for the synthesis of IONPs in order to achieve a better biocompatibility. The bioactive compounds in C . jwarancusa leaf extract served as both reducing and capping agents in the fabrication process of IONPs. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) revealed rods like surface morphology of IONPs with an average diameter of 50±0.2 nm. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) depicted formation of pure IONPs with 69.84% Fe and 30.16% O 2 . X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) validate the crystalline structure, chemical analysis detect the presence of various biomolecular fingerprints in the as synthesized IONPs. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy depicts activity of IONPs under visible light. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) displayed thermal loss of organic capping around 500°C and confirmed their stabilization. The biosynthesized IONPs revealed promising results in callus induction, shoot regeneration and root induction of chickpea plants. Both chickpea varieties Punjab-Noor 09 and Bittle-98 explants, Embryo axes (EA) and Embryo axes plus adjacent part of cotyledon (EXC) demonstrated dose-dependent response. Among all explants, EXC of Punjab-Noor variety showed the highest callogenesis (96%) and shoot regeneration frequency (88%), while root induction frequency was also increased to 83%. Iron content was quantified in regenerated chickpea varieties through inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. The quantity of iron is significantly increased in Punjab-Noor regenerated plants (4.88 mg/g) as compare to control treated plants (2.42 mg/g). We found that IONPs enhance chickpea growth pattern and keep regenerated plantlets infection free by providing an optimum environment for rapid growth and development. Thus, IONPs synthesized through green process can be utilized in tissue culture studies in other important recalcitrant legumes crops."
https://openalex.org/W3110464282,"Although the integration of social determinants of health (SDH) screening and referral programs in clinical settings has rapidly grown, the voice and experience of participants within SDH programs has not been well understood in program evaluations. To qualitatively evaluate a comprehensive SDH screening and referral program based in an academic primary care setting, we conducted a qualitative analysis of a semi-structured, focus group interview of 7 caregivers. We performed inductive coding representing emerging ideas from each transcript using focus group transcripts from families who participated in the SDH screening and referral program. A thematic model was created describing caregivers’ experiences with respect to screening, intake, and referral phases of the program. Caregivers reported satisfaction with structural and process-related components of screening, intake, and referral. They expressed a preference for trained patient navigators over physicians for screening and intake for they were perceived to have time to prioritize caregivers’ social needs. Caregivers reported disappointment with legal services screening, intake, and referral, citing lack of timely contact from the legal resource team and prematurity of provided legal resources. Overall, caregivers recommend the program, citing that the program provided social support, an environment where expression is encouraged, motivation to address their own health needs, and a convenient location. Overall, caregivers would recommend the program because they feel socially supported. The use of trained patient navigators appears to be instrumental to the successful implementation of the program in clinics, for navigators can provide caregivers with the appropriate time and personal attention they need to complete the survey and discuss their needs. Streamlining the referral process for evaluation of health-harming needs by the medical legal partnership was highlighted as an area for improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3108302220,"Tobacco is well known as a risk factor for early morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the relative risk of mortality and the effects of smoking vary among the countries. Indonesia, as one of the world’s largest market for smoking tobacco, is significantly affected by tobacco-related illness. Previous research has shown that smoking causes several diseases, including stroke, neoplasm and coronary heart disease. There has to date been no research on the hazard risk of smoking for all-cause mortality in Indonesia. This study aimed to identify the association between smoking and all-cause mortality rates in Indonesia. Information from a total of 3,353 respondents aged 40 years and older was collected in this study. The data were taken from the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) Wave 4 (2007) to collect personal information and determine smoking status and from Wave 5 (2015) to collect information about deaths. Current smokers make up 40.3% of Indonesia’s population. Current smokers were more likely to have a higher risk of all-cause death (hazard ratio = 1.48, 95% confidence interval = 1.11 to 1.98) than non-current smokers. The number of smokers in Indonesia remains high and is expected to increase gradually every year. A firm government policy is needed to reduce the number of smokers in Indonesia which would automatically reduce the health problem of smoking-related illness in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3108770655,"Salt stress affects the metabolic homeostasis of medicinal plants. However, medicinal plants are sessile organisms that cannot escape from salt stress. They acclimatize themselves to the stress by reprogramming their metabolic pathways. Lonicerae Japonicae Flos (LJF) with strong antioxidant activity is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine, tea, and beverage. Nevertheless, the variation of integrated metabolites in LJF under different salt stresses remains unclear. In this study, High Performance Liquid Chromatography tandem triple time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC- triple TOF-MS/MS) coupled with multivariate statistical analysis was applied to comparatively investigate the metabolites changes in LJF under different salt stress (0, 100, 200, 300 mM NaCl). Total 47 differential metabolites were screened from 79 metabolites identified in LJF under different salt stress. Low salt-treated group (100 mM NaCl) appeared to be the best group in terms of relative contents (peak areas) of the wide variety in bioactive components. Additionally, the phenylpropanoid pathway, monoterpenoid biosynthesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and alkaloid biosynthesis were disturbed in all salt-stress LJF. The results showed that LJF metabolisms were dramatically induced under salt stress and the quality of LJF was better under low salt stress. The study provides novel insights into the quality assessment of LJF under salt stress and a beneficial framework of knowledge applied to improvement the medicinal value of LJF."
https://openalex.org/W3109880004,"Objective To investigate the clinical effects of IRT5 probiotics in the environmental dry eye model. Methods Eight week old male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into two groups; control group (n = 16) received oral gavage of 300 μL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone once daily, IRT5 group (n = 9) received oral gavage of 1 x 10 9 CFU IRT5 probiotics powder in 300 μL PBS once daily, both groups for 11 to 12 days. Simultaneously, all mice underwent dry eye induction. Tear secretion, corneal staining and conjunctival goblet cell density were evaluated. Quantative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for inflammation-related markers was performed. 16S ribosomal RNA of fecal microbiome was analyzed and compositional difference, alpha and beta diversities were assessed. Results There was no difference in NEI score but significant increase in tear secretion was observed in IRT5 group (p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in goblet cell density between groups. Quantative RT-PCR of cornea and conjunctiva revealed increased TNF-α expression in IRT5 group (p &lt; 0.001) whereas other markers did not significantly differ from control. IRT5 group had significantly increased species diversity by Shannon index (p = 0.041). Beta diversity of genus by UniFrac principle coordinates analysis showed significant distance between groups (p = 0.001). Compositional differences between groups were observed and some were significantly associated with tear secretion. Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed Christensenellaceae (p = 0.009), Lactobacillus Helveticus group (p = 0.002) and PAC001797_s (p = 0.011) to strongly influence tear secretion. Conclusion In experimental dry eye model, IRT5 probiotics treatment partially improves experimental dry eye by increasing tear secretion which was associated with and influenced by the change in intestinal microbiome. Also, intestinal microbiome may affect the lacrimal gland through a different mechanism other than regulating inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3106934890,"Introduction Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is a strong independent predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD mortality. However, little is known in regards to how CRF has trended in apparently healthy adults over the past several decades. Purpose To analyze trends in CRF and CVD risk factors over the last 50 years in a population of apparently healthy adult men and women. Methods Participants were 4,214 apparently healthy adults (2,390 men and 1,824 women) from the B all State A dult Fitness L ongitudinal L ifestyle ST udy (BALL ST) that performed maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing between 1970–2019 for the assessment of CRF defined as VO 2max (ml/kg/min). Participants were self-referred either to a community-based exercise program, fitness testing, or were research subjects in exercise related studies and were placed into groups by decade based on testing date. Results CRF showed a general trend to decline (P&lt;0.05) from the 1970s to the 2000s with an increase (P&lt;0.05) from the 2000s to the 2010s for both men and women. This pattern persisted for age and sex-adjusted CRF level, determined by Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise: A National Data Base (FRIEND). For both women and men, CRF across the decades was associated (P&lt;0.05) with the prevalence of physical inactivity, smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia and hypertension, and with diabetes in men only. Conclusion CRF declined from 1970 through the 2000s in a cohort of apparently healthy men and women which was associated with worsening CVD risk profiles. However, the decline in CRF was attenuated over the past decade which may have a positive impact on future CVD in the population. Promoting physical activity to increase CRF should be a primary aspect of CVD prevention programs."
https://openalex.org/W3108295634,"A multipotent cell population co-expressing a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor scleraxis (Scx) and SRY-box 9 (Sox9) has been shown to contribute to the establishment of entheses (tendon attachment sites) during mouse embryonic development. The present study aimed to investigate the involvement of Scx + /Sox9 + cells in the postnatal formation of fibrocartilaginous entheses and in the healing process after injury, using ScxGFP transgenic mice. We demonstrate that Scx + /Sox9 + cells are localized in layers at the insertion site during the postnatal formation of fibrocartilaginous entheses of supraspinatus tendon until postnatal 3 weeks. Further, these cells were rarely seen at postnatal 6 weeks, when mature fibrocartilaginous entheses were formed. Furthermore, we investigated the involvement of Scx + /Sox9 + cells in the healing process after supraspinatus tendon enthesis injury, comparing the responses of 20- and 3-week-old mice. In the healing process of 20-week-old mice with disorganized fibrovascular tissue in response to injury, a small number of Scx + /Sox9 + cells transiently appeared from 1 week after injury, but they were rarely seen at 4 weeks after injury. Meanwhile, in 3-week-old mice, a thin layer of fibrocartilaginous tissue with calcification was formed at healing enthesis at 4 weeks after injury. From 1 to 2 weeks after injury, more Scx + /Sox9 + cells, widely distributed at the injured site, were seen compared with the 20-week-old mice. At 4 weeks after injury, these cells were located near the surface of the recreated fibrocartilaginous layer. This spatiotemporal localization pattern of Scx + /Sox9 + cells at the injured enthesis in our 3-week-old mouse model was similar to that in postnatal fibrocartilaginous enthesis formation. These findings indicate that Scx + /Sox9 + cells may have a role as entheseal progenitor-like cells during postnatal maturation of fibrocartilaginous entheses and healing after injury in a manner similar to that seen in embryonic development."
https://openalex.org/W3107120273,"Commercial buildings account for one third of the total electricity consumption in the United States and a significant amount of this energy is wasted. Therefore, there is a need for “virtual” energy audits, to identify energy inefficiencies and their associated savings opportunities using methods that can be non-intrusive and automated for application to large populations of buildings. Here we demonstrate virtual energy audits applied to large populations of buildings’ time-series smart-meter data using a systematic approach and a fully automated Building Energy Analytics (BEA) Pipeline that unifies, cleans, stores and analyzes building energy datasets in a non-relational data warehouse for efficient insights and results. This BEA pipeline is based on a custom compute job scheduler for a high performance computing cluster to enable parallel processing of Slurm jobs. Within the analytics pipeline, we introduced a data qualification tool that enhances data quality by fixing common errors, while also detecting abnormalities in a building’s daily operation using hierarchical clustering. We analyze the HVAC scheduling of a population of 816 buildings, using this analytics pipeline, as part of a cross-sectional study. With our approach, this sample of 816 buildings is improved in data quality and is efficiently analyzed in 34 minutes, which is 85 times faster than the time taken by a sequential processing. The analytical results for the HVAC operational hours of these buildings show that among 10 building use types, food sales buildings with 17.75 hours of daily HVAC cooling operation are decent targets for HVAC savings. Overall, this analytics pipeline enables the identification of statistically significant results from population based studies of large numbers of building energy time-series datasets with robust results. These types of BEA studies can explore numerous factors impacting building energy efficiency and virtual building energy audits. This approach enables a new generation of data-driven buildings energy analysis at scale."
https://openalex.org/W3108211897,"We previously reported that feeding Se-biofortified alfalfa hay to weaned beef calves in a preconditioning program decreases morbidity and mortality during the feedlot period. To understand the mode of action by which supranutritional Se supplementation supports calf health, we examined the effect of agronomic Se-biofortification on nasal microbiome and fecal parasites. Recently weaned Angus-cross beef calves (n = 30) were randomly assigned to two groups and fed an alfalfa hay-based diet for 9 weeks in a preconditioning program. Alfalfa hay was harvested from fields fertilized with sodium selenate at a rate of 0 or 90 g Se/ha. Calculated Se intake from dietary sources was 1.09 and 27.45 mg Se/calf per day for calves consuming alfalfa hay with Se concentrations of 0.06 and 3.47 mg Se/kg dry matter, respectively. Feeding Se-biofortified alfalfa hay for 9 weeks was effective at increasing whole-blood Se concentrations (556 ± 11 vs 140 ± 11 ng/mL; P &lt; 0.001) and increasing body weight ( P Treatment , = 0.03) in weaned beef calves. Slaughter yield grades were higher for calves that had been fed Se-enriched alfalfa hay during the preconditioning period ( P Treatment = 0.008). No significant differences were observed in fecal parasite load, which remained low. The nasal microbiome and microbiota diversity within calves and across calves expanded from weaning (week 0) to the feedlot period (week 12), which was promoted by feeding Se-biofortified alfalfa hay. Especially concerning was the expansion of nasal Mycoplasmataceae in the feedlot, which reached over 50% of the total microbiota in some calves. In conclusion, we identified dietary Se-biofortified alfalfa hay as a potential promoter of nasal microbiome genome and microbiota diversity, which may explain in part high-Se benefits for prevention of bovine respiratory disease complex in beef calves."
https://openalex.org/W3107377651,"The ability of muscles to produce force depends, among others, on their anatomical features and it is altered by ageing-associated weakening. However, a clear characterisation of these features, highly relevant for older individuals, is still lacking. This study hence aimed at characterising muscle volume, length, and physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and their variability, between body sides and between individuals, in a group of post-menopausal women. Lower-limb magnetic resonance images were acquired from eleven participants (69 (7) y. o., 66.9 (7.7) kg, 159 (3) cm). Twenty-three muscles were manually segmented from the images and muscle volume, length and PCSA were calculated from this dataset. Personalised maximal isometric force was then calculated using the latter information. The percentage difference between the muscles of the two lower limbs was up to 89% and 22% for volume and length, respectively, and up to 84% for PCSA, with no recognisable pattern associated with limb dominance. Between-subject coefficients of variation reached 36% and 13% for muscle volume and length, respectively. Generally, muscle parameters were similar to previous literature, but volumes were smaller than those from in-vivo young adults and slightly higher than ex-vivo ones. Maximal isometric force was found to be on average smaller than those obtained from estimates based on linear scaling of ex-vivo -based literature values. In conclusion, this study quantified for the first time anatomical asymmetry of lower-limb muscles in older women, suggesting that symmetry should not be assumed in this population. Furthermore, we showed that a scaling approach, widely used in musculoskeletal modelling, leads to an overestimation of the maximal isometric force for most muscles. This heavily questions the validity of this approach for older populations. As a solution, the unique dataset of muscle segmentation made available with this paper could support the development of alternative population-based scaling approaches, together with that of automatic tools for muscle segmentation."
https://openalex.org/W3109922611,"One important concern around the spread of respiratory infectious diseases has been the contribution of public transportation, a space where people are in close contact with one another and with high-use surfaces. While disease clearly spreads along transportation routes, there is limited evidence about whether public transportation use itself is associated with the overall prevalence of contagious respiratory illnesses at the local level. We examine the extent of the association between public transportation and influenza mortality, a proxy for disease prevalence, using city-level data on influenza and pneumonia mortality and public transit use from 121 large cities in the United States (US) between 2006 and 2015. We find no evidence of a positive relationship between city-level transit ridership and influenza/pneumonia mortality rates, suggesting that population level rates of transit use are not a singularly important factor in the transmission of influenza."
https://openalex.org/W3107894207,"Thermal degradation of sugars and amino acids, and depolymerization of macromolecules such as starch, proteins and fibre occasioned by high-temperature short-time extrusion cooking modify the physicochemical and functional properties of raw materials. High-temperature short-time extrusion cooking holds promise for the expanded use of non-conventional ingredients as food/feed due to its practicality, increased productivity and efficiency, and ability to retain thermally degradable nutrients during cooking. However, little is known about the effect of the high-temperature short-time extrusion cooking process on the physicochemical properties and starch digestibility of lesser-known grain legumes such as African yam beans ( Sphenostylis stenocarpa ), Pigeon pea ( Cajanus cajan ), and Bambara peanut ( Vigna subterranean ). In this study, we investigate the effect of high-temperature short-time extrusion cooking and extrusion cooking temperature; low (100°C) vs high (140°C) temperatures in a single screw extruder, on hydration characteristics, viscoamylolytic properties, in vitro starch digestibility and digestion kinetics of these grain legumes. We show that water holding capacity and swelling power increased (p &lt; 0.05) with increasing extrusion temperature for Sphenostylis stenocarpa and Vigna subterranean but not Cajanus cajan extrudates. Significant effects of extrusion cooking (i.e unextruded vs 100°C and unextruded vs 140°C) and extrusion temperatures (i.e. 100°C vs 140°C) were observed in peak, trough, final and setback viscosities of all extrudates. Starch digestibility and digestion characteristics were modified with increase in extrusion temperature, however, no effect of extrusion temperatures (i.e. 100°C vs 140°C) on starch digestion kinetics was observed for Sphenostylis stenocarpa and Vigna subterranean except for hydrolysis index (34.77 vs 40.77%). Nutritional and physiological implications of extruded grain legumes in monogastric animal feeding were also highlighted. The Information presented herein will influence expanded use of extruded grain legumes as feed ingredients for intensive monogastric animal feeding."
https://openalex.org/W3109604817,"Background Breastfeeding is recommended by many organisations, but feeding choices can take on complexity against a backdrop of a transmissible infection risk. The aim of this synthesis is to explore what is known about the values and preferences of pregnant women, mothers, family members and health practitioners, policy makers and providers (midwives) concerning feeding when there is a risk of Mother-to-Child transmission [MTCT] of an infectious disease (other than HIV/AIDS) to infants (0–2 years of age). Methods A qualitative evidence synthesis and GRADE CERQual assessment of relevant studies of values and preferences regarding infant feeding options in the context of non-HIV MTCT risk. Results The synthesis included eight qualitative studies. Four studies focussed on human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1), three studies on Ebola, and one study on influenza vaccination. Mothers reported feeling sadness and guilt at not breastfeeding, while recognising that it was important for the health of their baby not to breastfeed. Mothers were reportedly appreciative of the provision of appropriate facilities, and the advice of those health professionals who knew about the diseases, but felt other professionals lacked knowledge about the transmission risk of conditions such as HTLV-1. All groups expressed concerns about social perceptions of not breastfeeding, as well as the alternatives. The evidence was coherent and relevant, but there were serious concerns about adequacy and methodological limitations, such as potential social desirability bias in some studies. Conclusions This synthesis describes the reported values and preferences of pregnant women, mothers, and others concerning feeding when there is a risk of Mother-to-Child transmission (MTCT) of an infectious disease (other than HIV/AIDS) to an infant when breastfeeding. However, the evidence in the peer-reviewed literature is limited both in quality and quantity."
https://openalex.org/W3106758662,"Aim This study investigated the risk of osteoporosis or bone fractures (vertebrae, hip and others) in hysterectomized women in Taiwan. Materials and methods This is a retrospective population-based cohort study from 2000 to 2013. Women aged ≥30 years who underwent hysterectomy between 2000 and 2012 were included in this study. The comparison group was randomly selected from the database with a 1:4 matching with age and index year. Incidence rate and hazard ratios of osteoporosis and bone fracture between hysterectomized women and the comparison group were calculated. Cox proportional hazard regressions were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results We identified 9,189 hysterectomized women and 33,942 age-matched women without a hysterectomy. All women were followed for a median time of about 7 years. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of subsequent osteoporosis or bone fracture was higher in the hysterectomy women (2.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.09–2.44) than in the comparison group. In the subgroup analysis, oophorectomy and estrogen therapy increase the risk of osteoporosis or fracture in both groups. Regarding the fracture site, the aHR of vertebral fracture (4.92, 95% CI = 3.78–6.40) was higher in the hysterectomized women than in the comparison group. As follow-up time increasing, the aHR of vertebral fracture in hysterectomized women were 4.33 (95% CI = 2.99–6.28), 3.89 (95% CI = 2.60–5.82) and 5.42 (95% CI = 2.66–11.01) for &lt;5, 5–9 and ≥9 years of follow-up, respectively. Conclusions In conclusion, we found that hysterectomized women might be associated with increased risks of developing osteoporosis or bone fracture."

In order to assess the ecological impacts of these highly abundant invaders, we developed a multivariate auto-regressive (MAR) model of food web dynamics based upon a 12-year time-series of plankton community and environmental data from the Columbia River. Our model results indicate that plankton communities in the lower Columbia River are strongly impacted by the copepod P . forbesi at multiple trophic levels. We observed different ecological effects across different life stages of P . forbesi , with nauplii negatively impacting ciliates and autotrophs, and copepodite stages negatively impacting Daphnia and cyclopoid copepods. Although juvenile C . fluminea were highly abundant in the summer and autumn of each year, our best fit MAR model did not show significant C . fluminea impacts. Our results illustrate the strong ecological impact that some zooplankton invaders may cause within rivers and estuarine systems, and highlight the need for further research on the feeding ecology of the planktonic life-stage of C . fluminea . Overall, our study demonstrates the manner in which long-term, high resolution data sets can be used to better understand the ecological impacts of invasive species among complex and highly dynamic communities."
https://openalex.org/W3108636026,"Heavy losses by dark leaf spot disease in oilseed Brassica have incited research towards identifying sources of genetic tolerance against causal pathogen, Alternaria brassicicola . Several morpho-molecular parameters were evaluated to test the performance of field mustard and rapeseed genotypes under artificial inoculation with this pathogen. During Brassica - Alternaria interaction, physio-biochemical defense response was witnessed in tolerant genotypes. Two tolerant genotypes (one for field mustard and one for rapeseed), i.e., EC250407 and EC1494 were identified. However, necrotic lesions were more prominent in susceptible genotypes with minimum chlorophyll (chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b and total chlorophyll) and carotenoids contents. Contrary to photosynthetic pigments, increase in total soluble protein (TSP) contents was observed with disease progression in susceptible genotypes. Tolerant genotypes of field mustard and rapeseed displayed remarkable increase in the activities of redox enzyme in infected leaves with least yield loss (6.47% and 5.74%) and disease severity index (DSI) of 2.9 and 2.1, respectively. However, yield/plant showed close association with other morpho-yield parameters, photosynthetic pigments and redox enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD)) activities except silique length and TSP. Based on the results of morpho-biochemical analyses, redox enzymes and morphological parameters; their interplay is proposed to determine the tolerance outcome of the Brassica - A . brassicicola interaction."
https://openalex.org/W3107008065,"Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only disease-modifying treatment with evidence for sustained efficacy. However, it is poorly developed compared to symptomatic drugs. The main reasons come from treatment duration implying monthly injections during 3 to 5 years or daily sublingual use, and the risk of allergic side-effects. To become a more attractive alternative to lifelong symptomatic drug use, improvements to AIT are needed. Among the most promising new immunotherapy strategies is the use of bioparticles for the presentation of target antigen to the immune system as they can elicit strong T cell and B cell immune responses. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a specific class of bioparticles in which the structural and immunogenic constituents are from viral origin. However, VLPs are ill-suited for use in AIT as their antigenicity is linked to structure. Recently, synthetic biology has been used to produce artificial modular bioparticles, in which supramolecular assemblies are made of elements from heterogeneous biological sources promoting the design and use of in vivo-assembling enveloped bioparticles for viral and non-viral antigens presentation. We have used a coiled-coil hybrid assembly for the design of an enveloped bioparticle (eBP) that present trimers of the Der p 2 allergen at its surface, This bioparticle was produced as recombinant and in vivo assembled eBPs in plant. This allergen biotherapeutic was used to demonstrate i) the capacity of plants to produce synthetic supramolecular allergen bioparticles, and ii) the immunomodulatory potential of naturally-assembled allergen bioparticles. Our results show that allergens exposed on eBPs induced a very strong IgG response consisting predominantly of IgG2a in favor of the TH1 response. Finally, our results demonstrate that rDer p 2 present on the surface of BPs show a very limited potential to stimulate the basophil degranulation of patient allergic to this allergen which is predictive of a high safety potential."
https://openalex.org/W3107270912,"Introduction The aim of this study was to rank capabilities and suggest a relevant set of capabilities for the Swedish context to inform the development of capability-adjusted life years (CALYs). CALYs is a quality of life measure for policy making based on the capability approach by Amartya Sen. Materials and methods A Swedish governmental review proposed the following 10 relevant capabilities: time, financial situation, mental/physical health, political resources, knowledge, living environment, occupation, social relations, security, and housing. Researchers in health-related disciplines from 5 universities ranked these capabilities from 1 to 10 (most to least important) in a web-based cross-sectional survey; 115 of 171 responses were eligible. Results Health, social relations, and financial situation were deemed most important. Stratification by gender, research field, and age group revealed few differences. We found that it was possible to rank capabilities and that health, social relations, and financial situation were ranked highest by a non-representative sample of researchers and doctoral students from health-related disciplines at five Swedish universities. Conclusions The revealed ranking is dependent on the metric and must be further explored. The findings support continued development of CALYs for monitoring and evaluating outcomes in public health and social-welfare interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3108051867,"Dyslipidemias and lipid-accumulation disorders are common in captive parrots, in particular in Quaker parrots. Currently available diagnostic tests only measure a fraction of blood lipids and have overall problematic cross-species applicability. Comprehensively analyzing lipids in the plasma of parrots is the first step to better understand their lipid metabolism in health and disease, as well as to explore new lipid biomarkers. The plasma lipidome of 12 Quaker parrots was investigated using UHPLC-MS/MS with both targeted and untargeted methods. Targeted methods on 6 replicates measured 432 lipids comprised of sterol, cholesterol ester, bile acid, fatty acid, acylcarnitine, glycerolipid, glycerophospholipid, and sphingolipid panels. For untargeted lipidomics, precursor ion mass-to-charge ratios were matched to corresponding lipids using the LIPIDMAPS structure database and LipidBlast at the sum composition or acyl species level of information. Sterol lipids and glycerophospholipids constituted the majority of plasma lipids on a molar basis. The most common lipids detected with the targeted methods included free cholesterol, CE(18:2), CE(20:4) for sterol lipids; PC(36:2), PC(34:2), PC(34:1) for glycerophospholipids; TG(52:3), TG(54:4), TG(54:5), TG(52:2) for glycerolipids; SM(d18:1/16:0) for sphingolipids; and palmitic acid for fatty acyls. Over a thousand different lipid species were detected by untargeted lipidomics. Sex differences in the plasma lipidome were observed using heatmaps, principal component analysis, and discriminant analysis. This report presents the first comprehensive database of plasma lipid species in psittacine birds and paves the way for further research into blood lipid diagnostics and the impact of diet, diseases, and drugs on the parrot plasma lipidome."

Methods The data of 62,333 women with EH diagnostic codes from 2007 to 2018 were sourced from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service databases. The data from 11,525 women with non-atypical EH and 2,219 women with atypical EH who met the selection criteria were extracted for analysis. Results Risk of EC in women with EH decreased in 40–49 year olds compared to other ages (non-atypical EH: [≤39 vs. 40–49 years] HR, 0.557; 95% CI, 0.439–0.708; P&lt; 0.001; [≤39 vs. ≥50 years] P = 0.739; atypical EH: [≤39 vs. 40–49 years] HR, 0.391; 95% CI, 0.229–0.670; P = 0.001; [≤39 vs. ≥50 years] P = 0.712). Risk of EC increased with increase in number of follow-up biopsies in women with non-atypical EH (1 biopsy: HR, 1.835; 95% CI, 1.282–2.629; P = 0.001; ≥2 biopsies: HR, 3.644; 95% CI, 2.585–5.317; P &lt;0.001) and in women receiving ≥2 follow-up biopsies with atypical EH (HR, 3.827; 95% CI, 1.924–7.612; P = 0.001). Time of progression to EC decreased in women ≥50 years old with non-atypical EH compared to other ages ( P = 0.004) and showed no differences among ages in women with atypical EH ( P = 0.576). Progestational agents were a protective factor for EC in women with non-atypical EH (HR, 0.703; 95% CI, 0.565–0.876; P = 0.002). Conclusions In this claim data analysis, women ≤39 and ≥50 years old with EH were at a high risk for progression to EC, and repeat follow-up biopsy after a diagnosis of EH increased detection of EC. Progestational agents were an effective modality to prevent EC in women with non-atypical EH."
https://openalex.org/W3107154693,"Human behavior is framed by several social structures. In the present study, we focus on two of the most important determinants of social structures: social norms and political orientation. Social norms are implicit models of shared expectations about how people should behave in different social contexts. Although humans are very sensitive to violations in social norms, there are important individual differences in our sensitivity to these violations. The second concept this study focuses on is political orientation that is define by a continuum from left (liberal) to right (conservative). Individual political orientation has been found to be related to various individual traits, such as cognitive style or sensitivity to negative stimuli. Here, we propose to study the relation between sensitivity to social norm violation and political orientation. Participants completed a task presenting scenarios with different degrees of social norm violation and a questionnaire to measure their political opinions on economic and identity issues. Using hierarchical regressions, we show that individual differences in sensitivity to social norm violation are partly explained by political orientation, and more precisely by the identity axis. The more individuals have right-oriented political opinions, the more they are sensitive to social norm violation, even when multiple demographics variables are considered. Our results suggest that political orientation, especially according to identity issues, is a significant factor of individual differences in social norm processing."
https://openalex.org/W3107417406,"Introduction Teaching endotracheal intubation is uniquely challenging due to its technical, high-stakes, and highly time-sensitive nature. The GoPro is a small, lightweight, high-resolution action camera with a wide-angle field of view that can encompass both the airway as well as the procedurist’s hands and positioning technique when worn with a head mount. We aimed to evaluate its effectiveness in improving intubation teaching for novice learners in a simulated setting, via a two-arm, parallel group, randomized controlled superiority trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. Methods We recruited Year 4 medical students at the start of their compulsory 2-week Anesthesia posting. Participants underwent a standardized intubation curriculum and a formative assessment, then randomized to receive GoPro or non-GoPro led feedback. After a span of three months, participants were re-assessed in a summative assessment by blinded accessors. Participants were also surveyed on their learning experience for a qualitative thematic perspective. The primary outcomes were successful intubation and successful first-pass intubation. Results Seventy-one participants were recruited with no dropouts, and all were included in the analysis. 36 participants received GoPro led feedback, and 35 participants received non-GoPro led feedback. All participants successfully intubated the manikin. No statistically significant differences were found between the GoPro group and the non-GoPro group at summative assessment (85.3% vs 90.0%, p = 0.572). Almost all participants surveyed found the GoPro effective for their learning (98.5%). Common themes in the qualitative analysis were: the ability for an improved assessment, greater identification of small details that would otherwise be missed, and usefulness of the unique point-of-view footage in improving understanding. Conclusions The GoPro is a promising tool for simulation-based intubation teaching. There are considerations in its implementation to maximize the learning experience and yield from GoPro led feedback and training."
https://openalex.org/W3107639281,"The aim of this study was to assess the magnitude, socio-demographic, and clinical characteristics of oesophageal cancer patients in selected referral hospitals of Ethiopia. A retrospective document review was employed in ten referral hospitals in different regions of Ethiopia. A structured data extraction tool was used to extract data from clinical care records of all clinically and pathologically confirmed oesophageal cancer patients who were diagnosed and treated in those hospitals from 2012 to 2017. During the study period, a total of 777 oesophageal cancer cases were identified, and the median age of these patients was 55 years, with an interquartile range of 19. More than half (55.1%, n = 428) of the cases were males, and the majority of them were reported from Oromia (49.9%, n = 388) and Somali (25.9%, n = 202) regional states. The highest numbers of oesophageal cancer cases were recorded in 2016 (23.8%, n = 185), while the lowest were in 2012 (12.6%, n = 98). Eighty per cent of oesophageal cancer cases were diagnosed in later stages of the disease. More than one-fourth (27.0%, n = 210) of patients had surgical procedures where the majority (74.3%, n = 156) required insertion of a feeding tube followed by transhiatal oesophagectomy (10.9%, n = 23). Of the 118 patients for which there was histology data, squamous cell carcinoma (56.7%, n = 67) and adenocarcinoma (36.4%, n = 43) were the predominant histologic type. One-fourth (25.0%, n = 194) of the patients were alive, and more than two-thirds (71.7%, n = 557) of the patients’ current status was unknown at the time of the review. In these referral hospitals of Ethiopia, many oesophageal cancer patients presented during later stages of the disease and needed palliative care measures. The number of patients seen in Oromia and Somali hospitals by far exceeded hospitals of the other regions, thus postulating possibly unique risk factors in those geographic areas."

The production of itaconate in biological systems is catalyzed by cis-aconitate decarboxylase (CAD, also known as immune responsive gene 1 (IRG1) in mammals). In this study, we solved the structure of IRG1 from Mus musculus (mouse IRG1). Structural comparison analysis revealed that IRG1 can exist in either an open or closed conformation and that this is controlled by the A1 loop located proximal to the active site. Our closed form structure was maintained by an unidentified molecule in the active site, which might mimic its substrate.

https://openalex.org/W3109098342,"Massive, long-lived deep-sea red tree corals ( Primnoa pacifica ) form a solid, layered axis comprised of calcite and gorgonin skeleton. They are abundant on the outer continental shelf and upper slope of the Northeast Pacific, providing habitat for fish and invertebrates. Yet, their large size and arborescent morphology makes them susceptible to disturbance from fishing activities. A better understanding of their growth patterns will facilitate in-situ estimates of population age structure and biomass. Here, we evaluated relationships between ages, growth rates, gross morphological characteristics, and banding patterns in 11 colonies collected from depths of ~141–335 m off the Alaskan coast. These corals ranged in age from 12 to 80 years old. They grew faster radially (0.33–0.74 mm year -1 ) and axially (2.41–6.39 cm year -1 ) than in previously measured older colonies, suggesting that growth in P . pacifica declines slowly with age, and that basal diameter and axial height eventually plateau. However, since coral morphology correlated with age in younger colonies (&lt; century), we developed an in-situ age estimation technique for corals from the Northeast Pacific Ocean providing a non-invasive method for evaluating coral age without removing colonies from the population. Furthermore, we determined that annual bands provided the most accurate means for determining coral age in live-collected corals, relative to radiometric dating. Taken together, this work provides insight into P . pacifica growth patterns to inform coastal managers about the demographics of this ecologically important species. With this new ability to estimate the age of red tree corals in-situ , we can readily determine the age-class structure and consequently, the maturity status of thickets, using non-invasive video survey techniques when coupled with mensuration systems such as lasers or stereo-cameras. Enhanced surveys could identify which populations are most vulnerable to disturbance from human activities, and which should be highlighted for protection."
https://openalex.org/W3109509713,"In this paper, two new aggregation operators based on Choquet integral, namely the induced generalized interval neutrosophic Choquet integral average operator(IGINCIA) and the induced generalized interval neutrosophic Choquet integral geometric operator(IG-INCIG), are proposed for multi-criteria decision making problems (MCDM). Firstly, the criteria are dependent to each other and the evaluation information of the criteria are expressed by interval neutrosophic numbers. Moreover, two indices which are inspired by the geometrical structure are established to compare the interval neutrosophic numbers. Then, a MCDM method is proposed based on the proposed aggregation operators and ranking indices to cope with MCDM with interactive criteria. Lastly, an investment decision making problem is provided to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The validity and advantages of the proposed method are analyzed by comparing with some existing approaches. By a numerical example in company investment to expand business though five alternatives with considering four criteria, the optimal decision is made."
https://openalex.org/W3109758900,"Background The All Our Families (AOF) cohort study is a longitudinal population-based study which collected biological samples from 1948 pregnant women between May 2008 and December 2010. As the quality of samples can decline over time, the objective of the current study was to assess the association between storage time and RNA (ribonucleic acid) yield and purity, and confirm the quality of these samples after 7–10 years in long-term storage. Methods Maternal whole blood samples were previously collected by trained phlebotomists and stored in four separate PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (PreAnalytiX) between 2008 and 2011. RNA was isolated in 2011 and 2018 using PAXgene Blood RNA Kits (PreAnalytiX) as per the manufacturer’s instruction. RNA purity (260/280), as well as RNA yield, were measured using a Nanodrop. The RNA integrity number (RIN) was also assessed from 5–25 and 111–130 months of storage using RNA 6000 Nano Kit and Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer. Descriptive statistics, paired t-test, and response feature analysis using linear regression were used to assess the association between various predictor variables and quality of the RNA isolated. Results Overall, RNA purity and yield of the samples did not decline over time. RNA purity of samples isolated in 2011 (2.08, 95% CI: 2.08–2.09) were statistically lower (p&lt;0.000) than samples isolated in 2018 (2.101, 95% CI: 2.097, 2.104), and there was no statistical difference between the 2011 (13.08 μg /tube, 95% CI: 12.27–13.89) and 2018 (12.64 μg /tube, 95% CI: 11.83–13.46) RNA yield (p = 0.2964). For every month of storage, the change in RNA purity is -0.01(260/280), and the change in RNA yield between 2011 and 2018 is -0.90 μ g / tube. The mean RIN was 8.49 (95% CI:8.44–8.54), and it ranged from 7.2 to 9.5. The rate of change in expected RIN per month of storage is 0.003 (95% CI 0.002–0.004), so while statistically significant, these results are not relevant. Conclusions RNA quality does not decrease over time, and the methods used to collect and store samples, within a population-based study are robust to inherent operational factors which may degrade sample quality over time."

A field experiment was designed to explore the relationship between the CO 2 flow rate and the trapping effect of BG traps. The aim was to select an appropriate flow rate for monitoring Aedes albopictus . Six sampling sites were selected for field experiments in Hangzhou city, Zhejiang Province, China. A total of six CO 2 flow rates (0.00 L/min, 0.075 L/min, 0.15 L/min, 0.30 L/min, 0.60 L/min and 1.20 L/min) were tested to compare their effects on mosquito trapping. The catches were performed in six trapping periods between 15:30 and 18:30, and each catch period lasted 0.5 h. A total of 3068 adult mosquitoes were captured at six sampling sites in six days using BG traps (with BG-Sweetscent), among which 86.96% were Ae . albopictus . The total number of Ae . albopictus (males and females) captured at a flow rate of 0.00 L/min was significantly lower than the numbers captured at 0.075 L/min, 0.15 L/min, 0.30 L/min, 0.60 L/min and 1.20 L/min ( P &lt;0.001, P &lt;0.001, P &lt;0.001, P &lt;0.001, and P &lt;0.001 respectively). The total number of Ae . albopictus captured and the number of Ae . albopictus females captured increased with increasing CO 2 flow and peaked at 0.3 L/min, above which these capture numbers did not increase significantly. In conclusion, the appropriate CO 2 flow rate for monitoring Ae . albopictus with BG traps was 0.3 L/min."
https://openalex.org/W3107337679,"Regulatory regions, like promoters and enhancers, cover an estimated 5–15% of the human genome. Changes to these sequences are thought to underlie much of human phenotypic variation and a substantial proportion of genetic causes of disease. However, our understanding of their functional encoding in DNA is still very limited. Applying machine or deep learning methods can shed light on this encoding and gapped k-mer support vector machines (gkm-SVMs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly trained on putative regulatory sequences. Here, we investigate the impact of negative sequence selection on model performance. By training gkm-SVM and CNN models on open chromatin data and corresponding negative training dataset, both learners and two approaches for negative training data are compared. Negative sets use either genomic background sequences or sequence shuffles of the positive sequences. Model performance was evaluated on three different tasks: predicting elements active in a cell-type, predicting cell-type specific elements, and predicting elements' relative activity as measured from independent experimental data. Our results indicate strong effects of the negative training data, with genomic backgrounds showing overall best results. Specifically, models trained on highly shuffled sequences perform worse on the complex tasks of tissue-specific activity and quantitative activity prediction, and seem to learn features of artificial sequences rather than regulatory activity. Further, we observe that insufficient matching of genomic background sequences results in model biases. While CNNs achieved and exceeded the performance of gkm-SVMs for larger training datasets, gkm-SVMs gave robust and best results for typical training dataset sizes without the need of hyperparameter optimization."
https://openalex.org/W3109625643,"Background To prospectively investigate retinal vascular changes in patients undergoing epiretinal membrane (ERM) and internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling using swept source optical coherence tomography angiography (SSOCTA). Methods Consecutive patients were grouped based on ERM severity and followed using SSOCTA up to month 3 after surgical intervention. Superficial and deep foveal avascular zone (s/dFAZ) as well as foveal and parafoveal vessel density (VD) were correlated with ERM severity and visual acuity. Differences between groups were evaluated. Results Significant correlations were found between ERM severity and baseline sFAZ, dFAZ and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal subfield thickness (CST) and ΔCST (r = -0.52, r = -0.43, r = -0.42, r = 0.58, r = 0.39; all p&lt;0.05). Vascular flow parameters did not correlate with age, peeling size, pseudophakia or CST, but correlated with intraretinal cysts presence. No associations of BCVA with any of the OCTA parameters across time were found. Significant differences between ERM severity groups 1 and 2 were found for sFAZ at baseline (p = 0.005) and at the 3-month follow-up (p = 0.014), and for dFAZ at baseline (p = 0.017). Superficial foveal and parafoveal VD were not significantly different between groups (all p&gt;0.05). Conclusions This study clearly shows that ERM severity based on ERM staging has to be taken into account when undertaking studies in patients with idiopathic ERM using SSOCTA. Further, specific changes in the superficial and deep retinal vasculature in eyes undergoing ERM and ILM peeling were found. However, the clinical usefulness and prognostic value for post-surgical treatment BCVA of the SSOCTA-derived variables (sFAZ and dFAZ area, as well as foveal and parafoveal VD) used remains questionable."

https://openalex.org/W3107670889,"Children and adolescents commonly suffer from sleep and circadian rhythm disturbances, which may contribute to poorer mental health and wellbeing during this critical developmental phase. Many studies however rely on self-reported sleep measures. This study assessed whether accelerometry data collection was feasible within the school setting as a method for investigating the extent of sleep and circadian disruption, and associations with subjective wellbeing, in Scotland. Fourteen days of wrist-worn accelerometry data were collected from 69 pupils, aged 10-14 years. Objective measures of sleep timing, sleep duration and circadian rest-activity patterns were derived. Questionnaires assessed subjective sleep timing, depressive symptoms, and experiences of wearing the accelerometer. Pupils slept on average less than 8 hours per night, failing to meet standard age-specific recommendations. Sleep timing was later and duration longer on weekends compared to weekdays (B = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70, 1.04; B = 0.49, 95% CI 0.29, 0.69), indicating social jetlag. Lower daytime activity was correlated with higher depressive symptoms (r = -0.84, p = 0.008). Compared to primary school pupils, secondary pupils had shorter sleep window duration and lower circadian relative amplitude. Over half of participants reported some discomfort/inconvenience wearing the accelerometer. These data highlight that inadequate sleep is prevalent in this sample of schoolchildren. Future, larger scale investigations will examine in more detail the associations between sleep, circadian function and physical activity with mental health and wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W3108491793,"Purpose The time-of-day variations in environmental heat stress have been known to affect thermoregulatory responses and the risk of exertional heat-related illness during outdoor exercise in the heat. However, such effect and risk are still needed to be examined during indoor sports/exercises. The current study investigated the diurnal relationships between thermoregulatory strain and environmental heat stress during regular judo training in a judo training facility without air conditioning on a clear day in the heat of summer. Methods Eight male high school judokas completed two 2.5-h indoor judo training sessions. The sessions were commenced at 09:00 h (AM) and 16:00 h (PM) on separate days. Results During the sessions, indoor and outdoor heat stress progressively increased in AM but decreased in PM, and indoor heat stress was less in AM than PM (mean ambient temperature: AM 32.7±0.4°C; PM 34.4±1.0°C, P &lt;0.01). Mean skin temperature was higher in AM than PM ( P &lt;0.05), despite greater dry and evaporative heat losses in AM than PM ( P &lt;0.001). Infrared tympanic temperature, heart rate and thermal sensation demonstrated a trial by time interaction ( P &lt;0.001) with no differences at any time point between trials, showing relatively higher responses in these variables in PM compared to AM during the early stages of training and in AM compared to PM during the later stages of training. There were no differences between trials in body mass loss and rating of perceived exertion. Conclusions This study indicates a greater thermoregulatory strain in the morning from 09:00 h than the late afternoon from 16:00 h during 2.5-h regular judo training in no air conditioning facility on a clear day in the heat of summer. This observation is associated with a progressive increase in indoor and outdoor heat stress in the morning, despite a less indoor heat stress in the morning than the afternoon."
https://openalex.org/W3108919246,"Background The association of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) with risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has been inconsistent in previous studies. Methods We examined the associations of BMI and WC in relation to risk of GBS among 252,980 participants from the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), NHS-II, and the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS). BMI and WC were assessed by self-reported questionnaire, and GBS cases were self-reported. Results We documented 328 incident GBS cases during a total of 5,422,788 person years of follow-up. Compared to participants with BMI&lt;25kg/m 2 , the multivariate pooled hazard ratio (HR) of GBS was 1.34 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.73) for overweight participants (25kg/m 2 ≤BMI&lt;30 kg/m 2 ), and 1.68 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.35) for obese participants (BMI≥30 kg/m 2 ) (P for trend = 0.001). Compared to participants with normal WC (&lt;35 inches for women and &lt;40 inches for men), the HR of GBS was 1.55 (95% CI: 1.10, 2.18) for participants with high WC (≥35 inches for women, and ≥40 inches for men). The positive associations of BMI and WC with risk of GBS were attenuated to null after mutually adjusting for BMI and WC. Joint analysis showed that the HR was 1.84 (95% CI: 1.27, 2.66) for participants with high WC and BMI≥25 kg/m 2 in comparison to participants with normal WC and BMI&lt;25kg/m 2 . Conclusion These data from large cohorts showed that higher BMI and WC jointly were associated with higher risk of GBS. Our study highlighted the importance of maintaining a normal body weight and waist circumference in prevention of GBS."

Fever is seen in most cases of COVID-19, at least at the initial stages of illness. Although fever is typically treated (with antipyretics or directly with ice or other mechanical means), increasing data suggest that fever is a protective adaptive response that facilitates recovery from infectious illness. Objective To describe a randomized controlled pilot study of core warming patients with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation. Methods This prospective single-site randomized controlled pilot study will enroll 20 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care or to receive core warming via an esophageal heat exchanger commonly utilized in critical care and surgical patients. The primary outcome is patient viral load measured by lower respiratory tract sample. Secondary outcomes include severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome (as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio) 24, 48, and 72 hours after initiation of treatment, hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and 30-day mortality. Results Resulting data will provide effect size estimates to guide a definitive multi-center randomized clinical trial. ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT04426344. Conclusions With growing data to support clinical benefits of elevated temperature in infectious illness, this study will provide data to guide further understanding of the role of active temperature management in COVID-19 treatment and provide effect size estimates to power larger studies."

The rate of stray dog vaccination is suboptimal in India. This study aims to develop an intervention strategy, using Intervention Mapping framework, tailored for the target community to achieve canine rabies controlled zone. Methodology This is an exploratory, cross-sectional study conducted at a tertiary care Medical Institute at Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India, from 2018–2019. The semi-structured, In-Depth Discussion was conducted with a multidisciplinary planning group comprising of members from veterinary, health, and administrative sectors. The In-Depth Discussion focused on knowledge regarding complete stray dog vaccination schedule, self-efficacy (to prevent dog bites), challenges, and barriers faced by residents to achieve canine rabies controlled zone. Further, discussion with veterinary stakeholders focused on challenges faced for rigorous implementation of stray dog vaccination and sterilization. Results In-Depth Discussion revealed the following challenges: Lack of participation by the study population for canine vaccination, incomplete knowledge about annual canine vaccination schedule, lack of understanding of dog gestures, lack of infrastructure and resources at veterinary hospitals. The majority of the dogs in the study area were stray dogs that were partially or non-vaccinated and non-sterilized. An intersectoral collaboration was achieved between the community members, veterinary stakeholders both private and Non-Governmental organisations, and heath sector. Following which 35 (76.0%) stray dogs were vaccinated, and 17 (35.4%) were sterilized with community support. Burden of dog bite cases also decreased. The stray dog density map was prepared, and community engagement activity on dog gestures was conducted. Conclusion The present study demonstrates the feasibility of achieving canine rabies controlled zone. When implemented in a phase-wise manner across all Medical and Residential complex, this strategy would ensure achieving canine rabies controlled zone through multi-stakeholder engagement."

Forty-five women living with HIV in the greater Gaborone, Botswana area participated in focus group discussions. Themes were analyzed using interpretive phenomenology. Despite low knowledge of specific safer conception methods that can be used to prevent transmission of HIV when trying to achieve pregnancy, there was noted interest in pre-exposure prophylaxis and vaginal insemination. Challenges to greater uptake were noted including a lack of knowledge about a range of SC methods, limited partner support and communication, provider stigma, health systems barriers, current policies, and the cultural acceptability of methods. Interventions will need to address these challenges and be responsive to the needs and reflect the realities of WLHIV who desire pregnancy in order for safer conception uptake to become a common practice."
https://openalex.org/W3108147316,"Background Providing high quality care is important and has gained more attention since the introduction of value-based healthcare. Value should be measured by outcomes achieved, relevant for patients. Patient-centeredness is one domain for quality improvement determined by the Institute of Medicine, aiming to deliver care responsive to the patient. The development and implementation of patient reported outcome- and experience measures can be used for this goal. Recently, we developed the Patient Reported Measure (PRM)-acute care, based on five relevant domains to evaluate and improve the quality of care in the Emergency Department (ED). Objective To validate the PRM-acute care, in order to evaluate and improve patient-centered care in the ED. Methods We performed a prospective questionnaire-based study. Patients ≥18 years presenting for internal medicine in the ED were eligible. The validity of the PRM-acute care was evaluated according to the COSMIN-criteria. We performed hypotheses testing to evaluate construct validity. The perceived quality of care was evaluated by statistical analysis. Results Face- and content validity was evaluated based on previously performed research and deemed good. Construct validity was supported by demonstrated differences between subgroups; patients with severe symptoms had a higher perceived quality of care. The correlation between overall satisfaction and the total mean score of the PRM-acute care (r = 0,447, p = 0.01) was significant. Overall, patients reported a mean perceived quality of care of 4.67/6.0. Conclusion The PRM-acute care is a valid instrument to measure the perceived quality of care in an acute setting for internal medicine patients. Additionally, patients reported a good perceived quality of care in the ED with scores ranging from moderate to well for each of the relevant domains. Therefore, we believe that the PRM-acute care can be implemented in daily practice to evaluate the perceived quality of care and to improve the quality of acute care."
https://openalex.org/W3108411995,"Prenylated Rab Acceptor 1 (PRA1/Rabac1) is a four-pass transmembrane protein that has been found to localize to the Golgi and promiscuously associate with a diverse array of Rab GTPases. We have previously identified PRA1 to be among the earliest significantly down-regulated genes in the rd1 mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa, a retinal degenerative disease. Here, we show that an endogenous subpopulation of PRA1 resides within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites in cultured mammalian cells. We also demonstrate that PRA1 contains two previously unidentified ER retention/retrieval amino acid sequences on its cytosolic N-terminal region: a membrane distal di-arginine motif and a novel membrane proximal FFAT-like motif. Using a truncation construct that lacks complete Golgi targeting information, we show that mutation of either motif leads to an increase in cell surface localization, while mutation of both motifs exhibits an additive effect. We also present evidence that illustrates that N- or C- terminal addition of a tag to full-length PRA1 leads to differential localization to either the Golgi or reticular ER, phenotypes that do not completely mirror endogenous protein localization. The presence of multiple ER retention motifs on the PRA1 N-terminal region further suggests that it has a functional role within the ER."
https://openalex.org/W3108457427,"Objective Aerobic fitness may be beneficial for neuroanatomical structure. However, few have investigated this in emerging adults while also accounting for potential sex differences. Here we examine aerobic fitness level, sex, and their interaction in relation to cortical thickness, surface area, and volume. Method Sixty-three young adults between the ages of 16–26 were balanced for sex and demonstrated a wide range of aerobic fitness levels. Exclusion criteria included left-handedness, past-year independent Axis-I disorders, major medical/neurologic disorders, prenatal medical issues, prenatal alcohol/illicit drug exposure, or excessive substance use. Participants completed an MRI scan and a graded exercise test to volitional fatigue (VO 2 max). Data analyses were run in Freesurfer and data was corrected for multiple comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations at .05. Results Males demonstrated higher VO 2 values. Higher VO 2 values were statistically independently related to thinner lateral occipital, superior parietal, cuneus, precuneus, and inferior parietal regions, smaller lateral occipital volume, and larger inferior parietal surface area. Compared to females, males had larger volume in rostral anterior cingulate, lateral occipital, and superior frontal regions, and greater surface area in fusiform, inferior parietal, rostral and caudal anterior cingulate, and superior parietal regions. VO 2 *Sex interactions revealed higher-fit females had higher inferior parietal, paracentral, and supramarginal surface area, while lower-fit males showed larger surface area in these same regions. Conclusions Individuals with higher aerobic fitness performance had thinner cortices, lower volume, and larger surface area in sensorimotor regions than lower fit individuals, perhaps suggesting earlier neuromaturation in higher fit individuals. Larger surface area was associated with higher-fit females and lower-fit males. Thus both sex and aerobic fitness are important in shaping brain health in emerging adults."
https://openalex.org/W3108846138,"Non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention efforts have traditionally targeted high-risk and high-burden populations. We propose an alteration in prevention efforts to also include emphasis and focus on low-risk populations, predominantly younger individuals and low-prevalence populations. We refer to this approach as “proactive prevention.” This emphasis is based on the priority to put in place policies, programs, and infrastructure that can disrupt the epidemiological transition to develop NCDs among these groups, thereby averting future NCD crises. Proactive prevention strategies can be classified, and their implementation prioritized, based on a 2-dimensional assessment: impact and feasibility. Thus, potential interventions can be categorized into a 2-by-2 matrix: high impact/high feasibility, high impact/low feasibility, low impact/high feasibility, and low impact/low feasibility. We propose that high impact/high feasibility interventions are ready to be implemented ( a ct), while high impact/low feasibility interventions require efforts to foster b uy-in first. Low impact/high feasibility interventions need to be c hanged to improve their impact while low impact/low feasibility might be best re- d esigned in the context of limited resources. Using this framework, policy makers, public health experts, and other stakeholders can more effectively prioritize and leverage limited resources in an effort to slow or prevent the evolving global NCD crisis."
https://openalex.org/W3108231577,"Background As nurses work highly irregular hours, the characteristics of shiftwork and aspects of their private lives are important factors that may contribute significantly to work-life conflict. Purpose This study examined the effects of nurses’ shiftwork characteristics and aspects of their private lives on work-life conflict. Methods The participants included 271 registered nurses working three-shift rotations in five types of units at four hospitals in South Korea. We distributed structured questionnaires regarding shiftwork characteristics, private life, and work-life conflict. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis. Results The significant factors relating to work-life conflict included control over shift start and finish times (β = -0.16, p = .019), frequency of swapping shifts with colleagues (β = 0.15, p = .025) among shiftwork characteristics, and leisure constraints (β = 0.39, p = &lt; .001) in aspects of private life. Conclusion Plan and policies for improving nursing environments should focus on improving nurses’ control over shiftwork and decreasing leisure constraints."
https://openalex.org/W3108425248,"Sport teams work in complex environments in which each member’s tasks are mutually dependent on those of the others. To function effectively, expert teams generate Shared Mental Models (SMMs) to help adapt their own behavior to that of the others and master upcoming actions. Although SMMs have been discussed in domains such as organizations, there is still little research in the context of sport. One reason for this is that measurement methods have failed to incorporate the dynamic nature of the sport context. This study reports on the development of a video-based measurement of SMMs in tennis doubles. It examined the quality criteria first in a pilot and then in a main study. The final video-based measurement consists of 35 tennis doubles video clips requiring decisions on ball-taking behavior in two conditions ( Self and Partner ). In the condition Self , participants reported their own responses; in the condition Partner , those of their partner. The main study analyzed 29 male tennis teams with a mean age of 34.57 years ( SD = 12.25) and a mean of 22.79 years ( SD = 10.49) tennis experience. SMMs were analyzed for each partner as the inter-player agreement ( Self–Partner ) and averaged for each team. After completing the video-based measurement, participants filled out questionnaires on SMMs, team trust, and demographics. Results indicated that not only the split-half reliability ( r = .49), the content validity (η p 2 = .23), the inter-player agreement ( r = .63), and the inter-player agreement and accuracy ( r = .61), but also the feasibility of the measurement were good. However, no relationships to the proposed convergent or criterial validity measures were found. In sum, measuring SMMs with a video-based test is possible and a promising method. No relationship to the frequently used questionnaires was found, suggesting that the two target different parts of SMMs. Future research should carefully examine and choose the appropriate measurement."
https://openalex.org/W3108834406,"Anthropogenic disturbances in forest management practices can affect wild edible plants. Soil scarification is a large-scale disturbance that may cause long-term reduction in productivity of edible dwarf bamboo, Sasa kurilensis , in northern Japan. For their effective and sustainable use, we need to understand the recovery process after such disturbances. At 14 study sites in the Teshio Experimental Forest of Hokkaido University where soil scarification had been conducted between 2 and 44 years prior, the number and stem diameter of old and young (newly emerged, edible) culms was recorded. At sites that were within 11 years of soil scarification, the proportion of old culms (&lt;11%) was lower than in the control area where soil scarification had never been conducted. At sites where more than 15 years had passed since soil scarification, the relative number of old culms was nearly equal to that in control area. Additionally, the number of young culms increased with an increasing number of old culms. These results suggest that recovery of productivity (in term of number) of edible culms may take a few decades. In contrast, the culm diameter of young culms increased linearly with time since soil scarification, but the 95% confidence interval in this relationship suggests that dwarf bamboo can produce thick edible culms soon after soil scarification. These findings will provide useful insights into how to obtain high quality bamboo culms following anthropogenic disturbances in future."
https://openalex.org/W3109190670,"Information in working memory (WM) can guide visual attention towards matched features. While recent work has suggested that cognitive control can act upon WM guidance of visual attention, little is known about how the state of memorized items retaining in WM contribute to its influence over attention. Here, we disentangle the role of inhibition and maintenance on WM-guided attention with a novel delayed match-to-sample dual-task. The results showed that active inhibition facilitated searching by diminishing sensory processing and deterring attentional guidance, indexed by an attenuated P1 amplitude and unaffected N2pc amplitude, respectively. By contrast, active maintenance impaired searching by attentional guidance while sensory processing remained unimpaired, indexed by an enhanced N2pc amplitude and unchanged P1 amplitude, respectively. Furthermore, multivariate pattern analyses could sucessfully decode maintenance and inhibition, suggesting that two states differed in modulating visual attention. We propose that remembered contents may play an anchoring role for attentional guidance, and the state of those contents retaining in WM may directly influence the shifting of attention. The maintenance could guide attention by accessing input information, while the inhibition could deter the shifting of attention by suppressing sensory processing. These findings provide a possible reinterpretation of the influence of WM on attention."
https://openalex.org/W3109206863,"The origins of linguistic diversity remain controversial. Studies disagree on whether group features such as population size or social structure accelerate or decelerate linguistic differentiation. While some analyses of between-group factors highlight the role of geographical isolation and reduced linguistic exchange in differentiation, others suggest that linguistic divergence is driven primarily by warfare among neighbouring groups and the use of language as marker of group identity. Here we provide the first integrated test of the effects of five historical sociodemographic and geographic variables on three measures of linguistic diversification among 50 Austronesian languages: rates of word gain, loss and overall lexical turnover. We control for their shared evolutionary histories through a time-calibrated phylogenetic sister-pairs approach. Results show that languages spoken in larger communities create new words at a faster pace. Within-group conflict promotes linguistic differentiation by increasing word loss, while warfare hinders linguistic differentiation by decreasing both rates of word gain and loss. Finally, we show that geographical isolation is a strong driver of lexical evolution mainly due to a considerable drift-driven acceleration in rates of word loss. We conclude that the motor of extreme linguistic diversity in Austronesia may have been the dispersal of populations across relatively isolated islands, favouring strong cultural ties amongst societies instead of warfare and cultural group marking."
https://openalex.org/W3110080034,"Reactive oxygen species modulator 1 (romo1) causes cell hyperplasia and promotes cancer cell invasion. Based recent studies, the overexpression of romo1 is associated with lymphatic metastasis and poor prognosis in lung cancer. We aimed to evaluate associations between romo1 expression and lymph node metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Clinical data and pathological results were retrospectively reviewed for 98 subjects diagnosed with NSCLC and who underwent surgical biopsy between 1994 and 2009. A total 98 tumor specimens were analyzed. The romo1 H score was correlated with stage and was significantly higher in subjects with lymph node metastasis than in those without metastasis (173 vs 116; P &lt; 0.05). The area (%) of grade 1 expression was significantly smaller (19.5 vs 37.0; P = 0.005) and the area of grade 3 expression was significantly larger (27.9 vs 6.00; P &lt; 0.001) in subjects with lymph node metastasis than in those without metastasis. In stage I patients, disease free survival (DFS) (191 ± 18.8 vs. 75.6 ± 22.4 months, P = 0.004) was significantly longer in the low romo1 group than in the high romo1 group. A multivariate analysis showed a significant association between high romo1 expression and poor DFS (hazard ratio 5.59, 95 confidence interval, 1.54–20.3, P = 0.009). These findings support the prognostic value of romo1 in NSCLC, especially in stage I."
