https://openalex.org/W2030453949,"Madagascar is biologically one of the richest areas on Earth, and its plants and animals are among the most endangered. Satellite images and vegetation maps based on earlier aerial photographs were used to determine the extent of eastern rain forests in Madagascar and to monitor the rate of deforestation over a 35-year period. In 1985, 3.8 million hectares of rain forest remained, representing only 50 percent of the 7.6 million hectares existing in 1950 and 34 percent of the estimated orignal extent (11.2 million hectares). Between 1950 and 1985, the rate of deforestation averaged 111,000 hectares per year. Deforestation was most rapid in areas with low topographic relief and high population density. If cutting of forests continues at the same pace, only forests on the steepest slopes will survive the next 35 years."
https://openalex.org/W2054959845,"A synthetic five-part molecular device has been prepared that uses a multistep electron transfer strategy similar to that of photosynthetic organisms to capture light energy and convert it to chemical potential in the form of long-lived charge separation. It consists of two covalently linked porphyrin moieties, one containing a zinc ion (P(Zn)) and the other present as the free base (P). The metailated porphyrin bears a carotenoid polyene (C) and the other a diquinone species (Q(A)-Q(B)). Excitation of the free-base porphyrin in a chloroform solution of the pentad yields an initial charge-separated state, C-P(Zn)-P(.+).-Q(A)(-)-Q(B), with a quantum yield of 0.85. Subsequent electron transfer steps lead to a final charge-separated state, C(.+)-P(Zn)-P-Q(A)-Q(B)(.-), which is formed with an overall quantum yield of 0.83 and has a lifetime of 55 microseconds. Irradiation of the free-base form of the pentad, C-P-P-Q(A)-Q(B), gives a similar charge-separated state with a lower quantum yield (0.15 in dichloromethane), although the lifetime is increased to approximately 340 microseconds. The artificial photosynthetic system preserves a significant fraction ( approximately 1.0 electron volt) of the initial excitation energy (1.9 electron volts) in the long-lived, charge-separated state."
https://openalex.org/W2017518956,"Newly discovered Phyllobaenus beetles are parasites of a mutualism. Piper ant-plants in tropical forests provide lipid and protein-rich food cells and shelter for Pheidok bicornis ants while the ants remove small herbivores and vines from the foliage. In contrast to all other ant-plants, Piper ant-plants produce food bodies only when Pheidole bicornis is present in the plant. However, Phyllobaenus beetles can stimulate the plants to produce food bodies as if ants were present. The beetles then inhabit the plant, exploiting nest sites and food produced by the plants for ants. These beetles may also prey on ant brood, depriving the plants of resources and services provided by the ants."

Applying corrections for altitude change caused by sea level fluctuations enables evaluation of long-term average Holocene uplift rates for three areas across an active convergent margin: (i) the Hengchun Peninsula of the Eurasian tectonic plate; (ii) the Eastern Coastal Range of Taiwan, a plate boundary; and (iii) two offshore islands, Lanyu and Lutao, both situated on the leading edge of the adjoining Philippine Plate. The data indicate that while all three areas have experienced uplift through the Holocene, plate collision has caused significantly higher uplift rates in the region directly along the plate boundary."

The Hubble Space Telescope will reveal the shapes, sizes, and content of faint, distant galaxies and could discover a new population of Galactic stars."

I must, however, disclaim any especial competence to speak for these sciences, and I know not where there is less need in our country of emphasizing the importance and significance of the natural and physical sciences, or where the representatives of these sciences have brought higher distinction to themselves and to their university, than here in the University of Chicago. The past century is memorable above all others for the gigantic progress of the natural and physical sciencesâ€”a progress which has influenced more profoundly"
