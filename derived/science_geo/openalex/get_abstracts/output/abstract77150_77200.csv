https://openalex.org/W2008927843,"In eight patients with intense chronic cutaneous pain, sensory nerves or roots. supplying the painful area were stimulated. Square-wave 0.1-millisecond pulses at 100 cycles per second were applied, and the voltage was raised until the patient reported tingling in the area. During this stimulation, pressure on previously sensitive areas failed to evoke pain. Four patients, who had diseases of their peripheral nerves, experienced relief of their pain for more than half an hour after stimulation for 2 minutes."
https://openalex.org/W1964119248,"Development of a rapid and sensitive radioassay has permitted study of the conversion of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan in mammalian tissues. Of normal tissues examined, beef and rat pineal gland contained the highest activity. This is the first direct demonstration of tryptophan hydroxylase in this hydroxyindole-rich tissue. Rat and rabbit brainstem and human carcinoid tumor also had quantities of enzyme that could be measured easily. The reaction requires a reduced pteridine and oxygen and is inhibited by para-chlorophenylalanine."
https://openalex.org/W1995779094,"Rats were permitted to ingest a novel food and a familiar food. One hour later they were x-irradiated. When they were subsequently allowed to choose between these foods, their preference for the novel food was less than that exhibited by appropriate controls."
https://openalex.org/W1965394702,Enzymes which catalyze the hydrolysis of glucocerebroside and sphingomyelin have been demonstrated in preparations of washed human white blood cells. The level of activity of these respective enzymes is markedly decreased in leukocyte preparations obtained from patients with Gaucher's and Niemann-Pick diseases. Assay of these enzymes may be useful in the differential diagnosis of the sphingolipidoses.
https://openalex.org/W1971831251,"A mutant strain of the Friend leukemia virus is described. The parental virus strain, passaged through ICR/Ha mice, shows no or very little activity by the spleen-focus assay in BALB/c mice (by comparison with highly susceptible DBA/2 and ICR/Ha mice) and produces typical Friend disease in these mice only exceptionally; susceptibility to this strain of virus is recessive in the (C57BL/6 x DBA/2) F(1). By contrast, the mutant virus strain is as active in BALB/c mice as in DBA/2 or ICR/Ha mice; susceptibility to the mutant virus strain is dominant in the (C57BL/6 x DBA/2) F(1)."
https://openalex.org/W2031897068,"Activity of the melatoninforming enzyme, hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase, in rat pineal is increased when the animal is exposed to continuous darkness, and it is decreased by exposure to continuous light. Response to environmental light is initiated in the retina and transmitted to the pineal by way of the central nervous system and the cervical sympathetics. The central visual pathway essential for mediation of this response is the inferior accessory optic tract. Visual pathways to thalamus and tectum do not participate in this response."
https://openalex.org/W2076959722,"Stimulation of the nerves innervating the proctodeum (hindgut) of the cockroach Periplaneta americana (L.) causes a slow-type, graded contraction of the longitudinal muscles. An unidentified substance, or substances, present in the foregut and hindgut, the specific activity of which is highest in the nerves innervating these organs, effects a similar contraction. This ""gut-factor"" is depleted from the hindgut after surgical section of the proctodeal nerves. None of Factors P(1) and P(2), 5-hydroxytryptamine, acetylcholine, adrenaline, noradrenaline, alpha-ami-nobutyric acid or glutamate duplicates the pharmacological behavior of this substance. The active factor is associated with subcellular particles that require centrifugal forces of approximately 1,000,000 g-min for sedimentation. The substance is inactivated in homogenates of gut tissue in the absence of suitable precautions. It is proposed that the ""gut-factor"" functions as an excitatory neuromuscular transmitter substance in insect visceral muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2007311509,"Genomic exclusion is an abnormal form of conjugation occurring between cells with defective micronuclei and normal cells with diploid micronuclei. The progeny are heterocaryons; each cell has an old macronucleus but a new diploid micronucleus derived from one meiotic product of the normal mate. Such cells express genes found in the old macronucleus, are sexually mature, and can be specifically selected. When inbred, they give rise to lines genetically homozygous at all known loci."
https://openalex.org/W2086275641,Inducers of pinocytosis in amoeba cause as much as a 50-fold decrease in the electrical resistance of the plasma membrane prior to the formation of the typical tunnels and vacuoles. In this state the thickness of the electron-transparent core or lamella of the unit membrane is at least twice as thick as that of the control. The changes in structure and resistance as well as the induction of pinocytosis are dependent on the initial external concentration of calcium. These changes are rapidly reversed when the concentration of calcium in the external medium is increased.
https://openalex.org/W2007412012,Plant peroxidase injected into the hemocoel is taken up in granules by almost all tissues. These granules may become multivesicular bodies or isolation bodies which later breakdown. There is most uptake and breakdown at times in the molt-intermolt cycle when cells are engaged in active syntheses.
https://openalex.org/W2024817429,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in erythrocytes of the Negro type associated with enzyme deficiency (A(-)) was separated by chromatography on a carboxymethyl-Sephadex column from the electrophoretically indistinguishable Negro variant with normal enzyme activity (A(+)). Quantitative immunologic neutralization tests indicated that the A(-) enzyme had about the same enzymatic and serological activity as the A(+) and the normal (B(+)) enzymes. The enzyme activity of the A(-) variant in young erythrocytes was similar to that in young cells from normal individuals, although the activity of the A(-) variant in unfractionated red cells was 10 to 15 percent of normal. These data indicate that the basic defect in the variant enzyme (A(-)) is a structural mutation which causes more rapid degradation of the enzyme during erythrocyte aging."
https://openalex.org/W2091204275,"Reaction times to a dim photopic stimulus were measured on a circle about the fovea, 15 degrees from the line of direct vision. Large variations in reaction time were found on various half meridians and were interpreted as reflecting the distribution of retinal receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2034365345,"Autoradiography with tritiated thymidine was used to study microbial growth directly in nature. The epiphyte Leucothrix mucor was used since it is a large filamentous bacterium with a characteristic morphology making it recognizable in natural collections. The technique was developed initially with pure cultures. The relation between growth rate and the rate of accumulation of radioactive cells permitted derivation of a constant for use in calculating growth rate in natural material and in two-membered cultures of L. mucor growing epiphytically on pure cultures of marine algae. The growth rate (generation time) in two-membered cultures with the red alga Antithamnion sarniense was 94 minutes under the conditions used. In nature the growth rate of a sample from Iceland was 685 minutes; that of a sample from Long Island Sound was 660 minutes. There was no evidence of preferential growth in the basal portion of bacterial filaments nearest the algal surface. However, filamentous growth in nature, but not in pure or two-membered culture, was nonrandom, growth being clustered in some regions."
https://openalex.org/W2047586146,"Inhibition of mitosis in vitro was observed in leukocytes from patients with acute infectious hepatitis. Similarly, in cultures of normal leukocytes, after the addition of small amounts of serum from patients with hepatitis, mitosis was suppressed. Although the incidence of mitosis became normal in leukocytes from convalescent patients, there were chromosomal abnormalities."

https://openalex.org/W2095043217,"In Amoeba proteus the transplantation of a nucleus engaged in DNA synthesis into a G(2)-phase (after DNA synthesis) cell results in inhibition of such synthesis. When the nucleus of a G(2) cell is transplanted into an S-phase (period of DNA synthesis) cell, such a nucleus may begin to synthesize DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2072428229,"Thymidine triphosphate-2-C(14) and other deoxynucleoside triphosphates are incorporated into the DNA of isolated mitochondria from rat liver cells. The reaction is partially dependent on the other deoxynucleoside triphosphates and proceeds in the virtual absence of bacteria. The product has the properties of mitochondrial rather than nuclear DNA, and end-group studies indicate labeling of the interior of the molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2068692059,"The effect of tetrodotoxin on excitability of internally perfused squid giant axons immersed in various sodium-free media was examined. Action potentials were found to be suppressed by this substance, with or without sodium ion in the external medium. Tetrodotoxin showed a strong suppressive effect upon action potentials produced in media containing salts of only divalent cations (CaCl(2), CaBr(2), SrCl(2), or BaCl(2)). Our findings concerning the action of tetrodotoxin do not support the separate-channel hypothesis for excitable membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1578053581,"Kuru, a familial degenerative disease of the nervous system occurring in a restricted area of the Highlands of New Guinea, has apparently been transmitted to chimpanzees, but not to any other of the many experimental hosts tried. Transmission of the kuru syndrome from chimpanzee to chimpanzee has now been effected, with a shortening of the incubation period to 1 year from the 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 years found on intracerebral passage of human brain tissue to chimpanzee. Other chimpanzees have been inoculated to determine the size and heat stability of the agent, its presence outside the nervous system, and its pathogenicity by other routes of inoculation."
https://openalex.org/W1979477149,Multiple-unit activity from many brain sites of the unrestrained cat was recorded by means of an averaging technique during all phases of sleep and waking. All thalamic and medial reticular sites showed activity levels closely correlated with the animal's observed behavior even under conditions when the electroencephalogram appeared dissociated from behavior.
https://openalex.org/W2051962485,"The rubber-like internal triangular hinge ligament from Pecten was studied by light and electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and chemical analysis. The ligament is composed of an amorphous protein, abductin. In physical properties abductin is similar to elastin and resilin but distinct by amino acid analysis. It is characterized by high concentrations of glycine and methionine."
https://openalex.org/W2070396971,"Samples of blood (hemolyzed) were obtained from the renal vein, the hepatic portal vein, and the heart of a freshly thawed specimen of Latimeria chalumnae. The coelacanth uses high concentrations of urea to maintain its serum osmolality at approximately that of sea water. The mean value for the total osmolality was 1181 milliosmoles per liter. The mean values (milliequivalents per liter) were: for sodium, 181; for potassium, 51.3; for calcium, 6.9; for magnesium, 28.7; for chloride, 199; and for bicarbonate, 4.7. The mean urea concentration was 355 millimoles per liter, and the mean nonprotein nitrogen was 1343 milligrams percent. Heart blood showed significantly lower values for osmolality (921 milliosmoles per liter) and nonprotein nitrogen (1030 mg percent) and was probably less severely contaminated with products of protein breakdown. Fluid from the anterior chamber of the eye showed values of 952 milliosmole/liter; the urea value for this fluid was 303 mmole/liter, and the magnesium was 7.3 meq/liter. The magnesium value for the aqueous humor was used to correct the abnormally high concentrations in the hemolyzed serum. The high level of serum potassium also was attributed to hemolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2017120814,"Urea occurs in liver of the coelacanth Latimeria chalumnae to the extent of about 1.7 percent by weight. It was determined quantitatively by reaction with 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione-2-oxime (Archibald reagent) and by measurement of ammonia released upon treatment with urease. Arginase and ornithine carbamoyltransferase, enzymes instrumental in the formation of urea in typical ureotelic vertebrates, occur in homogenates of coelacanth liver. Formed in part by the ornithine-urea cycle, urea may have an osmoregulatory function in the coelacanth as it has in elasmobranchs."

https://openalex.org/W1968977255,"Of several amino acids essential for optimum hemoglobin synthesis by the rabbit reticulocyte, only omission of tryptophan results in polyribosome disaggregation. This disaggregation is prevented by the omission of both tryptophan and an amino acid that is relatively more essential than tryptophan for hemoglobin synthesis. Since tryptophan is located only near the amino-terminal ends of both chains of rabbit globin, the results indicate that single ribosomes and those in polyribosomes are in a dynamic state in the intact cell."
https://openalex.org/W1979361323,"Presence of sodium in the bathing medium is not essential for the electrically excitable depolarizing electrogenesis of crayfish muscle fibers, production of action potentials being dependent on calcium. The depolarizing electrogenesis of the excitatory synaptic membrane component does require sodium, however, and this ion cannot be replaced by lithium as it can in spike electrogenesis of many cells. Ionophoretic applications of glutamate, which in the presence of sodium depolarize the cell by activating the excitatory synaptic membrane, are without effect in the absence of sodium. Not only is there no depolarization, but the membrane conductance also remains unchanged. Thus, in the absence of inward movement of sodium across the synaptic membrane there is also no outward movement of potassium. Accordingly, it seems that increased conductance for potassium is not an independent process in the synaptic membrane, whereas it is independent of sodium activation in spike electrogenesis. Chloride activation is independent, however; increase in conductance and the electrogenesis of the inhibitory synaptic component are not affected by the absence of sodium. Implications of these findings regarding the structure of differently excitable membrane components are discussed."

Implantation of cholesterol-filled or empty tubes in the median eminence in controls was ineffective. We conclude that decreases in the amount of testosterone reaching specific receptors in the median eminence or in nearby regions activate a mechanism that produces increased gonadotropin secretion."

https://openalex.org/W2003126665,"It is obvious that many disciplines confront ethical problems in research in which situational details may vary, but in which the same ethical principles may prevail. I write not in order to propose a definitive set of rules but to demonstrate how situations posing ethical problems can be reduced and more readily resolved by rational analysis of underlying issues and principles; I hope to stimulate further analysis and dialogue. It might be particularly helpful if researchers in a wide range of disciplines contributed experiences permitting a sharpening of guidelines. Finally, it is conceivable that a code of ethics might eventually be promulgated by a supradisciplinary body such as the AAAS, and that such a code could then be adapted and adopted by other scientific bodies and professional organizations-even by specific agencies such as research institutes, clinics, institutions, and schools."
https://openalex.org/W2050109473,"Nitrate ions potentiate twitch tension and enhance the increase in permeability to sugar which occurs in electrically stimulated frog sartorius muscles. However, the potentiating effect of nitrate ions on permeability is not dependent upon an increase in twitch tension. The possible relation of changes in permeability to alterations of the concentration of calcium ions in the cell is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1963751336,"Brine shrimp die within 5 days after being given doses of above 10-5 parts of DDT per million. At this and lower doses, shrimp deposited broods at a normal frequency, and cysts predominated. The number of cysts that emerged and the survival of larvae to adulthood from broods of treated parents exceeded those from controls. Therefore lethality based on induced dominant or sex-linked recessive gene mutation was not evident. Decreased fecundity is due to maternal debility."
https://openalex.org/W2074142774,"The activity of acetylcholinesterase in the inner plexiform layer of the rabbit retina was not affected detectably by prior section of the optic nerve. After the animals were treated with diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate, acetylcholinesterase reappeared in the somata of the amacrine cells and in certain cells of the ganglion cell layer before it reappeared in the inner plexiform fibers. This confirms the normal presence of acetylcholinesterase at the former site. The possible role of acetylcholine in intraretinal transmission is considered."

When test spot and bleach field coincide spatially, supersaturated greens are not seen. Since color mixing but not contrast was found binocularly, color contrast must be a retinal phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2030670242,It has been demonstrated in man that mechanically induced shifts of the retinal image without change in total luminous flux evoke a parietooccipital electrical response (lambda waves). The technique provides a simple method of quantifying responses in the visual system without complication by voluntary movemnents and their associated readiness potentials. The observation contradicts the view that lambda waves are directly concerned with mechanisms preventing blur duiring eye movement.
https://openalex.org/W2039904711,Electrophysiological studies of the cerebellar cortex of the frog demonstrate a lack of long-term inhibition upon the Purkinje cells. This lack of inhibition correlates well with the absence of stellate and basket cells in the molecular layer of this cerebellum and strongly supports the idea that these interneurones are the agents responsible for the prolonged inhibition seen in the Purkinje cells of other species.

However, filipin and crude phospholipase C, like thyrotropin, do increase phospholipid formation."
https://openalex.org/W1996153439,Analyses of smokers pulmonary tissues that showed of 210-polonium at segmental bifurcations of bronchial epithelium (4.5 pc/g of wet tissue vs. .12 in the trachea 119 in the lobar bronchi and .004 in the bronchial wall and submucosa) are 100 times higher than some recently reported radiation dose estimates for these areas. However the results of the different studies are compatible when the type and quality of tissues used are taken into consideration. It is emphasized that bronchial epithelium samples deteriorate rapidly after death so they should be obtained quickly. As the concentration of 210-polonium is so much greater at these hot spots than in the bronchial wall and submucosa estimates of radiation dose should be based just on the measured concentrations in the bifurcations.

Hair was then activated by neutron bombardment which showed sodium still present as sodium-24. It is concluded that a fraction of sodium in hair can be readily washed away with water and that a second fraction is held in the hair in such a manner that extended washing does not remove it. This suggests that sodium in two states may be associated with hair, one as an external contaminant and the other as a more nearly integral part of the hair."

https://openalex.org/W4238764378,"From our examination of the relation of behavioral science research to the right to privacy, we have been led to the following conclusions. 1) While most current practices in the field pose no significant threat to the privacy of research subjects, a sufficient number of exceptions have been noted to warrant a sharp increase in attention to procedures that will assure protection of this right. The increasing scale of behavioral research is itself an additional reason for focusing attention in this area. 2) Participation by subjects must be voluntary and based on informed consent to the extent that this is consistent with the objectives of the research. It is fully consistent with the protection of privacy that, in the absence of full information, consent be based on trust in the qualified investigator and the integrity of his institution. 3) The scientist has an obligation to insure that no permanent physical or psychological harm will ensue from the research procedures, and that temporary discomfort or loss of privacy will be remedied in an appropriate way during the course of the research or at its completion. To merit trust, the scientist must design his research with a view to protecting, to the fullest extent possible, the privacy of the subjects. If intrusion on privacy proves essential to the research, he should not proceed with his proposed experiment until he and his colleagues have considered all of the relevant facts and he has determined, with support from them, that the benefits outweigh the costs. 4) The scientist has the same responsibility to protect the privacy of the individual in published reports and in research records that he has in the conduct of the research itself. 5) The primary responsibility for the use of ethical procedures must rest with the individual investigator, but government agencies that support behavioral research should satisfy themselves that the institution which employs the investigator has effectively accepted its responsibility to require that he meet proper ethical standards. 6) Legislation to assure appropriate recognition of the rights of human subjects is neither necessary nor desirable if the scientists and sponsoring institutions fully discharge their responsibilities in accommodating to the claim of privacy. Because of its relative inflexibility, legislation cannot meet the challenge of the subtle and sensitive conflict of values under consideration, nor can it aid in the wise decision making by individuals which is required to assure optimum protection of subjects, together with the fullest effectiveness of research."
