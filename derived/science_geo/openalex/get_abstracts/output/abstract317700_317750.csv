The cloacal protrusion may serve as a convenient external index of androgen, permitting repeated measurement without operation on or killing of the animal."
https://openalex.org/W1980415397,"Self-renewal and differentiation are cardinal features of stem cells. Asymmetric cell division provides one fundamental mechanism by which stem cell self-renewal and differentiation are balanced. A failure of this balance could lead to diseases such as cancer. During asymmetric division of stem cells, factors controlling their self-renewal and differentiation are unequally segregated between daughter cells. Numb is one such factor that is segregated to the differentiating daughter cell during the stem-cell-like neuroblast divisions in Drosophila melanogaster, where it inhibits self-renewal. The localization and function of Numb is cell-cycle-dependent. Here we show that Polo (ref. 13), a key cell cycle regulator, the mammalian counterparts of which have been implicated as oncogenes as well as tumour suppressors, acts as a tumour suppressor in the larval brain. Supernumerary neuroblasts are produced at the expense of neurons in polo mutants. Polo directly phosphorylates Partner of Numb (Pon, ref. 16), an adaptor protein for Numb, and this phosphorylation event is important for Pon to localize Numb. In polo mutants, the asymmetric localization of Pon, Numb and atypical protein kinase C are disrupted, whereas other polarity markers are largely unaffected. Overexpression of Numb suppresses neuroblast overproliferation caused by polo mutations, suggesting that Numb has a major role in mediating this effect of Polo. Our results reveal a biochemical link between the cell cycle and the asymmetric protein localization machinery, and indicate that Polo can inhibit progenitor self-renewal by regulating the localization and function of Numb."
https://openalex.org/W2068788389,Subjects monitored for a visual signal while engaged in a demanding mental task. The probability of detecting the signal depends on the time of its presentation during the 8 seconds of the task. A similar time course is observed for failures to detect and for changes of pupil size. Momentary variations in the load that the task imposes on the subject are reflected in both indices. Detection failures are not explained by the pupillary changes.
https://openalex.org/W2070941721,"Magnetic boundaries parallel the continental slope and separate undisturbed from disturbed magnetic regions on both sides of the North Atlantic. The boundaries lie 2000 to 2500 kilometers from the axis of the mid-Atlantic ridge and roughly equidistant from it. The undisturbed zone, lying on the continental side of the boundaries, may reflect the long period of no reversals in magnetic polarity that occurred during the late Paleozoic."
https://openalex.org/W2071361098,"We have operated an interferometer with independent local oscillators and without any communication link of wide bandwidth between the elements of the interferometer. This makes operation possible at very long base lines because, heretofore, construction of the communications link has been the factor limiting the separation of the elements. In our system, coherence at the two elements is maintained through the use of two highly stable, atomic oscillators. The intermediate-frequency output signals are recorded at each element on a high-speed digital tape recorder. Interference fringes are produced later by cross-correlating the two tape records in a digital computer."
https://openalex.org/W2001146693,Two bipolar neurons are located in a nerve branch connecting the recurrent nerve and foregut of the blowfly Phormia regina. Spike activity accompanying peristalsis or controlled enlargement of the foregut region is recorded from two cells in the recurrent nerve. The spikes are abolished by section of the nerve branch connecting recurrent nerve and foregut. It is concluded that the two neurons are the foregut stretch receptors predicted from results of behavioral experiments and vital to the regulation of feeding by the fly.
https://openalex.org/W1997103326,"In mice fasted for 17 hours, administration of enterogastrone purified from hog duodenum reduced the food intake. This effect was greatest during the first 30 minutes, but the cumulative reduction continued for at least 4 hours. Other peptides prepared from hog duodenum or colon, as well as glucagon, secretin, glucose, and bovine serum albumin, were ineffective."
https://openalex.org/W2057894942,"Responding elicited in the squirrel monkey by electric shocks presented every 60 seconds was gradually altered in temporal patterning, especially when the shock was also produced by responses under a 30-second fixed-interval schedule. The initially elicited pattern of maximal responding just after each shock was altered by the recurrent shock and by the added fixed-interval schedule to a pattern of maximal responding just before each shock. Most shocks were produced by responses and the response pattern was maintained for several months, but little responding occurred when shocks were omitted."

https://openalex.org/W2025693298,"Clicks and flashes that evoke an electrical response from the auditory or visual cortex also evoke a resistance shift in the tissue. The resistance shift, a drop followed by a rise in resistance, closely follows the temporal pattern of the electrical response recorded simultaneously through the same electrodes. While several experimental manipulations produce corresponding changes in the amplitudes of both electrical response and resistance shift, the resistance shift is more sensitive to alterations in cortical temperature and anesthetic level. The two responses behave distinctly differently as a function of the depth of the electrode in the cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2072085028,Thyrocalcitonin content of thyroid gland extracts from normal postparturient cows was 3.9 times greater than in cows with postparturient paresis. The parafollicular cells in diseased cows were less numerous and appeared to have discharged their secretory products. An abrupt release of thyrocalcitonin near parturition may be related to the development of the hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia in this disorder.
https://openalex.org/W1999864705,"Continuous-wave signals transmitted from Lunar Orbiter I have been received on Earth after they have been reflected from the surface of the moon. The frequency spectrum of the reflected signals is used to locate discrete, heterogeneous, scattering centers on the lunar surface. The scattering centers are probably distinguished from the surrounding terrain by a higher surface reflectivity. Continuous-wave bistatic radar could provide an important new method for the study and mapping of planetary surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1996965506,"The feeding of high dietary supplements of L-phenylalanine (7 percent) and L-leucine (7 percent) to weanling rats is associated with poor performance in a multiple-T, water-escape maze. Supplements high in L-tryptophan (5 percent), on the other hand, result in maze performance which is superior to that of controls. Adding 5 percent tryptophan to the high-phenylalanine diet reverses the behavioral deficit. The quality of maze performance correlated with the cerebral content of serotonin."
https://openalex.org/W2018435885,"A series of far-infrared surveys of the sky is searching for thermal radiation from interstellar grains and for other localized sources of far-infrared radiation. A balloon-borne germanium bolometer, cooled by liquid helium, is used in association with a telescope and spectral filters. During two initial flights the response to a black-body source was mainly between 300 and 360 microns. Approximately half the celestial sphere was surveyed, including most of the northern Milky Way. The angular resolution was 2 degrees. Moon was the only source of thermal radiation detected. The upper limit on the differential flux, relative to background, from other sources was 2 x 10(-23) watt per square centimeter per hertz, corresponding to an antenna temperature of 0.6 degrees K in the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation, or 10 degrees K for a black body."

https://openalex.org/W1971697773,Soluble protein from the defective strain PM2 of tobacco mosaic virus can be recognized as antigenically distinct from the protein of the wild-type tobacco mosaic virus by Ouchterlony and immunoelectrophoretic analyses at temperatures below 37 degrees C. At these temperatures a polymerized state of protein with a characteristic antigenic structure is present in the wild-type virus; this structure is absent from the PM2 preparations. Above 37 degrees C the precipitin patterns for tobacco mosaic virus and PM2 appear identical.

When the tube is initially filled with one of the gases, and the mixture surrounds it, the pressure rise is related to the tension of the remaining gas."

https://openalex.org/W1986702716,"The performance of existing linear accelerators has improved dramatically in the last few years as a result of redesign of the injector. The peak beams available surpass in intensity and quality those from other accelerators. Usually the operation has been pulsed, with a low duty factor. However, the recently developed accelerating structures now make it attractive to raise the average beam power by several orders of magnitude. New possibilities are apparent for the use of such beams for research in nuclear physics and other sciences."
