https://openalex.org/W2069483687,"Background Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most prevalent human pathogens, and consist of 101 serotypes that are classified into groups A and B according to sequence variations. HRV infections cause a wide spectrum of clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe lower respiratory symptoms. Defining the role of specific strains in various HRV illnesses has been difficult because traditional serology, which requires viral culture and neutralization tests using 101 serotype-specific antisera, is insensitive and laborious. Methods and Findings To directly type HRVs in nasal secretions of infants with frequent respiratory illnesses, we developed a sensitive molecular typing assay based on phylogenetic comparisons of a 260-bp variable sequence in the 5' noncoding region with homologous sequences of the 101 known serotypes. Nasal samples from 26 infants were first tested with a multiplex PCR assay for respiratory viruses, and HRV was the most common virus found (108 of 181 samples). Typing was completed for 101 samples and 103 HRVs were identified. Surprisingly, 54 (52.4%) HRVs did not match any of the known serotypes and had 12–35% nucleotide divergence from the nearest reference HRVs. Of these novel viruses, 9 strains (17 HRVs) segregated from HRVA, HRVB and human enterovirus into a distinct genetic group (“C”). None of these new strains could be cultured in traditional cell lines. Conclusions By molecular analysis, over 50% of HRV detected in sick infants were previously unrecognized strains, including 9 strains that may represent a new HRV group. These findings indicate that the number of HRV strains is considerably larger than the 101 serotypes identified with traditional diagnostic techniques, and provide evidence of a new HRV group."
https://openalex.org/W2044812530,"Background One of the big roadblocks in development of HIV-1/AIDS vaccines is the enormous diversity of HIV-1, which could limit the value of any HIV-1 vaccine candidate currently under test. Methodology and Findings To address the HIV-1 variation, we designed a novel T cell immunogen, designated HIVCONSV, by assembling the 14 most conserved regions of the HIV-1 proteome into one chimaeric protein. Each segment is a consensus sequence from one of the four major HIV-1 clades A, B, C and D, which alternate to ensure equal clade coverage. The gene coding for the HIVCONSV protein was inserted into the three most studied vaccine vectors, plasmid DNA, human adenovirus serotype 5 and modified vaccine virus Ankara (MVA), and induced HIV-1-specific T cell responses in mice. We also demonstrated that these conserved regions prime CD8+ and CD4+ T cell to highly conserved epitopes in humans and that these epitopes, although usually subdominant, generate memory T cells in patients during natural HIV-1 infection. Significance Therefore, this vaccine approach provides an attractive and testable alternative for overcoming the HIV-1 variability, while focusing T cell responses on regions of the virus that are less likely to mutate and escape. Furthermore, this approach has merit in the simplicity of design and delivery, requiring only a single immunogen to provide extensive coverage of global HIV-1 population diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2031398937,"Trehalose is a compatible osmolyte produced by bacteria, fungi, insects and plants to protect the integrity of cells against various environmental stresses. Spores, the reproductive, survival and infection bodies of fungi require high amounts of trehalose for long-term survival. Here, via a gain-of-function genetic screen, we identify the novel regulator VosA that couples the formation of spores and focal trehalose biogenesis in the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans. The vosA gene is expressed specifically during the formation of both sexual and asexual spores (conidia). Levels of vosA mRNA and protein are high in both types of spore. The deletion of vosA results in the lack of trehalose in spores, a rapid loss of the cytoplasm, organelles and viability of spores, and a dramatic reduction in tolerance of conidia to heat and oxidative stress. Moreover, the absence of vosA causes uncontrolled activation of asexual development, whereas the enhanced expression of vosA blocks sporulation, suggesting that VosA also functions in negative-feedback regulation of sporogenesis. VosA localizes in the nucleus of mature conidia and its C-terminal region contains a potential transcription activation domain, indicating that it may function as a transcription factor primarily controlling the late process of sporulation including trehalose biogenesis. VosA is conserved in most fungi and may define a new fungus-specific transcription factor family."
https://openalex.org/W2033159340,"Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a transcription factor involved in both proliferation and differentiation in the colon. It is down-regulated in both mouse and human colonic adenomas and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in the gut, whereas in breast cancer, KLF4 is an oncogene. KLF4 is also involved in reprogramming differentiated cells into pluripotent stem cells. KLF4 can act as a transcriptional activator or repressor, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We found that p300, a CREB-binding protein-related protein, interacts with KLF4 both in vitro and in vivo and activates transcription. We further made the novel observation that endogenous KLF4 is acetylated by p300/CBP in vivo and that mutations of the acetylated lysines resulted in a decreased ability of KLF4 to activate target genes, suggesting that acetylation is important for KLF4-mediated transactivation. Furthermore, we found that KLF4 differentially modulates histone H4 acetylation at the promoters of target genes. Co-transfection of KLF4 and HDAC3 resulted in a synergistic repression of a cyclin B(1) reporter construct. Our results suggest that KLF4 might function as an activator or repressor of transcription depending on whether it interacts with co-activators such as p300 and CREB-binding protein or co-repressors such as HDAC3."
https://openalex.org/W2053328915,"γ-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease complex that cleaves type I integral membrane proteins, including the amyloid β-protein precursor and the Notch receptor, and is composed of presenilin, Pen-2, nicastrin, and Aph-1. Although all four of these membrane proteins are essential for assembly and activity, the stoichiometry of the complex is unknown, with the number of presenilin molecules present being especially controversial. Here we analyze functional γ-secretase complexes, isolated by immunoprecipitation from solubilized membrane fractions and able to produce amyloid β-peptides and amyloid β-protein precursor intracellular domain. We show that the active isolated protease contains only one presenilin per complex, which excludes certain models of the active site that require aspartate dyads formed between two presenilin molecules. We also quantified components in the isolated complexes by Western blot using protein standards and found that the amounts of Pen-2 and nicastrin were the same as that of presenilin. Moreover, we found that one Aph-1 was not co-immunoprecipitated with another in active complexes, evidence that Aph-1 is likewise present as a monomer. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the stoichiometry of γ-components presenilin:Pen-2:nicastrin:Aph-1 is 1:1:1:1. γ-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease complex that cleaves type I integral membrane proteins, including the amyloid β-protein precursor and the Notch receptor, and is composed of presenilin, Pen-2, nicastrin, and Aph-1.

Although the essential components of γ-secretase were all known by 2003, the stoichiometry of the complex remains unknown. Some evidence suggests that two PS molecules reside in a single protease complex, leading to the suggestion that a PS dimer is at the catalytic core of γ-secretase and/or that substrates are cleaved at the dimer interface (9Schroeter E.H.

How these findings relate to results from native gel electrophoresis analysis and the critical importance of detergents is also discussed.

Quantification of γ-Components—γ-Secretase was immunoprecipitated from solubilized membrane fractions of DKO cells expressing Myc- and HA-tagged wt PS1 or HEK293 cells expressing endogenous PS1 with mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody or rat monoclonal PS1 antibody (Millipore). The immunoprecipitated Myc-PS1 was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10–20% Tricine gel (Invitrogen)) and Western blot and then quantified with rabbit polyclonal anti-Myc antibody (Sigma) by using N-terminally Myc-tagged ubiquitin (Boston Biochem) to generate a standard curve. To quantify the immunoprecipitated wt PS1 from HEK293 cells, the different amounts of quantified Myc-PS1 were further used as a standard curve and detected with AB14. To quantify co-immunoprecipitated endogenous Pen-2, different amounts of FLAG-Pen-2 immunoprecipitated from digitonin solubilized membrane fractions of S-1 cells (38Fraering P.C. LaVoie M.J. Ye W. Ostaszewski B.L. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) were quantified by using FLAG-tagged ubiquitin (Boston Biochem) as a standard curve with M2 antibody. The various quantified FLAG-Pen-2 samples were next used as standards to quantify endogenous Pen-2 with rabbit polyclonal ab24743 (Abcam). To quantify co-immunoprecipitated endogenous NCT, different amounts of NCT-GST immunoprecipitated from solubilized membrane fractions of S-1 cells (38Fraering P.C. LaVoie M.J. Ye W. Ostaszewski B.L. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) were quantified by using GST-E1 (Boston Biochem) to generate a standard curve with rabbit polyclonal GST antibody (Invitrogen). The quantified NCT-GST samples were next used as standards to quantify endogenous NCT with rabbit polyclonal anti-NCT. Software, ImageJ, was used to quantify the intensity of immunoblot signals. To determine whether two PS molecules are present in a single γ-secretase complex, we stably expressed two different and distinquishable forms of PS1 in cells. One FAD mutant form of PS1, ΔE9 (deletion of exon 9), does not undergo endoproteolysis into NTF and CTF and can be readily discriminated against wt PS1 by Western blot (39Ratovitski T. Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Borchelt D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24536-24541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We transfected His-FLAG-ΔE9 (or its aspartyl mutants TM6DC and TM7DC, in which the active site aspartates of transmembrane domains 6 and 7, respectively, are mutated to cysteine) into γ-30 cells. γ-30 cells are CHO cells that stably express human proteins APP, wt PS1, FLAG-Pen-2, and Aph-1a-HA (17Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6382-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Thus, the transfected γ-30 cells stably express both His-FLAG-ΔE9 and untagged wt PS1 (γ-30 +ΔE9 cells). The membrane fractions of these cells were solubilized with the zwitterionic detergent CHAPSO, and IPs were performed with anti-His antibodies. After washing the resultant pellets, we analyzed PS1 and other members of the complexes by Western blot. Although the parent cell line γ-30 does not express any His-tagged proteins, wt PS1 and NCT were pulled down with anti-His antibody and protein G beads (supplemental Fig. S1A), as was active γ-secretase (supplemental Fig. S1B), suggesting that γ-secretase in CHAPSO-solubilized membrane fractions strongly binds to beads nonspecifically and that CHAPSO, commonly used in the study of γ-secretase, is not an appropriate detergent for evaluating the stoichiometry of the complex. We then identified digitonin as a detergent that eliminates the nonspecific binding but conserves activity. When HA-tagged Aph-1a of γ-30 cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, all components of the complex were co-immunoprecipitated, whereas anti-His antibody did not pull down any (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3; a small amount of Aph-1a-HA is brought down, probably because of the highly hydrophobic nature of this protein). On the other hand, when His-tagged ΔE9 was immunoprecipitated from γ-30 +ΔE9 cell membranes with anti-His antibody, all of the other components co-immunoprecipitated, but wt PS1 (as NTF and CTF) did not (Fig. 1A, lane 5). Catalytically inactive PS ΔE9 mutants TM6DC and TM7DC likewise assembled into full, mature complexes pulled down by anti-His antibodies but without wt PS1 NTF or CTF co-immunoprecipitating (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 9). To reconstitute the activity, the resultant pellets were washed and resuspended in 0.25% CHAPSO containing 0.1% phosphatidylcholine and APP-based recombinant substrate C100FLAG (25Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Diehl T.S. Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, immunoprecipitated γ-secretase regained activity and produced Aβ and AICD (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that γ-secretase remained intact during the IP. A very small portion of nonspecific background activity was observed (i.e. immunoprecipitated from parent γ-30 cells with anti-His antibody; Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4), barely above that seen with catalytically inactive negative controls, ΔE9/TM6DC and ΔE9/TM7DC (lanes 7–10). γ-Secretase containing wt PS1 produced both longer and shorter Aβ species (lanes 1–2), whereas protease complexes containing ΔE9 produced mainly longer Aβ variants (lanes 5–6) that were not recognized by the C-terminal-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Fig. 1C), suggesting that these Aβ species are not 40- or 42-residue Aβ (Aβ40 or Aβ42). The Aβ species so produced were immunoprecipitated with 6E10 and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Whereas the Aβ species produced by wt PS1 ranged from Aβ38 to Aβ45, ΔE9 produced mainly Aβ43 with small portions of Aβ45 and Aβ46 (Fig. 1D), indicating that the upper band contains species of Aβ43 and longer. ΔE9 can produce small amounts of shorter Aβ species (see Fig. 3B, lane 8); however, overall activity was much lower than wt PS. These observations are consistent with previous reports that FAD PS mutants, including ΔE9, cleave substrates less efficiently and generate longer forms of Aβ (40Nakaya Y. Yamane T. Shiraishi H.

We confirmed the above findings by carrying out the reverse experiment, pulling down wt PS1 using a different antibody, B17, which recognizes wt PS1 but not ΔE9 (26De Strooper B. Beullens M. Contreras B. Levesque L. Craessaerts K. Cordell B. Moechars D. Bollen M. Fraser P. George-Hyslop P.S. Van Leuven F. J. Biol.

Although wt PS1 CTF was detected with B17, ΔE9 was not, even when concentrated by IP (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). IP of γ-complexes containing wt PS1 with this antibody did not bring down any ΔE9 (Fig. 2B), indicating that none of the isolated complexes contained PS-PS dimers of wt PS1 and ΔE9. In digitonin-solubilized membrane fractions, blue native gel showed full γ-complexes containing PS1 and NCT with mobilities of ∼500 kDa (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–4), although note that γ-complexes in CHAPSO-solubilized membrane fractions have slower mobilities (lanes 5–6). These observations are consistent with previous reports (16Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One is sufficient for an active γ-secretase complex. These findings were elicited by using wt PS1 and ΔE9; however, these two PS variants may not interact because of their differences. wt PS1 undergoes endoproteolysis, and ΔE9 does not. To further investigate the possibility of a PS-PS interaction within γ-complexes, we co-expressed Myc-tagged PS1 and"

The specificity of the translation apparatus, however, limits the diversity of unnatural amino acids that can be incorporated into peptides by ribosomal translation. We have previously shown that over 90 unnatural amino acids can be enzymatically loaded onto tRNA.We have now used a competition assay to assess the efficiency of tRNA-aminoacylation of these analogs. We have also used a series of peptide translation assays to measure the efficiency with which these analogs are incorporated into peptides. The translation apparatus tolerates most side chain derivatives, a few alpha,alpha disubstituted, N-methyl and alpha-hydroxy derivatives, but no beta-amino acids. We show that over 50 unnatural amino acids can be incorporated into peptides by ribosomal translation. Using a set of analogs that are efficiently charged and translated we were able to prepare individual peptides containing up to 13 different unnatural amino acids.Our results demonstrate that a diverse array of unnatural building blocks can be translationally incorporated into peptides. These building blocks provide new opportunities for in vitro selections with highly modified drug-like peptides."

These fragments were cloned into pFlagTEM-1 to generate constructs encoding FliC1–495::FT, FliC1–35::FT, FliC1–48::FT, or FT::FliC270–495. To express untagged FliC protein under control of the Trc promoter, fliC was amplified with NdeI/SalI extensions and cloned into pFlagTEM-1 digested with NdeI and XhoI. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Isolation of Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages—Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated from C57BL/6 following standard protocols. Briefly, after aseptically obtaining femurs from the mice, the bone marrow cells were flushed out with 6 ml of cold RPMI 1690 medium (RPMI, Invitrogen). Cells were pelleted at 1,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, L-cell conditioned medium, 1 mm glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen) and placed in Petri dishes at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At day 3, cells were fed by adding 10 ml of medium and incubated for an additional 5 days in the presence of CO2. BMDMs were harvested at day 7 by treatment with trypsin and washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Macrophages were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, resuspended in RPMIsup (RPMI supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1 mm glutamine, and 1% nonessential amino acids), and counted for the infection assays. Infection of Macrophages with Salmonella—For macrophage cytotoxicity and IL-1β assays, 96-well microtiter dishes were seeded with BMDMs at a concentration of 4 × 104 cells/well in 0.2 ml of RPMIsup and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The macrophages used for IL-1β secretion were treated with 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (E. coli 055:B5, Sigma) for 4 h before infection. Macrophages were infected with 20 bacteria per cell by centrifuging at 250 × g for 5 min at room temperature to synchronize infection. Cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and free bacteria were removed by three washes with PBS. RPMIsup plus 1 mm IPTG and 100 μgof gentamicin/ml were added to the macrophages for the duration of infection. Assay of β-Lactamase—To demonstrate the translocation of TEM-1 fusion proteins, J774A.1 mouse macrophages were seeded in 96-well coverglass bottom plates and infected with S. Typhimurium strains expressing β-lactamase fusion proteins at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Plates were centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min at room temperature to synchronize infection. After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2, free bacteria were removed from the cells by three washes with PBS. 0.2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1 mm glutamine containing 1 mm IPTG and 100 μg/ml gentamicin were added to each well, and plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 3 h, cells were washed once with Hank's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and loaded with the fluorescent substrate CCF2/AM (1 mm, Invitrogen) for 1.5 h at room temperature using the standard loading protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Fluorescence microscopy analysis was performed using an Axiovert M200 (Carl Zeiss), equipped with a CCF2 filter set (Chroma Technology). Fluorescence micrographs were captured using a Zeiss Axiocam MRC5 and Zeiss AxioVision 4.5 software. Images were imported into Adobe PhotoShop for color adjustment. Quantification of Flagellin Translocation by Flow Cytometry—J774A.1 macrophages were infected with mid-logarithmic phase S. Typhimurium as described above. Cells were washed and loaded with CCF2/AM using the manufacturer's standard loading protocol for 1.5 h. After another wash with PBS, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were collected from each well in 1 ml of PBS with a cell scraper. Data were acquired using an LSRII (Becton Dickinson), using 407 nm as excitation wavelength and bandpass filters 450/50 for detection of Cascade Blue and 545/60 for detection of AmCyan. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc). Western Blot—After growing bacteria to mid-log phase, 1 mm IPTG was added for an additional 2 h to induce fliC expression. Bacterial supernatants were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer. Bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The total protein equivalent to 1 × 107 colony-forming units or 1 ml of culture supernatant was loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting. FliC was detected using Salmonella Hi antiserum and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). FliC::FLAG-TEM-1 fusions were detected using anti-FLAG monocolonal antibody (1:5000, Sigma). Primary antibody binding was detected using a goat anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to HRP. HRP activity was detected with a chemiluminescent substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Macrophage Cytotoxicity—The percentage of BMDMs death was determined by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release at 1 and 4 h after infection using the CytoTox 96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) following instructions provided by the manufacturer. Measurement of IL-1β Secretion—IL-1β was measured in culture supernatants of infected BMDMs using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (e-Bioscience, San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Macrophages were primed with lipopolysaccharide as described above, and supernatants were collected 24 h after infection. Although the inability of Salmonella flagellin mutants to activate the inflammasome provides indirect evidence for translocation of flagellin into the host cell cytosol during infection, flagellin has not yet been detected directly in the cytosol of infected cells. To detect this translocation event occurring during infection, we employed a β-lactamase reporter system utilized previously by our group to visualize translocation of the Salmonella Typhi Type III secretion effector SipA (26Raffatellu M. Chessa D. Wilson R.P. Dusold R. Rubino S. Baumler A.J. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 3367-3374Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we expressed S. Typhimurium FliC from a derivative of the broad host range plasmid pBBR1MCS, pFlagTEM-1, in which fliC is expressed from the Trc promoter. To determine whether the level of flagellin expressed from this medium copy number construct is similar to expression from wild type S. Typhimurium, we assayed expression of FliC by Western blot. The expression level of FliC in S. Typhimurium carrying the plasmid-encoded flagellin construct was similar to expression in wild type S. Typhimurium carrying the empty vector (Fig. 1A). This level of expression was sufficient to trigger formation of inflammasomes upon infection of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages since the strains expressing flagellin induced pyroptosis, or an inflammatory cell death, as evidenced by secretion of IL-1β and release of LDH (Fig. 1, B and C). An S. Typhimurium fliCfljB mutant, which does not express either of the two flagellins, elicited neither IL-1β release nor cell death, consistent with earlier reports that flagellin expression is required for these cellular responses to Salmonella infection (2Franchi L. Amer A. Body-Malapel M. Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Jagirdar R. Inohara N. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E.P. Nunez G. Nat.

Immunol. 2006; 7: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). We next expressed S. Typhimurium flagellin from the same promoter, with TEM-1 β-lactamase fused to its C terminus. By loading S. Typhimurium-infected macrophages with the cell-permeable β-lactamase substrate CCF2/AM (28Zlokarnik G. Negulescu P.A. Knapp T.E. Mere L. Burres N. Feng L. Whitney M. Roemer K. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 279: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), cytosolic FliC::TEM-1 fusion protein can be detected. Cleavage of CCF2 by the β-lactamase reporter results in a shift in the fluorescence emission maximum from 520 (green) to 447 nm (blue) so that cells in which cytosolic translocation of FliC has occurred appear blue by fluorescence microscopy. At 4 h after infection of macrophages, a fusion of the full-length FliC protein to TEM-1 (FliC1–495::FT) could be detected in the cytosol of 77.5% of infected macrophages (Fig. 2A). This translocation was dependent on the SPI-1 T3SS as an invA mutant defective in the T3SS did not translocate the FliC1–495::FT fusion. Translocation was reduced but not abolished in a flgB mutant defective in the flagellar basal body, showing that the flagellar T3SS is not required for translocation of flagellin into the cytosol of infected cells. The number of cells containing translocated flagellin was similar to the number found for the SPI-1 T3SS effector SipA (Fig. 2A). It has been shown that the N terminus of FliC is required for its secretion and assembly into the flagellar structure (29Kuwajima G. Kawagishi I. Homma M. Asaka J. Kondo E. Macnab R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4953-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The first 48 amino acids are sufficient for secretion of FliC into Salmonella culture supernatants (30Vegh B.M. Gal P. Dobo J. Zavodszky P. Vonderviszt F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the FliC secretion domain is sufficient for its translocation into infected host cells. Fusions of the first 35 (FliC1–35::FT) or 48 (FliC1–48::FT) N-terminal amino acids of FliC to TEM-1 were sufficient for secretion into the supernatant of S. Typhimurium cultures (Fig. 2B). Inactivation of the SPI-1 T3SS by an invA mutation did not abolish secretion either of the full-length FliC fused to TEM-1 or of the N-terminal fusions of FliC to TEM-1, although the amount of protein in the supernatant was reduced (Fig. 2B). Inactivation of the flagellar T3SS by mutation of flgB, encoding a component of the basal body rod structure, also reduced, but did not abrogate, secretion of the N-terminal fusions of FliC to TEM-1. The reduction in FliC::FT translocation observed cells infected with the flgB mutant may be due to overexpression of chromosomally encoded flagellin in the flgB mutant (data not shown), which competes with the FliC::FT fusion protein for secretion (Fig. 2A). A fusion of the C-terminal 225 amino acids of FliC to the C terminus of TEM-1 (FliC270–495::FT) was expressed in S. Typhimurium but secreted in small amounts by the invA mutant. As expected, secretion of the SPI-1 T3SS effector SipA was eliminated by the invA mutation but not by the flgB mutation. These results show that either a functional SPI-1 T3SS or a functional flagellar T3SS is sufficient for secretion of N-terminal fusions of FliC in liquid cultures. Although FliC1–35::FT and FliC1–48::FT were secreted to the culture supernatant, these domains did not mediate wild type levels of flagellin translocation into host cells (Fig. 2C). FliC1–48 mediated a low level of translocation of the TEM-1 reporter that was 3% of the level observed with full-length flagellin. FliC270–495, containing the binding site for the flagellar chaperone FliS (31Auvray F. Thomas J. Fraser G.M. Hughes C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), did not mediate translocation. These results suggest that domains of FliC in addition to the N-terminal secretion signal are required for translocation into the host cell. Activation of caspase-1 and pyroptotic cell death in S. Typhimurium-infected macrophages has been shown to depend on Ipaf and ASC (32Mariathasan S. Newton K. Monack D.M. Vucic D. French D.M. Lee W.P. Roose-Girma M. Erickson S. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that S. Typhimurium mutants lacking flagellin fail to activate this pathway and do not cause cell death (2Franchi L. Amer A. Body-Malapel M. Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Jagirdar R. Inohara N. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E.P. Nunez G. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 4Miao E.A. Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Dors M. Clark A.E. Bader M.W. Miller S.I. Aderem A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). In addition to flagellin, activation of the inflammasome also required a functional SPI-1 T3SS, suggesting that flagellin is secreted into the cytosol by this system (4Miao E.A. Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Dors M. Clark A.E. Bader M.W. Miller S.I. Aderem A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). However, it has not been demonstrated that flagellin is actually translocated from the vacuole containing Salmonella into the host cell cytosol. Therefore, the translocation of flagellin into the cytosol of Salmonella-infected cells shown here provides an important link between the data obtained with bacterial flagellin mutants and results obtained with macrophages from Ipaf–/– and ASC–/– mutant mice that show a reduced responsiveness to flagellin delivered to the cytosol via transfection reagents (2Franchi L. Amer A. Body-Malapel M. Kanneganti T.D. Ozoren N. Jagirdar R. Inohara N. Vandenabeele P. Bertin J. Coyle A. Grant E.P. Nunez G. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 4Miao E.A. Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Dors M. Clark A.E. Bader M.W. Miller S.I. Aderem A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Thus, this proinflammatory mechanism may have important consequences for in vivo infection, for example, by preventing systemic spread of Salmonella from the intestine. Caspase-1–/– mice exhibited reduced survival after oral infection with S. Typhimurium, and ASC–/– and Ipaf–/– mice had slightly higher systemic spread to the lymph nodes from the intestine (33Lara-Tejero M. Sutterwala F.S. Ogura Y. Grant E.P. Bertin J. Coyle A.J. Flavell R.A. Galan J.E. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 1407-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of the inflammasome by cytosolic flagellin may have important implications for responses to invasive bacteria. In mice, S. Typhimurium was found in CD11c+ dendritic cells in the lamina propria (10Uematsu S. Jang M.H. Chevrier N. Guo Z. Kumagai Y. Yamamoto M. Kato H. Sougawa N. Matsui H. Kuwata H. Hemmi H. Coban C. Kawai T. Ishii K.J. Takeuchi O. Miyasaka M. Takeda K. Akira S. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Since S. Typhimurium induces caspase-1-dependent apoptosis of dendritic cells via the SPI-1 T3SS, these cells may sense cytosolic flagellin translocation by Salmonella and trigger proinflammatory responses (34van der Velden A.W. Velasquez M. Starnbach M.N. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6742-6749Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The Peyer's patches of the ileum and the lamina propria would appear to be the most likely anatomical site for sensing of cytosolic flagellin since S. Typhimurium represses flagellin expression at systemic sites such as the mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen (35Cummings L.A. Barrett S.L. Wilkerson W.D. Fellnerova I. Cookson B.T. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7929-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Cummings L.A. Wilkerson W.D. Bergsbaken T. Cookson B.T. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 795-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The results of our study reveal mechanistic details of FliC egress into the cytosol of infected cells. The SPI-1 T3SS was absolutely required for localization of flagellin to the cytosol, whereas no strict requirement of the flagellar T3SS was observed (Fig. 2). These findings are consistent with those of Miao et al.(4Miao E.A. Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Dors M. Clark A.E. Bader M.W. Miller S.I. Aderem A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar), who tested a large number of mutants with specific defects in the flagellar apparatus for their cytotoxicity in macrophages. These investigators found that mutants lacking a functional flagellar apparatus were able to trigger cytotoxicity and IL-1β secretion when flagellin was expressed ectopically (4Miao E.A. Alpuche-Aranda C.M. Dors M. Clark A.E. Bader M.W. Miller S.I. Aderem A. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Further, the inability of secretion-competent fusions of flagellin to TEM-1 β-lactamase to be translocated into infected cells (Fig. 2) argues against the idea that flagellin may be secreted into the vacuole containing Salmonella and then leak nonspecifically through holes in the vacuole created by the SPI-1 T3SS. Rather, the requirement for additional sequences beyond the secretion signal for cytosolic translocation is similar to what has been observed for some T3SS effectors that are injected into the host cell. For the Salmonella T3SS effector SspH2, translocation into host cells required the N-terminal 143 amino acids, which includes two domains conserved among a group of translocated effectors (37Miao E.A. Miller S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7539-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Similarly, for the Yersinia T3SS effectors YopE and YopH, the N-terminal domain required for translocation (50 or 71 amino acids) was longer than that required for secretion into culture supernatants (15 or 17 amino acids) (38Sory M.P. Boland A. Lambermont I. Cornelis G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11998-12002Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A previous report has described the release of flagellin into cells by a different mechanism. Gewirtz and colleagues (39Lyons S. Wang L. Casanova J.E. Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. Gewirtz A.T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5771-5780Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed that S. Typhimurium colonizing the apical side of epithelial monolayers is able to mediate flagellin transcytosis to the basolaterial aspect. The translocation of flagellin into the macrophage cytosol observed by these investigators is mechanistically distinct from the cytosolic translocation of flagellin reported here since in the previous study, flagellin was localized to membrane-bound vacuoles rather then being free in the cytosol. Further, flagellin transcytosis was dependent on a third T3SS, encoded on Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2 T3SS), and was independent of the SPI-1 T3SS (39Lyons S. Wang L. Casanova J.E. Sitaraman S.V. Merlin D. Gewirtz A.T. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5771-5780Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results show that flagellin interacts with the innate immune system at multiple levels to induce proinflammatory responses during Salmonella infection.

https://openalex.org/W2110371871,"Background Short linear motifs (SLiMs) in proteins are functional microdomains of fundamental importance in many biological systems. SLiMs typically consist of a 3 to 10 amino acid stretch of the primary protein sequence, of which as few as two sites may be important for activity, making identification of novel SLiMs extremely difficult. In particular, it can be very difficult to distinguish a randomly recurring “motif” from a truly over-represented one. Incorporating ambiguous amino acid positions and/or variable-length wildcard spacers between defined residues further complicates the matter. Methodology/Principal Findings In this paper we present two algorithms. SLiMBuild identifies convergently evolved, short motifs in a dataset of proteins. Motifs are built by combining dimers into longer patterns, retaining only those motifs occurring in a sufficient number of unrelated proteins. Motifs with fixed amino acid positions are identified and then combined to incorporate amino acid ambiguity and variable-length wildcard spacers. The algorithm is computationally efficient compared to alternatives, particularly when datasets include homologous proteins, and provides great flexibility in the nature of motifs returned. The SLiMChance algorithm estimates the probability of returned motifs arising by chance, correcting for the size and composition of the dataset, and assigns a significance value to each motif. These algorithms are implemented in a software package, SLiMFinder. SLiMFinder default settings identify known SLiMs with 100% specificity, and have a low false discovery rate on random test data. Conclusions/Significance The efficiency of SLiMBuild and low false discovery rate of SLiMChance make SLiMFinder highly suited to high throughput motif discovery and individual high quality analyses alike. Examples of such analyses on real biological data, and how SLiMFinder results can help direct future discoveries, are provided.

VEGF induces phosphorylation of forkhead transcription factors (e.g. FKHR), resulting in their nuclear exclusion and transcriptional inactivation (19Abid M.R. Guo S. Minami T. Spokes K.C. Ueki K.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have long been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes (reviewed in Ref. 20Li J.M. Shah A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: R1014-R1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a growing appreciation for the role of ROS in physiological signaling in many cell types, including endothelial cells. NADPH oxidase is the primary source of superoxide in endothelial cells (21Abid M.R. Kachra Z. Spokes K.C. Aird W.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C.

NADPH oxidase was originally identified and characterized in phagocytes, where it contributes to host defense. The NADPH oxidase complex consists of two membrane-bound components, gp91phox (also known as Nox2) and p22phox, and several cytosolic regulatory subunits, including p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, and the small GTPase Rac (Rac1 or Rac2). Upon enzyme activation, the cytoplasmic units translocate to the cell membrane where they are assembled with gp91phox/p22phox. The resulting multisubunit complex transfers electrons from NAD(P)H to molecular oxygen. Each of the components of the neutrophil NADPH complex has been identified in endothelial cells (25Jones S.A.

First, it is pre-assembled and displays constitutive low level activity. Second, agonist-mediated stimulation of NADPH oxidase results in slower and less potent activation of the enzyme (22Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Third, the enzyme complex is localized in the perinuclear region of endothelial cells and produces an intracellular influx of ROS (30Li J.M. Shah A.M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: S221-S226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Li J.M. Shah A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12094-12100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).

Activation of NADPH oxidase is mediated by post-translational modification and/or increased transcription of the regulatory subunits. We previously reported that VEGF induces NADPH oxidase activity and that NADPH oxidase activity is required for VEGF-mediated migration and proliferation of endothelial cells (21Abid M.R. Kachra Z. Spokes K.C. Aird W.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 22Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed and expanded upon by other groups. For example, PI3K and Rac1 were shown to be required for the VEGF-dependent oxidative burst in porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing VEGFR2/KDR (23Colavitti R. Pani G. Bedogni B. Anzevino R. Borrello S. Waltenberger J. Galeotti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3101-3108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Ushio-Fukai et al. (24Ushio-Fukai M. Tang Y. Fukai T. Dikalov S.I. Ma Y. Fujimoto M. Quinn M.T. Pagano P.J. Johnson C. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) demonstrated an important role for gp91phox in mediating the effect of VEGF on endothelial cell migration and proliferation in vitro and in promoting angiogenesis in a mouse sponge implant model. Similar findings were observed in a hindlimb ischemia model (43Tojo T. Ushio-Fukai M. Yamaoka-Tojo M. Ikeda S. Patrushev N. Alexander R.W. Circulation. 2005; 111: 2347-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS are required for VEGF stimulation of manganese superoxide dismutase, activation of NF-κB, and inactivation of FKHR in endothelial cells (44Abid M.R. Schoots I.G. Spokes K.C. Wu S.Q. Mawhinney C. Aird W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44030-44038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which NADPH oxidase-derived ROS influence VEGF are poorly understood. ROS may result in oxidation of cysteine residues on receptor and nonreceptor protein kinases and phosphatases. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated a role for ROS in VEGFR2 autophosphorylation (23Colavitti R. Pani G. Bedogni B. Anzevino R. Borrello S. Waltenberger J. Galeotti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3101-3108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 24Ushio-Fukai M. Tang Y. Fukai T. Dikalov S.I. Ma Y. Fujimoto M. Quinn M.T. Pagano P.J. Johnson C. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1160-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Here, we show that NADPH oxidase activity is required for some, but not all, downstream effects of VEGF in endothelial cells. These data argue against a global sensitivity of VEGF signal transduction pathways to the redox state of the cell, and suggest that therapeutic modulation of ROS will selectively influence the effect of VEGF on endothelial cell phenotypes. Cell Culture and Reagents—Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from Clonetics and grown in Endothelial Growth Medium-2-MV (EGM-2-MV) BulletKit (Clonetics, San Diego) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Endothelial cells from passage 3 to 6 were used for all experiments. Cells were serum-starved in 0.5% fetal bovine serum for 12-16 h prior to treatment with 50 ng/ml human VEGF-A165 (PeproTech Inc, Rocky Hill, NJ). Where indicated, cells were preincubated for 30 min with 100 nmol/liter l-NAME (Calbiochem), 50 μmol/liter LY294002 (Calbiochem), 50 μmol/liter PD98059 (Calbiochem), or 10 μmol/liter SB203580 (Calbiochem). Phenazine methosulfate and S2366 were from Calbiochem. Inhibition of NADPH Oxidase Activity by Targeting Endogenous p47phox—HCAEC and HUVEC were grown to 70-80% confluence in 6-cm plates and transfected with 100 nm p47phox antisense oligonucleotide (5′-TTTGTCTGGTTGTGTGTGGG-3′; Sequitur, Natick, MA), scrambled antisense (Scram-AS), siRNA against p47phox (5′-GGUCAUUCACAAGCUCCUGtt-3′, Ambion, Austin, TX), or scrambled siRNA (Scramsi) in Opti-MEM containing 10 μg/ml Lipofectin (Invitrogen) for 4 h. The cells were then incubated in EGM-2-MV medium for 24 h and serum-starved in endothelial basal medium (EBM-2; Clonetics) containing 0.5% serum for 12-16 h prior to VEGF treatment. HP-validated siRNA against Src (catalog number SI02223928) and FAK (catalog number SI00287791) kinases were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). ON-TARGETplus si-RNA against PLCγ-1 was from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Assay for NADPH Oxidase Activity in HCAEC and HUVEC—HCAEC and HUVEC were washed with ice-cold PBS, collected by a cell scraper, and Dounce-homogenized in buffer containing 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 1× protease mixture inhibitor (Sigma), 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Calbiochem), 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin (Sigma), and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem). NADPH oxidase activity of the cell lysate was measured using a modified assay (45Griendling K.K. Minieri C.A. Ollerenshaw J.D. Alexander R.W. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2411) Google Scholar). Briefly, photon emission from the chromogenic substrate lucigenin as a function of acceptance of electron/O2 generated by the NADPH oxidase complex was measured every 15 s for 20 min in a Berthold luminometer. NADPH oxidase assay buffer containing 250 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4(7H2O), 1.75 mm CaCl2(2H2O), 11 mm glucose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 μm NADH and 5 μm lucigenin was used. The data were converted to relative light units/min/mg of protein, using a standard curve generated with xanthine/xanthine oxidase. Lucigenin activity (light units/min/mg of protein) of control cells (Scram-AS-transfected) was arbitrarily set at 100%. Total intracellular levels of ROS were determined by FACS analyses of the oxidative conversion of cell-permeable 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA; Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) to fluorescent dichlorofluorescein as described previously (22Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis of Gene Expression—The transcriptional profile of control or VEGF-treated HCAEC with siRNA against p47phox was characterized by oligonucleotide microarray analysis using the human U133A Affymetrix GeneChip, according to previously described protocols for total RNA extraction and purification, cDNA synthesis, in vitro transcription reaction for production of biotin-labeled cRNA, hybridization of cRNA with U133A Affymetrix gene chips, scanning of image output files, analysis of gene expression data, and hierarchical and functional clustering algorithms (46Wada Y. Otu H. Wu S. Abid M.R. Okada H. Libermann T. Kodama T. Shih S.C. Minami T. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1914-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The scanned array images were analyzed by dChip (47Barash Y. Dehan E. Krupsky M. Franklin W. Geraci M. Friedman N. Kaminski N. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2004; 20: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the dChip analysis a smoothing spline normalization method was applied prior to obtaining model-based gene expression indices, also known as signal values. There were no outliers identified by dChip so all samples were carried out for subsequent analysis. When comparing two samples (groups) to identify the genes enriched in a given phenotype, we used the lower confidence bound (LCB) of the fold change between the experiment and the base line. If the 90% LCB of the fold change between the experiment and the base line was above 1.2, the corresponding gene was considered to be differentially expressed. An LCB of >1.2 typically corresponds with an “actual” fold change of at least 3 in gene expression. GOTree machine was used to identify gene ontology categories for the input gene set (48Zhang J.J. Bledsoe G. Kato K. Chao L. Chao J. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 722-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Quantitative Real Time PCR—Real time PCR was carried out as described previously (49Abid M.R. Shih S.C. Otu H.H. Spokes K.C. Okada Y. Curiel D.T. Minami T. Aird W.C. J. Biol.

Briefly, total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy RNA extraction kit with DNase-I treatment following the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). To generate cDNA, total RNA (100 ng) from each of triplicate samples was converted into cDNA using random primers and SuperscriptIII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). All cDNA samples were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. Primers were designed using the Primer Express oligo design software (Applied BioSystems, Foster City, CA) and synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). All primer sets were subjected to rigorous data base searches to identify potential conflicting transcript matches to pseudogenes or homologous domains within related genes. Amplicons generated from the primer set were analyzed for melting point temperatures using the first derivative primer melting curve software supplied by Applied BioSystems. The SYBR Green I assay and the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system were used for detecting real time PCR products from the reverse-transcribed cDNA samples, as described previously (50Shih S.C. Robinson G.S. Perruzzi C.A. Calvo A. Desai K. Green J.E. Ali I.U. Smith L.E. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 35-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). 18 S rRNA, which exhibits a constant expression level across all the HCAEC samples, was used as the normalizer. PCRs for each sample were performed in duplicate, and copy numbers were measured as described previously (50Shih S.C. Robinson G.S. Perruzzi C.A. Calvo A. Desai K. Green J.E. Ali I.U. Smith L.E. Senger D.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 35-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The level of target gene expression was normalized against the 18 S rRNA expression in each sample, and the data were presented as mRNA copies per 106 18 S rRNA copies. Adenoviruses—HCAEC were transduced with replication-deficient adenoviruses encoding the cDNAs of β-galactosidase (Adv), triple mutant (TM)-FKHR (49Abid M.R. Shih S.C. Otu H.H. Spokes K.C. Okada Y.

The triple mutant version of FKHR contains T24A, S256A, and S319A and is resistant to agonist-induced phosphorylation. Western and Northern Blot Analyses—HCAEC were harvested for total protein, and Western blots were carried out as described previously (19Abid M.R. Guo S. Minami T. Spokes K.C. Ueki K. Skurk C. Walsh K. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Anti-Akt, anti-FKHR, anti-p38, anti-VEGFR2, anti-PLCγ-1, and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies and phosphospecific antibodies against Ser-256 FKHR, Ser-473 Akt, ERK1/2, JNK, p38 MAPK, Src, FAK, PLCγ-1, Tyr-951 VEGFR2, and Tyr-1175 VEGFR2 were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Anti-β-actin antibodies were from Sigma. Western blots were performed in triplicates using cell extracts prepared from three independent experiments. RNA extraction and Northern blot assays were performed as described previously (22Abid M.R. Tsai J.C. Spokes K.C. Deshpande S.S. Irani K. Aird W.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2548-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described (19Abid M.R. Guo S. Minami T. Spokes K.C. Ueki K. Skurk C. Walsh K. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The protein kinase assay was carried out using the HTScan Src kinase assay kit with a slight modification of the manufacturer's protocol (Cell Signaling). Briefly, HCAEC were lysed in buffer (60 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA) plus protease and protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. Reaction mixtures, containing 12.5 μl of cell lysates and 37.5 μl of kinase buffer (60 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 3 μm Na3VO4, 1.25 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP, 1.5 μm biotinylated peptide substrate), were incubated in a 96-well plate at room temperature for 30 min. 50 μl of STOP buffer (50 mm EDTA (pH 8)) were added per well to stop the reaction. 25-μl aliquots from each reaction were added to the well of a DELFIA streptavidin-coated, 96-well plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) containing 75 μl of distilled H2O, and the resulting mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Each well was then washed three times with PBS/T. 100 μl of primary mouse monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr-100; 1:1000 dilution) were added to each well. After 60 min of incubation at room temperature, each well was washed three times with PBS/T. 100 μl of secondary anti-mouse IgG (1:500 dilution in PBS/T with 1% BSA) were added to each well and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Wells were washed with PBS/T five times, and 100 μl of DELFIA enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were added for 5 min. Fluorescence emission was detected at a wavelength of 615 nm. Immunolocalization Studies—HCAEC were grown in 4-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Christchurch, New Zealand) and treated with or without VEGF for the times indicated. Subcellular localization of FKHR and ERK1/2 was determined using anti-FKHR and anti-ERK1/2 antibodies, respectively, and a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody as described previously (19Abid M.R. Guo S. Minami T. Spokes K.C. Ueki K. Skurk C. Walsh K. Aird W.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 294-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Quantitative analyses were carried out by counting 200 cells per time point. Complement-mediated Cell Lysis Assay—HCAEC were plated in 24-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h prior to siRNA transfection. 24 h following siRNA transfections, the cells were serum-starved overnight and then incubated with or without VEGF for 24 h. 7 μmol/liter calcein acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) were added to each well. 30 min later, cells were washed with serum starvation medium containing 1% BSA and then incubated for 30 min with 250 μl of monoclonal anti-endoglin (CD105) antibody (IgG2a) (Covance, Berkley, CA) to opsonize the cells. HCAEC were washed with HBSS containing 1% BSA and incubated with 250 μl of 5-20% baby rabbit complement (Serotec, Oxford, UK) at 37 °C for 30 min. The supernatant from each well was transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate. The remaining HCAEC in the 24-well plate were washed with HBSS plus 1% BSA, and the calcein remaining in the cells was released by incubation with 250 μl of HBSS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100. The lysate was then transferred to another 96-well plate, and the calcein released by complement and detergent was estimated using a fluorescence plate reader (model 680; BioRad). Percent specific lysis in triplicate wells was calculated as ((complement-mediated release - spontaneous release)/maximal release - spontaneous release)) × 100%, where maximal release = complement-mediated release + detergent-mediated release. Assay for Thrombomodulin-dependent Activation of Protein C—Functional assay for cellular thrombomodulin was carried out as described previously (51Kerlin B.A. Yan S.B. Isermann B.H. Brandt J.T.

https://openalex.org/W2015199039,"The most common cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) is defective folding of a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutant lacking Phe508 (ΔF508). The ΔF508 protein appears to be trapped in a prefolded state with incomplete packing of the transmembrane (TM) segments, a defect that can be repaired by expression in the presence of correctors such as corr-4a, VRT-325, and VRT-532. To determine whether the mechanism of correctors involves direct interactions with CFTR, our approach was to test whether correctors blocked disulfide cross-linking between cysteines introduced into the two halves of a Cys-less CFTR. Although replacement of the 18 endogenous cysteines of CFTR with Ser or Ala yields a Cys-less mutant that does not mature at 37 °C, we found that maturation could be restored if Val510 was changed to Ala, Cys, Ser, Thr, Gly, Ala, or Asp. The V510D mutation also promoted maturation of ΔF508 CFTR. The Cys-less/V510A mutant was used for subsequent cross-linking analysis as it yielded relatively high levels of mature protein that was functional in iodide efflux assays. We tested for cross-linking between cysteines introduced into TM6 and TM7 of Cys-less CFTR/V510A because cross-linking between TM6 and TM7 of P-glycoprotein, the sister protein of CFTR, was inhibited with the corrector VRT-325. Cys-less CFTR/V510A mutant containing cysteines at I340C(TM6) and S877C(TM7) could be cross-linked with a homobifunctional cross-linker. Correctors and the CFTR channel blocker benzbromarone, but not P-glycoprotein substrates, inhibited cross-linking of mutant I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7). These results suggest that corrector molecules such as corr-4a interact directly with CFTR. The most common cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) is defective folding of a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutant lacking Phe508 (ΔF508). The ΔF508 protein appears to be trapped in a prefolded state with incomplete packing of the transmembrane (TM) segments, a defect that can be repaired by expression in the presence of correctors such as corr-4a, VRT-325, and VRT-532.

Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou J.L. Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C. Science. 1989; 245: 1066-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (5811) Google Scholar). The most common genetic lesion is deletion of Phe508 (ΔF508). The ΔF508 CFTR protein undergoes rapid degradation because it is defective in folding. The Phe508 position is also important for folding of other ATP-binding cassette transporters, such as the sister protein of CFTR, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Deletion of the equivalent residue in human P-gp (ΔY490) also causes defective folding of P-gp and rapid degradation (2Hoof T. Demmer A. Hadam M.R. Riordan J.R. Tummler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20575-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on P-gp showed that a drug-rescue approach with drug substrates could be used to correct folding defects in processing mutants such as ΔY490 P-gp (3Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Therefore, several groups have used high throughput screening to search for small molecule correctors that would promote maturation of CFTR-processing mutants (4Pedemonte N. Lukacs G.L. Du K. Caci E.

The quinazoline derivative VRT-325 was first identified that can promote maturation of both P-gp- and CFTR-processing mutants (3Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 5Van Goor F. Straley K.S. Cao D. Gonzalez J. Hadida S. Hazlewood A. Joubran J. Knapp T. Makings L.R.

Some correctors, such as corr-4a, corr-2b, and VRT-532, however, appeared to specifically promote maturation of ΔF508 CFTR (6Wang Y. Bartlett M.C. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Further study showed that correctors could have an additive effect on maturation of CFTR-processing mutants (7Wang Y. Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is not known, however, whether correctors directly bind to CFTR or have indirect effects on the cellular folding pathways. In this study, we tested whether correctors directly interacted with CFTR by assaying for inhibition of disulfide cross-linking between the two halves of the protein. Construction of Mutants—Mutations were introduced into CFTR cDNAs by the method of Kunkel (8Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). Cys-less CFTR was constructed by replacing Cys590 and Cys592 with leucine (9Mense M. White D.M. Vergani P. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 55Google Scholar) and the other 16 endogenous cysteines at positions 76, 126, 225, 276, 343, 491, 524, 657, 832, 866, 1344, 1355, 1395, 1400, 1410, and 1458 with alanine. A total of 16 double cysteine mutants were constructed using the Cys-less CFTR molecule by introducing one cysteine into the Thr338–Ser341 segment of TM6 and one cysteine into the Ala875–Leu878 segment of TM7. The Cys-less CFTR cDNA was also modified to include the V510X mutations. Mutations I340C(TM6) and S877C(TM7) were inserted into Cys-less CFTR/V510A singly or together. The V510X mutations were then introduced into ΔF508 CFTR as described above. The ΔF508 mutation was also introduced into the Cys-less/V510A and I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7)/Cys-less/V510A mutants. The cDNAs were sequenced to confirm the presence of mutations (10Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Expression of Mutants and Measurement of Iodide Efflux—CFTR mutant cDNAs were transiently transfected in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells as described previously (11Chen E.Y. Bartlett M.C. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39620-39627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Whole cell SDS extracts were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (5.5% acrylamide gels) after expression for 48 h at 37 °C followed by immunoblot analysis with rabbit polyclonal antibody against CFTR (11Chen E.Y. Bartlett M.C. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39620-39627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Measurement of cAMP-stimulated iodide efflux was performed on baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells stably expressing CFTR protein as described previously (6Wang Y. Bartlett M.C. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (11Chen E.Y. Bartlett M.C. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39620-39627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The forskolin mix that was added at time 0 to stimulate CFTR contained 10 μm forskolin, 200 nm isobutylmethylxanthine, 50 nm CPT-cAMP, and 10 μm VRT-532. Disulfide Cross-linking Analysis—CFTR mutant I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7) Cys-less/V510A CFTR was expressed in HEK 293 cells. The cells were harvested, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in Tris-buffered saline (pH 8.0). To study the effect of drugs on cross-linking, cell samples were preincubated for 30 min at 22 °C in the absence or presence of various compounds. The final concentrations were 0.003, 0.03, or 0.33 mm corr-4a, VRT-325, VRT-532, or verapamil and 0.007, 0.07, or 0.7 mm benzbromarone or demecolcine. Samples were then incubated with 0.1 mm cross-linker (1,5-pentanediyl-bismethanethiosulfonate (M5M) (9.1 Å), 3,6-dioxaoctane-1,8-diyl-bismethanethiosulfonate (M8M) (13 Å), 3,6,9-trioxaundecane-1,11-diyl-bismethanethiosulfonate (M11M) (16.9. Å), 3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecane-1,14-diyl bismethanethiosulfonate (M14M) (20.8 Å), or 3,6,9,12,15-pentaoxaheptadecane-1,17-diyl bismethanethiosulfonate (M17M) (24.7 Å) (Toronto Research Chemicals) for 16 min at 22 °C in the presence of 0.01% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside to enhance the solubility of the cross-linkers. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm EDTA and no reducing agent, and samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gels) and immunoblot analysis as described previously (12Wang Y. Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All transfections and assays were repeated at least in triplicate. We had previously shown that the corrector VRT-325 directly interacts with P-gp because it inhibited cross-linking between cysteines located in TM6 and TM7 (12Wang Y. Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our goal was to test whether correctors that promoted maturation of ΔF508 CFTR such as corr-4a, VRT-325, and VRT-532 directly interacted with the protein. Since P-gp and CFTR are both ATP-binding cassette transporters, it was possible that the correctors would also inhibit cross-linking between TM6 and TM7 of CFTR. To use a cross-linking approach with CFTR, the first step would be to construct a Cys-less CFTR that matures and is functional at the cell surface. A Cys-less CFTR in which all 18 endogenous cysteines were changed to serines did not mature at 27 or 37 °C, so it was unsuitable for cross-linking analysis (11Chen E.Y. Bartlett M.C. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39620-39627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We then constructed another Cys-less CFTR in which Cys590 and Cys592 were changed to leucine and the remaining 16 cysteines were changed to alanine. These changes have been reported to yield mature protein when expression is carried out at 27 °C (13Mense M. Vergani P. White D.M. Altberg G. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4728-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 14Cui L. Aleksandrov L.A. Hou Y.X. Gentzsch M. Chen J.H. Riordan J.R. Aleksandrov A.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 572: 347-358Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The yield of mature Cys-less CFTR is often limiting even after expression at 27 °C. Therefore, it was important to use a Cys-less CFTR that yielded relatively high amounts of mature protein when expressed at 37 °C. Thibodeau et al. (15Thibodeau P.H. Brautigam C.A. Machius M. Thomas P.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) had shown that mutating residue Phe508 to most other amino acids (except cysteine) inhibited maturation of CFTR. Therefore, we predicted that introduction of a cysteine close to Phe508 may also promote maturation of Cys-less CFTR at 37 °C. Accordingly, we replaced the residues at positions 508, 509, 510, 511, or 512 of Cys-less CFTR with cysteine. Whole cell SDS extracts of HEK 293 cells transfected with the mutant cDNAs were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The mature and immature forms of CFTR can be distinguished on SDS-PAGE gels because CFTR contains two N-glycosylation sites (Fig. 1A) that are core-glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum but are modified with complex carbohydrates in the Golgi. Fig. 2A shows that only the V510C mutation promoted maturation of Cys-less CFTR at 37 °C.FIGURE 2Effect of Val510 mutations on maturation of CFTR-processing mutants. A, HEK 293 cells expressing wild-type (WT), Cys-less CFTR (–), or Cys-less CFTR (+) with residues 508–512 replaced with cysteine were subjected to immunoblot analysis with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against CFTR. B, whole cell SDS extracts of HEK 293 cells expressing wild-type, Cys-less CFTR (–), or Cys-less CFTR (+) in which residue Val510 was changed to the indicated amino acid were subjected to immunoblot analysis. C, iodide efflux assays were performed on stable BHK cell lines expressing Cys-less/V510A CFTR (open circles) or Cys-less/V510D CFTR (closed squares). Time 0 is the start of the stimulation by the addition of the forskolin mix (+ forskolin). D, whole cell SDS extracts of HEK 293 cells expressing wild-type, ΔF508 CFTR (–), or ΔF508 CFTR (+) with the indicated changes at residue Val510 were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The positions of the mature and immature CFTRs are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then tested whether replacing Val510 of Cys-less CFTR with other amino acids would promote maturation. Cys-less mutants in which residue Val510 was changed to Pro, Thr, Tyr, Gly, Ala, Ser, Leu, Asp, Phe, or Trp were constructed. The mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells at 37 °C, and whole cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 2B shows that changing Val510 to Thr, Gly, Ala, Ser, or Asp promoted maturation of Cys-less CFTR. We then tested whether the changes to residue Val510 that promoted maturation of Cys-less CFTR yielded a functional protein. Stable BHK cell lines expressing mutants V510A, V510C, V510S, V510G, or V510D were generated for use in iodide efflux assays. It was found that all the mutants except V501D were active in the iodide efflux assays. The results of the most active (V510A) and least active (V510D) mutants are shown in Fig. 2C. The results of mutants V510C, V510S, or V510G are not shown for clarity. To test whether the Val510 changes could also promote maturation of ΔF508 CFTR (in a wild-type background), we introduced the Val510 mutations that promoted maturation of Cys-less CFTR (Val510 to Cys, Gly, Ala, Ser, Asp, or Thr) into ΔF508 CFTR. The ΔF508 CFTR/V510X mutants were expressed in HEK 293 cells at 37 °C, and whole cell extracts were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 2D shows that introduction of an Asp mutation at position 510 was most effective in promoting maturation of ΔF508 CFTR. The Cys-less/V510A CFTR mutant was then used for disulfide cross-linking analysis to test whether correctors directly interacted with the protein. Since corrector VRT-325 inhibited cross-linking of P-gp mutant L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7), we aligned TM segments (6 and 7) of P-gp and CFTR to identify the equivalent residues in CFTR. The segments Thr338 to Ser341 (TM6) and Ala875 to Leu878 (TM7) in CFTR (Fig. 1B) were predicted to overlap residues L339C(TM6) and F728C(TM7) of P-gp. Accordingly, 16 double cysteine mutants were constructed to contain one cysteine in segment 338–341 (TM6) and another in segment 875–878 (TM7). The 16 double cysteine mutants were initially constructed in a Cys-less CFTR lacking V510A, so they required expression at 27 °C for maturation of CFTR (data not shown). The cells were then subjected to cross-linking analysis with M11M cross-linker. Relatively strong cross-linking was observed in mutant I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7), whereas the other mutants showed little or no cross-linking (data not shown). The I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7) mutations were then introduced into the Cys-less/V510A CFTR background. The I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7) Cys-less/V510A CFTR mutant was expressed in HEK 293 cells, and samples were treated with methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers of various sizes and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Cross-linking between the TMDs causes CFTR to migrate slower on SDS-PAGE gels (11Chen E.Y. Bartlett M.C. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39620-39627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that mutant I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7) Cys-less/V510A CFTR could be cross-linked with various methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers. The magnitude of the change in the mobility of cross-linked CFTR was similar to that observed when cysteines introduced into TM6 and TM12 were cross-linked (11Chen E.Y. Bartlett M.C. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39620-39627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The smallest (M5M) and largest (M17M) cross-linkers were less efficient in promoting cross-linking when compared with M11M (Fig. 3A). Therefore, M11M was used in subsequent cross-linking assays. Cross-linking was not detected in mutants containing either I340C(TM6) or S877C(TM7) alone (Fig. 3B). A method to test whether a compound can occupy the drug-binding pocket is to determine whether it will inhibit cross-linking between cysteines located in the predicted binding region (12Wang Y. Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7) Cys-less/V510A CFTR mutant was used as a reporter molecule to study CFTR interactions with CFTR correctors such as corr-4a (4Pedemonte N. Lukacs G.L. Du K. Caci E.

Bartlett M.C. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We first tested the system by using a compound that binds within the CFTR channel pore (at the interface between the two TMDs) and to see whether it could block cross-linking of mutant I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7) Cys-less/V510A CFTR. Benzbromarone is a CFTR inhibitor that blocks channel activity by occupying the pore (18Diena T. Melani R. Caci E. Pedemonte N. Sondo E. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2007; 560: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Accordingly, HEK 293 cells expressing mutant I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7) Cys-less/V510A CFTR were preincubated with various concentrations of benzbromarone and then treated with M11M cross-linker. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer containing no reducing agent and samples subjected to immunoblot analysis. Fig. 4A shows that benzbromarone at a concentration of 0.7 mm blocked cross-linking. Similarly, the correctors corr-4a (Fig. 4B), VRT-325 (Fig. 4C), or VRT-532 (Fig. 4D) nearly abolished cross-linking at concentrations of 0.33 mm. To test whether inhibition of cross-linking was specific, we tested the hydrophobic compounds verapamil and demecolcine that are substrates of P-gp (19Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39706-39710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Verapamil (Fig. 4E) and demecolcine (Fig. 4F) did not inhibit cross-linking of mutant I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7) Cys-less/V510A CFTR. These results suggest that benzbromarone, corr-4a, VRT-325, and VRT-532 inhibited cross-linking through direct interactions with CFTR. We could not test whether correctors blocked cross-linking in the ΔF508/I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7)/Cys-less/V510A mutant because mature CFTR was not detected in mutants ΔF508/Cys-less/V510A or ΔF508/I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7)/Cys-less/V510A even when expressed at 27 °C (Fig. 4, G and H). Mutation of residue Val510 to other amino acids such as Cys, Ser, Ala, Gly, Thr, and Asp could suppress folding defects of Cys-less CFTR (Fig. 2B). Position 510 appears to be particularly important for CFTR maturation as introduction of the suppressor mutation V510D into ΔF508 CFTR also promoted maturation of the protein (Fig. 2D). NBD1 of CFTR appears to be particularly important for CFTR maturation as studies by Teem et al. (20Teem J.L. Berger H.A. Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. Tsui L.C. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 335-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 21DeCarvalho A.C. Gansheroff L.J. Teem J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35896-35905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) showed that mutations within or close to the LSGGQ signature sequence promoted maturation of CFTR-processing mutants. The segment of amino acids encompassing Phe508 to Val510 appears to be a critical component for CFTR folding because mutations to Phe508 inhibit maturation (15Thibodeau P.H. Brautigam C.A. Machius M. Thomas P.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), whereas some mutations to Val510 promote maturation (this study). Residues Phe508 and Val510 may be important for NBD1-TMD1 interactions during folding of CFTR (22Lewis H.A. Zhao X. Wang C. Sauder J.M. Rooney I. Noland B.W. Lorimer D. Kearins M.C. Conners K.

The V510D mutation may counter the effects of ΔF508 by acting as a suppressor mutation, perhaps by forming a salt bridge with a positive amino acid located in one of the intracellular loops. The first intracellular loop contains 6 positively charged amino acids. The region surrounding Val510 might also be involved in a regulation pathway for CFTR trafficking as a protein kinase CK2 site (Ser511) has been identified in this segment (23Treharne K.J. Crawford R.M. Xu Z. Chen J.H. Best O.G. Schulte E.A. Gruenert D.C. Wilson S.M. Sheppard D.N. Kunzelmann K. Mehta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10804-10813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although V510D was the most efficient suppressor mutation because it promoted maturation of both Cys-less and ΔF508 CFTRs, it was less useful than the V510A change in Cys-less CFTR because it showed reduced iodide efflux activity. Some changes to amino acids close to Phe508 could be detrimental to function because it has been shown that the Phe508 aromatic side chain is important for ion channel function (14Cui L.

The ability of VRT-325, VRT-532, and corr-4a (Fig. 4) to block cross-linking of I340C(TM6)/S877C(TM7) Cys-less/V510A CFTR suggests that they interact directly with CFTR. Compounds VRT-532 and corr-4a may be particularly interesting because they show specificity for rescue of CFTR as they did not promote maturation of P-gp-processing mutants (6Wang Y. Bartlett M.C. Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, rescue of ΔF508 CFTR with corr-4a was found to be superior to less specific approaches that utilize curcumin, miglustat, and thapsigargin (12Wang Y. Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The proposed effects of the V510D mutation and correctors on maturation of ΔF508 CFTR are shown in the models in supplemental Fig. 1. The ΔF508 CFTR is predicted to be trapped in a “loosely folded” immature conformation since the presence of the mutation interferes with formation of the NBD1-TMD1 contacts, which in turn would disrupt proper packing of the TM segments (supplemental Fig. 1A). The V510D suppressor mutation is predicted to overcome the effects of the ΔF508 CFTR mutation by promoting interactions between TMD1 and NBD1 (supplemental Fig. 1B). When ΔF508 CFTR is expressed in the presence of the corrector corr-4a, it likely interacts with and promotes packing of the TM segments to yield mature CFTR (supplemental Fig. 1C). Packing of the TM segments in CFTR appears to be a critical step in folding as interactions between the TMDs are monitored by proteins such as derlin-1 and RMA-1 (24Zhang H. Schmidt B.Z. Sun F. Condliffe S.B. Butterworth M.B. Youker R.T. Brodsky J.L. Aridor M. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol.

Braakman I. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that correctors such as corr-4a bind outside the TMDs and promote maturation (and inhibit cross-linking) through long range conformational effects. It should be pointed out that although we have demonstrated that correctors corr-4a, VRT-325, and VRT-532 can directly interact with CFTR, it is still possible that they could promote maturation of CFTR by interactions with other targets.

https://openalex.org/W1964890294,"The phenotypic plasticity of mature vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) facilitates angiogenesis and wound healing, but VSCM dedifferentiation also contributes to vascular pathologies such as intimal hyperplasia. Insulin/insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is unique among growth factors in promoting VSMC differentiation via preferential activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt. We have previously reported that rapamycin promotes VSMC differentiation by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) target S6K1. Here, we show that rapamycin activates Akt and induces contractile protein expression in human VSMC in an insulin-like growth factor I-dependent manner, by relieving S6K1-dependent negative regulation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). In skeletal muscle and adipocytes, rapamycin relieves mTOR/S6K1-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of IRS-1, thus preventing IRS-1 degradation and enhancing PI3K activation. We report that this mechanism is functional in VSMCs and crucial for rapamycin-induced differentiation. Rapamycin inhibits S6K1-dependent IRS-1 serine phosphorylation, increases IRS-1 protein levels, and promotes association of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 with PI3K. A rapamycin-resistant S6K1 mutant prevents rapamycin-induced Akt activation and VSMC differentiation. Notably, we find that rapamycin selectively activates only the Akt2 isoform and that Akt2, but not Akt1, is sufficient to induce contractile protein expression. Akt2 is required for rapamycin-induced VSMC differentiation, whereas Akt1 appears to oppose contractile protein expression. The anti-restenotic effect of rapamycin in patients may be attributable to this unique pattern of PI3K effector regulation wherein anti-differentiation signals from S6K1 are inhibited, but pro-differentiation Akt2 activity is promoted through an IRS-1 feedback signaling mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2014341627,"Extracellular accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) has been linked to the development of Alzheimer disease. The importance of intraneuronal Aβ has been recognized more recently. Although considerable evidence indicates that extracellular Aβ contributes to the intracellular pool of Aβ, the mechanisms involved in Aβ uptake by neurons are poorly understood. We examined the molecular mechanisms involved in Aβ-(1–42) internalization by primary neurons in the absence of apolipoprotein E. We demonstrated that Aβ-(1–42) is more efficiently internalized by axons than by cell bodies of sympathetic neurons, suggesting that Aβ-(1–42) uptake might be mediated by proteins enriched in the axons. Although the acetylcholine receptor α7nAChR, previously suggested to be involved in Aβ internalization, is enriched in axons, our results indicate that it does not mediate Aβ-(1–42) internalization. Moreover, receptors of the low density lipoprotein receptor family are not essential for Aβ-(1–42) uptake in the absence of apolipoprotein E because receptor-associated protein had no effect on Aβ uptake. By expressing the inactive dynamin mutant dynK44A and the clathrin hub we found that Aβ-(1–42) internalization is independent of clathrin but dependent on dynamin, which suggests an endocytic pathway involving caveolae/lipid rafts. Confocal microscopy studies showing that Aβ did not co-localize with the early endosome marker EEA1 further support a clathrin-independent mechanism. The lack of co-localization of Aβ with caveolin in intracellular vesicles and the normal uptake of Aβ by neurons that do not express caveolin indicate that Aβ does not require caveolin either. Instead partial co-localization of Aβ-(1–42) with cholera toxin subunit B and sensitivity to reduction of cellular cholesterol and sphingolipid levels suggest a caveolae-independent, raft-mediated mechanism. Understanding the molecular events involved in neuronal Aβ internalization might identify potential therapeutic targets for Alzheimer disease.

Nature. 1999; 399: A23-A31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). The amyloid cascade hypothesis predicts that a gradual increase of Aβ-(1–42) levels in brain interstitial fluid (3Skovronsky D.M. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. J.

Med. 2004; 140: 627-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Current evidence indicates that intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ is an early pathological biomarker for the onset of AD and may contribute to the cascade of neurodegenerative events (6D'Andrea M.R. Nagele R.G. Wang H.Y. Peterson P.A. Lee D.H. Histopathology. 2001; 38: 120-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, microinjection of Aβ-(1–42) or cDNA encoding Aβ-(1–42) in cultured human neurons resulted in neurotoxicity (9Zhang Y. McLaughlin R. Goodyer C. LeBlanc A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Besides, in the triple transgenic mouse model for AD there is a correlation between long term potentiation abnormalities and intraneuronal Aβ accumulation, all of which take place before the appearance of plaques or tangles (10Oddo S. Caccamo A. Shepherd J.D. Murphy M.P. Golde T.E. Kayed R. Metherate R. Mattson M.P. Akbari Y. LaFerla F.M. Neuron. 2003; 39: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3158) Google Scholar). Intracellular accumulation of Aβ-(1–42) results from one or a combination of the following processes: decreased Aβ degradation (disruption of the ubiquitin-proteasome system), increased intracellular generation of Aβ, and increased uptake of Aβ from an external source (11D'Andrea M.R. Nagele R.G. Wang H.Y. Lee D.H. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 333: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both increased intracellular Aβ generation and uptake of extracellular Aβ are consistent with the endosomal/lysosomal localization of intracellular Aβ (12Takahashi R.H. Milner T.A. Li F. Nam E.E.

Jin L.W. Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Deposits of oligomeric Aβ are preferentially found on distal axons and synapses in mouse brains suggesting that these structures might represent the cellular entry points for Aβ (14Kokubo H. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Saido T.C. Iwata N. Helms J.B. Yamaguchi H. Brain Res. 2005; 1045: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In support of the role of axons in Aβ-induced neurotoxicity we have demonstrated previously that neurons exposed to Aβ exclusively in distal axons are more susceptible to apoptosis than neurons exposed only in cell bodies suggesting the possible involvement of axons in Aβ uptake (15Song M.S. Saavedra L. de Chaves E.I. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 1224-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nevertheless to our knowledge direct demonstration of Aβ uptake by axons is still missing. In the brain, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid as well as in senile plaques Aβ is associated to apolipoprotein E (apoE) (16Namba Y. Tomonaga M. Kawasaki H. Otomo E. Ikeda K. Brain Res. 1991; 541: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 17Permanne B. Perez C. Soto C. Frangione B. Wisniewski T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Commun. 1993; 192: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Besides a pool of free Aβ likely exists. Internalization of the complex Aβ-apoE has been extensively studied (19Yang D.S. Small D.H. Seydel U. Smith J.D. Hallmayer J. Gandy S.E. Martins R.N. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 1217-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Gylys K.H. Fein J.A. Tan A.M. Cole G.M. J.

Sci. 2002; 32: 65-74PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanism that mediates uptake of Aβ that is not complexed to apoE is largely unknown. This pool likely increases considerably during AD development. Therefore, targeting free Aβ internalization might represent a way to regulate intracellular Aβ levels. In the present study, we examined the molecular mechanisms of Aβ-(1–42) internalization by primary neurons in the absence of lipoproteins. Reagents and Antibodies—Leibovitz L15-CO2 culture medium was from Invitrogen. Mouse NGF (2.5 S) was purchased from Alomone Laboratories Ltd. (Jerusalem, Israel). NGF antibody (sheep anti-NGF) was purchased from Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd. (Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Fumonisin B1 was obtained from Biomol International. Mouse monoclonal anti-human Aβ (clone 4G8) was from Signet. Antibodies against α7nAChR and EEA1 were kindly provided by Dr. Jhamandas (University of Alberta) and Dr. Wang (University of Alberta), respectively.

Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride was from Bio-Rad. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. Aβ-(1–42) was purchased from American Peptide Co. (Sunnyvale, CA). The same lot number was used throughout the studies unless specified. Fluorescein-labeled Aβ-(1–42) (fluo-Aβ-(1–42)) was purchased from AnaSpec (San Jose, CA).

Filipin complex was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were from Fisher. Culture of Neurons—Sympathetic neurons were isolated from superior cervical ganglia of newborn Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured in compartmentalized dishes as before (22Song M.S. Posse de Chaves E.I. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 1130-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Dissociated neurons (0.3 ganglia/dish) were plated in the center compartment. Within 1–2 days, axons elongated along the tracks and entered the side compartments that contained medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml NGF. Medium supplied to the center compartment contained 2.5% rat serum, 1 mg/ml ascorbic acid, 10–15 μm cytosine arabinoside, and 10 ng/ml NGF. After 5–6 days cytosine arabinoside treatment was discontinued, and NGF was confined to the side compartments. For some experiments sympathetic neurons were cultured in 8-well chamber slides or 24-well dishes. Sympathetic neurons from caveolin-1 knock-out (Cav1–/–) and control ((B6 129 SF2/J) (Cav1+/+)) mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were isolated and cultured as above. Experiments started at day 7–8 in culture. Rat basal forebrain cholinergic neurons were generously provided by Dr. Jhamandas (University of Alberta) and were prepared as before (23Jhamandas J.H. MacTavish D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5579-5584Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Experiments started at day 3 in culture. Before the treatments neurons were rinsed several times with medium without serum, and the experimental treatments were performed in the absence of serum. Aβ-(1–42) Preparations—Non-fluorescent and fluorescein-conjugated Aβ-(1–42) peptide were prepared according to published protocols (24Dahlgren K.N. Manelli A.M. Stine Jr., W.B. Baker L.K. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32046-32053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). Briefly Aβ-(1–42) peptide was initially dissolved to 1 mm in hexafluoroisopropanol and separated into aliquots in sterile microcentrifuge tubes. Hexafluoroisopropanol was dried under a stream of N2, and the peptide film was desiccated at –20 °C. The peptide was resuspended in Me2SO at a concentration of 5 mm. L15-CO2 medium (phenol red-free, antibiotic-free, and serum-free) was added to bring the peptide to a final concentration of 100 μm and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. To prepare biotinylated Aβ (bio-Aβ-(1–42)), a solution of 100 μm Aβ-(1–42) was treated with a 1.5 mg/ml concentration of the membrane-impermeable derivative of biotin (sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin) in Leibovitz L15-CO2 medium (phenol red-free, antibiotics free, serum free) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 250 mm glycine. The biotinylated peptide was diluted in Leibovitz L15-CO2 medium to the appropriate concentration. All Aβ preparations used were similar to those characterized previously (24Dahlgren K.N. Manelli A.M. Stine Jr., W.B. Baker L.K. Krafft G.A. LaDu M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32046-32053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar) in that they contain monomers and oligomers of Aβ but do not contain fibrils (see supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). Fluo-Aβ-(1–42) and bio-Aβ-(1–42) induced neuronal apoptosis like the non-modified peptide (supplemental Fig. 1). Immunoblotting—For the detection of Aβ, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS using two buffers system (25Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). For all other experiments the concentration of polyacrylamide gels was 10% containing 0.1% SDS. Transfer of proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes was performed overnight at 4 °C in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 16% methanol buffer, pH 8.3. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) containing 5% nonfat milk (blocking buffer) and incubated overnight in the primary antibody solution prepared in TTBS containing 5% nonfat milk. Primary antibodies for Aβ (4G8) (1:1000) and anti-α7nAChR (1:1000) were used. Membranes were washed two times with Tris-buffered saline, two times with TTBS, and two times with Tris-buffered saline and then incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody (1:2000) in blocking buffer at room temperature with gentle agitation. Immunoreactivity was detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Receptor Binding Assays—Radioligand binding assay in cultured neuronal membranes was performed as described earlier (26Samuel N. Wonnacott S. Lindstrom J. Futerman A.H. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 222: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In brief, cultured neurons were scraped into ice-cold Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.4) and then homogenized by passing the cell lysates several times through a Pasteur pipette. Membranes were centrifuged three times and then incubated for 2 h at 22 °C in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 nm 125I-α-BTx (2000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) as mentioned before (27Vaucher E. Fluit P. Chishti M.A. Westaway D. Mount H.T. Kar S. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 175: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled α-BTx. Displacement of 125I-α-BTx binding sites was also simultaneously studied in the presence or absence of 100 μm nicotine and 5 μm Aβ-(1–42). Incubations were terminated by rapid filtration using a cell harvester filtering apparatus, and then radioactivity was measured using a γ counter. Binding experiments were performed four times, each in triplicate, and data are represented as percentage of specific binding. Adenoviral Infection—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing the tetracycline-regulated chimeric transcription activator (tTA), hemagglutinin-tagged wild type dynamin, hemagglutinin-tagged dynK44A mutant, and T7-tagged clathrin hub were prepared by Dr. Altschuler (28Altschuler Y. Barbas S.M. Terlecky L.J. Tang K. Hardy S. Mostov K.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and obtained from Dr. Nabi (University of British Columbia). To enhance the infection, viral stocks were preincubated with polylysine (29Le P.U. Nabi I.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1059-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Infection of sympathetic neurons with serial dilutions of adenovirus constructs was used to determine the minimum amount of virus necessary to infect the majority of the neuronal population (>80%). Titration was performed using QuickTiter Adenovirus Titer Immunoassay kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc.-Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd., Ontario, Canada). Neurons cultured in compartmentalized dishes were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 100 in 50 μl of L15-CO2 medium containing 50 ng/ml NGF, 2.5% rat serum, and 1 mg/ml ascorbic acid added to the cell body-containing compartment for 24 h. The next day the medium was replaced with fresh medium. The experiments were initiated after 48–72 h of viral protein expression. To examine the expression of the recombinant proteins, cellular material from control and infected cultures was collected directly in modified Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblot. Assessment of Aβ Internalization by Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Fluo-Aβ-(1–42) was provided to sympathetic neurons cultured in three-compartment cultures or 8-well slides. The internalization of fluo-Aβ-(1–42) in living neurons was examined using a Nikon TE300 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon digital camera, DXM-1200 (Nikon, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Images were taken and analyzed using Northern Eclipse Version 7.0 image capture and analysis software (Empix Imaging, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). For confocal microscopy studies, after the indicated treatments in each experiment, culture medium was removed, and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, and then blocked using 0.1% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline (blocking buffer) for 1 h. For detection of caveolin, primary rabbit anti-caveolin (1:250) and secondary Alexa594-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody prepared in blocking buffer (1:1000) were used. Pictures were taken using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with an S-Fluor 40×/1.3 oil objective using appropriate filter sets and excitation wavelengths. Co-localization was quantified using Metamorph software. For both channels, the best fit lower threshold value to remove most background signal was determined using the threshold tool. Assessment of Aβ Internalization Using Biotinylated Aβ—Biotinylated Aβ was added to neurons, and internalization was allowed to occur by incubation at 37 °C. At the end of the experiment, the biotin moiety from Aβ that remained outside the neurons was cleaved by reducing its disulfide linkage with glutathione buffer (two times for 15 min at 4 °C). Excess glutathione was inactivated using 5 mg/ml iodoacetamide in phosphate-buffered saline (two times for 5 min at 4 °C) (30Kuruvilla R. Zweifel L.S. Glebova N.O. Lonze B.E. Valdez G. Ye H. Ginty D.D. Cell. 2004; 118: 243-255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Finally neurons were lysed using RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 2 mm MgCl2) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete Mini, Roche Diagnostics). The internalized bio-Aβ-(1–42) protected from the cleavage buffer was pulled down with ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin beads. The samples were eluted from the beads with boiling Laemmli sample buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue), resolved by SDS-PAGE (25Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar), and immunoblotted with 4G8 antibody against Aβ as above. Assessment of Aβ Internalization by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Aβ-(1–42) was provided to sympathetic neurons cultured in three-compartment cultures. Cellular material from the cell body-containing compartment of three dishes of the same treatment was harvested in 0.05 n NaOH. The mass of Aβ-(1–42) in cell bodies was quantified using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's specifications. Incubation with chromogen substrate produced a colorimetric response (450 nm) measured using a SpectroMax (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) microtiter plate reader. Protein content was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). The data are presented as pg of Aβ/μg of protein. Detection of Nuclear Apoptosis—Apoptotic cell death was identified by nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258 as described previously (15Song M.S. Saavedra L. de Chaves E.I. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 1224-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nuclei were visualized using a Nikon TE300 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Nikon digital camera, DXM-1200. Images were analyzed using Northern Eclipse Version 7.0 image capture and analysis software (Empix Imaging). Five hundred to 1000 neurons per treatment were counted by an observer “blinded” to the neuronal treatment. Aβ-(1–42) Is Preferentially Internalized by Axons, Is Retrogradely Transported, and Accumulates in Cell Bodies—We examined the ability of neurons to internalize Aβ in the absence of ligands (apoE and α2-microglobulin) that bind to known surface receptors. Basal forebrain and sympathetic neurons, two neuronal types that respond similarly to Aβ-(1–42) (15Song M.S. Saavedra L. de Chaves E.I. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 1224-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), were able to internalize fluo-Aβ-(1–42) (Fig. 1A). Due to its hydrophobic nature, a significant portion of Aβ remained attached to the cell surface, and therefore it was difficult to differentiate plasma membrane-bound Aβ from internalized Aβ. Therefore, we used a biotin internalization assay to confirm Aβ uptake. In this assay the biotin moiety of Aβ that remains bound to the extracellular aspect of the plasma membrane is cleaved. Hence when streptavidin is used to separate bio-Aβ-(1–42) only internalized Aβ, which is protected from cleavage, is recovered. In this way, we confirmed that Aβ-(1–42) is internalized by neurons in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). To make sure that apoE was absent in our studies, in addition to performing the experiments in the absence of serum we confirmed that neurons were not making apoE even when treated with Aβ (supplemental Fig. 2). Previous studies in mouse brain using specific immunodetection indicated that Aβ localizes to cell processes, especially to axon terminals, suggesting the involvement of axons in Aβ uptake (31Kokubo H. Kayed R. Glabe C.G. Yamaguchi H. Brain Res. 2005; 1031: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 32Muresan Z. Muresan V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4982-4997Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To investigate Aβ internalization by cell bodies and axons separately, we chose a compartmentalized culture system (33Campenot R.B. Dev. Biol. 1982; 93: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which allows the selective treatment of distal axons or cell bodies with Aβ (15Song M.S. Saavedra L. de Chaves E.I. Neurobiol. Aging. 2006; 27: 1224-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When fluo-Aβ-(1–42) was added to the distal axon-containing compartment (DAX) only, we observed significant Aβ internalization and retrograde transport to the cell body/proximal axon-containing compartment (CB) (Fig. 1C, a–d). Moreover, we detected a dramatic increase of the mass of Aβ in the cell bodies, confirming Aβ uptake and transport (Fig. 1D). In contrast, when fluo-Aβ-(1–42) was added exclusively to CB, there was significantly less Aβ internalization, and Aβ anterograde transport was almost negligible (Fig. 1C, e–h). Unfortunately we could not quantify the mass of Aβ when it was provided to cell bodies because the small amount of Aβ associated to the surface of cell bodies was sufficient to interfere with the determination. To confirm the preferential Aβ uptake by axons, we treated sympathetic neurons in DAX or CB with bio-Aβ-(1–42) and examined Aβ internalization after cleavage of extracellular Aβ as indicated above. We were able to detect bio-Aβ-(1–42) only in neurons given Aβ in the distal axons (Fig. 1E). The fact that Aβ internalization occurs preferentially through axons suggests that the mechanism that mediates Aβ uptake is regulated and likely involves proteins that are enriched in the axons. α-Bungarotoxin and Receptor-associated Protein Do Not Affect Aβ Internalization—A receptor previously implicated in Aβ internalization is the α7nAChR (34Nagele R.G. D'Andrea M.R. Anderson W.J. Wang H.Y. Neuroscience. 2002; 110: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Hence we investigated whether α7nAChR was enriched in distal axons of neurons cultured in three-compartment dishes. In parallel, we examined the expression of α7nAChR in basal forebrain neurons and sympathetic neurons cultured in regular dishes. As expected, α7nAChR was highly expressed in basal forebrain neurons and in sympathetic neurons cultured under cholinergic (with leukemia inhibitory factor) as well as adrenergic (without leukemia inhibitory factor) conditions (Fig. 2A). Importantly we found a dramatic enrichment of this receptor in distal axons compared with cell bodies/proximal axons, making α7nAChR a good candidate to mediate Aβ uptake. However, competition binding experiments showed that 5 μm Aβ-(1–42) was unable to significantly compete with 125I-α-BTx receptor binding sites in membranes prepared from sympathetic neurons (Fig. 2B). In contrast, 1 μm unlabeled α-BTx (i.e. nonspecific binding) and 10 μm nicotine potently displaced 125I-α-BTx binding, thus indicating that the sites recognized by this ligand represent a subset of nicotinic receptors. These data, in agreement with a recent report (35Small D.H. Maksel D. Kerr M.L. Ng J. Hou X. Chu C. Mehrani H. Unabia S. Azari M.F. Loiacono R. Aguilar M.I. Chebib M. J. Neurochem. 2007; 101: 1527-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggest that Aβ does not compete with the α7nAhR binding site. Accordingly in neurons given α-BTx together with fluo-Aβ-(1–42) there was no decrease in Aβ internalization (Fig. 2C). All together our data suggest that α7nAChR does not mediate Aβ uptake at least in neurons under our experimental conditions. A second group of receptors that distribute differently to cell bodies and axons (36Posse De Chaves E.I. Vance D.E. Campenot R.B. Kiss R.S. Vance J.E. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2008651258,"Background The detection of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a major component of tuberculosis (TB) control strategies. In addition to the tuberculosis skin test (TST), novel blood tests, based on in vitro release of IFN-γ in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (IGRAs), are used for TB diagnosis. However, neither IGRAs nor the TST can separate acute TB from LTBI, and there is concern that responses in IGRAs may decline with time after infection. We have therefore evaluated the potential of the novel antigen heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA) for in vitro detection of LTBI. Methodology and Principal Findings HBHA was compared to purified protein derivative (PPD) and ESAT-6 in IGRAs on lymphocytes drawn from 205 individuals living in Belgium, a country with low TB prevalence, where BCG vaccination is not routinely used. Among these subjects, 89 had active TB, 65 had LTBI, based on well-standardized TST reactions and 51 were negative controls. HBHA was significantly more sensitive than ESAT-6 and more specific than PPD for the detection of LTBI. PPD-based tests yielded 90.00% sensitivity and 70.00% specificity for the detection of LTBI, whereas the sensitivity and specificity for the ESAT-6-based tests were 40.74% and 90.91%, and those for the HBHA-based tests were 92.06% and 93.88%, respectively. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-IT) test applied on 20 LTBI subjects yielded 50% sensitivity. The HBHA IGRA was not influenced by prior BCG vaccination, and, in contrast to the QFT-IT test, remote (>2 years) infections were detected as well as recent (<2 years) infections by the HBHA-specific test. Conclusions The use of ESAT-6- and CFP-10-based IGRAs may underestimate the incidence of LTBI, whereas the use of HBHA may combine the operational advantages of IGRAs with high sensitivity and specificity for latent infection."
https://openalex.org/W2118699779,"A large body of theoretical work suggests that analyses of variation at the maternally inherited mitochondrial (mt)DNA and the paternally inherited non-recombining portion of the Y chromosome (NRY) are a potentially powerful way to reveal the differing migratory histories of men and women across human societies. However, the few empirical studies comparing mtDNA and NRY variation and known patterns of sex-biased migration have produced conflicting results. Here we review some methodological reasons for these inconsistencies, and take them into account to provide an unbiased characterization of mtDNA and NRY variation in chimpanzees, one of the few mammalian taxa where males routinely remain in and females typically disperse from their natal groups. We show that patterns of mtDNA and NRY variation are more strongly contrasting in patrilocal chimpanzees compared with patrilocal human societies. The chimpanzee data we present here thus provide a valuable comparative benchmark of the patterns of mtDNA and NRY variation to be expected in a society with extremely female-biased dispersal."
https://openalex.org/W1994444150,"Mating has profound effects on the physiology and behavior of female insects, and in honey bee (Apis mellifera) queens, these changes are permanent. Queens mate with multiple males during a brief period in their early adult lives, and shortly thereafter they initiate egg-laying. Furthermore, the pheromone profiles of mated queens differ from those of virgins, and these pheromones regulate many different aspects of worker behavior and colony organization. While it is clear that mating causes dramatic changes in queens, it is unclear if mating number has more subtle effects on queen physiology or queen-worker interactions; indeed, the effect of multiple matings on female insect physiology has not been broadly addressed. Because it is not possible to control the natural mating behavior of queens, we used instrumental insemination and compared queens inseminated with semen from either a single drone (single-drone inseminated, or SDI) or 10 drones (multi-drone inseminated, or MDI). We used observation hives to monitor attraction of workers to SDI or MDI queens in colonies, and cage studies to monitor the attraction of workers to virgin, SDI, and MDI queen mandibular gland extracts (the main source of queen pheromone). The chemical profiles of the mandibular glands of virgin, SDI, and MDI queens were characterized using GC-MS. Finally, we measured brain expression levels in SDI and MDI queens of a gene associated with phototaxis in worker honey bees (Amfor). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that insemination quantity significantly affects mandibular gland chemical profiles, queen-worker interactions, and brain gene expression. Further research will be necessary to elucidate the mechanistic bases for these effects: insemination volume, sperm and seminal protein quantity, and genetic diversity of the sperm may all be important factors contributing to this profound change in honey bee queen physiology, queen behavior, and social interactions in the colony."
https://openalex.org/W2023710681,"Chemical transmitters are either low molecular weight molecules or neuropeptides. As a general rule, neuropeptides activate only slow metabotropic receptors. To date, only one exception to this rule is known, the FMRFamide-activated Na(+) channel (FaNaC) from snails. Until now FaNaC has been regarded as a curiosity, and it was not known whether peptide-gated ionotropic receptors are also present in other animal groups. Nervous systems first evolved in cnidarians, which extensively use neuropeptides. Here we report cloning from the freshwater cnidarian Hydra of a novel ion channel (Hydra sodium channel, HyNaC) that is directly gated by the neuropeptides Hydra-RFamides I and II and is related to FaNaC. The cells expressing HyNaC localize to the base of the tentacles, adjacent to the neurons producing the Hydra-RFamides, suggesting that the peptides are the natural ligands for this channel. Our results suggest that neuropeptides were already used for fast transmission in ancient nervous systems."

At physiological concentration, Hsp90 predominantly forms dimers, but the function of full-length monomers in cells is not clear. Hsp90 contains three domains: the N-terminal and middle domains contribute directly to ATP binding and hydrolysis and the C domain mediates dimerization. To study the function of Hsp90 monomers, we used a single-chain strategy that duplicated the C-terminal dimerization domain. This novel monomerization strategy had the dual effect of stabilizing the C domain to denaturation and hindering intermolecular association of the ATPase domain. The resulting construct was predominantly monomeric at physiological concentration and did not function to support yeast viability as the sole Hsp90. The monomeric construct was also defective at ATP hydrolysis and the activation of a kinase and steroid receptor substrate in yeast cells. The ability to support yeast growth was rescued by the addition of a coiled-coil dimerization domain, indicating that the parental single-chain construct is functionally defective because it is monomeric.

The ability to support yeast growth was rescued by the addition of a coiled-coil dimerization domain, indicating that the parental single-chain construct is functionally defective because it is monomeric. Among heat shock proteins, Hsp90 is unusual because it is not required for the proper folding of most cellular proteins (1Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12949-12956Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and instead is disproportionately linked to a select group of proteins required for receiving, transducing, and responding to environmental signals. The list of Hsp90 substrates continues to grow and includes over 40 kinases (2Zhao R. Davey M. Hsu Y.C. Kaplanek P. Tong A. Parsons A.B. Krogan N. Cagney G. Mai D. Greenblatt J. Boone C. Emili A.

Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies demonstrate that Hsp90 along with a handful of co-chaperones is required for many hormone receptors (including glucocorticoid, androgen, estrogen, and progesterone) to bind steroid ligand (3Pratt W.B.

V-src, the transforming tyrosine kinase from Rous sarcoma virus, was the first kinase to be identified as an Hsp90 substrate and is one of the most extensively studied. The transforming phenotype of v-src can be reversed with polyketide benzoquinone ansamycins including geldanamycin (GA), 2The abbreviations used are: GA, geldanamycin; Cm, concentration midpoint; GPD, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; WT, wild-type. which directly bind to Hsp90 (5Uehara Y. Hori M. Takeuchi T. Umezawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2198-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and blocks the association of v-src and Hsp90 (6Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Stimulated by these observations, Hsp90 has emerged as a promising molecular target for anti-cancer therapeutics (7Whitesell L. Lindquist S.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar). Recently, Hsp90 activation of the Chk1 kinase has been reconstituted in vitro and has been shown to require a set of co-chaperones that partially differ from those required for hormone receptors (8Arlander S.J.

As with hormone receptors, the molecular mechanism of Hsp90 activation of v-src and other kinases remains to be determined. How does Hsp90 dimerization contribute to its function in cells? Structurally, Hsp90 contains an N-terminal domain that binds nucleotide, a middle domain, and a C-terminal dimerization domain (Fig. 1). Truncations of Hsp90 that lack the C domain are largely monomeric (9Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and do not support yeast viability (10Louvion J.F. Warth R. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These results do not demonstrate that dimerization of Hsp90 is essential because the C domain may contribute other functional properties in addition to dimerization. The deletion of a loop from the C domain (582-601) that is largely solvent exposed (11Ali M.M. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Meyer P. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) prevents yeast viability (10Louvion J.F. Warth R. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), suggesting that dimerization is not the only essential role of the C domain. In addition, a point mutation (A587T) in this same loop impairs the chaperoning of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in yeast (12Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Because Hsp90 activity requires co-chaperones and Hsp90 binds promiscuously to about 10% of the yeast proteome (2Zhao R. Davey M. Hsu Y.C. Kaplanek P. Tong A. Parsons A.B. Krogan N. Cagney G. Mai D. Greenblatt J. Boone C. Emili A. Houry W.A. Cell. 2005; 120: 715-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), it is important to study Hsp90 function in cells where all endogenous binding partners are present. To rigorously test how dimerization affects Hsp90 function in cells requires a full-length Hsp90 monomer. The ATPase activity of Hsp90 is required for cellular function, although the molecular mechanism that couples ATP hydrolysis to substrate activation is poorly understood. Consistent with its role in signal transduction, Hsp90 is required for viability in all eukaryotes that have been tested (yeast, flies, and worms) (13Borkovich K.A. Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. Taulien J. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3919-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 14Birnby D.A. Link E.M. Vowels J.J. Tian H. Colacurcio P.L. Thomas J.H.

Structural and biochemical studies demonstrate that Hsp90 is a “split” ATPase with catalytic amino acids from both the N (Glu33) and M (Arg380) domains contributing to hydrolysis (11Ali M.M. Roe S.M. Vaughan C.K. Meyer P. Panaretou B. Piper P.W. Prodromou C. Pearl L.H. Nature. 2006; 440: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 16Chadli A. Bouhouche I. Sullivan W. Stensgard B.

Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Mutation of either of these catalytic amino acids impairs ATPase activity and does not support yeast viability as the sole Hsp90. Hsp90 point mutations that perturb the ATPase activity from 2 to 400% of the wild-type level can support yeast growth under non-stressful conditions (18Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, cell viability can tolerate a wide range of Hsp90 ATPase levels. Dimerization of Hsp90 has been implicated in ATP hydrolysis. NM constructs of yeast Hsp90 lacking the C-terminal dimerization domain have concentration-dependent specific ATPase activity (9Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the N and/or M domains can mediate weak dimerization that leads to increased ATPase activity. Consistent with this analysis, the disulfide cross-linking of truncated Hsp90 constructs increases their ATPase activity (19Wegele H. Muschler P. Bunck M. Reinstein J. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39303-39310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These studies raise the possibility that full-length Hsp90 monomers may be inactive for ATP hydrolysis. Studies with heterodimers made up of one full-length Hsp90 subunit and one C-domain, indicate that full-length/C-domain Hsp90 heteromers have about 30% the ATPase activity of wild-type (9Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), well within the 2 to 400% range previously observed to support yeast viability (18Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations have stimulated the current work to determine whether Hsp90 monomers are functional in cells. We have used a single-chain strategy to design a full-length NMCC Hsp90 monomer (Fig. 1) and analyzed its function in yeast cells. To our knowledge, this is a novel approach to making full-length monomers and relative to traditional strategies that mutagenize the dimer interface, has the advantage of stabilizing the dimerization domain to denaturation. We find that NMCC monomers do not function to support yeast growth, the activation of a kinase nor a hormone receptor substrate in yeast. Appending a coiled-coil dimerization motif to NMCC rescues dimerization and function, indicating that the parental NMCC construct is defective only because dimerization is impaired. Whereas Hsp90 monomers do not support yeast viability, wild-type Hsp90 monomers form transiently, on the same time scale as ATP hydrolysis, suggesting that they may play a role in the Hsp90 chaperone cycle. NMCC Hsp90 will provide a tool to further explore the biochemical properties of Hsp90 monomers and their role in the chaperone cycle. Construction of Hsp90 Variants—All Hsp90 constructs used in these studies were generated from the yeast HSP82 gene. To aid in protein purification and Western blot detection, a His6 tag (GGHHHHHHGGH) was appended to the N terminus of Hsp90 constructs. Constructs were cloned into pACYC for bacterial expression and into p414GPD for expression in yeast. The C-terminal domain of Hsp90 contains amino acids 542-709. Single-chain constructs of the C-terminal domain were constructed with amino acids 537-680 from HSP82 followed by the Gly-rich linkers outlined in Fig. 2 then by amino acids 542-709 from HSP82. The NMCC construct contains amino acids 1-680 from HSP82 followed by the 15-amino acid linker in Fig. 2, then amino acids 542-709 from HSP82. The NMCCcoil construct contains a coiled-coil sequence (GGGTSSVKELEDKNEELLSEIAHLKNEVARLKKLVGERTG) inserted after amino acid 678 of the second C domain of NMCC. Protein Production—All Hsp90 constructs were expressed in BLR(DE3) cells induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 5 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in Wash Buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm potassium chloride, 20 mm imidazole). Cell lysis was accomplished by treatment with lysozyme and sonication. After pelleting cell debris, lysates were incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). After rinsing the nickel resin extensively with Wash Buffer, Hsp90 protein was competitively eluted with Elution Buffer (200 mm imidazole, pH 7.5). EDTA was added to 10 mm to eluates that were subsequently dialyzed into Buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA). Protein samples were further purified by anion exchange chromatography using a Q Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare) eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm potassium chloride in Buffer A. As a final purification, protein samples were subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Sephacryl S300 column (GE Healthcare) in Buffer B (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm potassium chloride). Proteins were concentrated in Buffer B to ∼10 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra concentrators (Millipore). Protein concentrations were determined spectroscopically using extinction coefficients (m−1 cm−1) based on amino acid composition using the program Sednterp (Amgen) at 280 nm: WT (54,050), NMCC and NMCCcoil (64,860), C domain (10,810), and C-linker-C constructs (21,620). Circular Dichroism—CD measurements were acquired on a Jasco A-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit and an autotitrator. C domain spectra were acquired in a 1-mm path length cuvette at a subunit concentration of 20 μm in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, at 25 °C. All equilibrium urea titrations were performed in Buffer B at 25 °C. Protein denaturation was followed by monitoring the loss of ellipticity at 222 nm. Measurements at a subunit concentration of 2 μm were made in a cuvette with a 1-cm path length using an autotitrator with a mixing time of 600 s (determined to be more than three times greater than the time constant for unfolding at the Cm). For urea titrations at a subunit concentration of 20 μm, samples were manually mixed, allowed to equilibrate for 30 min, and measurements made in a 1-mm cuvette. Both the pre- and post-transition regions were fit to linear equations and used to replot the data as the fraction unfolded. The fraction unfolded plots were fit to two-state models with or without dimerization as appropriate and previously described (20Bowie J.U. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7139-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 21Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) using the program Kaleidograph (Synergy Software). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Equilibrium experiments were performed at 20 °C on a Beckman XLI instrument using absorbance optics and a Ti60 rotor. Absorbance profiles were taken at 12-h intervals, and overlapping profiles were used as a criterion for equilibration. For the C domain constructs, samples were analyzed at a subunit concentration of 50 μm in Buffer A with a rotor speed of 15,000 rpm and an equilibration time of 36 h. For full-length constructs, samples were analyzed at a subunit concentration of 12 μm in Buffer B with a rotor speed of 8,000 rpm and an equilibration time of 36 h. Absorbance profiles were fit to a single species model as previously described (22Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York1980Google Scholar) using the equation, c2(x)=c2(x0)exp{[M(1-Vp)ω2/2RT](x2-x02)}(Eq. 1) where c2(x) is the concentration at a radial distance of x, x0 is a reference point, M is the molecular weight, V is the partial specific volume, ρ is the buffer density, ω is the angular velocity, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the temperature. Data were fit in Kaleidograph using buffer density and V-bar values based on the buffer and amino acid composition and determined using the Sednterp program. Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—100-μl samples ranging in subunit concentration from 5 to 50 μm were analyzed using Buffer B and a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare). Absorbance at 280 nm was used to monitor the elution profile. Enzymatically Coupled ATPase Assay—ATP hydrolysis was enzymatically linked to NADH oxidation that was monitored spectroscopically (23Norby J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Hsp90 catalyzed ATP hydrolysis to generate ADP. Pyruvate kinase was used to convert ADP and phosphenolpyruvate to ATP and pyruvate. Lactose dehydrogenase was used to convert pyruvate and NADH to lactate and NAD with a corresponding drop in absorbance at 340 nm (Δϵ340 = 6220 m−1 cm−1). ATPase assays were performed at 37 °C. Both Hsp90 protein samples and ATPase components were pre-warmed, then mixed. Using a Bio50 Spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier temperature control unit (Cary) and a 1-cm path length cuvette, absorbance at 340 nm was measured at 15-s intervals (avoids photobleaching of NADH) for 10 min. The final concentration of ATPase components was 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP (Sigma), 0.17 mm NADH (Sigma), 0.67 mm phosphoenolpyruvate (Sigma), 0.01 mg/ml pyruvate kinase (Sigma), and 0.02 mg/ml lactose dehydrogenase (EMD Biosciences). The rate of NADH oxidation with 0.3 mm ADP was more than an order of magnitude greater than the highest rate observed with Hsp90 demonstrating that ATPase components are not rate-limiting. Rates were determined by fitting the change in absorbance versus time to a linear model, converting absorbance units to the amount of NADH oxidized and normalizing to the concentration of Hsp90. Fluorescent GA Binding—BODIPY-GA was synthesized as described (24Llauger-Bufi L. Felts S.J. Huezo H. Rosen N. Chiosis G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 3975-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). BODIPY-GA concentration was determined by absorbance in methanol using an extinction coefficient of 80,000 m−1 cm−1 at 506 nm (25Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.Second Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, Boston, MA1999Crossref Google Scholar) and was in close agreement with the weighed mass of BODIPY-GA used. 3 μm BODIPY-GA was preincubated in assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40) with 10 mm dithiothreitol for 4 h at room temperature to convert GA to the high-affinity hydroquinone form (26Maroney A.C. Marugan J.J. Mezzasalma T.M. Barnakov A.N. Garrabrant T.A. Weaner L.E. Jones W.J. Barnakova L.A. Koblish H.K. Todd M.J. Masucci J.A. Deckman I.C. Galemmo Jr., R.A. Johnson D.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5678-5685Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared in assay buffer with 5 mm dithiothreitol containing 1 μm reduced BODIPY-GA and wild-type or NMCC Hsp90 ranging from 0.1 to 3.3 μm. These concentrations of Hsp90 and BODIPY-GA are both well above the 5 nm Kd determined for human Hsp90 and BODIPY-GA (26Maroney A.C. Marugan J.J. Mezzasalma T.M. Barnakov A.N. Garrabrant T.A. Weaner L.E. Jones W.J. Barnakova L.A. Koblish H.K. Todd M.J. Masucci J.A. Deckman I.C. Galemmo Jr., R.A. Johnson D.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 5678-5685Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Samples were equilibrated for 10 min at room temperature and fluorescence anisotropy measurements were made in a 0.3-cm path length cuvette on a PTI QM-4SE spectrofluorometer with excitation set to 488 nm and emission at 510 nm. Sole Hsp90 in Yeast—The haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains iG170Da (1Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12949-12956Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and ECU82a (12Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) are derivatives of W303 in which both endogenous Hsp90 genes, HSP82 and HSC82, are knocked out. In strain iG170Da, the temperature-sensitive G170D mutant of HSP82 is chromosomally integrated and expressed from a GPD promoter. In strain ECU82a, wild-type HSC82 is constitutively expressed from pKAT6, a URA3 marked 2-μm (hi copy) plasmid that is amenable to negative selection. To test the ability of our Hsp90 constructs to support yeast viability, we generated them in p414GPD (27Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar), a TRP marked CEN plasmid with a strong constitutive promoter. Lithium acetate was used to introduce our Hsp90 constructs into iG170Da and ECU82a and plating in the absence of tryptophan was used to select for transformants. Transformants were grown in liquid media lacking tryptophan to an A600 of 0.7, serially diluted, and plated under permissive or non-permissive conditions. All samples were grown and plated in synthetic media lacking tryptophan and with 2% dextrose as a sugar source. For strain iG170Da, 25 °C was permissive and 37 °C was non-permissive. Strain ECU82a was grown at 25 °C, in the absence or presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid, which selects for loss of the pKAT6 plasmid. To determine the expression level of our Hsp90 constructs in ECU82a, liquid cultures in minimal media were grown to a cell density of 5 × 107 cells/ml determined with a hemacytometer. Cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads and resuspension in SDS. Proteins from the lysis of 107 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and the expression level quantified by Western blotting against the His6 epitope tag. A standard curve was generated using purified Hsp90 added to lysates from cells that did not express any epitope-tagged Hsp90. V-src Assay—Plasmid Y316v-srcv5 was generated from Y316v-src (12Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) and contains v-src with a C-terminal v5 epitope tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) under a galactose-regulated promoter on a URA3-marked CEN plasmid. Lithium acetate was used to introduce Y316v-srcv5 into iG170Da cells and plating in the absence of uracil was used to select for transformants. To these cells we introduced our Hsp90 constructs on p414GPD plasmids. On plates, cells were grown with dextrose as the sugar source to prevent v-src expression. Liquid cultures were grown in synthetic raffinose media without uracil and tryptophan at 25 °C to a cell density of about 5 × 106 cells/ml (determined with a hemocytometer). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in media with either 2% raffinose or galactose as the sugar source pre-warmed to 38 °C (to inactivate G170D Hsp90). Cells were grown in a shaking incubator at 35 °C for 6 h. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation, washed once with water, and frozen at -80 °C. The frozen cell pellets were lysed by vortexing with glass beads in Src Lysis Buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate to inhibit dephosphorylation, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by addition of SDS to 2%. Protein concentration in these SDS lysates was assessed using the BCA assay (Pierce). Samples (2 μg of protein) were subject to SDS-PAGE and phosphotyrosine levels quantified by Western blot analysis with antibody 4G10 (Upstate) in the presence of 0.1% Tween 20. The level of v-src was quantified by Western blot analysis (20 μg of protein/lane) with α-v5 antibody (Invitrogen). GR Assay—P2A/GRGZ (12Nathan D.F. Lindquist S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3917-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) is a 2-μm ADE2 plasmid that contains rat glucocorticoid receptor expressed from the constitutive GPD promoter and the β-galactosidase reporter under the control of three glucocorticoid response elements. We introduced P2A/GRGZ together with our p414GPD Hsp90 constructs into iG170Da cells. Cells were grown in synthetic dextrose media lacking tryptophan and adenine at 25 °C to a cell density of about 5 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in media prewarmed to 38 °C (to inactivate G170D Hsp90). 15-ml cultures were grown in a shaking incubator at 35 °C for 5 min. Deoxycorticosterone dissolved in ethanol was added to final concentrations of 0, 0.08, 0.4, 2, 10, or 50 μm (final concentration of ethanol was 0.1% in all cases). Cells were grown for a further 60 min at 35 °C and collected by centrifugation. After washing once with water, cell pellets were frozen at -80 °C. Cells were lysed by vortexing with glass beads in βGal Lysis Buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.3, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After removing cell debris, protein concentration in the lysates was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). A total of 10 μg of lysate was reacted for 15 min in a total volume of 80 μl of 1 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactoside (Sigma) in βGal Lysis Buffer. The reaction was stopped by adding 80 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate. Reporter activity was quantified by monitoring the absorbance at 420 nm. GR assays were repeated three times starting from fresh yeast colonies. C Domain Has Marginal Stability to Urea Denaturation—The goal of our engineering efforts is to generate a natively folded full-length Hsp90 monomer that has one ATPase site. We considered traditional dimer disruption strategies, but were concerned that mutations at the dimer interface might destabilize the C domain causing it to misfold. To address this concern, we monitored the stability of the C domain. The stability of a protein is a measure of its capacity to tolerate destabilizing mutations and still fold (28Bornberg-Bauer E. Chan H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10689-10694Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We analyzed the stability of the isolated C domain to urea-induced unfolding. In the absence of urea, the circular dichroism spectrum of the C domain has minima at 208 and 222 nm indicating that it forms a folded structure with significant helical content (supplemental Fig. S1). We used CD to monitor the transition of the isolated C domain from folded to unfolded as a function of urea concentration (Fig. 1B). The urea concentration midpoint (Cm) of denaturation increases with higher C domain concentration (2.38 m urea at 2 μm and 2.74 m urea at 20 μm). The dependence of Cm on protein concentration indicates that dimerization and protein folding are coupled. At concentrations of Hsp90 (9Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) where monomers become populated (the midpoint of association is 60 nm), our results indicate that the C domain would be marginally stable to denaturation. Taking these observations into account, we decided upon a monomerization strategy that would enhance the stability of the C domain (Fig. 1C). Duplication of the C domain in NMCC should both increase the stability of the C domain to denaturation and disfavor intermolecular association. Thus NMCC should have one ATPase site per molecule. Isolated Single-chain C Domain Is Stable and Monomeric—With the aim of generating a single-chain C domain that is both monomeric and stable, we generated CC constructs separated by variable length glycine-rich linkers (Fig. 2A). Based on the crystal structure of Hsp90, the flexible linkers need to span a distance of 27 Å. Whereas 8 amino acids in a fully extended conformation can span this distance, previous single-chain studies have found that a greater number of amino acids is required to avoid strain and maximize stability (29Robinson C.R. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5929-5934Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We made glycine-rich linkers of 11, 15, and 19 amino acids based on a proteolytically stable loop in bacteriophage gene-3 protein that had been used in a previous single-chain study (30Martin A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Nature. 2005; 437: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). All three single-chain constructs (C11C, C15C, and C19C) expressed to high levels in Escherichia coli, were readily purified, highly soluble, and had CD spectra similar to the wild-type C domain (Fig. S1). At a subunit concentration of 2 μm, we observe that C11C, C15C, and C19C all have increased stability to urea denaturation relative to wild type (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the effective concentration caused by the covalent single-chain linkages is greater than the concentration of wild-type protein (2 μm). The 15-amino acid linker (C15C) was the smallest link eliciting the greatest stability and was chosen for further analysis. The increased stability of C15C could be caused by either a high effective concentration of covalently linked subunits as designed, or from unanticipated oligomerization. To differentiate between these possibilities, we analyzed the solution oligomeric state of C15C using equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (Fig. 2C). The distribution of C15C"
https://openalex.org/W2087354536,"The eukaryotic 20 S proteasome is formed by dimerization of two precursor complexes containing the maturation factor Ump1. β7/Pre4 is the only one of the 14 subunits forming the 20 S proteasome that is absent from these precursor complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Increased expression of Pre4 leads to a reduction in the level of precursor complex, indicating that Pre4 incorporation into these complexes is rate-limiting for their dimerization. When we purified these precursor complexes, we observed co-purification of Blm10, a large protein known to attach to the α ring surface of proteasomes. In contrast to single mutants lacking either Blm10 or the C-terminal extension of Pre4, a mutant lacking both grew extremely poorly, accumulated very high levels of precursor complexes, and was impaired in β subunit maturation. The effect of blm10Δ on proteasome biogenesis is modest, apparently because the 19 S regulatory particle is capable of substituting for Blm10, as long as precursor complex dimers are stabilized by the Pre4 C terminus. We found that a mutation (sen3/rpn2) affecting the Rpn2 subunit inhibits attachment of the 19 S activator to the 20 S particle or its precursors. Although the sen3 mutation alone had no apparent effect on precursor complex dimerization and active site maturation, the sen3 blm10 double mutant was impaired in these processes. Together these data demonstrate that Blm10 and the 19 S activator have a partially redundant function in stabilizing nascent 20 S proteasomes and in promoting their activation.

Together these data demonstrate that Blm10 and the 19 S activator have a partially redundant function in stabilizing nascent 20 S proteasomes and in promoting their activation. The multicatalytic protease, termed “26 S proteasome,” provides the main and essential proteolytic activity in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell (1Baumeister W. Walz J. Zühl F. Seemüller E. Cell. 1998; 92: 367-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). The main function of this protease is to degrade polyubiquitylated substrates, which include abnormal as well as regulatory proteins. Because of these properties, the proteasome has become an interesting drug target with potential in the treatment of cancer (2Adams J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is composed of the catalytic core particle (CP), 4The abbreviations used are: CP, core particle; RP, regulatory particle; CTE, C-terminal extension; HA, hemagglutinin; FH-Ump1, FLAG-His6-tagged Ump1. termed the “20 S proteasome,” and two 19 S regulatory particles (RPs), also known as PA700 activator complexes (3Hanna J. Finley D. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2854-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic 20 S proteasome is assembled from 14 distinct subunits, 7 of the α type and 7 of the β type. The overall α7β7β7α7 structure of this particle is characterized by the presence of two identical halves, each comprising a ring of seven α subunits and a ring of seven β subunits (4Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar, 5Unno M. Mizushima T. Morimoto Y. Tomisugi Y. Tanaka K. Yasuoka N. Tsukihara T. Structure. 2002; 10: 609-618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The two inner β rings contact each other and form the catalytic chamber of the CP. Five of the β subunits are synthesized as precursors with N-terminal propeptides (6Heinemeyer W. Ramos P.C. Dohmen R.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1562-1578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three of these subunits, β1, β2, and β5, provide the postacidic, the tryptic, and the chymotryptic activities, respectively (7Arendt C.S. Hochstrasser M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7156-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 8Heinemeyer W. Fischer M. Krimmer T. Stachon U. Wolf D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25200-25209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The two outer α rings contact the β rings on one side, and the base of the 19 S RP or alternative activator complexes on the other side. The 19 S RP is composed of two subcomplexes, the base and the lid, that are linked by the Rpn10 subunit (9Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). The base is composed of six ATPase subunits (Rpt1–Rpt6) and three non-ATPase subunits (Rpn1, Rpn2, and Rpn13) (3Hanna J. Finley D. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2854-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The 19 S RP has multiple roles in proteasome function. It recognizes ubiquitylated proteins either directly or indirectly and mediates their unfolding and translocation into the CP. In addition, the 19 S RP serves as an interaction platform for numerous other proteins, including ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitylating enzymes (3Hanna J. Finley D. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 2854-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10Demartino G.N. Gillette T.G. Cell. 2007; 129: 659-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Aside from the 19 S RP, several activator complexes have been described that can alternatively attach to the 20 S proteasome and activate its proteolytic function. However, only the 19 S RP appears to promote the degradation of ubiquitylated proteins. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the HEAT repeat protein Blm10, a homologue of mammalian PA200 (11Ustrell V. Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3516-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), has been reported to attach to 20 S CPs and to activate its peptide cleavage activity in vitro (12Schmidt M. Haas W. Crosas B. Santamaria P.G. Gygi S.P. Walz T. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13Iwanczyk J. Sadre-Bazzaz K. Ferrell K. Kondrashkina E. Formosa T. Hill C.P. Ortega J. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Blm10 (called Blm3 in some publications), however, has also been detected in association with proteasome precursor complexes (14Fehlker M. Wendler P. Lehmann A. Enenkel C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15Li X. Kusmierczyk A.R. Wong P. Emili A. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2339-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The physiological function of Blm10 has remained unclear. 20 S CPs are assembled from “half-proteasome precursor complexes” containing unprocessed β subunits and maturation factor Ump1 (underpinning maturation of proteasome) (6Heinemeyer W. Ramos P.C. Dohmen R.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1562-1578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Krüger E. Kloetzel P.M. Enenkel C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Following dimerization of such complexes, autocatalytic processing and thereby activation of β1, β2, and β5 as well as degradation of Ump1 take place (17Chen P. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 86: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 18Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We have reported recently that a C-terminal extension (CTE) of S. cerevisiae β7/Pre4 serves two functions in 20 S CP biogenesis (19Ramos P.C. Marques A.J. London M.K. Dohmen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14323-14330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This extension emanates from one half of the CP to the other, where it intercalates between subunits β1/Pre3 and β2/Pup1, thereby promoting formation and stabilization of nascent CPs. Residues within the Pre4 CTE, in addition, contact residues in β1/Pre3 to stabilize a conformation that is required to promote β1/Pre3 processing and activity (4Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar, 19Ramos P.C. Marques A.J. London M.K. Dohmen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14323-14330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We report here that purified half-proteasome precursor complexes lack β7 but contain Blm10. Our results show that β7/Pre4 incorporation completes half-proteasome assembly and is rate-limiting for its dimerization. Whereas deletion of the BLM10 gene alone has little effect on 20 S CP formation, it causes growth inhibition, accumulation of half-proteasome precursor complexes, and β subunit processing defects when combined either with a deletion of the CTE of Pre4 or with a mutation in the SEN3/RPN2 gene. The strong synthetic effects of these mutations indicate that Blm10, the 19 S RP, and the Pre4 CTE have partly redundant functions in 20 S CP formation and maturation. Yeast Media and Strains—Yeast rich (YPD) and synthetic (SD) minimal media with 2% dextrose were prepared as described (19Ramos P.C. Marques A.J. London M.K. Dohmen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14323-14330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All strains are derivatives of JD47-13C (19Ramos P.C. Marques A.J. London M.K. Dohmen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14323-14330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Strains JD59 (ump1Δ) and JD139 (PUP1-HA2) have been described previously (18Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J.

A strain (AM19) expressing truncated Pre4 protein lacking its C-terminal 19 residues (Pre4-ΔCTE) was generated by two-step gene replacement. A similar two-step strategy was used to generate AM22, a derivative of AM19 that stably expressed N-terminally FLAG-His6-tagged Ump1 (FH-Ump1). Strains AM29 and AM47, which expressed HA2-tagged Blm10 were derived from JD47-13C and AM22, respectively, using a plasmid integration strategy as described (18Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Similar integrative strategies were used to generate strains AM75 (PRE4-HA2) and AM128 (pre4-ΔCTE-HA2). Strains AM36, AM74, and AM31 (all blm10Δ::KanMX4) were generated by amplifying the deletion cassette from the corresponding strain obtained from the EUROSCARF collection and introducing it into JD47-13C (wild type), AM19 (pre4-ΔCTE), or AM22, respectively. Strain DDY112-15a (sen3-1) (kindly provided by Dr. Mark Hochstrasser) was crossed to AM36 (blm10Δ) to produce sen3-1 blm10Δ double mutants. Identical results were obtained for several independent spore clones of this cross (data not shown). For overexpression of PRE4, PRE2, or UMP1 from the copper-inducible PCUP1, a set of 2μ/LEU2-based plasmids was generated. The parental plasmid pJDCEX1 was used as an empty vector control. Fractionation of Whole Cell Extracts by Gel Filtration, Electrophoresis, and Immunoblotting—S. cerevisiae cells were grown at 30 °C in SD or YPD medium to A600 of 1.0 ± 0.2. Protein extraction and fractionation on a Superose 6 column coupled to an ȦCTA fast protein liquid chromatography (GE Healthcare) as well as SDS-PAGE and immunoblots were performed as described previously (18Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The volume of a fraction was 600 μl, of which 40 μl were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteasomal Peptidase Activity Assays and Steady-state Immunoblots—Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in YPD media to A600 of 1.0 ± 0.2 and frozen. Cells were lysed with glass beads in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol). Cell debris was removed at 16,100 × g, and the total protein content in the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. For the chymotryptic activity, 5 μl of each crude extract were diluted to a final volume of 50 μl in extraction buffer containing 25 ng/μl of succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Bachem). The hydrolysis of the peptide with release of the fluorophore was monitored at 60-s intervals for 30 min at 37 °C. For SDS-PAGE, 10 μg of total protein from each extract were loaded per lane. Immunoblot analysis and quantification of signals using the Odyssey infrared imaging system were performed as described (20Palanimurugan R. Scheel H. Hofmann K. Dohmen R.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4857-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were monoclonal anti-HA (Covance), polyclonal anti-Pup1, or anti-Cim5/Rpt1. Purification of the “Half-proteasome” Complex and Characterization of Subunit Composition—Yeast cells (strain AM22) were grown in 1 liter of YPD at 30 °C until A600 = 3.0 and harvested at 3500 × g, washed with cold water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Cells were resuspended in cold FLAG buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 150 mm NaCl, and 15% glycerol) and lysed with the EmulsiFlex-C5 (Avestin) at 25,000 p.s.i. for 5 min. Cell debris was removed at 30,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with a 500-μl bed volume of anti-FLAG M2 EZview affinity resin (Sigma) for 90 min at 4 °C. The resin was then washed three times for 5 min each with 10 ml of FLAG buffer, and the bound material was eluted at 4 °C for 60 min in FLAG buffer containing 200 ng/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). The eluate was loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with colloidal Coomassie as described (21Neuhoff V. Stamm R. Pardowitz I. Arold N. Ehrhardt W. Taube D. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Protein bands were excised from the gel, and the proteins were eluted and trypsinated. The resulting peptides were used for protein mass fingerprint analysis. Purification and Characterization of Half-proteasome Precursor Complexes—Our previous studies have implicated the Pre4 CTE and maturation factor Ump1 in 20 S CP assembly and maturation (18Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 19Ramos P.C. Marques A.J. London M.K. Dohmen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14323-14330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Seeking further insights regarding the details of these processes, we purified the Ump1-containing proteasome precursor complex from S. cerevisiae cells. Because this complex is of low abundance in wild-type cells, we took advantage of our observation that the pre4-ΔCTE mutation results in a severalfold increase of its levels. Since Ump1 is unique to the half-proteasome precursor (i.e. it is absent from mature 20 and 26 S particles), we chose to link this maturation factor to a tag for affinity purification. Because Ump1 becomes enclosed during the dimerization of these precursor complexes (18Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), this strategy, in addition, has the advantage that binding of Ump1 to an affinity matrix should prevent dimerization. Since C-terminal tags of Ump1 are buried within the precursor complex (18Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), we fused a FLAG-His6 tag to its N terminus (FH-Ump1). We found this tag in combination with the pre4-ΔCTE mutation to further enhance accumulation of the precursor complex. Complexes containing FH-Ump1 were purified by a one-step protocol on a resin containing anti-FLAG antibody. Gel filtration analysis of the purified material confirmed that it exclusively contained proteasomal precursor complexes and no 20 or 26 S particles (Fig. 1A). Subunits of the purified precursor complex were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by peptide mass fingerprint analysis (Fig. 1B). This analysis revealed the presence of 13 of the 14 CP subunits. Remarkably, the missing subunit was β7/Pre4. In addition, we detected Ump1 and Blm10. Previous studies that used Ump1 fused at its C terminus with protein A for affinity purification similarly yielded complexes containing Blm10. These complexes, however, lacked β6 and β7 and contained undisclosed chaperones (14Fehlker M. Wendler P. Lehmann A. Enenkel C. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Lehmann A. Janek K. Braun B. Kloetzel P.M. Enenkel C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Based upon our experience, the differences between these preparations are probably due to the bulky C-terminal protein A domain, which may result in an incompletely assembled aberrant complex associated with molecular chaperones. As pointed out above, a short peptide tag at the C terminus of Ump1 was previously shown not to be accessible to anti-tag antibody in the context of the precursor complex, indicating that the C terminus of the protein points into the interior of the complex (18Ramos P.C. Höckendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). β7/Pre4 Incorporation Is a Rate-limiting Step in 20 S CP Formation—Our finding that β7/Pre4 is the only subunit present in mature 20 S proteasomes that is absent from purified half-proteasome precursor complexes suggested that it is the last subunit to be incorporated into such complexes, triggering their fast dimerization. Consistent with this assumption, in contrast to Pro-Pup1 (Fig. 2A), no significant amounts of β7/Pre4-HA were detected in fractions of a gel filtration that contained the half-proteasome precursor complex (Fig. 2B, fractions 21 and 22). Similar results were obtained with extracts derived from an otherwise identical untagged wild-type strain and detection with an anti-Pre4 antiserum (data not shown). Remarkably, aside from the absence of Pre4 in fractions 21 and 22, we also did not detect unassembled free Pre4 in these fractionation experiments. The latter finding suggested that Pre4 is a rate-limiting subunit that, following its synthesis, is rapidly incorporated into precursor complexes and drives their dimerization. Since the pre4-ΔCTE mutant accumulated higher levels of the precursor complex, we asked whether the truncated Pre4, which is impaired in 20 S CP formation, would be detectable in these complexes. This was not the case (Fig. 2B). We conclude that stable incorporation of Pre4 and 20 S CP formation mutually depend on each other. In contrast to what was observed for Pre4, we detected increased amounts of Blm10 in fractions containing proteasomal precursor complexes in the pre4-ΔCTE mutant in comparison with the wild type (Fig. 2C). These data are consistent with the results obtained after purification of precursor complexes using FH-Ump1 (Fig. 1) and indicate that Blm10 binds to precursor complexes lacking Pre4. Incorporation of β7/Pre4 Drives Dimerization of Proteasomal Precursor Complexes—The apparent lack of free Pre4 subunit and its absence from the precursor complex suggested that its incorporation coincides or is closely followed by precursor complex dimerization and that Pre4 availability should thus be rate-limiting. A comparison of proteasomal complexes in a wild-type strain with those in a strain overexpressing PRE4 supported this assumption (Fig. 3). Compared with the wild-type control, a strain overexpressing β7/Pre4 contained significantly lower amounts of the precursor complex bearing unprocessed β2/Pup1 (Fig. 3A). A quantitative immunoblot analysis of the relative amounts of unprocessed versus processed forms of Pup1 in unfractionated crude extracts corroborated this result (Fig. 3, B and C). Overexpression of β5/Pre2 or Ump1, in contrast, had no detectable effect on the relative amounts of proteasomal complexes. These data support the notion that the observed rate-limiting role for dimerization of precursor complexes is a specific function of Pre4. BLM10 Is Important for 20 S CP Formation and Maturation in the Pre4-ΔCTE Mutant—The presence of Blm10, a large protein reported to function as a regulatory complex that attaches to α rings of 20 S CPs (see Introduction), in our proteasome precursor preparations prompted us to ask whether its absence has an impact on proteasome biogenesis. The blm10Δ mutation had a very modest effect on this process, with relative amounts of unprocessed β2/Pup1 increased by ∼20% when cells were grown at a low temperature (15 °C; data not shown). No apparent effects were detectable on Pup1 processing or peptidase activity at 30 or 37 °C (Fig. 4) (data not shown). In comparison, already significantly higher levels of proteasome precursor were detected in the pre4-ΔCTE mutant. Both single mutants, moreover, did not display any detectable growth phenotype at 30 or 37 °C (Fig. 4A). The blm10Δ pre4-ΔCTE double mutant, in contrast, displayed a striking synthetic growth defect at 30 °C and was inviable at 37 °C (Fig. 4A). Biochemical analysis revealed that this mutant showed also dramatically reduced peptidase activity and was severely impaired in β2/Pup1 processing (Fig. 4, B and C). To investigate further which steps in proteasome biogenesis are affected, we compared the distribution of proteasomal complexes in this mutant with those of wild type and the single mutants (Fig. 4D). In the double mutant, we observed a striking accumulation of proteasomal precursor complexes, much stronger than in the pre4-ΔCTE single mutant. In contrast to the latter mutant, the double mutant moreover displayed a profound defect in 20 S CP maturation. Unprocessed β2/Pup1 was detected in fractions 13–21 containing the 20 and 26 S particles. Together these results indicate that Blm10 has a role in proteasome assembly and maturation. In the absence of Blm10, these processes appear to occur nearly normally, but destabilizing the nascent dimer by deletion of the CTE from Pre4 makes this role of Blm10 apparent. Similarly, the lack of the Pre4 CTE, although impairing precursor dimerization, has no apparent effect on β2/Pup1 maturation. Loss of the CTE, however, results in a dramatic impairment of β2/Pup1 processing in a strain lacking Blm10. Together, these observations indicate that both Blm10 and the Pre4 CTE stabilize nascent 20 S CPs, thereby promoting their maturation. The sen3 Mutation Inhibits Attachment of the 19 S RP to the 20 S Proteasome—The Rpn2/Sen3 protein is a subunit of the base subcomplex of the 19 S RP (9Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effect of the sen3-1 mutation (23DeMarini D.J. Papa F.R. Swaminathan S. Ursic D. Rasmussen T.P. Culbertson M.R. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6311-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) on proteasomal complexes by size fractionation (Fig. 5A). We observed a strikingly altered distribution of proteasomal complexes in fractions obtained by gel filtration. Although mature 20 S CP proteasomes, with or without attached 19 S RP, eluted in fractions 13–22 of wild-type extracts, they were detectable only in fractions 16–23 of sen3-1 extracts. The latter fractions typically contain the 20 S proteasome, whereas 20 S proteasomes capped with one or two 19 S RPs are distributed through fractions 13–18 (24Dohmen R.J. London M.K. Glanemann C. Ramos P.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 301: 243-254PubMed Google Scholar). This result indicated that sen3-1 inhibits assembly of the 19 S complex with the 20 S CP. Rpn2 and Blm10 Can Partially Substitute for Each Other in Stabilizing Nascent 20 S Proteasomes—The properties of the sen3-1 mutant described above allowed us to address the question of whether the 19 S RP plays a role in the assembly and maturation of the 20 S CP. Similar to the blm10Δ mutant (see above), the sen3-1 mutant alone, however, displayed neither an increase in half-proteasome precursors levels nor a defect in the processing of β2/Pup1. We therefore asked whether combining sen3-1 with blm10Δ would result in such defects, since this mutant would lack Blm10 entirely and have reduced functional 19 S RP. This double mutant grew more poorly than the sen3-1 single mutant and showed a strong accumulation of precursor complexes containing unprocessed β2/Pup1 (Fig. 5, A and B). We conclude that the 19 S RP can substitute for Blm10 in stabilizing nascent 20 S proteasomes and promoting their maturation. To verify this notion, we asked whether components of the 19 S RP could be detected in association with proteasome precursor complexes. Indeed, Rpt1, an ATPase subunit of the 19 S RP, reproducibly co-precipitated with FH-Ump1 from extracts of cells lacking Blm10 but was not detected in the precipitates when extracts from cells containing Blm10 were used (Fig. 5C). We conclude that the 19 S RP binds to half-proteasome precursor complexes in the absence of Blm10. In the present work, we have investigated the factors that control dimerization of proteasome precursor complexes and the maturation steps that go along with it in S. cerevisiae. β7/Pre4 Incorporation Triggers Dimerization of Half-proteasome Precursor Complexes—We found that purified half-proteasome precursor complexes contained Ump1, all seven α subunits, six of the seven β subunits (the missing one being β7/Pre4), and Blm10. These data are consistent with another report, which was published while our work was in the submission process (15Li X. Kusmierczyk A.R. Wong P. Emili A. Hochstrasser M. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2339-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These authors also suggested that Pre4 incorporation is a rate-limiting step in dimerization of precursor complexes, based upon the finding that overexpression of Pre4 suppressed the defects of several proteasome assembly mutants. Our data provide direct evidence for Pre4 incorporation being a rate-limiting step in proteasome assembly by demonstrating that overexpression of Pre4 in wild-type cells results in a profound enhancement of precursor complex dimerization (Fig. 3). Possible Regulatory Function of Pre4 in Activating Preassembled Precursor Complexes—The observation that β7/Pre4 is hardly detectable as a free subunit (Fig. 2) and that increased intracellular Pre4 concentration results in a strong reduction of the level of proteasome precursor complexes (Fig. 3) make this subunit an attractive candidate for regulatory responses. Similar to those of other proteasomal subunits, the promoter of the PRE4 gene contains so-called PACE elements that are recognized by transcriptional activator Rpn4 (25Mannhaupt G. Schnall R. Karpov V. Vetter I. Feldmann H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 26Dohmen R.J. Willers I. Marques A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 1599-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Rpn4 is a central factor in an autoregulatory feedback loop that controls co-expression of proteasome genes in response to impairment or overloading of the proteasome (27Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 28London M.K. Keck B.I. Ramos P.C. Dohmen R.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A comparison of expression profiles of PRE4 with those of other proteasome subunit genes revealed, aside from many similarities supporting their co-regulation, also a distinct strong response of PRE4 to repression of GLC7 (encoding a protein phosphatase) (available at the Saccharomyces Genome Database) (29Hughes T.R. Roberts C.J. Dai H. Jones A.R. Meyer M.R. Slade D. Burchard J. Dow S. Ward T.R. Kidd M.J. Friend S.H. Marton M.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that, under such conditions, PRE4 expression might be selectively up-regulated, resulting in an increased mobilization of proteasomal precursor complexes and thereby in elevated levels of functional proteasome.

https://openalex.org/W2072328648,"Rapid and transient elevations of Ca2+ within cellular microdomains play a critical role in the regulation of many signal transduction pathways. Described here is a genetic approach for non-invasive detection of localized Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) rises in live animals using bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Transgenic mice conditionally expressing the Ca2+-sensitive bioluminescent reporter GFP-aequorin targeted to the mitochondrial matrix were studied in several experimental paradigms. Rapid [Ca2+] rises inside the mitochondrial matrix could be readily detected during single-twitch muscle contractions. Whole body patterns of [Ca2+] were monitored in freely moving mice and during epileptic seizures. Furthermore, variations in mitochondrial [Ca2+] correlated to behavioral components of the sleep/wake cycle were observed during prolonged whole body recordings of newborn mice. This non-invasive imaging technique opens new avenues for the analysis of Ca2+ signaling whenever whole body information in freely moving animals is desired, in particular during behavioral and developmental studies."
https://openalex.org/W2171397286,"The 72-kDa zinc finger transcription factor PacC, distantly related to Ci/Gli developmental regulators, undergoes two-step proteolytic in response to alkaline ambient pH. Signaling protease cleavage of PacC(72) removes a processing-inhibitory C-terminal domain, making its truncated PacC(53) product accessible to a second processing protease, yielding PacC(27). Features of the proteolysis suggested the proteasome as a candidate protease. We constructed, using gene replacements, two missense active site mutations in preB, the Aspergillus nidulans orthologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae PRE2 encoding the proteasome beta5 subunit. preB1(K101A) is lethal. Viable preB2(K101R) impairs growth and, like its equivalent pre2(K108R) in yeast, impairs chymotryptic activity. pre2(K108R) and preB2(K101R) active site mutations consistently shift position of the scissile bonds when PacC is processed in S. cerevisiae and A. nidulans, respectively, indicating that PacC must be a direct substrate of the proteasome. preB2(K101R) leads to a 2-3-fold elevation in NimE mitotic cyclin levels but appears to result in PacC instability, suggesting an altered balance between and degradation. preB2(K101R) compensates the marked impairment in PacC(27) formation resulting from deletion of the efficiency determinant in PacC, further indicating direct proteasomal involvement in the formation of PacC(27). Deletion of a Gly-Pro-Ala-rich region within this efficiency determinant markedly destabilizes PacC. Arg substitutions of Lys residues within this efficiency determinant and nearby show that they cooperate to promote PacC processing. A quadruple Lys-to-Arg substitution (4K-->R) impairs formation of PacC(27) and leads to persistence of PacC(53). Wild-type PacC(53) becomes multiply phosphorylated upon alkaline pH exposure. Processing-impaired 4K-->R PacC(53) becomes excessively phosphorylated."
https://openalex.org/W2016414452,"Models describing the structural changes mediating Cys loop receptor activation generally give little attention to the possibility that different agonists may promote activation via distinct M2 pore-lining domain structural rearrangements. We investigated this question by comparing the effects of different ligands on the conformation of the external portion of the homomeric α1 glycine receptor M2 domain. Conformational flexibility was assessed by tethering a rhodamine fluorophore to cysteines introduced at the 19′ or 22′ positions and monitoring fluorescence and current changes during channel activation. During glycine activation, fluorescence of the label attached to R19′C increased by ∼20%, and the emission peak shifted to lower wavelengths, consistent with a more hydrophobic fluorophore environment. In contrast, ivermectin activated the receptors without producing a fluorescence change. Although taurine and β-alanine were weak partial agonists at the α1R19′C glycine receptor, they induced large fluorescence changes. Propofol, which drastically enhanced these currents, did not induce a glycine-like blue shift in the spectral emission peak. The inhibitors strychnine and picrotoxin elicited fluorescence and current changes as expected for a competitive antagonist and an open channel blocker, respectively. Glycine and taurine (or β-alanine) also produced an increase and a decrease, respectively, in the fluorescence of a label attached to the nearby L22′C residue. Thus, results from two separate labeled residues support the conclusion that the glycine receptor M2 domain responds with distinct conformational changes to activation by different agonists.

Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1051-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). They comprise an assembly of five subunits that are each composed of a large N-terminal extracellular ligand-binding domain and four transmembrane α-helices (M1-M4). Cryo-electron microscopy images of the homologous Torpedo electropax nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) transmembrane region reveals that the pore-lining M2 domains are kinked radially inward to form a central constriction at the membrane midpoint (2Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). There is currently a great deal of interest in understanding how M2 domains move to open the channel. Although the original model proposed a drastic rotation of M2 domains about their long axes (3Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), more recent evidence suggests that there is little if any rotation during receptor activation (4Wilson G.G. Karlin A.

The central pore kink is likely to introduce a degree of structural discontinuity because the hydrogen bonds responsible for maintaining α-helix rigidity are most likely broken. The kink may therefore act as a swivel enabling the outer half of M2 to move asynchronously with the inner half, where the gate is most likely positioned. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest gating is mediated by a backbone rearrangement at this midpoint (7Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A.

In addition, a rate equilibrium free energy state analysis shows that the M2-M3 domain is positioned midway along the agonist-induced “conformational wave” that extends from the ligand binding domain to the gate (11Grosman C. Zhou M. Auerbach A. Nature. 2000; 403: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). These considerations imply that the outer part of M2 should be an informative place to investigate the structural basis of receptor activation, as the movements in this region should not reflect either those occurring at the ligand binding site or the activation gate. Thus, in this study we probe conformational changes at the 19′ and 22′ residues, near the external end of M2. Current models of Cys loop receptor activation consider only structural changes associated with transitions from the resting closed state to the agonist-induced open state (5Cymes G.D. Ni Y.

Relatively little attention has been given to the possibility that different agonists and pharmacological modulators may promote different structural conformations in the pore region. However, it has been suggested on the basis of substituted cysteine accessibility studies that the pore blocker, picrotoxin, can change the conformation of the outer GlyR pore region suggesting in turn that it may interact allosterically with agonist-induced conformational changes (14Hawthorne R. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35836-35843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our aim is to investigate the conformational changes induced by agonists, antagonists, and allosteric modulators by covalently labeling different residues near the extracellular M2 boundary with the sulfhydryl-reactive fluorophores, methanethiosulfonate-rhodamine (MTSR) and tetramethylrhodamine-maleimide (TMRM), and simultaneously measuring current changes and fluorescence changes (15Dahan D.S. Dibas M.I. Petersson E.J. Auyeung V.C. Chanda B. Bezanilla F. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A particular advantage of the GlyR is that it displays little or no desensitization thereby facilitating the quantitation of ligand-induced fluorescence spectral shifts. Chemicals—Glycine, CaCl2, MgCl2, KCl, NaCl, and glycerol were all purchased from Ajax Finechem (Seven Hills, New South Wales, Australia). HEPES was purchased from Amresco (Solon, OH). Sulforhodamine methanethiosulfonate (MTSR, Toronto Research Chemicals, North York, Ontario, Canada) and tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (TMRM, Invitrogen) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored at -20 °C. Picrotoxin (Sigma), ginkgolide C (Tauto Biotech Co., Shanghai, China), and ivermectin (Sigma) were dissolved in Me2SO and stored at -20 °C. Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) was purchased from Sigma and stored at 4 °C. Strychnine (Sigma) was dissolved in water and stored at -20 °C. Taurine (Sigma) and β-alanine (Sigma) were also dissolved in water and stored at 4 °C. Molecular Biology—The human GlyR α1 subunit cDNA was subcloned into the pGEMHE vector. All constructs used in this study contained the functionally silent C41A mutation, which eliminated the sole uncross-linked extracellular sulfhydryl group (19Lynch J.W. Han N.L. Haddrill J. Pierce K.D. Schofield P.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2589-2599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis to generate the R19′C, S21′C, and L22′C mutants was performed with the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Successful incorporation of the mutations was confirmed through automated sequencing of the entire cDNA coding region. The mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used to generate capped mRNA for oocyte injection. mRNA concentrations were adjusted to 200 pg/nl and aliquots stored at -70 °C. Oocyte Preparation, Injection, and Labeling—Female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express, France) frogs were anesthetized, and stage VI oocytes were removed from ovaries and washed thoroughly in OR-2 (2.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). The oocytes were incubated in collagenase (Sigma) in OR-2 for 2 h at room temperature, rinsed, and stored at 18 °C. All oocytes were injected with 10 ng of mRNA into the cytosol. To achieve the high levels of expression required for the detection of the fluorescent signal over the background (because of oocyte autofluorescence and nonspecific binding of the dye), the oocytes were incubated for 3-10 days after injection at 18 °C. The incubation solution contained 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 0.6 mm theophylline, 2.5 mm pyruvic acid, 50 μg/ml gentamycin (Cambrex Corp., East Rutherford, NJ), 5% horse serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), pH 7.4. To maximize surface expression of receptors prior to labeling, oocytes were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The oocytes were then transferred into ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) and stored on ice. For labeling, oocytes were transferred into the labeling solution containing 10 μm MTSR in ND96 for 25 s or 10 μm TMRM in ND96 for 60 min. The oocytes were then washed and stored in ND96 for up to 6 h before recording. All labeling steps were performed on ice. Voltage Clamp Fluorometry (VCF)—For VCF experiments, an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope (Nikon Instruments, Kawasaki, Japan) was equipped with a high-Q TRITC filter set (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT), a Plan Fluor ×40 objective lens (N.A. 0.6, WD 3.7-2.7 mm) (Nikon Instruments, Kawasaki, Japan), and a PhotoMax 200 photodiode detection system (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN) attached to the side port of the microscope. An excitation filter wheel including a shutter and an emission filter wheel were controlled through a Lambda 10-2 unit (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). A Lambda LS 175-watt xenon arc lamp served as a light source and was coupled to the microscope via a liquid light guide (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). The design of the custom-made recording chamber is described in Ref. 15Dahan D.S. Dibas M.I. Petersson E.J. Auyeung V.C. Chanda B. Bezanilla F. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10195-10200Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar. An automated perfusion system operated by a Valvebank 8 module (AutoMate Scientific, San Francisco, CA) was used for perfusion of the recording chamber. Electrodes for two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were filled with 3 m CsCl and moved by automated ROE-200 micromanipulators coupled to an MPC-200 controller (Sutter Instruments, Novarto, CA). Cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of -40 mV in all experiments, and currents were recorded using a Gene Clamp 500B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Current and fluorescence traces were acquired at 200 Hz via a Digidata 1322A interface and Clampex 9.2 software (Molecular Devices). The fluorescence signal was further digitally filtered at 1-2 Hz with an eight-pole Bessel filter for analysis and display. The base line was corrected for bleaching where appropriate. All values for changes in fluorescence indicate an increase in fluorescence, unless stated otherwise. The empirical Hill equation, fitted with a nonlinear least squares algorithm (SigmaPlot 9.0, Systat Software, Point Richmond, CA), was used to obtain half-maximal concentrations (EC50 or IC50) and Hill coefficient (nH) values for ligand-induced activation and inhibition. All results are expressed as means ± S.E. of the mean of five or more independent experiments. Spectral Analysis—For spectral analysis a MicroSpec 2150i (Acton Research Corp., Acton, MA) coupled to an ORCA-ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) replaced the photodiode detection system on the side port of the microscope. The spectrometer was operated using SpectraPro mono-chromator software (Acton Research Corp., Acton, MA). For excitation, a HQ535/×50 filter was used in combination with a Q565LP dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT); no emission filter was used. Prior to the experiment, the spectrometer was calibrated using the 434, 546, and 577 nm lines of a mercury lamp spectrum. To analyze spectra, the image of the region of interest to be monitored was aligned with the slit of the spectrometer. Fluorescence from the region of interest was reflected onto the grating (300 g/mm; 500 nm blaze), and the extracted spectrum was imaged on the ORCA-ER CCD (chip size 1344 × 1024 pixels) using Meta-Morph 6.2 (Universal Imaging Corp., Downington, PA). The x axis of the resulting “spectral image” represents the wavelength dimension, whereas the y axis represents the one-dimensional spatial dimension of the slit. The wavelength coverage for this combination of grating and camera was 170 nm. Adjacent averaging (15 points) was used to smooth recorded spectra (ORIGIN 6.0, Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). Specific MTSR Labeling of the α1R19′C GlyR—Fig. 1A shows examples of glycine-evoked currents recorded from oocytes injected with α1WT RNA (upper panel) or mutant α1R19′C RNA (lower panel). The averaged glycine dose-response curves are shown in Fig. 1C. In this and all subsequent figures displaying dose-response curves, the continuous lines represent fits of the Hill equation to the averaged points. Table 1 shows the mean EC50 and nH values, determined by averaging the parameters determined from curve fits to individual dose responses. Table 1 also shows the mean Imax values. As reported previously (20Han N.L. Clements J.D. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19559-19565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the α1R19′C mutation results in a dramatically decreased glycine sensitivity. The mean Imax was not significantly different in α1R19′C relative to α1WT receptors (9.3 ± 1.6 μA, n = 5, versus 10.0 ± 0.6 μA, n = 9). The effect of MTSR labeling on glycine-evoked currents was also studied. As shown in the example in Fig. 1B (upper panel), our standard MTSR labeling protocol produced no significant change (+11.7 ± 8.1%, n = 8) in the magnitude of currents activated by EC10 (5 μm) glycine in α1WT GlyRs (Fig. 1B, upper panel). However, EC10 (1 mm) glycine currents were strongly potentiated in α1R19′C GlyRs following MTSR labeling with a mean current increase of 471 ± 68% (n = 6) (e.g. Fig. 1B, lower panel). As shown in Fig. 1C, this was caused by a leftward shift in the α1R19′C GlyR glycine EC50 value, although the nH remained unchanged (Table 1). As expected, the mean glycine EC50 of the α1WT GlyR was not significantly changed by the MTSR labeling procedure (Fig. 1C and Table 1). Fig. 1D shows a model of three nAChR M2 helices (based on Protein Data Bank code 2BG9), one of which shows the approximate relative locations of the labeled rhodamine 5H. A. Lester and M. I. Dibas, manuscript in preparation. and the 9′ leucine residue thought to be part of the channel gate.TABLE 1Summary of results for glycine-evoked current and fluorescence recordingsConstructEC50nHnImaxΔFmaxnμMμA%αWT unlabeled21.5 ± 0.12.9 ± 0.1510.0 ± 0.6NA9αWT labeled19.1 ± 0.13.0 ± 0.168.7 ± 0.6NA6αS21′C unlabeled21.1 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.156.8 ± 0.3NA5αS21′C labeled24.3 ± 0.61.9 ± 0.136.2 ± 0.4NA3αS22′C unlabeled781.0 ± 7.21.2 ± 0.177.3 ± 0.8NA7αS22′C labeled215.7 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.167.7 ± 0.4NA6αR19′C unlabeled4450 ± 1901.7 ± 0.179.3 ± 1.6NA5αR19′C labeled994 ± 141.7 ± 0.178.3 ± 0.6NA19αR19′C ΔF1074 ± 461.5 ± 0.17NA21.4 ± 1.919 Open table in a new tab Glycine-evoked Changes in Fluorescence Intensity at R19′C—MTSR treatment of oocytes injected with α1R19′C mRNA resulted in an ∼3.5-fold increase in resting fluorescence compared with that observed in identically treated uninjected oocytes or oocytes injected with α1WT mRNA (data not shown). VCF experiments showed that glycine application produced changes in fluorescence intensity (ΔF) in α1R19′C-injected oocytes that were coincident in time with the activated chloride current (ΔI) (Fig. 2A), with relative changes in fluorescence (ΔF/F) regularly reaching 20% at saturating glycine concentrations. In contrast, no significant ΔF was ever observed with uninjected or α1WT-injected oocytes. When normalized, the ΔI and ΔF glycine dose responses were virtually superimposed (Fig. 2B and Table 1), strongly suggesting a tight coupling between conformational changes at the 19′ residue and at the channel gate during glycine-induced activation. Spectral analysis of the fluorescence signal from MTSR-labeled α1R19′C GlyRs revealed that the fluorescence increase was accompanied by an ∼10 nm blue shift (n = 6) in the MTSR emission peak during full receptor activation (Fig. 2, C and D). The magnitude of this shift was concentration-dependent, with EC50 (1 mm) glycine producing roughly half of the shift produced by a saturating (20 mm) glycine concentration (Fig. 2, C and D). The blue shift in the MTSR emission peak is characteristic of an increase in hydrophobicity in the fluorophore environment, most likely reflecting a movement of the fluorophore to a more hydrophobic environment in the open state (15Dahan D.S. Dibas M.I. Petersson E.J. Auyeung V.C. Chanda B. Bezanilla F. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10195-10200Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As expected, MTSR-incubated oocytes expressing α1WT GlyRs did not show ΔF or spectral shifts (Fig. 2D). Effects of Other Agonists on R19′C Fluorescence Changes—The anti-helminthic compound, ivermectin, binds to an as yet unidentified binding site and activates the GlyR in an irreversible manner (21Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12556-12564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To confirm the previous conclusion that it activates the GlyR via a different mechanism from glycine (21Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12556-12564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we sought to compare the relationship between ΔI and ΔF produced by ivermectin with that produced by glycine. In MTSR-labeled α1R19′C GlyRs, 10 μm ivermectin evoked slowly developing currents that were roughly double the size of those produced by 1 mm glycine (203 ± 30%, n = 10). Despite this large current, no significant increase in the fluorescence intensity was ever observed (e.g. Fig. 3A). Indeed, the mean fluorescence change in eight oocytes showing robust glycine currents, the ΔF response was only 0.5 ± 0.1%. As observed previously (21Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12556-12564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the currents evoked by 10 μm ivermectin were only weakly sensitive to strychnine, with 10 μm strychnine reducing current magnitude by 18.9 ± 0.7% (n = 4, Fig. 3B). No ivermectin-gated currents were observed in uninjected oocytes (n = 3). Taken together, these results confirm that ivermectin activates GlyRs by a mechanism different from glycine. Taurine and β-alanine are low efficacy agonists of α1WT GlyRs, with taurine having a lower efficacy than β-alanine (22Lewis T.M. Schofield P.R. McClellan A.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 361-374Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both compounds are converted into antagonists by a variety of R19′ mutations, including R19′C (20Han N.L. Clements J.D. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19559-19565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 23Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Pierce K.D. French C.R. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These actions suggest that taurine and β-alanine bind to the α1R19′C GlyR without activating the receptor and thereby they act as classical competitive antagonists of glycine binding. If this hypothesis is correct, their binding should not produce significant ΔF.We sought to investigate whether these ligands produced a significant ΔF change upon receptor binding and, if so, whether this was spectrally similar to that produced by glycine. As expected, a50mm concentration of taurine did not produce a significant ΔI, although small, nA-sized currents were regularly recorded. Nevertheless, 50 mm taurine produced large changes in ΔF, with a mean value near 35% that evoked by a saturating glycine concentration (Fig. 3C). Both ΔI and ΔF stimulated by taurine were completely blocked by 10 μm strychnine (data not shown). Similar results were obtained with β-alanine. A 50 mm concentration of β-alanine evoked only a very small current (∼4% that produced by saturating glycine in the same oocyte), but it evoked a large ΔF that was roughly 60% that produced by a saturating glycine concentration (Fig. 3D). Again, both ΔI and ΔF stimulated by β-alanine were potently blocked by 10 μm strychnine (data not shown). The taurine-activated current was too small to be fitted with confidence to the Hill equation (n = 8). However, Hill equation fits to taurine ΔF dose responses (Fig. 3E) from the same eight oocytes yielded a mean EC50 of 2.4 ± 0.4 mm and nH of 0.9 ± 0.1. Applications of increasing β-alanine concentrations revealed a close relationship between ΔF and ΔI with no significant differences in their EC50 and nH values (Fig. 3E). The ΔF dose response was fitted with a mean EC50 of 2.02 ± 0.34 mm and an nH of 0.8 ± 0.1, whereas the ΔI dose response was fitted with an EC50 of 2.61 ± 0.93 mm and an nH of 1.1 ± 0.4 (n = 6 for each). To facilitate comparison with glycine-mediated responses, Fig. 3E also shows the ΔI and ΔF dose response relationships for glycine activation. The fluorescence and current maxima for taurine and β-alanine were both normalized to those produced by glycine in the same oocyte. Given that the relationship between ΔI and ΔF produced by glycine activation was not preserved during receptor activation by taurine or β-alanine, we hypothesized that these compounds produced different conformational changes at the 19′ residue. We investigated this by measuring the spectral changes produced by both compounds. As shown in Fig. 3F, taurine binding produced no detectable spectral shift, whereas the spectral shift produced by β-alanine (∼5 nm) was much smaller than that produced by glycine (Fig. 3G). Together these results strongly suggest that the binding of these weak partial agonists results in different conformational changes from those produced by glycine. Fluorescence Responses of Other Labeled Residues in the Extracellular M2 Region—As the R19′C mutation impacts severely on receptor function, we assessed whether other cysteine mutants in the extracellular M2 region with less impact on receptor function show a similar pattern of differential responses to different agonists. A previous study (20Han N.L. Clements J.D. Lynch J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19559-19565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) showed that cysteine substitutions at the 21′ and 22′ positions disrupt receptor function to a lesser degree than the R19′C mutation. Thus, we focused on these two residues. When injected into oocytes, the α1S21′C GlyR exhibited a WT-like glycine EC50, although the nH was significantly reduced (Table 1). The α1S21′C-injected oocytes showed no evidence of labeling by either MTSR or TMRM. Incubation with MTSR or TMRM in the presence or absence of 100 μm glycine produced no significant ΔF in response to saturating (3 mm) glycine applications (n = 3 each; data not shown), and fluorophore labeling produced no change in α1S21′C GlyR electrophysiological properties (Table 1). We conclude that α1S21′C is either not labeled by these fluorophores or that it experiences no change in micro-environment during receptor activation. The α1L22′C GlyR showed robust expression with electro-physiological properties intermediate between those of α1WT and α1R19′C (Table 1). Importantly, taurine and β-alanine acted as strong partial agonists (see below), as at α1WT receptors. When receptors were labeled with MTSR, no change in ΔF could be detected, even at saturating (3 mm) glycine concentrations (n = 4) (Fig. 4A). However, following labeling by TMRM, α1L22′C-injected oocytes showed a small but significant ΔF (1.5 ± 0.3%, n = 13) at saturating glycine concentrations (Fig. 4A). TMRM labeling also produced a significant increase in the glycine sensitivity of α1L22′C GlyRs (Table 1 and Fig. 4B). The small size of these signals precluded quantitation or spectral analysis of the ΔF response. In contrast to the effect of glycine, application of saturating (10 mm) concentrations of taurine or β-alanine evoked a significant decrease in ΔF (Fig. 4, C and D). Taurine induced a maximal current of 1.7 ± 0.4 μA and a ΔF of -1.1 ± 0.2% (n = 8). β-Alanine induced a maximal current of 3.1 ± 0.3 μA and a ΔF of -1.1 ± 0.3% (n = 7). We then tested whether the sign of the fluorescence change simply depended on the size of the current or was indeed agonist-specific. Application of a low (100 μm) glycine concentration evoked currents of 1.6 ± 0.3 μA (n = 7), a value not significantly different from those evoked by 10 mm taurine (1.7 ± 0.4 μA). However, this concentration of glycine produced no significant ΔF (0.0 ± 0.1% compared with -1.1 ± 0.2%) (n = 7). A similar result was obtained for β-alanine, where currents induced by 300 μm glycine were not significantly different from those evoked by 10 mm β-alanine (3.8 ± 0.6 μA and 3.1 ± 0.3 μA, respectively), but the respective fluorescence changes were significantly different in size and sign (0.3 ± 0.2% compared with -1.1 ± 0.3%; both n = 7). Together these results demonstrate that glycine produces a different conformational change at L22′C relative to those produced by taurine and β-alanine. Effects of GlyR Inhibitors on R19′C Fluorescence Changes—We next sought to compare the effects on the relationship between ΔI and ΔF of a putative classical competitive antagonist, strychnine, an allosteric inhibitor, picrotoxin, and a putative classical channel blocker, ginkgolide C. The molecular pharmacology of each of these compounds at the GlyR has been reviewed recently (25Webb T.I. Lynch J.W. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2007; 13: 2350-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). When applied alone, strychnine did not evoke significant ΔI or ΔF changes, even at a concentration of 10 μm (Fig. 5A). However, when co-applied with 1 mm glycine, 10 μm s"
https://openalex.org/W2149091556,"Cardiac contraction and relaxation are regulated by conformational transitions of protein complexes that are responsible for calcium trafficking through cell membranes. Central to the muscle relaxation phase is a dynamic membrane protein complex formed by Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) and phospholamban (PLN), which in humans is responsible for ∼70% of the calcium re-uptake in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Dysfunction in this regulatory mechanism causes severe pathophysiologies. In this report, we used a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance, and coupled enzyme assays to investigate how single mutations at position 21 of PLN affects its structural dynamics and, in turn, its interaction with SERCA. We found that it is possible to control the activity of SERCA by tuning PLN structural dynamics. Both increased rigidity and mobility of the PLN backbone cause a reduction of SERCA inhibition, affecting calcium transport. Although the more rigid, loss-of-function (LOF) mutants have lower binding affinities for SERCA, the more dynamic LOF mutants have binding affinities similar to that of PLN. Here, we demonstrate that it is possible to harness this knowledge to design new LOF mutants with activity similar to S16E (a mutant already used in gene therapy) for possible application in recombinant gene therapy. As proof of concept, we show a new mutant of PLN, P21G, with improved LOF characteristics in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2031139287,"A recently proposed mechanism of protection for haemoglobin C (HbC; β6Glu→Lys) links an abnormal display of PfEMP1, an antigen involved in malaria pathogenesis, on the surface of HbC infected erythrocytes together with the observation of reduced cytoadhesion of parasitized erythrocytes and impaired rosetting in vitro. We investigated the impact of this hypothesis on the development of acquired immunity against Plasmodium falciparum variant surface antigens (VSA) encoding PfEMP1 in HbC in comparison with HbA and HbS carriers of Burkina Faso. We measured: i) total IgG against a single VSA, A4U, and against a panel of VSA from severe malaria cases in human sera from urban and rural areas of Burkina Faso of different haemoglobin genotypes (CC, AC, AS, SC, SS); ii) total IgG against recombinant proteins of P. falciparum asexual sporozoite, blood stage antigens, and parasite schizont extract; iii) total IgG against tetanus toxoid. Results showed that the reported abnormal cell-surface display of PfEMP1 on HbC infected erythrocytes observed in vitro is not associated to lower anti- PfEMP1 response in vivo. Higher immune response against the VSA panel and malaria antigens were observed in all adaptive genotypes containing at least one allelic variant HbC or HbS in the low transmission urban area whereas no differences were detected in the high transmission rural area. In both contexts the response against tetanus toxoid was not influenced by the β-globin genotype. These findings suggest that both HbC and HbS affect the early development of naturally acquired immunity against malaria. The enhanced immune reactivity in both HbC and HbS carriers supports the hypothesis that the protection against malaria of these adaptive genotypes might be at least partially mediated by acquired immunity against malaria."
https://openalex.org/W1967573348,"The mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type VII mouse was originally described as the adipose storage deficiency mouse because of its extreme lean phenotype of unknown etiology. Here, we show that adipose storage deficiency and lower leptin levels are common to five different lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs): MPSI, MPSIIIB, MPSVII, Niemann-Pick type A/B, and infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Elevated circulating pro-inflammatory proteins (VCAM1 and MCP1) were found in multiple LSDs. Multiple anti-inflammatory strategies (dexamethasone, MCP1 deficiency, M3 expression) failed to alter adiposity in LSD animals. All of the models had normal or greater caloric intake and lower to normal metabolic rate, fasting plasma glucose, non-esterified fatty acids, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Triglycerides were lower in the livers of MPSI mice, and the trend was lower in the muscle. Lipid absorption and processing in MPSI mice were indistinguishable from those in normal mice following oral gavage of olive oil. The increased lean mass of MPSI and MPSIIIB mice suggests a shift in adipose triglycerides to lysosomal storage. In agreement, MPSI livers had a similar total caloric content but reduced caloric density, indicating a shift in energy from lipids to proteins/carbohydrates (lysosomal storage). Enzyme replacement therapy normalized the caloric density within 48 h without reducing total caloric content. This was due to an increase in lipids. Recycling of stored material is likely reduced or nonexistent. Therefore, to maintain homeostasis, energy is likely diverted to synthesis at the expense of typical energy storage depots. Thus, these diseases will serve as important tools in studying the role of lysosome function in metabolism and obesity.

Haematol. 2005; 128: 413-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 2Cuervo A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 263: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). A deficiency in one or more of the enzymes involved in these pathways leads to the accumulation of partially degraded substrates. Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) 2The abbreviations used are: MPS, mucopolysaccharidosis; LSD, lysosomal storage disease; LAL, lysosomal acid lipase; NPAB, Niemann-Pick type A/B; INCL, infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. type VII is a lysosomal storage disease (LSD) caused by a deficiency in β-glucuronidase activity, which leads to the accumulation of partially degraded glycosaminoglycans as well as other material (3Birkenmeier E.

Notably, the original description identified this animal as the adipose storage deficiency mouse because of the paucity of adipose stores (5Beamer W. Coleman D. Mouse Newsletter. 1982; 67: 21Google Scholar). The etiology of this phenotype was unknown, and furthermore, the identification of β-glucuronidase deficiency (3Birkenmeier E. Davisson M. Beaver W.

S. A. 1993; 90: 6567-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) has not yielded a cause and effect relationship. The only other report of an adipose deficiency associated with a LSD is in the lysosomal acid lipase (LAL)-deficient mouse (7Du H. Heur M. Duanmu M. Grabowski G. Hui D. Witte D. Mishra J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LAL is the essential enzyme involved in the hydrolysis of triglycerides and cholesterol esters in the lysosome (8Du H. Duanmu M. Witte D. Grabowski G. Human Mol. Gen. 1998; 7: 1347-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Mice deficient in LAL accumulate triglycerides and cholesterol esters in liver, spleen, and the intestines (7Du H. Heur M. Duanmu M. Grabowski G. Hui D. Witte D. Mishra J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of adipose tissue is progressive because LAL mice are born with a normal fat distribution (9Du H. Dardzinski B. O'Brien K. Donnelly L. Am. J. Roentgenol. 2005; 184: 658-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). LAL mice have a higher food intake and similar body weight compared with control animals (7Du H. Heur M. Duanmu M. Grabowski G. Hui D. Witte D. Mishra J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These animals have similar plasma triglycerides and significantly higher non-esterified fatty acids compared with normal mice (7Du H. Heur M. Duanmu M. Grabowski G. Hui D. Witte D. Mishra J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that these mice are mobilizing their adipose stores. However, the cause or purpose of the mobilization is not understood. Changes in adiposity may not be surprising in LAL mice because the primary defect is in an enzyme responsible for normal lipid metabolism. However, our current understanding of the metabolic effects of lysosomal storage, especially on lipid metabolism, is limited. We report here that lysosomal storage results in a deficiency in adipose deposition regardless of the material being stored. MPSI, MPSIIIB, MPSVII, Niemann-Pick type A/B (NPAB), and infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL) mice have significantly reduced adiposity and were analyzed with a variety of metabolic tests. The results suggest that lysosomal storage is an energy storage depot that is inaccessible to the cell and body but requires energy to maintain, thereby contributing negatively to energy balance. As this negative contribution grows, it is likely to affect animal viability. Finally, this finding suggests that higher nutrient-rich caloric intake might impact progression of LSDs. Animal Models, Husbandry, and Common Treatments—The MPSI, MPSIIIB, MPSVII, NPAB, and INCL colonies are maintained as pedigreed colonies through strict brother-sister matings at Washington University by M. S. S. Affected and control mice were identified by PCR genotyping, with the exception of the INCL colony. INCL mice are bred as homozyotes, and a separate C57BL/6 colony served as a source of controls. All mice were fed high fat (9%) PicoLab Mouse Diet 20 (product code 5058) ad libitum (LabDiet, PMI Nutrition International, St. Louis, MO) from weaning. Unless stated otherwise, MPSI, MPSVII, NPAB, and INCL mice were analyzed at 5 months of age (∼23 weeks), and MPSIIIB mice were analyzed at 7 months of age (∼30 weeks). For fasting experiments, food was withheld from the animals for at least 4 h. Plasma Chemistries—Depending on the experiment and the mouse model analyzed, whole blood was harvested in EDTA either by heart puncture or from the saphenous vein of fasted animals. Blood obtained from mice bled from the saphenous vein was collected in heparinized capillary tubes (Fisher). Blood obtained by heart puncture was collected through a 26-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe. Plasma was collected by centrifugation at 2940 × g for 5 min. Total cholesterol (Sigma), triglycerides (Sigma), glucose (Sigma), and non-esterified fatty acids (Wako Chemicals USA Inc., Richmond, VA) were analyzed using commercial kits according to manufacturers' specifications. Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry Scanning—The body composition of anesthetized animals was determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (GE Lunar Corp., Madison, WI). Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry analysis is a noninvasive technique that allows for differentiation between lean tissue and fat tissue (10Pietrobelli A. Formica C. Wang Z. Heymsfield S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E941-E951PubMed Google Scholar). Adiposity is calculated as the percentage of the body that is fat. Food Intake—Animals were housed individually. For a period of either 5 (MPSI) or 7 (MPSIIIB, MPSVII, NPAB, and INCL) consecutive days, weighed food was provided, and what was left was exchanged and reweighed 23-25 h later. Food consumed was normalized to body weight on the day of collection. The data reported represent the food intake on the final day, which allowed time for the animals to acclimate to the isolation and daily manipulation. Indirect Calorimetry—A single-chamber indirect calorimetry system (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) was used to analyze the metabolic rate in mice in a fed state after a short acclimation period. The volume of oxygen consumed per body weight (ml/g/h) is reported. The last five readings (every 30s) were averaged. Tissue Triglycerides—Flash-frozen liver and muscle tissue from MPSI and control mice in a fed state were homogenized in a 2-ml mixture of CHCl3/MeOH (2:1, v/v). Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Subsequently, water was added, and samples were vortexed vigorously. After high speed centrifugation, the organic layer was extracted (500-800 μl) and transferred to a fresh tube. One microliter of organic solution containing triglycerides was analyzed in triplicate as described above under “Plasma Chemistries.” Bomb Calorimetry—Whole livers (including gall bladders) from fasted 23-week-old MPSI and control animals were freeze-dried. The whole sample was then ignited in a sealed oxygen-filled metal bomb submerged in a water bath of known volume (NP Analytical Laboratories, St. Louis). The whole system was maintained at a constant temperature. The heat generated by combustion was calculated from the rise in temperature of the water bath, taking into account the heat of ignition. One cal is defined as the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 g of water by 1 °C. Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests—Glucose tolerance testing was performed on fasted MPSI and control animals at 24-27 weeks of age, and insulin tolerance testing was performed at 25-28 weeks of age. Glucose tolerance testing was performed first, followed by insulin tolerance testing at least 1 week later. These tests were performed essentially as described previously (11Bernal-Mizrachi C. Weng S. Li B. Nolte L. Feng C. Coleman T. Holloszy J. Semenkovich C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Lipid Absorption Test—Fasted mice were injected intravenously with Triton WR-1339 (12.5 mg/0.2 ml of saline; Tyloxapol, Sigma) to block lipoprotein lipase-dependent lipolysis. Without delay, a blood sample was collected from the saphenous vein into heparinized microhematocrit tubes. Blood was expelled into 0.2-ml tubes and spun immediately at 2490 × g for 5 min to obtain plasma. Subsequently, 100 μl of olive oil was administered by oral gavage. Additional blood samples were collected hourly for a total of 4 h from the saphenous vein and processed as described above. Plasma was flash-frozen in liquid N2. This experiment was performed essentially as described previously (12Bijvelds M. Bronsveld I. Havinga R. Sinaasappel M. de Jonge H. Verkade H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: G646-G653Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). “Western Diet” Treatment—Twelve-week-old MPSI and control mice were fed a Western diet (TD88137, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI), in which 42% of the calories come from fat, for 11 weeks. Multianalyte Profile Testing—Fasted animals were bled either from the saphenous vein (live animals) or by heart puncture (CO2-asphyxiated terminal animals), and plasma was obtained and processed as described above under “Plasma Chemistries.” Frozen plasma was submitted to Rules-Based Medicine, Inc. (Austin, TX), for multianalyte profile analysis. Enzyme Replacement Therapy—Recombinant human α-l-iduronidase (Aldurazyme) expressed in and purified from Chinese hamster ovary cells was a kind gift of BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (Novato, CA). Four MPSI mice received a single injection of 10,000 units of α-l-iduronidase diluted in 300 μl of dilution buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 1 mm β-glycerophosphate) via their tail veins. Six control and four MPSI mice received sham injections of 300 μl of dilution buffer via their tail veins. All mice were killed 48 h post-injection by CO2 asphyxiation. Biochemistry—Portions of spleen from six sham-treated control mice, four sham-treated MPSI mice, or all four enzyme replacement-treated MPSI mice were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. The samples were homogenized in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2% Triton X-100 and assayed for the amount of total protein using the Coomassie dye binding assay (Bio-Rad). α-l-Iduronidase activity was determined using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl α-l-iduronide. The results are reported as specific activity (nanomoles of 4-methylumbelliferyl released per h/mg of total protein). Histopathology—Portions of spleen were individually immersed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in Spurr's resin. Sections of tissue (0.5 μm thick) were stained with toluidine blue and evaluated for lysosomal storage by light microscopy. Statistical Analysis—All data points presented are the means ± S.D. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined using Student's two-tailed t test assuming equal variance. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry demonstrated that all five mouse models of LSD analyzed had significantly (p < 0.05) decreased adiposity compared with normal control animals (Fig. 1A). Each model also had significantly (p < 0.05) less fat mass (data not shown). There were no morphological differences in adipocytes from MPSI mice and age- and sex-matched normal littermates upon examination by light microscopy (data not shown). Changes in lean mass varied between animal models. Two models (MPSVII and INCL) had significantly reduced lean mass; two models (MPSI and MPSIIIB) had significantly increased lean mass; and NPAB mice were not different from normal mice (data not shown). The reduced adiposity correlated with a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in circulating leptin levels in all models tested (Fig. 1B). MPSI and MPSIIIB mice had normal body weight, and MPSVII, NPAB, and INCL mice were significantly smaller than the normal control mice (Fig. 1C). Therefore, lysosomal storage and/or lysosomal dysfunction results in widespread failure of adipose tissue deposition regardless of the primary enzyme defect. Reduced adiposity due to dysfunctional or absent adipocytes can result in severe insulin resistance (13Reitman M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 459-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). MPSI mice had normal fasting plasma insulin levels (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, MPSI mice had normal responses to both glucose (Fig. 2B) and insulin tolerance tests (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it appears that MPSI mice suffer from depletion and/or a failure of triglyceride deposition in adipocytes and not dysfunctional adipocytes. Reduced adiposity could be due to reduced caloric intake or lipid malabsorption. Four of the models had significantly (p < 0.05) increased food intake, and MPSIIIB mice had normal food intake (Fig. 3). When challenged with olive oil gavage in the context of lipoprotein lipase inhibition with Triton WR-1339, MPSI and control animals had the same absorption and processing rate of triglycerides (Fig. 4A). If there is increased demand for energy elsewhere in the body causing depletion or if there is malabsorption of nutrients other than triglycerides, then providing a larger caloric intake via lipids should allow for triglyceride deposition in adipocytes. When fed a Western diet (42% calories from fat) for 11 weeks, MPSI and control mice had significantly (p < 0.05) higher adiposity compared with genetically matched mice fed standard chow (9% calories from fat) (Fig. 4B). Thus, the adipose deficiency appears to be caused by adipocyte-extrinsic factors.FIGURE 3LSD results in normal or increased food intake.

The levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and interleukin-6 were either unchanged or undetectable in all five models (supplemental Table 1). VCAM1 and MCP1 levels were increased in four of the five models (supplemental Fig. 8). MCP1 has known effects on adipocytes (14Sartipy P. Loskutoff D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7265-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 15Gerhardt C. Romero I. Cancello R. Camoin L. Strosberg A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, MCP1 deficiency in MPSI or NPAB mice failed to increase their adiposity (supplemental Fig. 9). Other chemokines were elevated in MPSI and MPSIIIB mice (supplemental Table 1) and might modulate adipocyte function. Therefore, we utilized chemokine-binding protein M3 transgenic mice to inhibit a wide variety of chemokines in MPSI and control mice. Chronic expression of M3 had no effect on MPSI adiposity (supplemental Figs. 10 and 11). Finally, chronic treatment with the steroid dexamethasone also failed to increase adiposity in MPSI mice (data not shown). Higher diversion or mobilization of lipids, normally destined for adipocyte deposition, could be due to a higher metabolic rate, storage of triglycerides elsewhere, and/or storage of material in a way that is inaccessible to the body. Closed circuit indirect calorimetry was used to measure the metabolic rate in all five models. MPSI, MPSVII, and INCL mice had a significantly (p < 0.05) reduced metabolic rate, whereas MPSIIIB and NPAB mice were indistinguishable from control animals (Fig. 5). All models had normal or reduced levels of plasma triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, glucose, and cholesterol (Table 1). In addition, triglyceride levels were significantly lower in the liver, and the trend was lower in the muscle of MPSI mice (Fig. 6). Therefore, if energy is being stored elsewhere in the body, it must be in a form other than triglycerides.TABLE 1Plasma chemistries All values are reported as a percentage of the normal ± S.D.

(2001) The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease, 8th Ed., pp. 3371-3894, McGraw-Hill Book Co., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Livers from MPSI mice weighed significantly (p < 0.05) more than control livers, yet had similar percent water (Table 2). Total liver caloric content, as determined by bomb calorimetry, was similar in both groups. However, MPSI livers had a lower caloric density (Table 2). This finding is indicative of a shift from a higher calorie-dense material (i.e. lipid) to a lower calorie-dense material (i.e. protein/carbohydrate), which explains some of the hepatomegaly. Thus, some of the energy that could be in the form of lipids is still present within the animal as protein/carbohydrate. These data are consistent with the nature of the primary storage material in MPSI mice (glycosaminoglycans, a complex polysaccharide). Thus, lysosomal storage would be an energy storage depot that is inaccessible to the cells and body. Enzyme replacement therapy should allow affected cells to access this depot. Forty-eight h after intravenous enzyme replacement therapy, the spleens of MPSI mice contained 150% normal enzyme levels and had a significant reduction in histologically demonstrable storage. It has been shown previously that the liver takes up more recombinant enzyme than the spleen and is nearly cleared of lysosomal storage by 48 h following a single injection of β-glucuronidase into the MPSVII mouse (17Sands M. Vogler C. Kyle J. Grubb J. Levy B. Galvin N. Sly W. Birkenmeier E. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 93: 2324-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). After 48 h, the hepatomegaly (excess mass) was reduced by 56% (p < 0.05) (Table 2) in the MPSI mice that received enzyme. However, the liver dry weight and total caloric content were not reduced, and the percent water remained similar to those in normal control mice. Following treatment, the caloric density (kilocalories/g) returned to normal (p < 0.993). These data are consistent with a reduction of glycosaminoglycan storage and an accumulation of lipid.TABLE 2Liver caloric values All values are reported as the mean ± S.D.

Previous studies of MPSVII and LAL mice had described a severe reduction in adipose tissue of unknown etiology (5Beamer W. Coleman D. Mouse Newsletter. 1982; 67: 21Google Scholar, 7Du H. Heur M. Duanmu M. Grabowski G. Hui D. Witte D. Mishra J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Du H. Duanmu M. Witte D. Grabowski G. Human Mol.

In the case of MPSVII mice, it was commonly believed that the adipose storage deficiency phenotype was due to a reduction in caloric intake caused by illness. Determining the cause of the adipose deficiency associated with LAL deficiency is complicated by the very fact that triglycerides and cholesterol esters are the primary storage material. In this study, we have shown that lysosomal storage and/or lysosomal dysfunction results in widespread failure of adipose tissue deposition regardless of the primary enzyme defect. The adipose deficit is not the result of reduced caloric intake or increased metabolic rate (all models) or lipid malabsorption (in the case of MPSI mice). In addition, the insulin sensitivity of the MPSI mice suggests normal adipocyte function. This conclusion is substantiated by the increased adiposity of MPSI mice upon Western diet challenge. Our data do not discriminate decreased lipid deposition in adipocytes from increased mobilization. Although MCP1 has been shown to inhibit adipocyte differentiation in vitro (14Sartipy P. Loskutoff D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7265-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 15Gerhardt C. Romero I. Cancello R. Camoin L. Strosberg A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), elevated pro-inflammatory proteins do not appear to play a major role in modulating the abnormal adiposity observed in this study. Circulating non-esterified fatty acid was normal or lower in all animal models, suggesting that the adipose deficiency is not the result of increased mobilization. However, it is possible that an increase in tissue utilization is keeping pace with or outpacing increased mobilization. Induced expression of lipoprotein lipase as measured by microarray analysis in the livers of MPSI, MPSIIIB, and MPSVII mice is suggestive of an increased tissue demand for lipids (data not shown). In the case of MPSI mice, the possible increased tissue demand for lipids did not correlate with an increase in triglyceride levels in those tissues. Both MPSI and MPSIIIB mice had normal body weights, suggesting a shift in mass from fat to other tissues. Furthermore, MPSIIIB mice had normal metabolic parameters except for an increase in lean tissue mass. With regard to mass balance, this would suggest that some of the energy normally found as fat stores is still present in the animals in a form other than triglycerides. This idea is supported by the observation of a shift in energy from lipids to proteins/carbohydrates in the livers of MPSI mice. The normalization of the liver caloric density 48 h after enzyme replacement in MPSI mice suggests that the increased proteins/carbohydrates are the stored glycosaminoglycans, a complex polysaccharide. Therefore, lysosomal storage is an energy storage depot that is inaccessible to the cells and body. A major function of the lysosome is to recycle macromolecules presumably to reduce the demand for the energy intensive de novo synthesis of raw materials. Furthermore, more of the energy budget of the cell is being diverted to both the management of lysosomal storage (increased protein and membrane synthesis) and the production of the raw material no longer available through recycling (Fig. 7). Enzyme replacement therapy allows affected cells to access this energy depot and reduces the metabolic shifts in energy use. As the glycosaminoglycans are catabolized to monosaccharides and transported to the cytosol, the cell will no longer need to devote as much energy to their de novo synthesis, especially during the initial surge. We hypothesize that this will allow traditional cellular energy stores to accumulate to normal levels. Our enzyme replacement experiment supports this view. For example, 48 h after a single treatment, the total liver caloric content was similar to that in untreated mice; however, the energy density (kilocalories/g) was higher and indistinguishable from that in control mice. Thus, there is a higher level of lipid present in the liver. The rapid increase in the lipid fraction could be due to conversion of storage material (glycosaminoglycans and/or membrane) to lipids, reduced catabolism of lipids, and/or an increased influx of lipid. Thus, in conjunction with the normal/reduced metabolic rate, these data suggest that there is increased energy use for anabolic processes. The ability to deposit triglycerides in adipose tissue is due to having a positive energy balance. Because of its inaccessible nature, lysosomal storage does not contribute to metabolism except as an energy sink. Early in the disease process, the percentage of energy devoted to managing lysosomal storage is small. Animals with a LSD could have a positive energy balance, albeit reduced compared normal animals because of the increased de novo synthesis of raw material no longer being recycled. However, over time, the percentage of available energy devoted to managing lysosomal storage will continue to increase. In response, it is likely that the body would further compensate as if it were suffering from malabsorption or reduced caloric ingestion by increasing food intake and/or decreasing its metabolic rate. Another response could be to increase the rate of autophagy in severely affected cells, further exacerbating the problem by sequestering yet more material in the lysosome in a feedback mechanism. In fact, an increase in autophagy has been reported recently in a mouse model of the LSD juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (18Cao Y. Espinola J.A. Fossale E. Massey A.C. Cervo A.M.

This relentless diversion of an increasing percentage of available nutrients to managing lysosomal storage will eventually be beyond the body's ability to adapt. At some point, the energy available for normal cellular functions will be below the necessary level to sustain life. In conclusion, this mechanism suggests that decreased adiposity will be a universal feature of LSD. Furthermore, if storage of material that is inaccessible to the body inevitably leads to a reduction in adiposity, then potentially any disorder with significant accumulation of irretrievable material might exhibit reduced adiposity. If true, this could represent a new form of fat loss, one whose energy is retained in an inaccessible form or compartment in the body. These findings add potentially an entire class of disorders (>40 LSDs) (1Vellodi A. Br. J. Haematol. 2005; 128: 413-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) to the number of lean mouse models (13Reitman M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 459-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) available for study. In addition, these data demonstrate the importance of lysosomal recycling for the efficient utilization of energy. Finally, the mechanism described here would on its own eventually prove lethal. More important, however, increased nutrient-rich calorie consumption might delay the complications associated with lysosomal storage, including its lethality.

To determine whether these KSPGs have a role in corneal inflammation, we examined Kera–/– and Lum–/– mice in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced keratitis in which wild-type mice develop increased corneal thickness and haze due to neutrophil infiltration to the corneal stroma. Corneal thickness increases caused by LPS mice were significantly lower in Kera–/– and Lum–/– than wild-type mice. Further, LPS-injected Lum–/– mice had elevated corneal haze levels compared with that of Kera–/– and wild-type. At 24 h post-injection, total enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells in chimeric mice was significantly lower in Kera–/– mice and Lum–/– mice compared with wild-type mice. Neutrophil infiltration was inhibited in Kera–/– and Lum–/– mice at 6 and 24 h post-stimulation, with Lum–/– corneas having the most profound defect in neutrophil migration. Reconstitution of keratocan and lumican expression in corneas of Kera–/– and Lum–/– mice using adeno-keratocan and adeno-lumican viral vectors, respectively, resulted in normal neutrophil infiltration in response to LPS. Immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis showed that lumican and keratocan core proteins bind the CXC chemokine KC during a corneal inflammatory response, indicating that corneal KSPGs mediate neutrophil recruitment to the cornea by regulating chemokine gradient formation. Together, these data support a significant role for lumican and keratocan in a corneal inflammatory response with respect to edema, corneal clarity, and cellular infiltration.

Together, these data support a significant role for lumican and keratocan in a corneal inflammatory response with respect to edema, corneal clarity, and cellular infiltration. Corneal transparency is dependent on a tightly regulated, dynamic series of events, and disruption of normal homeostatic regulatory processes can result in loss of corneal clarity, visual impairment, and in severe instances corneal opacification and blindness. One critical requirement for corneal clarity is maintenance of the highly organized matrix of collagen fibrils. This organization of collagen fibrils with respect to fibril diameter and interfibrillar spacing is regulated largely by lumican and keratocan, which are part of the small leucine-rich keratan-sulfate proteoglycan (KSPG) 2The abbreviations used are: KSPG, keratan-sulfate proteoglycan; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IP, immunoprecipitation; hKera, human keratocan; hLum, human lumican; KC, keratinocyte-derived chemokine; ELR, glycine-leucine-arginine motif. 2The abbreviations used are: KSPG, keratan-sulfate proteoglycan; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IP, immunoprecipitation; hKera, human keratocan; hLum, human lumican; KC, keratinocyte-derived chemokine; ELR, glycine-leucine-arginine motif. family (1Carlson E.C.

Keratocan expression is limited to the corneal stroma in adult mice, whereas lumican is also expressed in skin, sclera, and aorta (4Ying S. Shiraishi A. Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Funderburgh J.L.

The role of KSPGs in maintaining corneal clarity has been shown in keratocan-null mice (Kera–/–), which have an overall thinner corneal stroma and a narrower cornea-iris angle as compared with wild-type littermates (3Liu C.Y. Birk D.E. Hassell J.R. Kane B. Kao W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21672-21677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast, corneas of lumican-null mice (Lum–/–) are also thinner but also have corneal opacity (6Chakravarti S. Magnuson T. Lass J.H. Jepsen K.J. LaMantia C. Carroll H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1277-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Corneal inflammation caused by active microbial infection or by microbial products leads to decreased visual acuity, primarily as a result of inflammatory cell infiltration. Neutrophils are the predominant infiltrating cells, and their degranulation and release of cytotoxic mediators can disrupt normal corneal function (7Oshima T. Sonoda K.H. Tsutsumi-Miyahara C. Qiao H.

Several reports show that neutrophil recruitment is mediated by CXC chemokines produced by resident corneal cells, which have an important role in neutrophil recruitment to the corneal stroma (10Carlson E.C.

Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 81: 786Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); however very little is known about the role of extracellular matrix proteins, including KSPGs in neutrophil infiltration. In the current study, we used gene knock-out mice to examine the role of lumican and keratocan in regulating neutrophil recruitment and loss of corneal clarity. Our results demonstrate that KSPGs have a critical role in the corneal inflammatory response. Furthermore, we identify a novel role for corneal proteoglycans during an inflammatory response by showing that keratocan and lumican bind CXCL1/KC. Animals—C57BL/6-TgN(ACTbEGFP)1Osb (The Jackson Laboratory), B6/129, Kera–/–, and Lum–/– mice (26Saika S. Shiraishi A. Liu C.Y. Funderburgh J.L. Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Kao W.W. J. Biol.

Animal care and use conformed to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Resolution on the Use of Animals in Research. The Institutional Care and Use Committee of Case Western Reserve University approved all animal protocols. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injections of ketamine (2.0 mg) and xylazine (0.4 mg). One drop of Alcaine® 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution (Alconlabs, Fort Worth, TX) was applied to each eye prior to surgery as a topical anesthetic. Generation of EGFP Chimeric Mice—C57BL/6 recipient mice received a total of 1,200 rads (12 grays) whole body irradiation delivered in two doses of 600 rads (6 grays) 3 h apart as previously described (10Carlson E.C. Drazba J. Yang X. Perez V.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Kozu T. Sueoka E. Okabe S. Sueoka N. Komori A. Fujiki H.

Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) chimeric mice were used 2 weeks after the bone marrow transplant to allow for bone marrow reconstitution (15Auletta J.J. Devecchio J.L. Ferrara J.L. Heinzel F.P. Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant. 2004; 10: 834-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Induction of LPS Keratitis—Intrastromal injection of 1 μg (EGFP chimeric experiments) or 500 ng of ultrapure Escherichia coli LPS (Invivogen) in 2–3 μl of PBS (Sigma) or PBS only was performed in sedated animals as previously described (16Carlson E.C.

Briefly, a small tunnel from the corneal epithelium to central stroma was created using a 33-gauge needle (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV). Another 33-gauge needle attached to a 10-μl Hamilton syringe was passed through the tunnel into the central cornea where the contents of the syringe were injected. Adenoviral in Vivo Transfection—The mice were subjected to intrastromal injection of adenoviral vectors (Ad-Lum, Ad-Kera, and Ad-EGFP) as described previously (16Carlson E.C. Liu C.Y. Yang X. Gregory M. Ksander B. Drazba J. Perez V.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 2194-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and observed during a recovery period until awakening in a heated chamber. Expression was confirmed by visualizing EGFP-positive cells 18 h following the introduction of the adenoviral constructs to the corneal stroma. Fluorescent stereomicrograph EGFP intensity was quantitated using Image Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Construction of Recombinant Adenoviruses—The human keratocan (hKera) and lumican (hLum) full-length coding regions were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using total RNA isolated from human cornea (Cincinnati Eye Bank). The PCR primers for hKera were: hKera > 5′, gatcgcggccgctata atggcaggcacaatctgtttc, and hKera > 3′, gatcgcggccgcgtttaaataatgacagcctgcagaa, and for hLum were Lum > 5′, gatcgcggccgcaaaatgagtctaagtgcatttactc, and Lum > 3′, gatcgcggccgcgat attaattaagagtgacttcgtt. The resulting PCR products were then subcloned into the NotI site of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, Inc.). Both hKera and hLum cDNA in the constructed plasmid were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The hKera and hLum fragments were then excised from pcDNA3.1-hKera and pcDNA3.1-hLum plasmid, respectively, with NotI and inserted into the pAdTrack-CMV pAdTrack-CMV to yield an adenoviral shuttle plasmids. Recombinant adenoviral plasmids were generated by homologous recombination in E. coli, as described previously (18Chen J. Huber B.T. Grand R.J. Li W. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1297-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purified viruses were aliquoted in 50% glycerol and stored at –20 °C. The viral titer (plaque-forming unit per ml) for adenovirus preparation was determined in 293 cells using 96-well plates and series-diluted virus for transfection. After 7 days, green fluorescent protein expression was examined under an inverted fluorescence microscope to calibrate the viral titer. In Vivo Imaging—Imaging of EGFP-positive inflammatory cell migration into the cornea was performed using a Leica MZFLIII high resolution stereo fluorescence microscope with a vertical fluorescence illuminator (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL). Sedated EGFP chimeric mice were immobilized using a custom-built three-point stereotactic mouse restrainer, and images were captured at different time points using a SpotCam RT KE digital camera (Sterling Heights, MI). Images were obtained at 32× magnification using a standardized exposure time. EGFP-positive cells were quantitated using Image Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics Inc., Carlsbad, CA). Immunohistochemical Staining of Cornea Frozen Sections—Eyes were enucleated 24 h after intrastromal injection, snap frozen, and embedded in Tissue-Tek® OCT compound (Miles Scientific, Naperville, IL). 5-μm frozen sections of the central cornea were air dried for 30 min, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, and washed with PBS, and neutrophils and macrophages were stained with anti-NIMP-R14 (Serotec, Oxford, UK) and anti-F4/80 (Serotec), respectively. NIMP-R14 recognizes a currently undetermined structure on the neutrophil plasma membrane and has been successfully used to identify neutrophils in murine corneas (19Khatri S. Lass J.H. Heinzel F.P. Petroll W.M. Gomez J. Diaconu E. Kalsow C.M. Pearlman E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 2278-2284PubMed Google Scholar). Examination of Stromal Thickness and Haze—In vivo analysis of cellular infiltration was accomplished by in vivo confocal microscopy (Confoscan3; Nidek Technologies America, New Orleans, LA) as described (20Johnson A.C. Heinzel F.P. Diaconu E. Sun Y. Hise A.G. Golenbock D. Lass J.H. Pearlman E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized and immobilized on a secure platform. A ×40 objective was maneuvered into place on the corneal surface by using transparent gel (Genteal; Novartis Ophthalmics, Duluth, GA) as a medium between the corneal surface and the objective, and the software (NAVIS; Lucent Technologies, Murray Hill, NJ) captured images every 1.3 μm and stored them as a stack for analysis of corneal thickness and haze. Stromal thickness was defined as the area between basal epithelium and corneal endothelium, and stromal haze was defined as stromal thickness × combined light intensity of each image of the corneal stroma. To obtain this, the series of intensity values for each corneal stroma was used to generate and calculate the total area under the curve (Prism; Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA). Base-line measurements were determined from PBS-injected mouse corneas. Immunoprecipitation/Western Blot Analysis—Corneas were excised 24 h after intrastromal injection of 500 ng of LPS and homogenized using a TissueLyser in IP buffer (Protein G Immunoprecipitation kit; Sigma-Aldrich). Following homogenization, individual corneas were aliquoted and either 5 μgof rat anti-KC or rat IgG2a antibodies (R&D Systems Inc. Minneapolis, MN) were added to the aliquots, placed in the supplied tubes from the Sigma Protein G Immunoprecipitation kit, and incubated for 5 h at 4 °C. Following this incubation, Protein G was added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The column was centrifuged (12,000 × g), washed two times with 0.1% SDS and 0.5 m NaCl in 1× IP buffer, and washed four more times with 1× IP buffer. The final wash was performed with 0.1× IP buffer. Samples were eluted with 2× Laemelli buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were loaded equally for each cornea and run on a 12.5 or 10% Fluorescent Sprint Gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked with 5% cold water fish gelatin (AMRESCO, Solon, OH). Western blots for lumican and keratocan were performed as previously described (21Carlson E.C. Liu C.Y. Chikama T. Hayashi Y. Kao C.W. Birk D.E. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Kao W.W. J. Biol.

Naïve Lum–/– mice have significantly greater corneal opacity and overall thinner corneas when compared with naïve wild-type corneas whereas Kera–/– mice exhibit a thin but transparent corneal phenotype (3Liu C.Y. Birk D.E. Hassell J.R. Kane B. Kao W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21672-21677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To determine the role of lumican and keratocan in LPS keratitis, we measured corneal thickness and haze in KSPG-null mouse corneas (n = 4). PBS or LPS was injected into the corneal stroma of Lum–/–, Kera–/–, and wild-type littermate controls, and in vivo confocal microscopy (Confoscan™) was used to measure stromal thickness 24 h following intrastromal injection. As shown in Fig. 1A, PBS-injected corneas showed a significant difference in thickness between the groups, with Lum–/– < Kera–/– < control mice and following LPS injection (Fig. 1B), Kera–/– and Lum–/– corneal thickness remained less than wild-type corneas. For corneal haze, PBS-injected Lum–/– mouse corneas were significantly higher than Kera–/– and wild-type corneas (Fig. 1C). However, LPS-injected Lum–/– corneas had elevated haze compared with wild-type and Kera–/– (Fig. 1D), suggesting that the absence of lumican and the decreased expression of keratocan in the corneal stroma of Lum–/– mice results in a collagen matrix more susceptible to edema. Increased edema in the corneal stroma results in a more disorganized collagen matrix leading to increased corneal haze. The lack of uniformity in collagen fibril diameter inherent to Lum–/– mice and increased interfibrillar spacing also contributes to elevated haze in these mice. Together, these data show that keratocan is important in the regulation of cornea stromal thickness but has little impact on corneal transparency. However, our findings demonstrate that lumican is a critical component in development of LPS-induced increased stromal thickness and loss of corneal transparency. Bone Marrow-derived Inflammatory Cell Infiltration Is Inhibited in Kera–/– and Lum–/– Corneas during LPS-induced Keratitis—To examine the role of keratocan and lumican on cellular infiltration, Kera–/– and Lum–/– mice were lethally irradiated (12 grays) and reconstituted with EGFP-positive bone marrow cells extracted from the C57BL/6-TgN (ACTbEGFP) mouse, as previously reported (10Carlson E.C. Drazba J. Yang X. Perez V.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Following bone marrow reconstitution (2 weeks), Kera–/– and Lum–/– × EGFP chimeric mice were injected intrastromally with 2 μgof LPS. In vivo fluorescent stereomicroscope images were taken at 24 h (Fig. 2A) post-LPS injection to determine the kinetics of bone marrow-derived inflammatory cell infiltration into these corneas. The representative images (n = 3) show EGFP-positive bone marrow-derived inflammatory cells present in wild-type, Kera–/–, and Lum–/– chimeric mouse corneas 24 h after injection of LPS into the corneal stroma. The total number of EGFP+ bone marrow-derived cells present in the corneas (paracentral to central) 24 h following intrastromal injection were measured using ImagePro+ software. Fig. 2B shows that, as in our previous study, wild-type chimeric mice injected with 2 μg of LPS developed a pronounced cellular infiltrate (2Chakravarti S. Petroll W.M. Hassell J.R. Jester J.V. Lass J.H. Paul J. Birk D.E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3365-3373PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, these mice had EGFP+ cells (1,058 ± 38) in the cornea. In contrast, EGFP+ cells in Kera–/– (616 ± 139) and Lum–/– (327 ± 55) were significantly reduced. There was no significant difference between Kera–/– and Lum–/– corneas. Taken together, these data indicate that bone marrow cell infiltration to the corneal stroma is dependent on both lumican and keratocan. Keratocan and Lumican Are Essential for Neutrophil Infiltration to the Corneal Stroma—Our previous studies using this model showed that the neutrophil infiltrate peaked at 24 h after LPS injection (10Carlson E.C. Drazba J. Yang X. Perez V.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine the role of these KSPGs on neutrophil infiltration, LPS keratitis was induced by injecting LPS into the corneal stroma of wild-type, Lum–/–, and Kera–/– mice (n = 5). After 6 and 24 h, eyes were enucleated, and 5-μm sections were immunostained using the neutrophil marker NIMP-R14. As shown in Fig. 3, Kera–/– and Lum–/– corneas had significantly fewer neutrophils in the corneal stroma at 6 and 24 h. Furthermore, Lum–/– corneas had significantly fewer neutrophils than the Kera–/– corneas. These data show that keratocan and lumican regulate neutrophil infiltration through the cornea stroma. ELR+ CXC Chemokine Production Is Not Reduced in Kera–/– and Lum–/– Corneas—One possible mechanism underlying the impaired ability of neutrophils to infiltrate Kera–/– and Lum–/– corneas is decreased ELR+ CXC chemokine expression. ELR+ CXC chemokines mediate neutrophil recruitment to the cornea during an LPS-induced inflammatory response (12Lin M. Carlson E. Diaconu E. Pearlman E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 81: 786Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Carlson E.C. Liu C.Y. Chikama T. Hayashi Y. Kao C.W. Birk D.E. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Kao W.W. J. Biol.

Kera–/–, Lum–/–, and wild-type mice (n = 5) were injected with LPS as before, and after 6 h corneas were dissected and homogenized, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure KC/CXCL1 and MIP-2/CXCL2 levels. As shown in Fig. 4, KC and MIP-2 were produced by all three strains, and there was no significant difference among any of the groups. This finding indicates that impaired neutrophil infiltration is not due to differences in ELR+ CXC chemokine production. Rescue of KSPG-null Phenotype Using Adenoviral Constructs—We previously demonstrated that adenoviral vectors are expressed in the corneal stroma for up to 21 days after injection (16Carlson E.C. Liu C.Y. Yang X. Gregory M. Ksander B. Drazba J. Perez V.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 2194-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine whether adenovirus expressing keratocan or lumican can rescue the phenotype of these mice after LPS injection, adenovirus constitutively expressing hLumican, hKeratocan, and EGFP under the cytomegalovirus promoter was intrastromally injected into the corneal stroma of KSPG-null mice 18 h prior to LPS (500 ng) intrastromal injection. Adenoviral-delivered transgene expression in wild-type mice was confirmed by EGFP standardized expression between the ad-hLum and ad-hKera constructs as shown in Fig. 5A. Transgene expression was confirmed by visualizing EGFP expression under a fluorescent stereomicroscope (Fig. 5B). The kinetics of ad-EGFP empty vector expression was described previously (16Carlson E.C. Liu C.Y. Yang X. Gregory M. Ksander B. Drazba J. Perez V.L. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2004; 45: 2194-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 6 and 24 h following LPS injection, 5-μm corneal sections were immunostained for NIMP-R14, as before. Fig. 5C shows that at 6 h following LPS injection, adeno-hKera-injected corneas (n = 3) had a 3.6-fold increase (p = 0.031) of neutrophils in the cornea as compared with control adeno-EGFP corneas in Kera–/– mice (Fig. 5A). Similarly, Lum–/– corneas (n = 3) injected with adeno-hLum constructs had a 3.2-fold increase (p = 0.047) of neutrophils as compared with the adeno-EGFP-injected corneas (Fig. 5D). At 24 h following LPS injection, Kera–/– corneas (n = 5) receiving adeno-hkera had a significantly greater number of neutrophils (p = 0.028) compared with control adeno-EGFP constructs (Fig. 5E). Lum–/– corneas (n = 5) injected with adeno-hLum prior to LPS stimulation had a significantly greater number of neutrophils present in the cornea (p < 0.0001) after 24 h (Fig. 5F). Therefore, the ability of neutrophils to migrate into the Kera–/– (Fig. 5, C and E) and Lum–/– (Fig. 5, D and F) mice was restored in mice receiving the corresponding adenoviral construct as compared with the empty vector control groups (Ad-EGFP). These differences were due to LPS-induced inflammation rather than intrinsic effects (or contaminants) relating to the adenoviral injections, as neutrophils were not recruited to naïve corneas or corneas injected with PBS (not shown). KC Forms a Complex with Keratocan and Lumican Core Protein during an Inflammatory Response—Previous studies showed that CXCL1/KC mediates neutrophil recruitment in LPS-injected corneas (12Lin M. Carlson E. Diaconu E. Pearlman E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 81: 786Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and others showed that CXCL1/KC binds to the proteoglycan syndecan 1 (22Li Q. Park P.W. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Cell. 2002; 111: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether a similar mechanism is involved in Kera–/– and Lum–/– mice, we determined whether KC is able to bind keratocan and/or lumican during LPS keratitis. To examine this possibility, corneas were injected with 500 ng of LPS, and corneal extracts were prepared by homogenizing in 1× IP buffer and incubated with anti-KC. KC was immunoprecipitated from the corneal extracts (n = 4) using rat anti-KC. Normal rat IgG2a served as a control and was incubated with an equal aliquot of the corneal extracts. Following high stringency washing (5 m NaCl and 0.1% SDS), the samples were eluted, run on a 12.5% Fluorescent Sprint gel (AMRESCO), and Western blots for keratocan and lumican were performed. Fig. 6 shows the presence of keratocan core protein (Fig. 6A, top panel) in the samples immunoprecipitated with anti-KC, whereas no signal was detected in the Rat IgG2a control samples. Similarly, the presence of lumican core protein is detected in the samples immunoprecipitated with anti-KC (bottom panel). To determine whether lumican and keratocan core protein or their keratan-sulfate side chains were responsible for binding KC, corneas were injected with LPS and 24 h later corneal extracts were prepared and equally aliquoted. One aliquot was digested with keratanase to remove all keratan sulfation prior to washing and eluting the immunoprecipitates, while the other aliquot remained undigested. Samples were then run on a 10% Fluorescent Sprint gel (AMRESCO), and Western blot for keratocan (Fig. 6B, top panel) or lumican (bottom panel) was performed. This demonstrates identical size proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-KC in both the keratanase-digested and undigested samples. No higher molecular weight bands indicative of glycosylation were detected in the untreated samples. This finding indicates that the binding of KC is to the core protein and not to the keratin-sulfate chains. These results demonstrate that KC specifically binds keratocan and lumican core protein during an LPS-induced inflammatory response in the cornea and demonstrate an important role for these KSPGs in neutrophil infiltration to the corneal stroma. The results presented in this study demonstrate a significant role for corneal proteoglycans in the process of neutrophil infiltration during an innate immune response. The use of Lum–/– and Kera–/– mice demonstrates the role of these KSPGs in regulating neutrophils to infiltrate the corneal stroma, especially in Lum–/– corneas. Bone marrow stromal cells express lumican (23Liu Y. Cooper P.R. Barralet J.E. Shelton R.M. Biomaterials. 2007; 28: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting that these cells could contribute to the observed phenotype. However, Lum–/– and Kera–/– mice reconstituted with wild-type bone marrow cells had impaired responses to LPS compared with wild-type recipients, indicating that the inhibition of neutrophil infiltration is the direct result of alteration of the extracellular matrix in the cornea. The restoration of lumican and keratocan expression in corneas using in vivo adenoviral infection conferred a wild-type phenotype to Lum–/– and Kera–/– mice, thereby supporting the bone marrow chimera results in showing that KSPG expression in the keratocytes, rather than bone marrow-derived cells, is the essential mediator of inflammation. Also, as is evident in other data presented in this study, the impact of lumican was notably greater than its KSPG family member keratocan. Taking these findings together, it is clear that the keratan-sulfate proteoglycans play a critical role in the inflammatory response and that these KSPG regulate inflammation by the specific binding of KC to keratocan and lumican. This direct interaction implicates both a novel and an important role for keratan-sulfate proteoglycans in the inflammatory response. KC also binds syndecan-1, a cell-bound heparan-sulfate proteoglycan, in a model of acute lung injury. The underlying mechanism was hypothesized to be that the interaction is necessary for formation of a chemokine gradient responsible for bringing neutrophils from the interstitium to the alveolar space. When bound, KC is unable to diffuse through the matrix to form a chemotactic gradient for neutrophil influx. However, matrilysin cleaves syndecan from the cell surface, which releases the syndecan-1/KC complex, allowing for the formation of a chemokine gradient. This gradient then allows neutrophils to be recruited to the site of inflammation (22Li Q. Park P.W. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Cell. 2002; 111: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). We propose a similar mechanism in the cornea to bring neutrophils from the limbal vessels into the corneal stroma. Lumican is reported to regulate gene expression (21Carlson E.C. Liu C.Y. Chikama T. Hayashi Y. Kao C.W. Birk D.E. Funderburgh J.L. Jester J.V. Kao W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25541-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), cell proliferation (24Ping Lu Y. Ishiwata T. Asano G. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), cell migration, cell adhesion (25Funderburgh J.L. Mitschler R.R. Funderburgh M.L. Roth M.R. Chapes S.K. Conrad G.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1159-1167PubMed Google Scholar), and wound healing (26Saika S. Shiraishi A. Liu C.Y. Funderburgh J.L. Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Kao W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2607-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Following a corneal epithelial debridement injury, lumican-null mice have delayed epithelial wound healing that is attributed to impaired cell migration and proliferation (26Saika S. Shiraishi A. Liu C.Y. Funderburgh J.L. Kao C.W. Converse R.L. Kao W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2607-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Moreover, lumican is capable of regulating keratocan gene expression through transcriptional regulation in the corneal stroma. Keratocan expression is significantly decreased in lumican-null mice, whereas lumican expression is unchanged in keratocan-null mice (27Carlson E.C. Wang I.J. Liu C.Y. Brannan P. Kao C.W. Kao W.W. Mol. Vis. 2003; 9: 615-623PubMed Google Scholar). Kera–/– mice express lumican at normal levels in the cornea, but Lum–/– mice have a significant reduction in keratocan expression. Furthermore, reporter gene expression driven by the keratocan promoter when co-expressed with lumican resulted in a 2-fold increase in activity. This not only demonstrates the ability of lumican to regulate gene expression at the transcriptional level but also provides insight as to why Lum–/– mice have a more pronounced phenotype than Kera–/– mice with respect to decreased corneal clarity, thinner corneal stroma, and a significantly greater impairment of neutrophil infiltration. The impaired recruitment of neutrophils in Lum–/– corneas during an inflammatory response due to epithelial injury and topical exposure to LPS was previously reported as being dependent upon impaired expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 1β, and interleukin 6 (28Vij N. Roberts L. Joyce S. Chakravarti S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2005; 46: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This same group recently reported that Lum–/– are hyporesponsive to LPS-induced septic shock and the systemic administration of LPS also resulted in decreased serum levels of the same pro-inflammatory cytokines (29Wu F. Vij N. Roberts L. Lopez-Briones S. Joyce S. Chakravarti S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26409-26417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We also found a similar finding in Lum–/– mice with respect to decreased neutrophil infiltration but report a different mechanism for Lum–/– and Kera–/– corneas. CXC chemokines also mediate neutrophil recruitment to the cornea during an LPS-induced inflammatory response, specifically the ELR+ CXC chemokines (LIX, KC, MIP-2) (12Lin M. Carlson E. Diaconu E. Pearlman E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 81: 786Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). CXC chemokines are expressed by resident macrophages and corneal fibroblasts in response to LPS stimulation (12Lin M. Carlson E. Diaconu E. Pearlman E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2006; 81: 786Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Here, we report no difference in ELR+ CXC chemokine expression in Lum–/– mice, suggesting there is no reduction in the expression of chemokines responsible for corneal neutrophil infiltrates. We have demonstrated that levels of these chemokines in the Lum–/– and Kera–/– corneas are not significantly different from wild-type corneas, implying that Lum–/– and Kera–/– mice effectively produce the factors necessary to elicit an innate immune response to recruit neutrophils to the cornea. Moreover, neutrophils extravasate from the limbal vessels and migrate into the cornea in the proteoglycan-null corneas, albeit at a reduced level. Because the levels of the chemokines responsible for corneal infiltration of neutrophils are not suppressed, it is possible these chemokines are not active. The ability of proteoglycans to bind chemokines rendering the chemokine inactive has been documented in instances of hepatitis and acute lung inflammation. It has been suggested that in these models the proteoglycan binds the chemokine, rendering it inactive until the proteoglycan is cleaved, thereby releasing the complex. The release of this complex allows the chemokine to become active and establish the chemokine gradient necessary for recruitment of neutrophils to the site of inflammation (22Li Q. Park P.W. Wilson C.L. Parks W.C. Cell. 2002; 111: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 30Gueders M.M. Balbin M. Rocks N. Foidart J.M. Gosset P. Louis R. Shapiro S. Lopez-Otin C. Noel A. Cataldo D.D. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2589-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the current study, we found that KC binds lumican and keratocan, supporting the notion of a similar pathway in the cornea. This interaction suggests a potential function for keratocan and lumican in the cornea, i.e., to sequester and release chemokines in the extracellular matrix necessary for neutrophil infiltration. The data presented here, taken together with previous reports, demonstrate that keratan-sulfate proteoglycans in the cornea have the potential to create a chemokine gradient necessary for neutrophil influx during a Gram-negative bacterial infection. Lum–/– and Kera–/– mice have an impaired ability to recruit neutrophils to the cornea in response to the bacterial endotoxin LPS. Identification of the factors responsible for the mobilization of this CXC chemokine/proteoglycan complex to form a gradient are currently underway to identify the mechanism whereby proteoglycans regulate the infiltration of neutrophils into the corneal stroma.

https://openalex.org/W2018799668,"The Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 gene (EWSR1), also known as EWS, is fused to a number of different partner genes as a result of chromosomal translocation in diverse sarcomas. Despite the involvement of EWSR1 in these diverse sarcomas, the in vivo function of wild type EWSR1 remains unclear.We identified two zebrafish EWSR1 orthologues, ewsr1a and ewsr1b, and demonstrate that both genes are expressed maternally, and are expressed ubiquitously throughout zebrafish embryonic development. Morpholino induced knockdown of both zebrafish ewsr1 genes led to mitotic defects with multipolar or otherwise abnormal mitotic spindles starting from the bud stage (10 hour post-fertilization (hpf)). The abnormalities in mitotic spindles were followed by p53-mediated apoptosis in the developing central nervous system (CNS) leading to a reduction in the number of proneural cells, disorganization of neuronal networks, and embryonic lethality by 5 days post-fertilization. siRNA silencing of EWSR1 in Hela cells resulted in mitotic defects accompanied by apoptotic cell death, indicating that the role of EWSR1 is conserved between zebrafish and human.Ewsr1 maintains mitotic integrity and proneural cell survival in early zebrafish development."
https://openalex.org/W2106696077,"The human proteome is rich with protein kinases, and this richness has made the kinase of crucial importance in initiating and maintaining cell behavior. Elucidating cell signaling networks and manipulating their components to understand and alter behavior require well designed inhibitors. These inhibitors are needed in culture to cause and study network perturbations, and the same compounds can be used as drugs to treat disease. Understanding the structural biology of protein kinases in detail, including their commonalities, differences and modes of substrate interaction, is necessary for designing high quality inhibitors that will be of true use for cell biology and disease therapy. To this end, we here report on a structural analysis of all available active-conformation protein kinases, discussing residue conservation, the novel features of such conservation, unique properties of atypical kinases and variability in the context of substrate binding. We also demonstrate how this information can be used for structure prediction. Our findings will be of use not only in understanding protein kinase function and evolution, but they highlight the flaws inherent in kinase drug design as commonly practiced and dictate an appropriate strategy for the sophisticated design of specific inhibitors for use in the laboratory and disease therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2036413220,"During apoptosis, the pro-apoptotic protein Bax relocalizes from the cytosol to the mitochondrial outer membrane. This relocalization is associated to major conformational changes, namely at the N- and C-terminal ends of the protein. Substitution of residues located at critical positions within the protein potentially stimulates or inhibits this process. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that phosphorylation of serine residues might trigger these conformational changes, with a focus on Ser163 and Ser184, which have been shown to be phosphorylatable by protein kinases GSK3β and Akt/PKB, respectively, and on Ser60, which is located in a consensus target sequence for PKA. Substitutions of these serine residues by alanine or aspartate were done in wild type or previously characterized Bax mutants, and the capacity of the resulting proteins to interact with mitochondria and to release cytochrome c was assayed in yeast, which provides a tool to study the function of Bax, independently of the rest of the apoptotic network. We conclude that sequential phosphorylation of these serine residues might participate in the triggering of the different conformational changes associated with Bax activation during apoptosis.

The crucial function of Bcl-2 family proteins in the regulation of apoptosis is now well established (1Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, membrane multidomain proteins Bax and Bak are essential for the completion of apoptosis because their double knock-out fully impairs this process (2Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H.

Their main function is the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to the relocalization of apoptogenic factors, such as cytochrome c, smac/diablo, omi/HtrA2, endonuclease G, and apoptosis-inducing factor (3Martinou J.-C.

Bax may also participate in the opening of the permeability transition pore, leading to the rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane and to the release of bigger proteins such as apoptosis-inducing factor (13Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M. Susin S.A. Vieira H.L. Prevost M.C. Xie Z. Matsuyama S. Reed J.C. Kroemer G.

The cascade of events driving the conversion of inactive, cytosolic Bax to mitochondrial, active Bax requires further clarification. It has been suggested that the N-terminal end of Bax controls its localization (16Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J.

Vallette F.M. Manon S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Increasing the mobility of this N-terminal end, termed ART (apoptosis regulation of targeting) had a similar stimulating effect both in mammalian and yeast cells (19Cartron P.-F. Moreau C. Oliver L.

The main consequence of ART movement is thought to be the exposure of the α1 helix, which can behave as a mitochondria-addressing sequence (17Cartron P.-F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S.

A second consequence of this movement would be the rupture of the interaction between residues in α1 and α2 helices, making these helices available for further interactions with other pro-apoptotic partners (22Cartron P.-F.

The NMR structure of full-length soluble Bax (8Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) has provided a powerful tool to predict, at a molecular level, the conformational changes that occur during the activation of Bax. The movements of the ART region and α1 helix were predicted from the observation that the 6A7 epitope, which covers the end of the ART region and the beginning of α1 helix, was masked in inactive Bax and became unmasked in active Bax (16Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). A recently published work confirmed this prediction, by showing that the exposure of this epitope required a movement of nearly 10 Å (23Peyerl F.W. Dai S. Murphy G.A. Crawford F. White J. Marrack P. Kappler J.W. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A great uncertainty still remains as to know how Bax is inserted in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Based on the demonstration that the C-terminal hydrophobic domains of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are required for their membrane addressing and function (24Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Yong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Janiak F. Leber B. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9842-9849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a similar property has been proposed for the C-terminal (α9) helix of Bax. Indeed, deletion or substitutions of the Ser184 residue within this helix resulted in constitutively green fluorescent protein-Bax addressing to mitochondria (7Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Moreover, a peptide corresponding to Bax-α9 was shown to insert into artificial membranes, a property that was enhanced by the deletion of Ser184 (26Martinez-Senac M.M. Corbalan-Garcia S. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9983-9989Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition to the α9 helix, the α5 and α6 helices have been suggested to form an hairpin structure within the membrane, because their predicted structure is close to that of bacterial toxins (27Shendel S.L. Montal M. Reed J.C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Biochemical data showed that these helices could be inserted together (28Garcia-Saez A.J. Mingarro I. Perez-Paya E. Salgado J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10930-10943Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and are required for the pore activity of Bax (29Heimlich G. McKinnon A.D. Bernardo K. Brdiczka D. Reed J.C. Kain R. Kronke M. Jurgensmeier J.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, if there are few doubts about the fact that α9 helix is a transmembrane domain, its actual role in Bax insertion has been questioned. The deletion of α9 fully inhibited the addressing of a green fluorescent protein-Bax fusion in cells containing endogenous Bax (6Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.-T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.-G. Youle R.J. J.

The putative conformational changes of α9 have been stimulated by substituting Ala or Val for Pro168, located in the loop between α8 and α9 helices; like the full deletion of α9, these substitutions prevented Bax addressing in cells expressing endogenous intact Bax (32Schinzel A.

Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52566-52573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Conversely, the substitution of Bcl-xL helix, a true C-terminal membrane insertion domain, for α9 helix forced the mitochondrial localization of Bax but prevented its activation, suggesting that the insertion of Bax driven by its C-terminal end could not lead to an active conformation of the chimeric protein (33Oliver L. Priault M. Tremblais K. Le Cabellec M.-T. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Similarly, the addressing/insertion process of the variant carrying the Ser184 deletion was independent of the interaction with Tom22 (21Bellot G. Cartron P.-F. Er E. Oliver L. Juin P. Armstrong L.C. Bornstein P. Mihara K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), suggesting that this mutant, although inserted, did not display the accurate conformation. Moreover, a C-terminal c-myc-tagged Bax expressed in yeast was spontaneously inserted (31Priault M. Camougrand N. Chaudhuri B. Manon S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that the addition of a short hydrophilic C-terminal tag to Bax suffices to stimulate its insertion, independently of the interaction with Tom22. Interestingly, a recent study carried out with this type of tagged constructions (34Setoguchi K. Otera H. Mihara K. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5635-5647Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) did not reproduce the data showing the role of Tom22 that was previously evidenced with full-length, native proteins (21Bellot G.

These previous studies supported the view that slight movements in strategic positions might suffice to initiate profound conformational changes that allowed the shift from inactive/soluble to active/membrane-inserted Bax. Physiologically, such movements could result from the formation/disappearance of salt bridges via cycles of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of specific residues. Indeed, correlations between the phosphorylation of Bax and its capacity to initiate apoptosis have been reported. Phosphorylation of Ser184 by Akt/PKB 3The abbreviations used are: Akt/PKB, protein kinase B; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; PKA, protein kinase A. 3The abbreviations used are: Akt/PKB, protein kinase B; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; PKA, protein kinase A. has been shown to promote cell survival by preventing Bax translocation in different models (36Yamaguchi H.

J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18859-18867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). On the opposite, Ser163 phosphorylation, possibly driven by GSK3β, was able to initiate Bax activation in neuronal cells (40Linseman D.A. Butts B.D. Precht T.A. Phelps R.A. Le S.S. Laesig T.A. Bouchard R.J. Florez-McClure M.L. Heidenreich K.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 9993-10002Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Yeast happens to be a potent tool for these studies; even if some primitive form of programmed cell death has been observed in yeast (41Madeo F. Herker E. Wissing S. Jungwirth H. Eisenberg T. Frohlich K.U. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2004; 7: 655-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), Bax expression was not able to trigger this process (42Kissova I. Plamondon L.-T. Brisson L.

Consequently, yeast allows assaying the interaction of Bax with mitochondria in a living cell, independently of the apoptotic network. When native full-length human Bax was expressed in yeast, the protein remained in the cytosol, like in healthy mammalian cells (18Priault M. Cartron P.-F. Camougrand N. Antonsson B. Vallette F.M. Manon S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The destabilization of the soluble conformation by mutating the N- or the C-terminal end or by substituting crucial residues was enough to initiate the translocation of the protein to the mitochondrial outer membrane followed by the relocalization of cytochrome c (18Priault M.

Bornstein P. Mihara K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies demonstrated that, under these conditions, a large channel with properties similar to those of the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel was created in the mitochondrial outer membrane of yeast cells (11Pavlov E.V. Priault M. Pietkiewicz D. Cheng E.H. Antonsson B. Manon S. Korsmeyer S.J. Mannella C.A. Kinnally K.W. J.

We have previously reported that numerous mutations in the ART, in the α1 helix, and within or around the α9 helix have the same consequences on Bax expressed in either yeast or Bax-deficient mammalian cells (17Cartron P.-F.

In the present study, we investigated further the effects of the introduction of point mutations at critical positions within Bax sequence, on Bax translocation, and on activity in yeast cells. This namely allows us to hypothesize that known and putative phosphorylations of serine residues could regulate Bax activation. Strains and Plasmids—The wild-type haploid yeast strain W303-1B (mat a, ade2, his3, leu2, trp1, ura3) was used throughout this study. The gene encoding complete human Bax without tags was cloned between the EcoRI and PmeI sites of the pYES3/CT plasmid (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutageneses were done using the QuikChange method (Stratagene) with 27-mer nucleotides (MWG Biotech). The whole mutant Bax genes were entirely sequenced on both strands to verify the introduction of the desired substitutions and the absence of additional mutations. Cultures and Mitochondria Isolation—Yeast cells were grown aerobically at 28 °C in a synthetic medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.1% potassium phosphate, 0.2% Drop Mix, 0.01% auxotrophic requirements, 2% dl-lactate, pH 5.5). Because the pYES3/CT plasmid bears the TRP1 gene, tryptophan was omitted in the medium for a positive selection of the plasmid. The cells were grown to an optical density of 0.5 at 550 nm (5 × 106 cells/ml). 0.5% galactose was added to the medium to trigger Bax expression, and the cells were further grown for 14 h. Typically, the optical density of the cultures reached 4-6 units at 550 nm. The levels of expression of the different Bax mutants were measured on whole cell extracts (20Arokium H. Camougrand N. Vallette F.M. Manon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52566-52573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and were comparable (Fig. 1), showing that the different substitutions did not strongly alter the stability of the protein in yeast. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation from zymolyase-treated cells, as described previously (20Arokium H. Camougrand N. Vallette F.M. Manon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52566-52573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—50 μg of mitochondrial proteins were loaded onto 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto polyvinyldifluoride difluoride membranes (Problott; Applied Biosystems). The membranes were saturated with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% Tween 20 and probed with a polyclonal anti-Bax antibody (N20; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies; 1/5,000) and a monoclonal anti-yeast porin antibody (Molecular Probes; 1/5,000). Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were from Jackson and used at 1/10,000. Peroxidase activity was revealed by chemioluminescence (ECL+; Amersham Biosciences). Cytochrome Measurements—Mitochondria suspensions (5 mg proteins/ml) were placed in the cuvettes of a double-beam/double wavelength spectrophotometer (Aminco DW2000). The content of the reference cuvette was oxidized with potassium ferricyanide, and that of the sample cuvette was reduced with sodium dithionite. The difference spectra were acquired between 500 and 650 nm. Cytochromes content was measured from the differences of absorbance 550-540, 561-575, and 603-630 for c, b, and aa3, respectively. Cytochrome b is a membrane protein that is not released and served as an internal standard. The results were then expressed as cytochrome c/cytochrome b concentration ratios (20Arokium H. Camougrand N. Vallette F.M. Manon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52566-52573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). [32P]Phosphate Labeling—The cells were grown in a low phosphate synthetic medium (2 ml) until the culture reached a cell density of 5 × 106 cells/ml (44Pinson B. Pillois X. Brèthes D. Chevallier J. Napias C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 0.5% galactose were added to induce Bax expression, and [32P]phosphate (0.25mCi/ml) was added 2 h later. After a 2-h incubation, the cells were centrifuged, washed twice, and treated with zymoliase (10 mg/ml) for 1 h. The cells were centrifuged, washed twice, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (IP50 kit; Sigma) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Biochemicals), 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. 2 μg of monoclonal anti-Bax antibody (2D2; Sigma) was added, and the lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-coupled agarose beads (IP50; Sigma) were added and incubated for 8 h. Washing and recuperation of the samples were done following the manufacturer's instructions. Identical samples were loaded in parallel onto two SDS-PAGE gels and blotted. One was revealed by autoradiography, and the other was probed with the polyclonal anti-Bax antibody. Ionic Interactions Participate in the Stabilization of Bax under an Inactive Conformation—NMR data obtained on soluble Bax highlighted the mobility of the ART (8Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Increasing further this mobility by substituting glycine for Pro13 sufficed to constitutively address Bax to mammalian mitochondria (19Cartron P.-F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the double substitution of glycine for Pro8/Pro13 had a similar effect in yeast (20Arokium H. Camougrand N. Vallette F.M. Manon S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52566-52573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It should be noted that the four residues located between the two prolines (Arg-Gly-Gly-Gly) are expected to confer a high flexibility to this zone. The examination of the structure of inactive Bax (8Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) allowed the prediction that a movement of the ART region between two extreme conformations observed by NMR would result in a movement of Arg9 Cα of nearly 11 Å (Fig. 2). Interestingly, under the tightest conformation of the ART region, there is some proximity (7.3 Å in average) between the positive charge of residue Arg9 in the ART sequence and the negative charge of residue Asp154 in α7 helix (Fig. 2). Although this distance is out of the range required to form a stable ion pair (<4 Å), it remains potentially close enough to allow a weak interaction between these two residues. When Arg9 Cα moves with the ART region, these two charges likely move away from each other at an average distance of 12.7 Å. In addition, the axes of the charges move from an angle of 111° under the tight conformation to an angle of 80° under the open conformation, which might further contribute to the loss of interaction between these charges. To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out at these two positions. The single substitutions of Glu for Arg9 or of Lys for Asp154 triggered a massive addressing of Bax to mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the addressed proteins were active because they triggered the translocation of cytochrome c (Fig. 3B) to the cytosol. On the opposite, the double-substitution Arg9 to Glu/Asp154 to Lys led to a protein that, like native Bax (Arg9/Asp154), was not translocated to mitochondria. These data support the hypothesis that the presence of opposite charges at positions 9 and 154 participates in the stabilization of ART tight conformation. A second ionic interaction between Asp33, in α1 helix, and Lys64, in α2 helix, participating in the stabilization of α1 helix within the Bax structure had previously been identified (22Cartron P.-F. Gallenne T. Bougras G. Gautier F. Manero F. Vusio P. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Juin P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 807-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These charges potentially form an ion pair (distance is ∼4Å; Fig. 4A) and substitutions of Ala for Asp33 or of Asp for Lys64 activate Bax in mammalian cells (22Cartron P.-F. Gallenne T. Bougras G. Gautier F. Manero F. Vusio P. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Juin P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 807-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A similar effect of these substitutions has been observed in yeast because the single mutants Ala33 and Asp64 were able to promote the release of cytochrome c (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the single Lys33 substitution did not activate Bax, because that could have been expected from the repulsive effect of Lys33/Lys64. This suggested that, in this mutant, a neighboring negative charge might interact with Lys33 and favor the maintenance of α1 helix in the “closed” conformation. The observation of Bax structure did not reveal the presence of any negative charges close enough to explain this inhibitory effect. However, a serine residue in position 60 lies in a consensus PKA phosphorylation site (Lys-Lys-Leu-Ser) and at less than 4 Å from Asp33 (Fig. 4A"
https://openalex.org/W1968420580,"The passive observation of hand actions is associated with increased motor cortex excitability, presumably reflecting activity within the human mirror neuron system (MNS). Recent data show that in-group ethnic membership increases motor cortex excitability during observation of culturally relevant hand gestures, suggesting that physical similarity with an observed body part may modulate MNS responses. Here, we ask whether the MNS is preferentially activated by passive observation of hand actions that are similar or dissimilar to self in terms of sex and skin color. Transcranial magnetic stimulation-induced motor evoked potentials were recorded from the first dorsal interosseus muscle while participants viewed videos depicting index finger movements made by female or male participants with black or white skin color. Forty-eight participants equally distributed in terms of sex and skin color participated in the study. Results show an interaction between self-attributes and physical attributes of the observed hand in the right motor cortex of female participants, where corticospinal excitability is increased during observation of hand actions in a different skin color than that of the observer. Our data show that specific physical properties of an observed action modulate motor cortex excitability and we hypothesize that in-group/out-group membership and self-related processes underlie these effects."

Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are multiple regulatory mechanisms that modulate PMN activation so that the amplitude of the cellular response matches the intensity of the stimulus. One such mechanism is priming, whereby the functional response of PMN to an activating stimulus is amplified by previous interaction with a priming agent. Diverse agents prime PMN, including microbial components and soluble host proteins, and both the underlying mechanisms of priming and the phenotype of the primed PMN are dependent on the identity of the stimulus (for review, see Ref. 2Condliffe A.M. Kitchen E. Chilvers E.R. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 1998; 94: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide, a component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria and a potent inflammatory mediator, primes PMN for marked enhancement of the respiratory burst in response to formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF) (3Aida Y. Pabst M.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3017-3025PubMed Google Scholar), opsonized zymosan (4Follin P. Dahlgren C. Inflammation. 1992; 16: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and PMA (5Forehand J.R. Bomalski J.S. Johnston Jr., R.B. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1991; 297: 65-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipopolysaccharide stimulation also primes PMN for degranulation and elastase release in response to fMLF (6Fittschen C. Sandhaus R.A. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1988; 43: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and for changes in adhesion (7Condliffe A.M. Chilvers E.R. Haslett C. Dransfield I. Immunology. 1996; 89: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Priming occurs in vivo and primed PMNs have been demonstrated in the circulation of patients after traumatic injury (8Ogura H. Tanaka H. Koh T. Hashiguchi N. Kuwagata Y. Hosotsubo H. Shimazu T. Sugimoto H. J. Trauma. 1999; 46: 774-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), during the course of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (9Chollet-Martin S. Montravers P. Gibert C. Elbim C.

Seeds M.C. McCall C.E. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 860-866PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, low concentrations of endotoxin are present in the plasma of patients with Gram-negative bacterial infections (11Venet C. Zeni F. Viallon A. Ross A. Pain P. Gery P. Page D. Vermesch R. Bertrand M. Rancon F. Bertrand J.C. Intensive Care Med. 2000; 26: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Therefore, the study of endotoxin-mediated priming is highly relevant to disease pathogenesis. The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent enzyme complex that produces substantial quantities of ROS necessary for optimal microbicidal activity against certain pathogens. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) lack a functional NADPH oxidase and are prone to frequent and serious infections (12Segal B.H. Leto T.L. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. Holland S.M. Medicine (Baltimore). 2000; 79: 170-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Oxidant signaling in PMN has also been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of integrin activation (13Blouin E. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Rieu P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3419-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), apoptosis (14Watson R.W. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and priming by select agents (15Bouaouina M. Blouin E. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Lesavre P. Rieu P. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Impaired oxidant signaling in PMN might contribute to the complex phenotype of CGD. We recently described the involvement of the anion transporter ClC-3 in NADPH oxidase activation of PMNs in response to both particulate and soluble stimuli (16Moreland J.G. Davis A.P. Bailey G. Nauseef W.M. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12277-12288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Concurrently, studies conducted in vascular smooth muscle cells have demonstrated impaired cytokine-initiated redox signaling in Clcn3–/– cells (17Miller Jr., F.J. Filali M. Huss G.J. Stanic B.

We investigated priming in PMNs as a process similar to cytokine-induced signaling in other cell types, as tumor necrosis factor-α is a well described priming agent. We hypothesized that NADPH oxidase-derived oxidants serve as signals during endotoxin-mediated priming and that ClC-3 participates as a regulator of NADPH oxidase function. The development of the primed phenotype in response to endotoxin, including enhancement of the respiratory burst to fMLF, up-regulation of intracellular stores of receptors, and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, required NADPH oxidase activation and ClC-3 function. Unexpectedly, we also found that low, tonic levels of NADPH oxidase-derived ROS were required for the maintenance of the non-primed quiescent state. Our data suggest that ClC-3 is proximally involved in oxidant-dependent events in the PMN, including endotoxin priming and the maintenance of cellular quiescence. Materials—Hanks' balanced salt solution was obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). Polyclonal antibody to ClC-3 was from Sigma. Rabbit anti-p38 MAPK and anti-phosphorylated threonine and tyrosine p38 MAPK were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Murine anti-human CD11b was purchased from Pharmingen, and rat-anti-mouse CD11b was purchased from the Developmental Hybridoma bank at the University of Iowa. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG+IgM and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Mouse IgG1 was purchased from Sigma, and rat IgG2 was purchased from BIOSOURCE. Antibody to the gp91phox component of the flavocytochrome b558 was generated by Dr. Nauseef (clone 7D5). Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) purified from Neisseria meningitidis and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) were generous gifts from Dr. Jerrold Weiss. Niflumic acid (NFA) was purchased from Sigma, dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 10–1 m, and used at a final concentration of 10–3 m. Additional reagents were all obtained from Sigma. Clcn3–/– Mice and Murine Leukocyte Isolation—Generation of the Clcn3–/– mice with a C57Bl/6J-SV129 background has been previously described (18Dickerson L.W. Bonthius D.J. Schutte B.C. Yang B. Barna T.J. Bailey M.C. Nehrke K. Williamson R.A. Lamb F.S. Brain Res. 2002; 958: 227-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All animals had free access to food and water. Experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Iowa. For isolation of murine PMNs from bone marrow, mice were euthanized, and then the femur, tibia, and iliac bones were removed and stripped of all tissue. Distal and proximal ends of each bone were transected, a 25-gauge needle was inserted into the shaft, and cold buffered Hanks' balanced salt solution was used to flush out bone marrow cells. Cells were pelleted at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C then suspended in 3 ml of 45% Percoll. Percoll density gradient was made in a 15-ml tube by layering successively 2 ml each of 62, 55, and 50% Percoll on top of 3 ml of 81% Percoll. Leukocytes were then gently loaded on top of gradient. Cells were centrifuged at 1600 × g for 30 min at 10 °C, and PMNs were harvested between 81 and 62% layers and washed to remove Percoll. Human PMN Purification—Human PMNs were isolated according to standard techniques from heparin anti-coagulated venous blood from healthy consenting adults in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects at the University of Iowa. PMNs were isolated using dextran sedimentation and Hypaque-Ficoll density-gradient separation followed by hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes as previously described (19Boyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1968; 97: 77-89Google Scholar). Measurement of NADPH Oxidase Activity Chemiluminescence—Lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence (LUC-CL) assays of NADPH oxidase activity were performed in a 96-well plate using the Wallac Victor3 luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 200 μl of a PMN suspension containing 2.5 × 106 PMNs/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 1% human serum albumin and 0.1% dextrose was added to each well with a final concentration of lucigenin 100 μm. Cells were stimulated by the addition of LOS (10 ng/ml) in the presence of LBP (100 ng/ml) ± fMLF as specified. Chemiluminescence was quantitated as relative luminescence units using a kinetic assay with readings every minute for 30–90 min. Reduction of Ferricytochrome c—Extracellular O2 generation was measured as the superoxide-dismutase (SOD)-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c in a 96-well microplate using the SPECTRmax plus (Molecular Devices). PMN suspensions were diluted and added to the microplate as described above. Cytochrome c (100 μm) was added to the suspension just before loading in the microplate. In duplicate wells, SOD was added at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. The maximum rate (Vmax) of O2 generation and the total nmol O2 was calculated as the SOD-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c, with readings at absorbance 550 nm every 15 s for 30 min after injection of the stimulus as specified. Effect of Anion Channel Inhibition on ClC-3 Current—The short (see GenBank™ X78520) N-terminal isoform of human ClC-3 was PCR-amplified and cloned into the adenovirus shuttle plasmid pacAd5 CMV. Bicistronic adenoviruses co-expressing ClC-3 (Ad-ClC-3) behind the cytomegalovirus promoter and enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) behind the Rous sarcoma virus promoter were prepared and titrated by the University of Iowa Vector core. Control adenovirus expressed only eGFP (Ad-eGFP). HEK293 cells (HEK293T, adenoviral propagation-resistant) were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were infected with adenovirus in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h before being returned to their standard serum concentration where the virus was allowed to express for 48 h before experimentation. Chloride ion currents were measured at room temperature (22 °C) using standard whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques with an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier driven by pClamp 9 software (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Pipette resistances were 3–5 megaohms. Pipette and whole-cell capacitance and series resistance were compensated. Holding potential was –40 mV and 1-s test pulses were delivered every 3 s to test potentials from –100 to +100 mV in 20-mV increments. Currents were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. The standard bath solution contained 120 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.2 with NaOH, and osmolality was titrated to 300 mosmol by osmometer (μ OSMETTE) using 1 m mannitol. Liquid junction potentials were minimized by using 3 m KCl agar bridges. Pipette solutions for standard whole cell recordings contained 120 mm CsCl, 4 mm triethylammonium chloride, 5 mm EGTA, 1.187 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na-ATP, 0.5 mm Na-GTP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 with CsOH, osmolality was 290 mosmol, and free [Ca2+] was 55 nm (calculated using WEBMAXC). Currents were expressed as current density (pA/picofarads). GFP-positive cells were identified using a fluorescence-equipped inverted microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 25). Analysis of Cell Surface Receptor Expression and Intracellular p38 Levels by Flow Cytometry—PMNs at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml were analyzed using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). For surface expression of flavocytochrome b558 and CD11b, PMNs were incubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution alone or in the presence of LOS/LBP in the presence or absence of NFA or diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) as specified. After incubation, PMNs were centrifuged and resuspended in blocking buffer containing phosphate-buffered saline with 2% nonfat dry milk and 1% normal goat serum for 20 min on ice. Primary antibodies were added after blocking; mouse IgG1 control, anti CD11b, or anti-gp91phox, all at final concentrations of 10 μg/ml and incubated for 1 h on ice. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse at 1:1000 dilution and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cells were resuspended in buffer containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide before analysis. Analysis of murine PMN p38 levels were performed on Clcn3+/+ and Clcn3–/– PMNs that were exposed to LOS/LBP as described and then fixed in 2% formaldehyde for 10 min and placed on ice for 1 min followed by centrifugation and permeabilization with 90% methanol on ice for 30 min. Samples were analyzed for levels of anti-total p38 and anti-phospho-p38 using the manufacturer's recommended dilutions. Analysis of p38 MAPK Phosphorylation—PMNs (2 × 107) were treated with purified LOS/LBP for the specified time points. Some PMNs were treated with inhibitors (DPI, N-acetylcysteine (N-Ac), rotenone, NFA) at the specified concentration before incubation with LOS. After incubation, cells were centrifuged and lysed in PMN lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2% leupeptin/pepstatin A) for 45 min at 4 °C with tumbling. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 7 min and removed to fresh tubes, and samples were heated to 103 °C for 3 min before analysis by SDS-PAGE. To quantify total p38 MAPK, blots were stripped and reprobed with a phosphorylation state-independent anti-p38 MAPK antibody. Protein Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Samples were resolved in an 11% gel by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblots were processed using polyclonal antibody specific for phospho-p38 or total p38 MAPK and horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Super Signal Substrate, Pierce). Immunoblots were scanned using the Typhoon imager (Amersham Biosciences), and relative abundances were quantitated using ImageQuant software for the PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA). Diminished LOS Priming in Murine Clcn3–/– PMNs—To explore the contribution of ClC-3 to LOS priming, we measured the respiratory burst in Clcn3+/+ and Clcn3–/– murine PMNs by fMLF using LUC-CL. fMLF is a relatively weak activator of NADPH oxidase activity in otherwise unstimulated PMNs; however, exposure to a priming agent resulted in a 5–10-fold augmentation of subsequent fMLF-stimulated ROS production. We used a highly purified LOS from N. meningitidis as the priming agent (20Giardina P.C. Gioannini T. Buscher B.A. Zaleski A. Zheng D.S. Stoll L. Teghanemt A. Apicella M.A. Weiss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5883-5891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although there were minimal ROS generated in response to fMLF at 1–10 μm, 100 μm fMLF elicited similar levels of NADPH oxidase activity in both Clcn3+/+ and Clcn3–/– PMNs (Fig. 1A). In Clcn3+/+ PMNs, LOS exposure (10 ng/ml) elicited robust NADPH oxidase activity, whereas Clcn3–/– PMNs had less than 50% of the NADPH oxidase activity by comparison (Fig. 1B). We detected a transient but significant increase in ROS in response to fMLF 100 μm in LOS-primed murine PMNs (Fig. 1C and inset). This primed burst was 2-fold increased in Clcn3+/+ versus Clcn3–/– PMNs. Abnormal Priming of the Respiratory Burst in PMNs after Anion Transporter Inhibition—In view of the well defined differences between human and murine PMNs (21Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 401-403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mestas J. Hughes C.C. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2731-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar), we utilized the anion channel inhibitor NFA to extend our findings of abnormal NADPH oxidase activity in Clcn3–/– PMNs to human PMNs. In response to fMLF (1 μm) alone, naïve PMN exhibited a small burst of NADPH oxidase activity detected in both control and NFA-treated PMNs (Fig. 2A). In response to the priming stimulus alone (LOS 10 ng/ml), ROS were generated, but in a delayed fashion and with significantly diminished production by the NFA-treated PMNs in comparison to control PMNs (Fig. 2B). fMLF (1 μm) injected after priming elicited a markedly enhanced respiratory burst in control PMN, whereas the NFA-treated PMNs did not generate ROS after fMLF above the background levels generated by the priming stimulus (Fig. 2C). Because lucigenin is not specific for superoxide detection and cannot be used quantitatively, we examined the effect of NFA treatment on LOS-priming of NADPH oxidase activity using the SOD-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c. Extracellular superoxide generation in response to LOS alone was very low. Control PMNs primed for 30 min with LOS and then stimulated with fMLF generated 1.38 ± 0.109 nmol O2 PMN/10 min versus 0.15 ± 0.007 nmol O2 PMN/10 min in NFA-treated PMNs. Taken together with our previous findings of decreased NADPH oxidase activation in NFA-treated PMNs after opsonized zymosan or PMA stimulation (16Moreland J.G. Davis A.P. Bailey G. Nauseef W.M. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12277-12288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), these data suggested a role for anion transport and ClC-3 during LOS priming. The Anion Channel Inhibitor Niflumic Acid Inhibits ClC-3 Current—Although we previously suggested that NFA inhibits ClC-3 function (16Moreland J.G. Davis A.P. Bailey G. Nauseef W.M. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12277-12288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we recognized that electrophysiological evidence that NFA blocked the ClC-3 current was required. Using a heterologous adenoviral ClC-3 expression system, we assessed the effects of NFA on ClC-3 currents in HEK293 cells. The basic biophysical properties of the currents induced by ClC-3 overexpression were very similar to those previously published for ClC-4 and ClC-5 (23Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and consistent with ClC-3 functioning as a chloride proton exchanger at physiologic pH (24Scheel O. Zdebik A.A. Lourdel S. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 2005; 436: 424-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 25Picollo A. Pusch M. Nature. 2005; 436: 420-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). ClC-3 currents were sharply outwardly rectifying, strongly favoring Cl– movement from the extracellular to the intracellular compartment (Fig. 3, A and B). 3J. J. Matsuda, M. S. Filali, K. A. Volk, M. M. Collins, J. G. Moreland, and F. S. Lamb, submitted for publication. NFA (1 mm) significantly inhibited this current (Fig. 3C) with a mean percent inhibition of 57 ± 4.2% (mean ± S.E., n = 7) at a test potential of +80 mV. Thus, NFA clearly inhibited ClC-3 current and can be used to assess the contribution of ClC-3 currents to PMN function. Oxidants Generated in Response to LOS Priming Are Both Extracellular and Intracellular—According to current understanding of PMN NADPH oxidase activity, the oxidase assembles at the plasma membrane in response to soluble agonists and generates extracellular ROS but assembles at the phagosomal membrane to generate intraphagosomal ROS after a particulate stimulus. However, several studies suggest that the oxidase can assemble on vesicular or granular membranes and generate ROS into an intracellular, non-phagosomal compartment (26Kobayashi T. Robinson J.M. Seguchi H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 81-91Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Brown G.E. Stewart M.Q. Liu H. Ha V.L. Yaffe M.B. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 35-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Ambruso D.R. Cusack N. Thurman G. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2004; 81: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our data with LUC-CL suggested that ROS were generated during the priming response to LOS, but minimal extracellular superoxide was measured by ferricytochrome c. To locate the ROS produced during LOS priming, we investigated the effect of added extracellular SOD on the recovery of ROS produced directly in response to LOS. Extracellular SOD significantly inhibited NADPH oxidase activity stimulated by LOS as detected by LUC-CL, and the membrane-permeable PEG-SOD reduced detectable ROS levels below background (Fig. 4A). After LOS priming in the presence of either extracellular SOD or PEG-SOD, cells were centrifuged and washed to remove SOD and then stimulated with fMLF. The primed fMLF burst in PMN that were LOS-primed in the presence of extracellular SOD was identical to control PMN but was completely inhibited in cells primed in the presence of PEG-SOD (Fig. 4B). Cells treated with PEG-SOD and then washed had normal responses to PMA, indicating that there was adequate removal of the permeable dismutase (data not shown). These data suggest that intracellular ROS generated during priming are required for the development of the primed burst. We reasoned that if priming requires ROS, cells primed in an anaerobic environment would not demonstrate amplification in the fMLF-stimulated respiratory burst. To test this hypothesis, we primed cells with LOS in an anaerobic chamber and then removed the cells to room air immediately before stimulation with fMLF. PMN primed in the anaerobic chamber had near complete inhibition of the fMLF-induced burst in comparison to PMN primed in room air (Fig. 4C). PMA-stimulated NADPH oxidase activity was identical to control cells in PMN removed from the anaerobic chamber after 30 min, suggesting that the conditions had not permanently altered the ability of the NADPH oxidase to function (data not shown). Oxygen concentration in the chamber was estimated to be <1% based on PMA-stimulated superoxide generation as measured by the reduction of ferricytochrome c as compared with previous studies performed under anaerobic conditions (29Gabig T.G. Bearman S.I. Babior B.M. Blood. 1979; 53: 1133-1139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly support the hypothesis that endotoxin-elicited priming of the respiratory burst is an oxygen-dependent process and requires intracellular generation of ROS. Impaired Mobilization of the Flavocytochrome b558 and CD11b in NFA-treated and Clcn3–/– PMNs—To examine the impact of ClC-3 on LOS priming, we examined up-regulation of cell surface expression of gp91phox, a subunit of the flavocytochrome b558 (cyt b558), as a manifestation of priming (30DeLeo F. Renee J. McCormick S. Nakamura M. Apicella M. Weiss J. Nauseef W. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and of CD11b/CD18. PMNs incubated with LOS for 30 min increased surface expression of cyt b558 by 128 ± 40.3%, whereas NFA-treated PMNs showed virtually no increase after LOS (Fig. 5A). CD11b expression was similarly affected (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, NFA treatment of PMNs in the absence of other stimulation elicited a 2.2-fold increase above basal cyt b558 levels and a 2.9-fold increase in CD11b expression (Fig. 5, C and D). These data raised the issue of whether the failure of LOS to elicit up-regulation of cyt b558 and CD11b in NFA-treated cells was secondary to the fact that intracellular stores were fully mobilized by the NFA alone. However, it appears that the “priming” effect of LOS and NFA are additive (see Fig. 9).FIGURE 9Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in response to LOS in murine PMNs as assessed by flow cytometry. After 10 min of incubation with LOS (10 ng/ml), murine PMNs displayed two populations of cells by flow cytometry for phosphorylated p38 MAPK.

B, representative histogram from Clcn3–/– PMNs also displayed a population of cells with enhanced phosphorylation, but this was reduced in comparison to the wild-type PMNs. C, the increase in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for phospho-p38 was significantly greater in Clcn3+/+ PMNs as compared with Clcn3–/–PMNs. n = 5 mice/strain. *, significantly different from wild type, p < 0.05. D, the percentage of cells with high levels of phospho-p38 was also increased in Clcn3+/+ PMNs as compared with Clcn3–/– PMNs. n = 5 mice/strain. *, significantly different from wild-type, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the effects of NFA on receptor expression resulted from inhibition of ClC-3, we compared CD11b expression in Clcn3+/+ and Clcn3–/– murine PMNs. In Clcn3+/+ PMNs, LOS priming induced a 288% increase in surface CD11b expression (Fig. 6, A and C). Clcn3–/– PMNs also demonstrated an increase in CD11b after LOS; however, it was significantly reduced from that seen in the wild-type PMNs (Fig. 6, B and C). In addition, similar to NFA-treated human PMNs, basal surface levels of CD11b were 1.5-fold increased in Clcn3–/– PMNs as compared with Clcn3+/+ (Fig. 6D). Considered in combination, the human and murine data suggest a spec"

We show that a charge reversal in a conserved motif in the synthesis domains explains this contrast; an RXKD motif in the bifunctional proteins is reversed to an EXDD motif. The differential response of these proteins to Mg2+ could also be noticed in fluorescent nucleotide binding and circular dichroism experiments. In mutants where the motifs were reversed, the differential effect could also be reversed.

Synthesis and hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp are carried out by two distinct domains in the N-terminal region of the Rel family of proteins that are divided into a bifunctional class (that synthesizes and hydrolyzes) and a monofunctional class (that can only synthesize). This difference arises due to the absence of a well conserved HDXXED motif required for (p)ppGpp hydrolysis in the latter. Although the N-terminal (∼1–395) region of these proteins is sufficient to catalyze synthesis and hydrolysis reactions, the C-terminal domain ensures regulation of these antagonistic activities (14Jain V. Saleem-Batcha R. Chatterji D. Biophys. Chem. 2007; 127: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Avarbock A. Avarbock D.J.S. Buckstein M. Wang Z.M. Rubin H.

The synthesizing domains of Rel proteins are classified along with enzymes that catalyze a pyrophosphate transfer reaction. Although most of these enzymes utilize a dual divalent cation mechanism, Rel has been proposed to follow a single-cation mechanism. This proposal was based on the following observations. (p)ppGpp synthesis by the bifunctional Rel proteins from M. tuberculosis (RelMtb) and Streptococcus equisimilis (RelSeq) is inhibited when Mg2+ concentration is higher than that of NTPs, which is not the case for proteins employing a dual divalent cation mechanism (16Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 469-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 17Avarbock D. Avarbock A. Rubin H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11640-11648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Mechold U. Murphy H. Brown L. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 194: 2878-2888Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Besides this, RelSeq structure identified the palm domain of DNA polymerase (Polβ), also known to follow a dual cation mechanism (19Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) as the closest relative of the synthesis domain. Of the three conserved Asp residues that coordinate two Mg2+ ions in Polβ, only two carboxylic groups, namely Asp-264 and Glu-323, are conserved in RelSeq. These were implicated in coordinating the catalytic Mg2+ along with ATP in the active site (20Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Cell. 2004; 117: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The observed inhibition of (p)ppGpp synthesis at high Mg2+, the absence of a third conserved carboxylic residue, and the lack of electron density for Mg2+ in RelSeq, despite supplying it during crystallization, led Hogg et al. (20Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Cell. 2004; 117: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) to propose a single-cation mechanism for Rel proteins. Surprisingly, in contrast to the bifunctional RelMtb and RelSeq, we did not find inhibition of pppGpp synthesis at higher Mg2+ by their monofunctional homologue in Escherichia coli (RelAE. coli). We associate this contrast to a charge reversal in a conserved motif in the synthesizing domains of Rel proteins. An RXKD motif in the bifunctional proteins is substituted by an EXDD motif in the monofunctional proteins, which possibly forms a second metal binding site other than the one used by catalytic Mg2+. The significance of these motifs in determining the differential effect of Mg2+ on (p)ppGpp synthesis is further substantiated by fluorescent nucleotide binding and circular dichroism (CD) experiments (21Remmers A.E. Posner R. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13771-13778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kelly S.M. Jess T.J. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys.

Cloning, Expression, and Purification—The bifunctional RelMtb consists of 790 amino acids. PCR product corresponding to the N-terminal domain (amino acids 53–446) of M. tuberculosis rel was amplified using forward (5′-TTAGAATTCCATATGACCGCCCAACGCAGCACCACC-3′) and reverse (5′-GGATCCAAGCTTTTACCAGTCGAGCAGCTGACGCATCCA-3′) primers from M. tuberculosis genomic DNA using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The amplicon was digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned into corresponding sites in the pQE-2 expression vector (Qiagen). E. coli RelA consists of 744 residues, of which the N-terminal domain (1–395) was amplified from its genomic DNA using primers 5′-GTTGCGGCATATGGTTGCGGTAAGAAGTGC-3′ and 5′-AATAAGCTTTAAGCTGCGTACTTCGTCGAG-3′ and similarly cloned into pQE-2 vector. Protein expression was carried out in E. coli. DH5α cells from 500 ml of growth medium were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 5% glycerol. Cells were lysed by sonication. The supernatant, clarified by centrifugation at 35,000 relative centrifugal force for 30 min, was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm imidazole. For eluting the protein, an imidazole gradient of 20 column volumes (0–0.5 M) was used, and the protein was eluted at 20% of the gradient. The purified protein was then subjected to gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences). The buffer was exchanged with 50 mm HEPES, (pH 8), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The monomer fractions of the proteins were collected and stored at -80 °C after snap-freezing in liquid N2. Here, the N-terminal halves of Rel proteins from M. tuberculosis (53–446) and E. coli (1–395) are referred to as RelMtb and RelAE. coli, respectively, unless mentioned otherwise. pppGpp Synthesis Assays—pppGpp synthesis assays were carried out in a 5-μl reaction volume containing 0–50 mm HEPES (pH 8), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 5 μm Rel proteins at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 μl of 6 m formic acid. The mixture was then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. 5 μl of the sample was spotted on the polyethyleneimine-coated TLC (Merck), resolved in 1.5 m KH2PO4 (pH 3.4) buffer, and subjected to autoradiography to detect the formation of pppGpp. Autoradiograms were aligned with the TLC plate, spots corresponding to pppGpp were cored out, and the counts (cpm) were determined using the scintillation counter. cpm obtained at 1 mm Mg2+ concentration was normalized to 100%. The percentage of activity for the other samples were calculated with respect to activity (cpm) at 1 mm Mg2+. Sequence Retrieval and Alignment—Protein sequences were obtained from SwissProt/Trembl (expasy.org/sprot/) and NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) databases. The protein sequences that belong to the Rel family were extracted and manually scanned for the presence of residues involved in (p)ppGpp synthesis and hydrolysis. An HDXXED motif in the hydrolyzing domains coordinates a Mn2+ ion and participates in (p)ppGpp hydrolysis reaction (16Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 469-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Therefore, the proteins were grouped into the bifunctional class when HDXXED motif was present and into the monofunctional class if it was absent since the latter can only synthesize (p)ppGpp. Multiple sequence alignment of all the sequences was performed using ClustalX (24Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35075) Google Scholar). Following this, careful manual examination ensured the alignment of conserved motifs. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the overlapping PCR method. Forward and reverse primers were designed with the desired change in the codon sequence (underlined in the primer sequence). In RelMtb, Arg-348 and Lys-350 were mutated to Glu and Asp, respectively. Primers used are as follows: RelMtb R348E/K350D forward primer, 5′-GATGGCGGGTGAGTTCGACGACTACATCGC-3′; RelMtb R348E/K350D reverse primer, 5′-GCGATGTAGTCGTCGAACTCACCCGCCATC-3′. In RelAE. coli, Glu-306 and Asp-308 were mutated to Arg and Lys, respectively. Primers used are as follows: RelE. coli E306R/D308K forward primer, 5′-CGCCACCTGCCCGGGCGGTTTAAGGATTACGTCGC-3′; RelAE. coli E306R/D308K reverse primer, 5′-GCGACGTAATCCTTAAACCGCCCGGGCAGGTGGCG-3′. In each case, the fragments were amplified using forward primer of the gene and the reverse primer containing the mutation and the reverse primer of the gene and the forward primer with the mutation. Amplicons were gel-purified, and equal quantities of both fragments were used as template for the second round of PCR amplification using forward and reverse primers originally used for amplifying the gene. The full-length amplicon for the mutant gene was digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned into corresponding sites in pQE-2 vector. mant-Nucleotide Binding Assays—Fluorescent nucleotide binding studies were carried out using LS 55 Fluorescence Spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at room temperature. The N-methyl-3′-O-anthranoyl (mant) group attached to the nucleotides was monitored with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm (slit width of 2.5 nm) and emission wavelength of 400–500 nm (slit width of 5 nm). Emission and excitation profiles of mant-nucleotides were generated from 0.2 μm free mant-GTP and mant-ATP in buffer. Protein mant-nucleotide complexes were generated by preincubating various concentrations of proteins (1–5 μm) with 0.2 μm mant-nucleotides in buffers supplemented with or without 1 mm EDTA for 10 min at room temperature. The effect of Mg2+ on the interaction of Rel proteins with mant-GTP and mant-ATP was determined by comparing with 0.2 μm mant-GTP or mant-ATP fluorescence and 4 μm proteins in a buffer supplemented with 0–10 mm MgCl2. Circular Dichroism Experiments—CD spectra were recorded at 22 °C on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. A total of 1 μm of the proteins was used for CD studies. Protein samples were filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (Millipore) prior to use. Scans were taken at a bandwidth 1.5 nm, response time 2 s, data pitch 0.2 nm, and scanning speed of 50 nm/min from 250 to 200 nm in a quartz cuvette of path length 1 mm. Spectra were averaged over 10 scans. pppGpp Synthesis by Monofunctional RelAE. coli Is Not Inhibited at Higher Mg2+ Concentrations—Rel proteins that are well characterized to synthesize and hydrolyze (p)ppGpp contain about 700–750 amino acids. Rigorous biochemical studies using RelMtb and RelSeq have shown that the N-terminal (∼1–395) region of these proteins is sufficient to catalyze these reactions efficiently (15Avarbock A. Avarbock D.J.S. Buckstein M. Wang Z.M. Rubin H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9913-9923Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 18Mechold U. Murphy H. Brown L. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 194: 2878-2888Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, for the proteins mentioned in this study, RelMtb, RelSeq and RelAE. coli indicate their N-terminal regions, whereas the full-length proteins are indicated explicitly, when required. A small excess of Mg2+, above that of the substrate concentration, was reported to drastically reduce (p)ppGpp synthesis by the bifunctional enzymes RelMtb (full-length) and RelSeq (17Avarbock D. Avarbock A. Rubin H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11640-11648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Mechold U. Murphy H. Brown L. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 194: 2878-2888Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A complete inhibition of synthetase activity was observed for the former, whereas a residual activity was seen in the latter. This difference seems to be due to the use of full-length RelMtb versus the N-terminal region (53–446) of RelSeq that was employed in the studies. Overall, Mg2+ seems to inhibit (p)ppGpp synthesis by bifunctional Rel proteins. We investigated whether Mg2+ can confer a similar effect on the synthesis activity by monofunctional RelAE. coli. The reaction was ATP + GTP → pppGpp + AMP; pppGpp synthesis by both RelMtb and RelAE. coli was measured (see “Experimental Procedures”) at constant levels of enzyme and substrates while varying Mg2+ concentrations from 0 to 50 mm (25 times higher than ATP/GTP concentration). Fig. 1A shows that the amount of pppGpp synthesized by RelMtb decreases significantly as the concentration of Mg2+ is increased. Here, unlike for RelMtb(full-length), a residual activity is observed as in the case of RelSeq (18Mechold U. Murphy H. Brown L. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 194: 2878-2888Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In contrast, the amount of pppGpp synthesized by RelAE. coli was not affected under similar conditions (Fig. 1B, and see also Fig. 3C). This indicates a clear difference in metal requirement by RelAE. coli and RelMtb, RelSeq, possibly suggesting differences in the reaction mechanism, despite a 59.3% sequence similarity in their synthesizing domains. The following studies were designed to further characterize this intriguing observation.FIGURE 3Mutant proteins, with motifs RXKD and EXDD interchanged, show a reversal of Mg2+-dependent inhibition. pppGpp synthesis assays were carried out on mutants MT-RelMtb (A) MT-RelAE. coli (B) under conditions identical to Fig. 1. The amount of pppGpp produced under varying MgCl2 is shown from lanes 1–7. Lane 1, negative control without the proteins; lane 2, 1 mm EDTA (0 mm MgCl2); lane 3, 2 mm MgCl2; lane 4, 5 mm MgCl2; lane 5, 10 mm MgCl2; lane 6, 25 mm MgCl2; lane 7, 50 mm MgCl2. C, quantitation of the results obtained from three independent experiments, similar to those shown in Fig. 1, A and B, and in panels A and B of this figure. Spots corresponding to pppGpp were cored out, and the counts were determined. The percentage of activity was calculated with respect to the activity at 1 mm Mg2+ that was normalized to 100%. The percentage of pppGpp synthesized by WT-RelMtb, MT-RelMtb, WT-RelAE. coli, and MT-RelAE. coli are plotted against increasing Mg2+ concentration (Mg2+ conc.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A Charge Reversal in a Conserved Motif Distinguishes the Bifunctional and Monofunctional Proteins—The differential response to Mg2+ by monofunctional RelAE. coli and bifunctional RelMtb, RelSeq enzymes led us to inquire whether this is an attribute of all monofunctional and bifunctional proteins. To corroborate this, we resorted to analyzing the sequences of all Rel proteins (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although the sequence alignment displayed several conserved motifs across species, our attempt to search for motifs that distinguish the bifunctional and monofunctional proteins led to the identification of a unique charge reversal in a conserved motif in the (p)ppGpp synthesizing domains. An RXKD motif, conserved in all the bifunctional proteins, is substituted by an EXDD motif, conserved in all the monofunctional proteins (Fig. 2). An examination of the available structure of RelSeq (20Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Cell. 2004; 117: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) hinted at the functional significance of this motif. The absence of bound Mg2+ in the structure, despite providing 5 mm MgCl2 during crystallization, indicated that GDP/GTP binding may be Mg2+-independent. The RXKD motif lies in close proximity to the GTP/GDP binding pocket and is well conserved in the bifunctional class. It appeared that this motif could possibly stabilize the β- and γ-phosphates of GTP. In monofunctional proteins, Arg and Lys are substituted by Glu and Asp, respectively, and the EXDD motif is well conserved. We argued that a Mg2+ ion coordinated by Glu and Asp provides a similar stabilization to GTP. This led us to hypothesize that, apart from the catalytic Mg2+ binding site in these proteins, EXDD forms a second Mg2+ binding site in the monofunctional proteins to stabilize GTP and that this charge reversal could explain the differential use of Mg2+ by Rel proteins. Further experiments were designed to verify this hypothesis, using mutant proteins that exchanged the RXKD and EXDD motifs in the bifunctional RelMtb and monofunctional RelAE. coli. Exchanging RXKD and EXDD Motifs Reverses the Effect of Mg2+ on pppGpp Synthesis—To verify whether interchanging RXKD and EXDD motifs would reverse the effect of Mg2+ on pppGpp synthesis, the conserved arginine (Arg-348) and lysine (Lys-350) residues in the RXKD motif of bifunctional RelMtb were mutated to Glu and Asp, respectively. Similarly, Glu-306 and Asp-308 in the EXDD motif of RelAE. coli were mutated to Arg and Lys, respectively. (Hereafter, the mutants are referred to with the prefix “MT,” and the wild type proteins are referred to with the prefix “WT.”) These mutants were purified, and pppGpp synthesis assays were conducted as earlier. In line with our proposal, the mutants reversed the effect of Mg2+ on pppGpp synthesis. Fig. 3A shows that the amount of pppGpp synthesized by MT-RelMtb is not inhibited at high Mg2+ when compared with WT-RelMtb (Fig. 1A). Conversely, Fig. 3B shows that pppGpp synthesis by MT-RelAE. coli is severely affected, unlike WT-RelAE. coli (Fig. 1B). These experiments clearly established (Fig. 3C) that the motifs RXKD and EXDD play significant roles in determining the differential effect of Mg2+ on (p)ppGpp synthesis by Rel proteins. It appears that the inhibitory effect at higher Mg2+ is seen for proteins having an RXKD motif and not if they have an EXDD motif (Fig. 3C). To further underscore the role of these motifs, fluorescent nucleotide binding and CD experiments were conducted. RXKD Motif Determines Mg2+-dependent Inhibitory Effect on (p)ppGpp Synthesis—mant-nucleotides are sensitive fluorescent probes to study nucleotide binding in proteins (21Remmers A.E. Posner R. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13771-13778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide analogues, mant-GTP and mant-ATP, were used to study the significance of RXKD and EXDD motifs in nucleotide binding under varying Mg2+ concentrations. Proteins having the RXKD motif, i.e. WT-RelMtb and MT-RelAE. coli, bound to mant-GTP and mant-ATP even in the presence of 1 mm EDTA (Fig. 4A, panels 1–4, colored blue), negating the need for Mg2+ in nucleotide binding. However, this effect was not obvious for WT-RelAE. coli and MT-RelMtb, having an EXDD motif (Fig. 4B) where no nucleotide binding could be detected. We presume that in these proteins, the nucleotide dissociation constants are very high at equilibrium, and therefore, nucleotide binding in the steady state does not lead to a significant increase in fluorescence. When the fluorescence experiment was conducted with increasing Mg2+, both GTP and ATP binding to WT-RelMtb reduced appreciably (Fig. 4A, panels 1 and 2). Similarly, MT-RelAE. coli (with RXKD) behaved like WT-RelMtb (Fig. 4A, panels 3 and 4) and showed a reduction in nucleotide binding. Interestingly, the exchange of motifs reversed the effect of Mg2+ to the extent that MT-RelMtb behaved like WT-RelAE. coli, wherein no nucleotide binding could be detected (Fig. 4B). In conclusion, these experiments clearly demonstrate that nucleotide binding is severely affected in the presence of higher Mg2+ when the proteins carry an RXKD motif (i.e. WT-RelMtb and MT-RelA E. coli). This is in line with the effect seen on pppGpp synthesis (Figs. 1 and 3). Mg2+ Induces a Structural Transition in RXKD-containing Rel Proteins—Based on the structure of RelSeq, an interesting feature suggested by Hogg et al. (20Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Cell. 2004; 117: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) is a structural transition of a loop (α13/β4 loop), termed “catalytic loop,” situated in the synthesis domain. This loop was postulated to be involved in Mg2+-ATP binding. As fluorescence studies revealed that Mg2+ affects nucleotide binding (Fig. 4), we wanted to test whether Mg2+ alone could influence any structural transitions in the protein. Thus, all CD experiments were carried out in the absence of nucleotides and with varying Mg2+ concentrations. We observed an increase in helical content for WT-RelMtb with increasing concentration of Mg2+ (Fig. 5A). However, under similar conditions, there was no significant difference in the helical content of WT-RelAE. coli (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, like the reversals in pppGpp synthesis and nucleotide binding, the structural transition (i.e. increase in helical content) was also reversed in MT-RelMtb having an EXDD motif (Fig. 5B). In MT-RelAE. coli where EXDD is replaced with RXKD, this reversal is not apparent at lower concentration of Mg2+ (up to 5 mm) but is clearly noticed at 10 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 5C). It is possible that an increase in helicity would be observed at higher concentrations if experimental limitations did not restrict us to minimal Mg2+ concentrations (22Kelly S.M. Jess T.J. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar, 23Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2000; 1: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Overall, the data from the CD experiments suggest that an increase in helical content in Rel proteins occurs only when they carry an RXKD motif and also that this effect is solely due to Mg2+ as ATP and GTP were not supplied in these experiments. Hence, together with the nucleotide binding studies, it is tempting to speculate that the increase in helical content is possibly associated with the loop-to-helix transition of the catalytic loop proposed by Hogg et al. (20Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Cell. 2004; 117: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The metabolism of (p)ppGpp is dependent on metal ions where Mg2+ is utilized for the synthesis reaction that involves a pyrophosphate transfer from ATP to GTP/GDP/IMP. Rel proteins are classified along with enzymes such as DNA Polβ that catalyze a similar reaction. Most biochemical studies, supported by crystal structures, suggest a dual metal ion mechanism for DNA Polβ (19Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Pelletier H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 25Steitz T.A. Nature. 1998; 391: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 26Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Three conserved Asp residues at the active site are proposed to coordinate the binding of two Mg2+ ions and ATP at the active site. There is little effect on the polymerase activity of DNA Polβ as Mg2+ is increased (27Black C.B. Cowan J.A. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 3: 292-299Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, reports by Avarbock et al. (17Avarbock D. Avarbock A. Rubin H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11640-11648Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and Mechold et al. (18Mechold U. Murphy H. Brown L. Cashel M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 194: 2878-2888Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar) suggest that a similar mechanism may not prevail in RelMtb and RelSeq as they observe a severe inhibition of pppGpp synthesis at high Mg2+ concentration. Based on these and the lack of a third conserved Asp in the structural comparison of RelSeq and Polβ, Hogg et al. (20Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Cell. 2004; 117: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) proposed a single-cation mechanism for Rel proteins. Here, we distinguish between the bifunctional and monofunctional classes of Rel proteins and show that they utilize Mg2+ differentially for the (p)ppGpp synthesis activity. We associate this difference in metal requirement to a unique charge reversal in a conserved motif of the synthesizing domain. The significance of this charge reversal is revealed in pppGpp synthesis assays using the wild type and mutant RelMtb and RelE. coli (Fig. 3C), which clearly suggests that the presence of RXKD/EXDD motif determines this differential effect. The inhibition due to Mg2+ is restricted only to proteins containing an RXKD motif. Furthermore, fluorescence studies revealed the influence of RXKD/EXDD motifs in determining nucleotide binding in the presence of Mg2+. Firstly, both GTP and ATP binding are Mg2+-independent for proteins having an RXKD motif since WT-RelMtb and MT-RelAE. coli bind nucleotides even in Mg2+-depleted (with EDTA) conditions (Fig. 4A, colored blue). Secondly, GTP and ATP binding reduced considerably in WT-RelMtb that carried an RXKD motif as Mg2+ concentration was increased (Fig. 4A, panels 1 and 2). Although this effect was not seen for RelAE. coli (with EXDD), MT-RelAE. coli carrying an RXKD motif showed a clear reversal as nucleotide binding reduced at higher Mg2+ (Fig. 4A, panels 3 and 4). Thus, it is apparent that RXKD-containing proteins do not bind nucleotides at high Mg2+ and therefore explains the lack of pppGpp synthesis seen in Figs. 1A and 3B. Our observation from CD experiments, that RXKD-containing proteins show an increase in helicity (Fig. 5, A and C) with increasing Mg2+, gains prominence due to the fact that a similar loop-to-helix transition of a region, termed catalytic loop, is implicated in Mg2+ binding in the bifunctional RelSeq (20Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Cell. 2004; 117: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In RelSeq, two monomers present in the asymmetric unit display a conformational antagonism, i.e. in one monomer, the synthesis domain is inactive and the hydrolysis domain is active (synthesis-OFF/hydrolysis-ON) and vice versa in the second monomer (synthesis-ON/hydrolysis-OFF). The catalytic loop is unstructured when the synthesis domain is inactive and forms a helical structure when the synthesis domain is active. The importance of this structural transition arises due to the way Mg2+ is proposed to be coordinated. Two conserved residues, Asp-264 of the catalytic loop and Glu-323 from a neighboring β-sheet, coordinate the Mg2+. As this β-sheet is a part of the rigid core that confers stability to the domain, we assume that Mg2+ binding is determined by an appropriately positioned Asp-264 (and Glu-323). This positioning of Asp-264 could be achieved by the structural transition of the catalytic loop to a helix, and hence, could regulate Mg2+ binding. Hogg et al. (20Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Cell. 2004; 117: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) proposed that the catalytic loop undergoes this transition when Mg2+ binds together with ATP. However, for proteins having an RXKD motif, fluorescent nucleotide binding experiments clearly depict that ATP binding is Mg2+ independent (Fig. 4A, colored blue), and the CD experiments reveal that the structural transition, too, is exclusively due to Mg2+ (Fig. 5, A and C). Altogether, it is likely that the structural transition noticed in the CD experiments is largely of the catalytic loop observed in the structure of RelSeq (20Hogg T. Mechold U. Malke H. Cashel M. Hilgenfeld R. Cell. 2004; 117: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The differential effect of Mg2+ on pppGpp synthesis, nucleotide binding, and CD experiments can be rationalized as follows. In the case of RXKD-containing bifunctional proteins, perhaps the loop-to-helix transition of the catalytic loop induced by Mg2+ leads to a closure of the substrate binding pocket such that ATP and GTP are excluded from it, which leads to the lack of (p)ppGpp synthesis. In the case of EXDD-containing proteins, Mg2+ is unable to induce a similar structural change, and hence, does not affect (p)ppGpp synthesis. This may be due to a second Mg2+ binding site coordinated by Glu and Asp of EXDD in the monofunctional proteins, where GTP could be stabilized by this additional Mg2+ ion (see “Results”). Perhaps Mg2+ binding to the second site prevents the structural transition of the catalytic loop at high Mg2+. This difference suggests that unlike bifunctional Rel proteins that follow a single-metal ion-mediated catalysis, monofunctional proteins use an additional metal ion for (p)ppGpp synthesis. However, the second metal ion is dispensable since the mutation of EXDD to RXKD retains synthesis activity in monofunctional RelAE. coli. We thank A. Ravi Kant for help with preparing Figs. 4 and 5 and P. Baral for initial efforts on Rel projects. Our sincere thanks also go to Drs. R. Gokhale, R. P. Roy, R. Gurunath, and J.

For EAAT1, EAAT2, and EAAT3, the anion current is only a small component of the total transporter-associated current amplitude, whereas EAAT4 and EAAT5 transporters mediate predominantly anion currents. We here demonstrate that the distinct current proportions are entirely due to differences in glutamate transport rates. EAAT3 and EAAT4 differ in unitary glutamate transport rates as well as in the voltage and substrate dependence of anion channel opening, but ion conduction properties are very similar. Noise analysis revealed identical unitary current amplitudes and similar absolute open probabilities for the two anion channels. The low glutamate transport rate of EAAT4 allows regulation of cellular excitability without interfering with extracellular glutamate homeostasis and makes this EAAT isoform ideally suited to regulate excitability in dendritic spines of Purkinje neurons.

Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. After the release from glutamatergic nerve terminals, glial and neuronal glutamate transporters remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft to ensure low resting glutamate levels and to prevent neuronal damage by excessive glutamate receptor activation. EAATs 2The abbreviations used are: EAAT, excitatory amino acid transporter; TBOA, l-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate. mediate two different transport processes; they are secondary active glutamate transporters and anion-selective channels (1Fairman W.A. Amara S.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F481-F486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Different EAAT isoforms differ in the relative contribution of anion currents to the total transporter-mediated current (2Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 3Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G.

These differences have been interpreted as an indication that some EAATs play physiological roles as glutamate transporters and others play roles as glutamate-gated anion channels involved in the regulation of cellular excitability. To obtain a better understanding of the functional basis of these differences, we compared the functional properties of two neuronal EAAT isoforms, EAAT3 and EAAT4. EAAT3 displays only modest anion currents in heterologous expression systems (2Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), whereas EAAT4 anion currents greatly exceed electrogenic transport currents (3Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the unitary current amplitudes and the absolute open probabilities of EAAT3 and EAAT4 are very similar. EAAT3 and EAAT4 anion channels differ in anion channel gating and glutamate dependence of the anion channel activation, two features that might be explained by a variable interaction between individual subunits of the multimeric transporter protein. Heterologous Expression and Functional Characterization of EAAT3 and EAAT4—The coding region of hEAAT3 (GenBank™ accession number NP_004161) was excised from pTLN2-hEAAT3 (provided by Dr. Matthias A. Hediger, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland) (6Trotti D. Peng J.B. Dunlop J. Hediger M.A. Brain Res. 2001; 914: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The pcDNA3.1-rEAAT4 construct (GenBank™ accession number NM_114454) was provided by Dr. J. Rothstein (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Point mutations were introduced into the wild type hEAAT3 cDNAs using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For each construct, two independent recombinants from the same transformation were examined and shown to exhibit indistinguishable functional properties. Transient transfection of tsA201 cells were performed as previously described (5Melzer N. Biela A. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In some of the experiments, a stable inducible cell line was used (7Melzer N. Torres-Salazar D. Ch Fahlke Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 19214-19218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), generated by selecting Flp-In-T-Rex cells (Invitrogen) after transfection with pcDNA5-FRT-To-rEAAT4. Capped cRNA was synthesized from MluI-linearized pTLN2-hEAAT3 (6Trotti D. Peng J.B. Dunlop J. Hediger M.A. Brain Res. 2001; 914: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and from NheI-linearized pGEMHE-rEAAT4 (8Torres-Salazar D. Ch Fahlke J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7513-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) templates through use of MESSAGE machine kits (Ambion, Austin, TX). Injection and handling of oocytes were performed as described elsewhere (9Gendreau S. Voswinkel S. Torres-Salazar D. Lang N. Heidtmann H. Detro-Dassen S. Schmalzing G. Hidalgo P. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39505-39512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Oocytes expressing EAAT3 were usually measured 1 day after injection. To account for differences in expression levels, this period was increased to 4–5 days for EAAT4. Electrophysiology—Standard whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) amplifier as described (5Melzer N. Biela A. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Torres-Salazar D. Ch Fahlke J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7513-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were clamped to 0 mV for at least 10 s between test sweeps. In experiments measuring EAAT-associated noise, the pipettes were covered with dental wax to reduce their capacitance. More than 80% of the series resistance was compensated by an analog procedure resulting in calculated voltage errors of <5 mV. Standard solutions contained 140 mm NaSCN (standard NaSCN-based external solution) or NaCl (standard NaCl-based external solution), 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, intracellular 115 mm NaCl (standard NaCl-based internal solution) or NaSCN (standard NaSCN-based external solution), 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. For the concentration dependences of glutamate (see Fig. 5), a given concentration of l-glutamate was added to the external solution. In oocytes, glutamate transporter-associated currents were recorded by two-electrode voltage clamp using a CA1 amplifier (Dagan, Minneapolis, MN). Prior to electrophysiological testing, the oocytes were incubated for at least 5 h in a gluconate-based solution containing 96 mm sodium gluconate, 4 mm potassium gluconate, 0.3 mm calcium gluconate, 1 mm magnesium gluconate, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Voltage clamp experiments were started in a gluconate-based external solution. The oocytes were held at 0 mV, and the currents elicited by 100-ms voltage steps between –120 mV and +80 mV were filtered at 2 kHz (–3 dB) and digitalized with a sampling rate of 10 kHz using a Digidata AD/DA converter (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Glutamate uptake currents were measured by 100-subtracting current amplitudes in a gluconate-based glutamate-free solution from values in an external solution supplemented with 500 μm l-glutamate. Anion currents were determined after exchanging the external solution to 96 mm NaSCN, 4 mm KCl, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, in the absence or in the presence of 500 μm external glutamate without any current subtraction procedure. Data Analysis—The data were analyzed with a combination of the pClamp9 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) programs. Current amplitudes were used without applying a subtraction procedure. Current-voltage relationships at various substrate concentrations were constructed by plotting isochronal current amplitudes determined 1 ms after the voltage step versus the membrane potential. Voltage dependences of the relative open probability (see Figs. 1 and 2) were determined by plotting the normalized isochronal current amplitude at +135 or –135 mV after 0.2 s prepulses to different voltages versus the preceding potential. Activation curves obtained in this manner were then fit with a single Boltzmann term plus a voltage-independent value (I(V) = Amp/(1 + e(V – V0.5)/kV) + Pmin) (supplemental Table S1). Permeability ratios were calculated from reversal potential measurements using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation (10Hodgkin A.L. Katz B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1949; 108: 37-77Crossref Scopus (1821) Google Scholar) as described elsewhere (5Melzer N. Biela A. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1). Isochronal anion current amplitudes were measured at various concentrations at a given test potential to obtain the concentration dependence of anion channel activation by glutamate. The substrate dependences thus obtained were normalized to the maximum current amplitude, averaged after normalization, and fit with the Hill equation.FIGURE 2Voltage and substrate dependence of EAAT3- and EAAT4-associated anion currents in cells dialyzed with Cl–-based solutions.

For each membrane potential, apparent dissociation constants (KD values) were determined on several cells and averaged. The Student's t test was used for statistical evaluation. For comparisons between EAAT3 and EAAT4, cells and oocytes with comparable anion current amplitudes were used. Noise Analysis—Current variances (σ2ss) and mean current amplitudes (Iss) were determined during the last 50 ms of 500-ms test steps to voltages between –155 mV and +105 mV. Changing the amount of data subjected to analysis (from 10 to 70 ms) did not significantly alter the variance. Current traces were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered using a Bessel low pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 1 kHz. For all experiments, the analysis was repeated after digital filtering with a Butterworth filter at 0.5 kHz, yielding similar results. The variance at the current reversal potential was subtracted as background noise. Power spectra, S(f), were determined from current recordings upon voltage steps to –155 mV. Current traces were sampled at 50 kHz and filtered using a Bessel low pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 10 kHz. For each power spectrum, 30 traces were averaged, and the mean values were subtracted from individual recordings. Power spectra were computed from subtracted traces using the fast Fourier transform routine in Clampfit 9. The resulting spectra were averaged, and the power spectrum determined at the current reversal potential (see Fig. 3, F and G) was subtracted. The resulting power spectra could be well fit with the sum of two Lorentzian components. S(f)=S(0)1+(ffc0)2+S(1)1+(ffc1)2(Eq. 2) Lorentzian noise depends on the number of channels (N), the unitary current amplitude (i), and the absolute open probability (p), σ2=Ni2p(1-p)+σ02(Eq. 3) with σ2o being the background noise. Dividing the variance (σ2ss) by the mean current amplitude (Iss = Npi), after subtraction of the background noise, results as follows. σss2-σ02lss=i(1-p)(Eq. 4) To determine the unitary current amplitudes and the absolute open probabilities of EAAT3 and EAAT4, we employed a variation of stationary variance analysis (11Sesti F. Goldstein S.A.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Sigworth F.J. Zhou J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 746-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). EAAT3 and EAAT4 anion channels display a voltage-dependent rectification of the unitary current amplitude (see Fig. 1). To account for this voltage-dependent conductance, the instantaneous current amplitude was measured by extrapolating the current amplitude back to the moment of the voltage jump; this extrapolation was done by fitting a biexponential function to the time dependence of the current relaxation. The instantaneous current is proportional to the unitary current amplitude (Iinst = const*i) so that dividing both sides of the equation by the instantaneous current amplitude results as follows. σss2-σ02lss=i(1-p)=i-lssN(Eq. 5) σss2-σ02IssIinst=iIinst-IssIinstN=1const-IssIinstN(Eq. 6) Plotting the variance divided by the product of the mean and the instantaneous current amplitudes ((σ2 – σ2o)/IssIinst) versus the ratio of the mean current amplitude by the instantaneous current amplitude (Iss/Iinst) results in a linear relationship (see Fig. 4, A and D). Multiplication of the y axis intercept (1/const) of the fitted straight with instantaneous current amplitudes provides the unitary current amplitudes, whereas the slope, –1/N, gives the number of channels. This analysis was only possible in the presence of glutamate, because the open probability changed only a little with voltage in the absence of glutamate (see Figs. 1 and 2). We therefore measured first the number of channels in the presence of glutamate and used this value to obtain the unitary current amplitude from the current variance and the mean steady-state current amplitude measured at the same cells without glutamate. i=σ2-σ02Iststate+IststateN(Eq. 7) Voltage-dependent Gating of EAAT3- and EAAT4-associated Anion Currents—We expressed hEAAT3 and rEAAT4 glutamate transporters heterologously in tsA201 cells and measured currents through whole cell patch clamp experiments. Electrogenic glutamate uptake was abolished by dialyzing cells with a K+ free internal solution (8Torres-Salazar D. Ch Fahlke J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7513-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Using Cl– or NO–3 as main permeant anions, EAAT3-associated anion currents were quite small, and we therefore used SCN– (2Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 5Melzer N. Biela A. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as the main anion on one membrane side and Cl– on the other. Under these conditions, whole cell currents in cells expressing EAAT3 and EAAT4 were significantly larger than those in untransfected tsA201 cells, in the absence as well as in the presence of glutamate (Figs. 1 and 2). Complete substitution of anions with gluconate– resulted in negligible current amplitudes (at +165 mV, 0.2 ± 0.04 nA (n = 5) after substitution of internal and external anions with gluconate in the presence of 500 μm l-glutamate). Moreover, application of 200 μm l-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate (TBOA) (13Shimamoto K. Lebrun B. Yasuda-Kamatani Y. Sakaitani M. Shigeri Y. Yumoto N. Nakajima T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) reduced the current amplitudes to values close to background levels (Fig. 1). These results demonstrate that, under our experimental conditions, EAAT3 and EAAT4 whole cell currents predominantly represent transporter-associated anion currents (5Melzer N. Biela A. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Melzer N. Torres-Salazar D. Ch Fahlke Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 19214-19218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Torres-Salazar D. Ch Fahlke J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7513-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both transporter isoforms conduct anions in the absence of glutamate. Application of glutamate increases the amplitudes and changes the time and voltage dependence of anion currents (Figs. 1 and 2). With SCN– on the internal membrane side, glutamate augments EAAT3 and EAAT4 anion current amplitudes to a similar extent (Fig. 1, B and E). With the anion distribution reversed, increases of glutamate-induced current amplitudes were much smaller for EAAT3 than for EAAT4 (Fig. 2, B and E). EAAT anion channels exhibit time- and voltage-dependent current relaxations upon voltage steps. Under all of the tested conditions, the anion currents of both the EAAT3 and EAAT4 isoforms rise instantaneously upon voltage steps to negative and positive potentials (Figs. 1 and 2). With SCN– being the main internal anion, hyperpolarizing voltage steps elicit time- and voltage-dependent current decays of EAAT3 and EAAT4 anion currents. This time-dependent decay was more pronounced in the presence than in the absence of glutamate (Fig. 1, A and D). Gating of EAAT anion channels is modified by permeant anions (5Melzer N. Biela A. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Torres-Salazar D. Ch Fahlke J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7513-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The gating of EAAT3 and EAAT4 anion channels is completely different when studied with external SCN– and internal Cl– (Fig. 2, A and D) than at the inverted anion distribution. At Clint/SCNext, there is a fast time-dependent and voltage-dependent deactivation of EAAT4 currents at positive voltages, whereas EAAT3 shows a depolarization-induced activation in the absence or presence of glutamate. The depolarization-induced relative current increase of EAAT3 was augmented by glutamate, whereas current deactivation of EAAT4 was less pronounced in the presence of glutamate than in its absence. Voltage dependences of relative open probabilities were determined by plotting normalized isochronal current amplitudes at a fixed test step versus the preceding potential (Figs. 1, C and F, and 2, C and F). These activation curves can be described well by Boltzmann functions for both isoforms and both ionic conditions (supplemental Table S1). The activation curves of EAAT3 and EAAT4 are similar for SCNint/Clext, but there are prominent isoform-specific gating differences at the reverse anion distribution. Permeation Properties of EAAT3 and EAAT4 Anion Channels—For both isoforms, currents are inwardly rectifying in cells internally dialyzed with the more permeant anion SCN– but outwardly rectifying with SCN– in the external membrane site (Figs. 1 and 2). Reversal potentials enable a calculation of the relative permeabilities using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. In the absence of glutamate, the SCN– over Cl– permeability coefficients are identical for EAAT3 and EAAT4. Application of glutamate changes the anion selectivity of EAAT anion channels (5Melzer N. Biela A. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It causes an increased relative permeability of internal SCN– for EAAT3 and for EAAT4. However, for external SCN–, glutamate results in a decreased PSCN/PCl (p < 0.05) of EAAT4 but leaves the reversal potential of EAAT3 currents unaffected (supplemental Fig. S1). To study unitary anion channel properties, we performed noise analysis (Figs. 3 and 4). Current variances are much larger in cells expressing EAAT3 or EAAT4 (Fig. 3, B–E) than in untransfected or uninduced cells (Fig. 3A). Various EAAT anion channels have been recently reported to generate a Lorentzian type of noise (5Melzer N. Biela A. Ch Fahlke J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50112-50119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Melzer N. Torres-Salazar D. Ch Fahlke Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 19214-19218Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Larsson H.P. Picaud S.A. Werblin F.S. Lecar H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 733-742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Palmer M.J. Taschenberger H. Hull C. Tremere L. von Gersdorff H. J Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4831-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the measured current variance in cells expressing EAAT3 or EAAT4 indeed originates from the opening and closing of individual channels, we computed power spectra from macroscopic currents using fast Fourier transformation. Fig. 3 (F and G) shows representative power spectra of EAAT3 and EAAT4 currents that could be well fit with a sum of two Lorentzian components, with cut-off frequencies comparable with those expected from the relaxation time constants (Fig. 3, F and G). We conclude that the measured current variance is Lorentzian noise associated with gating of EAAT-associated channels. Mean current amplitudes (I) and current variances (σ2) were determined in the last 50 ms of 500-ms test steps to various voltages (Fig. 3, B–E). Current variance was analyzed in two ways. First, the ratio of current variance by mean current amplitude was calculated for both anion conditions and in the presence and absence of glutamate. For channel-mediated currents, this ratio is equal to the product of the single channel amplitude (i) and the fraction of time spent in a closed state (1 – p, with p being the absolute open probability) (σ2/I = i(1 – p) (17Alvarez O. Gonzalez C. Latorre R. Semin. Physiol. Education. 2002; 26: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). EAAT3 and EAAT4 did not differ in this value (for SCNint/Clext at –135 mV, 40.5 ± 16 fA for EAAT3, n = 3; and 49.8 ± 11 fA for EAAT4, n = 4, p = 0.6; for Clint/SCNext at + 65 mV, 4.0 ± 0.8 fA for EAAT3, n = 6; and 4.6 ± 0.8 fA for EAAT4 n = 4, p = 0.1). The identity of these values, however, does not prove that single channel amplitudes and absolute open probabilities are the same for both isoforms. It is still possible that smaller unitary conductances of EAAT3 might be masked by smaller absolute open probabilities. To separate unitary current amplitudes and absolute open probabilities, we performed a variant of stationary noise analysis (11Sesti F. Goldstein S.A.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 651-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 12Sigworth F.J. Zhou J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 746-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Stationary current variances and mean current amplitudes were measured at various voltages, and variances divided by the product of the mean and the instantaneous current amplitudes were plotted against the ratio of the mean current amplitude by the instantaneous current amplitude (Fig. 4, A and D). This transformation of variance-current plots usually used in nonstationary noise analysis (18Sigworth F.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1980; 307: 97-129Crossref Scopus (542) Google Scholar) allows determination of unitary channel properties by a linear fit to values obtained from measurements of stationary noise. The slope (–1/N) of the fitted straight gives the number of channels (N), and the y axis intercept providing the ratio between unitary current amplitude and instantaneous current amplitude. We performed such an analysis only at SCNint/Clext in the presence of glutamate. At all other tested conditions, the open probabilities changed only a little with voltage, precluding a successful analysis. Multiplication of the y axis intercept and the voltage dependence of the instantaneous current provides the voltage dependence of the single channel current amplitudes (Fig. 4, B and E). We obtained comparable results for several cells with varying current amplitudes, indicating that contaminations of the anion current with background currents did not affect the determination of the single channel amplitude. This analysis also allowed determination of absolute open probabilities. The x axis intercept defines the value of Iss/Iinst that corresponds to an absolute open probability of 1. Dividing Iss/Iinst at a given voltage by the x axis intercept gives the absolute open probability. Using this method, we determined the absolute open probabilities at –155 mV and normalized the voltage dependences of relative open probabilities to this value (Fig. 4, C and F). Noise analysis at the same cells after moving to a glutamate-free external solution provides the unitary current amplitude and absolute open probability also under those conditions (Fig. 4, B, C, E, and F). For both isoforms, the single channel current amplitudes are identical in the absence as well as in the presence of glutamate. The sole basis for the glutamate-induced increase of macroscopic current amplitudes is a change of the absolute open probability. We conclude that EAAT3 and EAAT4 anion channels differ neither in the unitary current amplitude nor in the absolute open probability in the absence as well as in the presence of glutamate. EAAT4 Glutamate Transport Rates Are Significantly Smaller than Those of EAAT3—The identity of anion transport rates of EAAT3 and EAAT4 indicates that the well established difference in the contribution of anion current to the total transport current of the two isoforms (2Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 3Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar) must be due to different glutamate transport rates. The use of Xenopus oocytes provides a simple and direct procedure to determine relative glutamate transport rates (Fig. 5). The oocytes were incubated in gluconate-based solution, the removal of permeant anions (15Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. J Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from the external membrane side results in an almost complete efflux of intracellular Cl– anions. Under this condition, glutamate-induced currents represent isolated glutamate uptake currents (Fig. 5A). Consequently, the external solution was switched from a gluconate-based to an SCN–-based solution (Fig. 5C). Because of the voltage dependence of the electrogenic glutamate transport (19Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 20Levy L.M. Warr O. Attwell D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9620-9628Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), currents at positive potentials are isolated anion currents. The specificity of anion currents was tightly monitored by testing their TBOA sensitivity (Fig. 5E). EAAT3 expresses much better in Xenopus oocytes than EAAT4. We adjusted the length of the time period between injection and experiments so that oocytes expressing EAAT3 or EAAT4 exhibited comparable absolute current amplitudes. The amplitudes of uptake currents were 234 ± 37 nA for EAAT3 (n = 5) and only 86 ± 17 nA (n = 5) for EAAT4-expressing oocytes at –120 mV (Fig. 5, A and B). At +60 mV, anion current amplitudes measured 0.8 ± 0.05 μA in the absence of glutamate and 1.8 ± 0.2 μA in the presence of glutamate for EAAT3 (n = 5) and 2.2 ± 0.09 μA in the absence and 4.1 ± 0.1 μA in the presence of glutamate for EAAT4 (n = 5) (Fig. 5, C and D). These two values were used to calculate the uptake current to anion current ratio (0.13 ± 0.01 (n = 9) for EAAT3 and 0.02 ± 0.001 (n = 4) for"

Ten DGK isoforms, grouped into five subtypes, are found in higher organisms. All contain a conserved C-terminal domain and at least two cysteine-rich motifs of unknown function. DGKα is a type I enzyme that acts as a negative modulator of diacylglycerol-based signals during T cell activation. Here we studied the functional role of the DGKα domains using mutational analysis to investigate membrane binding in intact cells. We show that the two atypical C1 domains are essential for plasma membrane targeting of the protein in intact cells but unnecessary for catalytic activity. We also identify the C-terminal sequence of the protein as essential for membrane binding in a phosphatidic acid-dependent manner. Finally we demonstrate that, in the absence of the calcium binding domain, receptor-dependent translocation of the truncated protein is regulated by phosphorylation of Tyr335. This functional study provides new insight into the role of the so-called conserved domains of this lipid kinase family and demonstrates the existence of additional domains that confer specific plasma membrane localization to this particular isoform.

The transient generation of lipids at the cell membrane by the concerted action of lipases, kinases, and phosphatases is a very effective mechanism for the localization and activation of signaling molecules. The majority of lipid-modifying enzymes are cytosolic proteins that must in turn translocate to the membrane to modify their substrates. Characterization of the mechanism that governs membrane translocation of these proteins is, thus, essential to assess precisely their role in the regulation of cell responses.The diacylglycerol kinases (DGK) 5The abbreviations used are: DGK, diacylglycerol kinase; DAG, diacylglycerol; PA, phosphatidic acid; TCR, T cell receptor; KD, kinase-dead; GFP, green fluorescent protein; C1, protein kinase C conserved domain type 1; PS, phosphatidylserine; wt, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 5The abbreviations used are: DGK, diacylglycerol kinase; DAG, diacylglycerol; PA, phosphatidic acid; TCR, T cell receptor; KD, kinase-dead; GFP, green fluorescent protein; C1, protein kinase C conserved domain type 1; PS, phosphatidylserine; wt, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. are a family of enzymes that phosphorylate diacylglycerol (DAG) to produce phosphatidic acid (PA); this modulates the levels of these two lipids, both of which have recognized second messenger functions. Early experiments showed that DGK activity occupies a central position in phospholipid synthesis; this enzyme attracted additional interest when it was shown to participate in intracellular signaling (1Topham M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 97: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). DGK activity is found in organisms from bacteria to mammals, although the protein identified as a DGK in bacteria is an integral membrane protein (2Sanders C.R. Czerski L. Vinogradova O. Badola P. Song D. Smith S.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8610-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and has little structural homology with the DGK characterized in multicellular organisms (3Wattenberg B. Pitson S. Raben D. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1128-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Ten DGK isoforms have been identified in mammals and grouped into five subtypes based on the presence of various domains in their primary sequences, which define distinct regulatory motifs.Translocation from one subcellular compartment to another appears to be a general theme in the regulation of DGK proteins. Many of the early data regarding DGK activity regulation refer to changes in DGK activity or localization based on enzymatic studies without specifying the isoform concerned (4Besterman J.M. Pollenz R.S. Booker E.L.J. Cuatrecasas P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9378-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Maroney A.C. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2537-2544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of the DGK isoforms has broadened the concept that these proteins regulate their actions by translocating from one cell compartment to another and by forming part of different protein complexes (6Los A. de Widt J. Topham M.K. van Blitterswijk W.J. Divecha N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7Nelson C. Perry S.J. Regier D.S. Prescott S.M. Topham M.K.

The non-conserved regulatory domains appear to govern subtype-specific DGK translocation. The characterization of these domains has allowed an initial outline of the signaling pathways responsible for the subcellular relocalization of the various DGK isoforms (9Santos T. Carrasco S. Jones D.R. Merida I. Eguinoa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30300-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Topham M.K. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 24760-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).In addition to their distinct regulatory motifs, all DGK family members have a conserved catalytic domain, proposed to harbor the ATP-binding site. Precise characterization of the DGKα ATP-binding site has remained elusive; all DGK have a conserved GGDGXXG motif that is essential for activity that is hypothesized to fulfill this function (14Goto K. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11196-11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Members of this lipid kinase family share another conserved structure, a cysteine-rich motif (CRM), present at least twice in all DGK. The homology of DGK CRM domains to the phorbol ester/DAG binding, C1-type motifs of protein kinase C originally led to the idea that these motifs were responsible for DAG binding in DGK. Sequence analysis nonetheless indicates that, with the exception of the first C1 domains in DGKβ and DGKγ, the DGK C1 domains lack the key residues that define this motif as a canonical C1-like, phorbol ester binding domain (15Hurley J. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The participation of the conserved C1 domains in DGK enzyme activity, thus, remains a matter of debate. Some studies suggest that these conserved motifs are required (16Houssa B. de Widt J. Kranenburg O. Moolenar W.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6820-6822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), whereas others found them dispensable for DAG phosphorylation (17Sakane F. Masahiro K. Wada I. Imai S. Kanoh H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).DGKα is a type I DGK expressed abundantly in the cytosol of T lymphocytes that translocates to the membrane during T cell activation (18Sanjuan M.A. Pradet-Balade B. Jones D.R. Martinez A.C. Stone J.C. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Mérida I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2877-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). DGKα acts as a negative modulator of the signals that determine T lymphocyte activation (8Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Mérida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). T cells from DGKα-deficient mice have enhanced responses (19Olenchock B. Guo R. Carpenter J.H. Jordan M. Topham M.K. Koretzky G.A. Zhong X.P. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1174-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), further confirming the relevance of this enzyme in regulating immune function. Structural-functional analyses showed that the regulatory N-terminal domain of the enzyme, containing a recoverin-like domain and a tandem of EF hand motifs, acts as a negative regulator of enzyme activation and receptor-induced membrane translocation (8Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Mérida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Jiang Y. Qian W. Haves J.H. Walsh J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34092-34099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Translocation of wild type (wt) DGKα is a very rapid and transient event, whereas a catalytically inactive mutant form remains at the membrane for a longer period of time (18Sanjuan M.A. Pradet-Balade B. Jones D.R. Martinez A.C. Stone J.C. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Mérida I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2877-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This suggests feedback regulation based on PA generation, which guarantees transient DGKα localization at the membrane. Deletion of the DGKα N-terminal domain does not alter enzyme activity but results in constitutive localization of the enzyme at the plasma membrane in intact T cells. This suggests that the Ca2+ regulatory domain, characteristic of type I enzymes, is responsible for this PA negative feedback.Studies in primary T cells and T cell lines demonstrate that DGKα translocates to the plasma membrane after stimulation of endogenous T cell receptor (TCR) and/or ectopically expressed muscarinic type I receptor (8Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Mérida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Sanjuan M.A. Pradet-Balade B. Jones D.R. Martinez A.C. Stone J.C. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Mérida I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2877-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Analysis of other cell types also suggests that the plasma membrane is the main site of DGKα activity (13Schirai Y. Segawa S. Kuriyama M. Goto K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24760-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 21Fukunaga-Takenaka R. Shirai Y. Yagi K. Adachi N. Sakai N. Merino E. Mérida I. Saito N. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is still not known, however, how DGKα is targeted specifically to this subcellular compartment. We used the DGKα construct that lacks the Ca2+ regulatory domain to further analyze the structural determinants responsible for its constitutive localization at the plasma membrane. Using mutational analysis and studies in intact cells, we show that the two DGKα C1 domains, although not necessary for catalytic activity, are critical for plasma membrane targeting. We identify the sequence C-terminal to a conserved Pro-rich region also necessary for membrane binding through a still unidentified mechanism. Finally, we confirm that Tyr335 phosphorylation is an absolute requirement for DGKα membrane localization in a receptor-dependent manner. With this study, we complete a detailed mapping of the diverse DGKα motifs and provide new insight into the functional role of the domains conserved in most members of this lipid kinase family.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The J-HM1-2.2 cell line was generated by stable transfection of the human muscarinic subtype-1 receptor in the Jurkat T cell line (22Desai D.M. Newton M.E. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 348: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). J-HM1-2.2 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen); COS-7 and Jurkat cells were purchased from the ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker). All media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen).Plasmids and Transfection—A cDNA fragment encoding mouse DGKα was subcloned into the EcoRI site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA 3.1 containing a 5′-hemagglutinin tag in the molecular cloning site (a kind gift of Dr. A. Zaballos, Centro Nacional de BiotecnologÁa, Madrid, Spain). The GFP-DGKα and GFP-DGKaΔEF constructs have been described (8Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Mérida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). GFP-DGKaΔEFKD (kinase-dead) and GFP-DGKaΔEFKDY335F were generated by direct mutagenesis of Gly433 to Ala (KD) or Tyr335 to Phe (Y335F) using GFP-DGKaΔEF as a template. GFP-DGKaΔCT mutants were generated by generating specific DNA restriction sites.T lymphocytes in logarithmic growth were transfected with 25 μg of plasmid DNA by electroporation (270 V/950 microfarads). COS-7 cells (80-90% confluence) were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. All experiments were performed 36-48 h after transfection.DGK Assay—Transfected cells were frozen on dry ice and lysed by sonication in DGK assay buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.25 m saccharose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and aprotinin). Cell lysates were centrifuged (20,000 × g), and the supernatant was used for the DGK reaction as described (23Flores I. Casaseca T. Martinez-A C. Kanoh H. Mérida I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10334-10340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Protein (20 μg) from whole lysates or immunoprecipitates of tagged proteins was used as enzyme source. Standard phosphorylation assays were performed (10 min, 37 °C; final volume, 50 μl). The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of 1 m HCl, and lipids were extracted with 20 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1, v/v). Organic layers were recovered, dried, dissolved in 20 μl of CHCl3, and applied to silica gel TLC plates with dioleoyl-PA as a standard. Plates were developed with a CHCl3, MeOH, 4 m NH4OH solvent system (9:7:2, v/v/v). Dried plates were autoradiographed, and bands corresponding to PA were quantified by autoradiogram scanning.Fractionation Studies—T lymphocytes were harvested, washed in PBS, resuspended in TES buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m succors) with protein inhibitors, and lysed by 10 passages of the cell suspension through a 25-gauge needle. Nuclei were removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h), and pellets were resuspended in TES buffer supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40. Supernatant and pellets were resolved in SDS-PAGE and analyzed in Western blot with the indicated antibodies.Western Blot—To determine expression of transfected proteins, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin) for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Electrophoresed samples were transferred to nitrocellulose, and protein expression was analyzed using the indicated antibodies and ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody was from Covance, anti-GFP monoclonal antibody was from Roche Applied Science, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG from Dako.Analysis of CD69 Cell Surface Expression—Transfected cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies. CD69 expression on the cell surface was analyzed 6 h after stimulation gating for GFP-positive cells) using a phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-human CD69 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen). Immunofluorescence intensity of the cells was determined by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—T cells were harvested 36 h after electroporation with plasmids, washed, and allowed to attach to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (1 h, room temperature). In the case of TCR stimulation, Jurkat cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, washed once, and resuspended in HEPES-balanced solution. Cells were transferred to chambered coverslips coated with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibody (final concentration 5 μg/ml, 4 °C, overnight). All subsequent incubations and washes used a 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS buffer; antibodies were incubated (37 °C, 1 h) in a humidified chamber. Nuclei were labeled with Topro-3 (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence was analyzed on a Leica confocal microscope (TCS-NT) with the associated software. For inhibitor treatment, the DGK inhibitor R59949 (10 μm; Calbiochem) was added after the first frame, and images were recorded every 11 s.Stimulation with Antibody-coated Microspheres—Antibodies were adsorbed to microspheres by mixing 1 μg of antibody (1:1 CD3:CD28) in PBS with 0.5 × 106 microspheres in a final volume of 1 ml and incubated (1.5 h at room temperature) with continuous mixing; 1.5 ml of 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS was added, and mixing was continued (30 min). Microspheres were washed three times with PBS and suspended in PBS for the addition to cells. For stimulation, cells were mixed with antibody-coated microspheres at a 2:1 cell/bead proportion and plated on poly-dl-lysine-coated chamber slides. Images were captured each 15 s by confocal microscopy and processed using ImageJ software.RESULTSIdentification of the DGKα Minimal Catalytic Core—DGKα has a highly conserved catalytic domain and a variable N-terminal domain shown to exert a negative regulatory role for enzyme activity and subcellular localization. The exact identity of the “minimal catalytic domain” needed to phosphorylate DAG nonetheless remains unclear. To study enzymatic activity of the catalytic domain, we engineered a protein lacking the regulatory N terminus and both C1 domains (Δ327DGKα) (Fig. 1A). Expression of the truncated protein was confirmed by Western blot, and enzymatic activity was determined in cell lysates and immunoprecipitates of transfected COS cells (Fig. 1B). The expression level of this construct was reproducibly much lower than that of the wt enzyme (Fig. 1B). However, enzymatic assay on immunopellets revealed that the DGKαΔ 327 mutant retains significant activity, confirming that the C1 domains are not directly related to the catalytic activity.C1 Domains Are Essential for DGKα Membrane Targeting—In addition to the C-terminal conserved domain, all DGK family members have at least two C1 domains, which belong to the general HX10-12CX2CX12-14CX2CX4HX2CX5-7C motif found in more than 200 distinct signaling proteins (15Hurley J. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Structural analysis showed that in addition to Cys and His, other residues are required for phorbol ester and DAG binding (24Zhang G. Kazanietz M. Blumberg P. Hurley J. Cell. 1995; 81: 917-924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Based on the presence of these additional residues, C1 domains can be classified as typical or atypical (25Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis indicated that, with the exception of the first C1 domains in DGKβ and DGKγ, DGK C1 domains lack one, two, or all three residues (Pro, Gly, and Gln) that define a C1 as a typical phorbol ester binding (and probably DAG binding) domain (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2DGKα CRM (C1) domains are essential for membrane targeting. A, alignment of the C1 domains of DGK family members with C1 from other proteins. Human protein sequences were used for the alignment, except for mouse DGKα, rat DGKβ,-γ, and -ζ, and hamster DGKη. Proteins expressing typical phorbol dibutyrate binding C1 domains are grouped at the bottom. The conserved Cys and His, which are requisites for the canonical C1, are highlighted in blue. The three residues required for phorbol dibutyrate binding (Pro, Gly, and Gln) are indicated in brown. Mutated His and Trp in the DGKα C1 A and C1 B motifs are in red, and conserved Trp in DGK and the corresponding Phe in the remaining proteins are in green. B, GFP-DGKα constructs with the indicated C1 mutations were transfected into J-HM1-2.2 cells. Subcellular localization was assessed by confocal microscopy before (top row) and 2 min after carbachol stimulation (middle row). Truncated GFP-DGKαΔEF constructs bearing the same mutations were transfected, and plasma membrane localization were assayed by confocal microscopy (bottom row). Images are representative of the field observed for each mutant in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To study the role of C1 domains in DGKα cell membrane localization, we used a Jurkat T cell line variant in which TCR-like responses, including DGKα translocation, are triggered by carbachol stimulation of an ectopically expressed muscarinic type I receptor (8Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Mérida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Jones D.R. Sanjuán M.A. Stone J.C. Mérida I. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We engineered point mutations of the conserved His in the first and the second C1 in the full-length GFP-DGKα sequence. Membrane translocation was then examined by confocal microscopy after carbachol stimulation of the cells. Mutation of the conserved His residues in either C1 prevented protein translocation in response to receptor stimulation (Fig. 2B). Alignment of DGK C1 sequences showed a conserved Trp after the first His, with the exception of the first and second C1 of DGKθ, which had the Phe generally found in C1 domains in other proteins (Fig. 2A). Because the Trp after the first His appears to be characteristic of DGK, we analyzed the role of this residue in DGKα. A conservative mutation of this Trp to Phe did not alter receptor-regulated translocation. Mutation to a non-conservative Gly abolished enzyme translocation after receptor stimulation, indicating the need for an aromatic residue (Fig. 2B). These results point to the DGKα C1 region as essential for membrane localization of the protein through lipid and/or protein interactions.Deletion of the N-terminal Ca2+ binding domain results in a protein (GFP-DGKαΔEF) constitutively located at the plasma membrane when expressed in Jurkat cells (8Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Mérida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We next analyzed whether the C1 domains were also required for constitutive membrane localization of this mutant. As for the wt protein, mutation of Trp to Phe had no effect on enzyme localization, whereas mutation to Gly induced complete protein dissociation from the membrane (Fig. 2B, bottom). These results concur with those described for the full-length construct and show that failure of the enzyme to translocate after receptor stimulation was not due to a delay in translocation kinetics. Finally, a construct expressing the C1 domains alone fused to enhanced GFP did not localize to the plasma membrane (not shown), suggesting that this region, although necessary, is not sufficient for DGKα plasma membrane localization.The previous experiments suggest that the C1 region, whereas necessary, is not sufficient for plasma membrane localization. We next decided to perform additional mutations/truncation on the GFP-DGKαΔEF mutant to investigate the nature of the requirements for its constitutive membrane localization. A summary of the different mutants used in the next experiments is shown in Fig. 3.FIGURE 3The schematic represents the construct used along this study. The localization of the conserved GGDG region, the Tyr335 residue, and the C-terminal domain are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Deletion of the DGKα C-terminal Region Prevents Constitutive Membrane Association of GFP-DGKαΔEF—Functional studies with the DGKβ isoform have identified an alternative spliced isoform that lacks the last 35 amino acids. Deletion of this C-terminal region greatly alters plasma membrane localization of this isoform in vivo (27Caricasole A. Bettini E. Sala C. Roncarati R. Kobayashi N. Caldara F. Goto K. Terstappen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4790-4796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the C-terminal sequence of type I enzymes indicated conservation of a Pro-rich sequence followed by an amino acid stretch with no obvious conservation among distinct subtypes (Fig. 4A). To analyze the relevance of the C-terminal sequence in DGKα stability at the membrane, we generated a new construct in which the last 13 amino acids of the GFP-DGKαΔEF construct were deleted (GFP-DGKαΔEFΔCT). When expressed in Jurkat T cells, we found that the protein showed the appropriate molecular weight, but DGK activity was much lower than that detected for GFP-DGKαΔEF when assayed in vitro (Fig. 4B). Confocal analysis in intact cells established that deletion of the C-terminal sequence disrupted constitutive membrane localization of the GFP-DGKαΔEF construct at the membrane (Fig. 4C). This suggests that, as previously shown for DGKβ, this region might represent an important site for membrane interaction. Fractionation analysis confirmed that deletion of the C-terminal domain affects cytosol/membrane distribution (Fig. 4D).FIGURE 4C-terminal domain is essential for membrane targeting of the GFP-DGKαΔEF mutant. A, alignment of the C-terminal domain of type I DGK, showing conserved Pro residues (shaded). The deleted sequence (amino acids 722-734) in the GFP-DGKαΔCT mutant is underlined. B, the indicated DGKα mutants were transfected into Jurkat T cells, and 24 h after transfection, proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. Enzymatic activity was determined in the immunopellets as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The upper panel shows an autoradiogram of the TLC plate. One-tenth of the sample was analyzed for protein expression by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (WB, lower panel). One representative experiment is shown of three performed with similar results. C, the DGKα mutants were transfected into Jurkat T cells, and plasma membrane localization was assessed by confocal microscopy of live cells. The figure shows single confocal frames. D, transfected Jurkat T cells were lysed, and subcellular fractions were purified as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Cytosol (C) and membrane (M) fractions were analyzed by SDSPAGE, and the presence of protein was assessed with anti-GFP antibodies. Expression of transferrin receptor (TfR) and IκBα was determined as control of the purity of the fraction. E, transfected Jurkat T cells were stimulated with antiCD3/antiCD28 antibodies, and CD69 expression in the GFP-positive population was determined by FACS analysis. Experiments are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have previously demonstrated that the GFP-DGKαΔEF construct acts as a constitutive active DGKα mutant, decreasing the DAG levels generated during stimulation of the TCR. As a result, cells expressing this mutant show decreased membrane expression of the activation marker CD69 in response to TCR triggering (8Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Mérida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To further confirm that deletion of the C terminus affected membrane localization of DGKα and consequently enzyme function, we determined CD69 expression after TCR stimulation in cells expressing GFP-DGKαΔEF or GFP-DGKαΔEFΔCT. As is shown, the attenuation on CD69 expression observed in GFP-DGKαΔEF expressing cells is lost in cells expre"
https://openalex.org/W2023348898,"Background Evolutionary dynamics plays a central role in facilitating the mechanisms of species divergence among pathogenic and saprophytic mycobacteria. The ability of mycobacteria to colonize hosts, to proliferate and to cause diseases has evolved due to its predisposition to various evolutionary forces acting over a period of time. Mycobacterium indicus pranii (MIP), a taxonomically unknown ‘generalist’ mycobacterium, acts as an immunotherapeutic against leprosy and is approved for use as a vaccine against it. The large-scale field trials of this MIP based leprosy vaccine coupled with its demonstrated immunomodulatory and adjuvant property has led to human clinical evaluations of MIP in interventions against HIV-AIDS, psoriasis and bladder cancer. MIP, commercially available as ‘Immuvac’, is currently the focus of advanced phase III clinical trials for its antituberculosis efficacy. Thus a comprehensive analysis of MIP vis-à-vis evolutionary path, underpinning its immanent immunomodulating properties is of the highest desiderata. Principal Findings Genome wide comparisons together with molecular phylogenetic analyses by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP), enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) based genotyping and candidate orthologues sequencing revealed that MIP has been the predecessor of highly pathogenic Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex (MAIC) that did not resort to parasitic adaptation by reductional gene evolution and therefore, preferred a free living life-style. Further analysis suggested a shared aquatic phase of MAIC bacilli with the early pathogenic forms of Mycobacterium, well before the latter diverged as ‘specialists’. Conclusions/Significance This evolutionary paradigm possibly affirms to marshal our understanding about the acquisition and optimization of virulence in mycobacteria and determinants of boundaries therein."
https://openalex.org/W2059306991,"The oscillatory insulin release is fundamental to normal glycemic control. The basis of the oscillation is the intercellular coupling and bursting synchronization of beta cells in each islet. The functional role of islet beta cell mass organization with respect to its oscillatory bursting is not well understood. This is of special interest in view of the recent finding of islet cytoarchitectural differences between human and animal models. In this study we developed a new hexagonal closest packing (HCP) cell cluster model. The model captures more accurately the real islet cell organization than the simple cubic packing (SCP) cluster that is conventionally used. Using our new model we investigated the functional characteristics of beta-cell clusters, including the fraction of cells able to burst f(b), the synchronization index lambda of the bursting beta cells, the bursting period T(b), the plateau fraction p(f), and the amplitude of intracellular calcium oscillation [Ca]. We determined their dependence on cluster architectural parameters including number of cells n(beta), number of inter-beta cell couplings of each beta cell n(c), and the coupling strength g(c). We found that at low values of n(beta), n(c) and g(c), the oscillation regularity improves with their increasing values. This functional gain plateaus around their physiological values in real islets, at n(beta) approximately 100, n(c) approximately 6 and g(c) approximately 200 pS. In addition, normal beta-cell clusters are robust against significant perturbation to their architecture, including the presence of non-beta cells or dead beta cells. In clusters with n(beta)> approximately 100, coordinated beta-cell bursting can be maintained at up to 70% of beta-cell loss, which is consistent with laboratory and clinical findings of islets. Our results suggest that the bursting characteristics of a beta-cell cluster depend quantitatively on its architecture in a non-linear fashion. These findings are important to understand the islet bursting phenomenon and the regulation of insulin secretion, under both physiological and pathological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2086533463,"Amyloid is insoluble aggregated proteins deposited in the extra cellular space. About 25 different proteins are known to form amyloid in vivo and are associated with severe diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, prion diseases and type-2 diabetes. Light chain (AL) -amyloidosis is unique among amyloid diseases in that the fibril protein, a monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain, varies between individuals and that no two AL-proteins with identical primary structures have been described to date. The variability in tissue distribution of amyloid deposits is considerably larger in systemic AL-amyloidosis than in any other form of amyloidosis. The reason for this variation is believed to be based on the differences in properties of the amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain. However, there is presently no known relationship between the structure of an AL-protein and tissue distribution.We compared the pattern of amyloid deposition in four individuals with amyloid protein derived from variable light chain gene O18-O8, the source of a high proportion of amyloidogenic light chains, and in whom all or most of the fibril protein had been determined by amino acid sequencing. In spite of great similarities between the structures of the proteins, there was a pronounced variability in deposition pattern. We also compared the tissue distribution in these four individuals with that of four other patients with AL-amyloid derived from the L2-L16 gene. Although the interindividual variations were pronounced, liver and kidney involvement was much more evident in the latter four.We conclude that although the use of a specific gene influences the tissue distribution of amyloid, each light chain exhibits one or more determinants of organ-specificity, which originate from somatic mutations and post-translational modifications. Eventual identification of such determinants could lead to improved treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis."

The PAF complex interacts with histone-modifying enzymes and RNA polymerase II to regulate transcription. With general transcription regulatory potential in yeast, Hyrax/Cdc73 has been reported to associate with β-catenin to control Wnt/Wg signal-specific transcription in Drosophila. Here, we present the first evidence of IL-6 signal-specific transcriptional regulation by SH2BP1/CTR9 in mammals. Upon LPS injection of mice, we observed transient induction of the mammalian PAF complex in the liver. Inhibition of CTR9 specifically abrogated expression of IL-6-responsive genes, but had no effect on genes constitutively expressed or induced by interferon-β, TNFα, or IL-1β. The PAF complex was found in the promoter regions of IL-6-responsive HP and FGGγ, but not in the promoter region of constitutively active GAPDH. Transcriptional activation by STAT3 was inhibited when CTR9 siRNA was introduced, whereas transcriptional activation was enhanced by mCtr9 overexpression. IL-6-activated Stat3 was found to co-localize and interact with CTR9. In CTR9-depleted cells, decreased STAT3 association with the promoter regions, as well as impaired K4-trimethylation of histone H3 in the coding regions, of target genes was observed. These data suggest that CTR9 participates in the transcription of IL-6-responsive genes through the regulation of DNA association of STAT3 and modification of histone methylation.

Innate immune responses grant the host early protection against infectious agents, resulting in immediate activation of specialized immune cells and production of inflammatory cytokines (1Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3284) Google Scholar). Upon encountering bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 4The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; APR, acute phase response; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin; EST, expressed sequence tag. immune cells become activated and produce cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-6 to mediate inflammatory responses in target organs, such as the liver or vascular endothelium (2Ramadori G. Christ B. Semin. Liver Dis. 1999; 19: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In response to inflammatory signals, the innate immune system provokes an extensive transcriptional deviation from homeostasis, referred to as the acute phase response (APR), which includes global adjustments in metabolism and coordinated regulation of genes for innate defense (3Yoo J.Y. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The yeast PAF complex was originally identified as an RNA polymerase II-associated complex, minimally composed of Paf1p, Cdc73p, Ctr9p, Rtf1p, and Leo1p (4Mueller C.L. Jaehning J.A. Mol.

The PAF complex is associated with a number of transcription-related processes, including transcription initiation and elongation, RNA processing, and modification of histone tails. Components of the yeast PAF complex physically interact with the transcription elongation factors Spt4/Spt5 and FACT, and are associated with the promoter and coding regions of genes being actively transcribed (7Pokholok D.K.

In addition, Paf1p also controls the 3′-end formation of non-polyadenylated RNA transcripts, indicating that the PAF complex has regulatory functions in pre-mRNA processing (9Mueller C.L. Porter S.E.

Interactions between the PAF complex and histone modifying enzymes have been strongly established in yeast by genetic assays. The yeast PAF complex is required to recruit the Set-1 containing COMPASS complex and the Dot1 histone methyltransferase to RNA polymerase II, which results in histone methylation of H3 at lysine residues 4 and 79 (12Krogan N.J. Dover J. Wood A. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K. Ryan O.W. Golshani A. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Mol.

Furthermore, the yeast PAF complex is required for Rad6-Bre1 catalytic activity in mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 123, which provides a signal for histone methylation by COMPASS and Dot1 in the promoter region (12Krogan N.J.

In humans, CDC73 (also known as parafibromin) physically associates with a histone methyltransferase complex that methylates histone H3 on lysine 4, while inhibition of CTR9 reduces cellular levels of histone H3-K4 mono-or dimethylation, and H3-K79 dimethylation (16Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Hughes C.M. Nannepaga S.J. Shanmugam K.S. Copeland T.D. Guszczynski T. Resau J.H. Meyerson M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 17Zhu B. Mandal S.S.

Beyond its role in general transcriptional regulation, the PAF complex has also been suggested to have target gene specificity. The yeast PAF complex controls expression of a subset of genes involved in metabolism and cell cycle regulation (18Betz J.L. Chang M. Washburn T.M. Porter S.E. Mueller C.L. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Genet.

The Arabidopsis orthologs of the PAF complex, Elf7 and Elf8, specifically regulate gene expression of flowering repressors through the enhancement of histone H3 trimethylation at the lysine 4 residue in flowering locus C (FLC) chromatin (22He Y. Doyle M.R. Amasino R.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2774-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, Paf1 and Rtf1 are specifically recruited to active heat shock loci, along with active RNA polymerase II and the elongation factors Spt6 and FACT. Deletion of Paf1 abolishes transcription of the Hsp70 gene and methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4, indicating that Paf1 specifically controls expression of heat shock-inducible genes through the regulation of histone modifications and transcription elongation in the fruit fly (23Adelman K. Wei W. Ardehali M.B. Werner J. Zhu B. Reinberg D. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, hyrax, a Drosophila homolog of yeast Cdc73p, was reported to specifically activate Wnt/Wg target gene transcription mediated by a direct interaction with β-catenin/armadillo (24Mosimann C. Hausmann G. Basler K. Cell. 2006; 125: 327-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In the work presented here, we show that SH2BP1/CTR9, a member of mammalian PAF complex, specifically participates in the transcription of IL-6-inducible inflammatory genes through the regulation of STAT3 association to its target DNA. Plasmids—A full-length cDNA of mouse Ctr9 was obtained in the laboratory of S. D., as described (25Malek S.N. Yang C.H. Earnshaw W.C. Kozak C.A. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6952-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and subsequently subcloned into the pSG5-FLAG mammalian expression vector. Amino acids 679–1173 and 1–679 were deleted to generate the truncated mCtr9 constructs, FLAG-mCtr9deltaC and FLAG-mCtr9deltaN, respectively. Full-length cDNAs of mouse Cdc73 and Paf1 were obtained by RT-PCR from livers of LPS-treated mice and cloned into the pENTR/TOPO or pcDNA3.1/myc mammalian expression plasmids. V5-tagged mCtr9, mCdc73, and mPaf1 were generated using the Gateway recombination system (Invitrogen). HA- or FLAG-tagged mCtr9 and mCdc73 were generated by subcloning into the pSG5 mammalian expression vector. Sequences of all cDNAs were verified by automated sequencing. The human haptoglobin promoter (–1553 to +27) was cloned into the upstream region of the luciferase gene derived from pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell Culture and Transfection—HepG2 cells were maintained in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). For cytokine stimulation, cells were treated with rhIL-6 (10 ng/ml) plus IL-6sR (10 ng/ml), IFN-β1a (100 units/ml), IL-1β (10 ng/ml), or TNFα (10 ng/ml) (all from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Transient transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. An oligonucleotide siRNA targeting CTR9 (5′-AAUGCAUCUCAGUGCUUUG) and a control oligonucleotide siRNA (5′-GAAUUUGCACGAAAACGCC) were synthesized by Qiagen-Xeragon. LPS Treatment—C57BL/6J mice (12 to 15 weeks of age) were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg of LPS (Escherichia coli strain 0111:B4, Difco) in 100 μl of saline, as described (3Yoo J.Y. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). At various times after injection, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Livers were stored in liquid nitrogen until used for RNA extraction. RNA Isolation and Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from livers of LPS-treated mice or HepG2 cells using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). Northern blot analysis was performed on 20 μg of total RNA using random prime-labeled probes. For conventional or real time PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using an oligo-d(T)15 primer and M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). The sequences of the primers for PCR are provided in supplemental Table S1. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed as described (26Szak S.T. Mays D. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, HepG2 cells were treated with formaldehyde (1%) for 30 min. Cells were collected in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm benzamidine), and the chromatin was sonicated three times for 40 s each at setting 5.0 using a Branson 250 Sonicator with a microtip. ChIP was performed by incubating extracts with the appropriate antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After reversal of the cross-links and DNA purification, enriched DNA fragments were analyzed by PCR amplification of the promoter and coding regions of target genes. The sequences of the oligomers for PCR are provided in supplemental Table S2. Antibodies against trimethylated histone H3-K4 and dimethylated histone H3-K9 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and an antibody to STAT3 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Reporter Assay—HepG2, HEK-293, or COS-7 cells in 24-well plates were transfected with m67- or HP-luciferase reporter plasmids (250 ng) together with expression plasmids (250 ng) or siRNA (125 ng). Transfection efficiency was normalized by cotransfection with pRL-TK (2.5 ng). At 36-h post-transfection, cells were treated with IL-6 plus IL-6sR (10 ng/ml each), or OSM (10 ng/ml), for 12 h, and a dual luciferase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Immunoblotting—HepG2 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm benzamidine). Total cell lysates (40 μg per sample) were resolved using SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Antibodies against the FLAG epitope were purchased from Sigma (clone M2), and antibodies against JAK1 and JAK2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Antibodies to STAT3 and pTyr-STAT3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against CTR9 have been previously described (25Malek S.N. Yang C.H. Earnshaw W.C. Kozak C.A. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6952-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Antibodies against PAF1, CDC73, and LEO1 were purchased from Bethyl Laboratory (Montgomery, TX). Immunoreactive signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Immunocytochemistry—HepG2 cells on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips were fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked with 5% horse serum and 2.5% bovine serum albumin for 60 min at room temperature and incubated with rabbit anti-Ctr9 and mouse anti-phospho-STAT3 antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and a rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Slides were mounted with mounting medium containing DAPI (Vectashield) and visualized with a Zeiss inverted epifluorescence microscope (Axioplan 2, Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany). Transcriptional Induction of the Murine PAF Complex in the Mouse Liver by LPS—To understand the molecular mechanisms of global gene regulation during APR, we specifically searched for putative transcriptional regulators induced by inflammatory signals. In our previously reported microarray data performed in C57BL/6J+129/SvJ mice (3Yoo J.Y. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we found that the EST clone Tsbp (GenBank™ accession number AV300608) was significantly induced in the liver by LPS (Fig. 1A). Tsbp is the EST of the previously identified mouse gene Sh2bp1, a nuclear phosphoprotein with multiple tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, which mediate protein-protein interactions (25Malek S.N. Yang C.H. Earnshaw W.C. Kozak C.A. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6952-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Most recently, SH2BP1 was shown to be a human ortholog of yeast Ctr9, a component of the yeast PAF complex (16Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Hughes C.M. Nannepaga S.J. Shanmugam K.S. Copeland T.D. Guszczynski T. Resau J.H. Meyerson M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 17Zhu B. Mandal S.S. Pham A.D. Zheng Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Batra S.K. Tempst P.

Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 5052-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the expression of the murine PAF complex as a function of time after LPS administration. C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with a sublethal dose of LPS (100 μg), and mRNA levels were analyzed by conventional or real-time PCR at various times after injection (Fig. 1B). The transcript levels of murine Ctr9 (mCtr9) were elevated from 3–6 h after LPS stimulation and subsequently declined. The peaks of Ctr9 mRNA accumulation differ between panels A and B, probably due to the genetic differences between C57BL/6 and 129/SvJ strains. We also measured protein levels of CTR9 in LPS stimulated C57BL/6 mice. In agreement with mRNA expression data, increased levels of Ctr9 protein were detected at 12–24 h after LPS treatment in C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 1C). We next measured the transcript levels of other components of the PAF complex by RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). Murine Cdc73 (mCdc73) and Paf1 (mPaf1) mRNAs also increased in the liver in response to LPS treatment, but their expression patterns differed from that of mCtr9. SH2BP1/CTR9 Regulates Transcript Levels of IL-6-inducible APP Genes—To investigate the transcriptional regulatory functions of mCtr9 during APR initiated by LPS, we first examined the transcript levels of APPs induced by inflammatory signals using a siRNA specific for CTR9. Transfection with CTR9 siRNA decreased protein levels of endogenous CTR9, and the loss of CTR9 resulted in a reduction of protein levels of other PAF components in HEK293 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 2A). Reduced CTR9 expression has been previously reported to alter protein levels of PAF1 and LEO1 in HeLa cells (17Zhu B. Mandal S.S. Pham A.D. Zheng Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Batra S.K. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1668-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cells were next stimulated with increasing amounts of LPS, or with the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 plus its soluble receptor (IL-6sR), and the dose- and time-dependent responses of APP gene mRNA levels were analyzed (Fig. 2B). To obtain the highest induction of APP genes in HepG2 cells, we treated cells with IL-6 and IL-6sR as previously reported (28Mackiewicz A. Schooltink H. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2021-2027PubMed Google Scholar). Because IL-6 plus IL-6sR treatment, but not LPS alone, strongly induced expression of the APP genes fibrinogen (FGGγ) and haptoglobin (HP) in HepG2 cells, we used IL-6 plus IL-6sR as an inflammatory signal for subsequent experiments. We measured transcript levels of the IL-6-inducible APP genes in CTR9-depleted cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Both basal and inducible levels of FGGγ, HP, and SAA were significantly decreased by inhibition of CTR9 expression. Interestingly, transcript levels of the housekeeping genes GAPDH and β-actin remained unchanged, suggesting that CTR9 involves in the regulation of selective subset of gene expressions. To understand the selectivity of target genes, we examined whether CTR9 controls transcript levels of genes induced by other inflammatory signals. Cells were first stimulated with interferon β and expression of the interferon β-inducible genes, ISG-15 and RIG-I, were determined by RT-PCR in CTR9-depleted cells (Fig. 2E). Interferon β induced expression of ISG-15 and RIG-I to a similar extent in cells transfected with CTR9-specific or control siRNA. In addition, expression patterns of the IL-1β or TNFα-inducible genes ICAM-1 and iNOS were not altered in CTR9-depleted cells (Fig. 2F). To further investigate the signal specific gene regulation by CTR9, we then examined transcript levels of SAA and ICAM-1 genes, whose expressions are induced by both IL-6 and IL-1β. Even though IL-6-inducible SAA expression was down-regulated by inhibition of CTR9 (Fig. 2C), IL-1β-induced expression of SAA was not altered (Fig. 2G). Similarly, transcript levels of ICAM-I was reduced by CTR9 inhibition, when it was induced by IL-6 (Fig. 2H). These data indicate that CTR9 does not control the transcription of all inflammatory response genes, but specifically participates in transcription of IL-6-responsive genes. Histone H3 Trimethylation at Lysine 4 in Chromatin Regions Containing IL-6-responsive APP Genes Depends on SH2BP1/CTR9—Because the PAF complex associates with histone-modifying enzymes in various systems, including human (12Krogan N.J.

Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we then addressed whether CTR9 is required for methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 in chromatin regions containing IL-6-responsive APP genes. We performed ChIP on extracts of IL-6-treated HepG2 cells cultured in the presence of control or CTR9-specific siRNAs using an antibody against trimethylated H3-K4 (Fig. 3, A and B). Trimethylation of H3-K4 was increased by IL-6 treatment in chromatin regions containing the HP and FGGγ genes, whereas the GAPDH gene was constitutively trimethylated on H3-K4. Upon inhibition of CTR9 expression, H3-K4 trimethylation was dramatically diminished in the HP and FGGγ genes, while there was little effect on the GAPDH gene. We next examined the methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 in the chromatin regions of IL-6-responsive APP genes. The coding regions of the HP and FGGγ genes were found to be strongly associated with dimethylated histone H3 on lysine 9 residues (Fig. 3C). However inhibition of CTR9 expression did not substantially alter the dimethylation levels of H3-K9 in any of the tested genes, indicating that CTR9 might control transcription primarily through the regulation of histone H3 methylation on lysine 4 in the chromatin regions of IL-6-responsive APP genes. Association of SH2BP1/CTR9 in the Chromatin Regions of the IL-6-responsive APP Genes—Drosophila Paf1 is specifically recruited to the chromatin regions of Hsp70 genes upon heat shock activation to mediate histone methylation and gene induction (23Adelman K. Wei W. Ardehali M.B. Werner J. Zhu B. Reinberg D. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 250-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined occupancy of CTR9 in the chromatin regions of the IL-6-inducible APP genes and GAPDH. We performed ChIP on the promoter and coding regions of the FGG, HP, and GAPDH genes using an anti-CTR9 antibody. Although CTR9 was found to associate with the coding regions of all genes tested, including GAPDH whose expression was not affected by knockdown of CTR9, its association to the promoter region was observed only in HP and FGGγ genes (Fig. 4, B and E). We also examined occupancy of other PAF members, CDC73 and LEO1, in the promoter and coding regions of HP, FGGγ, or GAPDH. Similar to CTR9, CDC73 and LEO1 were found to associate with the coding regions of all genes tested, but their association was not observed in the promoter region of GAPDH locus (Fig. 4, C–E). These results indicate that the occupancy of CTR9 on the promoter regions of APP gene may explain the specificity of transcriptional control by CTR9. SH2BP1/CTR9 Regulates Transcriptional Activity of STAT3 to Control IL-6-responsive Gene Expression—IL-6 activates the JAK tyrosine kinase and the transcription factor STAT3 to transduce inflammatory signals into the nucleus. Phosphorylated forms of STAT3 translocate into the nucleus and bind to specific DNA elements in the promoter regions of target genes (29Akira S. Nishio Y. Inoue M. Wang X.J. Wei S. Matsusaka T. Yoshida K. Sudo T. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1994; 77: 63-71Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 30Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev.

To understand how CTR9 regulates transcript levels of IL-6-inducible genes, we monitored STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity in response to IL-6 stimulation in cells with different levels of CTR9 expression. The transcriptional activity of STAT3 was measured with a dual luciferase assay using a reporter under the regulation of a synthetic STAT3-responsive promoter (m67-luc) or the human haptoglobin promoter/enhancer region (HP-luc). Inhibition of CTR9 expression caused an ∼33% decrease in STAT3 activity in cells stimulated with IL-6 (Fig. 5A). To account for the possibility of nonspecific effects of the siRNA, FLAG-mCtr9 was overexpressed and transcriptional activity of STAT3 was examined using the m67-luc and HP-luc reporters. Increased expression of mCtr9 caused a ∼35% increase in luciferase activity, indicating that CTR9 positively controls the transcriptional activity of STAT3 (Fig. 5B). We also used a siRNA that is specific to human CTR9, but not to mouse Ctr9, to confirm that mCtr9 expression rescued the reduced transcriptional activity by CTR9 siRNA (Fig. 5C). Because the regulatory effect of CTR9 on STAT3 activity was modest, we hypothesized that CTR9 affects the kinetics of STAT3 transcriptional activity rather than its magnitude. To test this hypothesis, we measured transcriptional activity of STAT3 at various times after IL-6 stimulation in FLAG-mCtr9-transfected cells (Fig. 5D). STAT3 transcriptional activity began to increase after IL-6 stimulation and reached a steady state at 2-h poststimulation. In contrast, in CTR9-transfected cells, STAT3 reporter activity reached steady state at ∼3 h after IL-6 stimulation, and the steady state levels were higher than in control cells. These results indicate that increased CTR9 protein levels maintain stronger or longer STAT3-mediated transcriptional activity. Next, we examined the transcriptional regulatory effect of CTR9 in HEK-293 or COS-7 cells. Cells were transiently transfected with the m67-luc reporter and stimulated with IL-6 or Oncostatin M (OSM), a cytokine which also uses gp130 as a receptor and activates JAK/STAT3 signaling pathways (Fig. 5E). Both IL-6- and OSM-stimulated transcriptional activity of STAT3 was further increased by overexpression of FLAG-mCtr9 in all cell lines tested. These data strongly suggest that CTR9 participates in the STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation of IL-6 or OSM inducible genes. To understand the relationship between CTR9 and the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway, we examined the effect of CTR9 in cells transfected with the JAK tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK2 (Fig. 5F). Overexpressed JAK1 and JAK2 increased both basal and IL-6 inducible levels of STAT3 transcriptional activity, which was significantly reduced by cotransfection with the CTR9-specific siRNA. This result suggests that CTR9 functions downstream of JAK kinase activation. SH2BP1/CTR9 contains multiple TPR domains in the N-terminal region, which mediate protein-protein interactions, and serine-rich phosphodomains in the C-terminal region (25Malek S.N. Yang C.H. Earnshaw W.C. Kozak C.A. Desiderio S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6952-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To identify the region of CTR9 responsible for transcriptional control, we constructed N-terminal (FLAG-mCtr9deltaN) and C-terminal (FLAG-mCtr9deltaC) deletion fragments of mCtr9 (Fig. 5G) and performed luciferase assays using the m67-luc reporter in response to IL-6 stimulation. Overexpression of FLAG-Ctr9 further enhanced the transcriptional activity of STAT3, which was not observed in cells transfected with the multiple TPR domain containing N-terminal region of mCtr9 (mCtr9deltaC). In contrast, when cells were transfected with mCtr9-deltaN, transcriptional activity of STAT3 was increased to a level comparable to full-length mCtr9. However, the fold-change after IL-6 treatment appears to be the same in the empty or mCtr9-deltaN transfected cells, indicating that the serine-rich C-terminal region of mCtr9 may responsible for general transcriptional regulation, but not for IL-6 signal-specific gene regulation. It is noteworthy to mention that the transcriptional regulatory effect of C-terminal region of Ctr9 might be underestimated, due to the poor levels of mCtr9-deltaN overexpression. The poor expression was derived from the decreased protein stability of mCtr9-deltaN, as its protein level was increased by treatment with 26 S proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (data not shown). SH2BP1/CTR9 Controls DNA Binding of STAT3 to the Promoter Region of Target Genes—We examined whether CTR9 specifically interacts with nuclear proteins in an IL-6-dependent manner to govern target gene specificity. We first examined the cellular localization of CTR9 and of the phosphorylated forms of STAT3 by immunofluorescent staining in IL-6-stimulated HepG2 cells. The CTR9 protein was observed primarily in the nucleus of HepG2 cells, and its nuclear localization pattern was not significantly changed by treatment with IL-6 (Fig. 6A). However, upon IL-6 stimulation, phosphorylated forms of STAT3 translocated into the nucleus and were predominantly colocalized with CTR9. To examine whether CTR9 interacts with STAT3, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays using cell lysates obtained from cells transfected with FLAG-mCtr9 or FLAG-mCtr9-deltaC mutant. Phosphorylated form of Stat3 was found to associate with full-length of CTR9 in the presence of IL-6 stimulation, but not with C-terminal domain-deleted form of CTR9, indicating that CTR9 might participate in the regulation of IL-6-inducible gene expression through the interaction with activated form of Stat3 (Fig. 6B). To understand how CTR9 controls the transcriptional activity of STAT3, we then analyzed the kinetics of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 in HepG2 cells stimulated with IL-6 (Fig. 6C). In control and CTR9 siRNA-transfected cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was detected by 15 and 30 min after IL-6 stimulation, respectively, with residual activity after 3 h. In addition, the total protein level of STAT3, as well as the JAK1 and JAK2 protein levels, remained unchanged in both CTR9- and control-siRNA-transfected cells, suggesting that the diminished transcriptional activity of STAT3 was not due to the decrease in STAT3 phosphorylation, nor the absolute levels of signaling proteins. Finally, cells were stimulated with IL-6 and STAT3 binding to promoter regions of target genes was determined by ChIP in cells transfected with control or CTR9-specific siRNA. STAT3 association with the promoter regions of FGGγ was dramatically reduced when CTR9 expression was inhibited (Fig. 6D). To better understand the interaction between CTR9 and STAT3, we compared the dynamics of STAT3 DNA binding in cells transfected with control or CTR9-specific siRNA (Fig. 6E). In cells transfected with control siRNA, STAT3 occupied the promoter region of FGGγ for at least 30 min after IL-6 stimulation. In contrast, when the level of CTR9 expression was reduced, STAT3 dissociated from the promoter region after 15 min of IL-6 stimulation. Taken together, these results indicated that CTR9 participates in the IL-6-inducible gene expression through the regulation of DNA association of STAT3 or accessibility of STAT3 to its target DNA sequences. In the present work, we demonstrated that CTR9 specifically participates in the regulation of the transcript levels of IL-6-responsive genes by interacting with the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Our data suggest that, upon IL-6 stimulation, activated STAT3 binds to its binding sites in the promoter regions of the target genes (HP, FGGγ) and interacts with a CTR9-containing complex. This complex then recruits the histone methyltransferase complex and methylates lysine 4 residues on histone H3 to induce target gene expression. Alternatively, CTR9 may provide specificity at the relevant loci by affecting the accessibility of STAT3 to the DNA in a locus-specific fashion. Although there is relatively low nucleosome occupancy at functional transcription factor binding sites on a genome-wide scale, STAT3 binding sites in the promoter regions of FGGγ and HP (32Zauberman A. Lapter S. Zipori D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24719-24725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Zhang Z. Fuller G.M. Blood. 2000; 96: 3466-3472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are predicted to be occupied by nucleosomes, determined by using the probabilistic nucleosome DNA interaction model (34Segal E. Fondufe-Mittendorf Y. Chen L. Thastrom A. Field Y. Moore I.K. Wang J.P. Widom J. Nature. 2006; 442: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is also likely that the chromatin accessibility of STAT3 to the target promoter locus might be affected by the presence of CTR9. Without CTR9, STAT3 binding to its target loci is less stable, which results in failure to recruit the histone methyltransferase complex and impaired gene induction. CTR9 or members of PAF1 complex has not been reported to have sequence-specific DNA binding ability, yet we observed CTR9 in the promoter regions of selective group of genes. It indicates CTR9 might be recruited to its target genes through direct or indirect physical interactions with sequence-specific transcription factors, as reported in Wnt/Wg target gene expression mediated by Parafibromin (Cdc73) and β-catenin/Armadillo interaction (24Mosimann C. Hausmann G. Basler K. Cell. 2006; 125: 327-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Otherwise, specific chromatin structures or modifications that are differentially distributed throughout the genome might be responsible for controlling the recruitment of CTR9 containing complex. Examine the genome-wide occupancy of CTR9 will be helpful to uncover the full scope of CTR9-mediated transcriptional regulation. We have shown that stable association of the STAT3 to the promoter region of target gene was strongly affected by the presence of CTR9. In addition, we observed interaction between STAT3 and CTR9 after IL-6 stimulation. Although we do not know yet whether their interaction is direct or requires other nuclear factors, it clearly indicates that CTR9 containing complex participates in the STAT3-mediated transcriptional activation. Further study investigating the nature of CTR9 containing complex in the promoter regions of target gene and their interactions with other transcription factors or histone are necessary to understand the regulatory potential of CTR9 in the transcription. The effect of protein knockdown of CTR9 on IL-6 target gene expression was appeared to be efficient (Fig. 2), but its effect on STAT3-mediated transcription was somewhat modest (Fig. 4). It suggests that CTR9 might not be the sole regulator of STAT3-mediated gene expression, rather other nuclear or cellular factors are likely involved. It also suggests that other IL-6-mediated signaling pathways that are affected by CTR9 might exist. Because it has been previously reported that IL-6 can transmit its signal through Jak-STAT3 and/or SHP-2 pathways (35Kamimura D. Ishihara K. Hirano T. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 149: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it will be interesting to investigate the effect of CTR9 in the IL-6-induced MAPK-mediated signaling pathways. The yeast Paf1 complex contributes to the post-transcriptional control of transcripts through the regulation of poly(A) site utilization and 3′-end formation (9Mueller C.L. Porter S.E. Hoffman M.G. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 10Penheiter K.L. Washburn T.M. Porter S.E. Hoffman M.G. Jaehning J.A. Mol.

However mRNA stability of Fggγ and Hp were not significantly altered in the cells with decreased CTR9 expression. 5M. Y. Youn, unpublished data. Furthermore, depletion of CTR9 did not alter the poly(A) tail length significantly, while mutation of yeast Paf1 components results in shortened poly(A) tail length (9Mueller C.L. Porter S.E. Hoffman M.G. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the transcriptional regulation of IL-6-inducible genes by CTR9 might be separable from the control of mRNA stability by the Paf1 complex. 6S. Y. Hwang, unpublished data. This is the first report demonstrating that the level of PAF complex can be affected by external stimulus, such as LPS induced inflammation. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS induces systemic inflammation, which involves production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and activation of immune cells. To identify specific inflammatory cytokine signal that is responsible for the transcriptional regulation of CTR9, we treated cells with various inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, OSM, IFN-α/β, and IFNγ, for various times up to 24 h. However, none of these individual cytokines significantly changed the transcript or protein levels of CTR9, suggesting that combined signals of various inflammatory cytokines or other mediators of inflammation that are activated by LPS might be necessary to up-regulate transcription of CTR9. Chronic activation of IL-6-mediated signaling and elevated production of APPs are major problems in chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. Therefore, further studies will be needed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of CTR9. Download .pdf (.08 MB) Help with pdf files"

CCL28-including constructs should be considered in mucosal vaccines to prevent HIV infection of the gastro-intestinal MLP via modulation of IgA-ASC.
https://openalex.org/W2080542254,"Small protein B (SmpB) is a requisite component of the transfer messenger RNA (tmRNA)-mediated bacterial translational quality control system known as trans-translation. The initial binding of tmRNA and its subsequent accommodation into the ribosomal A-site are activities intimately linked to SmpB protein function. From a mechanistic perspective, two key unanswered questions that require further investigation are: 1) what constitutes a stalled ribosome recognition complex and 2) does SmpB pre-bind ribosomes to recruit tmRNA. We have assessed, both in vivo and in vitro, the nature and stability of free SmpB interactions with stalled ribosomes and examined whether these interactions are functionally relevant. We present evidence to demonstrate that interaction of free SmpB with ribosomes is salt sensitive and significantly more labile than interaction of the SmpB.tmRNA complex with ribosomes. Upon dissociation of 70 S ribosomes SmpB partitions primarily with tmRNA rather than ribosomal subunits. This finding is consistent with biochemical and structural data demonstrating that tmRNA is the high-affinity binding partner of SmpB. Moreover, we show that under normal physiological conditions roughly similar numbers of SmpB and tmRNA molecules are present in cells. Our investigations also reveal that upon induction of a nonstop mRNA, SmpB is enriched in stalled ribosome fractions only in the presence of tmRNA. Based on these findings, we conclude that SmpB does not pre-bind stalled ribosome and that functional SmpB-stalled ribosome interactions require tmRNA. We propose that a 1:1:1 complex of SmpB.tmRNA.EF-Tu(GTP) recognizes and binds a stalled ribosome to initiate trans-translation."
https://openalex.org/W2030401561,"RNA-cleaving deoxyribozymes can be used for the sequence-specific knockdown of mRNAs. It was previously shown that activity of these deoxyribozymes is enhanced when their substrate-binding arms include some locked nucleic acid (LNA) residues, but the mechanistic basis of this enhancement was not explored. Here we dissected the kinetics and thermodynamics underlying the reaction of LNA-containing 8–17 deoxyribozymes. Four 8–17 constructs were designed to target sequences within the E6 mRNA from human papillomavirus type 16. When one of these deoxyribozymes (DNAzymes) and the corresponding LNA-armed enzyme (LNAzyme) were tested against a minimal RNA substrate, they showed similar rates of substrate binding and similar rates of intramolecular cleavage, but the LNAzyme released its substrate more slowly. The superior thermodynamic stability of the LNAzyme-substrate complex led to improved performances in reactions carried out at low catalyst concentrations. The four DNAzymes and the corresponding LNAzymes were then tested against extended E6 transcripts (>500 nucleotides long). With these structured substrates, the LNAzymes retained full activity, whereas the DNAzymes cleaved extremely poorly, unless they were allowed to pre-anneal to their targets. These results imply that LNAzymes can easily overcome the kinetic barrier represented by local RNA structure and bind to folded targets with a faster association rate as compared with DNAzymes. Such faster annealing to structured targets can be explained by a model whereby LNA monomers favor the initial hybridization to short stretches of unpaired residues (“nucleation”), which precedes disruption of the local mRNA structure and completion of the binding process.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6151-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The two most prominent examples are the 8–17 and 10–23 deoxyribozymes, originally identified in the Joyce laboratory (2Santoro S.W. Joyce G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4262-4266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar). Both types of deoxyribozymes comprise a central “core” and two substrate-binding arms that can be varied in length and sequence. The chemical stability of these catalysts, their ease of synthesis, and versatility in the sequence-specific cleavage of RNA have prompted a wealth of studies on the potential use of DNAzymes in therapy, to inhibit the expression of disease-causing genes by selectively binding and cleaving the corresponding mRNAs (e.g. (3Cairns M.J.

Pharm. 2006; 32: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)).However, several factors limit the practical use of DNAzymes as anti-gene agents. For example, it may be difficult to achieve an intercellular concentration of DNAzyme high enough to ensure stable binding to the target mRNA and hence efficient knockdown. In part, this problem can be countered by lengthening the substrate-recognition arms, thus increasing the affinity of the DNAzyme for its target, but this entails the synthesis of larger DNA molecules, which are less manageable and more prone to the adoption of alternative structures and to off-target binding. The binding problem is made even worse by the potentially limited accessibility of the intended target sequence within the mRNA structure. Indeed, there are suggestions that up to 90% of potential cleavage sites in long mRNAs are inaccessible to classical DNAzymes (6Cairns M.J. Hopkins T.M. Witherington C. Wang L. Sun L.Q. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 7Kurreck J. Bieber B. Jahnel R. Erdmann V.A. J. Biol.

LNA residues are capable of normal Watson-Crick base pairing, and the locked sugar enhances the preorganization of the phosphate backbone, stabilizing the helical (A-type) structure of a duplex (8Vester B.

With respect to a minimal kinetic scheme for a deoxyribozyme reaction (Fig. 1B), it remains to be established whether the increased affinity alone can explain the improved kinetics, or if LNA also accelerates the intramolecular cleavage step (described by the kinetic constant k2) (11Vester B.

Finally, it is not completely obvious why the improved performances of LNA-containing deoxyribozymes were particularly evident against long RNA transcripts.In relation to these issues, we provide here a detailed kinetic comparison between a well characterized 8–17 construct and a corresponding LNA-armed version. Furthermore, we contrast the performances of four DNAzyme/LNAzyme pairs targeted against different regions of a viral RNA transcript (the E6 mRNA from HPV16). Our findings indicate the following. (i) LNA monomers located in the deoxyribozyme arms have only minimal effects on the cleavage step (k2). (ii) LNA monomers greatly reduce the rate of substrate dissociation (k–1), stabilizing the catalyst-substrate complex. (iii) Finally, the effect on the association step (k1) depends on the type of substrate; with short, unstructured substrates, k1 is nearly equal for DNAzymes and LNAzymes, whereas with long, structured RNAs, the association is substantially faster for LNAzymes as compared with DNAzymes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotides—DNA oligonucleotides were from MWG Biotec (Ebersberg, Germany) or from DNATechnology (Aarhus, Denmark). LNAzymes were synthesized using published procedures (20Wengel J.P. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 301-310Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The minimal (17-mer) RNA substrate for Dz122 and Lz122 was from Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, CO), and when necessary it was 32P-5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. The other minimal substrates were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega), employing the following templates: S32 template, 5′-GTGGTAACTTTCTGGGTCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAG-3′; S51 template, 5′-TGCAGCTCTGTGCATAACCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAG-3′; S122 template, 5′-CATATACCTCACGTCGCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAG-3′; 163 template, 5′-CCCATCTCTATATACTACCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAG-3′.The templates were hybridized to the complementary deoxyoligonucleotide 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3′ to form a double-stranded T7 promoter. Transcription was conducted using the buffer conditions recommended by the supplier and 1 mm nucleoside triphosphates. After transcription, the reaction mixtures were extracted and precipitated, and the full-length RNAs were isolated on a 7 m urea, 13% polyacrylamide gel. RNAs were eluted from gel bands, extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and redissolved in H2O. RNA transcripts were generally 5′-radiolabeled by dephosphorylating using shrimp phosphatase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and subsequently incubating with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [γ-32P]ATP. Concentrations of radioactive oligonucleotides were determined from specific activities; concentrations of nonradioactive oligonucleotides were determined using extinction coefficients at 260 nm estimated by the nearest neighbor method (21Cantor C.R. Warshaw M.M. Shapiro H. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1059-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar).In Vitro Transcription of E6 and E6E7 mRNA—The E6 and E6E7 mRNAs from HPV16 were transcribed in vitro from the corresponding genes. Two plasmids containing the E6 coding sequence (BSK-16-E6) and the E6E7 coding sequence (BKS-16-E6E7) were kindly provided by Massimo Tommasino (International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France). These were Bluescript plasmids (the complete sequence and list of restriction sites are available on line; GenBank™ accession number X52327 (KS(+)) and 52328 (SK(+)).The plasmids were first cut with XhoI (a restriction enzyme whose cleavage site is located in both constructs, shortly downstream of the stop codon, see supplemental Fig. 1) and then transcribed using either T3 RNA polymerase (for E6 RNA) or T7 RNA polymerase (for the E6E7 RNA). The transcription mixture (50 μl) for the nonradioactive substrates contained the following: 10 μl of 5× transcription buffer, 7 mm nucleoside triphosphate, 26 mm MgCl2, 30 mm dithiothreitol, 750 ng of template, and 17 units of T3 RNA polymerase (Amersham Biosciences), or 20 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene). The transcription mixture (20 μl) for the radioactive substrate contained: 4 μl of 5× transcription buffer, 1 mm nucleoside triphosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 29 units of RNasin, 2 μg of template, and polymerases as above.After transcription, the RNAs were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, and purified on a 7 m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel. Full-length transcripts were eluted from gel bands using 2 m NH4Ac, pH 5.3 (elution overnight with 150 μl and wash with 100 μl), extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and redissolved in H2O. Concentrations of radioactive and nonradioactive oligonucleotides were determined using extinction coefficients at 260 nm estimated by the nearest neighbor method (21Cantor C.R. Warshaw M.M. Shapiro H. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1059-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar).Measurement of Individual Rate Constants for Dz122 and Lz122—Reactions of Dz122 and Lz122 against a minimal substrate (17-nt long) were conducted in 50 mm PIPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 3 mm Mg2+, to allow a direct comparison with an earlier study (22Bonaccio M. Credali A. Peracchi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 916-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) where the Dz122 construct was characterized in detail.Cleavage reactions were single turnover, with the catalyst in large excess (≥10-fold) with respect to the labeled substrate, so that the product dissociation step did not affect the observed kinetics (22Bonaccio M. Credali A. Peracchi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 916-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Substrate and catalyst were separately heated at 95 °C for 2 min to disrupt potential aggregates, spun briefly in a microcentrifuge, and equilibrated for 10–30 min at the reaction temperature. After supplementing the catalyst tube with MgCl2, reactions were initiated by adding the substrate. Time points were collected at appropriate intervals, and further reaction was quenched by adding formamide and excess EDTA. Radiolabeled substrates and products were separated on 7 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gels and quantitated by PhosphorImaging. Reaction time courses were fit to the appropriate kinetic equation using SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc.).k2 (describing cleavage within the enzyme-substrate complex) was measured by employing saturating concentrations of the catalyst (≥1 μm) to ensure that all the substrates would be bound to the DNAzyme or LNAzyme (22Bonaccio M. Credali A. Peracchi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 916-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As a control that saturation of the substrate was achieved, the measured rate constants remained identical, within error, when the concentration of catalyst was raised from 1 μm to 5 or 10 μm.The rate constants for substrate dissociation (k–1) and association (k1) were measured through a pulse-chase strategy (22Bonaccio M. Credali A. Peracchi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 916-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To determine k–1, a saturating concentration of DNAzyme or LNAzyme (100 nm) was first allowed to bind a trace amount of radiolabeled substrate (∼0.1 nm) for 4 min, in the presence of 3 mm MgCl2 (over this time, <1% of the substrate was cleaved). Then a large excess of unlabeled substrate (1 μm final) was added to initiate the “chase” period, during which dissociation of labeled substrate from the catalyst was essentially irreversible. An otherwise identical reaction, but without the chase, was carried out in parallel. Partitioning of the labeled substrate between cleavage and release depended on the relative magnitude of k–1 and k2. In particular, the fractional extent of cleavage in the presence of the chase (relative to the extent in the absence of chase) reflected the ratio k2/(k–1 + k2) (23Fersht, A. R. (1985) Enzyme Structure and Mechanism, pp. 137–273, W. H. Freeman & Co., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Thus, measuring k2 and the final extent of cleavage allowed determination of k–1.A pulse-chase method was also used to determine k1. In these experiments, an excess DNAzyme or LNAzyme (1–15 nm) was first allowed to bind a trace amount of radiolabeled substrate for a period, t1, variable from 0.5 to 7 min (over this time, <1% of the substrate was cleaved). Then the sample was transferred into a solution containing a large excess of unlabeled substrate (to prevent any further binding of radioactive substrate) as well as 15 mm Mn2+, pH 7.8. Because of the high concentration of Mn2+ and the increased pH, all the bound labeled substrate was cleaved in less than 3 min (22Bonaccio M. Credali A. Peracchi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 916-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), so that the fraction of cleaved substrate reflected the amount of catalyst-substrate complex formed at t1. The dependence of such a fraction on t1 was fit to a single exponential function, yielding a pseudo-first order rate constant for substrate binding, kapp. k1 was obtained from a linear regression of the kapp values versus the catalyst concentration.Cleavage of Long RNA Transcripts—Cleavage of the E6 and E6E7 mRNAs were measured under single-turnover conditions at 37 °C. The reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.008% SDS.Two distinct kinetic protocols were used. In protocol A, the DNAzyme (or LNAzyme) and the mRNA substrate were heated separately in reaction buffer, in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2. After this heating step (2 min at 80 °C), the samples were spun briefly in a microcentrifuge and equilibrated for 10 min at the reaction temperature. The cleavage reactions were initiated by mixing the catalyst and substrate solutions. The reaction mixture contained 10 nm RNA (final concentration) and 100 nm catalyst (10-fold molar excess). Aliquots were collected at appropriate times and quenched by adding formamide and excess EDTA.In protocol B, cleavage rates were determined after pre-annealing the catalyst and the mRNA. Annealing was achieved by heating together the DNAzyme (or LNAzyme) and RNA in reaction buffer at 80 °C for 2 min, followed by cooling in two steps (50 °C for 5 min; 37 °C for 10 min). The cleavage reactions were then started by adding MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mm. The concentrations of enzyme and RNA were as above.Substrates and products of the cleavage reactions were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gels and quantitated by a PhosphorImager. The fraction of product at time t, Ft, was calculated by dividing the amount of product by the amount of substrate plus product, and the data were fit to a single-exponential function as shown in Equation 1, Ft=F∞(1−e−kobst)(Eq. 1) where F∞ is the fraction of product at the end point of the reaction, and kobs is the rate constant of cleavage (23Fersht, A. R. (1985) Enzyme Structure and Mechanism, pp. 137–273, W. H. Freeman & Co., New YorkGoogle Scholar). Sometimes the reaction was clearly biphasic, and the data were hence fit to a double exponential function as shown in Equation 2, Ft=F1(1−e−kobs1t)+F2(1−e−kobs2t)(Eq. 2) where F1 and F2 represent the end points of the first and second phase of the time course, respectively.RESULTSConstructs Used—In this study, we compared the activities of four conventional 8–17 DNAzymes with their partially LNA-armed counterparts (LNAzymes; Fig. 2). All four 8–17 constructs were directed against the E6 mRNA from HPV16. This mRNA is a well established model system to explore the application of antisense and catalytic antisense oligonucleotides, and much experimental information is available about the accessibility of different parts of the RNA sequence (e.g. see Refs. 6Cairns M.J.

The four constructs were designed to recognize 17-nt-long RNA targets on the E6 RNA. The number in the name of each construct refers to the position of cleavage within the E6 coding sequence. Against each target we tested one 8–17 DNAzyme (composed only of DNA monomers) and one LNAzyme (in which four or five nucleotides in the arms were replaced by LNA monomers). DNA is shown in boldface letters, and the positions at which LNA monomers were introduced are circled. Note that cytidine LNA residues are methylated at the 5-position. The RNA target sequences are shown as normal letters, and the arrows indicate the cleavage sites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The four 8–17 constructs were designed to cleave at specific AG sites, located within the first 200 nucleotides of the E6 coding sequence. Dz32 was designed to hybridize to a sequence that overlaps the best target sequence identified by Pan et al. (25Pan W.H. Xin P. Bui V. Clawson G.A. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), who tested the accessibility of the E6 mRNA by using a library of hammerhead ribozymes. The Dz122 target sequence includes two of the four best cleavage sites identified by Cairns et al. (6Cairns M.J. Hopkins T.M. Witherington C. Wang L. Sun L.Q. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), using a library of 10–23 deoxyribozymes. The target of Dz163 encompassed one accessible cleavage site identified by Pan et al. (25Pan W.H. Xin P. Bui V. Clawson G.A. Mol.

Sun L.Q. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 480-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Finally, Dz51 was used as a control; it targets a sequence that previous studies found only modestly accessible (6Cairns M.J. Hopkins T.M. Witherington C. Wang L. Sun L.Q. Nat.

Therefore, we employed this construct for a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic comparison with the corresponding LNAzymes (termed Lz122), using a short 17-mer RNA substrate.The rate constant for cleavage of the 17-mer RNA within the enzyme-substrate complex (k2) was measured in single-turnover reactions (ensuring that the product dissociation step did not affect the observed kinetics) and at saturating deoxyribozyme concentrations (≥1 μm; see Ref. 22Bonaccio M. Credali A. Peracchi A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 916-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Dz122 and Lz122 showed very similar k2 values, both at 25 and 37 °C (Table 1), indicating that the introduction of the four LNA monomers in the 8–17 arms has only marginal effects on the intramolecular strand-scission step.TABLE 1Comparison of the catalytic parameters for the reactions catalyzed by Dz122 and Lz122ConstructTemperaturek2k1k-1KS°Cmin-1m-1min-1min-1nmDz1222510-21.7 × 1072 × 10-21.2Lz122256 × 10-33.3 × 1071.6 × 10-30.05Dz122372.8 × 10-2Lz122372.2 × 10-2 Open table in a new tab The measured association rate constants (k1) also showed differences of less than 2-fold between Dz122 and Lz122 (Table 1), in agreement with previous indications that LNAs have only minimal effects on the hybridization rate between short oligonucleotides (18Christensen U. Jacobsen N. Rajwanshi V.K. Wengel J. Koch T. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 481-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Much larger differences were observed when measuring k–1, the rate constant for dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex. The values of k–1 for Dz122 and Lz122 differed by more than 10-fold, reflecting the different stabilities of binding for the two catalysts. From the kinetic constants k1 and k–1, we could also calculate the thermodynamic constant for substrate dissociation (KS = k–1/k1), which was ∼25-fold lower for the LNAzyme (Table 1).These data were buttressed by UV melting studies on the complexes formed by the enzymes with a noncleavable substrate analog, bearing a single deoxyribonucleotide at the cleavage site. The experiments showed that the melting temperature (Tm) for the complex between Lz122 and the substrate analog was ≈20 °C higher than for the Dz122 complex (58 °C versus 38 °C, using 2 μm catalyst and 2 μm substrate analog; see supplemental Fig. 2). These findings are in agreement with published data, which report that the Tm of short DNA-RNA duplexes is increased by 4–7 °C per each pyrimidine LNA monomer introduced in the DNA sequence (30Singh, S. K., Nielsen, P., Koshkin, A. A., and Wengel, J. (1998) Chem. Commun. 455–456Google Scholar, 31Singh, S. K., and Wengel, J. (1998) Chem. Commun. 1247–1248Google Scholar, 32Bondensgaard K. Petersen M.

The results also indicate that, with length and sequence of the binding arms being equal, an LNAzyme can be employed at a range of temperatures much wider than its all-DNA counterpart (supplemental Fig. 3).Activities of Dz122 and Lz122 as a Function of Catalyst Concentratio"
https://openalex.org/W2034223032,"Nearest-centroid classifiers have recently been successfully employed in high-dimensional applications, such as in genomics. A necessary step when building a classifier for high-dimensional data is feature selection. Feature selection is frequently carried out by computing univariate scores for each feature individually, without consideration for how a subset of features performs as a whole. We introduce a new feature selection approach for high-dimensional nearest centroid classifiers that instead is based on the theoretically optimal choice of a given number of features, which we determine directly here. This allows us to develop a new greedy algorithm to estimate this optimal nearest-centroid classifier with a given number of features. In addition, whereas the centroids are usually formed from maximum likelihood estimates, we investigate the applicability of high-dimensional shrinkage estimates of centroids. We apply the proposed method to clinical classification based on gene-expression microarrays, demonstrating that the proposed method can outperform existing nearest centroid classifiers."
https://openalex.org/W1983130174,"Estrogens are mitogenic in human breast cancer cells, but the presence of estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) is associated with a favorable prognosis in primary tumors and the molecular basis for this paradoxical relationship remains unknown. Here we show that ER alpha and ER alpha mutants devoid of ligand and DNA-binding domains inhibit cell growth in three-dimensional matrix as well as tumor formation in nude mice. Using in vitro and intracellular approaches, we have found that ER alpha, via its amino acids 184-283, interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(WAF1). Both proteins exhibit mutual interactions in the absence of estrogens or in the presence of pure antiestrogen ICI(182,780), whereas estradiol treatment disrupts their interactions. Cross-linking experiments reveal that these proteins are present in a larger complex of approximately 200 kDa that also contains cdk2 and cyclin E. We further demonstrate that the unliganded full-length ER alpha or the variant having the p21(WAF1) interaction region significantly increases p21(WAF1) expression, whereas ER alpha silencing reduces p21(WAF1) levels and silencing of p21(WAF1) is sufficient to prevent ER alpha-induced growth inhibition. Taken together, our results point to an antiproliferative function of the unliganded ER alpha through its physical interactions with p21(WAF1) that may also explain the favorable prognosis of ER alpha-positive breast cancers."

These interactions are proposed to take place in the two-dimensional interface between cells, but there are only limited data on such interactions and no quantitative data on formation of the trimolecular bridges as proposed for alefacept. Determining such parameters in a model system would be a first step to development of a system of two-dimensional pharmacology to better predict in vivo behavior in cell-cell contact areas based on in vitro measured interaction parameters. Information like affinity and maximum binding has been mainstays of modern pharmacology for over 50 years. The availability of such tools for adhesion mediating drugs would aid in development of effective biological and small molecule drugs based on bridging surface receptor to induce adhesion or cell-cell signaling. An equilibrium model to predict the ability of immunoadhesins, and related compounds including antibodies, to mediate adhesion would be useful to evaluate current and future pharmaceuticals. The chemistry of these interactions at cell interfaces has been poorly understood due to the technical difficulty of quantifying molecular interactions in cell-cell interfaces. One approach to this problem has been to study the molecular interactions in the hybrid cell-supported planar bilayer system (6Dustin M.L. Golan D.E. Zhu D.M. Miller J.M. Meier W.

Glass-supported planar bilayers consist of a phospholipid bilayer supported on a layer of water molecules on a glass, quartz, or SiO2 surface (11Weis R.M. Balakrishnan K. Smith B.A. McConnell H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6440-6445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bilayer can contain fluorescently labeled receptors and control molecules that are freely mobile in the bilayer. Interaction between these receptors and cell surface molecules in hybrid cell-supported planar bilayer junctions, referred to subsequently as an adhesion area, induces accumulation of the fluorescent receptors and partial exclusion of non-interacting control molecules in the bilayer, which can be detected by fluorescence microscopy. Varying the density of receptors in the substrate enables analysis of adhesion area growth and two-dimensional affinity measurements using the Golan-Zhu method, which makes the assumption that receptor interactions are confined to the adhesion site, while free receptors diffuse over the entire cell surface (6Dustin M.L.

The interactions of CD2 with CD58 has been studied in detail using supported planar bilayers and the Golan-Zhu analysis revealing a two-dimensional Kd in the range of 1.1–7.6 molecules/μm2 and a maximal binding (Bmax) close to the total number of cell surface CD2 accessible by antibodies (6Dustin M.L.

These results are consistent with self-assembly of an ordered interface into which CD2 diffuses freely. Our hypothesis is that immunoadhesin-mediated adhesion works by similar self-assembly of ordered junctions between cell membranes containing target epitopes and Fc receptors. In this report we describe a detailed equilibrium model for alefacept mediated adhesion. We test the model by fitting experimental data and derive estimates for key parameters. The model incorporates a growth rule based on constant density of bonds that is well fit by the data. A key prediction of the model is that the concentration of alefacept needed to initiate an adhesion area is inversely proportion to the square of the CD2 density. This prediction is important because it implies that a 5-fold higher expression of a receptor on a target compared with a bystander cell will result in initiation of interaction with the target at 25-fold lower concentration of alefacept than needed to initiate adhesion to the bystander. We experimentally verify this prediction. The data indicate that rules governing access of alefacept-CD2 complexes to the adhesion area are not fully understood and identify areas for further study. Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes (PBL)—In Fig. 1, lymphocytes were separated from freshly drawn peripheral blood (from healthy volunteers employed at Biogen Idec) using Ficoll-hypaque gradient centrifugation, as previously described (3Majeau G.R. Meier W. Jimmo B. Kioussis D. Hochman P.S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2753-2767PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 5 human peripheral blood T cells were obtained from the New York Blood Center (New York, NY). Naive and memory cells were isolated by negative selection with magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA).FIGURE 5CD2 expression and alefacept-mediated adhesion. A, peripheral blood T cells were separated into naive and memory populations using appropriate MACS kits to obtain >90% pure populations. Cells were stained with saturating concentrations of FITC-TS2/18 (solid lines) or control antibody FITC-YN1/1 (dashed lines), washed, and analyzed. Naive (1× thickness line), memory (2× thickness line), and effector (3× thickness line) were analyzed and calibrated to IgG bound using FITC calibration beads and antibody F:P ratios. Data are representative of three experiments. B, percent adhesion was analyzed with naive T cells (open triangles), memory T cells (open squares) or in vitro activated T cell blasts (filled circles) on planar bilayers containing 500 molecules/μm2 CD16B and the indicated concentration of Alefacept at 24 °C for 60 min. In separate experiments plotted on the same graph, adhesion of Jurkat cells (filled triangles) or Jurkat cells with 80% of CD2 blocked by TS2/18 Fab (filled squares) to bilayers with 500 molecules/μm2 CD16B was measured at two concentrations of alefacept spanning a 25-fold range. Adhesion was scored by interference reflection microscopy and bright field microscopy and confirmed by evaluation of CD16 fluorescence in the adhesion area. At least 10 fields were analyzed with greater than 200 input cells. Symbols are listed in legend. Data are representative of three experiments for each point. C, forward scatter analysis for cell populations analyzed in A. Data are representative of three experiments. D, titration of TS2/18 Fab (x and + symbols are two Fab preps) to determine the concentration needed to block 80% of CD2 molecules (dashed lines). “Saturation” binding of TS2/18 IgG (filled circles) is shown for comparison.

Jurkat cells used in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 were originally obtained from A. Chan (Genentech, S. San Francisco, CA). The gene encoding enhanced green fluorescence protein (eGFP) was fused to the C terminus of a human CD2 cDNA using standard molecular biology techniques, and the resulting fusion construct was verified by sequencing (14Douglass A.D. Vale R.D. Cell. 2005; 121: 937-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were transiently transfected with CD2-GFP by electroporation and allowed to recover for 72–96 h prior to imaging.FIGURE 3Alefacept effect on CD2 lateral mobility and adhesion formation. A, single molecule analysis of short range diffusion of CD2-GFP on untreated Jurkat cells. n = 716 particles, D = 0.18 μm2/s. The black area includes all events that may be “immobile” in that their movement is less than or equal to that of GFP attached to glass, whereas the gray area includes particles with greater diffusion that GFP attached to glass. By this criterion 87% of the particles are unambiguously mobile. B, short-range diffusion analysis on cells treated with 0.5 μm alefacept. n = 827 particles. D = 0.08 μm2/s. By the criteria applied in C, 62% of the particles are mobile. Data are representative of two experiments.

Amount of bound CD16B in the interface (open squares) and percent adhesion (filled circles) at indicated concentrations of soluble alefacept. Each point represents the mean of greater than 100 adhesion areas. E, titration of CD16B density in the bilayer at the optimal concentration of alefacept (0.5 μm).

A, mechanistic steps in immunoadhesin-mediated adhesion. The 7 reaction steps considered in the bivalent model and the relationships that must be satisfied based on the law of detailed balance (equations shown). B and C, CD16B binding under conditions where the initial CD16B density equals 1200 molecules/μm2 (B) and 625 molecules/μm2 (C). Each data point is determined by greater than 100 Jurkat T cell adhesion areas in which the area (filled symbols) and bound CD16 number (open symbols) was measured. In the model, the density of bridges in the adhesion area is constant (β = B/A). The solid lines in B and C are the simultaneous fit of the model to the area and bound CD16 data at the two CD16B densities using nonlinear least squares regression based on a finite difference Lenvenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The model predicts that bivalent alefacept-CD2 interaction dominates a low alefacept concentration (dot-dash-dash line), while monovalent binding dominates at higher alefacept concentration (dashed line). In the fit the following parameters were held constant: Acell = 800 μm2, K = 6.7 × 105 m–1, KR = 1.3 × 106 m–1, and Kx = 0.033 μm2. The best fit values of the four parameters that were varied were: β = 200 molecules/μm2, Kb1 = 3.1 μm2, Kb2 = 630 μm2, and NT = 4,350 CD2 per cell. A reasonable fit could not be obtained if we fixed NT = 40,000 CD2 per cell. D, straight line fit of bound CD16B versus adhesion area.

Simple linear regression sets β = 190 molecules/μm2, close to the fit of 200 molecules/μm2 that takes into account all model parameters. E, predictions of Lmin and Lmax. Symbols are calculated values. The solid line has a slope of 1, and the dashed line a slope of –2 indicating that Lmax is directly proportional to the CD2 density and that Lmin is inversely proportional to the square of the CD2 density. Note that the model predicts that below 320 CD2 per cell there is no alefacept concentration at which adhesion occurs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6CD2 distribution and inhibition by soluble IgG. A, Jurkat T cells were stained with FITC-CD2.1 Fab and allowed to interact with planar bilayers containing 200 molecules/μm2 CD58 or 500 molecules/μm2 CD16 in the presence of 1 μm alefacept. Confocal microscopy was used to obtain a BF image, an IRM image, and a 488-nm laser excitation, 530/30-nm band pass confocal scan through the middle of the cell (FITC-CD2.1). The faint signal from the cell on CD58 indicates extensive redistribution of CD2 to the interface. Scale bar = 10 μm. B, percent CD2 loss from the cells was determined for 100 cells in each condition relative to FITC-CD2.1 Fab-labeled Jurkat cells adhering to CD80, which does not induce any reorganization of CD2, to determine, which was used to obtain the 100% value. The “non-contact” value was directly measured and the “contact” value was calculated based on the assumption that all CD2 lost from the non-contact surface is located in the interface. C, Jurkat T cell adhesion to supported planar bilayers containing 450 molecules/μm2 CD16B at 500 nm alefacept and the indicated concentration of protein A-purified human IgG.

At least 10 fields were analyzed with greater than 200 input cells. Data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Alefacept—The fusion protein designated herein as alefacept is composed of the first extracellular domain of CD58 fused to the hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains of human IgG1 (15Miller G.T.

For a subset of experiments, to eliminate the possibility that the results might be influenced by aggregated protein that might be present at very low concentrations, the material was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on Superose-6 (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, 2 ml of alefacept (15 mg/ml) were loaded onto a 1.6 × 100 cm Superose-6 column equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline at a flow rate of 40 ml/h. Individual fractions were analyzed for aggregate content by analytical size exclusion chromatography using a TSK-3000 column (Toso-Haas, Montgomeryville, PA). Fractions with an aggregate content of <0.5% were pooled, concentrated by ultracentrifugation using YM-30 Centriprep filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA), aliquoted and stored at –70 °C. The final aggregate content was determined to be to be <0.5% after the concentrated pool (12.4 mg/ml) had been put through one freeze/thaw cycle. Molar concentrations of alefacept were calculated with a molecular weight of 72,000. Alefacept-mediated Adhesion Assay—CHO cells transfected with human CD2 were grown to confluence in wells of flat bottom 96-well plates. Wells were washed twice, and 50 μlof varying concentrations of alefacept were added. Plates were then washed or unwashed as indicated. 105 CD16+ Jurkat cells, which were labeled with BCECF-AM according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR), were then added in 50 μl to wells. Plates were incubated for 0.5 h at 37 °C or 24 °C. Wells were then washed four times. Background signal was that of wells without cells, incubated and washed as were the experimental groups. Total input was the signal released from 105 BCECF-AM labeled cells. The percent binding was determined as the (experimental minus background counts) divided by (total input minus background counts) × 100. Cytotoxicity Assay—Targets were human PBL blasts. Briefly, 106 PBL were cultured with 10 μg/ml final concentration of PHA for 3 days. PHA blasts were then collected, washed, 100 μCi of 51Cr was added to 107 cells, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, washed, counted, and resuspended in complete medium. 5 × 103 target cells in 20 μl were added to wells of round bottom 96 well microtiter plates. PBLs freshly prepared from normal donors on the day of the assay were added to the target cells to make a total volume of 200 μl and an effector to target ratio of 50:1. Alefacept was added to wells at the indicated concentrations. Microtiter plates were incubated in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 4 h, centrifuged, and 150 μl of supernatant was removed to measure released 51Cr in a Liquid Scintillation Counter (Wallac Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Spontaneous release (SR) was counts released from target cells in the presence of medium alone, and maximum release (MR) was counts released from target cells incubated in the presence of 0.5% Triton. Percent lysis was calculated as (experimental minus SR cpm) divided by (MR cpm minus SR cpm). Previously it was shown that fusion protein mediated cytotoxicity was inhibited by the addition of blocking mAbs specific for CD16 to the 4-h assay cultures. Lysis is dependent on the expression of CD2 by the target cells (3Majeau G.R. Meier W. Jimmo B. Kioussis D. Hochman P.S. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2753-2767PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry experiments were performed on a Becton Dickinson FacsCalibur. FITC labeling of antibodies and determination of the fluoresceine: protein ratio was determined using absorption spectroscopy (16Wells A.F. Miller C.E. Nadel M.K. Appl. Microbiol. 1966; 14: 271-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Calibration was performed using FITC standard beads obtained from Bangs Laboratories (Fishers, IN). Antibody-stained cells were washed twice prior to analysis. Alefacept binding modified from Majeau et al. (7Majeau G.R. Whitty A. Yim K. Meier W. Hochman P.S. Cell Adhes Commun. 1999; 7: 267-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Alefacept was labeled with 0.8 FITC/alefacept. Binding was analyzed by flow cytometry without washing away free alefacept. Because the sample stream does not mix with the sheath fluid prior to reaching the interrogation point there was no alefacept dilution prior to analysis. When the free FITC-alefacept concentration exceeded 100 nm linearity problems were detected with FITC standard beads. To achieve higher concentration of alefacept we then added unlabeled alefacept while keeping the FITC-alefacept at 100 nm. The binding was allowed to reach equilibrium for 5 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was assessed after saturating CD2 on the cells with 100 μg/ml of TS2/18. We found that TS2/18 did not dissociate even with high concentrations of alefacept. The fluorescence standard beads were read in parallel at the same concentration of free alefacept to generate a standard curve to determine the number of alefacept molecules bound per cell. Planar Bilayers—All phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Human CD58 was purified from human red blood cells and labeled with FITC while bound to the anti-CD58 antibody TS2/9 (9Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.Y. Springer T.A. Golan D.E. J.

Mouse CD48 was labeled with Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences), by a similar procedure, but with OX78 mAb (rat anti-mouse CD48) (18Kato K. Koyanagi M. Okada H. Takanashi T. Wong Y.W. Williams A.F. Okumura K.

CD16B was purified from CD16B transfected Jurkat cells using 3G8 mAb (IgG was purified from the hybridoma) and was labeled with Cy3 (Amersham Biosciences) while attached to 3G8 agarose. The CD16B was eluted at pH 3 in a solution with 1% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. Planar bilayers composed of 0.4 mm egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) were prepared by detergent dialysis as previously described (9Dustin M.L. Ferguson L.M. Chan P.Y. Springer T.A. Golan D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 465-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Bilayers were formed on clean glass coverslips (chromic sulfuric acid for 15 min then rinsed with deionized water, high purity acetone, and dried under a nitrogen stream) in a FCS II flow cell (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). Bilayer formation was initiated by trapping a 1-μl drop or liposome suspension between the coverslip and microaqueduct slide separated by a 250-μm gasket. After 20 min, the flow cell was perfused with 5 ml of Hepes-buffered saline 1% human serum albumin (HBS/HSA; 20 mm Hepes, 1.7 mm K2HPO4, 137 mm, NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose, 1% clinical grade human serum albumin, pH 7.4.). The surface was then blocked with 5% casein in phosphate-buffered saline. After 20 min, the flow cell was again perfused with HBS/HSA. Imaging—The microscope used to acquire images was equipped with a cooled CCD camera and excitation and emission filter wheels (Yona Microscopes, Silver Spring, MD) (19Dustin M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15782-15788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The filter set was the XF93 triple band dichroic mirror and individual excitation and emission filters recommended by the manufacturer for FITC, Cy3, and Cy5 dyes (Omega, Burlington, VT). Using this filter set there was no detectable cross-detection of the different dyes in each others filter combinations. A Zeiss ×100 Plan-Neofluar or Neofluar 1.3 NA objective was used for all experiments. Digital images were acquired using IP-Lab software and processed by background subtraction and flat field correction prior to segmentation and analysis of adhesion areas. Bleaching was performed with the focused beam from a Spectraphysics 2.5 W Krypton-Argon laser with wavelength selection using a acoustooptic tunable filter (Solamere Technologies, Salt Lake City, UT). Single Molecule Imaging of GFP-CD2—Glass-bottomed observation dishes (MatTek Inc., Ashland, MA) were cleaned thoroughly with a 2:1 mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid and 30% hydrogen peroxide prior to use. Cells expressing low levels of CD2-GFP were imaged using objective-type total internal reflection fluorescence excitation on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 m microscope equipped with a Mega-10 ICCD camera (Stanford Photonics, Palo Alto, CA). Cells were treated with 0.5 μm alefacept in HBS, or with HBS alone, and allowed to adhere to glass-bottom observation dishes for 10 min prior to imaging. Movies were then acquired at 30 frames per second in 200-frame bursts during a 10-min period. A suite of particle tracking functions written in the IDL language by John Crocker and colleagues was used to identify trajectories in each image. Short-range diffusion coefficients were determined using Mat-lab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) scripts that perform mean-squared displacement analyses of overla"

This study shows the CLD of RanBP2 promotes selectively the accumulation of a subset of reporter substrates of the UPS, such as the ubiquitin (Ub)-fusion yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) degradation substrate, UbG76V-YFP, and the N-end rule substrate, Ub-R-YFP. Conversely, the degradation of endoplasmic reticulum and misfolded proteins, and of those linked to UPS-independent degradation, is not affected by CLD. The selective effect of CLD on the UPS in vivo is independent of, and synergistic with, proteasome inhibitors, and CLD does not affect the intrinsic proteolytic activity of the 20S proteasome. The inhibitory activity of CLD on the UPS resides in a purported SUMO binding motif. We also found two RanBP2 substrates, RanGTPase-activating protein and retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator interacting protein-1α1, whose steady-state levels are selectively modulated by CLD.

Multiple lines of evidence support that the 19S regulatory particle (RP; designated also as the 19S cap) of the 26S proteasome is subjected to multiple levels of regulation and likely, remodeling, by loosely associated factors. For example, loss-of-function of the yeast subunit, Rpn10, has modest phenotypic effects (7Fu H. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. van Nocker S. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol.

Likewise, the yeast subunits Rpn1, Rpn9, and Rpn2 are not lethal in yeast, the phenotype varies with the genetic background, and they are synthetic lethal (13DeMarini D.J. Papa F.R. Swaminathan S.

More importantly, a growing number of factors identified to interact with the 19S RP appear to be critical for substrate targeting and/or docking to the 26S proteasome (2Ferrell K. Wilkinson C.R.

These auxiliary factors likely define complementary pathways of the UPS and confer a critical layer of specificity to compartmentalize the proteolytic activity of the 26S proteasome. Overexpression of some of these factors inhibits UPS-mediated proteolysis (18Kleijnen M.F. Shih A.H. Zhou P. Kumar S. Soccio R.E. Kedersha N.L. Gill G. Howley P.M. Mol.

On the other hand, a number of other factors such as Parkin, an E3-ligase, and ataxin-7, interact with specific subunits of the proteasome, such as S5a (Rpn10) and S4 (Rpt2), respectively (20Matilla A.

We previously identified a novel domain, the cyclophilin-like domain (CLD), in RanBP2, with low yet significant homology to its C-terminal cyclophilin domain (35Ferreira P.A. Hom J.T. Pak W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23179-23188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have shown that the CLD of RanBP2 associates specifically with the S1 (p112) subunit of the 19S cap of proteasome, suggesting that RanBP2, via its CLD domain, may modulate the activity of the UPS and protein biogenesis (45Ferreira P.A. Yunfei C. Schick D. Roepman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24676-24682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the functional implication(s) of the CLD of RanBP2 on the UPS activity remains elusive. In this report, we employ various sensors of the UPS to probe the impact in vivo of the CLD of RanBP2 on the activity of UPS. We found that the CLD strongly promotes the selective accumulation of a subset of UPS sensors and the biogenesis of selective substrates. Expression Constructs—The bovine sequence of CLD domain and its variants were amplified by PCR from bovine RanBP2 cDNA using Pfu and subcloned into the vector, pDEST733, in-frame with N-terminal tag, red fluorescent protein (RFP), using the Gateway Cloning System (Invitrogen). Point mutations and deletion constructs were generated by PCR from cDNA of RanBP2 with primers harboring the cognate mutated nucleotides and complementary to various regions of CLD. All constructs produced were confirmed by DNA sequencing. RFP sequence in pDEST733 was replaced with that of YFP to generate the vector, pDEST733Y. Bovine retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator interacting protein-1 (bRPGRIP1α1) cDNA (55Ferreira P.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: R259-R267Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pDEST733Y using Gateway Cloning System. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) reporter constructs, pUbG76V-YFP, pUb-R-YFP, pYFP-CL1, and pCd3δ-YFP, were kindly provided by N. Dantuma. The UPS-independent degradation reporter construct, pGFP-DE, was generated by inserting the PCR-generated 120-bp 3′ end coding sequence of the mouse ornithine decarboxylase into the vector, pIRES2-EGFP, at the 3′ end of EGFP coding sequence. The GST-CLD fusion construct was described elsewhere (45Ferreira P.A. Yunfei C. Schick D. Roepman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24676-24682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). GST-CLDMut was generated by mutating the amino acids, Ile2634 and Val2635 of human RanBP2, to lysine and alanine, respectively. Cell Culture and Transfection—RGC-5 and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were plated in 6-well plates 1 day before transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were either detached by trypsinization for whole cell fluorescence measurement, or lysed directly in SDS-sample buffer for Western blot analysis. UPS Reporter Assays—COS7 cells in 6-well plates co-expressing a reporter construct and a test construct were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were resuspended in 330 μl of phosphate-buffered saline per well and three aliquots of 100 μl each were transferred to 96-well plates for fluorescence reading using SpectraMax M5 microplate reader (Molecular Devices). All data shown represent the average of three experiments. Two-tailed equal variance t test was performed. For yellow fluorescence (YFP), excitation/emission/cutoff = 510/530/530 nm; for red fluorescence (RFP), excitation/emission/cutoff = 575/607/590 nm; for green fluorescence (EGFP), excitation/emission/cutoff = 480/510/510 nm. 20S Proteasome Activity Assay—To measure the proteasome activity of living cells, COS7 cells were cultured in 6-well plates and transfected with RFP-CLD or empty RFP vector alone. Twenty-four hours later, 100 μm fluorogenic peptide substrate, Suc-LLVY-amc, with or without MG132 (60 μm) or lactacystin (20 μm), was added to the media and incubated for an additional 2 h. Two hundred μl of medium was taken for measurement of free amc (excitation/emission/cutoff = 380/460/455 nm). To measure proteasome activities in cell extracts, cellular protein extraction and proteasome activity measurement were performed as described by Kisselev and Goldberg (56Kisselev A.F. Goldberg A.L. Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 364-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Proteasome substrates were purchased from Biomol. GST Pulldown Assay—Pulldown assays were described (45Ferreira P.A.

Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 455-468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured RGC-5 and COS7 cells were lysed in CHAPS lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.25 m NaCl, 0.75% CHAPS, 5% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was precleared with the incubation of 100 μg/ml GST and glutathione S-agarose beads, and then used for GST pulldown. Western Blot Analysis and Antibodies—Proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Membrane was blocked by milk and incubated with respective primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and detection by SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Pierce). The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal mitochodrial Hsp70 (MA3-028, 1:1000) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against proteasome subunits (S1, PA1–973; S3, PA1–974; S4, PA1–965; S5A, PA1–966; S7, PA1–969; S10B, PA1–962) from Affinity BioReagents and used at 0.4 μg/ml; Living Color DsRed polyclonal antibody (1:2000) was purchased from Clontech; antibody against PA700 was a gift from G. DeMartino; H2 monoclonal antibody (0.4 μg/ml) against bovine brain kinesin heavy chain was a gift from George Bloom; anti-Ubc9 polyclonal antibody (1:500) was a gift from Mary Dasso; Nup62 was from BD Transduction Laboratories (1:5000); ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (P4D1, 1: 1000) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; monoclonal nuclear pore complex protein/RanBP2 antibody clone Mab414 (0.4 μg/ml) was purchased from Covance Babco; monoclonal anti-RanGAP1 (1:1000) was a gift from Elias Coutavas; rabbit polyclonal HK1 was a gift from Steve Wilson; the anti-importin β (Mab3E9, 0.4 μg/ml) antibody was a gift from Steve Adam, the mouse antibody against NPHP4 (1:1000) was a gift from R. Ropeman, Ab38 against RPGRIP1 (125 ng/ml) was described earlier (58Roepman R. Bernoud-Hubac N. Schick D.E. Maugeri A. Berger W. Ropers H.H. Cremers F.P. Ferreira P.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2095-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and the anti-GMP1 (SUMO-1; 400 ng/ml) monoclonal antibody was from Invitrogen. The CLD of RanBP2 Selectively Promotes the Accumulation of a Subset of Ubiquitin Fusion Degradation Substrates in Live Cells—We took advantage of a panel of UPS sensors to report the CLD-mediated modulation of various facets of UPS activity. To evaluate the effect of CLD on the ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of substrates in living cells, we measured in vivo the steady state levels of four UPS sensors in the presence and absence of CLD. The UPS sensors comprise the YFP reporter fused to various degradation signals of the UPS. The four UPS sensors employed are Ub-R-YFP, UbG76V-YFP, CD3-δ-YFP, and CL1-YFP. The Ub-R-YFP and UbG76V-YFP contain a ubiquitin moiety fused to YFP. The former is an N-end rule substrate, whose polyubiquitylation and degradation depends on the presence of a free N-terminal arginine residue, whereas the mutation G76V of ubiquitin in UbG76V-YFP prevents its deubiquitylation and uses the ubiquitin moiety as a template for polyubiquitylation (59Lindsten K. Menendez-Benito V. Masucci M.G. Dantuma N.P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 60Menendez-Benito V. Verhoef L.G. Masucci M.G. Dantuma N.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2787-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The UbG76V-YFP and Ub-R-YFP constructs reflect the degradation of properly folded substrates. The CD3-δ-YFP measures the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway, because the T-cell receptor subunit is an endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation substrate (60Menendez-Benito V.

The CL1-YFP comprises the fusion of YFP to a short degron with a bulky hydrophobic motif resembling a misfolded domain (60Menendez-Benito V. Verhoef L.G. Masucci M.G. Dantuma N.P. Hum. Mol.

The CL1-YFP generates an unstable YFP and reports the degradation of misfolded proteins by the UPS (60Menendez-Benito V. Verhoef L.G. Masucci M.G. Dantuma N.P. Hum. Mol.

Finally, we also generated a sensor of UPS-independent proteolytic activity, GFP-DE, where GFP is fused to residues 422 to 461 of the degradation and PEST-containing domain of the mouse ornithine decarboxylase (62Li X.

Mouse ornithine decarboxylase is degraded in a UPS-independent fashion (62Li X. Zhao X. Fang Y. Jiang X. Duong T. Fan C. Huang C.C. Kain S.R. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 1, expression of CLD fused to the monomeric red fluorescent protein (RFP-CLD), but not RFP alone, had a strong and selective impact on the in vivo accumulation of Ub-R-YFP and UbG76V-YFP, but not on any other sensors tested. The highest effect was observed with UbG76V-YFP. These data support that the CLD selectively suppresses the activity of the UPS on properly folded substrates, because accumulation of all other substrate sensors failed to respond to CLD. Functional Analysis of the Flanking Domains, Ran-binding Domain-3 (RBD3) and Internal Repeat-1+2 (IR1+2), of CLD of RanBP2, in the Modulation of the UPS Activity—The CLD of RanBP2 is flanked by the upstream RBD3 and the downstream IR1+2 domains (Fig. 2A). The former is known to associate with Ran-GTP, whereas the latter interacts with the E2-ligase, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme-9 (ubc9) (46Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F.

We confirmed these results with pulldown assays using GST-RBD3-CLD constructs with or without the flanking domain, IR1+2, and CHAPS-solubilized retinal extracts. As shown in Fig. 2B, deletion of IR1+2 did not affect the GTP-dependent association of RanGTPase (lower panel), but it completely abrogated the binding activity of ubc9 to RBD3-CLD domains independently of the absence and presence of nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogs (upper panel). To evaluate the effect of RBD3 and IR1+2 domains on the activity of CLD toward the UPS in living cells, we followed the steady-state levels of the UPS sensor, UbG76V-YFP, in the presence of CLD constructs with or without its flanking domains (Fig. 2A).

https://openalex.org/W1983202560,"Cells must give the right response to each stimulus they receive. Scaffolding, a signaling process mediated by scaffold proteins, participates in the decoding of the cues by specifically directing signal transduction. The aim of this paper is to describe the molecular mechanisms of scaffolding, i.e. the principles by which scaffold proteins drive a specific response of the cell. Since similar scaffold proteins are found in many species, they evolved according to the purpose of each organism. This means they require adaptability. In the usual description of the mechanisms of scaffolding, scaffold proteins are considered as reactors where molecules involved in a cascade of reactions are simultaneously bound with the right orientation to meet and interact. This description is not realistic: (i) it is not verified by experiments and (ii) timing and orientation constraints make it complex which seems to contradict the required adaptability. A scaffold protein, Ste5, is used in the MAPK pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the cell to provide a specific response to stimuli. The massive amount of data available for this pathway makes it ideal to investigate the actual mechanisms of scaffolding. Here, a complete treatment of the chemical reactions allows the computation of the distributions of all the proteins involved in the MAPK pathway when the cell receives various cues. These distributions are compared to several experimental results. It turns out that the molecular mechanisms of scaffolding are much simpler and more adaptable than previously thought in the reactor model. Scaffold proteins bind only one molecule at a time. Then, their membrane recruitment automatically drives specific, amplified and localized signal transductions. The mechanisms presented here, which explain how the membrane recruitment of a protein can produce a drastic change in the activity of cells, are generic and may be commonly used in many biological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2014354821,"Metal-catalyzed oxidation reactions target amino acids in the metal binding pocket of proteins. Such oxidation reactions generally result in either preferential degradation of the protein or accumulation of a catalytically inactive pool of protein with age. Consistently, levels of oxidized proteins have been shown to increase with age. The segmental, progeroid disorder Werner syndrome results from loss of the Werner syndrome protein (WRN). WRN is a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases and possesses exonuclease and ATP-dependent helicase activities. Furthermore, each of the helicase and exonuclease domains of WRN contains a metal binding pocket. In this report we examined for metal-catalyzed oxidation of WRN in the presence of iron or copper. We found that WRN was oxidized in vitro by iron but not by copper. Iron-mediated oxidation resulted in the inhibition of both WRN helicase and exonuclease activities. Oxidation of WRN also inhibited binding to several known protein partners. In addition, we did not observe degradation of oxidized WRN by the 20 S proteasome in vitro. Finally, exposure of cells to hydrogen peroxide resulted in oxidation of WRN in vivo. Therefore, our results demonstrate that WRN undergoes metal-catalyzed oxidation in the presence of iron, and iron-mediated oxidation of WRN likely results in the accumulation of a catalytically inactive form of the protein, which may contribute to age-related phenotypes.

Many age-related changes are proposed to be a consequence of oxidative damage. Reactive oxygen species react with all three of the major cellular macromolecules: nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins. Many of the reactions mediated by reactive oxygen species result in the introduction of carbonyl groups to amino acid side chains in the protein, and the steady-state level of carbonyl-containing proteins increases exponentially during the last third of animal life spans (1Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), so that half of all proteins may become oxidized in an 80-year-old human (2Stadtman E.R. Berlett B.S. Drug Metab. Rev. 1998; 30: 225-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Within the protein, either the peptide or the side chain may be targeted. The protein may be cleaved to yield lower molecular weight products, or it may be cross-linked to give higher molecular weight species (1Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These reactions are frequently influenced by redox cycling metal cations, especially iron or copper. Both copper and iron are ubiquitous metals within the cell and are present in many enzymes and proteins. As transition elements, their ionic forms are prone to one-electron transfer reactions and thus enable iron and copper to generate radical species (3Meneghini R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). For example, copper and iron participate in the Fenton reaction, in which the very reactive hydroxyl radical is generated. Compared with copper, the abundance of iron and the availability of loosely bound iron makes it the more likely source of hydroxyl radicals in biological systems (4Sandstrom B.E. Granstrom M. Marklund S.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 16: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 5Mello-Filho A.C. Meneghini R. Mutat. Res. 1991; 251: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Metal-catalyzed oxidation is a site-specific process in which only one or a few amino acids in the metal binding site of a protein are preferentially oxidized (6Stadtman E.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). For example, kinases and other nucleotide-binding proteins with manganese or magnesium requirements are predictably oxidized in a site-specific fashion (7Fucci L. Oliver C.N. Coon M.J. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). As with low molecular weight chelators, iron and copper bind to divalent cation sites with an affinity that is orders of magnitude greater than manganese or magnesium, thus explaining why even submicromolar concentrations of iron or copper can out-compete magnesium or manganese (8Stadtman E.R. Levine R.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 899: 191-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The biological significance of metal-catalyzed oxidation reactions is that oxidatively modified proteins are often targeted for degradation, and failure to remove the modified proteins creates an intracellular pool of catalytically inactive or less active proteins, such as occurs with age (6Stadtman E.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Werner syndrome is a disorder characterized by premature aging. Werner syndrome patients appear much older than their chronological age and display many clinical features of normal aging, including cataracts, graying and thinning of the hair, type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, and an increased incidence of sarcomas (9Epstein C.J. Martin G.M. Schultz A.L. Motulsky A.G. Medicine (Baltimore). 1966; 45: 177-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Consistent with an aging phenotype, cells from Werner syndrome patients also have elevated levels of oxidized proteins (10Oliver C.N. Ahn B.W. Moerman E.J. Goldstein S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5488-5491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene mutated in Werner syndrome encodes a 1432-amino acid protein, WRN (Werner syndrome protein), 3The abbreviations used are:WRNWerner syndrome proteinTRF2telomere repeat-binding factor 2DNPdinitrophenylDTTdithiothreitolKuKu70/Ku80 heterodimerPARP-1poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1PBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albumin. 3The abbreviations used are:WRNWerner syndrome proteinTRF2telomere repeat-binding factor 2DNPdinitrophenylDTTdithiothreitolKuKu70/Ku80 heterodimerPARP-1poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1PBSphosphate-buffered salineBSAbovine serum albumin. belonging to the human RecQ family of DNA helicases. Specifically, RecQ members belong to the SF2 superfamily of helicases, which contain a set of seven conserved motifs (11Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 12Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1849-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Motifs I and II (Walker A and B boxes) contain amino acid residues important for ATP and metal binding (13Fry D.C. Chubby S.A. Mildvan A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 907-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In addition to ATP-dependent helicase activity, WRN is unique among human RecQ family members in that it also possesses exonuclease activity. The exonuclease domain comprises three motifs (Exo I, Exo II, and Exo III) characteristic of the RNase D family of DNA proofreading enzymes (14Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). A protease-resistant core exonuclease domain (amino acids 38–236) of WRN was recently crystallized (15Perry J.J. Yannone S.M. Holden L.G. Hitomi C. Asaithamby A. Han S. Cooper P.K. Chen D.J. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The crystal structure reveals that two metal ions are bound in the active site (15Perry J.J. Yannone S.M. Holden L.G. Hitomi C. Asaithamby A. Han S. Cooper P.K. Chen D.J. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), consistent with previously published alignments (14Mian I.S.

A. 1997; 94: 5831-5836Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In fact, the metal binding pocket of the WRN exonuclease domain is able to accommodate two magnesium (Mg2+), two manganese (Mn2+), or two lanthanide (Eu3+) ions (15Perry J.J. Yannone S.M. Holden L.G. Hitomi C. Asaithamby A. Han S. Cooper P.K. Chen D.J. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Werner syndrome protein telomere repeat-binding factor 2 dinitrophenyl dithiothreitol Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin Werner syndrome protein telomere repeat-binding factor 2 dinitrophenyl dithiothreitol Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin WRN requires divalent metals for catalytic activity, and metal-catalyzed oxidation usually impairs or abolishes the catalytic activity of enzymes (7Fucci L. Oliver C.N. Coon M.J. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Thus, oxidative modification of WRN would likely impair both helicase and exonuclease activities. Because the cellular accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins increases during aging (1Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) the net result would be a decrease in WRN activity, which could contribute to the aging phenotype. We therefore examined the susceptibility of WRN to metal-catalyzed oxidation and then the ability of oxidatively modified WRN to function catalytically, to interact with other proteins, as well as its susceptibility to degradation by the proteasome. Materials—Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. Cupric chloride (copper, Cu2+) and ferric chloride (iron, Fe3+) were from Sigma. Recombinant human WRN was purified as described previously (17Orren D.K. Brosh Jr., R.M. Nehlin J.O. Machwe A. Gray M.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3557-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), except that bovine serum albumin (BSA) and glycerol were omitted from the final storage buffer. Recombinant human TRF2 (telomere repeat binding factor 2) was purified as described previously (18Opresko P.L. von Kobbe C. Laine J.P. Harrigan J. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41110-41119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer (Ku) was a gift from Dr. Dale Ramsden (Chapel Hill, NC) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) was a gift from Dr. Gilbert de Murcia (Strasbourg, France). The 20 S proteasome was purified from rat liver and assayed as described (19Di Noto L. Whitson L.J. Cao X. Hart P.J. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39907-39913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein Oxidation Reactions—Purified recombinant WRN (500 ng) was incubated in oxidation buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) in the absence or presence of iron (2–50 μm) or copper (2–50 μm, Fig. 1 only) in a final volume of 20 μl for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 2 μl of 22 mm EDTA (2 mm final). Oxidized WRN was then used for determination of carbonyl content or enzymatic activity assays as described below. Protein Carbonyl Detection—Protein carbonyl groups were detected using the OxyBlot protein oxidation detection kit (Intergen, now Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, aliquots (5 μl) from protein oxidation reactions (∼115 ng of WRN) were incubated with 12% SDS (5 μl) and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (10 μl) for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, neutralization solution (7.5 μl) was added. Alternatively, 5 μl of mitochondrial extract (1 μg/μl) was derivatized as described above. Samples were then analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 2.5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-dinitrophenyl (DNP) antibodies (Dako, 1:1000). After washing with PBS-T, the membrane was incubated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, 1:10,000) for 1 h at room temperature. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were stripped (62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C) and reprobed with mouse anti-WRN antibodies (BD Biosciences, 1:250). For quantitative immunodetection, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-DNP antibodies (Dako, 1:2000), mouse anti-WRN antibodies (BD Biosciences, 1:400), or anti-DNP and anti-WRN antibodies. After washing with PBS-T, we employed either Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, 1:10,000) or IRDye 800 goat anti-mouse (LI-COR Biosciences, 1:10,000) secondary antibodies labeled with dyes that fluoresce in the infrared region. Fluorescence was measured with an infrared laser imager (Odyssey, LI-COR Biosciences). Unoxidized WRN served as the protein standard and oxidatively modified glutamine synthetase with known carbonyl content served as the carbonyl standard (20Luo S. Wehr N.B. Levine R.L. Anal. Biochem. 2006; 350: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation Assays—HeLa cells were pretreated for 1 h in the absence or presence of MG-132 (20 μm) in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing only glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin). Subsequently, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 250 μm hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for an additional hour. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped, and pelleted. Whole cell extracts were prepared by incubating cells in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin) for 30 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads for 10 min at 4 °C. Extracts were incubated with either rabbit anti-WRN (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was added to each sample and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged and washed four times with lysis buffer. Bound proteins were derivatized as described above except that 10 μl of 12% SDS, 20 μl of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, and 15 μl of neutralization solution were used. Samples were eluted by boiling for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using mouse anti-WRN antibodies (BD Biosciences, 1:250) or goat anti-DNP antibodies (Sigma, 1:500). Helicase Assays—Oligonucleotide 22Fork 3 (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGAGTGTGGTGTACATGCACTAC-3′) was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and annealed to its complementary strand, 22Fork 4 (5′-GTAGTGCATGTACACCACACTCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′). Reactions (20 μl) were performed in helicase reaction buffer (40 mm Tris (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 0.1 μg/μl BSA) and contained DNA substrate (50 fmol), 2 mm ATP, and WRN (1.5 μl of a 1:10 dilution from the oxidation reaction as described above). Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of stop dye (16 mm EDTA, 0.3% SDS, 13% glycerol, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). Reaction products were run on a 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, visualized using a PhosphorImager, and quantitated using ImageQuant software. ATPase Assays—ATPase reactions (10 μl) were performed in helicase reaction buffer containing M13mp18 DNA cofactor (150 ng), [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi), ATP (50 μm), and WRN (2 μl from the oxidation reaction described above, 279 fmol of WRN). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA. Samples were separated on a polyethylenimine/cellulose thin layer chromatography plate (Mallinckrodt Baker, Inc.) and developed in 1 m formic acid/0.8 m LiCl. Radioactive products were visualized using a PhosphorImager and quantitated using ImageQuant software. Exonuclease Assays—Oligonucleotide 34Fork A (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGCATGCACTAC-3′) was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and annealed to its complementary strand 34Fork B (5′-GTAGTGCATGCCCTAACCCTAACCCTAACCCTAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′). Exonuclease reactions (10 μl) were performed in helicase reaction buffer containing DNA substrate (25 fmol), 2 mm ATP, and WRN (2 μl of a 1:10 dilution from the oxidation reaction described above). Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of formamide stop dye (80% formamide, 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Reaction products were heat denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, run on a 14% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, visualized using a PhosphorImager, and quantitated using ImageQuant software. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed as described previously (21von Kobbe C. Harrigan J.A. May A. Opresko P.L. Dawut L. Cheng W.H. Bohr V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8601-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 fmol of Ku, PARP-1, or TRF2 was diluted in carbonate buffer and coated onto wells overnight at 4 °C. Wells were washed and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS, 2% BSA, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at 37 °C. Aliquots (3.5 μl, 500 fmol of WRN) from oxidation reactions were then added to the corresponding wells in a buffer containing PBS, 2% BSA, and 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Wells were incubated with rabbit anti-WRN antibodies (Novus Biologicals, 1:1000) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, 1:10,000) for 1 h at 37 °C. Bound WRN was detected with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride followed by termination with 3 m H2SO4. Absorbance was read at 490 nm. We first determined whether WRN underwent metal-catalyzed oxidation in vitro. We incubated purified recombinant WRN and DTT in the absence or presence of 25 μm copper or iron for up to 180 min. As shown in Fig. 1, WRN was not oxidized by copper during a 180-min incubation period (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lanes 2–6). Mitochondrial extracts served as a positive control for protein carbonyls (Fig. 1A, lane 8). Membranes were then stripped and reprobed with anti-WRN antibodies. Full-length WRN was observed in all lanes (Fig. 1A, lower panel, lanes 1–7). In addition, a slower migrating band was observed after a 180-min incubation in the presence of copper and DTT, indicative of protein cross-links or aggregates resulting from protein oxidation (Fig. 1A, lower panel, lane 6). However, as mentioned above, no signal was observed with anti-carbonyl antibodies (Fig. 1A, upper panel, lane 6), suggesting a limited amount of carbonyl groups or other forms of oxidation. In contrast to the results observed with copper, we observed a strong anti-carbonyl signal after incubation of WRN with iron and DTT for 30 min (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 2). Notably, the anti-carbonyl signal shifted to a higher molecular weight compared with the 0-min time point (Fig. 1B, upper panel, compare lanes 1 and 2). The anti-carbonyl signal was lost with longer incubation times (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 3–6), which also corresponded to a loss of WRN protein (lower panel, lanes 3–6). The loss of WRN required iron, as WRN was observed in the presence of DTT alone after 180 min (Fig. 1B, lower panel, lane 7). Extensive oxidative modification of proteins is known to cause aggregation (Fig. 1C), which can eventually yield proteins that are SDS-insoluble (1Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and explain the loss of WRN observed here. Because metal-catalyzed oxidation of WRN occurred within 30 min, but loss of WRN occurred at 60 min, we next took samples every 10 min over a 60-min time period. As shown in Fig. 1C, the anti-carbonyl signal increased at 10 min (upper panel, lane 2, note smear), was maximal after 30 min (upper panel, lane 4), and began to decrease by 40 min (upper panel, lane 5). WRN again shifted to a higher molecular weight product with incubation times between 10 and 40 min, with a maximal signal and shift at 30 and 40 min (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Thus, WRN undergoes iron-mediated metal-catalyzed oxidation. We next investigated the effect of iron concentration on the metal-catalyzed oxidation. WRN was incubated with 0–50 μm iron in the presence of DTT. As shown in Fig. 2A, increasing iron resulted in an increase in protein carbonyl in full-length WRN as well as higher molecular weight species detected with anti-carbonyl antibodies (left panel). Consistently, increasing iron resulted in a decrease in the full-length WRN form and an increase in shifted products (Fig. 2A, right panel). In addition, we incubated membranes either individually or simultaneously with anti-WRN and anti-carbonyl antibodies followed by incubation with fluorescent secondary antibody (Fig. 2B), allowing quantitation of protein carbonyl in WRN (Fig. 2C). Incubation with 50 μm iron resulted in ∼1 carbonyl group per WRN molecule. As protein carbonyls are only one measurement of protein oxidation, our results likely underestimate the extent of WRN oxidation. Metal-catalyzed oxidation within proteins is a caged free radical reaction that oxidizes amino acids at or near the metal binding pocket. As WRN contains metal binding pockets that are critical for catalytic activities, we next explored whether oxidation affects WRN helicase, ATPase, or exonuclease activities. WRN possesses seven conserved helicase motifs, which reside in the central portion of the protein (amino acids 545–740). The crystal structure of Escherichia coli RecQ shows a metal ion in the predicted ATP binding site in which the ion makes contacts with Ser-54 and Asp-146 of motifs I and II, respectively (22Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of metal-catalyzed oxidation on WRN helicase activity, we incubated recombinant WRN in the absence or presence of iron, terminated the oxidation reaction with EDTA, and subsequently performed unwinding assays. We observed that metal-catalyzed oxidation of WRN caused loss of helicase activity (Fig. 3A). Incubation of WRN with 10 or 25 μm iron inhibited WRN helicase activity 61 and 78%, respectively (Fig. 3A, right panel). As WRN helicase activity requires ATP hydrolysis, we next quantitated WRN ATPase activity following oxidation in the presence of iron. In contrast to the helicase assays, oxidation of WRN did not have as great an inhibitory effect on ATPase activity (Fig. 3B). Incubation of WRN with 10 and 25 μm iron inhibited WRN ATPase activity 9 and 41%, respectively (Fig. 3B, right panel). We next determined the effect of WRN exonuclease activity following metal-catalyzed oxidation in the presence of iron. The three exonuclease domains of WRN reside in the N terminus of the protein and the active site contains two metal ions (15Perry J.J. Yannone S.M. Holden L.G. Hitomi C. Asaithamby A. Han S. Cooper P.K. Chen D.J. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Similar to what was observed with WRN helicase assays, oxidation inhibited WRN exonuclease activity 46 and 72% in the presence of 10 and 25 μm iron, respectively (Fig. 3C, right panel). We added EDTA to stop reactive oxygen species generation after oxidation of WRN, but some reactive oxygen species might still have been produced during the subsequent enzyme assay. If so, they could oxidize the DNA, which was added as a substrate, and oxidized DNA has been shown to inhibit WRN exonuclease activity (23Machwe A. Ganunis R. Bohr V.A. Orren D.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2762-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined whether inhibition of WRN catalytic activity was the result of oxidation of the polypeptide itself or of the DNA substrate. We performed oxidation reactions in the absence of WRN and then added aliquots to helicase and exonuclease assays in the presence of unoxidized WRN. As shown in Fig. 3D, neither helicase nor exonuclease activities were modulated. We conclude that iron-catalyzed oxidation inhibits helicase and exonuclease activities through direct oxidation of WRN itself. Based on the inhibitory effects of oxidation on WRN catalytic activities, we next explored whether iron-mediated oxidation affects binding of WRN to its protein partners. We employed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to measure binding of WRN to Ku (Fig. 4A), PARP-1 (Fig. 4B), or TRF2 (Fig. 4C) following incubation in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of iron. Incubation of WRN with 10 or 25 μm iron inhibited binding of WRN to protein partners ∼25 and 50%, respectively (Fig. 4). Thus, oxidation of WRN in the presence of iron also inhibits binding of WRN to its protein partners. Protein oxidation typically perturbs the normal folding of the polypeptide. This misfolding may be recognized by the 20 S proteasome, which removes oxidatively modified proteins without ATP and without a requirement for ubiquitinylation (24Grune T. Merker K. Sandig G. Davies K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Thus, we measured the extent of WRN degradation by the 20 S proteasome following iron-mediated oxidation. Addition of the 20 S proteasome resulted in a slight degradation of WRN in the absence of iron (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2). However, incubation of WRN in the presence of increasing concentrations of iron and then subsequent incubation with the 20 S proteasome did not result in any further increased degradation (Fig. 5). Therefore, our results suggest that oxidized WRN is not targeted for degradation by the 20 S proteasome in vitro. Next we sought to determine whether WRN is oxidized in vivo and whether increased oxidative stress results in accumulation of oxidatively modified protein. Therefore, we pretreated cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Subsequently, cells were exposed to H2O2. As shown in Fig. 6, both MG-132 and H2O2 treatment resulted in increased protein carbonyls, compared with untreated cells, as determined by anti-DNP antibodies (Input, lower panels). In addition, MG-132 or H2O2 treatment resulted in a lower molecular weight WRN species in immunoprecipitates compared with untreated cells (Fig. 6, upper left panel). Treatment of cells with MG-132 and H2O2 also resulted in a higher molecular weight WRN species in immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6, upper left panel). Furthermore, probing the WRN immunoprecipitates with anti-DNP antibodies resulted in increased protein carbonyl signals in samples exposed to MG-132 or H2O2 compared with untreated samples (Fig. 6, lower left panel). Thus, our results demonstrate that WRN can be modified oxidatively in vivo as determined by increased protein carbonyls following treatment of cells with H2O2 and proteasome inhibitor. Because purified 20 S proteasome did not initiate degradation of oxidatively modified WRN in vitro, other factors present in vivo are likely required. These could be an additional protease, a chaperone, or the regulatory cap present in the 26 S proteasome. The appearance of a lower molecular weight form of WRN following treatment with H2O2 or the proteasome inhibitor is consistent with a requirement for another protease to initiate degradation of WRN, as has been proposed for degradation of z-bands (25Williams A.B. Courten-Myers G.M. Fischer J.E. Luo G. Sun X. Hasselgren P.O. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1435-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In this report we have demonstrated that WRN undergoes metal-catalyzed oxidation in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in vitro. This reaction was mediated preferentially by iron, compared with copper. In addition, WRN was oxidized in vivo following exposure of cells to H2O2. Furthermore, we have shown that oxidative modification converts WRN to a form with impaired enzymatic activity and with impaired ability to participate in protein-protein interactions. Thus, cells that accumulate this post-translationally modified WRN could have functional defects similar to those observed in Werner syndrome patients, in which mutations in the WRN gene result in loss of WRN expression. Consistently, oxidative modification of fibrinogen has been shown previously to cause a functional impairment in clot formation akin to that seen in inherited dysfibrinogenemia (26Shacter E. Williams J.A. Levine R.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). WRN contains metal binding pockets within both ATPase/helicase and exonuclease motifs as mentioned previously. Thus, the specificity of the oxidative modification of WRN is understandable as metal-catalyzed oxidation is not a random event. It is site-specific as a consequence of the binding of divalent cations to metal binding site(s) within proteins (1Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 27Farber J.M. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4574-4578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Choudhary et al. (28Choudhary S. Sommers J.A. Brosh Jr., R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34603-34613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) found that iron and copper very effectively inhibited WRN helicase activity compared with other metals at the same concentration (10 μm). In addition, iron was more effective than copper in inhibiting WRN unwinding reactions at even lower concentrations. Consistently, we observed that iron-catalyzed oxidation of WRN resulted in inhibition of ATPase, helicase, and exonuclease activities to various extents. The relative preservation of WRN ATPase activity in the presence of iron is not surprising because the reaction it catalyzes is only one component of the overall helicase reaction. For WRN helicase and exonuclease activities, it may be that a greater fraction of helicase activity is lost compared with exonuclease activity at low iron concentrations. For example, in the presence of 10 μm iron, WRN helicase activity was inhibited 61%, whereas exonuclease activity was inhibited 46% (Fig. 3, A and C). The potential physiological or regulatory significance of such differential inhibition as a result of oxidation remains to be determined. Taken together, our observations that iron was more effective than copper in oxidizing WRN in vitro, and that iron-catalyzed oxidation of WRN resulted in decreased helicase and exonuclease activities, and the greater abundance and availability of intracellular iron, suggest that WRN is likely oxidized by iron in vivo and this oxidation will result in inhibition of the enzymatic activities of WRN. Similarly, mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ has been shown to be oxidized in vitro and in vivo (29Graziewicz M.A. Day B.J. Copeland W.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2817-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Oxidation of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase γ resulted in decreased polymerase activity, which may lead to decreased mitochondrial DNA replication and repair capabilities. As WRN has been suggested to participate in DNA replication, recombination, repair, and telomere maintenance, metal-catalyzed oxidation may inhibit the role of WRN in these processes, leading to genome instability. For example, WRN has been shown to physically interact with Ku (30Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar), and this interaction stimulates WRN exonuclease activity (30Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar, 31Karmakar P. Snowden C.M. Ramsden D.A. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3583-3591Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Li B. Comai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9896-9902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The participation of Ku in the repair of DNA double strand breaks suggests that WRN may be important for DNA end processing during repair events. Ku has also been localized to telomeres (33Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and the interaction between Ku and WRN may be important for telomere maintenance. Similarly, WRN has been shown to interact physically with the telomere repeat-binding protein TRF2, and TRF2 stimulates WRN helicase activity, lending further support to a role for WRN at telomeres (18Opresko P.L. von Kobbe C. Laine J.P. Harrigan J. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41110-41119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). WRN also physically interacts with PARP-1 (21von Kobbe C. Harrigan J.A. May A. Opresko P.L. Dawut L. Cheng W.H. Bohr V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8601-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, Werner syndrome cells are deficient in the PARP-1 poly-(ADP-ribosyl)ation pathway after oxidative stress (21von Kobbe C. Harrigan J.A. May A. Opresko P.L. Dawut L. Cheng W.H. Bohr V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8601-8613Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for WRN in repair of oxidative DNA damage. Iron-mediated oxidation of WRN resulted in decreased binding to its protein partners, Ku, TRF2, and PARP-1, suggesting that oxidatively modified WRN may have deleterious effects on DNA repair and telomere maintenance pathways. In yeast, aging is accompanied by increased genome instability, for example in the form of loss of heterozygosity (34McMurray M.A. Gottschling D.E. Science. 2003; 301: 1908-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Age-induced loss of heterozygosity may result from an age-dependent increase in DNA double strand breaks and/or a decrease in the repair of such breaks (34McMurray M.A. Gottschling D.E. Science. 2003; 301: 1908-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As oxidized proteins accumulate preferentially in old yeast cells (35Aguilaniu H. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Nystrom T. Science. 2003; 299: 1751-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), it is possible that old cells accumulate damaged proteins, resulting in decreased DNA repair (36Sinclair D.A. Science. 2003; 301: 1859-1860Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Our results presented here suggest that oxidatively modified WRN is refractory to degradation by the proteasome. Thus, increased oxidative stress in old cells may result in increased WRN oxidation and accumulation of catalytically inactive pools of WRN, promoting inefficient DNA repair and genome instability. Although Werner syndrome is clinically notable for its phenotype of premature aging, cells from patients with Werner syndrome were shown to carry an increased burden of oxidatively damaged proteins well before WRN was recognized to be a DNA helicase and exonuclease (10Oliver C.N.

Recently, Werner syndrome patients were also shown to have elevated levels of oxidative stress parameters (39Pagano G. Zatterale A. Degan P. d'Ischia M. Kelly F.J. Pallardo F.V. Calzone R. Castello G. Dunster C. Giudice A. Kilinc Y. Lloret A. Manini P. Masella R. Vuttariello E. Warnau M. Free Radic. Res. 2005; 39: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), providing additional evidence of an in vivo prooxidant state. As in Werner syndrome, tissues from mice lacking ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) are also under oxidative stress (40Barlow C. Dennery P.A. Shigenaga M.K. Smith M.A. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Wynshaw-Boris A. Levine R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9915-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). ATM is a protein kinase that becomes activated following the formation of double-stranded DNA breaks. The mechanisms by which a defective response to DNA damage leads to oxidative stress are unknown, as are the mechanisms by which oxidative stress increases during aging. However, the ability of oxidative stress to inactivate DNA repair enzymes such as WRN could give rise to a self-amplifying “vicious cycle.” Oxidative inactivation of a fraction of WRN could thus increase oxidative stress, driving the cycle at an increasingly accelerated rate.

https://openalex.org/W2119480374,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of MMPs), are two protein families that work together to remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM). TIMPs serve not only to inhibit MMP activity, but also aid in the activation of MMPs that are secreted as inactive zymogens. Xenopus laevis metamorphosis is an ideal model for studying MMP and TIMP expression levels because all tissues are remodeled under the control of one molecule, thyroid hormone. Here, using RT-PCR analysis, we examine the metamorphic RNA levels of two membrane-type MMPs (MT1-MMP, MT3-MMP), two TIMPs (TIMP-2, TIMP-3) and a potent gelatinase (Gel-A) that can be activated by the combinatory activity of a MT-MMP and a TIMP. In the metamorphic tail and intestine the RNA levels of TIMP-2 and MT1-MMP mirror each other, and closely resemble that of Gel-A as all three are elevated during periods of cell death and proliferation. Conversely, MT3-MMP and TIMP-3 do not have similar RNA level patterns nor do they mimic the RNA levels of the other genes examined. Intriguingly, TIMP-3, which has been shown to have anti-apoptotic activity, is found at low levels in tissues during periods of apoptosis."

This was taken to suggest that transhydrogenase operates by an “alternating-sites” mechanism in which the two dI-dII-dIII monomers run 180° out-of-phase during catalytic turnover. Consistent with this, earlier work had indicated half-of-the-sites inhibition of bovine transhydrogenase by covalent modifiers (21Phelps D.C. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3503-3507Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22Phelps D.C. Hatefi Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4475-4480Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The alternating sites mechanism requires that events in the two dI-dII-dIII monomers are coordinated; there must be a coupling of conformational changes across the dimer interface. In this report, we describe the effects of substituting invariant Tyr146, a residue which is centrally located in the dimer interface between the two dI components of R. rubrum transhydrogenase (see Fig. 1). Tyr146 lies on helix α6, one of the two helices that link domains dI.1 and dI.2; the side chain of the residue makes H-bond contact with the carbonyl group of Phe160 at the junction between the C terminus of α6 and the N terminus of the “β-hairpin” in the symmetry-related partner polypeptide. The x-ray structures suggest that, during alternation of the sites, the β-hairpin shifts position and dI.1 rotates against dI.2; the pivot for rotation is in α6 close to Tyr146, and in α11 (20Bhakta T.

The rotation causes a change in the conformation of the “RQD” loop, and this shifts the position of the nicotinamide ring of NADH which thus gates the hydride-transfer reaction. In all conformationally coupled pumps like transhydrogenase, Ca2+-ATPase, FoF1-ATPase, and the ABC transporters, gating steps are necessary to prevent slip, e.g. translocation in the absence of the chemical reaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESWild-type dI and wild-type dIII from R. rubrum transhydrogenase were expressed from the plasmids, pCD1 (23Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and pNIC2 (24Jeeves M. Smith K.J. Quirk P.G. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 305-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), respectively, in appropriate strains of Escherichia coli after induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, as described in the earlier reports. The dI was purified on three consecutive chromatography columns, Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare), Butyl Toyopearl (Tosohaas), and Q-Sepharose High Performance (GE Healthcare), essentially as described (23Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Bizouarn T. Grimley R.L. Diggle C. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The dIII was purified sequentially on Q-Sepharose Fast Flow, Q-Sepharose High Performance and Butyl Toyopearl, essentially as described (26Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCD1 was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange kit and DNA primers supplied by Alta-Bioscience. The resulting new plasmids, pUMO1 and pGVB5, encoded dI.Y146F and dI.Y146A, respectively. The plasmid encoding dIE7 was constructed by PCR using pCD1 as a template, and primers that included a coding sequence for the 7-Glu tag. A NdeI-KpnI fragment containing the dIE7 construct was excised from the PCR product, cloned into pET-Duet-1 (Novogen), and designated pTHB31. The DNA of all three plasmids was sequenced to confirm that no errors were introduced by the PCR. The plasmids were then used to transform cells of either E. coli C600, in the case of pUMO1 and pGVB5, or E. coli BL21(DE3), in the case of pTHB31. The cells were grown, induced, harvested, frozen, thawed, and disrupted, as described for the production of wild-type dI. The dIE7 protein was purified using the procedure described for wild-type dI. Only small amounts of dI.Y146A and dI.Y146F were found in the soluble fraction of the induced E. coli cells; rather more was associated with cellular inclusion bodies. The inclusion body fraction was, therefore, used as a starting point for isolation of these two mutant proteins. All operations were carried out at 4 °C. After cell breakage, the lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was re-suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and re-centrifuged. The pellet from this operation was resuspended in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, incubated for 30 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The denatured proteins were refolded by extensive dialysis of the supernatant against 30 mm Na-Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 15% (v/v) glycerol. The dialyzed material was subjected to chromatography on Butyl Toyopearl (see above). Pooled fractions containing the mutant dI proteins were supplemented with 25% (v/v) glycerol and stored at -15 °C. On the basis of stain intensity with Page Blue 83 on SDS-PAGE, the protein was >95% pure. To confirm that dI completely refolds under the conditions described, the guanidinium hydrochloride denaturation and subsequent steps were performed with purified wild-type protein. The appearance of the resulting protein on SDS-PAGE was unchanged relative to that from the conventional preparation. It was fully active in reconstitution assays, and the very short wavelength fluorescence emission spectrum was preserved (23Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the microtannin procedure (27Mejbaum-Katzenellenbogen S. Drobryszycka W.J. Clin. Chem. Acta. 1959; 4: 515-522Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, dI concentrations are given as monomers. Before use, proteins were thawed on ice and either used directly or concentrated in Vivaspin centrifugal filters with a molecular weight cut-off of 10 kDa for dI and 5 kDa for dIII.R. rubrum was grown under photosynthetic conditions and everted membrane vesicles (chromatophores) were prepared and stored as described (28Cunningham I.J.

The bacteriochlorophyll concentration of the vesicles was measured using the in vivo extinction coefficient of 140 mm-1 cm-1 at 880 nm (30Clayton R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 73: 312-323Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar).Transhydrogenation rates in R. rubrum membranes were measured in the “reverse” direction (compare Reaction 1) as the reduction of acetyl pyridine adenine dinucleotide (AcPdAD+) 2The abbreviations used are:AcPdAD+acetyl pyridine adenine dinucleotideMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. (an analogue of NAD+) by NADPH at 375 nm (ϵ = 6.1 mm-1 cm-1) on a Shimadzu UV-2401 spectrophotometer. Low concentrations of carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone were added to the assay buffer to prevent build-up of an unfavorable proton electrochemical gradient (see figure legends). “Cyclic transhydrogenation” in dI2dIII1 complexes was measured as the reduction of AcPdAD+ by NADH, utilizing the tightly bound NADP+ that results from the standard purification procedure of dIII.Trp fluorescence was measured using a Spex FluoroMax. Isothermal titration calorimetry was carried out using a MicroCal VP-ITC, and data were analyzed using ORIGIN software, as previously described (15Venning J.D. Rodrigues D.J. Weston C.J.

Differential scanning calorimetry was performed with a MicroCal VP-DSC, again using ORIGIN for analysis. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-810 polarimeter purged with dry nitrogen. One dimensional 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX500 equipped with a cryoprobe. Pulse and collect spectra with water pre-saturation were acquired using 11 ppm spectral width and comprised 256 transients with a total acquisition time of 11 min. Analytical ultracentrifuge experiments were carried out using an 8-piece An-60 Ti rotor in a Beckman-Optima XL-I using either absorbance or interference optics, as described in the figure legends. A 2-sector cell was used in the sedimentation velocity experiments, and a 6-sector cell in the sedimentation equilibrium experiments. Sedimentation velocity data were analyzed using the continuous c(s) distribution method in the SEDFIT program (31Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium data were fitted using both the Beckman XL-I software, implemented in ORIGIN, and the SEDPHAT program (32Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, amino acid residues are specified for the R. rubrum transhydrogenase according to the numbering system described (16Cotton N.P.J. White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S.

However, the dI of R. rubrum transhydrogenase exists as a separate polypeptide. In currently available gene sequences the R. rubrum-like organization is, in fact, the most common (13Wilson R. Obiozo U.M. Quirk P.G. Besra G.D. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophy. Acta. 2006; 1537: 215-223Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The dI can be removed from inverted membrane vesicles of R. rubrum simply by centrifugation washing in the absence of NADP(H) (28Cunningham I.J. Williams R. Palmer T. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Fisher R.R. Guillory R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4679-4686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); activity is restored to the dII/dIII components in the depleted membranes by adding recombinant dI (26Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Freshly purified dI.Y146F was almost as effective as wild-type dI in restoring transhydrogenation activity: the maximal rate of reaction with the mutant was ∼80% that with wild type, and the concentrations of protein required to achieve the half-maximal rates were similar, 5 nm for dI.Y146F and 3.5 nm for wild-type dI (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, much higher concentrations of dI.Y146A were needed to produce an increase in the rate of transhydrogenation with dI-depleted membranes; the maximal rate was not reached at >15 μm mutant protein (Fig. 2). In a complementary series of experiments, dI-depleted membranes were supplemented with a fixed concentration of wild-type dI (enough to restore activity to ∼67%) together with a variable concentration of dI.Y146A (Fig. 2). Low concentrations of the mutant dI led to inhibition of the transhydrogenase reaction originating from the wild-type enzyme. Even concentrations of dI.Y146A, which in the absence of wild-type dI had barely any restorative effect on transhydrogenation, caused substantial inhibition.FIGURE 2Restoration of transhydrogenase activity in dI-depleted R. rubrum membranes with dI.Y146A. Assay mixtures contained 50 mm Na-MOPS, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, dI-depleted R. rubrum membranes (10.5 μm bacteriochlorophyll), 200 μm NADPH, 3 μm carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxy phenylhydrazone, and either wild-type dI (•) or dI.Y146A (♦) at the concentration shown. The reaction was initiated with 200 μm AcPdAD+. An equivalent set of the data for wild-type dI is shown in supplemental Fig. S1 on an expanded scale. ⋄, assays in similar conditions except that 40 nm wild-type dI was present throughout, and the concentration of dI.Y146A was varied as shown on the bottom axis. T = 25 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A complex comprising two polypeptides of dI and one polypeptide of dIII (the dI2dIII1 complex) forms with high affinity in mixtures of the two recombinant proteins. The rates of forward and reverse transhydrogenation catalyzed by the dI2dIII1 complex in steady state are extremely low because, in the absence of the membrane-spanning dII, the products NADPH and NADP+, respectively, remain very tightly bound to dIII. However, the dI2dIII1 complex catalyzes a high rate of “cyclic transhydrogenation” in which tightly-bound NADP+ is reduced by NADH, and the resulting tightly-bound NADPH is re-oxidized by AcPdAD+ (26Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The addition of fresh dI.Y146F to a solution of dIII led to the formation of complexes capable of performing cyclic transhydrogenation at ∼70% of the rate of wild-type complexes. The dependence on protein concentration was similar to that obtained with wild-type dI: ∼40 nm of wild-type dI, and 45 nm dI.Y146F gave half-maximal rates of reaction with 20 nm dIII (supplemental Fig. S2). However, in close parallel to the results of the experiments on membranes, much higher concentrations of dI.Y146A were required to give catalytically active complexes, and the reaction did not reach its maximal rate even when >20 μm mutant protein was added (Fig. 3). Experiments were also performed to investigate whether dI.Y146A can compete with wild-type dI in the formation of complexes with dIII. Thus, a fixed concentration of wild-type dI (enough to give 46% of the maximum rate) was added to dIII together with a variable concentration of dI.Y146A (Fig. 3). The rate of cyclic transhydrogenation was inhibited by dI.Y146A. The inhibitory effect was evident even at concentrations of the mutant which barely supported transhydrogenation in the absence of wild-type dI.FIGURE 3Transhydrogenase activity in complexes of dIII and either wild-type dI or dI.Y146A. Assay mixtures contained 50 mm Na-MOPS, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 200 μm NADH, 20 nm dIII (bearing tightly bound NADP+), and either wild-type dI (•) or dI.Y146A (♦) at the concentration shown.

This decline was reflected in changes in the protein fluorescence spectrum (see below). In marked contrast, wild-type dI and dI.Y146A in identical solution conditions remained stable for >2 days at 4 °C, and for >3 months at -15 °C.The Oligomeric State of Wild-type dI and dI.Y146A—By several criteria, isolated wild-type dI is a dimer in solution at concentrations >1 μm (15Venning J.D.

Tornroth S. Okvist M. Karlsson B.G. Rydstrom J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The dimer interfaces of the proteins from the two species are very similar. Loaded at a concentration of 12 μm, dI.Y146A from R. rubrum transhydrogenase ran with Mr ≈ 44 kDa on gel-permeation chromatography, whereas wild-type dI ran with Mr ≈ 84 kDa (supplemental Fig. S3). The Mr of the monomers from amino acid sequence is calculated to be ≈40.3 kDa.From the results of sedimentation velocity experiments on wild-type dI in the analytical ultracentrifuge, the relation between c(s) and S showed a single peak (at S = 3.75) independent of protein concentration in the range 3-12 μm (Fig. 4A). The c(M) distribution of the data yields Mr = 81 ± 7 kDa with a frictional ratio of 1.3. The results clearly show that wild-type dI is a dimer at these concentrations. However, the main peak in the c(s) versus S relation for dI.Y146A shifted from S = 3.0 to S = 3.6 as the protein concentration was increased from 3 to 12 μm, and a minor peak at S = 2.2 became evident at 12 μm protein (Fig. 4A). This behavior is characteristic of a monomerdimer equilibrium, which is in fast exchange on the time scale of the moving boundary. The results of sedimentation-equilibrium experiments on dI.Y146A were satisfactorily fitted by a monomer-dimer equilibrium with Kd ≈ 20 ± 3 μm (Fig. 4B). The presence of 200 μm NADH in sedimentation velocity experiments (using interference optics to circumvent problems because of the high absorbance of the nucleotide) had no significant effect on the relation between c(s) and S for wild-type dI in the concentration range 3-12 μm. However, NADH altered the profiles for dI.Y146A indicating a decreased rate of exchange between monomer and dimer, probably the result of a shift into the dimeric species (37Balbo A. Schuck P. Office of Research Services Web Site. 2006; dbeps.ors.od.nih.gov/pbr_AUC.htmGoogle Scholar). Fig. 4C shows data with 6 μm protein; results with 3 μm and 12 μm were similar in character.FIGURE 4Analytical ultracentrifuge analysis of wild-type dI and dI.Y146A.

At higher temperatures the change in heat capacity indicated exothermic protein aggregation. In experiments with dI.Y146A under similar conditions the Tm was appreciably lower (45.5 °C) but, again, higher temperatures led to exothermic protein aggregation. For both wild-type and mutant proteins, the Tm values were independent of protein concentration between 12 and 24 μm, and they were not affected by the presence of 200 μm NADH. The scans were not reversible even from temperatures just above (∼1 °C) the respective Tm.Fluorescence of Wild-type dI and Its Tyr146 Mutants: NADH Binding to dI—The dI component of R. rubrum transhydrogenase has a single Trp residue (at position 72) in the β-sheet of domain dI.1. The fluorescence emission spectrum of Trp72 has a remarkably short wavelength maximum at 308 nm and distinctive fine structure (23Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These features are attributable to the very rigid local environment of the indole side chain of this Trp (38Broos J.

https://openalex.org/W2083287556,"The role of transposable elements in sculpting the genome is well appreciated but remains poorly understood. Some organisms, such as humans, do not have active transposons; however, transposable elements were presumably active in their ancestral genomes. Of specific interest is whether the DNA surrounding the sites of transposon excision become recombinogenic, thus bringing about homologous recombination. Previous studies in maize and Drosophila have provided conflicting evidence on whether transposon excision is correlated with homologous recombination. Here we take advantage of an atypical Dissociation (Ds) element, a maize transposon that can be mobilized by the Ac transposase gene in Arabidopsis thaliana, to address questions on the mechanism of Ds excision. This atypical Ds element contains an adjacent 598 base pairs (bp) inverted repeat; the element was allowed to excise by the introduction of an unlinked Ac transposase source through mating. Footprints at the excision site suggest a micro-homology mediated non-homologous end joining reminiscent of V(D)J recombination involving the formation of intra-helix 3′ to 5′ trans-esterification as an intermediate, a mechanism consistent with previous observations in maize, Antirrhinum and in certain insects. The proposed mechanism suggests that the broken chromosome at the excision site should not allow recombinational interaction with the homologous chromosome, and that the linked inverted repeat should also be mobilizable. To test the first prediction, we measured recombination of flanking chromosomal arms selected for the excision of Ds. In congruence with the model, Ds excision did not influence crossover recombination. Furthermore, evidence for correlated movement of the adjacent inverted repeat sequence is presented; its origin and movement suggest a novel mechanism for the evolution of repeated elements. Taken together these results suggest that the movement of transposable elements themselves may not directly influence linkage. Possibility remains, however, for novel repeated DNA sequences produced as a consequence of transposon movement to influence crossover in subsequent generations."
