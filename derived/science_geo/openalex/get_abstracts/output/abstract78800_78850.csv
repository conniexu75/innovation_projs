https://openalex.org/W1970806795,"IT is considered that one of the theoretical advantages of systemic materials applied to roots or stems is the selective action against phytophagous pests without toxicity to their predators. This ecological selectivity was demonstrated by Ripper1, who found that bean plants dipped in a solution of dimefox were toxic to both aphids and predators, but when dimefox was applied as a root drench, aphids were killed and predators survived."

https://openalex.org/W4239053931,"WHEN it was known that the excretion of hydroxyproline peptides in the urine was correlated with active growth, and varied in a characteristic way with age1–3, Alison et al.4 demonstrated that as a measure of growth the ratio of hydroxyproline : creatinine in a 24 h collection of urine was a great improvement on the hydroxyproline excretion/24 h, because the former eliminated to a great extent the effects of weight, and gave more consistent results for subjects of the same age. They found that the ratio fell in children between 1 and 5 yr, and then remained constant until puberty, after which it fell again to the adult level. Jasin et al.1 had already introduced the factor of surface area to try to eliminate the effects of size, and had found that the results obtained were constant between the ages of 1 and 10 yr."

https://openalex.org/W2041715347,"I HAVE previously shown that a guanylhydrazone derivative of a known steroid molecule is a powerful antimitotic agent1. This compound, the structure of which is shown in Fig. 1, is 3-guanyl-hydrazone-androstan-17-ol; it is listed by the Italian pharmaceutical house Vister as 2052 V (Fig. 1)."
https://openalex.org/W2053803154,"ATRACTYLOSIDE is known to prevent the phosphorylation of exogenous ADP by intact liver mitochondria1, and to block the passage of adenine nucleotides across the mitochondrial membrane2–7. The question therefore arises as to whether or not these two effects of atractyloside are independent of each other."

https://openalex.org/W4253907161,"RECENT work by Furneaux1–3 represents certainly the most original contribution to the exact measurement of attributes of mental functioning for many decades. There is growing interest in the study of mental test performance in terms of individual items in precisely denned dimensions. It is unfortunate, however, but unavoidable, that the argument and symbolic expression used in the basic work have a forbidding complexity4. Not a little of the difficulty in following the development of Furneaux's argument is contributed by the first published paper1. In this paper a set of three fundamental equations was stated. These govern the probabilities of item solution, completion and error. All three equations appear to contain errors."
https://openalex.org/W2014530595,"THERE is no general answer to the question of the possible existence and function of a centrifugal pathway to the retina. Evidence for the presence of such a system in mammalian species is controversial, but Holden1 has pointed out that in the case of the pigeon there is substantial anatomical and physiological evidence for a centrifugal system. He goes on to suggest possible functions for such a pathway in mammals mediating known visual phenomena although Brindley2 has argued that there is little behavioural evidence for the necessity of such a pathway."
