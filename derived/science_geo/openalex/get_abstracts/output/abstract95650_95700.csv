https://openalex.org/W1979218266,"Emotional, psychosocial, or anxiety-stimulated stress produces increased plasma concentrations of adrenal corticoids and other hormones though well-known neuroendocrine pathways. A direct consequence of these increased corticoid concentrations is injury to elements of the immunological apparatus, which may leve the subject vulnerable to the action of latent oncogenic viruses, newly transformed cancer cells, or other incipient pathological processes that are normally held in check by an intact immunological apparatus. This article describes studies that examine the adverse effects of increased plasma concentrations of adrenal corticoids on the thymus and thymus-dependent T cells, inasmuch as these elements constitute a major defense system against various neoplastic processes and other pathologies. The studies demonstrate that anxiety-stress can be quantitatively induced and the consequences measured through specific biochemical and cellular parameters, providing that authentic quiescent baselines of these conditions are obtained in the experimental animals by the use of low-stress protective housing and handling techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2070230103,"A three-tone sinusoidal replica of a naturally produced utterance was identified by listeners, despite the readily apparent unnatural speech quality of the signal. The time-varying properties of these highly artificial acoustic signals are apparently sufficient to support perception of the linguistic message in the absence of traditional acoustic cues for phonetic segments."
https://openalex.org/W2079836599,"The ability of murine tumor cells to metastasize spontaneously from subcutaneous sites is positively correlated with the total sialic acid content of the cells in culture, the degree to which the sialic acid is exposed on the tumor cell surface, and, most strongly, with the degree of sialylation of galactosyl and N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues in cell surface glycoconjugates. These findings suggest that sialic acid on the cell surface may play a role in tumor cell metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2037990198,"Single-cell activity was recorded in the inferotemporal cortex of monkeys performing a task that requires perception and temporary retention of colored stimuli. Many cells reacted differentially to the stimuli. By changing the relevance of certain features of compound stimuli, it was found that the reactions of some cells to color depend critically on whether or not the task demands that the animal pay attention to color. A substantial number of cells showed color-dependent differences in frequency of discharge during the retention periods of the task. The temporal characteristics of differential discharge and its dissolution when memory is no longer required indicate that the cells that display it are involved in retaining visual information."
https://openalex.org/W2052218939,"Although lysosomal enzymes are implicated in the processes of tumor invasion and metastasis, their cellular origin within the tumor is unclear. The activity of the lysosomal proteinase cathepsin B is significantly elevated in a variant of the B16 melanoma with high metastatic potential. The cathepsin B activity is localized to the lysosomes of the tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2143057036,"Adjacent simple cells recorded and ""isolated"" simultaneously from the same microelectrode placement were usually tuned to the same orientation and spatial frequency. The responses of the members of these ""spatial frequency pairs"" to drifting sine-wave gratings were cross-correlates. Within the middle range of the spatial frequency selectivity curves, the responses of the paired cells differed in phase by approximately 90 percent. This phase relationship suggests that adjacent simple cells tuned to the same spatial frequency and orientation represent paired sine and cosine filters in terms of their processing of afferent spatial inputs and truncated sine and cosine filters in terms of the output of simple cells."

The active compounds isolated from the tunicate, didemnins A, B, and C, are depsipeptides, and didemnin B (a derivative of didemnin A) is the component active at the lowest concentration in inhibiting viral replication in vitro and P388 leukemia in vivo."

Contact points between bilayers were observed by freeze fracture electron microscopy, and isotropic molecular motional averaging was detected by phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance under fusion conditions. A molecular model of point defect structure is proposed as an intermediate stage of fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2054524095,"The molecularly cloned, long terminal repeat (LTR) of the Moloney sarcoma virus (M-MSV) provirus has been covalently linked to c-mos, the cellular homolog of the M-MSV-specific sequence, v-mos. These newly constructed clones lack any M-MSV-derived sequences other than the LTR, but in DNA transfection assays they transform cells as efficiently as cloned subgenomic M-MSV fragments containing both v-mos and LTR. Cells transformed by LTR:c-mos hybrid molecules contain additional copies of mos DNA, and several size classes of polyadenylated RNA's with sequence homology to mos. The activation of the transforming potential of c-mos by the proviral LTR suggests a model whereby LTR-like elements could activate other normal cell sequences with oncogenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W1987815123,"Exposure to a short photoperiod improved the thermogenic capacity, and cold resistance of Djungarian hamsters and increased the respiratory power of their brown adipose tissue. Exposure to a long photoperiod caused a decrease in thermogenic measurements. This thermotropic action of the short photoperiod was detectable only during late summer and fall. A similar thermotropic response could be elicited by implanting hamsters with melatonin, indicating that the pineal may be involved in photoperiodic control of thermoregulatory effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2033932219,"This study suggests one mechanism by which alveolar macrophages accumulate in the lung in pulmonary emphysema: elastin fragments generated at the diseased sites are potent chemoattractants for monocytes, the precursors of the macrophages. The most chemotactic elastin fragments have a molecular weight between 10,000 and 50,000 and are active at concentrations as low as 3 nanograms per milliliter. By comparison, elastin fragments with higher molecular weights and desmosines are active at concentrations greater than 0.3 microgram per milliliter. In addition, preincubation of monocytes with the 10,000- to 50,000-dalton elastin impairs the ability of the cells to migrate toward elastin fragments but not toward activated serum. Fragments of tropoelastin are not chemotactic for monocytes. Because elastin, but not tropoelastin, contains lysyl-derived cross-links, these structures may be the active chemotactic site on the elastin fragments."

https://openalex.org/W2076400820,Long-term potentiation of the hippocampal slice preparation results in an increase in the incorporation of labeled valine into the proteins destined for secretion into the extracellular medium. Double-labeling methods established that the increased secretion of the labeled proteins was limited to the potentiated region of a slice; incorporation of labeled valine was increased in the hippocampus if potentiation was through the Schaffer collaterals and in the dentate if potentiation was through the perforant path. Controls for nonspecific stimulation showed no changes. There appears to be a link between long-term potentiation and the metabolic processes that lead to protein synthesis in the hippocampal slice system.
https://openalex.org/W2093157034,"Plasma membranes isolated from the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani were enriched in acid phosphatase (E.C. 3.1.3.2) activity. Cytochemically, the enzyme was distributed uniformly on the surface of intact cells and was localized on the external face of isolated membranes. Physical characteristics and orientation of the membrane-bound enzyme suggest that the organism is adapted for existence in hydrolytic environments."
https://openalex.org/W2059730146,"Phosphatidate, a neuronal phospholipid, stimulated the uptake of calcium by nerve terminals isolated from the striatum of rat brain. This effect was not produced by other phospholipids or glycolipids. Phosphatidate, but not other phospholipids, evoked the release of [3H] dopamine from striatal synaptosomes. The magnitude of both effects was similar to that observed after chemical depolarization of the nerve terminals. These results show that phosphatidate is the only membrane lipid component that acts as a functionally competent ionophore and support the suggestion that phosphatidate may serve as a link between depolarization and neurotransmitter release in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2000148742,Simultaneous recordings of calcium action potentials directly from growth cones and from somata of neuroblastoma cells indicated that they could be generated in the neurites at or near growth cones. Growth cone responses were measured with a fluorescent voltage-sensitive dye and a 5-milliwatt helium-neon laser microbeam as a monitoring light source.
https://openalex.org/W2052094887,"The content of tetrahydrobiopterin in rat brain was doubled by peripherally administered tetrahydrobiopterin, with the natural 1 diastereoisomer more effective than the unnatural d configuration. The model pteridine, 6-methyltetrahydropterin was ten times more efficient than tetrahydrobiopterin in crossing the blood-brain barrier, and striatal concentrations of 6-methyltetrahydropterin remained elevated for 2 hours, declining with a half-life of 3 hours. While no evidence for a specific uptake mechanism for concentrating 6-methyltetrahydropterin in cells containing tetrahydrobiopterin was detected, the pterin was found in its presumed site of action, the nerve terminal. Replacement therapy with reduced pterins may therefore be effective in the treatment of the neurological disorders associated with the variant forms of hyperphenylalaninemia that result from defects in the biosynthesis or metabolism of tetrahydrobiopterin within the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2009819465,A new spiroplasma isolated from Ixodes pacificus collected in Oregon was serologically and morphologically distinct from known spiroplasmas. The new spiroplasma could also be isolated in tick cell cultures. Discovery of a new fastidious mycoplasma in ticks offers opportunities to explore the possible role of these agents in human and animal diseases.
https://openalex.org/W1972385519,"Data from the New York Cancer Registry show no evidence for higher cancer rates associated with residence near the Love Canal toxic waste burial site in comparison with the entire state outside of New York City. Rates of liver cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia, which were selected for special attention, were not consistently elevated. Among the other cancers studied, a higher rate was noted only for respiratory cancer, but it was not consistent across age groups and appeared to be related to a high rate for the entire city of Niagara Falls. There was no evidence that the lung cancer rate was associated with the toxic wastes buried at the dump site."
https://openalex.org/W2072690548,"The membranes from normal and Plasmodium knowlesi-infected rhesus monkey erythrocytes (90 to 95 percent infected with early ring stage) were analyzed for transbilayer distribution of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS), by means of chemical and enzymatic probes. The external monolayer of the normal red cell membrane contained at least 68 to 72 percent of the total phosphatidylcholine and 15 to 20 percent of the total phosphatidylethanolamine. In the infected cell, the transmembrane phosphatidylcholine distribution appeared to be reversed, with only 20 to 30 percent of it being externally localized, whereas roughly equal amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine were present in the outer and inner surfaces. However, total phosphatidylserine in both the infected and normal red cells was exclusively internal. Unlike that in the normal intact cell, external phosphatidylethanolamine in the parasitized cell was readily accessible to phospholipase A2. These results indicate that significant changes in molecular architecture of the host cell membrane are the result of parasitization."

Immunochemical methods show no detectable C3 in the serum of the affected dogs, and there is no evidence of an inhibitor of C3 in the serum. The C3 deficiency appears to be transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait."
https://openalex.org/W1974590824,"The mutation component, M, is a measure of the proportion of the impact of a genetic condition that is attributable to recurrent mutation. For a trait maintained by balance between mutation and directional selection, M is approximately the broad-sense heritability; for a measured character where the mean and optimum coincide, M is about half the heritability. If the narrow-sense heritability is high, the impact changes relatively rapidly with a change in mutation rate. If the narrow-sense heritability is low, M cannot be predicted, but the change in impact following a change in mutation rate, if any, is very slow."
https://openalex.org/W1970623301,Concentrations of estradiol and progesterone in blood collected during the 12.5-day gestation period of the Virginia opossum were not significantly different from those during equivalent days of the estrous cycle. Progesterone was correlated with an index of corpora luteral mass. Ratio of estradiol to progesterone were highest 3 to 4 days before estrus and on the day of parturition.
https://openalex.org/W1979294545,"Studies on the efficacy of a vaccine against schistosomiasis in young baboons (Papio anubis) disclosed that immunization with Schistosoma mansoni cercariae attenuated by gamma irradiation induced significant protection against subsequent infection with normal, viable S. mansoni cercariae. Such immunization resulted in reduced worm burdens (70 percent) and egg excretion rates (82 percent). These results support immunization as a potential method for schistosomiasis control."
https://openalex.org/W1963833942,"Intense rapid eye movements (REM) during sleep were investigated as a possible indication of delay in the neurodevelopment of infants. The rate of occurrence of REM storms was determined by monitoring the sleep of 15 normal, first-born infants during weeks 2 through 5 and at 3, 6, 12 months. The amount of REM within each 10-second interval of active sleep was rated on a four-point scale based on frequency and intensity of eye movements. When the babies were 12 months old, the Bayley Scales of Mental Development were administered. A significant negative correlation was found between the frequency of REM storms of 14 subjects was also studied. The negative correlation was confirmed. The findings support the suggestion that by 6 months of age REM storms express dysfunction or delay in the development of central inhibitory feedback controls for sleep organization and phasic sleep-related activities."
https://openalex.org/W2169548414,"Rats poisoned with paraquat benefited from daily niacin therapy. Niacin-treated rats showed delayed and reduced dyspnea. Deaths began approximately 30 hours later. The time required for niacin-treated rats to reach 50 percent mortality increased from 60 to 120 hours, and the dealth rate was reduced form 75 to 55 percent. The benefit by niacin is consistent with the demonstrated role of niacin in preventing cellular decreases of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide during poisoning of bacteria by paraquat and by hyperbaric oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W2055030980,"An inflammatory toxin was extracted from Mycoplasma bovis with 75 percent aqueous ethanol. The toxin is a complex polysaccharide composed of glucose, glucosamine or galactosamine, and a heptose, is heat-stable, devoid of protein and lipid, and has a molecular weight of 73,000. The holotoxin in the cell membrane is a glycoprotein; however, it is the polysaccharide portion that is toxic. This inflammatory toxin increases vascular permeability and is capable of activating complement. Infusion of 0.9 milligram of toxin into the bovine udder resulted in the characteristic eosinophilic mastitis produced by Mycoplasma bovine."
https://openalex.org/W2070742543,"Improved image quality in soft x-ray contact microscopy can be obtained by examining the resist with transmission rather than scanning electron microscopy. Application of the new technique to air-dried preparations of human blood platelets reveals structures not visible in the same cells with transmission electron microscopy or when the resist is examined by scanning electron microscopy. As seen by the new technique, platelet pseudopods contain a central structure connected to a network in the platelet and dense bodies exhibit a lamellar structure."
https://openalex.org/W1964222996,"The insertion of oxygenated sterol compounds into human red blood cell membranes as well as the consequent transformation of the red cells to an echinocyte shape and the expansion of the membranes are impeded by the presence of serum lipoproteins in the incubation medium. All density classes of human serum lipoproteins bind oxygenated sterol compounds, and lipoproteins can act as acceptors of oxygenated sterols previously inserted into red cells. Since oxygenated sterols have been reported to be atherogenic, the modulating and possibly protective effects of serum lipoproteins on oxygenated sterol-induced derangement of cell membrane structure and function may provide a useful model for further study."

After 6 weeks in culture, the growth of the parasite had permitted a 5 X 10(6) cumulative dilution of the original inoculum. Cultured parasites remained infective to rhesus monkeys and exhibited a reversible decrease in the ameboid behavior of their trophozoites."
https://openalex.org/W2008757922,"Of 42 maned wolves in zoos or live-trapped in Brazil, 34 had excessive cystine in their urine. Renal clearance studies of five of the affected wolves revealed a variable defect for the reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids. The renal tubular handling of other solutes including glucose, phosphate, sodium, potassium, and uric acid was considered normal. Urinary calculi composed of cystine were found in four wolves and proved fatal in three of them. With the exception of the high incidence in this species, this hereditary disease resembles the disorder described in dogs and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2002500758,Unmyelinated mouse cerebellar cerebellar cultures in which oligodendrocyte differentiation had been suppressed by exposure to cytosine arabinoside developed axonal myelin after superimposition of kainic acid-treated cerebellar explants devoid of myelin-receptive axons. The latter explants contained differentiated oligodendrocytes. The operation of a diffusible myelin-stimulating factor was ruled out by the failure of myelination in cytosine arabinoside-exposed explants not in direct contact with oligodendrocyte-containing transplants.
https://openalex.org/W2067372537,"Gallamine triethiodide (Flaxedil) is commonly used as a neuromuscular blocking agent. Voltage-clamp studies show that gallamine also directly affects amphibian and mammalian myelinated nerve fibers. Externally, gallamine is about five times more potent than tetraethylammonium in blocking potassium conductance, where this is present, but has no effect on the sodium channel. Internal application slows sodium inactivation, which in addition is often incomplete. At positive potentials, gallamine can occlude sodium channels, thereby almost eliminating outward sodium currents."
https://openalex.org/W1983413750,"Microscopic methods of performing motility assays of spermatozoa are slow, subjective, and involve a small number of spermatozoa. Laser light-scattering methods can analyze the motility of many spermatozoa within minutes. The swimming speed distribution of human spermatozoa was investigated by photon correlation spectroscopy. The sperm was diluted in seminal plasma to avoid modifying the viscosity. The swimming speed distribution was reconstructed from the correlation data by Stock's method of splines. When compared with a videomicroscopic assay, the reconstructed swimming speed distribution accurately reflects translational motion between 0 and 80 micrometers per second, while for speeds greater than 80 micrometers per second the distribution is distorted by the effects of rotational motion."
