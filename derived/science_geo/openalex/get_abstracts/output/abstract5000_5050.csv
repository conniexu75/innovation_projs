https://openalex.org/W1545899030,"Glutathione reductase from rat liver has been purified greater than 5000-fold in a yield of 20%. The molecular weights of the enzyme and its subunits were estimated to be 125,000 and 60,000, respectively, indicating that the native enzyme is a dimer. The enzyme molecular contains 2 FAD molecules, which are reducible by NADPH, GSH or dithioerythritol. The reduced flavin is instantaneously reoxidized by addition of GSSG. The steady state kinetic data are consistent with a branching reaction mechanism previously proposed for glutathione reductase from yeast (MANNERVIK, B. (1973) Biochem. Biophy. Res. Commun. 53, 1151-1158). This mechanism is also favored by the nonlinear inhibition pattern produced by NADP-+. However, at low GSSG concentrations the rate equation can be approximated by that of a simple ping pong mechanism. NADPH and the mixed disulfide of coenzyme A and GSH were about 10% as active as NADPH and GSSG, respectively, whereas some sulfenyl derivatives related to GSSG were less active as substrates. The pH activity profiles of these substrates differed from that of the NADPH-GSSG substrate pair."

https://openalex.org/W1528765423,"(minus)-Alprenolol, a potent, competitive beta-adrenergic antagonist labeled to high specific activity with tritium (17 Ci per mmol), has been used to identify binding sites in frog erythrocyte membranes having many of the characteristics to be expected of the beta-adrenergic receptors which are linked to adenylate cyclase in these membranes. The chromatographic behavior and biological activity of the labeled and native drug were essentially identical. (minus)-Alprenolol and (minus)-[3-H]alprenolol both competitively antagonize isoproterenol stimulation of frog erythrocyte membrane adenylate cyclase with a KD OF 5 TO 10 NM. (minus)-[3-H]Alprenolol binding to sites in the frog erythrocyte membranes was studied by a centrifugal assay. At 37 degrees, equilibrium binding was established within 5 min and the half-time for dissociation of bound (minus)-[3-H]alprenolol was approximately 30 s. This rapid onset and dissociation of (minus)-[3-H]alprenolol binding was in good agreement with the rapid onset of action of beta-adrenergic agonists and antagonists on the frog erythrocyte adenylate cyclase. (minus)-[3-H]Alprenolol binding was saturable. There were 0.25 to 0.35 pmol of (minus)-[3-H]alprenolol binding sites per mg of protein corresponding to 1300 to 1800 binding sites per intact frog erythrocyte. The binding sites showed half-maximal saturation at 5.0 to 10 nM (minus)-[3-H]alprenolol, which is in good agreement with the KD for alprenolol antagonism of isoproterenol stimulation of adenylate cyclase. The (minus)-[3-H]alprenolol binding sites exhibited strict stereospecificity. (minus)-Stereoisomers of beta-adrenergic antagonists or agonists were approximately 2 orders of magnitude more potent than the (+)-stereoisomers in competing for the binding sites. Comparable stereospecificity was apparent when agonists and antagonists were tested for their ability to interact with the adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenergic receptors in the membranes. Potency series of 11 agonists and 13 antagonists for inhibition of binding and interaction with adenylate cyclase were identical and were characteristic of a beta2-adrenergic receptor. A variety of nonphysiologically active compounds containing a catechol moiety as well as several metabolites and cholinergic agents did not inhibit (minus)-[3-H]alprenolol binding or interact significantly as agonists or antagonists with the adenylate cyclase. The (minus)-[3-H]alprenolol binding sites studied appear to be equivalent to the beta-adrenergic receptor binding sites in the frog erythrocyte membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1508261186,"Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase purified to apparent homogeneity from rabbit intestine was inhibited by scavengers for superoxide anion such as superoxide dismutase and 1,2-dihydroxybenzene-3,5-disulfonic acid (Tiron). On the other hand, beta-carotene and 1,4-diazobicyclo-(2,2,2)-octane, scavengers for singlet oxygen, did not affect the enzyme activity significantly. The degree of inhibition of the dioxygenase by superoxide dismutase preparations from bovine erythrocytes, green peas, spinach leaves, and Escherichia coli paralleled that observed with these dismutase preparations on the aerobic reduction of cytochrome c by xanthine oxidase and its substrate. The pH profiles of the inhibition by dismutase of the dioxygenase and cytochrome c reduction were also similar and the maximal inhibition was observed around pH 10 in both cases. The degree of inhibition was not affected by the concentration of substrate but was a function of the concentration of dismutase. It was inversely related to the concentrations of the dioxygenase and its cofactors, ascorbic acid and methylene blue, both of which were required for maximum activity. Ascorbic acid could be replaced either by xanthine oxidase and its substrate, or by tetrabutylammonium superoxide prepared by electrolytic reduction of molecular oxygen, or by potassium superoxide. When limited amounts of superoxide anion were added to the reaction mixture containing a substrate amount of the dioxygenase, the ratio of the amount of superoxide anion added to that of the product formed was approximately unity both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that superoxide anion, rather than molecular oxygen, is utilized as substrate by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W1498131095,"The cyanide-insensitive superoxide dismutase of yeast has been shown to be localized in the mitochondrial matrix. This enzyme has been isolated in good yield from bakers' yeast. Its molecular weight is 96,000. It is a tetramer, being composed of four subunits of equal size. Exposure to sodium dodecyl sulfate at 100 degrees caused dissociation into dimers, while similar treatment but in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol caused complete dissociation into monomers. This enzyme contains 1 atom of manganese per subunit and its absorption in the visible suggests Mn(III) in the resting enzyme. Ascorbate caused partial bleaching, presumably by reduction to Mn(II). The amino acid composition was determined. This enzyme has activity comparable to that of other previously reported superoxide dismutases and like the chicken mitochondrial and the bacterial enzymes, its rate of reaction with O2 falls as the pH is raised above 7.8. Crystals of high quality were easily prepared."
https://openalex.org/W1601451310,"Pneumococci growing on choline-containing medium are known to incorporate this amino alcohol into the wall teichoic acid and produce autolysin-sensitive cell walls. In contrast, bacteria grown on the choline analogue, ethanolamine, incorporate ethanolamine into the teichoic acid and synthesize cell walls that are resistant to the homologous autolysin. In this communication, we report experiments aimed at understanding the biochemical mechanism of this phenomenon. Ethanolamine-containing (autolysin-resistant) cell walls were methylated in vitro with methyl iodide. Under appropriate conditions, virtually all of the ethanolamine residues could be converted to choline. After methylation, the formerly autolysin-resistant walls could be quantitatively hydrolyzed by the pneumococcal autolysin. Methylated walls also recovered another property typical of cell walls isolated from choline-grown bacteria: they could induce the in vitro conversion of an inactive form of autolysin to the catalytically active form (Tomasz, A., and Westphal, M. (1971) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 68, 2627-2630). The results suggest that the autolysin-catalyzed hydrolysis of amide bonds in the peptidoglycan requires an additional interaction between the enzyme protein and choline residues in the teichoric acid portion of the cell wall."

Median effective concentration of the crystalline pheromone is 3.5 X 10-minus 10 mole per liter of seawater."
https://openalex.org/W1515976188,"Kidney alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme which requires two types of metals for maximal activity: zinc, which is essential, and magnesium, which is stimulatory. The main features of the Mg2+ stimulation have been analyzed. The stimulation is pH-dependent and is observed mainly between pH 7.5 and 10.5. Mg2+ binding to native alkaline phosphatase is characterized by a dissociation constant of 50 muM at pH 8.5,25 degrees. Binding of Zn2+ is an athermic process. Both the rate constants of association, ka, and of dissociation, kd, have low values. Typical values are 7 M(-1) at pH 8.0, 25 degrees, for ka and 4.10(-4) S(-1) at pH 8.0, 25 degrees, for kd. The on and off processes have high activation energies of 29 kcal mol (-1). Mg2+ can be replaced at its specific site by Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+. Zinc binding to the Mg2+ site inhibits the native alkaline phosphatase. Mn2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ also bind to the Mg2+ site with a stimulatory effect which is nearly identic-al with that of Mg2+, Mn2+ is the stimulatory cation which binds most tightly to the Mg2+ site; the dissociation constant of the Mn2+ kidney phosphatase complex is 2 muM at pH 8.5. The stoichiometry of Mn2+ binding has been found to be 1 eq of Mn2+ per mol of dimeric kidney phosphatase. The native enzyme displays absolute half-site reactivity for Mn2+ binding. Mg2+ binding site and the substrate binding sites are distinct sites. The Mg2+ stimulation corresponds to an allosteric effect. Mg2+ binding to its specific sites does not affect substrate recognition, it selectively affects Vmax values. Quenching of the phosphoenzyme formed under steady state conditions with [32P]AMP as a substrate as well as stopped flow analysis of the catalyzed hydrolysis of 2,4-dinitrophenyl phosphate or p-nitrophenyl phosphate have shown that the two active sites of the native and of the Mg2+-stimulated enzyme are not equivalent. Stopped flow analysis indicated that one of the two active sites was phosphorylated very rapidly whereas the other one was phosphorylated much more slowly at pH 4.2. Half of the sites were shown to be reactive at pH 8.0. Quenching experiments have shown that only one of the two sites is phosphorylated at any instant; this result was confirmed by the stopped flow observation of a burst of only 1 mol of nitrophenol per mol of dimeric phosphatase in the pre-steady state hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The half-of-the-sites reactivity observed for the native and for the Mg2+-stimulated enzyme indicates that the same type of complex, the monophosphorylated complex, accumulates under steady state conditions with both types of enzymes. Mg2+ binding to the native enzyme at pH 8.0 increases considerably the dephosphorylation rate of this monophosphorylated intermediate. A possible mechanism of Mg2+ stimulation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1509728658,"Adenylate cyclase activity in purified plasma membranes from rat fat cells displays transient kinetic characteristics in the absence and presence of guanyl=5'=yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). Gpp(NH)p causes immediate inhibition of enzyme activity; the inhibitory phase is followed by a slow increase in activity which, depending on incubation temperature, exceeds activity stimulated in the presence of hormones (glucagon, secretin, epinephrine, or adrenocorticotropin). Basal activity displays an initial high rate of activity which decays to a low state of activity within 2 min of incubation. Hormones do not alter the initial rate but prevent the decay in enzyme activity. The inhibitory phase of Gpp(NH)p action and the previously reported (Harwood, J.P., Low, H., and Rodbell, M. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 6239-6245) inhibitory effects of GTP are abolished by increasing (Mg2+) and pH to 50 mM and 8.5, respectively. Under these conditions, Gpp(NH)p and GTP cause marked stimulation of activity, the stimulatory effect of Gpp(NH)p being greater than that of GTP both in the absence and presence of hormones..."

https://openalex.org/W1576724376,"The technique of velocity sedimentation at unit gravity has been used to separate rat testis cell suspensions into fractions enriched in particular cell types. Changes in the nuclear proteins from the various fractions have been characterized by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and correlated with the changing morphology of the nucleus during spermatogenesis. The most striking alterations in both protein composition and nuclear morphology occur during spermatid maturation as both histone and non-histone proteins are replaced by highly basic, low molecular weight, spermatidal proteins. This replacement process is accompanied by a quantitative reduction in both histone and non-histone proteins. The synthesis of at least three basic proteins has been identified with late stage spermatids. One of these proteins is a highly basic sperm-specific protein containing high levels of cyst(e)ine and arginine. A second protein synthesized in late stage spermatids is lysine rich, while the third protein contains cyst(e)ine and co-migrates with histone F2a1 on acid-urea polyacrylamide gels. The changes in protein composition of rat testis nuclei after irradiation or hypophysectomy reflect the resulting changes in the cellular composition of the testis. After selective elimination of the germinal cells by irradiation, the electrophoretic pattern of acid-soluble proteins from the testis is very similar to that of somatic tissue. Thus, the cellular specificity of nuclear proteins demonstrated here using cell separation techniques is also apparent following treatments which selectively alter the cellular composition of the testis."
https://openalex.org/W1558958594,"Abstract Submitochondrial particles subjected to an artificially imposed electrochemical proton gradient consisting of a pH gradient (acid to base transition) and membrane potential (low to high K-+ transition in the presence of valinomycin) catalyzed the net synthesis of 2.5 nmol of [-32P]ATP per mg of protein from ADP and 32-Pi. Optimal reaction conditions included incubation of submitochondrial particles in malonate at pH 5.0 with valinomycin in the absence of added K-+, followed by a rapid transition to pH 7.5 and 100 mM K-+. ATP synthesis continued for about 6 s and was sensitive to uncouplers or oligomycin but insensitive to inhibitors of electron transport. Lower amounts of ATP were formed by either the pH gradient (25%) of K-+ gradient (15%) alone. These results demonstrate that an electrochemical gradient of protons can drive the synthesis of ATP by reversal of the proton-translocating ATPase independent of electron transport."
https://openalex.org/W1616047468,"Rat and calf adrenal cortex homogenates were found to contain three different malic enzymes. Two were strictly NADP+-dependent and were localized, one each, in the cytosol and the mitochondrial fractions, respectively. These two enzymes appear to be identical to those described by Simpson and Estabrook (Simpson, E. R., and Estabrook, R. W. (1969) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 129, 384-395). The third was NAD(P)+-linked and was present in the mitochondrial fraction only. All three malic enzymes separated as distinct bands during electrophoresis on 5 percent polyacrylamide slab gels at pH 9.0. Marker enzymes and the mitochondrial malic enzymes migrated together in intact mitochondria during sucrose density gradient centrifugations despite changes in the equilibrium position of the mitochondria promoted by energy-dependent calcium phosphate accumulation. In adrenal cortex mitochondria subfractionated by the method of Sottocasa et al. (SOTTOCASA, G.L., KUYLENSTIERNA, B., ERNSTER, L., and BERGSTAND, A. (1967) J. Cell Biol. 32, 415-438), both malic enzymes were associated with the inner membrane-matrix space. Sonication solubilized the two malic enzymes along with the matrix space marker enzymes. The NAD(P)+-dependent malic enzyme was purified 100-fold from calf adrenal cortex mitochondria. The final preparation was free of malic dehydrogenase, fumarase, the strictly NADP+-linked malic enzyme and adenylate kinase. Either Mn24 orMg2+ was required for activity and 1 mol of pyruvate was formed for each mole of NAD+ and NADP+ reduced. The pH optima with NAD+ and NADP+ were 6.5 tp 7.0 and 6.0 to 6.5, respectively. Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed on the alkaline side. Fumarate, succinate, and isocitrate were positive and ATP and ADP were negative modulators of the regulatory enzyme. The modulators did not influence the stoichiometry and they were not metabolized during the reaction. Under Vmax conditions the ratios for the rate of NAD+:NADP+ reduction were 1.76 and 1.15 at pH 7.4 and 6.0, respectively. The apparent Michaelis constants also differed depending on the pH and the coenzyme. At pH 7.4 (in the presence of 5 mM fumarate) and at pH 6.0 (no fumarate) the Km values for (-)-malate, NAD+, and Mn2+ were 1.7, 0.16, and 0.15 mM, and 0.31, 0.06, and 0.09 mM, respectively. At pH 7.4 (5MM fumarate) and pH 6.0 (no fumarate), the Km values for (-)-malate, NADP+, and Mn2+ were 6.5, 0.62, and 0.59 mM, and 0.68. 0.12, and 0.31 mM, respectively. The apparent Ki values for ATP with NAD+ and NADP+ as coenzyme were 0.42 and 0.27 mM, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1654548338,"Pyrocatechase (catechol 1,2-oxidoreductase (decyclizing), EC 1.13.11.1), a ferric ion-containing dioxygenase from Pseudomonas arvilla C-1, catalyzes the intradiol cleavage of catechol with insertion of 2 atoms of molecular oxygen to form cis,cis-muconic acid. The enzyme also catalyzed the oxidation of various catechol derivatives, including 4-methylcatechol, 4-chlorocatechol, 4-formylcatechol (protocatechualdehyde), 4,5-dichlorocatechol, 3,5-dichlorocatechol, 3-methylcatechol, 3-methoxycatechol, and 3-hydroxycatechol (pyrogallol). All of these substrates gave products having an absorption maximum at around 260 nm, which is characteristic of cis,cis-muconic acid derivatives. However, when 3-methylcatechol was used as substrate, the product formed showed two absorption maxima at 390 and 260 nm. These two absorption maxima were found to be attributable to two different products, 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-2,4-heptadienoic acid and 5-carboxy-2-methyl-2,4-pentadienoic acid (2-methylmuconic acid). The former was produced by the extradiol cleavage between the carbon atom carrying the hydroxyl group and the carbon atom carrying the hydroxyl group and the carbon atom carrying the methyl group; the latter by an intradiol cleavage between two hydroxyl groups. Since these products were unstable, they were converted to and identified as 6-methylpyridine-2-carboxylic acid and 2-methylmuconic acid dimethylester, respectively. Similarly, 3-methoxycatechol gave two products, namely, 2-hydroxy-5-methoxycarbonyl-2,4-pentadienoic acid and 5-carboxy-2-methoxy-2,4-pentadienoic acid (2-methoxymuconic acid). With 3-methylcatechol as substrate, the ratio of intradiol and extradiol cleavage activities of Pseudomonas pyrocatechase during purification was almost constant and was about 17. The final preparation of the enzyme was homogeneous when examined by disc gel electrophoresis and catalyzed both reactions simultaneously with the same ratio as during purification. All attempts to resolve the enzyme into two components with separate activities, including inactivation of the enzyme with urea or heat, treatment with sulfhydryl-blocking reagents or chelating agents, and inhibition of the enzyme with various inhibitors, proved unsuccessful. These results strongly suggest that Pseudomonas pyrocatechase is a single enzyme, which catalyzes simultaneously both intradiol and extradiol cleavages of some 3-substituted catechols."
https://openalex.org/W1481732466,"The possible role of histidine residues in the catalytic function of Y from bakers' yeast has been investigated using site-specific reagents. Among the reagents tested, benzyloxy-L-phenylalanylchloromethane (Z-PheCH2Cl) was the most powerful inhibitor of the enzyme. It irreversibly inactivated both the peptidase and esterase activities with an apparent second order rate constant of 3.8 M-minus 1 S-minus 1; the D isomer caused essentially no effect on either activity. Inhibition by L-Z-PheCH2Cl, the reaction retarded by certain competitive inhibitors of the enzyme. Using radioactive L-Z-PheCH2Cl, the reaction with the enzyme was shown to be essentially stoichiometric. Diisopropylphosphorofluoridate (iPr2PF)-inactivated enzyme failed to react with Z-PheCH2Cl, and conversely, the Z-PheCH2Cl-inhibited enzyme failed to react with radioactive iPr2PF. Amino acid analyses of the Z-PheCH2Cl-inactivated enzyme revealed the loss of essentially 1 residue, with a concomitant yield of a 0.62 residue of N-t-carboxymethylhistidine. Since Y has a reactive at its active center, we concluded from these results that the mechanism involves a charge-relay system in the hydrolysis of peptide and ester substrates, as in chymotrypsin. An -SH group of Y was not affected during the reaction with L-Z-PheCH2Cl. The generic name serine carboxypeptidase has been proposed for Y and for the iPr2PF-sensitive carboxypeptidases from plants, molds, and animal tissues, in order to distinguish them from metal carboxypeptidase to which A (EC 3.4.12.2) and B (EC 3.4.12.3) belong."
https://openalex.org/W1585817752,"Homogeneous liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase, which catalyzes the condensation of acetyl-CoA with acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA, also carries out: (a) a rapid transacetylation from acetyl-CoA to 31-dephospho-CoA and (b) a slow hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA to acetate and CoA. Transacetylation and hydrolysis occur at 50 and 1 percent, respectively, the rate of the synthasecatalyzed condensation reaction. It appears that an acetyl-enzyme intermediate is involved in the transacetylase and hydrolase reactions of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, as well as in the over-all condensation process. Covalent binding to the enzyme of a [14C]acetyl group contributed by [1(-14)C]acetyl-CoA is indicated by migration of the [14C]acetyl group with the dissociated synthase upon electrophoresis in dodecyl sulfate-urea and by precipitation of [14C]acetyl-enzyme with trichloroacetic acid. At 0 degrees and a saturating level of acetyl-CoA, the synthase is rapidly (less than 20 s) acetylated yielding 0.6 acetyl group/enzyme dimer. Performic acid oxidation completely deacetylates the enzyme, suggesting the site of acetylation to be a cysteinyl sulfhydryl group. Proteolytic digestion of [14C]acetyl-S-enzyme under conditions favorable for intramolecular S to N acetyl group transfer quantitatively liberates a labeled derivative with a [14C]acetyl group stable to performic acid oxidation. The labeled oxidation product is identified as N-[14C]acetylcysteic acid, thus demonstrating a cysteinyl sulfhydryl group as the original site of acetylation. The ability of the acetylated enzyme, upon addition of acetoacetyl-CoA, to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA indicates that the acetylated cysteine residue is at the catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W1494512681,"A lysophospholipase from Escherichia coli cells was purified about 1,500-fold to near homogeneity by extraction with Tris-HCl buffer, streptomycin treatment, (NH4)2SO4 fractionation, column chromatographies on Sephadex G-200, DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite-cellulose, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The final preparation had a molecular weight of 39,500 plus or minus 500. The enzyme hydrolyzes 1-acylglycerylphosphorylethanolamine, 2-acylglycerylphosphorylethanoiamine, and 1-acylglycerylphosphorylglycerol, but does not attack diacylphospholipids with long chain fatty acids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol. The enzyme does not show any esterase activity against p-nitrophenyl acetate or palmitate. Although it does not hydrolyze triacylglycerol or diacylglycerol, it hydrolyzes 1-acylglycerol at almost the same rate as 1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphorylethanolamine. Results indicated that the acyl-hydrolyzing activities toward monoacyl-glycerylphosphorylethanolamine and monoacylglycerol belong to the same enzyme. In general, acidic and nonionic detergents inhibited the reaction. This lysophospholipase preparation hydrolyzes the monomolecular and micellar forms of lysophospholipids as well as of monoacylglycerol. The monomolecular and micellar forms of Triton X-100 both inhibited the hydrolyses of lysophospholipids and monoacylglycerol."

https://openalex.org/W1506284450,"Salmonella typhimurium strain LT-2 was found to utilize phosphoenolpyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate, and 3-phosphoglycerate as sole sources of carbon and energy for growth, but Escherichia coli strains did not. The following evidence suggests that this growth difference was due to the presence in Salmonella cells of an inducible phosphoglycerate permease distinct from previously studied transport systems: (a) The ability of cells to take up 3-phospho[14-C]glycerate was induced by growth in the presence of phosphoenolpyruvate, 2-phosphoglycerate, or 3-phosphoglycerate, but not glycerate, alpha-glycerophosphate, or other carbon sources tested. (b) Uptake of 3-phospho[14-C]glycerate was strongly inhibited by the three nonradioactive inducers of 3-phosphoglycerate uptake, but not by glycerate or alpha-glycerophosphate. (c) Mutants which lost the ability to utilize and take up 3-phosphoglycerate simultaneously lost the ability to utilize 2-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, but not other compounds tested. (d) Mutant strains which constitutively synthesized the phosphoglycerate transport system could use both phosphoglycerates and phosphoenolpyruvate as sole sources of phosphate at low substrate concentrations. (e) A strain lacking alkaline and acid phosphatases could still grow with 3-phosphoglycerate as sole carbon source. Maximal rates of 3-phospho[14-C]glycerate uptake occurred at pH 6 in the presence of an exogenous energy source. The apparent Km for 3-phosphoglycerate uptake under these conditions was about 10-minus 4 M. The maximal uptake rate (but not the Km) was dependent on potassium ions. Although synthesis of the phosphoglycerate transport system appeared to be under adenosine 3:5-monophosphate control, glucose repressed induction only slightly. The genes controlling synthesis of the phosphoglycerate transport system (pgt genes) appeared to map at about 74 min on the Salmonella chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1519028244,"Fatty acid synthetase complex (Mr = 500,000) purified from pigeon liver homogenates is inactivated by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A well characterized inhibitor of serine esterases. Pseudounimolecular kinetics are followed at all inhibitor concentrations studied (0.05 to 1.0 mM). The second order rate constant obtained at pH 7.0, 30 degrees in 0.05 M potassium phosphate, 1 mM EDTA is 250 plus or minus 10 M-1 min-1 and appears to be independent of pH between 6 and 7.9. The inactivation of the enzyme complex appears to be selective since only one of the several component enzymes of fatty acid synthesis, palmityl-CoA deacylase, is inhibited. Acetyl- and malonyl-CoA-pantetheine transacylase activities as well as the kinetics of the reduction and dehydration steps are nearly identical for the native and the modified enzymes. The rate of approach of the condensation-CO2 exchange reaction (substrates: hexanoyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, CoA, and H14CO3-) is slightly slower in the modified enzyme, though this change is not large enough to account for total loss of activity for fatty acid synthesis. The rate of loss of palmityl-CoA deacylase activity at a constant inhibitor concentration follows biphasic kinetics. Complete inactivation is achieved only after 2 mol of the inhibitor are bound per mol of the enzyme complex. Acetyl-, butyryl-, and hexanoyl-CoA thioesters (at 1.0 mM concentrations) protect the enzyme complex against inactivation by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride whereas CoA has no effect. Malonyl-CoA on the other hand, promotes inhibitor-mediated inactivation. Of the N-acetyl cysteamine derivatives tested, S-acetyl-N-acetyl cysteamine (at 10 mM) gives almost complete protection against inactivation whereas S-acetoacetyl-, S-beta-hydroxybutyryl-, and S-crotonyl-N-acetyl cysteamine thioesters exhibit either slight or no protection. These data demonstrate that phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride is a selective reagent for the inactivation of functional fatty acyl deacylase component(s) of the pigeon liver fatty acid synthetase complex, and that it has no effect on malonyl or acetyl transacylases. The data are also in accord with the postulation that the inhibitor interacts at two catalytic centers of the enzyme complex. Furthermore, the patterns of protective effects shown by saturated acyl-CoA asters and malonyl-CoA point to different mechanisms of deacylation for these esters."
https://openalex.org/W1579723803,"We have examined the mechanism by which extracellular free fatty acids regulate fatty acid biosynthesis in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. De novo biosynthesis in intact cells was inhibited by stearate greater than oleate greater than palmitate greater than linoleate. The amount of citrate and long chain acyl-CoA in the cells was not changed appreciably by the addition of free fatty acids to the incubation medium, indicating than free fatty acids do not regulate fatty acid biosynthesis by changing the total intracellular content of these metabolites. By measuring the incorporation of labeled free fatty acids into acyl-CoA, however, it was determined that the fatty acid composition of the acyl-CoA poolwas changed dramatically to reflect the composition of the exogenous free fatty acids. The relative inhibitory effects of different free fatty acids appear to depend on the ability of their acyl-CoA derivatives to regulate acyl-CoA carboxylase activity. The acyl-CoA concentration needed to produce 50% inhibition of purified Ehrlich cell carboxylase was found to be 0.68 mum for stearoyl-CoA, 1.6 mum for oleoyl-CoA, 2.2 mum for palmitoyl-CoA, 23 mum for myristoyl-CoA, 30 mum for lauroyl-CoA, and 37 mum for linoleoyl-CoA. In contrast to their effects on de novo synthesis, all of the free fatty acids added except stearate stimulated chain elongation in intact cells. Microsomal chain elongation, the major system for elongation in Ehrlich cells, also was regulated by the composition of the cellular acyl-CoA pool. Lauroyl-CoA, myristoyl-CoA, and palmitoyl-CoA were good substrates for elongation by isolated microsomes; oleoyl-CoA, and linoleoyl-CoA were intermediate; and stearoyl-CoA was a very poor substrate. We conclude that free fatty acids regulate fatty acid biosynthesis by changing the composition of the cellular acyl-CoA pool. These changes control the rate of malonyl-CoA production and, because of the acyl-CoA substrate specificity of the microsomal elongation system, modulate the amount of malonyl-CoA used for chain elongation."

(1973) Nature New Biol. 241, 207-209) indicate that component I arises in the kidney and components III and IV in the liver. The synchrony of appearance and functional similarity o components I and II suggest that component II probably also arises in the kidney. Thus the development of the tadpole is associated with the successive proliferation of three distinct populations of red cells, first from the kidney, then from the liver, and finally, after metamorphosis, from bone marrow..."

https://openalex.org/W1495877085,"The aggregation of deoxyhemoglobin dimers was studied by dropping the pH of a dilute solution of deoxyhemoglobin originally at high pH. In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate, a sharp increase in the rate of dimer association was observed. At higher concentrations of the phosphate, the rate decreased to a value close to that seen in the absence of phosphate. These observations require that inositol hexaphosphate binds to deoxyhemoglobin dimers. The dependence of the aggregation rate on phosphate concentration occurs because the reaction of a dimer containing bound phosphate with a phosphate-free dimer is 30 to 50 times faster than either the association of phosphate-free dimers or the association of dimers both containing bound phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1524967331,"A unique highly soluble aspermatogenic protein (AP1) was isolated from guinea pig testes and was shown by immunofluorescence to occupy the outer surface of the sperm acrosome. This protein is a potent inducer of allergic orchitis and aspermatogenesis; as little as 0.2 mug induced orchitis in 60 percent of guinea pig tested. The AP1 protein, relatively small and neutral, is stable under acid conditions, but at pH 8.6 shows a variety of forms due either to aggregation or polymorphism. The purified AP1 protein appeared homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 2.7 and in sodium dodecyl sulfate and by immunoelectrophoresis using rabbit antisera to either the purified protein or the testes extract. It also showed a single band on immunodiffusion over a wide concentration range. The purification procedure consisted of delipidation with chloroform/methanol (2/1); acid extraction at pH 3.0; precipitation with 85 percent saturated ammonium sulfate; trichloroacetic acid extraction and gel filtration on Bio-Gel A-1.5; gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-10; chromatography on CM52 cellulose; and preparative gel electrophoresis at pH 2.7. Approximately 20 mg of purified AP1 protein were obtained from 5000 g of wet guinea pig testes. The AP1 protein induced an autoimmune disease characterized by infiltration of mononuclear cells around and within the seminiferous tubules (orchitis), followed by extensive damage and destruction of the germinal cells (aspermatogenesis). The course of the disease induced by this protein (0.5 to 1 mug) was essentially identical with that seen with whole testicular tissue or other purified fractions."

A previously undetected intermediate, gamma-guanidinobutyraldehyde, is identified as the product of alpha-ketoarginine decarboxylase. An 86-fold purification of this enzyme is described. Activity is thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent and cofactor reassociation is facilitated by divalent cations. The order of effectiveness is Mn-2+ greater than Mg-2+, Co-2+ greater than Ca-2+ greater than Ni-2+ greater than Zn-2+. An inducible enzyme that catalyzes conversion of gamma-guanidinobutyraldehyde to gamma-guanidinobutyrate has been studied in cell-free extracts. NAD-+, but no other cofactors, is required. By differential nutritional growth experiments, 4 regulatory units for the L-arginine pathway are proposed and inducers of 2 units are identified."
https://openalex.org/W1586550223,"Abstract Human placental estradiol-17beta dehydrogenase is rapidly inactivated upon treatment with 3-bromoacetoxyestrone. Pseudo-first order kinetic data are obtained and inactivation is accompanied by incorporation of 1 mol of 3-acetoxyestrone/mol of subunit (Mr =34,000). Treatment of the inactivated enzyme with (4S)-[4-2H]DPNH results in the formation of covalently bound [17alpha-2H]estradiol-17beta, which can be released by hydrolysis and identified by gas chromatography-mass sepctrometry. When (4R)-[4-2H]DPNH was used, deuterium was not transferred. Thus, the normal stereochemistry of hydridetransfer is preserved for both partners. After treatment with p-mercuribenzoate, affinity-labeled estradiol-17beta dehyrogenase is no longer able to caralyze reduction its covalently bound estrone; in the presence of DPNH and native enzyme, however, reduction occurs, demonstrating that affinity-labeled enzyme can itself serve as subtrate for native estradiol-17beta dehydrogenase. The reversible enzymatic interconversion of covalently bound estrone was demonstrated using a transhydrogenase assay. The ability of an enzyme to catalyze its normal reaction with a covalently bound substrate is termed catalytic competence, and is considered to be a new criterion for affinity labeling."
https://openalex.org/W1549422575,"Stoichiometry, kinetics, and optical properties of rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase activated with Co(II), Ni(II), Mg(II), and Mn(II) were studied. The stoichiometry of metal binding to enzyme was found to be 4 metal ions per tetrameric enzyme for Co(II) and Ni(II) by carrying out circular dichroic titrations. Cu(II) and Fe(II) were inactive. Ca(II) and Zn(II) were not activating, and were inhibitory with respect to all of the active cations. The temperature dependence of the optimal velocity is similar for all activating metals. The pH rate profiles suggest that there are two classes of enzyme activation by metal ions. Mg(II) and Mn(II) are quite similar to each other while Co(II) and Ni(II) are different from them but similar to each other. Absorption, natural, and magnetic CD in the visible region were used to probe the environment of the activating divalent cation in Ni(II)- and Co(II)-activated pyruvate kinase and their complexes with substrates and inhibitors..."
https://openalex.org/W1520725245,"The formation of hydrogen peroxide during the oxidation of NADH by purified preparations of cytochrome o has been demonstrated by employing three independent methods: polarographic, colorimetric, and fluorometric. The first two methods were used to assay for the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and showed that hydrogen peroxide did accumulate as a product, but only about 30% of the oxygen consumed or 15 to 20% of the NADH oxidized was recoverable as hydrogen peroxide. This lack of 1:1 stoichiometry was not due to residual catalase activity in these preparations which could be eliminated by freeze-thawing. Thus, hydrogen peroxide may not be the sole or primary product of the NADH-cytochrome o oxidase reaction. The fluorometric assay could be coupled directly to the NADH-cytochrome o oxidase reaction in one medium, and this method showed that hydrogen peroxide was generated continuously from the beginning of the reaction in a 1:1 stoichiometry, hydrogen peroxide generated to NADH oxidized. This result suggests that hydrogen peroxide is an intermediate that can be trapped efficiently under the conditions of the fluorometric assay, whereas under the conditions of the first two assays most of the hydrogen peroxide generated undergoes further reaction. Exogenously added FAD or FMN increased the percentage of hydrogen peroxide that accumulated in the NADHcytochrome o oxidase reaction. Flavin is believed to act on the reductase side of cytochrome o so the increased percentage of hydrogen peroxide is not likely to result from the direct reaction of reduced flavin with oxygen."

The CO2-dissociation curves for deoxyhemogloblin can only be fitted by assuming two classes of binding sites for carbon dioxide. The simplest way to account for the experimental data is to assume that the alpha-amino groups of the alpha and beta chains react with carbon dioxide with affinities that differ by at least a factor of 3. No difference in reactivity with CO2 was found among the four terminal alpha-amino groups of carbonmonoxyhemoglobin."

https://openalex.org/W1542777250,"Abstract Citrate lyase from Streptococcus diacetilactis has been purified to yield a protein that was homogeneous as judged by sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium experiments. The enzyme's sedimentation coefficient is 16.8 S and its molecular weight is around 585,000. It contains three nonidentical subunits of about 53,000, 34,000, and 10,000 daltons. The enzyme in its active form contains an acetyl group which turns over during the citrate cleavage reaction. Removal of the acetyl group inactivates the enzyme. The deacetyl enzyme can be partially reactivated by acetylation with acetic anhydride. The enzyme undergoes slow reaction-inactivation. The rate of inactivation is first order and the rate constant of inactivation is much lower than that for a similar inactivation process of the citrate lyase from Klebsiella aerogenes. Like the latter enzyme it contains stoichiometric amounts of phosphopantothenate. The enzyme is inactivated at pH greater than 8.1 and the presence of citrate provides protection against this inactivation. Sedimentation studies of the enzyme at pH 8.7 indicate that the enzyme is dissociated, which may account for the inactivation. The enzyme is immunologically different from citrate lyases of K. aerogenes and Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1629209340,"Stopped flow studies of D2O kinetic solvent isotope effects on the reaction catalyzed by L-glutamate dehydrogenase reveal, in addition to several effects apparently attributable simply to pKa shifts, a 2-fold pH-independent effect on the velocity of the steady state oxidative deamination of L-glutamate by enzyme and NADP. Comparable pH-independent D2O kinetic solvent isotope effects are seen both in a transient phase of the reaction in which alpha-ketoglutarate is displaced by L-glutamate from an enzyme-NADPH-alpha-ketoglutarate (product) complex and in an analogous model reaction in which alpha-ketoglutarate is displaced by D-glutamate. These results suggest that alpha-ketoglutarate dissociation from an enzyme-NADPH-alpha-ketoglutarate complex is rate-limiting in the steady state."

https://openalex.org/W1565707120,"Abstract Mitochondrial ATPase complex has been spin-labeled in the membrane using the inhibitor N-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpeperidyl-1-OXYL)-N(cyclohexyl)carbodiimide (nccd). the amount of NCCD bound to mitochondrial fragments is 0.5 nmol/mg and cannot be dialyzed or extracted with ether, chloroform, or methanol. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of NCCD bound to fragments is pH-sensitive, a greater label immobilization occurring at pH values lower or higher than 7. Ether extraction removes the ATPase inhibition by NCCD without detaching the label. This effect appears to be the consequence of the dislocation of some components of the ATPase complex. Removal of F1 natural inhibitor or of F1 does not affect the spectrum of NCCD bound to fragments, while the removal of oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein produces an increase in the extreme splitting. Oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein may thus interact with the NCCD binding component of the membrane. The isolation of the NCCD-binding proteolipid results in a large increase in the mobility of the label, but addition of dipalmitoyllecithin decreases the mobility of the label to the original level. Phospholipids are thus necessary to keep the NCCD-binding proteolipid in the native conformation."

A 180-fold purification was achieved with an over-all yield of about 12% and an average specific activity of 14. The enzyme was homogeneous as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, and sedimentation equilibrium, studies. Its weight average molecular weight, as measured by sedimentation equilibrium, was 108,000 +/- 3,600. Other methods employed for molecular weight determinations gave values that ranged between 106,000 and 115,000. An analysis of the enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed it to be a dimer composed of subunits having equal molecular weight. The amino acid composition of the streptococcal enzyme is reported. The apparent Km values for NADP and 6-phosphogluconate were calculated from kinetic data and found to be 0.015 mM and 0.024 mM, respectively. Kinetic studies also indicated that the binding of one substrate did not affect the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the other substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1555073632,"The ATP-induced enhancement of the intrinsic fluorescence of myosin and heavy meromyosin (HMM) that persists during the steady state of hydrolysis has been investigated. To compare the substrate-induced changes in fluorescence with those in the electron spin resonance spectrum of the spin-labeled enzyme, we studied the influence of temperature, pH, and ionic strength, as well as the effect of chemical modification (spin labeling) of the SH-1 sulfhydryl groups. Changing the pH between 6 and 9 does not affect the enhancement of fluorescence of myosin or HMM; changing the ionic strength, which could be studied only with HMM, also has no effect; and decreasing the temperature from 20 to 5 degrees slightly diminishes the enhancement with both myosin and HMM. Chemical modification with N-(1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidinyl) iodoacetamide, which blocks the SH-1 thiol groups, reduces the enhancement of fluorescence, induces a strong dependence on ionic strength and pH, and substantially increases the dependence on temperature. The enhancement with labeled myosin or labeled HMM increases with increasing pH, ionic strength, and temperature, closely paralleling the effects of these parameters on the electron spin resonance spectrum of spin-labeled myosin (SEIDEL, J.C. and GERGELY, J. (1973) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 158, 853), suggesting that the same molecular change, induced by ATP and associated with formation of the MADP-P1 complex, underlies both the change in fluorescence and the change in ESR spectrum. Those analogues of ATP that produce the maximal enhancement of fluorescence (WERBER, M., SZENT-GYORGYL, A.G., and FASMAN, G. (1972) Biochemistry 11, 2872) also produce the maximal change in the ESR spectra. Both an amino group at position 6 of the substrate and an unmodified triphosphate chain are required for maximal change in either fluorescence or ESR spectra. The smaller enhancement of fluorescence produced by spin labeling the SH-1 groups persists after the nitroxide has been chemically changed to a diamagnetic species. Thus the small enhancement cannot be attributed to paramagnetic quenching of tryptophan fluorescence by the spin label. An initial burst of phosphate liberation accompanies the hydrolysis of ATP, cytidine 5'-triphosphate, uridine 5'-triphosphate, guanosine 5'-tryphosphate, iosine 5'-triphosphate, 2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-tryphosphate, adenosine 5'-tetraphosphate, and tripolyphosphate. The presence or absence of the burst does not correlate with the extent of the spectral change."

N-Ethylmaleimide also modified the enzyme by reacting with 1 sulfhydryl residue. The reaction rate with N-ethylmaleimide was increased by decreasing the pH from neutrality or by the addition of urea. NADH protected against the modification of the sulfhydryl group under all the conditions tested, again suggesting active site specificity for this inactivation.

Corresponding measuremenportion of tRNA-Gly2-GGA/G molecules isolated from E. coli cells. The missense suppressor mutation, glyTsuA36(HA), results in a C yields U base substitution at the 3' end of the anticodon of tRNA-Gly2-GGA/G(nucleotide position 38). Asecondary effect of this base substitution is the modification of the A residue directly adjacent to the 3' end of the anticodon of tRNA-Gly2-suA36(HA), suggesting that the enzymes responsible for this modification recognize the anticodon sequencesof prospective tRNA substrates. The creation of a missense-suppressing tRNA, tRNA-Gly2-suA36(HA), by an alteration of the anticodon sequence of tRNA-Gly2-GGA/G is analogous to mechanisms whereby other suppressor tRNAs have arisen. The high degree of nucleotide sequence homology between the amino acid acceptor stems and anticodon regions may be recognized by the glycyl-tRNA synthetase; the involvement of theanticodon region in the synthetase recognition process is supported by the greatly decreased rate of aminoacylation of tRNA-Gly2-suA36(HA)."
https://openalex.org/W1596549369,"A hydroxypyruvate reductase has been induced in Pseudomonas acidovorans by growth on glyoxylate. The enzyme has been purified to homogeneity as assessed by the criteria of analytical ultracentrifugation and analytical disc gel electrophoresis. It has a molecular weight of approximately 85,000 and is composed of two identical subunits. The subunits are not interconnected by disulfide bonds although the enzyme has 4 mol of half-cystine per mol of enzyme. The enzyme catalyzes the reversible conversion of hydroxypyruvate to D(minus)-glycerate in the presence of NADH. Glyoxylate cannot replace hydroxypyruvate as a substrate and is a competitive inhibitor of hydroxypyruvate reduction. The activity of the enzyme toward hydroxypyruvate is anion-modulated; the activity of the enzyme toward D(minus)-glycerate is unaffected by anions but is increased by tris-(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane. The subunits of the induced hydroxypyruvate reductase can be renatured. After the enzyme is dissociated in solutions of 6.0 M guanidine hydrochloride containing 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol, optimum renaturation occurs when subunits are diluted into a renaturation solvent consisting of 0.04 M Trischloride, pH 7.4, containing 25% glycerol, 25 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.14 MM NADH. NAD is an inhibitor of renaturation and therefore cannot substitute for NADH. The optimal temperature of dilution and subsequent incubation is 15 degrees, and increases in protein concentration up to 1.2 mg/ml, the highest concentration tested, improve both the rate of renaturation and the yield of active material. The half-time of renaturation at a protein concentration of 1.2 mg/ml was 1 min. The kinetics of renaturation is second order, i.e., is compatible with a bimolecular reaction preducted by the association of two similar subunits. The physical and kinetic parameters of the renatured protein are the same as those of the native enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1740094535,Abstract Adenosine triphosphate phosphoribosyltransferase is inactivated rapidly by bulky alkylating reagents in a biphasic reaction. The initial inactivation rate is dependent upon an optimal concentration of histidine and is more rapid at low enzyme concentrations and low ionic strength. A histidine-free dimer form of the enzyme is the proposed reactive species. The dimer is shown by ultraviolet difference spectroscopy to bind histidine about 1 order of magnitude more weakly than the hexameric form of the enzyme. Alkylated enzyme is similar to native enzyme in dissociation and histidine-binding properties. Native enzyme must exist at significant levels in at least five different conformational and dissociative states to account for the inactivation behavior.

https://openalex.org/W2126352910,"DL-alpha-Methyltryptophan (alphaMeTrp), a synthetic analogue of tryptophan, has been found to be a potent inducer of hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase activity in the adrenalectomized rat. alphaMeTrp is inactive in vitro. Unlike the action of other known inducers (tryptophan, hydrocortisone, adenosine cyclic 3:5-monophosphate, and glucagon), maximal stimulation of enzyme activity occurs only 16 to 30 hours after alphaMeTrp administration and the activity is still elevated at 96 hours. Only the L isomer of alphaMeTrp is active, and addition of a hydroxyl group to position 5 of the indole ring renders an inactive compound. The induction can be prevented by actinomycin D or cycloheximide but not galactosamine. Administration of alphaMeTrp together with hydrocortisone produced an additive stimulation of enzyme activity. alphaMeTrp given along with glucagon or adenosine cyclic 3:5-monophosphate caused a further but not additive increase in enzyme activity. Tryptophan given along with alphaMeTrp promoted no extra stimulation whatsoever. These data indicate that alphaMeTrp and tryptophan may act via a common pathway which in part requires RNA synthesis. Other enzymes, namely alanine and aspartate aminotransferase, ornithine aminotransferase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase, serine dehydratase, and histidine ammonialyase, were not affected by treatment of rats with alphaMeTrp."
