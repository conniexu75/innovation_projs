https://openalex.org/W2472358724,"The incorporation of administered bases into phosphatides and the conversion of serine to ethanolamine and choline in mammalian tissues have been known since the studies of Stetten with the use of ‘SN-labeled compounds (2, 3). The detailed enzymatic steps for these reactions, demonstrated largely by Kennedy and associates, have been recently reviewed (4). These workers showed that phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine are synthesized from phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine by way of the cytidine diphosphate derivatives. Serine is incorporated into phosphatides by the exchange of free serine with the ethanolamine of phosphatidylethanolamine. The decarboxylation of serine to ethanolamine has been demonstrated to occur only via the phosphatidyl derivatives. Likewise, the methylation of ethanolamine apparently takes place only in the lipid form (5, 6). The rates of turnover of phosphatides have been studied with the use of 3*P-labeled phosphate (7-10) and, more recently, with 1Glabeled serine (II). Conclusions from these studies have been limited by a lack of knowledge of the individual enzymatic steps in phosphatide synthesis. In this study the rates of these individual steps have been evaluated in small intestine and liver of the intact rat. Serine3-r% has been administered to rats, and the specific activities of the precursor and product of each reaction have been determined as a function of time. By the use of appropriate models, individual rates have been calculated for each of the reactions known to be involved in phosphatide synthesis. The results give rates considerably faster than those indicated by earlier studies of phosphatide turnover. The present studies show also that rates of synthesis via the cytidine diphosphate pathway are an order of magnitude greater than t,he rates of other reactions involved in phosphatide synthesis. A scheme of the reactions studied is shown in Fig. 1."

https://openalex.org/W1529431026,"SUMMARY Gluconobacter oxydans (suboxydans) contains at least six different polyol dehydrogenases, each with unique structural specificity. These have been defined as a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-specific xylitol dehydrogenase, an NAD- linked D-erythro dehydrogenase, an NAD-linked D-xylo dehydro- genase, an NADP-linked D-&X0 dehydrogenase, and two different NADP-linked gluconate dehydrogenases. One or more L-erythro dehydrogenases (with the Bertrand- Hudson specificity) are attached to the cytoplasmic membrane. The oxidations by growing acetic acid bacteria are mainly due to polyol dehydrogenases localized on the cytoplasmic membrane. The formulation of the rule of Bertrand and Hudson is the result of the unique oxidative properties of the dehydrogenases att,ached to the cytoplasmic membrane of the acetic acid bacteria.

https://openalex.org/W2121030479,"The isolation of one-step mutants, simultaneously requiring arginine and uracil for growth1 (Z-6), has indicated the existence of a specific intermediate shared by the arginine- and the pyrimidine-biosynthetic pathways. Biochemical studies have shown that these two pathways do indeed share a common intermediate, carbamyl phosphate (7-9), the synthesis of which from carbon dioxide, ammonia, and adenosine triphosphate seems to depend on only one enzymatic reaction, the phosphorylation of carbamate (10) ; carbamate itself probably is synthesized nonenzymatically (10). It was thus suggested that the lack of the ability to phosphorylate carbamate may explain the double requirement of the one-step mutants2 (5, 6, 12). However, extracts from many of these mutants, isolated from different strains of Escherichia coli in several laboratories, were found to possess a carbamate-phosphorylating activity comparable in amount to that found in the wild-type extracts2 (4-6, 12). This finding is inconsistent with the interpretation that in E. coli the enzymatic synthesis of carbamyl phosphate is the only step in common for the arginine- and the uridine-synthetic pathways. It is possible that in the biosynthesis of carbamate there is another specific common step, but all attempts to demonstrate a difference in the amount of carbamate formed, enzymatically or nonenzymatically, in the presence of extracts of the wild type or of these mutants, have thus far been unsuccessful. An analogous difficulty arises in the interpretation of results obtained with another class of E. coli mutants having the following behavior: in the absence of uracil their growth is independent of, or only stimulated by, arginine; however, in the presence of uracil these cells manifest a strict requirement for arginine or citrulline (13, 14). This observation would be explained if uracil were repressing the synthesis of carbamyl phosphokinase (ATP : carbamate phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.2.2). However, the finding that the extracts of these cells possess a carbamatephosphorylating activity comparable in amount to that found in the wild type, and in the double-requiring mutants described above, is inconsistent with this interpretation (14)."

https://openalex.org/W154389793,"Insulin has been shown to enhance the incorporation of labeled amino acids into the protein of the isolated rat diaphragm and other tissues (1, 2). The insulin stimulation is not exerted through an effect of the hormone on the transport of external amino acids to intracellular sites of protein synthesis.’ The dependency of this insulin action upon the nutritional status of the animal and a requirement for glucose under certain circumstances have been reported by Krahl and Wool (3-6). These results could not be confirmed by Manchester and Young (7, 8). The attenuation of amino acid incorporation produced by deprivation of food could be relieved not only by glucose and mannose, but also by several monosaccharides which are poorly metabolized (9, 10). A possible relation between glucose metabolism and amino acid incorporation was also suggested by the fact that 2-deoxyn-glucose, a glucose analogue and inhibitor of glycolysis, inhibited amino acid incorporation into rat diaphragm protein (9, 11). The present report concerns the effect of various sugars and other substances on the inhibition of incorporation of L( +)leucine-14C into protein caused by 2-deoxy-n-glucose."
