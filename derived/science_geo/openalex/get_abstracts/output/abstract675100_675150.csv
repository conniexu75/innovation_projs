https://openalex.org/W3165555416,"Potassium helps CO 2 compete in acid Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is a promising means of converting this greenhouse gas into valuable fuels and chemicals. However, two competing reactions restrict the efficiency of this process. In base, much of the CO 2 is trapped as carbonate before reduction; in acid, protons outpace CO 2 at catching electrons from the cathode. Huang et al. report that a high dose of potassium ions can help to solve the latter problem. By concentrating potassium ions at the electrode, high selectivity toward CO 2 reduction at high current in acid is possible, which the authors attribute to electrostatic stabilization of the desired adsorbates.

Strength can be increased by adding extra cross-linking or interpenetrating networks with some sacrificial bonds to enhance toughness; however, these properties deteriorate upon stretching and may be slow to recover after relaxation. Liu et al. developed polyethylene glycol hydrogels cross-linked with moderate fractions of polymers that form sliding rings. These allow the chain to orient in parallel when stretched, leading to rapid and reversible strain-induced crystallization and thus much tougher hydrogels. Science , aaz6694, this issue p. 1078"
https://openalex.org/W3164896384,"The meninges are a membranous structure enveloping the central nervous system (CNS) that host a rich repertoire of immune cells mediating CNS immune surveillance. Here, we report that the mouse meninges contain a pool of monocytes and neutrophils supplied not from the blood but by adjacent skull and vertebral bone marrow. Under pathological conditions, including spinal cord injury and neuroinflammation, CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells can originate from brain borders and display transcriptional signatures distinct from their blood-derived counterparts. Thus, CNS borders are populated by myeloid cells from adjacent bone marrow niches, strategically placed to supply innate immune cells under homeostatic and pathological conditions. These findings call for a reinterpretation of immune-cell infiltration into the CNS during injury and autoimmunity and may inform future therapeutic approaches that harness meningeal immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W3165520347,"The meninges contain adaptive immune cells that provide immunosurveillance of the central nervous system (CNS). These cells are thought to derive from the systemic circulation. Through single-cell analyses, confocal imaging, bone marrow chimeras, and parabiosis experiments, we show that meningeal B cells derive locally from the calvaria, which harbors a bone marrow niche for hematopoiesis. B cells reach the meninges from the calvaria through specialized vascular connections. This calvarial-meningeal path of B cell development may provide the CNS with a constant supply of B cells educated by CNS antigens. Conversely, we show that a subset of antigen-experienced B cells that populate the meninges in aging mice are blood-borne. These results identify a private source for meningeal B cells, which may help maintain immune privilege within the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W3166719420,"Estimating an epidemic's trajectory is crucial for developing public health responses to infectious diseases, but case data used for such estimation are confounded by variable testing practices. We show that the population distribution of viral loads observed under random or symptom-based surveillance-in the form of cycle threshold (Ct) values obtained from reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing-changes during an epidemic. Thus, Ct values from even limited numbers of random samples can provide improved estimates of an epidemic's trajectory. Combining data from multiple such samples improves the precision and robustness of this estimation. We apply our methods to Ct values from surveillance conducted during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in a variety of settings and offer alternative approaches for real-time estimates of epidemic trajectories for outbreak management and response."
https://openalex.org/W3164232357,"Resistance represents a major challenge for antibody-based therapy for COVID-191-4. Here we engineered an immunoglobulin M (IgM) neutralizing antibody (IgM-14) to overcome the resistance encountered by immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based therapeutics. IgM-14 is over 230-fold more potent than its parental IgG-14 in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. IgM-14 potently neutralizes the resistant virus raised by its corresponding IgG-14, three variants of concern-B.1.1.7 (Alpha, which first emerged in the UK), P.1 (Gamma, which first emerged in Brazil) and B.1.351 (Beta, which first emerged in South Africa)-and 21 other receptor-binding domain mutants, many of which are resistant to the IgG antibodies that have been authorized for emergency use. Although engineering IgG into IgM enhances antibody potency in general, selection of an optimal epitope is critical for identifying the most effective IgM that can overcome resistance. In mice, a single intranasal dose of IgM-14 at 0.044 mg per kg body weight confers prophylactic efficacy and a single dose at 0.4 mg per kg confers therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. IgM-14, but not IgG-14, also confers potent therapeutic protection against the P.1 and B.1.351 variants. IgM-14 exhibits desirable pharmacokinetics and safety profiles when administered intranasally in rodents. Our results show that intranasal administration of an engineered IgM can improve efficacy, reduce resistance and simplify the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3165839825,"It is widely hypothesized that removing cellular transfer RNAs (tRNAs)-making their cognate codons unreadable-might create a genetic firewall to viral infection and enable sense codon reassignment. However, it has been impossible to test these hypotheses. In this work, following synonymous codon compression and laboratory evolution in Escherichia coli, we deleted the tRNAs and release factor 1, which normally decode two sense codons and a stop codon; the resulting cells could not read the canonical genetic code and were completely resistant to a cocktail of viruses. We reassigned these codons to enable the efficient synthesis of proteins containing three distinct noncanonical amino acids. Notably, we demonstrate the facile reprogramming of our cells for the encoded translation of diverse noncanonical heteropolymers and macrocycles."

The GRB itself lasts only a few seconds but is followed by an afterglow that can persist for hours or days. The H.E.S.S. Collaboration observed the afterglow of GRB 190829A, a nearby long GRB. The proximity of this burst allowed it to be detected at tera–electron volt energies that would otherwise be absorbed in the intergalactic medium. By analyzing the spectrum and light curve at x-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths, the authors show that the afterglow cannot be explained by standard models. Science , abe8560, this issue p. 1081"
https://openalex.org/W3164087747,"Although antiviral antibodies generally confer protective functions, antibodies against dengue virus (DENV) are associated with enhanced disease susceptibility. Antibodies can mediate DENV infection of leukocytes via Fcγ receptors, likely contributing to dengue disease pathogenesis. To determine if this mechanism accounts for variable disease severity, we examined Fab and Fc structures of anti-DENV antibodies from patients before and after infection and with variable disease outcomes. Neither antibody titers nor neutralizing activity correlated with disease severity in DENV-infected populations. Rather, DENV infection induced a specific increase in immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) afucosylation, and the levels of afucosylated IgG1 were predictive of dengue disease severity. Thus, the IgG1 fucosylation status represents a robust prognostic tool for dengue disease, highlighting the key role of the Fc glycan structure in dengue pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3164001450,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of COVID-19, uses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) for the replication of its genome and the transcription of its genes. We found that the catalytic subunit of the RdRp, nsp12, ligates two iron-sulfur metal cofactors in sites that were modeled as zinc centers in the available cryo-electron microscopy structures of the RdRp complex. These metal binding sites are essential for replication and for interaction with the viral helicase. Oxidation of the clusters by the stable nitroxide TEMPOL caused their disassembly, potently inhibited the RdRp, and blocked SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. These iron-sulfur clusters thus serve as cofactors for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and are targets for therapy of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3164090582,"Whereas coding variants often have pleiotropic effects across multiple tissues, noncoding variants are thought to mediate their phenotypic effects by specific tissue and temporal regulation of gene expression. Here, we investigated the genetic and functional architecture of a genomic region within the FTO gene that is strongly associated with obesity risk. We show that multiple variants on a common haplotype modify the regulatory properties of several enhancers targeting IRX3 and IRX5 from megabase distances. We demonstrate that these enhancers affect gene expression in multiple tissues, including adipose and brain, and impart regulatory effects during a restricted temporal window. Our data indicate that the genetic architecture of disease-associated loci may involve extensive pleiotropy, allelic heterogeneity, shared allelic effects across tissues, and temporally restricted effects."

https://openalex.org/W3164418011,"Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly common in the adult population. In the United States, the overall burden of NAFLD is unknown due to challenges with population-level NAFLD detection. The purpose of this study was to estimate prevalence of NAFLD and significant NAFLD fibrosis and identify factors associated with them in the U.S. Methods Data came from the 2017–2018 cycle of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We defined NAFLD by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) scores of ≥248 dB/m in absence of excessive alcohol use and viral hepatitis. We defined significant fibrosis as Vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE) liver stiffness measurements (LSM) value ≥7.9 kPa. We calculated the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidential intervals (CI) for associations with NAFLD and significant NAFLD fibrosis using multivariable logistic regression. Results Overall, among 4,024 individuals aged ≥20 years included in the analysis, 56.7% had NAFLD by CAP. In comparison, when defined by elevated liver enzymes, NAFLD prevalence was 12.4%. The prevalence of significant NAFLD fibrosis by VCTE LSM was 14.5%. NAFLD prevalence increased with age, was higher among men than women and among Hispanics compared with non-Hispanic whites. Individuals who were obese, had metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes were more likely to have NAFLD compared to those that who were not obese or without MetS/diabetes. Inadequate physical activity (OR = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.18–2.08) was also a factor associated with NAFLD. MetS, high waist circumstance, diabetes and hypertension were independently associated with significant NAFLD fibrosis. Conclusions NAFLD and significant NAFLD fibrosis are highly prevalent in U.S. general population."

https://openalex.org/W3164023991,"Cross-presentation of antigens from dead tumor cells by type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) is thought to underlie priming of anti-cancer CD8+ T cells. cDC1 express high levels of DNGR-1 (a.k.a. CLEC9A), a receptor that binds to F-actin exposed by dead cell debris and promotes cross-presentation of associated antigens. Here, we show that secreted gelsolin (sGSN), an extracellular protein, decreases DNGR-1 binding to F-actin and cross-presentation of dead cell-associated antigens by cDC1s. Mice deficient in sGsn display increased DNGR-1-dependent resistance to transplantable tumors, especially ones expressing neoantigens associated with the actin cytoskeleton, and exhibit greater responsiveness to cancer immunotherapy. In human cancers, lower levels of intratumoral sGSN transcripts, as well as presence of mutations in proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton, are associated with signatures of anti-cancer immunity and increased patient survival. Our results reveal a natural barrier to cross-presentation of cancer antigens that dampens anti-tumor CD8+ T cell responses."

https://openalex.org/W3165743373,"Making sense of TCR–pMHC topology Most T cells use a T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes major histocompatibility complex molecules bound to peptides (pMHCs) derived from both self- and foreign antigens. Although there is great variability in the interface because of the diversity of both partners, this interaction displays a canonical docking topology for reasons that remain contested. Zareie et al. tested an assortment of both canonical and reversed-polarity TCRs that were all specific for the same cognate pMHC-I bearing a peptide derived from influenza A virus (IAV) (see the Perspective by Horkova and Stepanek). The authors determined that docking topology was the primary driver of in vivo T cell activation and recruitment when mice were infected with IAV. The canonical topology was required for the formation of a functional signaling complex, suggesting that T cell signaling constraints dictate how TCR and pMHC meet.

https://openalex.org/W3164571028,"Methods to enhance adult neurogenesis by reprogramming glial cells into neurons enable production of new neurons in the adult nervous system. Development of therapeutically viable approaches to induce new neurons is now required to bring this concept to clinical application. Here, we successfully generate new neurons in the cortex and dentate gyrus of the aged adult mouse brain by transiently suppressing polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 using an antisense oligonucleotide delivered by a single injection into cerebral spinal fluid. Radial glial-like cells and other GFAP-expressing cells convert into new neurons that, over a 2-month period, acquire mature neuronal character in a process mimicking normal neuronal maturation. The new neurons functionally integrate into endogenous circuits and modify mouse behavior. Thus, generation of new neurons in the dentate gyrus of the aging brain can be achieved with a therapeutically feasible approach, thereby opening prospects for production of neurons to replace those lost to neurodegenerative disease. Maimon et al. demonstrate a therapeutically viable approach, single-dose injection of a DNA drug to suppress synthesis of PTB, to generate new neurons in the aged mouse hippocampus and enhance memory after their integration into endogenous circuits."
https://openalex.org/W3164622592,"DNA methylation is associated with transcriptional repression of eukaryotic genes and transposons, but the downstream mechanism of gene silencing is largely unknown. Here we describe two Arabidopsis methyl-CpG binding domain proteins, MBD5 and MBD6, that are recruited to chromatin by recognition of CG methylation, and redundantly repress a subset of genes and transposons without affecting DNA methylation levels. These methyl-readers recruit a ﻿J-domain protein, SILENZIO, that acts as a transcriptional repressor in loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments. J-domain proteins often serve as co-chaperones with HSP70s. Indeed, we found that SILENZIO's conserved J-domain motif was required for its interaction with HSP70s and for its silencing function. These results uncover an unprecedented role of a molecular chaperone J-domain protein in gene silencing downstream of DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W3165811727,"Mammalian medial and lateral hippocampal networks preferentially process spatial- and object-related information, respectively. However, the mechanisms underlying the assembly of such parallel networks during development remain largely unknown. Our study shows that, in mice, complementary expression of cell surface molecules teneurin-3 (Ten3) and latrophilin-2 (Lphn2) in the medial and lateral hippocampal networks, respectively, guides the precise assembly of CA1-to-subiculum connections in both networks. In the medial network, Ten3-expressing (Ten3+) CA1 axons are repelled by target-derived Lphn2, revealing that Lphn2- and Ten3-mediated heterophilic repulsion and Ten3-mediated homophilic attraction cooperate to control precise target selection of CA1 axons. In the lateral network, Lphn2-expressing (Lphn2+) CA1 axons are confined to Lphn2+ targets via repulsion from Ten3+ targets. Our findings demonstrate that assembly of parallel hippocampal networks follows a ""Ten3→Ten3, Lphn2→Lphn2"" rule instructed by reciprocal repulsions."
https://openalex.org/W3164860532,"Dysregulation in contextual processing is believed to affect several forms of psychopathology, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The dentate gyrus (DG), a subregion of the hippocampus, is thought to be an important brain region for disambiguating new experiences from prior experiences. Noradrenergic (NE) neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) are more tonically active during stressful events and send dense projections to the DG, yet an understanding of their function in DG-dependent contextual discrimination has not been established. Here, we isolate a key function of the LC-NE-DG circuit in contextual aversive generalization using selective manipulations and in vivo single-cell calcium imaging. We report that activation of LC-NE neurons and terminal activity results in contextual generalization. We found that these effects required β-adrenergic-mediated modulation of hilar interneurons to ultimately promote aversive generalization, suggesting that disruption of noradrenergic tone may serve as an important avenue for treating stress-induced disorders."

We present evidence for a previously unknown major extinction event in sharks that occurred in the early Miocene, ~19 million years ago. During this interval, sharks virtually disappeared from open-ocean sediments, declining in abundance by >90% and morphological diversity by >70%, an event from which they never recovered. This abrupt extinction occurred independently from any known global climate event and ~2 million to 5 million years before diversifications in the highly migratory, large-bodied predators that dominate pelagic ecosystems today, indicating that the early Miocene was a period of rapid, transformative change for open-ocean ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3165866860,"This paper estimates the benefits and costs of state suppression policies to “bend the curve” during the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States. We employ an approach that values benefits and costs in terms of additions or subtractions to total production. Relative to a baseline in which only the infected and at-risk populations mitigate the spread of coronavirus, we estimate that total benefits of suppression policies to economic output are between $632.5 billion and $765.0 billion from early March 2020 to August 1, 2020. Relative to private mitigation, output lost due to suppression policies is estimated to be between $214.2 billion and $331.5 billion. The cost estimate is based on the duration of nonessential business closures and stay-at-home orders, which were enforced between 42 and 65 days. Our results indicate that the net benefits of suppression policies to slow the spread of COVID-19 are positive and may be substantial. We discuss uncertainty surrounding several parameters and employ alternative methods for valuing mortality benefits, which also suggest that suppression measures had positive net benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3155012455,"Emotions and temperature are closely related through embodied processes, and people seem to associate temperature concepts with emotions. While this relationship is often evidenced by everyday language (e.g., cold and warm feelings), what remains missing to date is a systematic study that holistically analyzes how and why people associate specific temperatures with emotions. The present research aimed to investigate the associations between temperature concepts and emotion adjectives on both explicit and implicit levels. In Experiment 1, we evaluated explicit associations between twelve pairs of emotion adjectives derived from the circumplex model of affect, and five different temperature concepts ranging from 0°C to 40°C, based on responses from 403 native speakers of four different languages (English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese). The results of Experiment 1 revealed that, across languages, the temperatures were associated with different regions of the circumplex model. The 0°C and 10°C were associated with negative-valanced, low-arousal emotions, while 20°C was associated with positive-valanced, low-to-medium-arousal emotions. Moreover, 30°C was associated with positive-valanced, high-arousal emotions; and 40°C was associated with high-arousal and either positive- or negative-valanced emotions. In Experiment 2 (N = 102), we explored whether these temperature-emotion associations were also present at the implicit level, by conducting Implicit Association Tests (IATs) with temperature words (cold and hot) and opposing pairs of emotional adjectives for each dimension of valence (Unhappy/Dissatisfied vs. Happy/Satisfied) and arousal (Passive/Quiet vs. Active/Alert) on native English speakers. The results of Experiment 2 revealed that participants held implicit associations between the word hot and positive-valanced and high-arousal emotions. Additionally, the word cold was associated with negative-valanced and low-arousal emotions. These findings provide evidence for the existence of temperature-emotion associations at both explicit and implicit levels across languages."

Cofactor recruitment is thereby interconnected with oligomerization status as well as ligand occupation of the partnering LBD through allosteric cross talk. Here we present a modular set of homogeneous time-resolved FRET–based assays through which we investigated the activation of PPARγ in response to ligands and the formation of heterodimers with its obligatory partner RXRα. We introduced mutations into the RXRα LBD that prevent coactivator binding but do not interfere with LBD dimerization or ligand binding. This enabled us to specifically detect PPARγ coactivator recruitment to PPARγ:RXRα heterodimers. We found that the RXRα agonist SR11237 destabilized the RXRα homodimer but promoted formation of the PPARγ:RXRα heterodimer, while being inactive on PPARγ itself. Of interest, incorporation of PPARγ into the heterodimer resulted in a substantial gain in affinity for coactivator CBP-1, even in the absence of ligands.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is the most explored of the three subtypes being in the focus of biochemical, structural, and pharmaceutical research for decades. After almost all approved PPARγ ligands from the thiazolidinone class were withdrawn from the market owing to adverse effects, a variety of modulators that overcome the drawbacks of classical full agonists were developed. In terms of pharmacology, partial agonists and antagonists have been developed, paving the way for a resurrection of PPARγ as an attractive pharmacological target. However, current pharmacological models do not fully reflect the complexity of PPARγ modulation by various ligands. Heterodimers formed between PPARγ and its obligatory dimer partner retinoid X receptor α (RXRα) can activate transcription of target genes in response to ligands specific to either of the dimer partners’ ligand-binding domain (LBD). Hence, modulation of heterodimer formation has major influence on target gene expression or repression and thus modulates the gene expression in response to ligands. Dissociation of the RXR:RXR homodimer allows for the formation of the PPARγ:RXR heterodimer. But as RXR is also a potential heterodimer partner for a variety of other nuclear receptors (21 in case of RXRα (5Amoutzias G.D. Pichler E.E. Mian N. De Graaf D. Imsiridou A. Robinson-Rechavi M.

Several examples illustrate the complexity of the underlying modulation of the PPARγ:RXR heterodimer.

Furthermore, insulin sensitizing effects were documented for the RXR ligand LG100754, which antagonizes the transactivation of target genes of the RXR:RXR homodimer but acts as an agonist on heterodimers of RXR with PPARα, PPARγ, or PPARδ (9Cesario R.M.

These studies demonstrate that simultaneous treatment with agonists specific for both PPARγ and RXR may result in a synergistic pharmacological effect. Classical assay technologies for nuclear receptors that are used for screening and ligand characterization in drug discovery often rely either on cofactor recruitment to the recombinantly expressed isolated LBD or on transactivation of reporter genes by Gal4-LBD chimera. In this type of assays the activity of the nuclear receptor (NR) in terms of coactivator recruitment or transactivation of reporter genes is detected independently of the oligomerization status of the LBD. Thus, it is not possible to differentiate if detected activity relates to monomeric LBD or to LBD dimers. In addition, these assays lack the possibility to study how ligands modulate the complex process of RXR:RXR homodimer dissociation and heterodimer formation. In this study we provide insights into how diverse agonists and antagonists of RXR and PPAR modulate formation and activation of the RXR:PPAR heterodimer, which holds important implications for future drug discovery targeting nuclear receptors. To probe the relative affinities of the three PPAR subtypes to RXRα, we constructed a homogeneous time-resolved FRET (HTRF)-based assay for investigation of heterodimer formation between the LBDs of the PPARs and the LBD of their obligatory dimer partner RXRα. RXRα was labeled with biotin via an N-terminal Avi-tag and subsequently coupled to streptavidin labeled with Terbium cryptate (Tb-SA). The latter was utilized as the FRET donor fluorophore. The PPAR LBDs were expressed with N-terminal superfolder green fluorescent protein (sGFP) that functions as the FRET acceptor. We then titrated sGFP-PPAR LBD to up to 4.8 μM until saturation in HTRF indicated maximal complex formation (Fig. 1). In order to suppress secondary effects caused by variation of sGFP concentration and its influence on diffusion-enhanced FRET we used free sGFP to keep the total sGFP concentration constant at 4.8 μM. Proper dimer formation capability of all PPAR protein preparations was validated via a pulldown experiment (Figs. S1 and S2). Separate control experiments showed that, in this experimental setup, an increase in the HTRF signal correlates with the binding of sGFP-PPAR to RXRα-LBD. When the latter was not coupled to Tb-SA owing to an excess of free biotin in the sample, then the HTRF signal obtained was the same as for the control with no RXRα being present (Fig. S3). The three PPAR subtypes differed substantially in their observed affinity for binding to the RXRα LBD (p < 0.0001 in sum-of-squares F-test). PPARδ showed the lowest affinity with a Kd of 363 nM. Second in the order was PPARα with about five times higher affinity to RXRα (Kd = 72 nM). The highest affinity was observed for PPARγ with a Kd of 15 nM, which is another factor five higher. Since the heterodimer formation between RXRα and PPARγ exhibited the lowest dissociation constant we further concentrated on investigating factors that modulate this heterodimer. Next we investigated the influence of PPARγ ligands on the formation of the heterodimer with RXRα. To examine the effect of saturating the PPARγ LBD with any of its ligands, the PPARγ LBD was kept at a constant low concentration. Consequently, we inverted the setup and coupled PPARγ to the FRET donor. RXRα as a fusion protein with sGFP was titrated, whereas all other factors were kept constant. Again, separate control experiments were conducted, which provided evidence that an increase in HTRF correlated with the formation of the heterodimer (Fig. S4). And, when activated by its reference agonist rosiglitazone, the utilized biotin-labeled PPARγ recruited a fluorescein-labeled peptide derived from coactivator CBP-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. S5). This showed that coupling to Tb-SA does not compromise the function of the LBD. Incubation with a fixed concentration of 1 μM PPARγ full agonist GW1929, partial agonist INT131, or reference agonist rosiglitazone resulted in distinct shifts of the titration curves compared with the apo experiment (p < 0.0014 (INT131); p < 0.0001 (Rosi; GW1929) in sum-of-squares F-test). GW1929 caused a 3-fold reduction of the apparent Kd of heterodimer formation, thereby promoting the dimerization of the PPARγ LBD and the RXRα LBD. The reference agonist rosiglitazone reduced the Kd by a factor of 2. Incubation with INT131, which is a partial agonist of PPARγ, resulted in an only minor stabilization of the heterodimer (Fig. 2). The PPARγ antagonists SR1664 and GW9662 did not affect heterodimer formation (Fig. S6). RXRα does not only function as an obligatory heterodimer partner for other nuclear receptors but can also form homodimers on its own. Therefore, we investigated the modulatory effect of the RXRα agonist SR11237 (BMS 649) on the stability of the RXRα homodimer. For this purpose we utilized the biotin-labeled RXRα LBD from the first series of experiments and the sGFP-RXRα from the second one (see Figs. 1A, 2A, and 3A for schematic representation of the assay setup). In the experiment on homodimer formation (Fig. 3B) the upper plateau was not reached in the presence of 10 μM SR11237. However, the data from the apo experiment indicate that the upper plateau is reached once RXRα homodimer formation is fully achieved. In the experiment with SR11237 the compound was present at a constant concentration of 10 μM. No shift of the lower plateau was observed in comparison with the apo experiment. Hence, 10 μM SR11237 does not affect HTRF readout. The lower plateau results from diffusion-enhanced FRET, which in turn depends on the concentration of FRET donor and FRET acceptor, which are both kept constant throughout the entire experiment. The increase in HTRF upon complex formation depends on the particular complex formed and the concentration thereof. In this set of experiments the maximal concentration of FRET productive complex depends on the concentration of the FRET donor–coupled RXRα. These parameters were all identical in the apo experiment and the experiment with 10 μM SR11237. It is therefore reasonable to assume that also in presence of 10 μM SR11237 the curve would trend toward the upper plateau seen in the apo experiment. Henceforth, we utilized the upper plateau from the apo curve as a fixed parameter for fitting of the SR11237 data. Of interest, binding of RXRα agonist SR11237 significantly destabilized the homodimer, which is reflected in an increase in the apparent Kd (p = 0.0083; 99% confidence interval [CI]; n = 3; N = 3 each; Fig. 3B). For RXRα in complex with SR11237 (BMS 649) and a coactivator peptide two different crystal structures have been reported. Both show RXRα in agonist-bound active conformation, but the RXRα LBD is present either as an LBD monomer or as an LBD homodimer, respectively (11Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Moras D. Molecular recognition of agonist ligands by RXRs.Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 987-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This supports the assumption that SR11237 reduces the stability of the RXRα LBD homodimer under various experimental conditions. Based on this observation, we then evaluated the modulatory effect of SR11237 on the formation of the PPARγ:RXRα heterodimer. In contrast to the destabilizing effect on the homodimer the RXRα agonist showed a significant stabilizing effect on the PPARγ:RXRα heterodimer as reflected in a reduction in the apparent Kd (p = 0.0007; 99% CI; n = 3; N = 3 each; Fig. 3C). The main function of nuclear receptors is the recruitment of transcription coregulators to specific DNA response elements. In in vitro assays this is reflected by the recruitment of small peptides that are derived from coactivators or negative regulators of transcription (corepressors). In order to investigate coactivator recruitment by the isolated PPARγ LBD we coupled the biotin-labeled CBP-1 peptide to terbium-labeled streptavidin and detected the recruitment to the sGFP-PPARγ LBD in response to ligands. In this setup both FRET partners are present at a constant concentration, and hence, diffusion-enhanced FRET is not a matter of concern. The optimal concentration of sGFP-PPARγ LBD for this assay type was evaluated in a separate control experiment (Fig. S7). When titrated in the presence of its reference agonist rosiglitazone a concentration of 100 nM sGFP-PPARγ resulted in a substantial gain in FRET. At this concentration the apo titration series did still show almost no increase in comparison with the baseline in HTRF detected with lower sGFP-PPARγ concentrations or no protein at all. Therefore, 100 nM was chosen as the default LBD concentration in all further LBD monomer cofactor recruitment assays. Rosiglitazone activated CBP-1 recruitment with an EC50 of 91 nM, and its maximal efficacy was set to 100%. GW1929 promoted recruitment with an EC50 of 44 nM and comparable efficacy. The partial agonist INT131 mediates less cofactor recruitment, which is indicated by a higher EC50 and impaired maximal efficacy of 19% compared with rosiglitazone (p < 0.0021 for efficacy and p < 0.0001 for EC50 in sum-of-squares F-test; Fig. 4B, Table 1).Table 1Overview of potency and efficacy of all PPARγ ligands tested for modulation of CBP-1 recruitment by the PPARγ LBD either on isolated PPARγ LBD (monomer recruitment) or in the context of PPARγ LBD in complex with RXRα LBD (dimer recruitment)LigandMonomer recruitmentDimer recruitmentAgonist modePotency (EC50)Efficacy (%)Potency (EC50)Efficacy (%)Rosi91 ± 8 nMaIn order to provide information on reproducibility and robustness of the assays, the experiments with reference agonist rosiglitazone were repeated in four independent experiments (n = 4; each with N = 3).

EC50 and IC50 values are reported with SD. In the antagonist mode of the cofactor recruitment assay PPARγ is constantly activated by 1 μM rosiglitazone, which corresponds to approx. EC80. These conditions were used to investigate the known antagonists SR1664 and GW9662 for their potential to impede activation by rosiglitazone and, hence, reverse CBP-1 recruitment. Both antagonists were able to fully inhibit coactivator recruitment. GW9662 showed an IC50 of 1.2 μM, and SR1664 of 0.8 μM (Fig. 4C, Table 1). Next, we intended to determine whether the increased heterodimer formation in response to incubation with RXRα agonist SR11237 can be explained exclusively with selective binding to RXRα. Therefore, we probed the effect of SR11237 on PPARγ in the monomer cofactor recruitment assay (scheme as in Fig. 4A). As shown in Figure 5, SR11237 neither activated recruitment of CBP-1 by PPARγ nor impaired rosiglitazone-mediated recruitment. In this study, we aimed to investigate PPARγ coactivator recruitment in the context of the LBD:LBD heterodimer with RXRα. As both nuclear receptors are able to recruit cofactors a recruitment-incapable RXRα LBD mutant had to be designed. Hence, we analyzed the AF-2 coactivator-binding site (ligand-dependent activation function 2) in the structure of agonist-bound RXRα published by Zhang et al.; Figure 6 (12Zhang H. Xu X. Chen L. Chen J. Hu L. Jiang H. Shen X. Molecular determinants of magnolol targeting both RXRα and PPARγ.PLoS One. 2011; 6e28253Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The residues of the coactivator consensus motif LXXLL bind to a hydrophobic groove. Residues Val280, Val298, and Phe450 contribute to the hydrophobic surface of this groove and form van-der-Waals contacts with the leucine residues of the coactivator-derived peptide. The binding groove is flanked by Lys284 and Glu453 that form a charge clamp stabilizing the dipole of the coactivator helix (13Wu Y. Chin W.W. Wang Y. Burris T.P. Ligand and coactivator identity determines the requirement of the charge clamp for coactivation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8637-8644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic residues were mutated to Thr in case of Val 280 and 298, or Tyr in case of Phe 450. In this way the mutations were rather conservative with only one additional –OH being introduced each. This should disrupt the hydrophobic area. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of introducing charge clamp mutations Lys284Glu and Glu453Arg, which should invert the distribution of the most important charges that flank the coactivator-binding groove. The following mutants were generated: the VVF mutant (V280T + V298T + F450Y); two single mutants E453R and K284E, as well as the total mutant harboring all five exchanges. All mutants were examined for their interaction with PPARγ LBD (Figure 7; Fig. S8). The total mutant differed least from wt RXRα in terms of the apparent Kd for heterodimer formation. Since such unchanged interaction with PPARγ was the most important criterion for use in later assay setups, the total mutant was selected and further characterized. A modified Gal4 transactivation assay was used to assess RXRα wt and RXRα mutant in their ability to recruit PPARγ LBD in a cellular context. A schematic depiction of this assay is shown in Fig. S9. RXRα LBD is expressed as a fusion protein with Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) that guides RXRα to the Gal4 DNA response elements in the promoter region of the firefly reporter gene. The PPARγ LBD is expressed as a fusion protein with VP16, a strong trans-inducer of transcription (14Hirai H. Tani T. Kikyo N. Structure and functions of powerful transactivators: VP16, MyoD and FoxA.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2010; 54: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Formation of the RXRα:PPARγ heterodimer results in recruitment of VP16 to the Gal4 response elements and subsequently activates expression of firefly luciferase (Luc). HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids for the firefly Luc reporter and constitutively expressed Renilla Luc, which served as an internal control. Cotransfection of either Gal4-RXRα wildtype (wt) or Gal4-RXRα mutant alone did not enhance expression of firefly Luc (Fig. 8). When only VP16-PPARγ was cotransfected, activity of firefly Luc was enhanced approximately 100-fold. The combination of VP16-PPARγ and Gal4-RXRα resulted in an additional approximately 100-fold increase. This was observed for both RXRα wt and the RXRα mutant and showed that the introduced mutations do not alter dimer formation between RXRα and PPARγ. We used the monomer coactivator recruitment assay to validate that the introduced mutations indeed prevent coactivator recruitment by RXRα in response to SR11237 (Fig. 9). To further validate this, we employed another variation of the cell-based Gal4 transactivation assay. When activated by one of its ligands, Gal4-RXRα wt can recruit components of the transcription machinery thereby promoting transcription of the reporter gene (firefly Luc). But RXRα LBD is also an obligate heterodimer partner for various other NRs. Henceforth, ligand-dependent activation of RXRα could in principle not only cause recruitment of coactivators but also modulate various other interactions that influence transactivation. In order to intensify the gain in transactivation that is directly related to the recruitment of a coactivator we, therefore, cotransfected a plasmid for expression of VP16 coupled to SRC1 coactivator motif 2. Control experiments showed that, in the absence of an RXRα agonist, coexpression of Gal4-RXRα does not promote transactivation in comparison with cells expressing only VP16-SRC1 (Fig. S10). Stimulation with SR11237 in the same setting resulted in a substantial increase in transactivation of reporter gene expression. And at ≥ 0.1 μM SR11237 transactivation by the RXRα mutant was markedly reduced in comparison with RXRα wt (Fig. 10). This provided further evidence that the mutations prevent coactivator recruitment. However, also on cells transfected with the RXRα mutant stimulation with SR11237 resulted in a substantial increase in transactivation compared with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control. This indicates that the mutations do not prevent binding of SR11237. In order to reassure that the inability of the RXRα total mutant LBD to recruit the SRC1 cofactor peptide is not caused by a defect in ligand binding, direct binding of the reference agonist SR11237 was examined using isothermal titration calorimetry. The experiments confirmed that both the wildtype as well as the total mutant LBD bind SR11237 with comparable affinity (Figs. S11 and S12). Utilizing the RXRα LBD total mutant we set up an assay to specifically trace the coactivator recruitment of PPARγ LBD in the context of the LBD:LBD heterodimer. Based on the Kd values observed in previous experiments (Figs. 2 and 3), a fixed concentration of 2 μM sGFP-coupled RXRα LBD total mutant was deemed sufficient to ensure that under all conditions investigated at least 90% of PPARγ LBD is bound in the heterodimer with RXRα. In contrast to the monomer recruitment assay, PPARγ now lacks the sGFP-tag, and hence, only the fraction incorporated in the heterodimer can produce a HTRF signal upon coactivator binding; scheme in Figure 11. In comparison with coactivator recruitment by the isolated monomeric PPARγ LBD we found in the heterodimer setting that the EC50 observed for GW1929 increased by about 2-fold, whereas the EC50 values of rosiglitazone and INT131 were unaffected. The IC50 values observed for the PPARγ antagonists SR1664 and GW9662 when tested against 1 μM rosiglitazone (approximately EC80) were 2- to 4-fold higher in the context of the heterodimer (Table 1; Fig. S13). Furthermore, we observed that, in comparison with the monomer coactivator recruitment assay the assay window happened to be much smaller when testing PPARγ activation in the context of the heterodimer with RXRα as shown in Fig. S14 for the activation with rosiglitazone. Therefore, we investigated to which extent the formation of the dimer affects basal coactivator recruitment by PPARγ. As in the monomer recruitment assay, we observed CBP-1 recruitment by PPARγ coupled to sGFP, but titrated free RXRα total mutant LBD instead of ligand (Fig. 12). Upon formation of the heterodimer with RXRα the basal affinity of PPARγ for the CBP-1 peptide increased substantially. Next we investigated whether activation of RXRα by SR11237 modulates coactivator recruitment by PPARγ in response to activation by rosiglitazone. We used 50 μM SR11237 to ensure saturation of RXRα (2 μM) in this setting. Basal and upper plateaus were comparable between both experiments, with the latter indicating maximal activation of PPARγ to be reached. Therefore, the curves were fitted to a scale of 0% to 100% of observed gain in CBP-1 recruitment. The dose–response curves revealed that EC5"

The primary objective was overall response rate by RECIST 1.1 criteria. Secondary objectives included safety, progression-free survival, time to progression, duration of response and overall survival.An interim analysis for futility was performed at 18 evaluable patients. Overall response rate was 60%, duration of response was 4.9 months and time to progression was 5.2 months. Progression-free survival at 6 and 12 months was 43% and 5%. Median progression-free survival was 6.2 months and median overall survival was 11.3 months. In all patients, CA125 levels reflected response and progression. There were no pseudoprogression events. After receiving palliative radiation during pembrolizumab maintenance, a patient with recurrent ovarian clear cell carcinoma had an exceptional and durable response that is ongoing for greater than 2 years. After consultation with the sponsor, based on the modest duration of response observed at the interim analysis for futility, the decision was made to close the trial to further accrual.The addition of pembrolizumab to cisplatin and gemcitabine did not appear to provide benefit beyond chemotherapy alone in patients with recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3164242559,"Because negative findings have less chance of getting published, available studies tend to be a biased sample. This leads to an inflation of effect size estimates to an unknown degree. To see how meta-analyses in education account for publication bias, we surveyed all meta-analyses published in the last five years in the Review of Educational Research and Educational Research Review. The results show that meta-analyses usually neglect publication bias adjustment. In the minority of meta-analyses adjusting for bias, mostly non-principled adjustment methods were used, and only rarely were the conclusions based on corrected estimates, rendering the adjustment inconsequential. It is argued that appropriate state-of-the-art adjustment (e.g., selection models) should be attempted by default, yet one needs to take into account the uncertainty inherent in any meta-analytic inference under bias. We conclude by providing practical recommendations on dealing with publication bias."

External validation was performed on an independent test set of 558 images. A ground-truth label was assigned to each image by a panel of cornea specialists. We constructed a deep transfer learning network that consisted of a pre-trained network and an adaptation layer. In this work, five pre-trained networks were considered, namely VGG-16, ResNet-101, Inception V3, Xception, and Inception-ResNet V2. The performance of each transfer network was evaluated by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and G mean.The best performance was achieved by Inception-ResNet V2 transfer model. In the validation set, the best transfer system achieved an AUC of 0.9646 (P<0.001) in identifying activated dendritic cells (accuracy, 0.9319; sensitivity, 0.8171; specificity, 0.9517; and G mean, 0.8872), and 0.9901 (P<0.001) in identifying inflammatory cells (accuracy, 0.9767; sensitivity, 0.9174; specificity, 0.9931; and G mean, 0.9545).The deep transfer learning models provide a completely automated analysis of corneal inflammatory cellular components with high accuracy. The implementation of such models would greatly benefit the management of corneal diseases and reduce workloads for ophthalmologists."

Firstly, the obtained empirical data make it possible to estimate the prevalence of compensative and compulsive buying among the general population of Poles aged 15 years old and over, with the sample split into users and non-users of the e-commerce market offer. Secondly, the conducted analysis shows to what extent the prevalence of compulsive and compensative buying is differentiated by the frequency of online shopping, by the extent of the expenditures on online shopping compared with offline shopping, by attitudes towards online shopping, and by sociodemographic conditions (gender, age, monthly net income of household). The findings come from a survey conducted in 2019 based on a nationwide statistically representative sample of 1,000 Poles aged 15 years old and over. Drawing on this survey based on the German Compulsive Buying Indicator (GCBI), the prevalence of compulsive buying is observed at about 3% and compensative buying at about 12%. Dividing the general population into online and offline shoppers, one can see serious differences between both target groups; the share of compulsive and compensative buyers in the segment of online shoppers amounts to 3.6% and 16.9%, while among non-online shoppers- 3.3% and 10.1%. The strongest susceptibility to compulsive buying is characteristic of female online shoppers having very positive attitudes towards online shopping and doing online shopping very frequently."
https://openalex.org/W3165200239,"Female sex workers are highly mobile, which may influence their risk of experiencing physical and sexual violence. However, there remains a paucity of research, particularly longitudinal, from Sub-Saharan Africa exploring mobility and gender-based violence among female sex workers. To address this gap, this study examined the longitudinal relationship between work-related mobility and recent experience of physical or sexual gender-based violence from a client or partner among female sex workers in Iringa, Tanzania. A secondary data analysis was conducted using baseline and 18-month follow-up data from Project Shikamana, a community empowerment-based combination HIV prevention intervention. Responses from 387 female sex workers aged 18 years and older participating in both baseline and follow-up were analyzed. Unadjusted and adjusted Poisson regression models with robust variance estimations, accounting for clustering of female sex workers' responses over time, were fit. Final models adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics and aspects of participants' living situations and work environments. Recent physical or sexual violence from a client or partner was common (baseline: 40%; follow-up: 29%). Twenty-six percent of female sex workers at baseline, and 11% at follow-up, had recently traveled outside of Iringa for sex work. In the final adjusted longitudinal model, female sex workers recently mobile for sex work had a 25% increased risk of any recent experience of physical or sexual gender-based violence when compared with their non-mobile counterparts (adjusted incidence rate ratio: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.03-1.53; p<0.05). Interventions must identify ways-such as mobile support services, linkages and referrals to health and other social services while traveling, or the use of mobile or digital technology-to address mobile female sex workers' unique needs while traveling. Future quantitative and qualitative research is needed to understand the context of female sex workers' mobility and how and why mobility influences risk environments and experiences of gender-based violence."
https://openalex.org/W3165600341,"Abstract Expression of exon-specific isoforms from alternatively spliced mRNA is a fundamental mechanism that substantially expands the proteome of a cell. However, conventional methods to assess alternative splicing are either consumptive and work-intensive or do not quantify isoform expression longitudinally at the protein level. Here, we therefore developed an exon-specific isoform expression reporter system (EXSISERS), which non-invasively reports the translation of exon-containing isoforms of endogenous genes by scarlessly excising reporter proteins from the nascent polypeptide chain through highly efficient, intein-mediated protein splicing. We applied EXSISERS to quantify the inclusion of the disease-associated exon 10 in microtubule-associated protein tau ( MAPT ) in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and screened Cas13-based RNA-targeting effectors for isoform specificity. We also coupled cell survival to the inclusion of exon 18b of FOXP1 , which is involved in maintaining pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, and confirmed that MBNL1 is a dominant factor for exon 18b exclusion. EXSISERS enables non-disruptive and multimodal monitoring of exon-specific isoform expression with high sensitivity and cellular resolution, and empowers high-throughput screening of exon-specific therapeutic interventions."

We found that the new CoV-specific multiplex assay was highly sensitive allowing plasma samples to be diluted 1:30,000 with a robust signal. The reactivity of IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and IgM responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein could distinguish COVID-19 samples from non-COVID-19 and pre-pandemic samples. The data from the three sample groups also revealed a unique pattern of cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and seasonal coronaviruses HKU1 and OC43. Our findings show that the CoV-2 IgM response is highly specific while the CoV-2 IgG response is more cross-reactive across a range of human CoVs and also showed that IgM and IgG responses show distinct patterns of epitope specificity. In summary, this multiplex assay was able to distinguish samples by COVID-19 status and characterize distinct trends in terms of cross-reactivity and fine-specificity in antibody responses, underscoring its potential value in diagnostic or serosurveillance efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3164092222,"The effects of stress on the neuroendocrine, central nervous and immune systems are extremely complex. The kynurenine pathway (KP) of the tryptophan metabolism is recognised as a cross-link between the neuroendocrine- and immune systems. However, the effects of acute stress from everyday life on KP activation have not yet been studied. This study aims to investigate changes in the levels of the KP neuroactive metabolites and cytokines in response to stress triggered by academic examinations. Ninety-two healthy first year medical students benevolently participated in the study. Parameters were measured pre- examination, which is considered to be a high-stress period, and post-examination, as a low-stress period. Stress induced by academic examinations significantly increases the perceived stress scores (p<0.001), serum cortisol levels (p<0.001) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels (p<0.01). It decreased IL-10 levels (p<0.05) but had no effect on IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels. Only the KP neuroactive metabolite, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) significantly increased (p<0.01) in the post-examination period. In addition, the stress scores positively correlated with the levels of cortisol (r2 = 0.297, p<0.01) at post examination. Acute stress triggered by academic examinations increases cortisol and BDNF production and suppresses the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, but did not increase significantly the levels of other pro-inflammatory cytokines, tryptophan, kynurenine and downstream KP metabolites. The concomitant increased levels of BDNF under the duress of acute examination stress appear to limit the levels pro-inflammatory markers, which may attenuate the action of cortisol and the neuroinflammatory branch of the KP."
https://openalex.org/W3165519449,"While chemotherapy is the most effective therapeutic approach for treating a variety of cancer patients, commonly used chemotherapeutic agents, often induce several adverse effects. Escalating evidence indicates that chemotherapeutics, particularly doxorubicin (DOX) and cyclophosphamide (CPS), induce cognitive impairment associated with central nervous system toxicity. This study was performed to determine neuroprotective effects of Oroxylum indicum extract (OIE) in regard to preventing chemotherapy induced cognitive impairment (CICI) occurring after 4 cycles of DOX (2mg/kg) and CPS (50mg/kg) combination chemotherapy in male C57BL/6J mice. OIE significantly prevented the chemotherapy impaired short-term cognitive performance, exploratory behavior associated with cognitive performance, cognitive performance, and spatial learning and memory in the Y-maze, Open-Field, Novel Object Recognition, and Morris Water Maze tests, respectively. These data suggest that OIE protects from the CICI. OIE decreased the reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxide generated by the chemotherapy treatment in the brain, while also blocking the chemotherapy-induced glutathione depletion. These results establish that OIE exhibits potent antioxidant activity in chemotherapy treated mice. Notably, OIE significantly increased the Complex-I and Complex-IV activities in the brain, indicating that OIE enhances mitochondrial function in the brain. In silico analysis of the major active chemical constituents (Oroxylin A, Baicalein and Chrysin) of OIE indicated that OIE has a favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profile. Taken together, our results are consistent with the conclusion that OIE prevents CICI by counteracting oxidative stress and perhaps by improving mitochondrial function."
https://openalex.org/W3164923988,"The presentational flow chart ""unwell adult"" of the Manchester Triage System (MTS) occupies a special role in this triage system, defined as the nonspecific presentation of an emergency patient. Current scientific studies show that a considerable proportion of emergency room patients present with so-called ""nonspecific complaints"". The aim of the present study is to investigate in detail the initial assessment of emergency patients triaged according to the presentational flow chart ""unwell adult"".Monocentric, retrospective observational study.Data on 14,636 emergency department visits between March 12th and August 12th, 2019 were included. During the observation period, the presentational flow chart ""unwell adult"" was used 1,143 times and it was the third most frequently used presentational flow chart. Patients triaged with this flow chart often had unspecific complaints upon admission to the emergency department. Patients triaged with the ""unwell adult"" chart were often classified with a lower triage level. Notably, patients who died in hospital during the observation period frequently received low triage levels. The AUC for the MTS flow chart ""unwell adult"" and hospitalization in general for older patients (age ≥ 65 years) was 0.639 (95% CI 0.578-0.701), and 0.730 (95% CI 0.714-0.746) in patients triaged with more specific charts. The AUC for the MTS flow chart ""unwell adult"" and admission to ICU for older patients (age ≥65 years) was 0.631 (95% CI 0.547-0.715) and 0.807 (95% CI 0.790-0.824) for patients triaged with more specific flow charts. Comparison of the predictive ability of the MTS for in-hospital mortality in the group triaged with the presentational flow chart ""unwell adult"" revealed an AUC of 0.682 (95% CI 0.595-0.769) vs. 0.834 (95% CI 0.799-0.869) in the other presentational flow charts.The presentational flow chart ""unwell adult"" is frequently used by triage nurses for initial assessment of patients. Patient characteristics assessed with the presentational flow chart ""unwell adult"" differ significantly from those assessed with MTS presentational flow charts for more specific symptoms. The quality of the initial assessment in terms of a well-functioning triage priority assessment tool is less accurate than the performance of the MTS described in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W3165153258,"Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating insult with few effective treatments. Edema and raised intracranial pressure contribute to poor outcome after ICH. Glibenclamide blocks the sulfonylurea 1 transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (Sur1-Trpm4) channel implicated in edema formation. While glibenclamide has been found to improve outcome and reduce mortality in animal models of severe ischemic stroke, in ICH the effects are less clear. In our previous study, we found no benefit after a moderate-sized bleed, while others have reported benefit. Here we tested the hypothesis that glibenclamide may only be effective in severe ICH, where edema is an important contributor to outcome. Glibenclamide (10 μg/kg loading dose, 200 ng/h continuous infusion) was administered 2 hours post-ICH induced by collagenase injection into the striatum of adult rats. A survival period of 24 hours was maintained for experiments 1-3, and 72 hours for experiment 4. Glibenclamide did not affect hematoma volume (~81 μL) or other safety endpoints (e.g., glucose levels), suggesting the drug is safe. However, glibenclamide did not lessen striatal edema (~83% brain water content), ionic dyshomeostasis (Na+, K+), or functional impairment (e.g., neurological deficits (median = 10 out of 14), etc.) at 24 hours. It also did not affect edema at 72 h (~86% brain water content), or overall mortality rates (25% and 29.4% overall in vehicle vs. glibenclamide-treated severe strokes). Furthermore, glibenclamide appears to worsen cytotoxic edema in the peri-hematoma region (cell bodies were 46% larger at 24 h, p = 0.0017), but no effect on cell volume or density was noted elsewhere. Overall, these findings refute our hypothesis, as glibenclamide produced no favorable effects following severe ICH."
https://openalex.org/W3164209969,"The aims of this study were to examine the prevalence of hospital contact in the year prior to suicide in Victoria, Australia, and to compare characteristics among those who did and did not have contact in the year prior to suicide.The study was a data linkage cohort study of 4348 Victorians who died by suicide over the period 2011-2017. Data from the Victorian Suicide Register (VSR) was linked with hospital separations and Emergency Department (ED) presentations datasets by the Centre for Victorian Data Linkages (CVDL). The main outcomes were: (1) hospital contact for any reason, (2) hospital contact for mental-health-related reasons, and (3) hospital contact for intentional self-harm. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were calculated as the measures of association.In the year prior to suicide, half of the decedents (50.0%) had hospital contact for any reason (n = 2172), 28.6% had mental-health-related hospital contact (n = 1244) and 9.9% had hospital contact for intentional self-harm (n = 432). In the year prior to suicide, when compared with males aged 25-49 years (the reference group):males aged 75+ years and females of all ages were significantly more likely to have hospital contact for any reasonfemales aged 10-24 years and 25-49 years were significantly more likely to have mental-health-related hospital contactfemales aged 10-24 years and 25-49 years had 3.5 times and 2.4 times the odds of having hospital contact for intentional self-harm.The comparatively high proportion of female decedents with mental-health related hospital contact in the year prior to suicide suggests improving the quality of care for those seeking help is an essential prevention initiative; this could be explored through programs such as the assertive outreach trials currently being implemented in Victoria and elsewhere in Australia. However, the sizeable proportion of males who do not have contact in the year prior to suicide was a consistent finding and represents a challenge for suicide prevention. Programs to identify males at risk in the community and engage them in the health care system are essential. In addition, promising universal and selective interventions to reduce suicide in the cohort who do not have hospital contact, include restricting access to lethal means and other public health interventions are also needed."

A photograph-based Q method was adopted. Results confirmed the visual quality of a photograph was the most important characteristic that determined its perceived attractiveness; those photographs with a high visual quality could successfully attract tourists' attention. The subject also significantly affected the preferences of observers, suggesting an interest-dependent pattern. Using photographs of birds as examples, the participants who were interested in birds were attracted by the photographs of birds rather than those of other subjects. This study provides a better understanding of the effectiveness of photographs for communication. Findings may help researchers, communicators and national park marketers better understand and select appropriate photographs for interpretation within national parks."
https://openalex.org/W3165528795,"Collagen cross-links contribute to the mechanical resilience of the intervertebral disc (IVD). UVA-light-activated riboflavin-induced collagen crosslinking (UVA-CXL) is a well-established and effective ophthalmological intervention that increases the mechanical rigidity of the collagen-rich corneal matrix in Keratoconus. This study explores the feasibility, safety and efficacy of translating this intervention in reinforcing the IVD.Annulus fibrosus (AF) cells were isolated from bovine IVDs and treated with different combinations of riboflavin (RF) concentrations (0.05-8 mM) and UVA light intensities (0.3-4 mW/cm2). Metabolic activity (resazurin assay), cell viability (TUNEL assay), and gene expression of apoptosis regulators C-FOS and PT5 were assessed immediately and 24 hours after treatment. Biomechanical effects of UVA-CXL on IVDs were measured by indentation analysis of changes in the instantaneous modulus and by peel-force delamination strength analysis of the AF prior and after treatment.Different intensities of UVA did not impair the metabolic activity of AF cells. However, RF affected metabolic activity (p < 0.001). PT53 expression was similar in all RF conditions tested while C-FOS expression decreased 24 hours after treatment. Twenty-four hours after treatment, no apoptotic cells were observed in any condition tested. Biomechanical characterizations showed a significant increase in the annular peel strength of the UVA-CXL group, when compared to controls of UVA and RF alone (p < 0.05). UVA-CXL treated IVDs showed up to 152% higher (p < 0.001) instantaneous modulus values compared to the untreated control.This is the first study on UVA-CXL treatment of IVD. It induced significantly increased delamination strength and instantaneous modulus indentation values in intact IVD samples in a structure-function relationship. RF concentrations and UVA intensities utilized in ophthalmological clinical protocols were well tolerated by the AF cells. Our findings suggest that UVA-CXL may be a promising tool to reinforce the IVD matrix."
https://openalex.org/W3165602183,"Nonlethal disturbance of animals can cause behavioral and physiological changes that affect individual health status and vital rates, with potential consequences at the population level. Predicting these population effects remains a major challenge in ecology and conservation. Monitoring fitness-related traits may improve detection of upcoming population changes, but the extent to which individual traits are reliable indicators of disturbance exposure is not well understood, especially for populations regulated by density dependence. Here we study how density dependence affects a population's response to disturbance and modifies the disturbance effects on individual health and vital rates. We extend an energy budget model for a medium-sized cetacean (the long-finned pilot whale Globicephala melas) to an individual-based population model in which whales feed on a self-replenishing prey base and disturbance leads to cessation of feeding. In this coupled predator-prey system, the whale population is regulated through prey depletion and the onset of yearly repeating disturbances on the whale population at carrying capacity decreased population density and increased prey availability due to reduced top-down control. In populations faced with multiple days of continuous disturbance each year, female whales that were lactating their first calf experienced increased mortality due to depletion of energy stores. However, increased prey availability led to compensatory effects and resulted in a subsequent improvement of mean female body condition, mean age at first reproduction and higher age-specific reproductive output. These results indicate that prey-mediated density dependence can mask negative effects of disturbance on fitness-related traits and vital rates, a result with implications for the monitoring and management of marine mammal populations."
https://openalex.org/W3165018244,"Freeze-thaw cycles in soil are driven by water migration, phase transitions, and heat transfer, which themselves are closely coupled variables in the natural environment. To simulate this complex periglacial process at different time and length scales, a multi-physics model was established by solving sets of equations describing fluid flow and heat transfer, and a dynamic equilibrium equation for phase changes in moisture. This model considers the effects of water-ice phase changes on the hydraulic and thermal properties of soil and the effect of latent heat during phase transition. These equations were then discretized by using the finite volume method and solved using iteration. The open-source software OpenFOAM was used to generate computational code for simulation of coupled heat and fluid transport during freezing and thawing of soil. A set of laboratory freezing tests considering two thermal boundary conditions were carried out, of which the results were obtained to verify the proposed model. In general, the numerical solutions agree well with the measured data. A railway embankment problem, incorporating soil hydrothermal behavior in response to seasonal variations in surface temperature, was finally solved with the finite volume-based approach, indicating the algorithm's robustness and flexibility."

The parameters collected were systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, urine output, uterine involution, and bleeding. Out-of-range values of any of these parameters triggered a warning, and an obstetrician was called to examine the patient. The obstetrician then decided whether to call the anesthesiologist. We carried out a sensitivity-specificity study of triggers and a multivariate analysis of the factors involved in developing potentially fatal disorders (PFD), reintervention, critical care admission, and stay.The MEWS was triggered in 75 patients (6.43%). Leading trigger was altered systolic blood pressure in 32 patients (42.7%), and 11 patients had a PFD. Twenty-eight triggers were false-negatives. Sensitivity and specificity of the system was 0.28 (0.15, 0.45) and 0.94 (0.93, 0.96), respectively. The multivariate analysis showed a correlation between trigger activation and PFD.Our MEWS presented low sensitivity and high specificity, with a significant number of false-negatives."
https://openalex.org/W3164959939,"Mauritius introduced Acute respiratory infection (ARI) syndromic surveillance in 2007. The Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) and the World Health Organization Average Curve Method (WHO ACM) have been used widely in several countries to establish thresholds to determine the seasonality of acute respiratory infections. This study aimed to evaluate the appropriateness of these tools for ARI syndromic surveillance in Mauritius, where two or more waves are observed.The proportion of attendance due to acute respiratory infections was identified as the transmissibility indicator to describe seasonality using the Moving Epidemic Method and the WHO Average Curve Method. The proportion was obtained from weekly outpatient data between 2012 and 2018 collected from the sentinel acute respiratory infections surveillance. A cross-validation analysis was carried out. The resulting indicators of the goodness of fit model were used to assess the robustness of the seasonal/epidemic threshold of both the Moving Epidemic Method and WHO Average Curve Method. Additionally, a comparative analysis examined the integrity of the thresholds without the year 2017.The cross-validation analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences between the means scores of the indicators when comparing the two waves/seasons curves of WHO ACM and MEM. The only exception being that the Wilcoxon sign rank test strongly supported that the specificity mean score of the two waves/seasons curve for WHO ACM outweighed that of its corresponding wave model for the MEM (P = 0.002). The comparative analysis with 2017 data showed the value of the epidemic threshold remained the same regardless of the methods and the number of seasonal waves.The two waves models of the Moving Epidemic Method and WHO Average Curve Method could be deployed for acute respiratory infection syndromic surveillance in Mauritius, considering that two or more activity peaks are observed in a season."
https://openalex.org/W3164373157,"This study examined how different forms of childhood family victimization are associated with the attitudinal (not actual action) refusal of wife abuse among women and men in rural Bangladesh. It included 1,929 randomly selected married women and men. Of the sample, 31.3% (Men = 49.3%, Women = 13.5%) attitudinally refused overall wife abuse, 38.5% (Men = 53.2%, Women = 23.8%) refused emotional abuse, 67.0% (Men = 82.5%, Women = 51.6%) refused physical abuse, 78.0% (Men = 88.6%, Women = 67.4%) refused abuse on wife's disobeying family obligations, and 32.3% (Men = 50.3%, Women = 14.6%) refused abuse on challenging male authority. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the odds ratio (ORs) of the attitudinal refusal of overall wife abuse were 1.75 (p = .041) for the childhood non-victims of emotional abuse and 2.31 (p < .001) for the victims of mild emotional abuse, compared to the victims of severe emotional abuse. On the other hand, the ORs of the overall refusal of abuse were 1.84 (p = .031) for the non-victims of physical abuse and 1.29 (p = .465) for the victims of mild physical abuse, compared to the childhood victims of severe physical abuse. Data further revealed that the childhood non-victimization of physical abuse increased all types of attitudinal refusal of wife abuse, e.g., emotional abuse, physical abuse, abuse on disobeying family obligations, and abuse on challenging male authority. Compared to the childhood experiences of severe emotional abuse, data also indicated that childhood exposure to mild emotional abuse might increase the attitudinal refusal of wife abuse on a few issues, e.g., abuse on disobeying family obligations, abuse on challenging male authority, and physical abuse. It appeared that childhood experiences of family victimization greatly influence different types of attitudinal refusal of wife abuse. We argue that the issue of childhood victimization should be brought to the forefront in the discourse. We recommend that state machinery and social welfare agencies should expend significant efforts to stop child abuse within the family and in other areas of society in rural Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W3165708031,"The third time I took the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) was going to be my last, regardless of how I scored. I had long harbored dreams of pursuing a Ph.D., and I wanted to do well because the exam is key for admission to many U.S. graduate programs. But I couldn't afford to retake it, emotionally or financially. I was unemployed at the time and my partner and I were trying to get by on his postdoc salary. I'd taken the exam 7 years earlier, but my scores were so low I didn't even bother applying to Ph.D. programs. Now, I was giving it one more shot.



> “I wonder what I'd be doing if the admissions committee had not overlooked my GRE scores.” 

I didn't know what standardized tests were until high school, when I immigrated from Colombia to the United States. I wanted to attend college so I took the American College Testing exam. Fortunately, my high school offered a free prep course and I managed to achieve good enough scores to get into college with financial aid.

During my first year, I told my biology professor I was passionate about studying and protecting nature. He offered me a position in his lab, which taught me how to conduct research and what a career in academia looks like. Then, in my third year I was selected for a program that prepares undergraduate students from underrepresented groups for doctoral studies. As I neared graduation, applying to grad school felt like a natural next step.

But then I took the GRE and bombed, testing below average in all sections. I couldn't afford to enroll in a prep course, which cost upward of $3000. Instead, I had studied using a $40 test prep book. As a native Spanish speaker, I found the verbal section demoralizing. But what was even more daunting was the way the test was administered: Correct answers were followed by harder questions. That affected me psychologically: When easier questions appeared, I assumed I'd gotten the previous question wrong.

Convinced I would perform better and manage my test anxiety with more preparation, I took time off after graduation to study full time. But my scores didn't improve on my second try. My hopes of becoming a scientist vanished.

Over the next few years, I took a series of temporary jobs. I worked in a molecular biology lab troubleshooting protocols. Then I moved to Brazil—a place I'd always wanted to live—and found jobs studying birds in the Amazon rainforest and curating specimens in a natural history museum. That connected me with professors in Brazil, where I was accepted into a master's program.

After I defended my master's thesis, a paper on which I was the lead author—my first—was accepted for publication. Slowly, I began to see myself as a scientist. I wanted to continue down the academic path. So after my partner and I moved to Boston for his postdoc, I summoned the courage to give the GRE one last try. I studied for weeks and paid $205 to book an appointment.

I remember how anxious I was as I walked into the windowless, dimly lit exam center, aware my performance that day could make or break my dream of pursuing a Ph.D. As the test proceeded, I thought it was going OK. But when my score appeared on screen immediately afterward, my stomach dropped. I'd scored even lower than my first two attempts. I felt defeated.

Afterward, I reached out to a professor who I'd been in contact with before my exam appointment. I felt insecure and embarrassed about my scores, but our conversation left me reassured. He told me about research suggesting the GRE is a better measure of race, ethnicity, and income than academic ability, and he ended by saying, “I will go to battle for you in front of the admissions committee.” His confidence in my potential encouraged me to continue applying.

Weeks later, when I received an offer from his university, I felt a mixture of excitement and disbelief. I was filled with joy, but I also couldn't believe how much time, energy, and expense it had taken to get into a Ph.D. program.

Now in my third year, I have no doubt I am where I need to be. Still, I wonder what I'd be doing if the admissions committee had not overlooked my GRE scores. It pains me to think how many people are kept out of science not for a lack of talent, but because they didn't excel at a standardized test. Many graduate programs, including my own, have decided to drop the GRE requirement in recent years—and I hope many others will follow."
