https://openalex.org/W1624356339,"Centrifuge transport, equilibrium dialysis, and electron paramagnetic resonance studies on the binding of Mn2+ to myosin revealed two sets of noninteracting binding sites which are characterized at low ionic strength (0.016 M KCl) by affinity constants of 10(6) M-1 (Class I) and 10(3) M-1 (Class II), respectively. At 0.6 M KCl concentration, the affinity of Mn2+ for both sets of sites is reduced. The maximum number of binding sites is 2 for the high affinity and 20 to 25 for the low affinity set. Other divalent metal ions displace Mn2+ from the high affinity sites in the following order of effectiveness: Ca greater than Mg = Zn = Co greater than Sr greater than Ni. The inhibitory effects of Mg2+ and Ca2+ upon the Mn2+ binding are competitive with inhibitor constants of 0.75 to 1 mM which is similar to that of the low affinity divalent metal ion binding sites. Exposure of myosin to 37 degrees partially inhibits Mn2+ binding to Class I parallel with inhibition of ATPase activity. The binding of Mn2+ to the high affinity binding sites is not significantly influenced by ADP or PPi, although Mn2+ increases the affinity of ADP binding to myosin at high ionic strength."

https://openalex.org/W2023608301,"The extrapolation of the ""distributive-pairing hypothesis"" of meiosis in Drosophila melanogaster females to human gametogenesis is proposed to account for the co-occurrence of rare karyotype abnormalities in human families. A description of the hypothesis is presented with its application to some established cases in the cytogenetic literature."

https://openalex.org/W1519595840,"Abstract : An enzymic methylation of iodophenols has been described. The enzyme occurs in the soluble fraction of rat liver from which it has been partially purified. The enzyme utilizes S-adenosylmethionine as methyl donor. In contrast to catechol O-methyltransferase, iodophenol Omethyltransferase requires no divalent cation for activity. Among the substrates tested, 3,5diiodo-4-hydroxybenzoic acid was most rapidly methylated. Tetraiodothyroacetic acid was methlated at an appreciable rate, but triiodothyroacetic acid, thyroxine, and triiodothyronine were not significantly methylated under the conditions tried. Iodophenol O-methyltransferase was distinguished from catechol O-methyltransferase by its greater stability to heat and its lack of a requirement for divalent cations. The two enzymes were also differentiated by separations on calcium phosphate gel and on a diethylaminoethyl cellulose column and by varying distributions among the tissues of different animals.

Previous descriptions of the dendritic terminations have been restricted to light-microscopical investigations on material stained vitally with methylene blue. The findings of earlier workers on this subject have been reviewed by Snodgrass1, who concluded that the dendrites terminate on the basement membrane covering the epidermal cells. Accounts of more recent work on the sub-epidermal nerve plexus of insects2–5 also support this conclusion. However, electron-microscopic investigations made by the author on the sub-epidermal nerve plexus of the blowfly larva, Phormia terrae-novae, indicate that the dendrites do not terminate on the basement membrane, and the results of preliminary investigations are given here."

https://openalex.org/W2013443772,"RECENT investigations of the sensitivity of certain groups of fishes to minute local potential changes have revealed the fact that all members of these groups possess specialized neuromasts in addition to their ordinary lateral-line organs. Whereas the ordinary organs are used as ‘distant touch’ receptors, responding to mechanical stimuli, several facts and considerations have led to the assumption that the specialized or ‘ampullary’ organs are used as electroreceptors1. The ampullæ of Lorenzini, which occur on the head of all elasmobranchs, are typical and important representatives of this latter group of derived lateral sense organs. Electrophysiologically, the ampullæ have been shown to respond to slight potential changes (1 µV/cm)2. On the other hand, behaviour experiments revealed the occurrence of muscular reactions in rays and dogfishes in response to equally minute or even weaker electrical stimuli (0.1 µV/cm)3."

https://openalex.org/W2025150795,"IN entomology the real compound eye (excluding the agglomerated eye) is considered to be provided with the hexagonal facet either in its outer or inner layer of the cornea. It is well known that the size of the facet is uniform, in most of the compound eye of insects with some exceptional cases, such as the eyes of a certain Tabanid-fly and dragon-fly, and moth of Psilogramma increta. The first type of the eye is formed by two divided parts with large and mall facets, the second type of the eye has facets the size of which increases from ventrally to dorsally, and the third type of the eye has small facets at the peripheral part and has larger facets the size of which increases toward the centre of the eye. I have found that the compound eye of a butterfly of Leptidea (Pieridae) has two kinds of deformed hexagonal facet which differ in the size intermingling together with an irregular arrangement in the whole surface of the eye as shown in Fig. 1."
