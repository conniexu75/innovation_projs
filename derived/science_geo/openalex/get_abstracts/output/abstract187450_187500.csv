https://openalex.org/W2161997291,"Lactoperoxidase (LPO) is an enzyme with antimicrobial properties present in saliva, milk, tears, and airway secretions. Although the formation of microbicidal oxidants by LPO has been recognized for some time, the source of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for LPO-catalyzed reactions remains unknown. Reactive oxygen species produced by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (phox) play a critical role in host defense against pathogens; however, analogous oxidant-generating systems in other tissues have not been associated with antimicrobial activity. Several homologues of gp91phox, the catalytic core of this enzyme, were described recently; dual oxidase (Duox)1/thyroid oxidase 1 and Duox2/thyroid oxidase 2 were identified in the thyroid gland and characterized as H2O2 donors for thyroxin biosynthesis. We examined Duox1 and Duox2 expression in secretory glands and on mucosal surfaces and give evidence for their presence and activity in salivary glands, rectum, trachea, and bronchium. Epithelial cells in salivary excretory ducts and rectal glands express Duox2, whereas tracheal and bronchial epithelial cells express Duox1. Furthermore, we detected Duox1-dependent H2O2 release by cultured human bronchial epithelial cells. Our observations suggest that Duox1 and Duox2 are novel H2O2 sources that can support LPO-mediated antimicrobial defense mechanisms on mucosal surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2106293055,"Over the past decade cyclooxygenase-2-derived prostaglandins have been implicated in the development and progression of many types of cancer. Recently our laboratory has shown that treatment with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induces increased proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of colorectal carcinoma cells (Sheng, H., Shao, J., Washington, M. K., and DuBois, R. N. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 18075–18081). The stimulatory effects of PGE2 were dependent upon the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. However, the exact signaling cascade responsible for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt activation by PGE2 remains poorly defined. In the present study, we demonstrate that the PGE2-induced migration and invasion occurs via rapid transactivation and phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Within minutes following treatment, PGE2 induces the activation of Akt. This effect was completely abolished by EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors providing evidence for the role of the EGFR in this response. The rapid transactivation of the EGFR occurs via an intracellular Src-mediated event but not through the release of an extracellular epidermal growth factor-like ligand. EGFR transactivation was also observed in vivo by the direct comparison of normal and malignant human colorectal samples. These results suggest that in developing colonic carcinomas, the early effects of cyclooxygenase-2-derived PGE2 are in part mediated by the EGFR, and this transactivation is responsible for subsequent down-stream effects including the stimulation of cell migration and invasion. Over the past decade cyclooxygenase-2-derived prostaglandins have been implicated in the development and progression of many types of cancer. Recently our laboratory has shown that treatment with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) induces increased proliferation, migration, and invasiveness of colorectal carcinoma cells (Sheng, H., Shao, J., Washington, M.

Over the last few years, a heightened interest in the role of COX-2 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclooxygenase; NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; PG, prostaglandin; EP, E prostanoid; PI, phosphatidylinositol; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; AR, amphiregulin; TGF-α, transforming growth factor-α; GPCRs, G-protein-coupled receptors; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase. in neoplasia has emerged. This interest originally arose from epidemiological studies showing up to a 50% reduction in the mortality rate from certain cancers in patients consuming nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as aspirin (1Greenberg E.R.

Because of these initial findings, the use of NSAIDS and COX-2 selective inhibitors has been shown to inhibit growth and metastasis in many cell cultures and animal models of a variety of malignancies (4Gupta R.A.

When COX-2 knockout mice are crossed with mice that are heterozygous for an APCΔ716 mutation, the resulting progeny had a substantial reduction of intestinal tumors (13Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E.

Furthermore, overexpression of COX-2 in breast tissue in transgenic mice leads to the development of breast carcinomas, indicating that it plays a key role in tumor promotion in certain contexts (14Liu C.H. Chang S.H. Narko K. Trifan O.C. Wu M.T. Smith E. Haudenschild C. Lane T.F. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18563-18569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). However, the definitive mechanism(s) through which COX-2 mediates these effects remains unknown. Cyclooxygenase (or prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase) catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2. This unstable endoperoxide is then converted into PGE2, PGI2, PGD2, PGF2, or thromboxane A2 by each respective PG synthase. Most tumors that express cyclooxygenase have been found to contain high levels of PGE2 and the microsomal PGE synthase enzyme. Presumably, these bioactive lipid products of cyclooxygenase, such as PGE2, are responsible for some of the pro-neoplastic effects mediated by this enzyme. Currently, there are two known isoforms of cyclooxygenase, which are referred to as COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is expressed constitutively in many tissues; however, recent evidence (15Diaz A. Chepenik K.P. Korn J.H. Reginato A.M. Jimenez S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 16Gupta R.A. Tejada L.V. Tong B.J. Das S.K. Morrow J.D. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that the expression of COX-1 is induced in some tumors, such as ovarian cancer. Conversely, COX-2 is not expressed constitutively in many situations, although it can be found in the normal brain, kidney, and reproductive tract. COX-2 expression is induced by many growth factors, cytokines, and tumor promoters (17Williams C.S. DuBois R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G393-G400PubMed Google Scholar), and elevated expression of COX-2 has been observed in many malignancies including the breast, lung, and colon. The prostaglandin products of COX-1 and COX-2 have been shown to exert many biological properties such as the induction of inflammation, the maintenance of kidney function, and the modulation of the immune response (18DuBois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L. Gupta R.A. Simon L.S. Van De Putte L.B. Lipsky P.E. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has shown recently that COX-derived PGE2 can induce the growth, migration, and invasiveness of colorectal carcinoma cells (19Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). PGE2 also induced a change in morphology of these cells by stimulating the reorganization of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes. In these studies, PGE2-induced the activation of PI 3-kinase and its immediate downstream effector Akt (or protein kinase B). We found that inhibition of PI 3-kinase with wortmannin or LY 294002 blocked the activation of Akt. These inhibitors also blocked the morphologic, proliferative, and metastatic changes induced by PGE2. From our previous study we found that PGE2 initially binds to its cognate receptor, EP4 in LS-174T cells, which in turn activates signals that lead to dramatic changes in cell biology. Based on these initial studies, we investigated the pathway through which PGE2 activates the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway. We found that the PGE2-induced activation of Akt and the subsequent increase in migration and invasion occur through a Src/EGFR-mediated event. Materials—Antibodies to Akt and phospho-Akt were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to EGFR, COX-2, and β-actin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to phospho-Tyr and EGFR (neutralizing ab) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies to EGF, AR, TGF-α, HB-EGF, betacellulin, and human recombinant TGF-α were obtained from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). PGE2 was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), and GM6001 was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Genistein, PD 153035, AG 1478, PP2, SQ 22536, and U-73122 were purchased from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—LS174T cells were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). These cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, washed in PBS, and incubated with serum-free media for 48 h prior to agonist treatment. Whole Cell Lysate Preparation—Quiescent cells were treated with inhibitors and/or agonists at 37 °C for various times as indicated in the experiments. The cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS and scraped in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). The cells were disrupted by brief sonication, and protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein determination reagent. Immunoprecipitation of the EGFR—Quiescent cells were treated with inhibitors and/or agonists at 37 °C for various times as indicated in the experiments. The cells were rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS and scraped in 500 μl of IP buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were disrupted by brief sonication and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated overnight with gentle rocking at 4 °C with EGFR antibody conjugated to protein A-agarose beads. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 3 times with IP buffer. Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) containing either 5% dry milk or BSA. Primary antibody incubations were performed in TTBS with either 5% dry milk or BSA overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h in TTBS with either 5% dry milk or BSA. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system from Amersham Biosciences. Cell Migration and Invasion Assays—Cell migration and invasion assays were performed essentially as previously described (19Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 104 cells were suspended in 400 μl of serum free McCoys's 5A media and placed in the collagen-coated (migration) or 1:10 diluted Matrigel-coated (invasion) upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with serum-free McCoy's 5A media containing 1 μm PGE2. After overnight incubation, the cells were fixed in Diff Quick Fixative from DADE Diagnostics (Deerfield, IL) and stained in 0.1% crystal violet. Cells were removed from the upper surface of the filter with a cotton swab. Cells were counted on the undersurface of the filter to determine migration. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Real Time Quantitative PCR—Gene expression was quantified using real time quantitative PCR or TaqMan technique as described previously (20Mann M. Sheng H. Shao J. Williams C.S. Pisacane P.I.

Human cDNA FLJ22101 fis (GenBank™ accession number AK025754) 2A. Tucker, personal communication. was used as a housekeeping gene for normalization of EGFR family receptor and ligand gene expression. Primer/probe sets for FLJ22101 are as follows: F 59-CTTTTGCCTCTGGCAGTACTCA-39, R 59-TTCCCTGTGGCACTTGACATT-39, and P 59-FAM-TGTCTTAAAGTTTTTGAAGTACATCTTCTGGCCCC-TAMRAp-39. Taqman Universal Master Mix was used for all reactions and was obtained from PE Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). TaqMan analysis was performed in a standard 96-well plate format. Standard curves were constructed using 0.016–10 ng of total mRNA prepared from cultured T-47D breast carcinoma cells for all genes, including the normalization gene, and 0.4 ng was used for each unknown reaction. Each standard curve and unknown dilution were run in triplicate. Human Colorectal Tissue Samples—Human colorectal carcinoma specimens were obtained from surgical resections with Internal Review Board approval. For each carcinoma sample, adjacent normal mucosa was collected for comparison. All samples were immediately frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Tissues were dissolved in IP buffer and centrifuged to remove insoluble material. Whole cell lysate and immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. Activation of Akt by Prostaglandin E2—Previously our laboratory has shown (19Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar) that the treatment of colorectal carcinoma cells with PGE2 induced the activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. However, the earliest time point measured in our original publication was at 2 h following treatment. In order to analyze the earliest PGE2-induced signaling events affected, we examined the ability of PGE2 to activate Akt in a short time course as determined by the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473. The phosphorylation of Akt on Ser-473 is required for its activation (21Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar) and commonly used as a marker for increased signaling via this pathway. As shown in Fig. 1A, PGE2 induced the phosphorylation/activation of Akt as early as 1 min after stimulation. The activation of Akt was maximal within 10 min and was sustained through 60 min of treatment. Furthermore, the addition of PGE2 activated Akt in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The activation of Akt was maximal at 1 μm PGE2 so this concentration of PGE2 was used in all subsequent experiments. Activation of Akt by PGE2 Requires the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor—Recently there has been a concerted effort to understand the signaling cascades from G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to events typically thought to be associated with growth factor stimulation, such as the PI 3-kinase/Akt and Ras/Raf/MEK pathways (22Carpenter, G. (2000) Science's STKE http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/E1.Google Scholar, 23Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Because many of the early signaling events mediated by growth factors require tyrosine phosphorylation, we first determined the effect of a general tyrosine kinase inhibitor (genistein) on PGE2-induced activation of Akt. As shown in Fig. 2A, preincubation of LS-174T cells with 10 μm genistein caused a complete inhibition of the PGE2-induced activation of Akt. This indicates an essential role for a tyrosine kinase in this pathway connecting the GPCR (EP4) to PI 3-kinase. Over the last few years an increasing amount of evidence suggests that GPCRs can transactivate the EGFR (24Vacca F. Bagnato A. Catt K.J. Tecce R. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5310-5317PubMed Google Scholar, 25Gschwind A. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6329-6336PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether a functional EGFR was required for the PGE2-induced activation of Akt, we pretreated colonic carcinoma cells with two EGFR kinase-selective inhibitors (PD 153035 and AG 1478). Pretreatment with 1 μm PD 153035 greatly inhibited the activation of Akt by PGE2 (Fig. 2B), although pretreatment with 5 μm AG 1478 completely inhibited the activation of Akt. These results strongly indicate that the PGE2-induced activation of Akt is mediated via the activation of EGFR. Because the use of EGFR-specific inhibitors blocked the activation of Akt, we next examined whether PGE2 could activate the EGFR directly. Activation of the EGFR was determined by the immunoprecipitation of the EGFR followed by Western analysis with phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies. The treatment of LS-174T cells with 1 μm PGE2-induced a rapid phosphorylation of the EGFR (Fig. 2C). This phosphorylation was detected within 2.5 min and was sustained through 10 min. Role of Src in the PGE2-induced Transactivation of the EGFR—The activation of Src has been reported to play a role in the GPCR-mediated transactivation of the EGFR (26Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 27Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined if the activation of Src is required for the PGE2-induced activation of Akt. As shown in Fig. 3A, pretreatment with the Src-specific inhibitor PP2 completely blocked the activation of Akt by PGE2. Similar results were observed with another inhibitor of Src as well, PP1 (data not shown). Src has been shown to serve as a signaling mediator between GPCRs and the EGFR as well as a downstream effector of the EGFR. To determine whether the activation of Src in the PGE2-induced activation of Akt lies upstream or downstream of the EGFR, we examined the effect of PP2 on the PGE2-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR. Pretreatment of LS-174T cells with the Src inhibitor PP2 completely inhibited the PGE2-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR (Fig. 3B). As expected, pretreatment with the EGFR-specific inhibitor PD 153035 completely blocked the phosphorylation of the EGFR as well. To verify further the role of Src in the PGE2-induced activation of the EGFR and Akt, we next examined the ability of PGE2 to activate Src by measuring the phosphorylation of Src. As Fig. 3C shows, PGE2 stimulated the phosphorylation of Src in LS-174T cells. Also, pretreatment of the cells with the EGFR-specific inhibitor PD 153035 had little effect on the PGE2-induced phosphorylation of Src. These results indicate that PGE2 transactivates the EGFR through an Src-dependent manner and that Src is activated prior to the EGFR. PGE2 Transactivates the EGFR through an Intracellular Mechanism—Many possible GPCR signaling pathways have been reported that can transactivate the EGFR. These include the extracellular release of an EGF-like ligand, the activation of a β-arrestin/Src pathway, and the modulation of reactive oxide species that can affect the activity of EGFR-specific tyrosine phosphatases (28Pai R. Soreghan B. Szabo I.L. Pavelka M. Baatar D. Tarnawski A.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar, 29Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14468-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine the mechanism through which the EP receptor could transactivate the EGFR. The addition of neutralizing antibodies to EGF-like ligands in the media of cultured cells can inhibit the stimulation of the EGFR by blocking the ligand/receptor interaction. In order to determine which EGF-like ligand might serve a role in the transactivation of the EGFR, we first analyzed the mRNA content of these ligands in the LS-174T cells by real time quantitative PCR. As shown in Fig. 4A, LS-174T cells express high mRNA levels of betacellulin and epiregulin as well as small amounts of HB-EGF, TGF-α, EGF, and amphiregulin. No heregulin mRNA was found in these cells. This expression profile was similar to that of another colorectal carcinoma cell line, HCA-7 (20Mann M. Sheng H. Shao J. Williams C.S. Pisacane P.I. Sliwkowski M.X. DuBois R.N. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1713-1719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We also analyzed the mRNA expression profile for the EGFR as well as the other members of the ErbB (HER) family. We found that the LS-174T cells contain the highest mRNA level of the EGFR followed by the HER-3 and HER-2 receptors. We did not detect any mRNA for the HER-4 receptor. Furthermore, treatment of LS-174T cells with PGE2 for 6 h induced only a slight increase in the ErbB ligands epiregulin, betacellulin, and amphiregulin. Because LS-174T cells contain mRNA for all the known ErbB ligands except heregulin, we pretreated cells for 2 h in the presence of individual neutralizing antibodies for the remaining ErbB ligands. Cells were then incubated with 1 μm PGE2 for 10 min, and the phosphorylation of Akt was determined. As indicated in Fig. 4B, the pretreatment of cells with neutralizing antibodies to AR, TGF-α, HB-EGF, EGF, or betacellulin had no effect on the activation of Akt. The only neutralizing antibody that exhibited any inhibitory effects was the EGFR-neutralizing antibody. This was expected because these antibodies can prevent the dimerization of EGFRs and therefore block receptor activation. Furthermore, PGE2 has been shown to induce the extracellular release of TGF-α in other colorectal carcinoma cell lines (28Pai R. Soreghan B. Szabo I.L. Pavelka M. Baatar D. Tarnawski A.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Because we found no effect of TGF-α-neutralizing antibodies in LS-174T cells, we verified the neutralizing ability of the TGF-α antibodies in our system. As shown in Fig. 4C, the addition of TGF-α (1 or 10 μg/ml) induced the phosphorylation of Akt. However, incubation of TGF-α with neutralizing antibodies for 20 min prior to treatment inhibited the activation of Akt completely. Together, these results suggest that the transactivation of the EGFR does not occur to a major extent through the extracellular release of an EGF-like ligand in LS-174T cells. Although we found no evidence for an extracellular pathway, we could not rule out the possibility that signaling could occur through epiregulin or an unknown ErbB ligand. To explore this possibility further, we also determined what effect a general matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor might have on the PGE2-induced transactivation of the EGFR. The release of EGF and other ErbB ligands has been shown to require the activation of a MMP, like those of the ADAM family (32Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). As Fig. 4D shows, the pretreatment of LS-174T cells with a general MMP inhibitor, GM6001, had no effect on the PGE2-induced activation of Akt. This MMP inhibitor also had no effect on the PGE2-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR (data not shown). Role of EGFR Transactivation in the PGE2-induced Migration and Invasion of LS-174T Cells—As discussed previously, we have shown that PGE2 can induce the migration (uncoated) and invasion (Matrigel-coated) of LS-174T cells through transwell filters (19Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). To determine whether transactivation of the EGFR is required for the PGE2-induced migration and invasion of LS-174T cells, we incubated cells in the presence of various inhibitors, and we determined their effect on cell migration or invasion. As shown in Fig. 5, the EGFR inhibitors (PD 153035 and AG 1478) or Src inhibitors (PP2) can completely block PGE2-induced migration (Fig. 5A) and invasion (Fig. 5B) of LS-174T cells. However, inhibition of MMPs with GM6001 had no significant effect on migration but did inhibit cell invasion. Because the stimulation of GPCRs can induce the activation of PLC/PKC and cAMP/PKA pathways, we also evaluated the effect of inhibitors to phospholipase C (U-73122) and adenylate cyclase (SQ 22536). These inhibitors had no effect indicating that these pathways were not involved in PGE2-stimulated migration or invasion. We have also shown previously that PKA inhibitors did not block the PGE2-mediated activation of Akt. Evaluation of EGFR and COX-2 in Human Colorectal Tissues—Our laboratory was the first to report an increase in the expression of COX-2 in colorectal cancers (33Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. DuBois R.N. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1183-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because COX-2-derived prostaglandins play a role in the migration and invasion of colonic carcinoma cells, and this phenomenon requires the activation of the EGFR, we sought to determine whether there was a correlation between the expression of COX-2 and the EGFR in vivo. As Fig. 6A shows in 3 of 4 samples, we found an increase in the expression of COX-2 that correlated to an increase in the expression of the EGFR in human colorectal cancers. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of the EGFR and subsequent phosphotyrosine Western analysis indicated an increase in the activity of the EGFR in 3 of 4 tumor samples versus their adjacent normal mucosa (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, this increase in EGFR activity also correlated with an increase in the expression of COX-2. These results indicate that in vivo COX-2-derived prostaglandins may potentially transactivate the EGFR, and this interaction could affect the biology of carcinoma cells in vivo by increasing their metastatic potential. The GPCR-induced transactivation of growth factor receptors is evident in many systems including the β-adrenergic, lysophosphatidic acid (Edg), and endothelin receptors (26Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 34Maudsley S. Pierce K.L. Zamah A.M. Miller W.E. Ahn S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

Acta. 2002; 1582: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Because PGE2 can induce the activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway and in many circumstances the modulation of Akt signaling normally occurs via growth factor stimulation, we sought to determine whether the effects of PGE2 on LS174T cells were mediated through a growth factor receptor. Our findings are summarized in Fig. 7. Here we report that PGE2 induced the activation of Akt within minutes, and this activation occurred through the EGFR. We show that EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors completely block PGE2-induced activation of Akt. Furthermore, PGE2 itself can induce the phosphorylation and, therefore, activation of the EGFR. Recently, Pai et al. (28Pai R. Soreghan B. Szabo I.L. Pavelka M. Baatar D. Tarnawski A.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) reported a similar finding, consistent with our results, indicating that PGE2 can transactivate the EGFR. We extended our findings to reveal that PGE2 transactivates the EGFR via an intracellular Src-mediated pathway. The ability of GPCRs to transactivate the EGFR can occur through many distinct pathways (reviewed in Refs. 22Carpenter, G. (2000) Science's STKE http://www.stke.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/E1.Google Scholar and 36Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). One example is the extracellular release of EGF and other ErbB ligands through MMPs such as ADAM. The activation of MMPs by GPCRs occurs via PKC, Src, Pyk-2, or reactive oxide species. Furthermore, the transactivation of the EGFR can also occur through intracellular pathways including β-arrestin/Src, βγ subunit/Src, and the inhibitory effects of reactive oxide species on EGFR-specific phosphatases. We report here that the PGE2-induced transactivation of the EGFR in LS-174T cells occurs through the activation of Src. The use of Src-specific inhibitors can block the activation of Akt by PGE2. Also, PGE2 can induce the phosphorylation of Src on Tyr-418 which is a marker for Src activation. Because Src can act as a downstream effector of the EGFR, we sought to determine precisely where Src exerts its effects in the signaling cascade. We report here that the inhibition of Src completely blocks the activation of the EGFR. Furthermore, the inhibition of the EGFR had little effect on the ability of PGE2 to induce the activation of Src. Together, these data demonstrate that Src is a key mediator between the EP receptor and the EGFR. Although the direct mechanism for the EP receptor-mediated activation of Src was not determined in this study, it is one aspect of our ongoing investigation to understand the role of PGE2 in colorectal carcinogenesis. As indicated earlier, Src has been shown to be involved in both the activation of MMPs and subsequent release of ErbB ligands as well as the direct phosphorylation and activation of the EGFR. In order to examine the exact role of Src in this system, we determined the effect of neutralizing antibodies to EGF and EGF-like ligands in the PGE2-induced activation of Akt. The addition of neutralizing antibodies that bind specifically to individual members of the EGF family of ligands will block their association with the EGFR and inhibit its activation. We found that the addition of neutralizing antibodies to EGF, TGF-α, amphiregulin, HB-EGF, or betacellulin had no effect on the ability of PGE2 to induce the activation of Akt, although LS-174T cells produce mRNAs for all ligands. Even though the EP receptor has been shown by others to transactivate the EGFR through the extracellular release of TGF-α (28Pai R. Soreghan B. Szabo I.L. Pavelka M. Baatar D. Tarnawski A.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), none of the neutralizing antibodies we used had any effect on the PGE2-mediated activation of Akt (Fig. 4B). To confirm our results, we verified the ability of TGF-α neutralizing antibodies to inhibit TGF-α signaling in our system (Fig. 4C). In addition, pretreatment of LS-174T cells with neutralizing antibodies to TGF-α had no effect on the ability of PGE2 to induce migration (data not shown). The disparity in this finding is most likely due to cell type-specific differences and serves to underline the diversity of signaling events within colorectal carcinomas. Furthermore, we could not evaluate the effect of neutralizing antibodies to epiregulin because none are currently available. This would have been an interesting experiment because the LS-174T cells were shown to express high levels of epiregulin mRNA. Due to the inability of the MMP inhibitor, GM6001, to block the activation of Akt, we believe that the signaling events of PGE2, at least in these cells, occur prominently through an intracellular pathway. Our data also demonstrate the involvement of Src and the EGFR in the PGE2-induced migration and invasion of colorectal carcinoma cells. We found that the addition of the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors PD 153035 and AG 1478 completely inhibited the PGE2-induced migration and invasion of LS-174T cells. Similarly, we also found that the Src inhibitor, PP2, completely inhibited cell migration and invasion. We found similar effects with another Src inhibitor, PP1 (data not shown). The ability of the EGFR and Src inhibitors to completely block cell migration and invasion indicates that these mediators lie within the same signaling cascade. Conversely, the addition of the general MMP inhibitor GM6001 had no significant effect on cell migration although greatly inhibiting cell invasion. This indicates that MMP activity is not required for transactivation of the EGFR and cell migration but is required for cell invasion. This was expected because the activation of MMP-9 has been shown to be required for cell migration through Matrigel (37Xia M. Leppert D. Hauser S.L. Sreedharan S.P. Nelson P.J. Krensky A.M. Goetzl E.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 160-167PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that GM6001 fails to inhibit PGE2-induced activation of Akt and the lack of an effect by ErbB ligand neutralizing antibodies strongly suggest that the signal transduction pathway from the EP receptor to the EGFR occurs mainly via an intracellular pathway. We also analyzed the effects of PLC and adenylate cyclase inhibitors on the ability of PGE2 to induce colorectal carcinoma cell migration and invasion to evaluate other signaling events. The stimulation of the EP receptor induces the activation of Gαs and βγ subunits that can then activate the adenylate cyclase/cAMP/PKA and PLC/PKC pathways, respectively. However, we observed no inhibitory effects from either the PLCβ or adenylate cyclase inhibitors. We also found no effect of the PKA inhibitor, H-89, or the PKC inhibitor, Ro-31-8220, to block the activation of Akt by PGE2 (data not shown). Other reported pathways that can mediate the GPCR to EGFR signaling cascade have been shown, such as the activation of Src through β-arrestin (29Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar) or Gβγ subunits (27Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). These alternative pathways are currently under investigation in our laboratory. Since the first discovery of an increase in COX-2 expression in human cancers, the exact role of COX-2 and its derived prostaglandins have been the focus of many studies. To investigate if the transactivation of the EGFR by PGE2 might serve a functional role in colorectal carcinoma formation in vivo, we analyzed the expression and activation of EGFR versus the expression of COX-2 in normal and tumor sections from 4 human colorectal specimens and found a correlation between increased expression of COX-2 and the EGFR in 75% of the tumor samples. Furthermore, in the same tissues the EGFR was found to be highly phosphorylated. Hence, important interactions between these pathways may occur in vivo as well. Recently, Torrance et al. (38Torrance C.J. Jackson P.E. Montgomery E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Wissner A. Nunes M. Frost P. Discafani C.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1024-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) have shown that the use of a non-selective COX inhibitor in combination with an inhibitor to the EGFR can reduce the polyp formation in APCMin/+ mice much more effectively than either agent alone. In light of these studies, our findings that the PGE2-induced transactivation of the EGFR is required for stimulation of LS-174T cell migration and invasion are quite intriguing. In conclusion, our data demonstrate a direct intracellular communication further supporting the combinational use of COX-2 and EGFR inhibitors for cancer prevention or treatment. We strongly support clinical studies that would further evaluate the combination of agents that target both the COX-2 and EGFR pathways."

Previously, we suggested a synergy between TGF-beta1 activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Smad signaling in collagen production by human glomerular mesangial cells. In a heterologous DNA binding transcription assay, biochemical or dominant-negative ERK blockade reduced TGF-beta1 induced Smad3 activity. Total serine phosphorylation of Smad2/3, but not phosphorylation of the C-terminal SS(P)XS(P) motif, was decreased by pretreatment with the MEK/ERK inhibitors, PD98059 (10 microM) or U0126 (25 microM). This effect was not seen in the mouse mammary epithelial NMuMG cell line, indicating that ERK-dependent activation of Smad2/3 occurs only in certain cell types. TGF-beta stimulated phosphorylation of an expressed Smad3A construct, with a mutated C-terminal SS(P)XS(P) motif, was reduced by a MEK/ERK inhibitor. In contrast, MEK/ERK inhibition did not affect phosphorylation of a Smad3 construct mutated at consensus phosphorylation sites in the linker region (Smad3EPSM). Constitutively active MEK (caMEK) induced alpha2(I) collagen promoter activity, an effect blocked by co-transfected Smad3EPSM, but not Smad3A. The effects of caMEK and TGF-beta1 on collagen promoter activity were additive. These results indicate that ERK-dependent R-Smad linker region phosphorylation enhances collagen I synthesis and imply positive cross talk between the ERK and Smad pathways in human mesangial cells."

In the present study we explored the signaling events involved in this PKC-mediated effect, using the androgen-dependent LNCaP cell line as a model. Stimulation of PKC by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) leads to the activation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK in LNCaP cells. Here we present evidence that p38 MAPK, but not JNK, mediates PKC-induced apoptosis. Because LNCaP cells have hyperactivated Akt function due to PTEN inactivation, we examined whether this survival pathway could be affected by PKC activation. Interestingly, activation of PKC leads to a rapid and reversible dephosphorylation of Akt, an effect that was prevented by the pan-PKC inhibitor GF109302X and the cPKC inhibitor Gö6976. In addition, the diacylglycerol mimetic agent HK654, which selectively stimulates PKCα in LNCaP cells, also induced the dephosphorylation of Akt in LNCaP cells. Inactivation of Akt function by PKC does not involve the inhibition of PI3K, and it is prevented by okadaic acid, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase 2A in PMA-induced Akt dephosphorylation. Finally, we show that, when an activated form of Akt is delivered into LNCaP cells by either transient transfection or adenoviral infection, the apoptotic effect of PMA is significantly reduced. Our results highlight a complex array of signaling pathways regulated by PKC isozymes in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and suggest that both p38 MAPK and Akt play critical roles as downstream effectors of PKC isozymes in this cellular model.

PKC isozymes comprise a family of related serine-threonine kinases grouped on the basis oftheirstructuralandbiochemicalproperties:“classic”orcalcium-dependent PKCs (“cPKCs” α, βI, βII, and γ), “novel” or calcium-independent PKCs (“nPKCs” δ, ϵ, η, and θ) and “atypical” PKCs (“aPKCs” ζ and λ/ι). Only the first two groups and the related PKCμ/protein kinase D are responsive to phorbol esters and to the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG), the endogenous ligand for these PKCs (1Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 2Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J.

Phorbol ester treatment can either promote mitogenesis or inhibit cell proliferation depending on the cell type. Such heterogeneity is probably related to the multiplicity of cellular targets that mediate their responses, which include not only the PKC isozymes but also novel “non-kinase” phorbol ester receptors such as chimaerins, RasGRP isozymes, and Munc13s (4Kazanietz M.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Studies on the roles of individual phorbol ester receptors as mediators of mitogenic and survival responses have revealed a high degree of complexity in their downstream effectors. Indeed, within the PKC family some members are capable of stimulating mitogenesis, such as PKCϵ, whereas others such as PKCδ are preferentially growth inhibitory in most cell types. An emerging theme is that this heterogeneity involves a delicate regulation of signaling pathways by individual PKC isoforms, which is probably related to a distinctive pattern of intracellular compartmentalization and access to targets (1Ron D.

Using multiple pharmacological and molecular approaches, we have previously demonstrated that both the classic PKCα and the novel PKCδ mediate the apoptotic response of phorbol esters in LNCaP androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells. Although in some cell types the pro-apoptotic effect of PKCδ involves its proteolytic cleavage and subsequent release of an active catalytic fragment, in LNCaP cells it depends, rather, on allosteric activation of the enzyme upon translocation to the plasma membrane (12Fujii T.

The functional dissection of mitogenic and survival signaling cascades regulated by PKCs has proved elusive due to the diversity of PKC targets and cell type differences. To date, very little information is available regarding the pathways that mediate the apoptotic effect of phorbol esters in prostate cancer cells. Among the potential effectors downstream of PKC in prostate cancer cells are the MAPK cascades. It is well established that PKC isozymes activate the ERK MAPK cascade, and evidence has pointed to a potential role for JNK and p38 MAPK cascades as PKC effectors in some cell lines (14Schonwasser D.C.

The significance of each individual cascade and their relationship to PKC activation still remain to be elucidated in prostate cancer cells. PI3K-Akt has emerged as a critical pathway for cell survival in prostate cancer cells. The PTEN tumor suppressor, a phosphatase for the lipid products of PI3K, is frequently mutated in prostate cancer, and this loss in PTEN function is associated with constitutive activation of Akt. Hyperactivation of Akt has been found in cellular models of prostate cancer, such as LN-CaP cells, as well as in prostate cancer specimens, particularly in advanced stages of the disease (21Carson J.P.

In this report we sought to investigate the signaling events regulated by PKC isozymes in LNCaP prostate cancer cells and their relationship to the apoptotic response of phorbol esters and DAG mimetics. Using a series of pharmacological and molecular approaches, we determined a critical role for p38 MAPK and Akt in PKC-mediated apoptosis. A relevant finding was that activation of PKCα leads to the dephosphorylation and inactivation of Akt, raising the attractive possibility that inhibition of Akt function upon PKC activation is a crucial event in triggering the apoptotic response of phorbol esters in LNCaP cells. Materials—Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), PKC inhibitors (GF109203X, Gö6976, rottlerin), p38 MAPK inhibitors (SB 202190, SB 203580, and PD 169316), and the MEK1 inhibitor PD 980591 were purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). The JNK inhibitor SP 600125 was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals. HK654 was synthesized in the laboratory of Dr. Victor Marquez (NCI, National Institutes of Health) (13Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Leskow F.C. Fujii T. Wang Q. Blumberg P.M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Han K.C. Lee J. Marquez V.E. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol.

Cell culture reagents and media were purchased from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). Cell Culture—LNCaP human prostate cancer cells were purchased from the ATCC. LNCaP cells (passages 2–10) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin (100 units/ml)-streptomycin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transfections—Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at ∼70% confluence and transfected with different mammalian expression vectors (1–2 μg) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Infection of LNCaP Cells with PKC and Akt Adenoviruses—Generation of AdVs for PKCα and PKCδ was described elsewhere (12Fujii T. García-Bermejo M.L. Bernabó J.L. Caamaño J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L.

AdVs for wild-type Akt1, as well as for constitutively active (Myr-Akt1) and kinase-inactive (T308A,S473A) Akt1 mutants were previously described (25Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). AdVs were amplified in HEK293 cells using standard techniques (26Berkner K.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 158: 39-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Titers of viral stocks were normally higher than 1 × 109 pfu/cell. Subconfluent LNCaP cells in 6- or 12-well plates were infected with AdVs for 14 h at multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) values ranging from 1 to 30 pfu/cell in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% FBS. After removal of the virus, cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Maximum expression after adenoviral infection was achieved using this protocol. Expression of the recombinant protein remained stable throughout the duration of the experiment. A LacZ AdV was used as a control (12Fujii T. García-Bermejo M.L. Bernabó J.L. Caamaño J. Ohba M.

Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested into lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol and then lysed by sonication. Equal amounts of protein (10 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk or 5% bovine serum albumin in 0.05% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with the first antibody for 1 h. Membranes were then washed three times with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated to anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:3000, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Bands were visualized by using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection system. Densitometric analysis was performed under conditions that yielded a linear response. The following first antibodies were used: anti-PKCα (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-PKCδ and anti-total-JNK (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); anti-total-ATF2 and anti-phospho-ATF2 (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA); anti-phospho-PKCα, anti-total-Akt, anti-phospho-Akt, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-phospho-PDK1, anti-total-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2), anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK, anti-total-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-total-GSK-3, and anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). All of the antibodies were used at a 1:1000 dilution except for anti-PKCα, which was used at a 1:300 dilution. Apoptosis Assays—To assess morphological changes in chromatin structure of LNCaP cells undergoing apoptosis, cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). Cells were trypsinized, mounted on glass slides, and fixed in 70% ethanol or 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were then stained for 20 min with 1 mg/ml DAPI. Apoptosis was characterized by chromatin condensation and fragmentation when examined by fluorescence microscopy. The incidence of apoptosis in each preparation was analyzed by counting 500 cells and determining the percentage of apoptotic cells. We have previously determined that results observed by these methods essentially matched those observed by flow cytometry and correlate with DNA laddering analysis (12Fujii T. García-Bermejo M.L.

Akt Kinase Assay—The Akt kinase assay was performed using the non-radioactive Akt kinase assay kit from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., following the instructions from manufacturer. Akt kinase activity was assayed by phosphorylation of GSK-3 fusion protein, which was analyzed by Western blot using a phospho-GSK-3 antibody. PI3K Assay—Cells were harvested into Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaVO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were incubated with 2 μg of anti-PI3K p85α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 °C for 1 h and then with 30 μl of Protein A-agarose (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) at 4 °C for 1 h. Agarose beads were washed extensively and then resuspended in 30 μl of a substrate solution (100 μg of phosphatidylinositol in 50 μl of 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.3). The agarose beads were then sonicated and 200 μl of kinase buffer (15 mm β-glycerophosphate, 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm HEPES), and 50 μl of 60 mm MgCl2 was added. The kinase reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence of 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl, and then 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1) was added to the samples. Five microliters of bottom phase were spotted onto a TLC plate and run in methanol/chloroform/water/ammonium hydroxide (8:6:2:1). The plates were dried overnight and then subjected to autoradiography. RNA Interference—A 21-bp dsRNA for PKCδ was generated (CCAUGAGUUUAUCGCCACCTT) and purchased from Dharmacon Research, Inc. The dsRNA was transfected into LNCaP cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were treated with 100 nm PMA for 15 min, and the cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot. Protein Determination—Protein determinations were performed with the Micro BCA Protein Assay from Pierce, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Effect of p38 MAPK, JNK, and MEK1 Inhibitors on PKC-mediated Apoptosis in LNCaP Cells—It is well established that androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells undergo apoptosis when treated with phorbol esters (9Powell C.T.

We have previously reported that short term treatment of LNCaP cells with either PMA or DAG analogs results in a large number of apoptotic cells, as determined by nuclear fragmentation assays, flow cytometry, and DNA laddering (12Fujii T. García-Bermejo M.L. Bernabó J.L. Caamaño J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol.

To begin elucidating the signaling events that mediate this effect, we first analyzed the activation of different MAPKs in LNCaP cells using phospho-specific antibodies. A rapid increase in phospho-ERK1/2 MAPK, phospho-p38 MAPK, and phospho-JNK was observed upon PMA treatment (Fig. 1). To determine whether the different cascades play any role as mediators of PMA-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells, we used pharmacological inhibitors of the different pathways. Treatment of cells with SB 203580, a well-established inhibitor of p38 MAPK (27Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar), inhibited the apoptotic effect of PMA in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2A), suggesting a role for p38 MAPK in PKC-mediated apoptosis. To further confirm the involvement of p38 MAPK, we tested two additional p38 MAPK inhibitors, SB 202190 and PD 169316 (28Young P.R. McLaughlin M.M. Kumar S. Kassis S. Doyle M.L. McNulty D. Gallagher T.F. Fisher S. McDonnell P.C. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Seibel G. Porter T.G. Livi G.P. Adams J.L. Lee J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12116-12121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). These two p38 MAPK inhibitors also reduced dose-dependently PMA-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2, B and C). At a concentration of 10 μm, SB 203580, SB 202190, and PD 169316 inhibited apoptosis by 63, 62, and 69%, respectively. On the other hand, the JNK inhibitor SP 600125 (29Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-62001Crossref PubMed Scopus (2244) Google Scholar) did not inhibit the apoptotic effect of PMA, even at very high concentrations (50 μm) (Fig. 2D). The efficacy of SP 600125 was confirmed by its ability to block c-Jun phosphorylation upon PMA treatment (Fig. 2E). We then analyzed the effect of PD 98059, an inhibitor of MEK1, the kinase responsible for the activation of ERK1/2 MAPKs. Contrary to the effect observed with the p38 MAPK inhibitors, PD 98059 (10 μm) significantly potentiated apoptosis by 50% (for 30 nm PMA) or 41% (for 100 nm PMA), as shown in Fig. 2F.Fig. 2Effect of p38 MAPK, JNK, and MEK1 inhibitors on PMA-induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells. LNCaP cells were treated with 100 nm PMA or vehicle for 1 h, in the presence or absence of different concentrations of p38 MAPK inhibitors SB 203580 (A), SB 202190 (B), or PD 169316 (C) or the JNK inhibitor SP 600125 (D), which were added 40 min before and during PMA treatment. Cells were collected 24 h later and stained with DAPI, and the incidence of apoptosis was analyzed by counting 500 cells and determining the percentage of apoptosis on each sample. E, cells were treated with 100 nm PMA or vehicle for 50 min in the presence or absence of the JNK inhibitor SP 600125 (10 μm), which was added 40 min before and during PMA treatment. The expression levels of phospho- and total-c-Jun were analyzed by Western blot. F, cells were treated with different concentrations of PMA for 1 h, either in the presence or absence of the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 (10 μm) added 40 min before and during PMA treatment. Cells were collected 24 h later and stained with DAPI, and the incidence of apoptotic cells was assessed as described above.

An approach to achieve isozyme-specific responses consists in overexpressing individual PKC isozymes using adenoviruses (AdVs), which could be then selectively activated by a low concentration of PMA that would normally be insufficient to trigger a response (12Fujii T. García-Bermejo M.L. Bernabó J.L. Caamaño J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol.

LNCaP cells were infected with either PKCα AdV or PKCδ AdV, which resulted in the overexpression of the corresponding PKC, as judged by Western blot analysis, [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding, and PKC kinase activity (see Refs. 12Fujii T.

PMA (3 nm), which produces only a marginal apoptotic response in control (LacZ AdV-infected) cells, induced a marked apoptotic effect in PKCα-orPKCδ-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3A) that is proportional to the level of expression of the corresponding PKC isozyme (Fig. 3A, inset). In this later case, PKCα- or PKCδ-driven apoptosis could be specifically inhibited by the cPKC inhibitor Gö6976 and the PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin, respectively (data not shown and Refs. 12Fujii T.

In LNCaP cells overexpressing either PKCα or PKCδ, pretreatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 significantly reduced the apoptotic effect of PMA (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the MEK1 inhibitor PD 98059, which markedly inhibited ERK1/2 MAPK activation in LNCaP cells (Fig. 3D), potentiated PMA-induced apoptosis in cells overexpressing either PKCα or PKCδ (after infection with the corresponding AdVs at an m.o.i. of 30 pfu/cell). The effect was more pronounced in PKCα-overexpressing cells, in which the number of apoptotic cells observed after 10 nm PMA treatment was nearly doubled in the presence of the MEK1 inhibitor (Fig. 3C). Thus, a differential involvement of MAPK cascades is observed upon PKC activation in LNCaP cells. PMA Induces the Dephosphorylation of Akt in LNCaP Cells— The central role of the PI3K-Akt pathway in LNCaP prostate cancer cell survival prompted us to investigate whether PKC-induced apoptosis involves any changes in this signaling pathway. It is well established that Akt is hyperactivated in LNCaP cells (21Carson J.P. Kulik G. Weber"

The juxtamembrane domain c-Kit mutants likely disrupt the binding of regulatory proteins, resulting in autophosphorylation and kinase activation. The transforming kinase domain mutants likely stabilize the active conformation of the c-Kit activation loop (A-loop). Similar mutations in A-loop residues in the MET and fibroblast growth factor 3 receptors are highly phosphorylated when expressed in vivo without added ligand (20Naski M.C. Wang Q. Xu J. Ornitz D.M.

The success of STI-571 (also known by the trade names Gleevec and Imatinib) in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia is based on the inhibition of the c-Abl kinase, whose activity, like c-Kit's, is tightly controlled in normal cells. STI-571 targets the inactive kinase structure with unphosphorylated A-loop residues, particularly the kinase DFG motif, occupying the binding sites for substrate tyrosine-containing polypeptides (24Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). STI-571 can also be an effective treatment for other human cancers including gastrointestinal stromal tumors and stems from STI-571 inhibition of c-Kit kinase, particularly those with activating mutations in the juxtamembrane domain. Regrettably, STI-571 is less effective in treating cancers with activating mutations in the c-Kit kinase domain (25Zermati Y. De Sepulveda P. Feger F. Letard S. Kersual J. Casteran N. Gorochev G.

We report here on the enzymatic activity, phosphopeptide mapping, and the crystal structure of a c-Kit kinase-product complex. These results provide the molecular basis for understanding the mechanism of c-Kit kinase transactivation and is an essential step for the structure-guided design of specific c-Kit kinase inhibitors.MATERIALS AND METHODSEnzyme Expression and Purification—The catalytic domain of the human c-kit gene (residues 544–935; GenBank™ accession number NM_000222 (4Coussens L.

The kinase insertion domain residues 694–753 were deleted and replaced with 6 nucleotides encoding Thr-Ser. Recombinant c-Kit protein with a 6x-histidine tag followed by an rTEV protease site was expressed in 5L of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells using 10L Wave BioReactors (Wave Biotech) and ESF-921 protein-free medium (Expression Systems). Recombinant c-Kit protein was obtained at a yield of 1.8 mg/liter of cell culture and purified by binding to ProBond resin (Invitrogen) and washing with 20 mm imidazole to remove contaminating proteins, and c-Kit protein was eluted with 200 mm imidazole buffer. The His6 tag was removed with rTEV protease (Invitrogen) and uncleaved material removed by a second passage over ProBond. The purified c-Kit protein was not phosphorylated as judged by mass spectrometry (data not shown) and was concentrated to 6 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C.Phosphorylation Sites Mapping by LC/MS/MS—The autophosphorylation reaction was initiated by addition of 5 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2 at 20 °C and quenched after 1 h with 20 mm EDTA, and the sample was digested at 20:1 (w/w) ratio using a modified trypsin (Promega) in Tris buffer at 37 °C for 16 h. Tryptic digests were analyzed using a 0.3 × 150-mm 5-μm C18 PepMap capillary column (LC Packings). A 0.3 × 5-mm 5-μm C18 u-Precolumn cartridge (LCPackings) was used to trap and rapidly desalt the tryptic peptides. A capillary flow rate at 10 μl/min was generated using a Paradigm MS4 multidimensional separations module (Michrom BioResources) operated at 150 μL/min and split to 10 μl/min with the built-in variable splitter. MS spectra (m/z 150–2000) and data-dependent MS/MS spectra were acquired on a LCQ DECA ion trap (Finnigan Corp.). Turbo Sequest protein identification software was used to locate the phosphorylation sites on the peptides.Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals of c-Kit kinase were obtained by preincubating active enzyme samples (6 mg/ml, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.9) with 2.5 mm ATP and 5 mm MgCl2, and were grown at room temperature by sitting-drop vapor diffusion using 50 nl of protein solution and 50 nl of reservoir (18% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m MES, pH 7.1). Crystals were harvested in reservoir solution supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol and flash-frozen by direct immersion in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Light Source Beam Line 5.0.3 and were integrated and scaled using HKL2000 (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P21212, a = 92.7Å, b = 116.4 Å, and c = 60.1 Å, and have two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Data collection and structure refinement statistics are listed in Table I. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe (27Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) with the VEGFR2 receptor kinase (Protein Data Bank code 1VR2) used as a search model. The correct solutions yielded the highest correlation coefficients in the rotation and translation searches. The model was refined without non-crystallographic symmetry restraints in REFMAC (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Since the +2 precursor ions usually yield better MS/MS fragmentation patterns than the +3 precursor ions, we programmed the mass spectrometer to switch automatically to acquire MS/MS spectra if the +2 of the diphosphorylated peptide precursor ion (m/z 1441.4) was detected. The LC/MS/MS spectrum for the diphosphotryptic peptide shows the presence of a series of y- and b-type ions to confirm the sequence assignment (Fig. 2). The y and b ion assignments localize the phosphorylation sites to Tyr-568 and Tyr-570.Fig. 2LC/MS/MS spectrum of the diphosphorylated peptide, VVEEINGNN(pY)V(pY)IDPTQLPYDHK.

The electron density is clear and unambiguous for the active site and for most of the enzyme secondary structure and connecting loops. Over 97% of the residues in both enzyme molecules in the asymmetric unit are within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot of main chain (ϕ/φ) torsion angles, and a significant portion of both structures is ordered. The amino-terminal ∼20 amino acid residues of both enzymes are disordered, as are the residues comprising the truncated kinase insertion domain. The conformations of both the A-loop and flexible, glycine-rich P-loop, which forms a key part of the active site, are consistent with an active kinase structure (Fig. 3).Fig. 3Structure of active c-Kit kinase. The Cα ribbon illustrates the two-domain kinase fold and key structural elements, including the C-helix, phosphate-binding P-loop, adenine-recognition hinge loop, and kinase activation A-loop. The positions of the ADP, metal ion, and substrate peptide are also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The global architecture of c-Kit kinase resembles the conserved protein serine/threonine kinase two-domain fold, with a smaller, amino-terminal N-lobe comprised of mostly β-strands, and a larger predominantly α-helical carboxy-terminal C-lobe (Fig. 3). The N-lobe contains a single α-helix, designated the control or C-helix, which directly contacts the A-loop DFG motif and nucleotide binding site and commonly modulates kinase activity in regulatory mechanisms. The c-Kit C-helix is in a conformation consistent with productive nucleotide binding. The conserved C-helix glutamic acid, Glu-640, forms a critical interaction with the side chain of buried Lys-623, which orients and positions the Lys-623 Nϵ atom to bridge the α- and β-phosphates of the bound ADP. The DFG motif is also in an active state consistent with binding a Mg2+ ion that coordinates Asn-797, the ADP α- and β-phosphates, and the phosphate of phosphotyrosine (PTR)-568 from an adjacent molecule (Fig. 4).Fig. 4The c-Kit active site. Interactions at the c-Kit active site with Mg2+, ADP, and phosphotyrosine are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nucleotide Binding and Active Kinase Structure—The c-Kit active site centers around the bound ADP and Mg2+ ion. ADP binds in the interdomain cleft between the N- and C-lobes, inserting the adenine base into a hydrophobic pocket with the adenine N1 atom and exocyclic N6 amino group forming hydrogen bonds to the polypeptide backbone amide and carbonyl groups of the hinge region residues Cys-673 and Glu-671, respectively (Fig. 4). The ribose sugar O2′ hydroxyl contacts Asp-677, and the O3′ group forms a hydrogen bond with the Arg-796 carbonyl. The O4′ side of the ribose sugar packs with Gly-596, the first residue of the c-Kit P-loop sequence. The other P-loop residues contact the ADP phosphates, with Phe-600 capping the active site to shield the transphosphorylation reaction from bulk solvent (Fig. 4).The c-Kit kinase enzyme active site is fully competent for autophosphorylation as evidenced by the presence of both phosphotyrosine residues identified from the MS analyses (PTR-568 and PTR-570) in the bound substrate peptides. These peptides, from adjacent enzyme molecules in the crystal, bind in trans by inserting between the backside of the A-loop and conserved structural elements of the C-lobe (Figs. 3 and 4). Consistent with the known biology of the Type III RPTK family, the target tyrosine residues are immediately adjacent to the conserved kinase domain fold, and the length of the polypeptide chain is insufficient for the enzyme to perform the autophosphorylation reaction in cis. Binding of the substrate is enhanced by a salt link between Arg-830 and PTR-570 and by hydrophobic interactions between Val-569, Ile-571, and Ile-576 with hydrophobic residues emanating from the C-lobe of the kinase. Substrate binding may stabilize the active conformation of the kinase A loop, despite the fact that the target A loop tyrosine, Tyr-823, is not phosphorylated. In support of the conclusion that the c-Kit A loop is in a biologically relevant active conformation, Tyr-823 is within hydrogen-bonding distance of the side chain of the conserved A loop residue Arg-815, with the side chain of Arg-791 also in the vicinity. The positive charge of the side chains on these arginine residues would counterbalance the negative charge of a phosphorylated Tyr-823 and further stabilize the A loop in an active conformation.DISCUSSIONInterest in c-Kit stems from the disease-causing effects of its constitutive activation in cells. In the normal “off” state c-Kit receptor exists as a monomer in the cell membrane. Binding of SCF induces the c-Kit receptor to dimerize and, acting as both enzyme and substrate for itself, c-Kit autophosphorylates specific NH2-terminal tyrosine residues in trans. Unlike most other protein kinases whose targets are separate and distinct cellular proteins, these autophosphorylated phosphotyrosine residues are themselves the signal that activates intracellular serine/threonine protein kinase signaling cascades to determine specific cellular responses in normal cellular growth and development (Fig. 1). We have characterized and determined the crystal structure of active c-Kit kinase to gain an understanding of the molecular basis underlying oncogenic transformation by activating c-Kit mutations. We performed autophosphorylation reactions with a c-Kit construct that contained the critical NH2-terminal target tyrosine residues. For c-Kit autophosphorylated to the +2 diphosphotyrosine state, only Tyr-568 and Tyr-570 are significantly phosphorylated, and thus these two residues are likely among the first to be phosphorylated. Interestingly, when longer incubation times are employed we observe higher levels of autophosphorylation, and our data suggest that the A loop residue Tyr-823 is the last tyrosine residue to be autophosphorylated. As supported by the crystal structure of the active c-Kit kinase, in which the A loop is ordered and in an active conformation, phosphorylation of Tyr-823 is apparently not required to activate the kinase. These results are in contrast with those obtained for most other kinases in which phosphorylation of target A-loop residues is required to stabilize the kinase in an active state (reviewed in Ref. 30Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). Thus, in normal non-phosphorylated, monomeric c-Kit receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, the kinase domain may be poised at or near its active configuration, and that it is only the physical separation of two individual kinase domains that prevents their transactivation. Thus, the active c-Kit kinase domain structure reported here represents the kinase conformation that is resistant to inhibition by STI-571 and will facilitate the design of specific and potent c-Kit kinase inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2156990953,"GADD34 is a protein that is induced by stresses such as DNA damage. The function of mammalian GADD34 has been proposed by in vitro transfection, but its function in vivo has not yet been elucidated. Here we generated and analyzed GADD34 knockout mice. Despite their embryonic stage- and tissue-specific expressions, GADD34 knockout mice showed no abnormalities at fetal development and in early adult life. However, in GADD34-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), recovery from a shutoff of protein synthesis was delayed when MEFs were exposed to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2alpha) at Ser51 induced by thapsigargin or DTT was prolonged in GADD34-/- MEF, although following treatment with tunicamycin, the eIF2alpha phosphorylation level did not change in either GADD34+/+ or GADD34-/- cells. ER stress stimuli induced expressions of Bip (binding Ig protein) and CHOP (C/EBP homologous protein) in MEF of wild-type mice. These expressions were strongly reduced in GADD34-/- MEF, which suggests that GADD34 up-regulates Bip and CHOP. These results indicate that GADD34 works as a sensor of ER stress stimuli and recovers cells from shutoff of protein synthesis."

Novel approaches to characterize the mechanism of action of antifungal agents will be of great use in the antifungal drug development process. The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in the gene expression profile of Saccharomyces cerevisiae following exposure to representatives of the four currently available classes of antifungal agents used in the management of systemic fungal infections. Microarray analysis indicated differential expression of 0.8, 4.1, 3.0, and 2.6% of the genes represented on the Affymetrix S98 yeast gene array in response to ketoconazole, amphotericin B, caspofungin, and 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), respectively. Quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-PCR was used to confirm the microarray analyses. Genes responsive to ketoconazole, caspofungin, and 5-FC were indicative of the drug-specific effects. Ketoconazole exposure primarily affected genes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis and sterol uptake; caspofungin exposure affected genes involved in cell wall integrity; and 5-FC affected genes involved in DNA and protein synthesis, DNA damage repair, and cell cycle control. In contrast, amphotericin B elicited changes in gene expression reflecting cell stress, membrane reconstruction, transport, phosphate uptake, and cell wall integrity. Genes with the greatest specificity for a particular drug were grouped together as drug-specific genes, whereas genes with a lack of drug specificity were also identified. Taken together, these data shed new light on the mechanisms of action of these classes of antifungal agents and demonstrate the potential utility of gene expression profiling in antifungal drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2030307027,"Increased VEGF expression is found in several pathologies characterized by abnormal angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that the transcription factor STAT3 mediates VEGF gene transcription and its activation. In this study, Western analysis and confocal immunocytochemistry were used to examine STAT3 activation in retinal microvascular endothelial cells (BREC). We found that VEGF rapidly induces STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Immunoprecipitation studies also showed that VEGF forms a complex with VEGFR2 only in BREC and not in aortic macrovascular endothelial cells (BAEC). In addition, quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of VEGF-induced VEGF expression showed a significant increase in specific mRNA formation only in BREC and not in BAEC, and this effect was significantly reduced by antisense-mediated reduction of STAT3 expression. Furthermore, studies conducted in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) showed that, in this endothelial cell type, VEGF autocrine expression is also accompanied by STAT3 activation as in BREC. In this study we showed that VEGF can differentially induce STAT3 activation in micro- versus macro-vascular endothelial cells and that this effect is linked to VEGFR2/STAT3 complex formation, which correlates with VEGF autocrine ability to stimulate its own gene expression."

Either DNase or phosphatase treatment of the insoluble fraction released 53BP1 into the soluble fraction, showing that 53BP1 binds to chromatin in a phosphorylation-dependent manner after X-irradiation of cells. 53BP1 was retained at discrete nuclear foci in X-irradiated cells even after detergent extraction of cells, showing that the chromatin binding of 53BP1 occurs at sites of DNA double-strand breaks.

We conclude that 53BP1 has the potential to participate directly in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks. A DNA double-strand break (DSB) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-strand break; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; IR, ionizing radiation; Gy, gray; UV, ultraviolet; HU, hydroxyurea; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NHEJ, non-homologous end joining; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; KBD, kinetochore-binding domain. is one of the most serious threats to cells because it can result in loss or rearrangement of genetic information, that leads to cell death or carcinogenesis. DSBs can be induced by ionizing radiation (IR) and arise in endogenous normal processes of cells such as DNA replication, meiosis, and V(D)J recombination. The induction of DSBs activates various sophisticated pathways, termed cell-cycle checkpoints, which monitor DNA damage and transduce signals to coordinate repair and cell cycle progression (reviewed in Refs. 1Weinert T. Cell. 1998; 94: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and 2Zhou B.-B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). DSBs are repaired by two major pathways, homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (reviewed in Ref. 3Jeggo P.A. Hall J.C. Dunlap J.C. Freidmann T. Giannelli F. Advances in Genetics. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 185-221Google Scholar). HR uses a DNA molecule with significant length of sequence homology to prime the repair DNA synthesis, allowing for accurate repair of the lesions. In contrast, NHEJ rejoins DNA ends with the use of little or no sequence homology, leading to imprecise joining. The repair of DSBs by NHEJ requires at least five proteins (reviewed in Ref. 4Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Three are components of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex, the two DNA end-binding subunits of Ku (Ku70 and Ku80), and the catalytic subunit termed DNA-PKcs. The remaining two are DNA ligase IV and Xrcc4. It is thought that broken termini are recognized by the Ku heterodimer, which then recruits DNA-PKcs, thereby activating its kinase activity. This large complex serves to protect the DNA ends from nuclease attack, while also facilitating the recruitment of the DNA ligase IV/Xrcc4 heterodimer. Although it is not at present clear how end-bridging is achieved, these reactions result in the religation of the DSBs, restoring the integrity of the DNA (5Hanakahi L.A. Bartlet-Jones M. Chappell C.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), suggesting the role of 53BP1 in these aspects. Consistent with this, upon exposure of cells to IR, 53BP1 has been shown to relocalize rapidly to sites of DNA DSBs forming discrete nuclear foci and to be hyperphosphorylated in an Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM)-dependent manner (14Anderson L.

ATM is a central signaling kinase in the response for DSBs, and upon activation in response to IR, ATM phosphorylates many proteins involved in checkpoint or DNA repair (reviewed in Ref. 18Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). On the basis of its high similarity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad9 in the BRCT motifs (8Derbyshire D.J. Basu B.P. Joo W.S. Iwabuchi K. Doherty A.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3863-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 10Joo W.S. Jeffrey P.D. Cantor S.B. Finnin M.S. Livingston D.M. Pavletich N.P. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), 53BP1 is thought to be a candidate for a human counterpart of Rad9 (2Zhou B.-B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). Rad9, an essential protein for the cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damage (19Weinert T.A. Hartwell L.H. Science. 1988; 241: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar), becomes phosphorylated in response to DNA damage in dependent on Mec1, the functional S. cerevisiae homologue of ATM (20Emili A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5678-5688Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated Rad9 interacts physically with Rad53, the S. cerevisiae homologue of a checkpoint kinase Chk2, and this interaction is required for subsequent phosphorylation and activation of Rad53 (20Emili A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 183-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21Vialard J.E. Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F.

Recently, like Rad9 and Rad53, 53BP1 has been shown to bind to Chk2, although this interaction is disrupted by treatment of cells with IR (23Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1435-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Furthermore, experiments using small interfering RNA or gene targeting to knock-down 53BP1 expression have revealed that 53BP1 is required for accumulation of p53 protein, G2-M checkpoint, intra-S-phase checkpoint, and phosphorylation of at least a subset of ATM substrates such as Chk2, BRCA1 and SMC1 in response to IR damage (23Wang B.

Although the roles of 53BP1 in DNA damage checkpoint having been elucidated, it is unclear whether 53BP1 has roles in the repair of DNA DSBs. Here we report that 53BP1 binds to chromatin in vivo after treatment of cells with x-ray, but not with ultraviolet (UV) or hydroxyurea (HU). The minimal domain for focus formation consists of conserved Tudor and Myb motifs. The Tudor plus Myb domain possesses chromatin binding activity in vivo and binds directly to both double-stranded (ds) and single-stranded (ss) DNA in vitro. This domain also stimulates end-joining by DNA ligase IV/Xrcc4, but not by T4 DNA ligase. We conclude that 53BP1 has the potential to participate directly in the DNA double-strand break repair. Antibodies—A monoclonal anti-53BP1 antibody, 2B6, was prepared using a recombinant protein consisting of the 361 N-terminal residues of 53BP1 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) as an antigen. Monoclonal antibodies recognizing BRCA1 (clone MS110) and Rho A (clone 26C4) were obtained from Oncogene Research Product and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Anti-Actin and anti-Orc2 antibodies were obtained from Sigma and BD Pharmingen, respectively. A monoclonal antibody recognizing the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tag (clone 12CA5) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Plasmids—Plasmids expressing HA-tagged full 53BP1, the C-terminal half of 53BP1 (53BP1-C) and the N-terminal half of 53BP1 (53BP1-N), pCMH6K53BP1, pCMH6K53BP1-C and pCMH6K53BP1-N respectively, were described (7Iwabuchi K.

The BsrFI end of a 5.2-kb NheI-BsrFI fragment from pCMH6K53BP1 was filled-in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. This fragment was then ligated between the NheI site and the HpaI site of pCMH6K (7Iwabuchi K. Li B. Massa H.F. Trask B.J. Date T. Fields S. J. Biol.

A 0.13-kb EcoRV-NcoI 53BP1 fragment containing the 53BP1 nuclear localization signal (NLS) was isolated from pCMH6K53BP1. The NcoI end was filled-in, and then this fragment was ligated into the HpaI site of pCMH6K53BP1-N to generate pCMH6KNLS53BP1-N. 53BP1cDNA insert coding residues 1617–1710, which include 53BP1 NLS, was generated by PCR and ligated into the BamHI site of pCMH6K to produce pCMH6KNLSC. Inserts for plasmids expressing 53BP1-deletion mutants, KBD, KBD-N, KBD-C, Tudor, KBD-CC, KBD-NN, and KBD-M (Fig. 5A), were generated by PCR and were ligated into the upstream BamHI site of pCMH6KNLSC. Inserts for plasmids producing 53BP1 recombinant proteins or a HCV core (residues 1–90) protein were generated by PCR. Inserts for 53BP1-N1, -N2, -N3, -N4, -CΔBRCT, -BRCT (Fig. 6A) and HCV core, were ligated into the BamHI site of pGEX-3X (Amersham Biosciences). Inserts for KBD, KBD-N, KBD-C, Tudor, KBD-CC, KBD-NN, and KBD-M were ligated between the BamHI and the PstI site of pRSET C (Invitrogen).Fig. 653BP1 possesses two DNA-binding domains.

Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere, at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transfection of cells was done using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's protocol. X-irradiation was conducted using an x-ray irradiator (Hitachi MediCo.). UV-irradiation was delivered using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). HU was added to cultures at a final concentration of 1 mm. Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 2% SDS-PBS and sheared by passing through a 26-gauge needle. For preparation of the soluble and insoluble fractions, cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in TNE (pH 8.0) buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate), and the resultant lysate was divided into the soluble and insoluble fractions by centrifugation. The insoluble fraction was resolved in 2% SDS-PBS, and sheared by passing through a 26 gauge needle. For cell lysis with DNase or RNase, cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in TNE (pH 8.0) buffer depleted with EDTA and supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2 in the presence of 200 μg/ml RNase (Sigma), 200 μg/ml DNase (Sigma) or 200 μg/ml DNase with 5 mm EDTA. In phosphatase treatment, cells were lysed in TNE (pH 8.5) buffer without phosphatase inhibitors. 200 units/ml of alkaline phosphatase was added to the resultant cell lysate. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the cell lysate was separated as described above. The protein concentrations of whole cell extracts and cell lysates were determined by the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (7Iwabuchi K. Li B.

In Situ Detergent Extraction and Immunostaining—MCF7 cells were grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes. In some experiments, cells were transfected with plasmids expressing 53BP1-deletion mutants. Cells untreated or irradiated with x-ray were permeabilized in extraction buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate) for 20 min on ice. The buffer was removed and the procedure was repeated for additional incubations on ice, of 10 min and 5 min. Cells were fixed in methanol acetone (70:30) for 5 min at 4 °C. After each step, cells were rinsed three times with PBS. Nonextracted cells were fixed and permeabilized as described above. Cells were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 10 min and then incubated with anti-53BP1 (1.5 μg/ml) or anti-HA (1.0 μg/ml) antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. After extensive washing, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresarch Laboratories) at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were counterstained with propidium iodide (PI) or 4′,6′ diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and inspected using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus). Images were acquired with a digital camera (Olympus) and processed using Adobe Photoshop. In Vitro DNA Binding Assay—Synthesis of GST fusion proteins and their partial purification were performed as described (6Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In a screening DNA binding assay, GST fusion proteins and GST were separated in parallel by two SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The first gel was stained with the Coomassie dye and the second gel was washed with renature buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) twice at room temperature for 30 min followed by twice at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Then the second gel was equilibrated in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA) and was reset in a slab gel apparatus. 20 ng of dsDNA generated by annealing an oligonucleotide 5′-AACTCGAGTT-3′ and labeled at the 5′-ends with [γ-32P]ATP, was loaded to each well of the gel. Electrophoresis was performed in TAE buffer until bromphenol blue (BPB) dye in the second gel reached to the corresponding BPB site of the first gel. The second gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. In agarose gel mobility shift assays, dsDNA (uncut pUC18 or digested with EcoRI) or ss plasmid DNA (M13mp18) was incubated with protein samples for 1 h at room temperature followed by electrophoresis of the samples in a 1% agarose gel at 100 V for 1 h.

Reactions with 53BP1 fragments were preincubated for 30 min on ice (from 100 to 2500 ng/reaction), and ligation was initiated by addition of the enzyme and transfer to 37 °C for DNA ligase IV/Xrcc4 and 20 °C for T4 DNA ligase, respectively. After the incubation, the reactions were deproteinized, phenol/chloroform extracted and precipitated with Pellet-Paint coprecipitant (Novagen). Aliquots of the reactions were run on 0.8% agarose gels. Dried gels were analyzed and quantified using STORM phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). 53BP1 Binds to Chromatin in Vivo at Sites of DSBs after X-irradiation of Cells—As 53BP1 forms foci at sites of DSBs (14Anderson L.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), we asked whether 53BP1 bound to chromatin after exposure of cells to IR. To determine this possibility, we examined the amount of 53BP1 in the soluble and insoluble fractions of cell lysates prepared in 0.5% Nonidet-P 40 (see “Experimental Procedures”). If 53BP1 binds to chromatin it should change its localization, like human Rad9 (27Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), from the soluble to insoluble fraction, the latter being enriched for chromatin. A soluble protein (Rho A) and a chromatin-binding protein (Orc2) were well separated by the fractionation (Fig. 1A, left panel). We found that the level of soluble 53BP1 was dramatically reduced in response to X-irradiation (Fig. 1A, left panel and right panel, lanes 1 and 2). Concomitant with the decrease of soluble 53BP1 protein, the amount of insoluble 53BP1 increased after irradiation (Fig. 1A, left panel and right panel, lanes 6 and 7). To determine whether 53BP1 in the detergent-insoluble fraction was bound to chromatin, we examined the effect of DNA digestion. Irradiated cells were permeabilized in the presence of RNase, DNase with or without EDTA, or no treatment. DNA digestion almost fully restored the amount of soluble 53BP1 in X-irradiated cells (Fig. 1A, right panel, lane 3). In accord with this, 53BP1 in the DNase-treated insoluble fraction decreased to an undetectable level (Fig. 1A, right panel, lane 8). Treatment with RNase or DNase plus EDTA did not result in an increase of soluble 53BP1 in irradiated cells, ruling out nonspecific effects of the DNase preparation. X-irradiation did not alter significantly the amount of a control protein, BRCA1, in both the soluble and insoluble fractions. These results indicate that 53BP1 is bound to chromatin after X-irradiation of cells. 53BP1 has been shown to be phosphorylated in asynchronous cultures and becomes hyperphosphorylated after IR treatment of cells (14Anderson L. Henderson C. Adachi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1719-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 15Rappold I. Iwabuchi K. Date T. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 16Xia Z. Morales J.C. Dunphy W.G. Carpenter P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 2708-2718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine whether phosphorylation was necessary for 53BP1 to bind to chromatin, we treated cell lysates from X-irradiated cells with phosphatase. Phosphatase treatment released 53BP1 from the insoluble fraction into the soluble fraction (Fig. 1B). This treatment also converted the slower migrating phosphorylated forms of BRCA1 to the faster migrating form, indicating that the enzyme was active. Thus, phosphorylation was necessary for 53BP1 to bind to chromatin in cells treated with x-ray. In contrast to x-ray treatment, neither UV nor HU treatment resulted in reduction of the soluble 53BP1 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that 53BP1 binding to chromatin was specifically correlated with induction of DSBs. To ask whether the 53BP1 chromatin binding activity was correlated with the formation of IR-induced 53BP1 foci, we carried out a time-course experiment after X-irradiation. When MCF7 cells were irradiated with 2 Gy, the reduction of soluble 53BP1 was observed at the earliest time point measured (30 min after irradiation), reached a maximum level at 4 h, and decreased at 15 h after irradiation (Fig. 1D, top panel, soluble fractions). Importantly, hyperphosphorylated forms of 53BP1, which migrate slower in SDS-polyacrylamide gel, were not present in the soluble fraction after treatment of cells with x-ray. In a parallel experiment, appearance of hyperphosphorylated forms of 53BP1 was monitored by 53BP1 immunoblotting with whole cell extracts prepared by lysing cells with 2% SDS-PBS buffer. Hyperphosphorylated forms of 53BP1 were observed at the same time course as that of the reduction of soluble 53BP1 in X-irradiated cells (Fig. 1D, top panel, soluble fractions and whole cell extracts). These data indicate that hyperphosphorylated forms of 53BP1 were bound to chromatin. 53BP1 foci were evident at 30 min, with nearly all nuclei displaying foci, and declined in number from 12 to 27 h (Fig. 1D, bottom panel). The time point (15 h) when 53BP1 was released from chromatin coincided with the time point of extensive 53BP1 focus dispersion. Collectively, these results show that the focus-formation, phosphorylation and chromatin binding of 53BP1 are different manifestations of the same cellular response specifically activated by DNA DSBs. To determine whether 53BP1 was bound to chromatin at sites of IR-induced 53BP1 foci, we adapted a protocol for in situ detergent extraction of attached cells (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 2). In non-irradiated cells, 53BP1 showed diffuse nuclear staining with the exception of the nucleoli that were not stained. Some cells showed a bright large nuclear dot as well as diffuse nuclear staining as reported previously (14Anderson L. Henderson C. Adachi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1719-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, 53BP1 was lost from the nuclei of non-irradiated cells after extraction with Nonidet P-40. Whereas, 53BP1 localized at the foci in x-ray irradiated cells was still retained in the foci after the detergent extraction (Fig. 2). These data indicate that 53BP1 is loosely tethered and readily extracted from the nucleus by permeabilization in non-irradiated cells, and that, upon IR treatment, 53BP1 binds to chromatin and forms extraction-resistant foci at sites of DSBs. Identification of the Minimal Focus-forming Domain of 53BP1—To identify the region of 53BP1 required for focus formation, we ectopically expressed a series of HA-tagged 53BP1-deletion mutants in MCF7 cells (Fig. 3A). Cells were subjected to immunofluoresence staining with anti-HA antibody before or after X-irradiation. All mutants except NLS53BP1-N, the N-terminal half of 53BP1 fused to a 53BP1-NLS, were localized in the nucleus before irradiation (data not shown). The signals from the NLS53BP1-N mutant were seen in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (data not shown). After irradiation, all mutants that contained residues 1052 to 1709 showed focus formation (Fig. 3B), indicating that this region was sufficient for 53BP1 focus formation. This region was named 53BP1-CΔBRCT. Recently, it was reported that the mouse 53BP1 homologue localizes at the kinetochore during mitosis (28Jullien D. Vagnarelli P. Earnshaw W.C. Adachi Y. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 71-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetochore-binding domain (KBD) mapped to residues 1235 to 1616 of human 53BP1 (human KBD) and we noted that this domain lies within the 53BP1 focus-forming fragment (53BP1-CΔBRCT) (Fig. 4A). To aid in the identification of specific focus-forming domains within human KBD, we searched the protein sequence data base, using iterative PSI-BLAST (29Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A.

Intriguingly, these searches indicated that KBD contains “Tudor” and “My"

Recent studies show that Akt also regulates metabolic pathways to regulate cell survival. In this study, we reported that cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (Cdk5) regulates Akt activity and cell survival through the neuregulin-mediated PI 3-kinase signaling pathway. We found that brain extracts of Cdk5–/–mice display a lower PI 3-kinase activity and phosphorylation of Akt compared with that in wild type mice. Moreover, we demonstrated that Cdk5 phosphorylated Ser-1176 in the neuregulin receptor ErbB2 and phosphorylated Thr-871 and Ser-1120 in the ErbB3 receptor. We identified the Ser-1120 sequence RSRSPR in ErbB3 as a novel phosphorylation consensus sequence of Cdk5. Finally, we found that Cdk5 activity is involved in neuregulin-induced Akt activity and neuregulin-mediated neuronal survival. These findings suggest that Cdk5 may exert a key role in promoting neuronal survival by regulating Akt activity through the neuregulin/PI 3-kinase signaling pathway.

Cdk5 kinase activity requires association with its neuron-specific activators, p35 and p39. Cdk5 kinase activity is essential for neuronal migration, neurite outgrowth, and laminar configuration of the cerebral cortex (2Lew J. Huang Q.Q. Qi Z. Winkfein R.J. Aebersold R. Hunt T. Wang J.H.

These studies indicate that Cdk5 is a multifunctional protein kinase in the central nervous system. Cdk5 has been implicated in both cell survival and programmed cell death in neuronal and nonneuronal systems (14Ahuja H.S. Zhu Y. Zakeri Z. Dev.

Recently, Cdk5 in association with p25, a truncated form of p35, has been thought to be deregulated to produce hyperphosphorylated tau protein and to disrupt the neuronal cytoskeleton, and it may be involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral secrosis, Parkinson's disease, and Niemann-Pick disease (18Patrick G.N.

Cdk5 knockout mice exhibit a unique phenotype with perinatal mortality, associated with extensively disrupted cerebral cortical layering due to abnormal neuronal migration, absence of cerebella foliation, and degeneration of neurons in the brain stem and the spinal cord (24Ohshima T. Ward M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G. Veeranna Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Martin L.J. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar, 25Ohshima T.

Ogawa M. Veeranna Hirasawa M. Longenecker G. Ishiguro K. Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Kulkarni A.B. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent studies on Cdk5 null mice expressing transgenic Cdk5, regulated by a p35 promoter to ensure specific expression in brain neurons (TgKO), were rescued and exhibited the wild type phenotype (29Tanaka T. Veeranna Ohshima T. Rajan P. Amin N.D. Cho A. Sreenath T. Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Kulkarn A.B. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 550-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that neuronal survival (and host survival) is dependent upon Cdk5 activity. In addition, our recent studies demonstrated that Cdk5 prevents neuronal apoptosis by negative regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 in cortical neurons (30Li B.S. Zhang L. Takahashi S. Ma W. Jaffe H. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that the role of Cdk5 activity in neuronal survival may depend on the specific cell type as well as its site of action in survival and/or apoptotic signal pathways. A clue as to other possible sites of Cdk5 activity in regulating neuronal survival is suggested by the observation that Cdk5 activity, mediated by the neuregulin/ErbB pathway, up-regulates acetylcholine receptor expression at the neuromuscular junction in embryonic myotubes and adult muscle (13Fu A.K. Fu W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W. Ip F.C. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The neuregulins (NRGs) are a class of epidermal growth factor-like molecules; a multigene family encodes them. All NRG proteins contain an extracellular epidermal growth factor-like domain, which is essential for their function (31Adlkofer K. Lai C.

The NRG-1/neuregulin family includes heregulin, acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity, neu differentiation factor, and glial growth factor (36Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 37Meyer D. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 378: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Neuregulin proteins mediate their action through the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, including ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4 (36Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 38Gassmann M. Lemke G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). NRG receptors differ in kinase activity and substrate selectivity. Each ErbB protein has an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, a short intracellular juxtamembrane region, a tyrosine kinase domain, and a protein-rich carboxyl-terminal tail (36Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). NRG-1 binds to ErbB3 and induces the formation of heterodimers between ErbB2 and ErbB3 and thus activates the receptor (36Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Targeted disruptions of the NRG-1 gene as well as the neuregulin receptors demonstrate that neuregulins are essential for the formation of the heart and nervous system (39Lin W. Sanchez H.B.

Klein R. Lemke G. Nature. 1995; 378: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Neuregulins have been implicated in a number of events in cell survival, mitosis, migration, and differentiation (41Dong Z. Brennan A. Liu N. Yarden Y. Lefkowitz G. Mirsky R. Jessen K.R.

Cell. 1994; 77: 349-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The survival of Schwann cells, for example, is mediated by neuregulin signaling through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, a critical survival pathway in neurons and in most cell types (45Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4936) Google Scholar). Accordingly, it seemed possible that an alternative site for Cdk5 regulation of neuronal cell survival might be the neuregulin-mediated PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. To explore this possibility, we took advantage of the Cdk5 null mouse, which exhibited no Cdk5 activity (24Ohshima T. Ward M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G. Veeranna Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Martin L.J. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), and examined the activities of PI3K and Akt. In this study, we report that Cdk5 regulates Akt activity through phosphorylation of the neuregulin receptors (ErbB2/ErbB3) and regulation of PI3K/Akt kinase signaling pathways. We found that brain extracts and cortical neurons from Cdk5 knockout mice exhibited reduced PI3K/Akt activities and increased apoptosis. The Ser-1120 residue in the RSRSPR sequence in the ErbB3 receptor is a novel Cdk5 consensus sequence. Here we see that Cdk5 activity sustains neuronal survival by activating a survival-signaling pathway, upstream at the receptor itself. Cell Culture—Cortical neurons from embryonic day 16.5 and 18 Cdk5 wild type and knockout mice (Cdk5–/–) were prepared as described by Li et al. (30Li B.S. Zhang L. Takahashi S. Ma W. Jaffe H. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In brief, embryos were dissected and minced well with scissors. The dissociated cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in a serum-free neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 and 0.5 mm l-glutamine. Cells (25 × 104) were plated in 35-mm plastic dishes precoated with polylysine (10 μg/ml) (Gibco) for 7 days. HEK-293T and COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum. Preparation of Brain Extracts—Brain of E18.5 from Cdk5–/– and wild type mice were rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and homogenized in a buffer containing 0.32 m sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and protease inhibitor mixture using poltroon. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was analyzed for in vitro phosphorylation and PI3K activity. Phospholipid Extraction—Equal aliquots of 50 μl (1 μg/μl) of supernatant from Cdk5–/– and wild type mice brain (E18) were phosphorylated as described by Li et al. (30Li B.S. Zhang L. Takahashi S. Ma W. Jaffe H. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In brief, the samples were incubated in 15 μCi of [32P]ATP in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol for 2 h at 30 °C with constant mixing. The reactions were stopped by the addition of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Following vigorous overtaxing, tubes were spun at 3000 rpm for 10 min. the organic phase containing phospholipids was collected, and a 0.8-ml mixture of chloroform/methanol/H2O (3:48:47) was added to the organic phase vortexes and spun for 10 min at 3000 rpm. The aqueous phase was discarded completely, and the organic phase was used to analyze the 32P incorporation into the lipids. The extracted phospholipids were quantified by liquid scintillation. PI3K Assay—Brain tissue from Cdk5–/– and wild type mice (E18) was homogenized in a buffer containing Nonidet P-40 (1%), 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates (200 μg of total protein) were immunoprecipitated with anti-p85 subunit antibody. The precipitates were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 μm Na3VO4). The activity of PI3K was assayed essentially as described by Hii et al. (73Hii C.S. Moghadammi N. Dunbar A. Ferrante A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27246-27255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of MgCl2 (stock concentration of 100 mm), 10 μl of PtdIns (stock concentration of 1 μg), and 5 μl of 400 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, were added to the 50-μl precipitates, and the reaction was started by the addition of 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 10 min with constant mixing. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 40 μl of 8 n HCl and 320 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). After vigorous mixing and centrifugation, the lipid phase was collected and washed with 500 ml of CH3OH/H2O (1:1). The inositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositols were separated by TLC using CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/30% NH4OH (90:70:14.6:5.4, v/v/v/v) developing mixture. Phosphorylated phospholipids were detected by autoradiography. Phosphorylation Studies—P7 rat brain extracts were prepared, and Cdk5 was immunoprecipitated using anti-Cdk5 antibody as described by Li et al. (30Li B.S. Zhang L. Takahashi S. Ma W. Jaffe H. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The peptides were synthesized commercially (Peptide Technologies Inc.). For in vitro phosphorylation studies, we incubated peptides or histone H1 with the Cdk5 immunoprecipitate (IP). An Akt IP was used to phosphorylate H2B to determine Akt activity. Substrates (peptides or H2B) were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (0.1 mm) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) with 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm microcystin LR, and immunoprecipitated Cdk5 or Akt for 30 min at room temperature as described by Li et al. (30Li B.S. Zhang L. Takahashi S. Ma W. Jaffe H. Kulkarni A.B. Pant H.C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To study the phosphorylation of ErbB-specific sites by Cdk5, the mutant and wild type C-terminal domain (residues 663–1339) of rat ErbB3 plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE. HA-tagged ErbB3 wild type and mutant (T871A and S1120A) C-terminal domains (residues 663–1339) of the receptor were generated by standard cloning methods. The putative phosphorylation sites in ErbB3 were mutated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Western Blot Analysis—Brain tissues or cells were homogenized in a buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). Proteins were resolved by 10–20% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Applied Science); blocked in 5% skim milk, 1× PBS, 0.05% Tween 20; and probed with primary antibodies. Anti-Cdk5 polyclonal antibody, anti-ErbB3 polyclonal antibody (C-17) or anti-ErbB3 monoclonal antibody (G-4) (C-8; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-Ser-473 and Thr-308 Akt, or anti-total Akt was used for Western blot analysis using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's procedures. Apoptosis Assays—DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis was detected by TUNEL histochemistry staining. Cortical neurons with or without inhibitor treatment were directly mounted on cover slides and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (20 min at room temperature and then incubated for nick end-labeling for 2 h at 37 °C with TdT according to standard procedures (Roche Applied Science). Immunofluorescence—Cortical neurons or brain sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed in several changes of PBS for 30 min, and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Monoclonal or polyclonal anti-Cdk5 antibody (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal antibody ErbB3 (C-17; Santa Cruz), and phospho-Akt (Thr308) (1:200; New England Biolabs) was incubated overnight at 4 °C. After a wash in PBS (three times for 15 min each), Cells or sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG or rhodamine-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody for1hat room temperature. Fluorescent images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM-410 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Images were processed and merged using Adobe PhotoShop software. Mass Spectrometry—Peptides were phosphorylated using nonradioactive ATP as described above. Phosphorylation of the peptides was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectra on a Voyager-DE STR Biospectrometry Work station (Applied Biosystems) operating in the negative linear mode. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix was utilized. Reduced Brain Lipid Phosphorylation and PI3K Activity in Cdk5–/– Mouse Brain—Previous studies have shown that neuronal Cdk5 activity is necessary for survival and nervous system development (29Tanaka T.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6758-6771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phospholipid kinases, the phosphoinositide kinases, are responsible for the phospholipid phosphorylation. Among three general families, PI3K selectively phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and produces phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) upon stimulation by a variety of ligands in vivo as well as in vitro (47Stephens L. Eguinoa A. Corey S. Jackson T. Hawkins P.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2265-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is a key molecule involved in cell growth and survival signaling (48Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). To determine the identity of this fraction, phospholipids were extracted from wild type and Cdk5–/– mouse brain extracts after in vitro phosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data presented in Fig. 1A show a 6-fold decrease in γ-32P incorporation into the phospholipids in brain extracts of Cdk5–/– as compared with wild type mice. In the absence of Cdk5, the synthesis of phospholipids is compromised. In order to explore the possibility of Cdk5-mediated interaction with the phospholipid-dependent PI3K signaling pathway, we compared PI3K activity in the cortical neurons derived from wild type and Cdk5–/– mice. The cortical neurons of Cdk5–/– mice showed a significantly decreased PI3K activity (Fig. 1B). Akt Phosphorylation and Activity Is Decreased in Cdk5–/– Mouse Brain—Since Akt phosphorylation on both Thr-308 and Ser-473 by 3′-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1) is dependent on the levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, the key product of PI3K activity and PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels (49Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we compared the Akt phosphorylation and activity levels in cortical extracts of E18-wild type and Cdk5–/– mice (Fig. 2, A and B). The total Akt and phosphorylated Akt expression levels were determined by Western blot analysis with specific anti-phospho-Akt (Thr-308 or Ser-473) and anti-total Akt antibodies. Akt kinase activity was assessed using IPs from brain extracts obtained with total Akt antibody and histone H2B as a substrate. We found that expression levels of Akt protein of wild type and Cdk5–/– mice were similar (Fig. 2C). However, the phosphorylation of Akt and its activity were significantly decreased in the Cdk5–/– mice compared with wild type mouse brain extracts (Fig. 2, C and D). Although the Akt activity was reduced to low levels in Cdk5–/– mice brain extracts, the corresponding Akt phosphorylation was not reduced proportionally (Fig. 2, C and D). This may be due to some cross-reactively of phospho-Akt antibodies used in these experiments. In the absence of any Cdk5 activity in Cdk5–/– mice, the PI3K/Akt kinases are down-regulated, suggesting that their activities are dependent upon Cdk5 phosphorylation. Neuregulin Receptor ErbB3 and ErbB2 Are Phosphorylated by Cdk5—The above observations suggest that Cdk5 activity is involved in the PI3K signaling pathway. To determine the target substrate for Cdk5, we based our analysis on the observation that the Cdk5-p35 complex is implicated in neuregulin-induced acetylcholine receptor expression at the neuromuscular junction (13Fu A.K. Fu W.Y. Cheung J. Tsim K.W. Ip F.C. Wang J.H. Ip N.Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This suggested that ErbB receptors might be a substrate for Cdk5 phosphorylation. Indeed, we found that the putative Cdk5 phosphorylation consensus sequence motifs are present in the ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptor molecules. Ser-1176 in the sequence SPGK of ErbB2, Thr-871 in the TPIK sequence, and Ser-1204 in the SPPR sequence of ErbB3 are putative phosphorylation sites in Cdk5 consensus motifs. To test whether these and other proline-directed serine residues in the peptides derived from ErbB2 and ErbB3 (see Fig. 3A) are the sites phosphorylated by Cdk5, we incubated these peptides and their mutant forms with Cdk5 IP from brain extracts and determined their phosphorylation by in vitro kinase assays. We found that Cdk5 significantly phosphorylated the Ser-1176 in the ErbB2 peptide RPKTLSPGKN and Thr-871 in the ErbB3 peptide AKTPIKWAL but weakly phosphorylated Ser-1204 in the ErbB3 proline-rich peptide RRGSPPRPPR (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, we found that the Ser-1120 in the basic amino acid-rich sequence RSRSRSPRPR of ErbB3 was the most favorable substrate for Cdk5 (Fig. 3C). The peptide RSRSRSPRPR does not have the conventional consensus sequence ((K/R)(S/T)PX(K/R), where X represents a basic residue) of cyclin-dependent kinase including Cdk5, but it is rich in basic amino acids and appears to be a novel Cdk5 phosphorylation consensus sequence. To confirm whether Cdk5 phosphorylates the Ser-1120 residue, we conducted in vitro kinase assays using various mutant peptides derived from RSRSRSPRPR in which alanines were substituted for serines (Fig. 3, B and D). Ser-1120 appeared to be the site for Cdk5 phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of Thr-871 of RPKTLSPGKN in ErbB2 and Ser-1120 of RSRSRSPRPR in ErbB3 were further investigated and confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3, E and F). To investigate the Cdk5 phosphorylation of ErbB3 in vivo, the Thr-871 and Ser-1120 in the C-terminal domain of rat ErbB3 were mutated to Ala (T871A and S1120A). COS-7 cells were cotransfected with wild t"
https://openalex.org/W2005824211,"The hyperthermophilic Archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus metabolizes glucose by a non-phosphorylative variant of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. In this pathway glucose dehydrogenase and gluconate dehydratase catalyze the oxidation of glucose to gluconate and the subsequent dehydration of gluconate to 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate. 2-Keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG) aldolase then catalyzes the cleavage of 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate to glyceraldehyde and pyruvate. The gene encoding glucose dehydrogenase has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli to give a fully active enzyme, with properties indistinguishable from the enzyme purified from S. solfataricus cells. Kinetic analysis revealed the enzyme to have a high catalytic efficiency for both glucose and galactose. KDG aldolase from S. solfataricus has previously been cloned and expressed in E. coli. In the current work its stereoselectivity was investigated by aldol condensation reactions between d-glyceraldehyde and pyruvate; this revealed the enzyme to have an unexpected lack of facial selectivity, yielding approximately equal quantities of 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate and 2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate. The KDG aldolase-catalyzed cleavage reaction was also investigated, and a comparable catalytic efficiency was observed with both compounds. Our evidence suggests that the same enzymes are responsible for the catabolism of both glucose and galactose in this Archaeon. The physiological and evolutionary implications of this observation are discussed in terms of catalytic and metabolic promiscuity.

Our evidence suggests that the same enzymes are responsible for the catabolism of both glucose and galactose in this Archaeon. The physiological and evolutionary implications of this observation are discussed in terms of catalytic and metabolic promiscuity. The hyperthermophilic Archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus grows optimally at 80–85 °C and pH 2–4, utilizing a wide range of carbon and energy sources (1Grogan D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6710-6719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has become one of the most comprehensively researched model organisms of archaeal metabolism and bioenergetics (2Schafer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1277: 163-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Central metabolism in this organism involves a modified Entner-Doudoroff pathway (3De Rosa M. Gambaccorta A. Nicolaus B. Giardina P. Poerio E. Buonocore V. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), production of acetyl-CoA by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (4Kerscher L. Nowitzki S. Oesterhelt D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and the citric acid cycle coupled to oxidative phosphorylation (5Danson M.J. Black S.C. Woodland D.L. Wood P.A. FEBS Lett. 1985; 179: 120-124Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The modified Entner-Doudoroff pathway is a non-phosphorylative variant of the classic pathway and proceeds with no net production of ATP (Fig. 1). An analogous pathway has also been detected in the thermoacidophilic Archaea Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (6Selig M. Xavier K.B. Santos H. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), Thermoplasma acidophilum (7Budgen N. Danson M.J. FEBS Lett. 1986; 196: 207-210Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and Thermoproteus tenax (8Siebers B. Hensel R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 111: 1-8Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as well as strains of Aspergillus fungi (9Elzainy T.A. Hassan M.M. Allam A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 114: 457-459Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Elshafei A.M. Acta Biotechnol. 1989; 9: 485-489Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The first reaction of the non-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway involves the NAD(P)-dependent oxidation of glucose to gluconate, catalyzed by glucose dehydrogenase. Gluconate is then dehydrated by gluconate dehydratase to 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate (KDG), 1The abbreviations used are: KDG, 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate; KDGal, 2-keto-3-deoxygalactonate; KDPG, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate; KDPGal, 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogalactonate; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. which undergoes an aldolate cleavage to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde, catalyzed by KDG aldolase. Glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase then oxidizes glyceraldehyde to glycerate, which is phosphorylated by glycerate kinase to give 2-phosphoglycerate. A second molecule of pyruvate is produced from this by the actions of enolase and pyruvate kinase. Glucose dehydrogenase has previously been purified to homogeneity from cell extracts of S. solfataricus (11Giardina P. De Biasi M.-G. De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Buonocore V. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It was shown to have broad substrate specificity, which implied a possible function in the oxidation of other sugars. The same enzyme was found to be responsible for galactose dehydrogenase activity in the extracts, and it was suggested that the enzymes of the non-phosphorylative Entner-Doudoroff pathway might be used for the metabolism of both glucose and galactose (11Giardina P. De Biasi M.-G. De Rosa M. Gambacorta A. Buonocore V. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This possibility was investigated in the current work by in vitro studies of glucose dehydrogenase and KDG aldolase. The successful cloning and expression of the KDG aldolase gene has been reported previously (12Buchanan C.L. Connaris H. Danson M.J. Reeve C.D. Hough D.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and we now report the cloning and expression of the glucose dehydrogenase gene and kinetic analysis of both enzymes. Materials—Matrex gel Red A affinity medium was purchased from Millipore Ltd., Watford, UK, and the Cibacron blue F3GA dye affinity column was from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hemel Hempstead, UK. Matrix 60 silica gel for flash chromatography was from Fluorogen Ltd., Glossop, UK, l-Glyceraldehyde was from Acros, Loughborough, UK, and all other chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd., Poole, UK. S. solfataricus (DSM 1616) cell paste was provided by Dr. Neil Raven (Centre for Applied Microbiological Research, Porton Down, UK), and the expression vector pREC7/NdeI was provided by Dr. L. C. Kurz (Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). General Procedures—Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using a calibration curve constructed with bovine serum albumin. Polarimetry was carried out using an AA-10 automatic polarimeter (Optical Activity Ltd., Huntingdon, UK). NMR analysis was performed on an Avance 300 machine (Bruker, Coventry, UK). HPLC analysis was performed using a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H Organic Analysis column (300 mm × 7.8 mm) linked to an RID-10A refractive index detector (Shimadzu, Milton Keynes, UK). Samples were eluted in 8 mm H2SO4 at a flow rate of 0.55 ml·min–1, and the system was calibrated with pyruvate, glyceraldehyde, d-KDG and 2-keto-3-deoxy-d-galactonate (d-KDGal). Enzyme activities were monitored spectrophotometrically using a Lambda Bio 230V machine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Beaconsfield, UK) or a Cary 300 Bio machine (Varian Ltd., Walton-on-Thames, UK). Preparation of S. solfataricus Cell Extracts—Cell paste was resuspended at ∼0.2 g/ml in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 5.5, containing 20 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were broken at 4 °C by four 30-s bursts of sonication, using a 150-watt Ultrasonic Disintegrator (MSE Scientific Instruments, Crawley, UK). Soluble cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Purification and N-terminal Sequencing of Glucose Dehydrogenase— Glucose dehydrogenase was purified from soluble cell extracts by gel filtration using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (0.32 × 60 cm) (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, containing 20 mm MgCl2. Pooled fractions were then applied to a Cibacron blue F3GA affinity chromatography column and eluted with buffer containing 50 mm xylose and 0.5 mm NADP+. The pooled fractions containing glucose dehydrogenase activity were subjected to SDS-PAGE (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), and the entire gel was washed for 2 h in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The gel was then submerged in an activity-staining solution, containing 0.65 mm NADP+, 0.4 mm nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.07 mm phenazine methosulfate, and 100 mm glucose in 40 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. It was incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 15–20 min or until a blue-brown band appeared. The resulting stained band was cut out of the gel, ground in 20 μl of loading buffer and subjected to further analysis by SDS-PAGE. The band corresponding to glucose dehydrogenase activity was electroblotted onto a hydrophobic polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and the N-terminal sequence was determined using a 470 gas-phase sequencer, coupled to a 120 phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Glucose Dehydrogenase Gene Cloning and Sequencing—Degenerate PCR primers were designed based on each end of the N-terminal amino acid sequence obtained from the purified glucose dehydrogenase. PCR amplification, using S. solfataricus genomic DNA as template, yielded a 72-bp product which was radiolabeled using a High Prime DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science, Lewes, UK). The radiolabeled PCR product was used as a hybridization probe to screen a S. solfataricus genomic DNA library in lambda phage (15Connaris H. West S.M. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Screening was carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and a secondary screen was performed on initial positives. Lambda DNA was purified using the Wizard® Lambda Preps DNA Purification System (Promega, Southampton, UK), and DNA sequencing was carried out using the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method (17Sanger F. Nicklem S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) on a 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Glucose Dehydrogenase—The glucose dehydrogenase gene was amplified from the S. solfataricus lambda library using gene-specific primers to introduce a unique NdeI site upstream of the initiating methionine codon and a unique BamHI site downstream of the termination codon. The PCR product was cloned into these sites of the pREC7 expression vector and used to transform Escherichia coli strain JM109 (Promega). One-liter cultures were grown in LB media containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C to A 600nm = 0.6, before induction with nalidixic acid (50 μg/ml) and further incubation for 21 h. Cells were harvested at 2000 × g for 10 min and resuspended at ∼0.2 g/ml in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 5.5, containing 20 mm MgCl2. Cells were lysed by addition of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and lysozyme (100 μg/ml). After1hof incubation at 37 °C, followed by five 30-s bursts of sonication at 4 °C, cell debris was removed by centrifugation. The resulting extract was heated at 80 °C for 30 min, and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation. The extract was further purified by a Matrex gel Red A column (2 × 30 cm) using the MES buffer with a 0–1.5 m NaCl elution gradient. Glucose Dehydrogenase Assay—Glucose dehydrogenase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by following the increase in absorbance at 340 nm, corresponding to the reduction of NADP+, over 1 min at 70 °C. The standard assay mixture (1 ml) contained 0.5 mm NADP+, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mm MgCl2 in 100 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5 at 70 °C). Enzyme kinetic analysis was performed with 10 mm NAD+ or 1 mm NADP+ at various concentrations of glucose or galactose. Kinetic parameters were determined by the direct linear method of Eisenthal and Cornish-Bowden (18Eisenthal R. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant KDG Aldolase—S. solfataricus KDG aldolase was expressed using the pET-3a expression vector (Novagen, Nottingham, UK) with the gene cloned into the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. One-liter cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen) containing the vector were grown overnight at 37 °C without induction. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended at ∼0.2 g/ml in water. They were lysed by two passes through a cell disruptor (One-shot model, Constant Systems, Warwick, UK) at 200 MPa before heat precipitation at 95 °C for 30 min. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting KDG aldolase sample was lyophilized. Synthesis and Analysis of d-Glyceraldehyde— d-Glyceraldehyde was synthesized by periodate cleavage of 1,2–5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-d-mannitol (19Hirth G. Walther W. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1985; 68: 1863-1871Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The sample was purified by silica gel flash chromatography in dichloromethane:methanol (9:1) and analyzed by HPLC and 1H NMR spectroscopy. Its enantiomeric purity was confirmed by polarimetry and derivatization with l-(–)-α-methylbenzylamine in a procedure modified from that used by Oshima and Kumanotani (20Oshima R. Kumanotani J. Chem. Lett. 1981; : 943-946Crossref Google Scholar). 25 mg of d-glyceraldehyde in 0.5 ml of H2O was mixed with an equal volume of methanol containing 67.5 mg of l-(–)-α-methylbenzylamine and 10 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride. The mixture was allowed to stand overnight before being evaporated to dryness and subjected to 1H NMR spectroscopic analysis in deuterated methanol. Samples of dl-glyceraldehyde and l-glyceraldehyde were analyzed in a similar way. KDG Aldolase-catalyzed Condensation between d-Glyceraldehyde and Pyruvate—Approximately 1 g of d-glyceraldehyde was mixed with 2.2 g of sodium pyruvate (2-fold molar excess) in 100 ml of water containing 5 mg of lyophilized S. solfataricus KDG aldolase. The reaction was heated at 50 °C in a shaking incubator, and regular samples were taken over 9 h. 500-μl samples were added to 100 μl of 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged before HPLC analysis. The remaining reaction mix was lyophilized, and the diastereomers were separated by Dowex 1X8-formate anion exchange chromatography, using a 0–0.6 m formic acid elution gradient. Diastereomers were identified by NMR analysis of the methyl ester by comparison to literature spectra (21Fong S. Machajewski T.D. Mak C.C. Wong C.-H. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 22Plantier-Royon R. Cardona F. Anker D. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1991; 10: 787-811Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Separated samples of d-KDG and d-KDGal were dried over P2O5 before analysis by polarimetry and HPLC. Coupled Assay for S. solfataricus KDG Aldolase—A continuous assay was developed to assay S. solfataricus KDG aldolase in the cleavage direction using the l-lactic dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus as a coupling enzyme (23Nobbs T.J. Cortes A. Gelp J.L. Holbrook J.J. Atkinson T. Scawen M.D. Nicholls D.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 60 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 5 mm fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and 0.2 mm NADH. Various concentrations of d-KDG or d-KDGal were added from 1 m stock solutions, and rates were monitored by a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Appropriate controls were performed to ensure the requirements for coupled enzymatic analysis were met (24Tipton K.F. Eisenthal R. Danson M.J. Enzyme Assays: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002: 32-37Google Scholar), and kinetic parameters were determined by the direct linear method (18Eisenthal R. Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem. J. 1974; 139: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Glucose Dehydrogenase from S. solfataricus—Glucose dehydrogenase was purified from cell extracts of S. solfataricus and its Km for glucose with NADP+ was found to be 1.20 (±0.02) mm. One major protein species was responsible for the activity and the M r was found to be ∼41,000 by preparative SDS-PAGE. N-terminal sequencing was successfully carried out on this protein and determined to be MKAIIVKPPNAGVQVKDVDEKEPE. A DNA probe corresponding to this sequence was generated by PCR amplification and, after radiolabeling, was used to identify the full gene sequence from a genomic DNA library in lambda phage. The gene was found to encode a polypeptide of 366 amino acids with a predicted M r of 40,849. The nucleotide sequence data were deposited in the GenBank™ sequence data base in October 1998 under the accession number AJ012093 and are annotated in Fig. 2. In addition to the open reading frame a TATA box, TTTATA, was found 28–33 nucleotides upstream of the start codon, followed by a putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence 6–14 nucleotides upstream. T-rich polypyrimidine termination sequences, as described by Reiter et al. (25Reiter W.-D. Hudepohl U. Zillig W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), were found 21–26 and 35–41 bp downstream of the stop codon. Characterization of Recombinant Glucose Dehydrogenase— The recombinant enzyme was successfully expressed in E. coli with a specific activity of 2 units/mg in cell extracts. It was purified to homogeneity by heat precipitation and Matrex gel Red A affinity chromatography, as assessed by SDS-PAGE. Calibrated gel filtration of the purified enzyme was consistent with a tetrameric structure with M r of ∼160,000. The enzyme was found to have activity with a number of alternative sugar substrates and to possess dual cofactor specificity, as listed in Table I. These features are shared with the glucose dehydrogenase from the related thermoacidophile T. acidophilum (26Smith L.D. Budgen N. Bungard S.J. Danson M.J. Hough D.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 261: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and the enzyme from other archaeal sources (27Siebers B. Wendisch V.F. Hensel R. Arch.

Barton J.D. Rossjohn J. Thorn J.M. Taylor G.L. Ollis D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These enzymes are characterized by a chain length of 350–375 residues and conserved structural zinc-binding and nucleotide-binding sites. They possess a characteristic GXGXXG/A fingerprint motif (30Wierenga R.K. De Maeyer M.C.H. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1346-1357Crossref Scopus (465) Google Scholar) in the classic αβαβαβ nucleotide-binding fold (31Rao S.T. Rossman M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In T. acidophilum glucose dehydrogenase the dual cofactor specificity has been rationalized by the presence of asparagine and histidine residues at positions 215 and 217, in conjunction with a GXGXXA motif (32John J. Crennell S.J. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1996; 2: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The enzyme from S. solfataricus was found to have a GXGXXG motif from residues 188–193 and a structurally equivalent asparagine residue at position 211 (Fig. 2). Arg-213 is likely to take the place of His-217, allowing stabilization of the adenosine 2-phosphate of NADP. These features provide a plausible structural explanation for the observed dual cofactor specificity of the S. solfataricus enzyme. S. solfataricus glucose dehydrogenase was found to possess four conserved cysteine residues at positions 93, 96, 99, and 107, which are equivalent to the residues involved in the coordinate binding of a zinc atom in the T. acidophilum enzyme (32John J. Crennell S.J. Hough D.W. Danson M.J. Taylor G.L. Structure. 1996; 2: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found to possess the catalytic zinc-binding residues Cys-39 and His-66, which align well with highly conserved Cys and His residues present throughout the whole alcohol dehydrogenase family (33Jornvall H. Persson B. Jeffery J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In support of this mechanism, activity in the standard assay was reduced by 60% in the presence of 10 mm EDTA, although there was no significant increase in the presence of ZnCl2, CaCl2, or MgCl2, at final concentrations of 0.1 mm. As listed in Table I, the glucose dehydrogenase from S. solfataricus has activity with a number of alternative aldose sugars. Activity was found with d-galactose, the C4 epimer of d-glucose, although not with d-allose or d-mannose, the C3 and C2 epimers. Activity was also observed with d-xylose, an aldopentose sugar with identical configuration to glucose at C2, C3, and C4. Good activity was observed with its C4 epimer l-arabinose but not with its C3 or C2 epimers d-ribose or d-xylose. It therefore appears that the enzyme has a preference for the glucose-specific stereo-configuration at C2 and C3 but accepts either configuration at C4. The C2 derivatives d-glucosamine and 2-deoxy-d-glucose showed very little activity, which may indicate an interaction with the enzyme at this position. The fact that aldopentoses serve as substrates and that 6-deoxy-d-glucose has activity, shows the diminished importance of the configuration at C5 and C6. d-Fucose, the 6-deoxy derivative of d-galactose also had activity, which again confirms that the enzyme can accept either configuration at the C4 position. Because of the potential metabolic significance of a dual activity with d-glucose and d-galactose, discussed later, the enzyme was subjected to further kinetic analysis with both substrates and the determined parameters are listed in Table II. Although the maximum rate with d-glucose is higher than the value for d-galactose, the lower observed Km with the latter gives it a higher catalytic efficiency. The Km value for d-glucose with NADP+ was found to be 1.30 (±0.05) mm, which is close to that observed for the enzyme purified from S. solfataricus cells.Table IIKinetic parameters of glucose dehydrogenase from S. solfataricus at 70 °CSubstrateCofactorKmVmaxkcatk cat/Kmmmunits/mgs-1s-1 mm-1d-GlucoseNAD+1.50 (±0.05)110 (±5)74.949.9NADP+1.30 (±0.05)70 (±2)47.736.7d-GalactoseNAD+0.57 (±0.01)90 (±1)61.3107.5NADP+0.44 (±0.01)55 (±1)37.485.1 Open table in a new tab Synthesis of d-Glyceraldehyde—Problems were encountered establishing a reliable commercial source of d-glyceraldehyde, and it was therefore synthesized as required by the periodate cleavage of 1,2–5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-d-mannitol. This reaction affords two molecules of isopropylidene-d-glyceraldehyde, which is converted to d-glyceraldehyde by treatment with H2SO4. Product was shown to be free from contaminants by HPLC and 1H NMR spectroscopy, and its enantiomeric purity was assessed by polarimetry. The determined optical rotation, [α]D25=+9.75∘ (c = 2, H2O), was well within the reported range of +7° to +14° (34Baer E. Fischer H.O.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1939; 61: 761-765Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The enantiomeric purity was further confirmed by derivatization with l-(–)-α-methylbenzylamine, which yielded diastereometrically pure (S,S)-3-(1-phenylethylamine)propane-1,2-diol, as assessed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. This was compared with the other diastereomer obtained in an equivalent reaction with l-glyceraldehyde. KDG Aldolase Selectivity— d-Glyceraldehyde samples were used in an aldol condensation reaction with pyruvate, catalyzed by recombinant S. solfataricus KDG aldolase. The reaction progress was monitored by calibrated HPLC analysis as shown on the graph in Fig. 3A. Unexpectedly, the condensation resulted in the presence of two diastereometric products, indicating a lack of facial selectivity in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction. These two product peaks are clearly visible on HPLC traces, throughout the time course of the reaction (Fig. 3B). The diastereometric products, d-KDG and d-KDGal, were separated by anion exchange chromatography, and their identity was confirmed by NMR analysis of the methyl ester (21Fong S. Machajewski T.D. Mak C.C. Wong C.-H. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Polarimetry was carried out on the separated products and revealed the expected specific rotation for d-KDG (35Plantier-Royon R. Anker D. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1991; 10: 239-249Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and d-KDGal (36Kuhn R. Weiser D. Fischer H. Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1959; 628: 207-239Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). d-KDG: [α]D25=-34.6∘ (c = 1.3, H2O), Lit. [α]D25=-33.1∘ (c = 1.3, H2O). d-KDGal: [α]D25=+7.0∘ (c = 2, H2O), Lit. [α]D25=+7.9∘ (c = 1.65, H2O). In an equivalent experiment with racemic glyceraldehyde, the separated diastereomers did not give the expected specific rotations for single enantiomer products. This is due to the formation of KDG and KDGal as mixtures of enantiomers. In reactions between l-glyceraldehyde and pyruvate there was a similar lack of facial selectivity as observed for d-glyceraldehyde, revealed by two peaks in HPLC analysis (data not shown). In this case the enzyme is catalyzing the formation of diastereomers l-KDG and l-KDGal. In all cases the results clearly show there is little facial selectivity in the enzyme-catalyzed aldol condensation. KDG Aldolase Kinetics—Purified d-KDG and d-KDGal were used for enzyme kinetic analysis in the aldolate cleavage direction using a coupled assay with the l-lactic dehydrogenase from Bacillus stearothermophilus. The determined kinetic parameters are listed inTable III. The lower activity with d-KDGal is partially compensated by its lower observed Km , which increases the catalytic efficiency. The Km for d-KDG of 25.7 (±1.2) mm is high compared with the values of 1.0 (±0.1) mm for pyruvate and 3.9 (±0.3) mm for d-glyceraldehyde (12Buchanan C.L. Connaris H. Danson M.J. Reeve C.D. Hough D.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the existence of KDG and KDGal in pyranose and furanose ring forms (22Plantier-Royon R. Cardona F. Anker D. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1991; 10: 787-811Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) may have implications for in vitro studies of the aldolase-catalyzed reaction, which must operate via the straight-chain form of the sugar.Table IIIKinetic parameters of KDG aldolase from S. solfataricus at 60 °CSubstrateKmVmaxkcatk cat/Kmmmunits/mgs-1s-1mm-1d-KDG25.7 (±1.2)51.4 (±2.5)28.21.1d-KDGal9.9 (±0.4)12.3 (±0.4)6.80.7 Open table in a new tab The cloning of the glucose dehydrogenase gene through N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the enzyme purified from S. solfataricus provides a valuable confirmation of the enzyme identity.

Little is known, however, about the combined effects of the pre- and postnatal environments on cognitive function of adult offspring and structural alterations in the adult brain. In this study, we confirmed that pre- or postnatal stress impaired learning and memory performance of rats. Conversely, pre- or postnatal enriched housing improved behavioral performance. These experience-dependent behavioral alterations were consistent with changes in 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-labeled cell number in the granule cell layer of the hippocampus and in the expression level of synaptic markers such as neuronal cell adhesion molecule and synaptophysin, and expression of a neurotrophic factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Postnatal stress appeared to have no influence on cell proliferation, however. We did find that postnatal environment could attenuate prenatal effects partly via a longitudinal cross-housing study, in which pups born to mothers housed under enriched conditions were reared under stressful conditions and vice versa. These results suggest that postnatal environmental manipulations can counteract the cognitive alterations in early adulthood and the structural changes in the young adult brain induced by prenatal experience."
https://openalex.org/W2120921814,"Recent studies indicate a key role of aquaporin (AQP) 4 in astrocyte swelling and brain edema and suggest that AQP4 inhibition may be a new therapeutic way for reducing cerebral water accumulation. To understand the physiological role of AQP4-mediated astroglial swelling, we used 21-nucleotide small interfering RNA duplexes (siRNA) to specifically suppress AQP4 expression in astrocyte primary cultures. Semiquantitative RT-PCR experiments and Western blot analysis showed that AQP4 silencing determined a progressive and parallel reduction in AQP4 mRNA and protein. AQP4 gene suppression determined the appearance of a new morphological cell phenotype associated with a strong reduction in cell growth. Water transport measurements showed that the rate of shrinkage of AQP4 knockdown astrocytes was one-half of that of controls. Finally, cDNA microarray analysis revealed that the gene expression pattern perturbed by AQP4 gene silencing concerned ischemia-related genes, such as GLUT1 and hexokinase. Taken together, these results indicate that 1) AQP4 seems to be the major factor responsible for the fast water transport of cultured astrocytes; 2) as in skeletal muscle, AQP4 is a protein involved in cell plasticity; 3) AQP4 alteration may be a primary factor in ischemia-induced cerebral edema; and 4) RNA interference could be a new potent tool for studying AQP pathophysiology in those organs and tissues where they are expressed."

Only recently has understanding of the cellular processes underlying the ability of the skeleton to remodel (i.e. to serve Wolff's Law) made possible a search for the specific mechanisms by which mechanical force is translated into alterations in bone structure. Studying cellular response to mechanical strain in vitro, we have previously shown that murine osteoprogenitor cells respond to the application of strain by decreasing the expression of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) 1The abbreviations used are: RANKL, receptor activator of nuclear κB ligand; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; eNOS, endothelial NOS; iNOS, inflammatory NOS; nNOS, neuronal NOS; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; JNKi, JNK inhibitor; ERKi, ERK inhibitor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MOI, multiplicity of infection; l-NAME, N ω–nitro-l-arginine methyl ester. mRNA (13Rubin J.

Since the diminished expression of RANKL by bone cells is inextricably linked to a repression of osteoclast formation, we wondered whether other “proformative” events might be associated with signals initiated by mechanical factors. In this work, we show that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is regulated by strain in a divergent fashion; strain induces the expression of eNOS at the same time that this mechanical input decreases expression of RANKL. eNOS, which generates nitric oxide (NO), appears to promote an anabolic picture in bone (24Koyama A.

Rheumatol. 1997; 36: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). NO has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on both osteoclast formation and activation (26Collin-Osdoby P. Rothe L.

Immunology. 2001; 103: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We will show in this work that induction of eNOS expression, similarly to mechanical regulation of RANKL, also requires activation of ERK1/2 kinase. To confirm the role of ERK1/2 in these mechanically controlled events, we utilize an adenovirus causing constitutive ERK1/2 activity and show both that eNOS is up-regulated and that RANKL is down-regulated in the presence of an activated MAPK signaling system. Materials and Reagents—Antibodies to total ERK1/2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and those to phosphorylated ERK1/2 were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 was obtained from Calbiochem, as was the JNK inhibitor (JNKi; SP600125). Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Other chemicals and supplies were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—To generate primary stromal cell cultures, murine marrow cells collected from the tibiae and femurs of 3–5-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were plated in 6-well plates at 1.6 × 106 cells/cm2 as previously published (17Rubin J. Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). After 60 min, nonadherent cells containing the stromal elements were transferred to Bioflex collagen I-coated plates (Flexcell Corp., McKeesport, PA) in α-minimal essential medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. The next day nonadherent cells were discarded; adherent stromal cells were cultured with 10 nm 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D added to stimulate RANKL expression on day 4. Strain regimens were applied on day 6. For experiments where lysates were made for Western analyses, inhibitors were added 30 min prior to strain, and the experiment was stopped as indicated. When the end point was to measure mRNA species, total mRNA was isolated 24 h after beginning strain induction. Application of Mechanical Strain—Uniform equibiaxial mechanical strain was generated using a Flexcell Bioflex instrument (Flexcell Corp., McKeesport, PA) as previously described (13Rubin J. Murphy T. Nanes M.S. Fan X. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C1126-C1132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain magnitudes were as noted from 0.25 to 2%, with strain frequency fixed at 10 cycles/min (0.17 Hz). Similar plates containing control cultures were kept in the same incubator but were not subjected to strain regimens. Measurement of NO—A fluorometric assay was used to measure nitrite in samples using the reagent 2,3-diaminonaphthalene with comparison with a NaNO2 standard curve (0–10 μm) as described previously (31Misko T.P. Schilling R.J. Salvemini D. Moore W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 32Kleinhenz D. Fan X. Rubin J. Hart C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μl of standards and samples were added to microtiter 96-well plates (DYNEX Technologies, Inc.) and mixed with 10 μl of fresh 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (prepared in 0.62 m HCl) for 10 min at room temperature. The reactions were terminated with 5 μl of 2.8 n NaOH. Formation of the 2,3-diaminonaphthotriazole end product was measured using an LB 50 plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 440 nm. All standards and samples were measured in triplicate. Western Blot Analysis—For NOS expression, proteins were extracted from stromal cells in boiling lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Cell lysates were boiled for an additional 5 min and passed three times through a 26-gauge needle. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min to remove insoluble material, protein concentrations in the supernatant were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit. Samples containing 200 μg of total protein were electrophoresed through a 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were immersed in blocking buffer containing TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C. The eNOS and inflammatory NOS (iNOS) isoforms were identified using respective polyclonal antibodies (1:1000; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); membranes were washed three times with TBST and then incubated with second antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:1500). The proteins were detected by ECL plus chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Real Time PCR to Assess mRNA Species—Analysis of eNOS, RANKL, and 18 S mRNA was performed as in Refs. 17Rubin J.

Briefly, reverse transcription of 0.5 μg of total RNA treated with DNase I was performed with random decamers (Ambion, Austin, TX) and superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). For real time PCR, amplification reactions were performed in 25 μl containing primers at 0.5 μm and dNTPs (0.2 mm each) in PCR buffer and 0.03 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) along with SYBR-green (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at 1:150,000. Aliquots of cDNA were diluted 10–10,000-fold for 18 S and 5–625-fold for eNOS, iNOS, and RANKL to generate relative standard curves with which sample cDNA was compared (34Johnson M.R. Wang K. Smith J.B. Heslin M.J. Diasio R.B. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). For eNOS, forward and reverse primers were 5′-AAC CAG CGT CCT GCA AAC C-3′ and 5′-CAA TGT GAG TCC GAA AAT GTC C-3′, respectively, creating an amplicon of 133 bp. For iNOS, forward primer 5′-GCA TGG ACC AGT ATA AGG CAA GCA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GCT TCT GGT CGA TGT CAT GAG CAA-3′ amplified a 222-base pair amplicon (35Riancho J.A. Salas E. Zarrabeitia M.T.

Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar. Standards and samples were run in triplicate. Dilution curves showed that PCR efficiency was more than 90% for all species including 18 S. Adenovirus Preparation—The adenovirus carrying the constitutively activated mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) (Ad.caMEK) was generated in our laboratory beginning with the pMCL-MKK1 plasmid carrying the caMEK sequence generously provided by Dr. Natalie Ahn (University of Colorado). As published (36Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar), the MEK was constitutively activated by removal of the coding sequence for amino acids 32–51 and alteration of the nucleotides encoding two serine regulatory sites at 218 and 221 to glutamic and aspartic acid, respectively. The caMEK sequence was removed with XbaI and HindIII and inserted into the pShuttle vector as per the Stratagene protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The pShuttle now carrying the caMEK sequence was linearized with PmeI and co-transformed with pAdEasy in recA-proficient bacteria. Small kanamycin resistant colonies were selected and digested with PacI. After confirmation of appropriate band patterns, the viral DNA was used to transform recA-deficient bacteria. Colonies containing the desired gene as analyzed by PCR were selected, and the DNA was linearized with PacI and purified before calcium phosphate transfection of HEK293 cells. After transduction, HEK293 cell layers were overlaid with agarose and assessed for viral plaque formation at 10 days. Viruses were eluted from plaques and amplified in HEK293 cells; infected cells were subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles, and the supernatants were collected for use in experiments. For virus applications, viral lysates were added with 10 μg/ml LipofectAMINE in serum-free medium at the indicated MOIs, with an equal volume of media containing 20% fetal bovine serum added at 5 h. Cellular responses were studied at 24 h. Assessment of MAPKs—Western blotting for MAPK phosphorylation was performed as detailed in Ref. 17Rubin J. Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar. Briefly, the supernatants of cell lysates were concentrated, and 10 μg of protein was chromatographed and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Primary and secondary antibody incubation was followed by measurement of chemiluminescence (ECL-plus; Amersham Biosciences). Assessment of JNK and ERK Activation—To visualize the ability of the Ad.caMEK to activate ERK1/2, we utilized Western analysis to see the 42- and 44-kDa phosphorylated bands as in Ref. 17Rubin J. Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar. To assess c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) activity, a c-Jun phosphorylation assay was utilized as previously; briefly, soluble cell lysates in cold Triton lysis buffer with proteinase inhibitors were incubated with 2.5 μg of agarose-bound glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun-(1–79) (Calbiochem) in a total volume of 400 μl of Triton lysis buffer overnight at 4 °C on rotating platform (17Rubin J. Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 37Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 332: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Washed agarose beads were mixed with 100 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphoproteins were separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel, and phosphorylated glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun-(1–79) was visualized at ∼37 kDa. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by Dunnett or Bonferroni's post hoc one-way analysis of variance (GraphPad Prism). Mechanical Strain Induces eNOS Expression in Murine Stromal Cells—Bone cells express multiple forms of NOS, with eNOS being the most prominent isoform. iNOS and neuronal NOS (nNOS) have both been described in bone during growth and fracture healing but are clearly present in lower amounts than eNOS in bone cells themselves (38Helfrich M.H. Evans D.E. Grabowski P.S. Pollock J.S. Ohshima H. Ralston S.H. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 39MacPherson H. Noble B.S. Ralston S.H. Bone. 1999; 24: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Using Western blotting to identify species in C57BL/6 murine stromal cells, we were able to identify eNOS protein in samples where 200 μg of lysate protein was loaded. To assess whether the NOS might be residing in the membrane component, we also separated membrane protein and found that similar loading of 200 μg of membrane protein did not alter the amount of eNOS reacting with the antibody. In cells exposed to 2% magnitude mechanical strain overnight, eNOS increased, as shown in a representative blot (Fig. 1a). iNOS was not visible in Western blots from these lysates, despite successful blotting of an assay positive control for the iNOS species. Because of sensitivity in assessing amounts of eNOS protein, we confirmed the strain inductive response using a sensitive real time PCR assay for eNOS mRNA. This assay was designed to recognize only eNOS, and not iNOS or nNOS, on the basis of primer specificity. In Fig. 1b, compiled from three separate experiments where cells were exposed to 24 h of 2% strain, eNOS mRNA significantly increased by more than 2-fold. Using primers specific for murine iNOS, we demonstrated a lack of response to strain of this NOS isoform; we performed real time PCR on control and cells strained for 24 h. Grouped real time PCR data from three experiments showed no significant difference in levels of iNOS mRNA between control (100 ± 10%) and strained cells (90 ± 25%). These data ruled out a contribution from iNOS to the strain-induced increase in nitric oxide described below. Gene Expression Is Differentially Sensitive to Strain Magnitude—The response of eNOS was in the opposite direction to the strain-induced decrease in RANKL gene expression, which we had explored previously (17Rubin J. Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To understand better the differences in mechanical regulation of these two genes, eNOS and RANKL, we performed a series of experiments where strain magnitude was varied. Our current strain instrumentation allowed application of uniform strain as low as 0.25%, and we studied four different strain regimens up to 2% magnitude. At least three separate experiments were performed at each strain magnitude and compiled in Fig. 2. For each sample, eNOS, RANKL, and 18 S were amplified from samples subjected to reverse transcription with random decamers as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data was expressed as percentage of target control mRNA compared with 18 S in the sample. eNOS mRNA responded to 0.25% strain, rising to 120%, and continued to increase, reaching a plateau at 161 ± 28% compared with eNOS mRNA measured in unstrained cells (p < 0.001), a rise comparable with the previous series shown in Fig. 1b. RANKL also responded to application of 0.25% strain, reaching a nadir by 1% strain, as shown in Fig. 2. This result can be compared with previous results where strains less than or equal to 1% were not effective when dosed for only 6 h (17Rubin J. Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In the experiments presented here, application of strain for 24 h allowed us to generate reproducible mechanical effects on both eNOS and RANKL gene expression with strains significantly lower than 1%. Results showing that strain caused a divergent response of these two genes at all magnitudes studied suggested that mechanical regulation of eNOS and RANKL share a proximal signaling pathway. NO Release Is Stimulated by Strain and Reflects Increases in eNOS—We next measured nitric oxide production from murine cells during strain. NO did not rise immediately, in contrast to the immediate activation in response to fluid shear in cellular NOS of both osteocytes and osteoblasts (40Klein-Nulend J. Helfrich M.H. Sterck J.G. MacPherson H. Joldersma M. Ralston S.H. Semeins C.M. Burger E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 41Smalt R. Mitchell F.T. Howard R.L. Chambers T.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 433: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Even at 60 min, as measured by a more sensitive assay (31Misko T.P. Schilling R.J. Salvemini D. Moore W.M. Currie M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 214: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 32Kleinhenz D. Fan X. Rubin J. Hart C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 856-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) than used in the latter studies, NO was not significantly different from that secreted into media by unstrained cell cultures (Fig. 3a). However, NO was significantly increased by 2-fold after 24 h of strain, as shown in Fig. 3b. Furthermore, the strain induction of NO required the activity of endogenous NOS, as the competitive inhibitor, l-NAME, blocked the effect of strain on NO production, shown in Fig. 3c. Because iNOS was not affected by the strain protocol (see Fig. 1c), we inferred that the increased NO resulted from increased gene and protein expression of the endothelial form of NOS. Inhibition of ERK Activation Indicates That ERK Has Primary Effects on Both eNOS and RANKL—We had previously shown that straining cells at magnitudes less than 2% caused activation of both ERK1/2 and JNK (17Rubin J. Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Here we set out to prove that strain induction of eNOS expression is blocked by inhibition of ERK1/2 activation. The effect of overnight strain in this series of five experiments was to increase eNOS expression to 195 ± 26% of the unstrained control, as expected (Fig. 4a). Treatment with ERKi during the strain protocol prevented any strain-induced increase in eNOS as shown in the second gray bar in Fig. 4a, which shows an insignificant difference between the unstrained and strained cultures in the presence of ERKi. Exposure of unstrained controls overnight to an efficacious concentration of ERK inhibitor (ERKi) unexpectedly increased eNOS expression to 136 ± 8% of unstrained control levels, suggesting that basal ERK1/2 activity operates some regulatory control over eNOS expression in bone cells. However, when ERK1/2 was inhibited, application of strain failed to cause further increases in eNOS mRNA levels. The effect of strain on control cells in this series of experiments was to diminish RANKL expression to 58 ± 4% of control (Fig. 4b). The strain inhibition was ablated in cultures where ERK1/2 activation was blocked by treatment with ERKi; RANKL expression was not significantly different from that in unstrained cells treated with ERKi. However, as shown in Fig. 4, when primary stromal cultures were exposed to the ERKi for 16 h, RANKL expression increased significantly to 144 ± 25% of that of control stromal cells. Compared with our previous experiments, ERKi applied for only 6 h during the straining protocol was shown to prevent strain-induced decrements in RANKL mRNA expression but did not affect basal RANKL expression (17Rubin J. Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). That a longer exposure to ERKi raised RANKL mRNA expression suggests that RANKL expression is affected by ERK1/2 even in the absence of mechanical input, indicating that ERK activation may tonically limit RANKL expression. In sum, inhibition of ERK activation blocks strain effects on both eNOS and RANKL. We showed, in Fig. 3b, that NO did not rise until 24 h later, and this rise was preceded by an increase in eNOS expression and protein. Since nitric-oxide synthase is known to be activated acutely by strain (40Klein-Nulend J. Helfrich M.H. Sterck J.G. MacPherson H. Joldersma M. Ralston S.H. Semeins C.M. Burger E.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and Jessop et al. (42Jessop H.L. Rawlinson S.C. Pitsillides A.A. Lanyon L.E. Bone. 2002; 31: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) have suggested that of the activation of ERK1/2 in osteoblast-like cells may be dependent on immediate NO production, we considered whether ERK1/2 activation required rapid NO generation during strain. Cells were cultured overnight with l-NAME and then subjected to strain regimen for 10 min. ERK1/2 activation was measured as shown in Fig. 4c. Strain activation of ERK1/2 was not altered in cells where endogenous NO production was prevented by the competitive inhibitor, l-NAME. This indicated that NO does not have an acute role in strain activation of ERK1/2. Constitutive Activation of MEK Reproduces the Strain Effect on Both Genes—To further understand the relationship between ERK activation and its divergent regulation of eNOS and RANKL, we generated an adenovirus to deliver a constitutively activated MEK to cells. The use of adenovirus to transfer the gene was necessitated because these primary stromal cells are not very susceptible to infection by retro- and adeno-associated viruses as well as to liposo"

Increasing experimental evidence argues for the involvement of autocrine PRL in this process. PRL receptor antagonists have been developed to counteract these undesired proliferative actions of PRL. However, all forms of PRL receptor antagonists obtained to date exhibit partial agonism, preventing their therapeutic use as full antagonists. In the present study, we describe the development of new human PRL antagonists devoid of agonistic properties and therefore able to act as pure antagonists. This was demonstrated using several in vitro bioassays, including highly sensitive assays able to detect extremely low levels of receptor activation. These new compounds also act as pure antagonists in vivo, as assessed by analyzing their ability to competitively inhibit PRL-triggered signaling cascades in various target tissues (liver, mammary gland, and prostate). Finally, by using transgenic mice expressing PRL specifically in the prostate, which exhibit constitutively activated signaling cascades paralleling hyperplasia, we show that these new PRL analogs are able to completely revert PRL-activated events. These second generation human PRL antagonists are good candidates to be used as inhibitors of growth-promoting actions of PRL.

These investigations have been performed to better understand the increasing body of evidence that PRL is able to promote tumor growth of some of its target tissues, as has been recognized for a long time with respect to mammary tumors in rodents (for reviews see Refs. 1Clevenger C.V. Furth P.A. Hankinson S.E. Schuler L.A. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar and 2Wennbo H. Tornell J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1072-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As an illustration of this, it was recently shown that the appearance of genetically induced mammary tumors in mice is delayed in PRL-deficient mice (3Vomachka A.J. Pratt S.L. Lockefeer J.A. Horseman N.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1077-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas PRL transgenic mice spontaneously develop mammary neoplasia (4Wennbo H. Gebre-Medhin M. Gritli-Linde A. Ohlsson C. Isaksson O.G. Tornell J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2744-2751Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In contrast, the involvement of PRL in human breast tumors has always been controversial, primarily because no strong correlation between the circulating levels of PRL and the risk to develop breast cancer could ever be established, except for more recent studies (5Wang D.Y. De Stavola B.L. Bulbrook R.D. Allen D.S. Kwa H.G. Fentiman I.S. Hayward J.L. Millis R.R. Int. J. Epidemiol. 1992; 21: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Kabuto M. Akiba S.

Prev. 1994; 18: 79-85PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the lack of any clinical improvement of breast cancer patients treated with dopamine agonists (which lower circulating levels of PRL) rapidly reduced the interest of oncologists with respect to a potential role of PRL in the development of breast cancer (8Anderson E. Ferguson J.E. Morten H. Shalet S.M. Robinson E.L. Howell A. Eur. J. Cancer. 1993; 29: 209-217Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Bonneterre J. Mauriac L. Weber B. Roche H. Fargeot P.

Harvey H.A. Lipton A. Simmonds M.A. Bartholomew M. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1989; 14: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A number of recent observations argues strongly that the role of PRL in the progression of breast cancers (and maybe of other cancers) needs to be reconsidered. First, at the epidemiological level, the largest study ever performed (Nurse Health study) clearly shows a positive correlation between high normal PRL levels and the risk of breast cancer in post-menopausal women (11Hankinson S.E. Willett W.C. Michaud D.S. Manson J.E. Colditz G.A. Longcope C. Rosner B. Speizer F.E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1999; 91: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Second, and even more important is the discovery that PRL is expressed by many extra-pituitary sites, including mammary epithelial cells, and that this locally produced hormone stimulates cell proliferation via an autocrine-paracrine loop in many species, including humans (see Refs. 12Ginsburg E. Vonderhaar B.K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2591-2595PubMed Google Scholar, 13Clevenger C.V. Chang W.P. Ngo W. Pasha T.M. Montone K.T. Tomaszewski J.E. Am. J.

Third, the PRL receptor (PRLR) is expressed in virtually all mammary epithelial cells, and its level of expression, at least at the RNA level, is in general higher in tumors compared with the adjacent normal tissue, arguing for an increased sensitivity of tumor cells to the hormone (17Touraine P. Martini J.F. Zafrani B. Durand J.C. Labaille F. Malet C. Nicolas A. Trivin C. Postel-Vinay M.C. Kuttenn F. Kelly P.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Morel G. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 79: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Fourth, recent observations show that PRL activates the expression of various proteins known to be key players in breast cancer progression, such as cyclin D1 (20Brockman J.L. Schroeder M.D. Schuler L.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 774-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 21Yu Q. Geng Y. Sicinski P. Nature. 2001; 411: 1017-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar), or insulin-like growth factor-2, recently identified as a putative relay of some PRL actions in the breast (22Brisken C.

Belfiore A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2471-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The only anti-PRL drug currently available for clinical use is a family of dopamine agonists, the prototype of which is bromocriptine. Like dopamine, these compounds efficiently inhibit PRL synthesis and release from its major source of production, the pituitary. However, because extrapituitary PRL production is regulated by mechanisms and molecules still unknown, but clearly different compared with those acting in the pituitary (24Baudhuin A. Manfroid I. Van De W.C. Martial J.A. Muller M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 454-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), dopamine agonists are unable to block PRL secretion from extrapituitary tissues. The increasing evidence that locally produced, maybe even more than pituitary-produced, PRL might play a key role in promoting tumor growth encouraged the search for alternative strategies to counteract this proliferative effect. One such approach is the development of specific PRLR antagonists. The closely related growth hormone (GH) receptor along with the PRLR were recognized as the initial members of the hematopoietic cytokine receptor superfamily, the cDNAs of which were cloned 15 years ago (25Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 26Goffin V. Kelly P.A. J. Mamm. Gland. Biol. Neopl. 1997; 2: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The mechanism of ligand-induced activation of these receptors has been widely studied by us (27Goffin V. Shiverick K.T. Kelly P.A. Martial J.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 385-410PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kinet S. Bernichtein S. Llovera M. Kelly P.A. Martial J.A. Goffin V. Recent Res. Dev. Endocrinol. 2001; 2: 1-24Google Scholar) and others (29Wells J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The active form of PRL and GH receptors is a homodimer composed of two identical membrane chains, each of which interacts with opposing sides of the hormone, referred to as binding sites 1 and 2. Because these ligands bind first one receptor chain via their binding site 1, to form an inactive intermediate 1:1 complex, and then to a second receptor chain, to form an active 1:2 complex, the most classical strategy to develop PRL or GH antagonists has been based on the rational design of ligands with impaired binding site 2. The prototype of such mutations is the substitution of the conserved helix 3 glycine for larger side chain residues, such as arginine or tryptophan, which sterically hinder the binding site 2 (30Fuh G.

So-called G120R-hGH or G129R-hPRL analogs were found to be potent antagonists of their respective receptors in many in vitro bioassays (30Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V.

In human mammary tumor cell lines, the PRLR antagonist G129R-hPRL was also reported to induce apoptosis (35Chen W.Y. Ramamoorthy P. Chen N. Sticca R. Wagner T.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 3583-3593PubMed Google Scholar, 36Beck M.T. Peirce S.K. Chen W.Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5047-5055Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), to inhibit PRL activation of transcription factor STAT3 (37Cataldo L. Chen N.Y. Yuan Q. Li W. Ramamoorthy P. Wagner T.E. Sticca R.P. Chen W.Y. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 17: 1179-1185PubMed Google Scholar), and to reduce tumor growth in vivo (38Chen N.Y. Holle L. Li W. Peirce S.K. Beck M.T. Chen W.Y. Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 20: 813-818PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these encouraging reports arguing for the potential interest of G129R-hPRL as a potent inhibitor of PRL actions in the context of breast cancer, our recent observations clearly show that this PRL analog has its disadvantages, because it fails to antagonize PRL in many situations. Reminiscent to the problem encountered by many selective estrogen receptor modulators, G129R-hPRL exhibits some residual agonistic activity, which in some instances predominates over its antagonistic properties. We have recently shown, by comparing several in vitro bioassays, that the more sensitive the bioassay, the more pronounced is this residual agonism (39Bernichtein S. Jeay S. Vaudry R. Kelly P.A. Goffin V. Endocrine. 2003; 20: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because the mechanism of action of such PRLR antagonists is to compete with WT PRL for binding to the receptor, this implies that the antagonists must be used in molar excess, i.e. at concentrations at which the residual agonistic activities tend to predominate. This is clearly the case in transgenic mice, which express G129R-hPRL at concentrations 10–100-fold higher than endogenous PRL. 2S. Bernichtein, C. Kayser, J. J. Kopchick, P. A. Kelly, and V. Goffin, unpublished data.2S. Bernichtein, C. Kayser, J. J. Kopchick, P. A. Kelly, and V. Goffin, unpublished data. These mice fail to exhibit any of the phenotypes observed in PRLR knockout mice (40Ormandy C.J. Camus A. Barra J. Damotte D. Lucas B.K. Buteau H. Edery M. Brousse N. Babinet C. Binart N. Kelly P.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), such as female sterility and mammary gland failure, but instead exhibit certain phenotypes reminiscent of moderate hyperprolactinemia, such as constitutive MAPK activation in the prostate (see below). These and other observations clearly demonstrate that G129R-hPRL is not a final clinically usable product but requires further improvements. In the present study, we describe the development of pure PRLR antagonists, i.e. second generation compounds completely devoid of any residual agonistic activity in all in vitro bioassays used, including the most sensitive cell proliferation assays. We also provide evidence that these new PRL analogs are potent inhibitors of PRL actions in vivo, including the effects induced by locally produced hormone in transgenic mice expressing PRL only in the prostate. Reagents—Culture media, fetal calf serum, geneticin (G-418), trypsin, and glutamine were purchased from Invitrogen. Luciferin and cell lysis buffer were from Promega (Madison, WI), and luciferase activity was measured in relative light units (Lumat LB 9501, Berthold, Nashua, NH). IODO-GEN was purchased from Sigma, and carrier-free Na[125I] was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Salts were high grade purified chemicals purchased from Sigma or Merck. Oligonucleotides were from Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium). Bromocriptine was purchased from Sigma (catalog number B2134). Hormones—In this study, we used exclusively recombinant proteins as follows: WT hPRL (41Paris N. Rentier-Delrue F. Defontaine A. Goffin V. Lebrun J.J. Mercier L. Martial J.A. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1990; 12: 436-449PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular mimic of phosphorylated PRL named S179D-hPRL (42Bernichtein S. Kinet S. Jeay S. Madern M. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. Goffin V. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3950-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); the first generation antagonist G129R (Gly129 replaced with Arg) (31Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and the two new antagonists constructed in this study, Δ1–9-G129R-hPRL and Δ1–14-G129R-hPRL, characterized by the deletion of the 9 or 14 N-terminal residues, respectively. The pT7L expression vector used for expression of all hPRL analogs was described previously (41Paris N. Rentier-Delrue F. Defontaine A. Goffin V. Lebrun J.J. Mercier L. Martial J.A. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1990; 12: 436-449PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant WT and mutated hPRL were produced in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and purified as shown in our former publications (31Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Goffin V. Kinet S. Ferrag F. Binart N. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. J.

Briefly, protein purification was performed using ion exchange columns (Hi Trap Q-Sepharose) purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The hGH antagonist G120K-hGH (Gly120 replaced with Arg) was kindly provided by Sensus Drug Development Corp. (Austin, TX). Antibodies, RIA, ELISA—Antibodies used in this study are as follows: polyclonal anti-hPRL (A569, Dako), a monoclonal anti-active MAPK (directed against Thr202/Tyr204-phosphorylated MAP kinases 1 and 2, also referred to as anti-active Erk1/2; Cell Signaling, catalog number 9106), polyclonal anti-MAPK1/2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., catalog number 06-182), polyclonal anti-phosphorylated STAT5A/B (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., catalog number 06-867), polyclonal anti-STAT5 (C-17; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-phosphorylated STAT3 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., clone 9E12), and polyclonal anti-STAT3 (C-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Quantification of circulating hPRLs after hormone injections in mice was performed in serum using a radioimmunoassay (IRMA, Immunotech, France) or a human PRL-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Prolactin Elisa kit, Diagnostic Biochem Dbc. Canada Inc., Ontario, Canada) that we modified as described below. The absence of cross-reaction with endogenous murine PRL or transgenic rPRL was assessed using control sera of non-treated mice or purified hormones. Animals—Mice used in this study were WT Balb/c-J mice (Charles River Laboratories, l'Arbresle, France) or mice transgenic for rat PRL under the control of the probasin gene promoter, which directs specific expression of the transgene in the prostate (44Kindblom J. Dillner K. Sahlin L. Robertson F. Ormandy C. Tornell J. Wennbo H. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2269-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Non-transgenic littermates were used as controls when appropriate. Mice were housed and experimental protocols were in agreement with the procedures established by the local ethical committee. Software—All curves presented were analyzed and performed with GraphPad Prism version 3.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, www.graphpad.com). Autoradiographies (Western blot) were analyzed using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Construction of expression plasmids encoding Δ1–9-hPRL and Δ1–14-hPRL analogs was performed using PCR; plasmid pT7L-hPRL (41Paris N. Rentier-Delrue F. Defontaine A. Goffin V. Lebrun J.J. Mercier L. Martial J.A. Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 1990; 12: 436-449PubMed Google Scholar) was used as template. Sequences of 5′ oligonucleotides correspond to the 5′ sequence of the hPRL cDNA lacking the 9 (Δ1–9-hPRL) or 14 (Δ1–14-hPRL) N-terminal codons. A unique NdeI restriction site (CATATG) containing the ATG codon (methionine initiator) was inserted in the 5′ oligonucleotide, as follows: Δ1–9, GGCATATGCGATCCCAGGTGACCCTTCG; Δ1–14, GGCATATGCTTCGAGACCTGTTTGACC. The 3′ oligonucleotide was identical for both analogs; it corresponds to a sequence in the non-coding region of the hPRL cDNA, located 3′ of the unique HindIII restriction site: 5′-CTGTTACACCCACGCATGG-3′. The PCR was performed as follows: 200 μm dNTP, 45 μm MgCl2, 1.5 μl of Taq polymerase (5 units/μl), PCR buffer, 10 ng of template (plasmid pT7L-hPRL), 20 pmol of each primers. PCR was performed for 25 cycles: 94 °C (30 s), 56 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min). PCR products were subcloned into TA cloning vector (pCR II.1, Invitrogen), and then recombinant TA plasmids were digested using NdeI/HindIII restriction enzymes, and purified inserts were ligated into pT7L plasmid linearized at identical sites. After transformation, E. coli BL21(DE3) colonies were analyzed for their DNA content; plasmids were extracted and digested to confirm the presence of expected inserts and then sequenced to check the expected mutations. Expression plasmids encoding analogs Δ1–9-G129R-hPRL and Δ1–14-G129R-hPRL were constructed by substituting the EcoRI-BglII fragment from pT7L-G129R-hPRL plasmid (containing the G129R mutation) (31Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the corresponding EcoRI-BglII fragment in pT7L-Δ1–9-hPRL and pT7L-Δ1–14-hPRL expression vectors. Clones obtained were analyzed for the presence of the insert and then sequenced to check the expected mutations. Analog expression was performed using BL21(DE3) bacteria as described above. Biochemical Characterization of hPRL Analogs—The content of α-helical structure was calculated from circular dichroism spectra obtained as described previously (31Goffin V. Struman I. Mainfroid V. Kinet S. Martial J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32598-32606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Goffin V. Norman M. Martial J.A. Mol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26033-26043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass was estimated from the elution volume on gel filtration chromatography (Sephacryl S-100 or S-200 loaded into a C16/70 column; Amersham Biosciences) with respect to the elution volume of standard protein as described elsewhere (46Kinet S. Bernichtein S. Kelly P.A. Martial J.A. Goffin V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26033-26043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Binding affinities of hPRL analogs were determined using cell homogenates of HL5 cells (293 HEK cells stably expressing the human PRLR), following a procedure described previously (46Kinet S. Bernichtein S. Kelly P.A. Martial J.A. Goffin V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26033-26043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, hPRL was iodinated using IODO-GEN, and its specific activity was in the range of 40–50 μCi/μg. Binding assays were performed overnight at room temperature using 150–300 μg of cell homogenate protein in the presence of 30,000 cpm 125I-hPRL and increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor (WT or mutated hPRL). Results presented are representative of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate. The relative binding affinity of analogs was calculated as the ratio of their IC50 with respect to that of WT hPRL. Established Bioassays—PRL analogs were analyzed using four cell lines, following experimental procedures (media, stimulation time, etc.) detailed in our recent publication describing the two new homologous bioassays developed for human lactogens (39Bernichtein S. Jeay S. Vaudry R. Kelly P.A. Goffin V. Endocrine. 2003; 20: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Proliferation studies were performed using the reference assay for lactogens, Nb2 cells (47Tanaka T. Shiu R.P. Gout P.W. Beer C.T. Noble R.L. Friesen H.G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1980; 51: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 48Gout P.W. Beer C.T. Noble R.L. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 2433-2436PubMed Google Scholar), or the proliferation assay that we recently established using Ba/F-03 cells stably transfected with the expression plasmid encoding the human PRLR (referred to as Ba/F-LP cells). The transcriptional study was based on the activation of the lactogenic hormone-response element (LHRE)-luciferase reporter gene, performed using the HL5 clone as recently described (39Bernichtein S. Jeay S. Vaudry R. Kelly P.A. Goffin V. Endocrine. 2003; 20: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 42Bernichtein S. Kinet S. Jeay S. Madern M. Martial J.A. Kelly P.A. Goffin V.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26033-26043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Finally, we used T47D human breast cancer cell lines to assess signaling events triggered by the PRLR, using procedures described under “Signaling Studies” below. Mouse PRLR-mediated Transcriptional Bioassay—Prior to the analysis of the new antagonists in vivo, their ability to antagonize PRL-induced effects involving the mouse PRLR was tested in vitro. Similarly to the assay developed for the human PRLR (39Bernichtein S. Jeay S. Vaudry R. Kelly P.A. Goffin V. Endocrine. 2003; 20: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), 293 HEK cells were stably transfected using plasmids encoding the long isoform of mouse PRLR (49Ormandy C.J. Binart N. Helloco C. Kelly P.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the LHRE-luciferase reporter vector. One stable clone isolated by geneticin selection was selected for functional studies and referred to as ML-F5 (Mouse PRLR-Luciferase, clone F5). Experimental procedures are identical to those described previously (39Bernichtein S. Jeay S. Vaudry R. Kelly P.A. Goffin V. Endocrine. 2003; 20: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) for the same assay involving the human receptor. For all bioassays, agonistic properties of the various ligands were assessed by testing dose response of these hormones alone, and their potential antagonistic activity was tested by competing a fixed concentration of WT hPRL with increasing amounts of the putative antagonists, as indicated in the legends to figures. Signaling Studies—Signaling studies were performed using lysates of T47D cells or of mouse tissues harvested as described below. T47D cells were starved overnight in fetal calf serum-free medium before hormonal stimulation. Stimulations were performed as indicated in the figures. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS (34Llovera M. Pichard C. Bernichtein S. Jeay S. Touraine P. Kelly P.A. Goffin V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4695-4705Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), scraped, and centrifuged, and the pellet was kept frozen until used. Cells were solubilized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (30 min rotation at 4 °C; Ref. 34Llovera M. Pichard C. Bernichtein S. Jeay S. Touraine P. Kelly P.A. Goffin V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4695-4705Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and then the protein content of supernatants was measured by the Bradford assay. For STATs immunoprecipitation studies, 1–2 mg of protein lysates were incubated with polyclonal anti-STAT5 or anti-STAT3 (5 μl/ml). After overnight rotation at 4 °C, immune complexes were captured using 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 additional hour at 4 °C. Protein A complexes were precipitated by centrifugation, and pellets were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and boiled in 15 μl of reducing SDS sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. Finally, immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed using 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Analysis of MAPK activation was performed on total lysates of T47D cells using 50–100 μg of protein per lane on 10% SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) and membrane treatments were performed as described earlier (34Llovera M. Pichard C. Bernichtein S. Jeay S. Touraine P. Kelly P.A. Goffin V. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4695-4705Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies directed against phosphorylated STAT5"
https://openalex.org/W2003437932,"Activation of Ca2+ release channels/ryanodine receptors (RyR) by the inward Ca2+ current (I Ca) gives rise to Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), the amplifying Ca2+ signaling mechanism that triggers contraction of the heart. CICR, in theory, is a high-gain, self-regenerating process, but an unidentified mechanism stabilizes it in vivo. We reported previously (Lokuta, A. J., Meyers, M. B., Sander, P. R., Fishman, G. I., and Valdivia, H. H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 25333–25338) that sorcin, a 22-kDa Ca2+-binding protein, binds to cardiac RyRs with high affinity and completely inhibits channel activity. Here we show that sorcin significantly inhibits both the spontaneous activity of RyRs in quiescent cells (visualized as Ca2+ sparks) and the I Ca-triggered activity of RyRs that gives rise to [Ca2+] i transients. Because sorcin decreased the amplitude of the [Ca2+] i transient without affecting the amplitude or kinetics of I Ca, the overall effect of sorcin was to reduce the “gain” of excitation-contraction coupling. Immunocytochemical staining shows that sorcin localizes to the dyadic space of ventricular cardiac myocytes. Ca2+ induces conformational changes and promotes translocation of sorcin between soluble and membranous compartments, but the [Ca2+] required for the latter process (ED50 = ∼200 μm) appears to be reached only within the dyadic space. Rapid injection of 5 μm sorcin onto the cytosolic face of RyRs reconstituted in lipid bilayers resulted in complete inhibition of channel activity in ≤ 20 ms. Thus, sorcin is a potent inhibitor of both spontaneous and I Ca-triggered RyR activity and is kinetically capable of playing a role in terminating the positive feedback loop of CICR.

Thus, sorcin is a potent inhibitor of both spontaneous and I Ca-triggered RyR activity and is kinetically capable of playing a role in terminating the positive feedback loop of CICR. Sorcin, a fairly novel 22-kDa Ca2+-binding protein, is known to be present in cardiac myocytes (1Lokuta A.J. Meyers M.B. Sander P.R. Fishman G.I. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25333-25338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), but its function remains to be elucidated. Sorcin was first discovered in multidrug-resistant cells (2Meyers M.B. Biedler J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 99: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 3Biedler J.L.

Meyers et al. (4Meyers M.B. Pickel V.M. Sheu S.S. Sharma V.K. Scotto K.W. Fishman G.I. J. Biol.

These findings suggested a physical association between the two proteins, but the function of sorcin continued to be unresolved. Using [3H]ryanodine binding and direct recording of single RyR activity, Lokuta et al. (1Lokuta A.J. Meyers M.B. Sander P.R. Fishman G.I. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25333-25338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) revealed some functional relevance of the sorcin-RyR association by demonstrating that sorcin inhibited cardiac RyR (RyR2) activity. Interestingly, skeletal RyRs (RyR1) showed resistance to sorcin inhibition (1Lokuta A.J. Meyers M.B. Sander P.R. Fishman G.I. Valdivia H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25333-25338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These data substantiated a role for sorcin in RyR2 modulation, but questions regarding the role of sorcin in RyR2-initiated processes such as excitation-contraction (e-c) coupling and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) remained outstanding. The structural properties of sorcin make it a good candidate for having a potential role in these basic cellular processes. Sorcin belongs to the penta-EF-hand family of proteins (5Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Giangiacomo L. Colotti G. Pascarella S. Chiancone E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and binds Ca2+ with high affinity (Kd ,Ca ∼1 μm (6Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Vecchini P. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). At low [Ca2+], sorcin is readily soluble but exposes hydrophobic residues and tends to associate to membranes when [Ca2+] is high. It has been suggested that Ca2+ binding induces conformational changes in sorcin (7Mella M. Colotti G. Zamparelli C. Verzili D. Ilari A. Chiancone E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; PubMed Google Scholar), prompting it to translocate from cytosol to membrane-bound target proteins (5Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Giangiacomo L. Colotti G. Pascarella S. Chiancone E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Vecchini P. Chiancone E.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This Ca2+ dependence of sorcin could be advantageous in the setting of e-c coupling and CICR, where dynamic Ca2+ signaling occurs. E-C coupling and CICR in cardiac muscle are fairly well understood, but it is still unclear how these two processes achieve stability in intact cells. CICR is conceptually an explosive and self-perpetuating process, but an unidentified mechanism finely grades and interrupts Ca2+ release in vivo despite Ca2+ being high. Although several theories have been offered to explain the phenomenon of RyR closure in the presence of Ca2+, such as Ca2+-induced inactivation (9Fabiato A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 85: 247-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), stochastic attrition (10Stern M.D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 497-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), luminal Ca2+ depletion (11Terentyev D. Viatchenko-Karpinski S. Valdivia H.H. Escobar A.L. Gyorke S. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), or RyR adaptation (12Gyorke S. Fill M. Science. 1993; 260: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 13Valdivia H.H. Kaplan J.H. Ellis-Davies G.C. Lederer W.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1997-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), none has been convincingly demonstrated. A similar co-nundrum concerns Ca2+ release from RyRs at rest, visualized as Ca2+ sparks. Ca2+ spark frequency in cardiac myocytes increases after cell permeabilization (14Li Y. Kranias E.G. Mignery G.A. Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), suggesting that a cytosolic substance, which would be removed upon permeabilization, is acting to restrain RyR activity in the intact cell. This substance(s), if present, may also be responsible in whole or in part for interrupting Ca2+ release from activated RyRs during CICR. In this study, we explored the functional role of sorcin at several integrative levels of RyR2 function. By examining the Ca2+-dependent properties and kinetics of interaction with isolated RyRs, we determined that sorcin is capable of dynamic interaction with the RyR at a rate that would allow for sorcin modulation of the channel on a beat-to-beat basis. Using permeabilized and intact cardiac myocytes, we found that sorcin attenuates both Ca2+ sparks and Ca2+ transients, establishing the physiological significance of the effects of sorcin in vivo. Finally, we also explored the potential interaction of sorcin with dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), another key player in e-c coupling, and found that most of the cellular effects of sorcin may be explained by its predominant interaction with RyRs. Part of this work has been published in abstract form (15Farrell E.F. Antaramian A. Valdivia H.H. Biophys. J. 2003; 84 (abstr.): 17Google Scholar). Cloning and Expression of Sorcin—The human sorcin gene was obtained from ATCC (New York, NY) and amplified by PCR to introduce XhoI sites. The PCR product was subcloned into pGEX-5x-3 (Amersham Biosciences) using the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Sorcin was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (Promega, WI) and then purified in a glutathione-Sepharose column. Sorcin was eluted into PBS and aliquoted before storage at –80 °C. To avoid denaturation of sorcin, we avoided repetitive freeze-thaw cycles. Ventricular Cell Isolation and Calcium Spark Measurements— Mouse ventricular myocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of perfused mice hearts using the method of Mitra and Morad (16Mitra R. Morad M. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: H1056-H1060PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications addressed by Wolska and Solaro (17Wolska B.M. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H1250-H1255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized by peritoneal pentobarbital injection (50 mg/kg) before removal and hanging of the heart. Cells were suspended in Tyrode solution ((mm) 130 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 0.4 NaH2PO4, 0.5 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 25 HEPES, 22 glucose, 0.01 μg/ml insulin, pH 7.4, with NaOH) and kept at room temperature until used within 6 h. Isolated cardiac myocytes were permeabilized with saponin (0.01% for 45–60 s) in an internal solution containing (mm): 120 potassium aspartate, 3 MgATP (free [Mg2+] 1 mm), 10 phosphocreatine, 5 units ml–1 creatine phosphokinase, and 8% dextran, pH 7.2. For measurements of [Ca2+] sparks, myocytes were perfused with the internal solution described above with the addition of 0.03 pentapotassium Fluo-4 salt and 60 nm free Ca2+. All solutions were applied onto the cells with a microperfusion system that uses a three-barreled pipette (Warner Instruments). Sorcin concentration was 1 μm. Confocal images were acquired with a BioRad MR-1 confocal microscope coupled to a Nikon Diaphot microscope and a ×60 n.a. oil immersion objective. Images were recorded with the scan line oriented along the long axis of the cell at a speed of 2 ms/line, using the Lasersharp 2000 software. Fluo-4 was excited at 488 nm with an Ar ion laser, and emitted fluorescence was collected at >515 nm. Ca2+ sparks were measured with a computer program 2Modified by A. M. Gomez. running IDL software. All experiments were performed at room temperature (21–23 °C). Whole-cell Patch Clamping—Mouse cardiomyocytes were whole-cell patch clamped in an external solution (in mm, 140 NaCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 5 CsCl, 5.5 glucose, 5 HEPES, 1.8 CaCl2, pH 7.4). Patch pipette contained an internal solution (in mm, 130 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 NaH2PO4, 3.6 Na2PC, 5 MgATP, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.05 Fluo-3). Sorcin (3 μm) or PBS (control) was present as indicated. To allow for sorcin equilibration with the intracellular medium, all experiments were recorded 8 min after the whole-cell configuration was achieved. Cells were held at –80 mV prior to four sequential step-depolarizations to 0 mV to keep the SR load constant. To inhibit Na channels, cells were then ramped to –45 mV over 500 ms and then held at –45 mV for 100 ms before test pulses to between –50 and +60 mV in 10-mV increments. [Ca2+] i transients were visualized by exciting Fluo-3 at 488 nm, with emitted fluorescence at >515 nm, using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with a ×60, 1.2 n.a., water immersion objective. Transients were measured using IDL5.5 software (see above). L-type Ca2+ currents were recorded using pClamp7 software. Currents were normalized to the membrane capacitance to obtain current density. Cell Immunostaining—Adult mouse cardiomyocytes were enzymatically isolated as described above and incubated on laminin-coated (1:70 laminin:PBS) coverslips for at least3hat room temperature. Cells were then fixed on the coverslips with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min and subsequently washed in PBS. After 10–20 min, cells were permeabilized in a solution of 0.2% Triton (in 1× PBS) and 5% normal goat serum for 30 min. Anti-C-terminal sorcin antibody was diluted 1:2000 in the permeabilization solution listed above and incubated with the myocytes for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were exposed to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:400) (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature and again washed with PBS. Myocyte-containing coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using mounting solution (Molecular Probes). Control staining was done as described above with the exception that the anti-C-terminal sorcin antibody was preincubated with 4.2 μm of sorcin antigen (recombinant human sorcin protein) before application onto cells. Images were acquired using a Nikon Diaphot confocal microscope (BioRad MR-1) running on Lasersharp 2000 software. Confocal images are 0.25-μm sections. Deconvolution of images was kindly done by Enrico Stefani (University of California, Los Angeles) using the program Metamorph. Translocation of Endogenous Sorcin—Isolated mouse cardiomyocytes were suspended homogenously in Tyrode solution (see above) containing nominally free Ca2+ (3–5 μm). The cell suspension was aliquoted in Ependorff tubes and centrifuged for 2 min at 2,500 rpm. Supernatant was removed, and cell pellets were resuspended in a Tyrode solution containing 0.01% saponin (permeabilized cells only) and various [Ca2+] for ∼1 min. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant was again removed and the pellets resuspended in a nominally free Ca2+ Tyrode solution. Subsequently, cell resuspensions were filtered through glass fiber size C (GF-C) Whatman filters placed inside spin or vacuum (SV) miniprep filter holders that were fitted to a vacuum-suctioned DNA filtering system. The filters were removed and the protein extracted by overnight suspension of filters in Laemmli buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 400 mm dithiothreitol, 8% SDS, 0.04% bromphenol blue, in 50% glycerol). The protein suspension was then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-C-terminal sorcin antibody (Harlan Bioproducts for Science). Western Blots—Proteins from cell homogenates subjected to SDS-PAGE (as above) were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 2 h with Superblock blocking buffer in PBS (Pierce). Membranes were probed for 1 h with a polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of sorcin, diluted 1:5,000 in PBST (in mm, 3 KH2PO4, 10 Na2HPO4, 150 NaCl, pH 7.2–7.4, 0.1% Tween 20). After washing, membranes were incubated with secondary goat anti-rabbit antibodies (IgG) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem; 1:70,000 dilution in PBST). Protein-antibody reactions were detected by Super Signal chemiluminescent (Pierce) using Kodak X-Omat film. The relative amount of proteins on the blots was determined by densitometric analysis using the computer program LaserPix (BioRad). Exogenous sorcin was used as positive control. Fluorescence Measurements—The intrinsic fluorescence of sorcin was measured using a Hitachi Fluorometer F4500; fluorescence quenching was achieved by adding increasing amounts of CaCl2. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the fluorescence emission spectra were collected at 310–400 nm with a peak at 330 nm. The recombinant sorcin was in PBS and 1 mm EGTA. CaCl2 was added gradually from 500× stocks to yield the indicated free [Ca2+]. Single-channel Recording of RyRs and Fast Sorcin Steps—RyRs in SR vesicles were incorporated into planar lipid bilayers as described (13Valdivia H.H. Kaplan J.H. Ellis-Davies G.C. Lederer W.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1997-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 18Lokuta A.J. Rogers T.B. Lederer W.J. Valdivia H.H. J. Physiol. 1995; 487: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The trans (650 μl) and the cis (500 μl) chambers (corresponding to the luminal and cytoplasmic side of the channel, respectively) contained 300 mmol/liter CsCHSO3 (cesium methanesulfonate), 10 μm CaCl2, and 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2). A phospholipid bilayer of phosphatidylethaolamine:phosphatidylserine (1:1 dissolved in n-decane to 25 mg/ml) was “painted” with a glass rod across an aperture of ∼200-μm diameter in a delrin cup. The trans chamber was the voltage control side connected to the head stage of a 200A Axopatch amplifier, while the cis side was held at virtual ground. Signals were analyzed after filtering with an 8-pole Bessel filter at a sampling frequency of 1.5–2 kHz. Data acquisition and analysis were done with Axon Instruments software and hardware (pClamp v8.0, Digidata 1200 AD/DA interface). The kinetics of sorcin interaction with RyRs were estimated with a rapid solution exchange system (19Jiang M.T. Lokuta A.J. Farrell E.F. Wolff M.R. Haworth R.A. Valdivia H.H. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1015-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Rapid exchange of solutions at the cytosolic side of the channel was achieved with a 250-ml syringe under the control of a microprocessor (Model Micro1™, World Precision Instruments). The 0.5-mm internal diameter stainless-steel needle was introduced into the cis chamber and positioned with a micromanipulator ∼50 μm directly in front of the bilayer aperture. A piezoelectric circuit in the microprocessor activated the plunger of the syringe in step increments to infuse solutions. Activation of the piezoelectric circuit charged the bilayer membrane transiently, allowing recording of capacitative currents that marked the duration of the injection. Once the injection was complete, the concentration of the injected modulators near the bilayer surface remained constant for ∼10 s and then slowly diffused into the bulk solution until resting conditions were reestablished. The volume injected (typically 0.5 μl) produced negligible changes in the composition of the bulk solution, thus allowing injection of sorcin several times during the course of a single experiment (13Valdivia H.H. Kaplan J.H. Ellis-Davies G.C. Lederer W.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1997-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Effects of Sorcin on Resting RyR2s—Ca2+ sparks in resting cells represent spontaneous and coordinated openings of a cluster of RyRs (20Cannell M.B. Cheng H. Lederer W.J. Science. 1995; 268: 1045-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). We used Ca2+ sparks as an index of RyR activity to assess sorcin modulation of RyRs in situ (Fig. 1). Adult mouse cardiomyocytes were permeabilized with saponin, and Ca2+ sparks were recorded with a laser scanning confocal microscope in an internal solution containing 60 nm Ca2+ and 30 μm Fluo-4 salt (Fig. 1A). Perfusion of 1 μm sorcin onto cells resulted in clear reduction of Ca2+ spark frequency (Fig. 1B) and amplitude (Fig. 1C) compared with control. Half-duration and half-width of Ca2+ sparks were also significantly diminished (Fig. 1, D and E). To test for reversibility of sorcin effects, cells were reperfused with the control internal solution in the absence of sorcin. Ca2+ sparks characteristics recovered toward control levels during washout (not shown). Thus, sorcin imposes impressive attenuation of resting cardiac RyR activity. Sorcin Localization in Adult Cardiac Myocytes—Immunostaining of adult mouse cardiac myocytes was performed with a polyclonal antibody raised against the C terminus of sorcin. Fig. 2A shows bands of high intensity staining running along the width of the cell and interspaced at about ∼2 μm. This striated staining pattern overlaps with Z-lines and is suggestive of sorcin localization at or near T-tubules, whose spacing within the cell coincides with the observed staining. Control cells, where the primary antibody was omitted, lack this characteristic staining (Fig. 2B). The dyadic junction, where crucial steps of e-c coupling occur, comprises DHPRs residing on T-tubules and the juxtaposed RyRs on the SR. Sorcin localization within this area of the cell is thus appropriate for regulation of RyRs and e-c coupling. Dynamic, Ca2 + -dependent Properties of Sorcin—In vitro assays suggest that sorcin translocates from soluble to membrane-bound target proteins based on [Ca2+] (5Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Giangiacomo L. Colotti G. Pascarella S. Chiancone E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Vecchini P. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Meyers M.B. Zamparelli C. Verzili D. Dicker A.P. Blanck T.J. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We investigated whether endogenous sorcin in adult cardiomyocytes translocates from cytosolic to membranous compartments, and we measured the [Ca2+] required for the process. Cells freshly isolated from one adult mouse heart were split into several groups. Each group of cells was pelleted and suspended in a solution containing a given [Ca2+] in the absence (“intact”) or the presence (“permeabilized”) of 0.01% saponin for 1 min. All groups were then run in SDS gels and immunoblotted with the sorcin antibody (Fig. 3). Sorcin did not vary with [Ca2+] in the pellets of intact cells, as expected, because both cytosolic and membrane-bound sorcin were retained inside the intact cell (Fig. 3A). Conversely, sorcin retention in membranes of permeabilized cells was a function of [Ca2+] (Fig. 3A). The Ca2+ dependence of translocation in permeabilized cells is sigmoidal and may be fitted with a Hill equation that yields a half-maximal effective [Ca2+] (EC50) = 202 μm and cooperativity coefficient (n) = 1.8 (Fig. 3B). The latter suggests that each sorcin molecule binds ∼2 Ca2+ ions for translocation, which is consistent with previous studies that indicate that only two of the five EF-hands of sorcin bind Ca2+ (6Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Vecchini P. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The EC50, on the other hand, appears high and physiologically unattainable, but mathematical models estimate [Ca2+] at the dyadic junction to be several hundreds of micromolar during Ca2+ release (21Peskoff A. Langer G.A. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 153-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22Greenstein J.L. Winslow R.L. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2918-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It is possible, then, that sorcin translocation may be restricted to dyadic junctions and parajunctional areas, because the measured global [Ca2+] appears insufficient to induce translocation in intradyadic spaces. Thus, the privileged location of sorcin around T-tubule/SR junctions (Fig. 2), its capacity to modulate RyRs (Figs. 1 and 6), and its ability to translocate at high [Ca2+] all strengthen the notion that sorcin modulates e-c coupling.Fig. 6Sorcin inhibition of RyR activity.

Ilari A. Verzili D. Giangiacomo L. Colotti G. Pascarella S. Chiancone E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 658-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We exploited the intrinsic fluorescence of sorcin, conferred by two tryptophans in its amino acid sequence, to track its conformational changes in response to Ca2+. Fig. 4A shows that sorcin fluorescence, peaking at 330 nm, is highest when [Ca2+] is low (nanomolar) and is gradually quenched by increasing [Ca2+]. A plot of peak fluorescence versus pCa yields a sigmoidal relationship with EC50 = 5.3 μm and n = 0.68 (Fig. 4B). These values are markedly different from those obtained in Ca2+-dependent translocation of sorcin (Fig. 3) and suggest that the latter may be controlled by more than one dynamic step (see “Discussion”). Sorcin Modulation of Ca2 + Transients in Whole Cells—Excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac myocytes brings about abrupt and extensive changes in [Ca2+] i that, in principle, may induce structural changes in sorcin and stimulate its translocation from cytosol to membrane-bound target proteins. We patch-clamped adult mouse cardiomyocytes and measured Ca2+ transients, the inward Ca2+ current (I Ca), and cell shortening in the absence and the presence of 3 μm sorcin (Fig. 5). A voltage step from –45 mV to a test potential (–40 to +60 mV) was used to induce entry of external Ca2+ through L-type Ca2+ channels (I Ca), and to elicit CICR. The amplitude of the [Ca2+] i transients in cells dialyzed with sorcin was invariably lower than those in control cells (Fig. 5, A and C). This depression of the Ca2+ transient was apparent at all tested potentials (Fig. 5C), but time to peak was unaffected (Fig. 5F). Sorcin also shortened the duration of the [Ca2+] i transient (Fig. 5A). The decay rate (τdecay) was significantly faster in sorcin-dialyzed cells (Fig. 5F). These sorcin-induced alterations of the [Ca2+] i transient were accompanied by a corresponding decrease in cell shortening (Fig. 5D). Cardiac DHPRs have also been identified as molecular targets for sorcin (23Meyers M.B. Puri T.S. Chien A.J. Gao T. Hsu P.H. Hosey M.M. Fishman G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18930-18935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We found that the amplitude and kinetics of I Ca were unaltered by sorcin (Fig. 5A). A current-voltage relation for I Ca in control and sorcin-dialyzed cells reveals no significant differences (Fig. 5B). Thus, it appears that the decrease in the [Ca2+] i transient amplitude is not simply a product of decreased Ca2+ entry through DHPRs but more likely a direct effect of sorcin on RyRs. The ratio of [Ca2+] i transient amplitude versus the integral of I Ca, (F/F 0)/ΣI Ca, is a voltage-dependent process that is high at negative voltages and approaches zero at the Ca2+ reversal potential (Fig. 5E). This ratio, then, reflects the capacity of I Ca to elicit Ca2+ release and may be used as an empirical index of e-c coupling gain (24Santana L.F. Cheng H. Gomez A.M. Cannell M.B. Lederer W.J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 166-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Because sorcin decreased the amplitude of the [Ca2+] i transient without a concomitant decrease in I Ca, the overall effect of sorcin was to reduce e-c coupling gain (Fig. 5E).

They share common substrate specificity and structure, but differ completely in the sequence of their respective N-terminal regions including their N-peptides, a 23–28 residue segment that are removed during zymogen activation. We show that the N-peptide of caspase-7 plays no role in the fundamental activation or properties of the active protease in vitro. However, the N-peptide modifies the properties of caspase-7 in vivo. In ectopic expression experiments, caspase-7 constructs with no N-peptide are far more lethal than constructs that have an uncleavable peptide. Moreover, the N-peptide of caspase-7 must be removed before efficient activation of the zymogen can occur in vivo. These disparate requirements for the N-peptide argue that it serves to physically sequester the caspase-7 zymogen in a cytosolic location that prevents access by upstream activators (caspase-8, -9, and -10). The N-peptide must first be removed, probably by caspase-3, before efficient conversion and activation of the zymogen can occur in vivo.

Apoptosis is an orchestrated series of cellular events in which a doomed cell has its cellular component dismantled and packaged into smaller bodies more easily removed by neighboring cells or macrophages. At the core of the death process is a family of cytosolic cysteine proteases, caspases, with a specificity for aspartic acid residues (reviewed in Refs. 1Denault J.B. Salvesen G.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4489-4500Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 2Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 3Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Stimuli from death receptor ligands (extrinsic pathway) or a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, drugs or cellular stresses (intrinsic pathway) cause the activation of apical (initiator) caspase-8, -9, or -10. Once activated, these initiators are able to process and directly activate downstream executioner caspase-3 and -7. The limited proteolytic activity of the executioners on a set of cellular protein substrates is responsible for the hallmark phenotype of apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 2Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). For the executioner caspases, proteolysis between the large and small subunit is thought to be the fundamental activating event (4Chai J. Wu Q. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). All caspases possess N-terminal extensions, and in the case of the in initiators these are required for recruitment to the respective activation complexes. In contrast, a consensus role for the short N-terminal extensions of the executioners (Fig. 1A) has yet to be established. Initial findings suggest that the N-terminal peptides of caspase-3 and -7 have no effect on activity or the ability to be activated in vitro. However, in vivo both caspases seem to require the removal of the N-peptides for efficient activation. Indeed, in some cells caspase-3 removes the N-peptide of caspase-7 before the latter is activated by an initiator granzyme B, a serine protease that activates caspases during T-cell-mediated killing (9Yang X. Stennicke H.R. Wang B. Green D.R. Janicke R.U. Srinivasan A. Seth P. Salvesen G.S. Froelich C.J. J. Biol.

Hildebrandt A.K. Horak D. Haenisch C. Wendel A. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 135-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and caspase-6 (11Cowling V. Downward J.

Commun. 2002; 291: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The later hypothesis is appealing, but reports are conflicting regarding the subcellular localization of caspase-7. Although it is generally agreed that the zymogen of caspase-7 is cytosolic, subcellular fractionation experiments have suggested that active caspase-7 relocalizes to the nucleus (12Yaoita Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), microsomes (13Zhivotovsky B. Samali A. Gahm A. Orrenius S.

Some of those discrepancies may be artifacts of the experimental procedure given the fact that the pI of caspase-7 lacking the N-peptide is very different than the one of the zymogen (pI = 8.0 versus 5.5) and may cause the protein to precipitate upon N-peptide removal. Secondly and most importantly, apoptosis is associated with pH and ionic strength changes as well as nuclear-cytoplasmic barrier disruption (15Faleiro L. Lazebnik Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and may result in mixing and/or relocalization of compartment specific markers used in subcellular fractionation experiments. Finally, usage of EGFP fusion protein as a tracker for caspase localization (12Yaoita Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Shikama Y.U.M. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) may also be a source of experimental variation because of potential dimerization of green fluorescent proteins, natural tendency to localize to the nucleus and increase in molecular weight of the caspase complex. In the present study we have tested a number of these hypotheses for the function of the enigmatic N-peptide of caspase-7. Cell Culture and Transfection—293A cells (QBI-293A, Quantum Biotechnology Inc., Montréal, Canada) and COS-7 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultivated in DME medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA), 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) and routinely passed every 3 days. For ectopic expression, cells at 40–60% confluence were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) as suggested by the manufacturer using 3 μl of transfectant reagent per 1.0 μg of DNA in 0.1 ml of DME medium. Cells were treated and harvested as indicated for each experiment. Mammalian Expression Constructs—The cDNA for human caspase-7 (GenBank™ acc. no. NM_001227) was use as a template for all constructs. All pcDNA3 constructs were subcloned into KpnI and XhoI sites by PCR with oligonucleotides adding the appropriate restriction sites flanking the initiating methionine codon at the 5′-end and the stop codon at the 3′-end. The FLAG epitope was added to the C terminus (Fig. 1B) of each construct by PCR with the following reverse oligonucleotide 5′-ctcgagctacttgtcatcgtcgtccttgtagtcttgactgaagtagagttcc (FLAG coding sequence underlined). The ΔN deletion mutant was made by PCR with oligonucleotide 5′-cccaagcttggtaccgccatgaagccagaccggtcctcgttt that replaces residues 1–24 by a Kozak sequence (underlined). All mutations were made using Quick-Change XL mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following oligonucleotides and the corresponding reverse sequence: C186A (catalytic cysteine residue also known as 285 in the caspase-1 numbering system), 5′-cttcattcaggctgcccgagggacc; NC (D23A), 5′-gcaaatgaagattcagtggctgctaagccagaccgg; D198A, 5′-ggcatccaggccgctagcgggcccatcaatg; D206A, 5′-ccatcaatgacacggccgctaatcctc. All constructs were sequenced to ensure DNA sequence integrity. Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant caspases were expressed in Escherichia coli using as C-terminal His-tagged fusion proteins using the pET expression system (Novagen, Madison, WI). All constructs were subcloned into NdeI and XhoI sites of pET-23b(+) using the same strategy as for pcDNA3 constructs. The initiating methionine was contained within the NdeI site used in the subcloning. Proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli stain (Novagen) and purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography as previously described (17Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods. 1999; 17: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The NC and C186A mutants were generated as described above and the M45A mutant was obtained with the oligonucleotide 5′-gaagaaaaatgtcaccgcgcgatccatcaag and its reverse sequence. Immunoblot Analysis—Cell extracts were prepared in mRIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS) with general protease inhibitors (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 50 μm 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, 10 μm E-64, and 10 μm leupeptin). Polycaspase inhibitors were added when required (100 μm z-VAD-FMK 1The abbreviations used are: z-VAD-FMK, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethylketone; AFC, 7-amido-4-fluoromethylcoumarin; CHO, aldehyde; Chx, cycloheximide; Ac-, acetyl-; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; GrB, granzyme B; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; pNA, paranitroanilide; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. and 100 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO). Lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the insoluble material of the mRIPA extracts by boiling samples in 4 m urea and 1% SDS for 10 min. DNA was sheered by 10 passages through a 27-gauge needle. Samples from 2 × 105 cells were resolved on 8–18% acrylamide gradient gels, transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, and 10% methanol at constant current (0.4 A for 40–60 min) as previously described (18Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ensuing blots were processed to immunoblotting with the various antibodies and corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3000, APBiotech, Piscataway, NJ) and SuperSignal detection reagents (Pierce Chem. Co., Rockford, IL). Cytosolic extracts for cytochrome c were obtained using an hypertonic buffer (250 mm sucrose, 70 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, 200 μg/ml digitonin, and protease inhibitors) as previously described (19Adrain C. Creagh E.M. Martin S.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6627-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: caspase-7 (monoclonal, 1:1000), cytochrome c (monoclonal, 1:1000) and PARP (monoclonal, 1:1000, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); hsp90 (monoclonal, 1:2500) and protein kinase C δ, (polyclonal, 1:2000, Santa Cruz, CA); lamin B1, (monoclonal, 1:1000, Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA); anti-FLAG (M2, monoclonal, 5 μg/ml, Sigma). Enzymatic Assays—Transfected 293A cells grown in 60-mm dishes were prepared in 50 μl of mRIPA buffer, left on ice for 10 min and centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentration was determined using DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Similar amount of protein were assayed for caspase activity using 100 μm of fluorogenic Ac-DEVD-AFC substrate (Bachem Biosciences Inc., King of Prussia, PA) in caspase buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 0.1% Chaps, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) (17Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods. 1999; 17: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Amidolytic activity was measured on a f-max Molecular Device spectrofluorometer at 37 °C (EXλ = 405 nm, EMλ = 510 nm). Recombinant enzymes were titrated to determine the exact active site concentration as previously described (17Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods. 1999; 17: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and assays were carried in caspase buffer using either Ac-DEVD-AFC or the equivalent chromogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA (Abs. 405 nm). Enzymatic assays using recombinant or 35S-labeled in vitro-translated proteins were performed in caspase buffer at 37 °C in 20–50 μl reaction volume. Laemmli loading buffer was added, and samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with GelCode Blue stain reagent (Pierce) and dried. In vitro translation was done using the TnT in vitro translation kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI); an equivalent amount of radioactive substrate was used for each assay. Affinity Capture Assay—Cells were transfected in 60-mm plates with the indicated constructs 24–36 h prior labeling. Media was replaced with warm media containing 1 μm biotinyl-VAD(OMe)-FMK (ICN Pharmaceutical inc., Irvine, CA) and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested, washed and lysed in 0.5 ml of mRIPA buffer with the protease inhibitor mixture described above. Samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (M2, 10 μg/ml), anti-caspase-3 (1:250) or anti-caspase-6 (10 μl of crude serum, generous gift of Dr. S. Krajewski) antibodies at 4 °C for 16 h. Protein-A/G agarose beads (30 μl slurry, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complex was recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with mRIPA buffer. Samples were resolved on SDS-PAGE gels and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described above. Biotinylated proteins were revealed using streptavidin-HRP (0.2 μg/ml, Sigma) in i-Block buffer (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) and SuperSignal reagents. DNA Fragmentation Assays—293A cells grown in 90-mm dishes were transfected, harvested, washed, and lysed in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100) and left on ice for 15 min. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 10 min and DNase-free RNase was added to 50 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. SDS was added to 0.1% and proteinase K to 0.1 mg/ml and further incubated at 50 °C for 16 h. Samples were extracted twice with phenol:chloroform and ethanol-precipitated with 0.3 m sodium acetate. DNA was resuspended in water and analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide (20Kaufmann S.H. Mesner Jr., P.W. Samejima K. Tone S. Earnshaw W.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 3-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown in slide chambers and transfected with the appropriate plasmid. Cells were washed twice with warm PBS and fixed with methanol for 2 min. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 37 °C, and samples were processed using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, 10 μg/ml) and a FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Samples were stained with DAPI (250 nm) and mounted with VectaShield (Burlingame, CA). Deletion of the N-Peptide Enhances the Ability of Caspase-7 to Kill—To obtain insight into the role of the N-peptide of caspase-7 we generated two mutants, one lacks the first 23 residues and corresponds to an N-peptide deletion (ΔN-caspase-7), and one contains a single amino acid mutation (D23A) making the N-peptide non-cleavable (NC-caspase-7, Fig. 1B). These were compared with wild-type caspase-7 for their ability to initiate death in recipient human 293A cells. Expression of FLAG-tagged caspase-7 in 293A cells is sufficient to cause some cell death but deletion of the N-peptide greatly increased the effect whereas prevention of N-peptide removal abrogates it (Fig. 2A). This differential effect is overcome at very high expression levels (3 μg plasmid/60-mm dishes) upon which all caspase-7 constructs were able to produce massive cell death (not shown). In all transfection experiments the onset of cell death, measured by detachment from the dish, was sooner with ΔN-caspase-7 than wild type or NC-caspase-7. This is not due to disparity in protein levels since immunoblot analysis of FLAG-tagged caspase-7 constructs from cell extracts revealed equivalent expression levels (Fig. 2B, top). Furthermore, the amount of ΔN-caspase-7 present seems to be less as detected by a caspase-7 antibody (Fig. 2B, middle). It is noteworthy that substantial processing of the N-peptide of WT caspase-7 occurs during the expression period. The catalytic mutant, C186A, had no effect on cell viability and is not processed. To quantify caspase activation induced by the constructs we performed a time-course analysis using different amounts of transfected DNA. Transfected cells were harvested at various time points and the caspase activity in cell extracts was measured using Ac-DEVD-AFC substrate (Fig. 2, C and D). In our hands saturation occurs when more than 2.5 μg/60-mm dish are used. We thus used DNA amounts up to 2.0 μg to detect changes in the activation profile and data for 0.5 and 2.0 μg are shown. Caspase activity was minimal at 12 h post-transfection for both conditions but increases afterward to reach a maximum at 38 h before declining. Most interestingly, at lower expression levels ΔN-caspase-7 activity increased dramatically at 18 h as compare with WT/NC-caspase-7 suggesting a faster activation rate (Fig. 2C); similar results were obtained using 0.25 μg of transfected DNA (data not shown). This difference was not apparent when higher amounts of DNA were used (Fig. 2D and data not shown). Even in the latter condition widespread cell death was delayed by ∼6 h for wild-type and NC-caspase-7 as compared with ΔN-caspase-7 samples. This is despite the fact that no more DEVDase activity was observed, and suggests that removal of the N-peptide is important for the caspase-7 killing effect. As a measure of the amount of caspase (DEVDase) activity that is generated following caspase-7 transfection we compared the results with cell death induced by ectopic expression of the intrinsic pathway activator Bax. Transfection of caspase-7 results in a 10-fold increase of DEV-Dase activity in cell extracts as compared with the maximum activity obtained in Bax-transfected cells suggesting that the measured activity is mainly attributed to caspase-7 (data not shown). Cleavage within the linker region of caspase-7 is strictly required for its activation (4Chai J. Wu Q. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y.

This region contains 2 cleavage sites that could each potentially result in activation of the zymogen (Fig. 1B). Therefore we generated Asp/Ala mutations at each site for expression in 293A cells (Fig. 3). Analysis using anti-caspase-7 and anti-FLAG antibodies shows that mutation of D198A abrogates cleavage of the linker region whereas mutation of D206A did not impede cleavage (Fig. 3, A and B). It is noteworthy that removal of the N-peptide was observed for all constructs probably owing the to ability of caspase-7 overexpression to activate endogenous caspase-7 (data not shown). Albeit weak, a cleavage fragment was observed with the D198A mutant that prompted us to test whether or not this species was active or simply an aberrant cleavage product. To do this we employed an affinity-labeling strategy to capture active caspases (22Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I. Ricci J.-E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were incubated with the biotinylated cell permeable irreversible polycaspase inhibitor, biotinyl-VAD(OMe)-FMK. Caspase-7 was then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and biotinylated proteins were detected with streptavidin-HRP (Fig. 3C). It is only when Asp198 was available for cleavage that a robust labeling of caspase-7 was observed confirming that caspase-7 activation as a consequence of overexpression is a sequential event requiring processing of Asp198 without prior to cleavage at Asp206. Caspase-7 Is the Most Downstream Caspase—Although caspase-7 is generally accepted to be a downstream (executioner) caspase (9Yang X. Stennicke H.R. Wang B. Green D.R. Janicke R.U. Srinivasan A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20977-20980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) its overexpression might lead to the activation of other caspases, in which case cell death would be a combination of multiple executioner (caspase-3, -6, and -7) activity and not solely that of caspase-7. Furthermore most caspases, and particularly caspase-3, exert overlapping substrate specificity with caspase-7 (24Stennicke H.R. Renatus M. Meldal M. Salvesen G.S. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 25Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar) making the simple readout of DEVDase activity unreliable in diagnosis. Immunoblot analysis failed to reveal any processed caspase-3 or -6 in cell extracts of transfected cells (data not shown). However, because active caspase amounts undetectable by standard Western analysis may still be significant in cell death (26Marsden V.S. O'Connor L. O'Reilly L.A. Silke J. Metcalf D. Ekert P.G. Huang D.C. Cecconi F. Kuida K. Tomaselli K.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Vaux D.L. Bouillet P. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Nature. 2002; 419: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), we used affinity capture of caspases as a more sensitive approach. Using this method all three catalytically competent caspase-7 constructs were readily labeled (Fig. 4A). However, when caspase-3 (Fig. 4B) and caspase-6 (Fig. 4C) were selectively immunoprecipitated from transfected cell lysates no labeling was detected. The intensity of the labeled caspase-3 and -6 in a positive control extract, programmed to undergo caspase activation by Bax-transfection, suggests that none of those caspases were activated by the expressed caspase-7. Importantly, the lack of caspase-3 and -6 activation following overexpression of caspase-7 indicates that none of the apical caspases (caspase-8, -9, or -10) able to activate executioner zymogens had become activated. Cell Death by Caspase-7—Having established that caspase-7 overexpression does not lead to the activation of other caspases, we looked for processing of indicator death substrates known to be caspase-3 or -7 substrates. We choose PARP (27Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar) as a nuclear substrate and PKCδ (28Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) as a cytosolic substrate. Expression of caspase-7 results in cleavage of PARP to the diagnostic 86-kDa fragment, and a 36-kDa fragment characteristic of apoptosis is generated from full-length PKCδ (Fig. 5). In both cases, ΔN-caspase-7 was more effective in cleaving the substrates. It is noteworthy that Bax overexpression results in more PARP cleavage than simple ectopic expression of ΔN-caspase-7. This suggests that whereas caspase-7 can cleave PARP in vivo, a collaborating caspase facilitates access to PARP, possibly by enhancing nuclear entry. We examined lamin B1, a known substrate of caspase-6 (29Takahashi A. Alnemri E.S. Lazebnik Y.A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Litwack G. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16443-16446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), and found no cleavage whereas almost the entire pool of lamin B1 is cleaved in Bax-transfected cells. This demonstrates that caspase-7 overexpression does not generate excessive nonspecific proteolysis. We further examined DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5B), a hallmark of apoptosis (31Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). The extent of DNA fragmentation was comparable to Bax-transfected cells with wild-type and ΔN-caspase-7, slightly reduced with NC-caspase-7, and absent from cells transfected with an empty plasmid or caspase-7 catalytic mutant. To determine whether apoptosis induced by caspase-7 implicates the mitochondrial pathway we also checked for release of pro-apoptotic mediators from mitochondria in transfected cells. No increase in cytosolic cytochrome c (Fig. 5C) or SMAC/DIABLO (data not shown) was detected as compared with positive control cells transfected with Bax, ruling out participation of mitochondria in cell death mediated by caspase-7. Human Caspase-7 Is Not a Nuclear Caspase—Shortly after the N-peptide of caspase-7 is a stretch of basic residues (K38KKK, Fig. 1B) reminiscent of a nuclear localization signal. Removal of the N-peptide during apoptosis could expose this signal and cause relocation of caspase-7 as suggested for the Xenopus ortholog (12Yaoita Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We thus examined the subcellular localization of FLAG-tagged caspase-7. However, because cell death, for example by caspase-7 overexpression, is accompanied by important morphologic changes we examined the subcellular localization of the respective catalytic mutants in COS-7 cells (Fig. 6A). No difference in staining pattern was found for any of the full-length, ΔN, or NC-caspase-7 constructs; all were mainly excluded from the nucleus. This is consistent with subcellular fractionation experiments showing that both ΔN and NC-caspase-7 catalytic mutant were fully cytosolic (data not shown). Our results do not exclude that a small portion of caspase-7 may find its way to apoptotic nuclei, but they rule out the possibility that removal of the N-peptide allows an active transport or accumulation of human caspase-7 in the nuclei. Removal of the N-Peptide Alters Self-activation of Caspase-7—The enhanced apoptosis attributable to N-peptide removal may reflect an increase in the inherent enzymatic activity of caspase-7. To test this we determined the kinetic parameters of recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli. Proteins were expressed as C-terminal His tag fusions and purified to near homogeneity by Ni2+-affinity chromatography as described (17Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods. 1999; 17: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Using active site-titrated enzymes, we established that ΔN-caspase-7 is enzymatically similar to wild type or NC-caspase-7. Indeed, Km and k cat values for ΔN-caspase-7 and NC-caspase-7 on the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC and the chromogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-pNA were identical within experimental error (Table I). It is thus clear that any phenotypes observed in transfection experiments using the corresponding proteins are unlikely to be due to differences in catalytic activity but rather to some property of the N-peptide itself.Table IKinetic parameters of caspase-7 constructsSubstrate EnzymeKmaValues are averages of 2 differe"

We evaluated whether PARP activation is present and whether two unrelated PARP inhibitors, 3-aminobenzamide (ABA) and 1,5-isoquinolinediol (ISO), counteract overexpression of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and ET receptors in the renal cortex in short-term diabetes. The studies were performed in control rats and streptozotocin-diabetic rats treated with/without ABA or ISO (30 and 3 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1), intraperitoneally, for 2 weeks after 2 weeks of diabetes). Poly (ADP-ribose) immunoreactivity was increased in tubuli, but not glomeruli, of diabetic rats and this increase was corrected by ISO, whereas ABA had a weaker effect. ET-1 concentration (ELISA) was increased in diabetic rats, and this elevation was blunted by ISO. ET-1, ET(A), and ET(B) mRNA (ribonuclease protection assay), but not ET-3 mRNA (RT/PCR), abundance was increased in diabetic rats, and three variables were, at least, partially corrected by ISO. ABA produced a trend towards normalization of ET-1 concentration and ET-1, ET(A), and ET(B) mRNA abundance, but the differences with untreated diabetic group were not significant. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is involved in diabetes-induced renal overexpression of ET-1 and ET receptors. PARP inhibitors could provide a novel therapeutic approach for diabetic complications including nephropathy, and other diseases that involve the endothelin system."
https://openalex.org/W2040490477,"The widely distributed phytochrome photoreceptors carry a bilin chromophore, which is covalently attached to the protein during a lyase reaction. In plant phytochromes, the natural chromophore is coupled by a thioether bond between its ring A ethylidene side chain and a conserved cysteine residue within the so-called GAF domain of the protein. Many bacterial phytochromes carry biliverdin as natural chromophore, which is coupled in a different manner to the protein. In phytochrome Agp1 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, biliverdin is covalently attached to a cysteine residue close to the N terminus (position 20). By testing different natural and synthetic biliverdin derivatives, it was found that the ring A vinyl side chain is used for chromophore attachment. Only those bilins that have ring A vinyl side chain were covalently attached, whereas bilins with an ethylidene or ethyl side chain were bound in a noncovalent manner. Phycocyanobilin, which belongs to the latter group, was however covalently attached to a mutant in which a cysteine was introduced into the GAF domain of Agp1 (position 249). It is proposed that the regions around positions 20 and 249 are in close contact and contribute both to the chromophore pocket. In competition experiments it was found that phycocyanobilin and biliverdin bind with similar strength to the wild type protein. However, in the V249C mutant, phycocyanobilin bound much more strongly than biliverdin.

This finding could explain why during phytochrome evolution in cyanobacteria, the chromophore-binding site swapped from the N terminus into the GAF domain. Phytochromes are biliprotein photoreceptors that were discovered in plants (1Butler W.L. Norris K.H. Siegelman H.W. Hendricks S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1959; 45: 1703-1708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but were recently also found in bacteria (2Lamparter T. Mittmann F. Gärtner W. Börner T. Hartmann E. Hughes J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 3Yeh K.C. Wu S.H. Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1505-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 4Davis S.J.

The photocycle of phytochromes has two long-lived forms, the red-absorbing form (Pr), 1The abbreviations used are: Pr, red-absorbing form of phytochrome; Pfr, far red-absorbing form of phytochrome; BV, biliverdin; PCB, phycocyanobilin; PΦB, phytochromobilin. which is synthesized in darkness, and the far red-absorbing form (Pfr). Both forms are reversibly interconverted by light. In general, both forms are stable in darkness, but exceptions are often found. The Pfr form of many plant phytochromes (7Mancinelli A. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis of Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 211-269Google Scholar) and phytochrome 1 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens (here termed Agp1) (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) slowly converts to Pr in darkness. In the case of Bradyrhizobium phytochrome and Agrobacterium phytochrome 2, Pr converts to Pfr in darkness (9Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P. Dreyfus B. Vermeglio A. Nature. 2002; 417: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 10Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Typically, the phytochrome proteins consist of an N-terminal chromophore module, to which one bilin chromophore is covalently attached, and a C-terminal output module. In prokaryotic phytochromes, the output module is most often a histidine kinase (2Lamparter T. Mittmann F. Gärtner W. Börner T. Hartmann E. Hughes J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), but other C-terminal modules are also possible (9Giraud E. Fardoux J. Fourrier N. Hannibal L. Genty B. Bouyer P. Dreyfus B. Vermeglio A. Nature. 2002; 417: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 10Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Almost all plant phytochromes have a histidine-kinase like domain and an additional ∼300-amino acid stretch with two PAS domains, which is located between the chromophore module and the histidine-kinase-like domain (11Montgomery B.L. Lagarias J.C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Within the chromophore module, the GAF domain and a PHY domain, which is located C-terminal of the GAF domain, can be distinguished. The GAF domain is the region most homologous among the phytochrome family. Further N-terminal of this domain, there are 140–200 additional amino acids of lower homology. Within this region, a PAS domain was identified in some phytochrome species (11Montgomery B.L. Lagarias J.C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The domain structure of Agrobacterium phytochrome Agp1 is given in Fig. 1. Plant phytochromes carry either phytochromobilin (PΦB) or phycocyanobilin (PCB) as chromophore (12Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis of Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 51-69Google Scholar, 13Wu S.H. McDowell M.T. Lagarias J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25700-25705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Both bilins are synthesized from biliverdin (BV) by reduction of the BV ring A double bond and a concomitant conversion of ring A vinyl to ethylidene. For PCB biosynthesis, the ring D vinyl group is further reduced to an ethyl group (14Kohchi T. Mukougawa K. Frankenberg N. Masuda M. Yokota A. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 425-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 15Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In plant phytochromes, the chromophore binds covalently to the protein by a thioether bond between the ring A ethylidene side chain of the chromophore (12Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis of Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 51-69Google Scholar) and a conserved cysteine within the GAF domain. In cyanobacteria, two types of phytochromes are distinguished with respect to chromophore attachment. In some phytochromes such as Cph1 from Synechocystis or CphA of Calothrix, the cysteine residue is conserved (2Lamparter T. Mittmann F. Gärtner W. Börner T. Hartmann E. Hughes J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11792-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16Jorissen H.J. Quest B. Remberg A. Coursin T. Braslavsky S.E. Schaffner K. Tandeau de Marsac N. Gärtner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2662-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These phytochromes also attach PCB or PΦB in a covalent manner. Most cyanobacteria synthesize large amounts of PCB as phycobiliprotein compound, and PCB was found as a natural chromophore of Cph1 (17Hübschmann T. Börner T. Hartmann E. Lamparter T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2055-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Other cyanobacterial phytochromes, such as CphB from Calothrix, are missing the chromophore-binding cysteine in the GAF domain. Recombinant CphB incorporates PCB to a photoactive adduct, but the attachment is noncovalent, and the bilin can easily be removed from the protein. When a cysteine was introduced at the appropriate site of CphB, the protein bound PCB covalently (16Jorissen H.J. Quest B. Remberg A. Coursin T. Braslavsky S.E. Schaffner K. Tandeau de Marsac N. Gärtner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2662-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Phytochromes of other bacteria are all missing the chromophore-binding cysteine in the GAF domain (4Davis S.J. Vener A.V. Vierstra R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2517-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 5Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D.

A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). As far as analyzed, these phytochromes incorporate BV as natural chromophore (5Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), but recombinant proteins assemble to photoactive adducts also with PCB and PΦB (4Davis S.J. Vener A.V. Vierstra R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2517-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For phytochrome Agp1 from A. tumefaciens, it was shown by site-directed mutagenesis that BV is covalently bound to a cysteine residue close to the N terminus of the protein (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These results have been confirmed by mass spectrometry analyses. 2M. Carrascal, J. Abian, N. Michael, G. Rottwinkler, and T. Lamparter, personal communication. This cysteine residue is highly conserved within the group of BV-binding phytochromes and is probably also used as attachment site in other phytochromes of this group. Because BV has a vinyl side chain at ring A, the coupling mechanism must be different between Agp1 and plant phytochromes. It has been proposed that BV binds via its ring D to the protein (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), but this assumption has not been confirmed by chemical studies. Chemically synthesized bilins have been used to characterize the chromophore pocket and to study photoconversion and physiological action of plant phytochromes (18Hanzawa H. Shinomura T. Inomata K. Kakiuchi T. Kinoshita H. Wada K. Furuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4725-4729Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Hanzawa H. Inomata K. Kinoshita H. Kakiuchi T.

Gärtner W. Schaffner K. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1998; 37: 1843-1846Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here we used synthetic BV derivatives to test whether the ring A or ring D vinyl side chain is used for covalent BV attachment in Agp1. We also tested whether PCB binds covalently to the protein if a cysteine residue is introduced in the GAF domain of Agp1. Competition studies with BV and PCB were performed to further characterize the chromophore pocket of Agp1. Our findings have implications for the three-dimensional folding of the protein, the lyase mechanism, and the early evolution of phytochromes. Bilin Chromophores, Synthesis of Bilin Derivatives—BV was purchased from Frontier Scientific (Carnforth, UK). Phycocyanobilin was extracted from Spirulina geitlerie and purified via high pressure liquid chromatography (21Lamparter T. Esteban B. Hughes J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4720-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The synthesis of PΦB was performed as described (22Kakiuchi T. Kinoshita H. Inomata K. Synlett. 1999; SI: 901-904Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Synthesis of 3-Et-BV, 18-Et-BV, 3-18-Et-BV, and BV-4 followed protocols published for PΦB, PCB, and PCB derivatives (22Kakiuchi T. Kinoshita H. Inomata K. Synlett. 1999; SI: 901-904Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Kakiuchi T. Kato H. Jaysundera K.P. Higashi T. Watabe K. Sawamoto D. Kinoshita H. Inomata K. Chem.

Lett. 2001; : 588-589Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar); the experimental details will be published elsewhere. Bilin stock solutions were prepared in methanol. The concentrations of stock solutions were measured spectroscopically in 2% HCl and methanol, assuming an extinction coefficient of 30.8 mm–1 cm–1 for BV (26McDonagh A.F. Dolphin D. The Porphyrins. Academic Press, New York1979: 293-491Crossref Google Scholar) and 37.9 mm–1 cm–1 for PCB (27Cole W.J. Chapman D.J. Siegelman H.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 3642-3645Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) at the absorption maximum in the red region of the spectrum. For 3-Et-BV, 18-Et-BV, 3-18-Et-BV, and BV-4, we used the same value as for BV. In the case of PΦB it was assumed that the extinction coefficient is identical to PCB. Purification of Agp1 and the Mutant V249C—An Escherichia coli expression clone pAG1 in which the gene for Agrobacterium phytochrome Agp1 has been cloned into the pQE12 vector (Qiagen) was used (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The expressed protein has an N-terminal polyhistidine tag. The V249C mutant was made with a Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Details of apoprotein expression and purification are given in earlier publications (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). After Ni2+ affinity chromatography, the protein fractions were pooled, and the protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate, resuspended in Tris buffer (50 mm Tris/Cl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.8), and stored at –80 °C. Spectral Characterization and Assay for Covalent Attachment—Spectra were recorded with a Uvikon 931 photometer (Kontron/Biotek, Milano, Italy) at 18 °C. The protein concentration was adjusted to ∼10 μm as judged by absorbance at 280 nm. For chromophore assembly, 500 μl of apoprotein were mixed with up to 10 μl of bilin from the stock solution to achieve a final bilin concentration of 4–12 μm. The Pr spectra were usually measured directly after this mixing process. Photoconversion into Pfr was performed in the measuring cuvette by irradiation with a 660-nm light-emitting diode (∼50 μmol m–2 s–1) until photoconversion reached an apparent equilibrium as checked by absorbance at 700 nm. Thereafter, a second spectrum was recorded. The difference spectra were calculated from both absorption spectra. To test for covalent chromophore-protein interaction, 500 μl of bilin-Agp1 were mixed with 55 μl of 10% SDS to achieve a final SDS concentration of 1%. In general, SDS was added ∼1 min after the chromophore was mixed with Agp1 apoprotein. In the case of the V249C mutant, SDS was added 1 h after start of chromophore assembly. Two minutes after the addition of SDS, a spectrum of the sample was recorded. Thereafter, 500 μl of the same sample were applied to a NAP-5 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated in SDS buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris/Cl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.8). Another 1 ml of SDS buffer was applied to the column. The eluted fraction contains protein with covalently bound bilin and is depleted of free bilin. A spectrum of this sample was also recorded. The protein peak at 280 nm was used to normalize both spectra, and from the absorbance in the visible range, it was judged whether chromophore co-elutes with the protein. When covalent chromophore attachment was measured in the competition experiments, only spectra after the NAP-5 separation are shown. The proposed natural chromophore of Agp1 is BV (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Besides BV, we tested the naturally occurring PCB and PΦB, three BV-derivatives with reduced ring A and/or ring D side chains, namely 3-Et-BV, 18-Et-BV, 3-18-Et-BV, and BV-4, in which the ring D vinyl group of the C18 position is exchanged with the methyl group of the C17 position for their interaction with the Agp1 protein. Chromophore assembly results in the formation of the Pr form, which is recognized by unambiguous spectral features; upon incorporation into the protein, the maximum of the red absorption band of the chromophore shifts to approximately 700 nm. At the same time, absorbance in this spectral region increases and exceeds that of the blue absorption band (see Fig. 4a for free BV and Fig. 2a for the BV adduct). This behavior was found for all chromophores tested (Fig. 2, a–g), indicating that they all formed adducts with the Agp1 protein. In addition, all adducts showed the typical photoconversion into the longer wavelength Pfr form upon irradiation with red light. The maximum of the Pr red absorption band correlated with the number of bilin double bonds that participate in the conjugated π-electron system (Table I). Biliverdin and BV-4 have 13 double bonds, and their adducts showed rather long wavelength absorption maxima at 701 and 698 nm, respectively. Both chromophores with 11 double bonds, PCB and 3-18-Et-BV, gave adducts with the shortest wavelength absorption maxima at 685 and 683 nm, respectively. Those chromophores with 12 double bonds, PΦB, 3-Et-BV, and 18-Et-BV, had intermediate absorption maxima. The values of PΦB and 3-Et-BV were close together and 5–7 nm above that of 18-Et-BV, indicating that the ring D vinyl double bond contributes more to the π-electron system than the ring A vinyl double bond.Fig. 2Chromophore assembly with Agp1 and Agp1-V249C. a–g, Agp1 (∼10 μm) was mixed with BV and BV derivatives. The abbreviation and chemical structure of the chromophores is given in each panel. The final concentration of BV was 9 μm, and the concentration of the other bilins was ∼5 μm. h, the Agp1 V249C mutant (10 μm) was mixed with PCB (∼3 μm) and assayed after 60 min. Each panel shows the Pr spectrum after mixing chromophore and protein (solid line), the spectrum after photoconversion by red light (dotted line), and the Pr minus Pfr difference spectrum (dashed line).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ISummary of spectral parameters of Figs. 2 and 3.Absorption spectrum (Pr λmax)Difference spectrumAdductλmaxλminλmin minus λmaxPr/Pfr absorbance ratioCovalent attachmentnmnmnmnmBV Agp1701700752521.11Yes3-Et-BV Agp1695694739452.12No18-Et-BV Agp1690688739510.82Yes3-18-Et-BV Agp1683682726441.65NoBV-4 Agp1698697740431.18YesPΦB Agp1697696745491.49NoPCB Agp1685683731481.07NoPCB Agp1-V249C654652700481.00Yes Open table in a new tab Photoconversion into Pfr of the BV adduct lead to a 52-nm red shift of the red absorption band, as deduced from the difference spectrum (Table I). The values of 18-Et-BV with 51 nm, PCB with 48 nm, and PΦB with 49 nm were rather close to BV, whereas all other chromophores gave shifts at approximately 45 nm. During phytochrome photoconversion, the chromophore undergoes a Z to E isomerization around its C15/C16 double bond (12Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis of Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 51-69Google Scholar), but further structural details for the strong red shift are unknown. A rather small shift might indicate that the chromophore is displaced in the Pfr form. We have also calculated the absorbance ratio between the Pr and the Pfr band of the difference spectrum. The lowest value of 0.8 was obtained with 18-Et-BV. Biliverdin, BV-4, and PCB gave values of approximately 1, and the values with PΦB and 3-18-Et-BV were approximately 1.5, whereas a rather high value above 2 was obtained with 3-Et-BV (Table I). It seems that a ring D vinyl side chain acts positively on the absorbance ratio and that a ring A vinyl side chain acts negatively on that parameter. Covalent attachment of the chromophores was tested by SDS-denaturation/dissociation followed by separation of protein and free bilin on desalting columns. If the chromophore is covalently bound, it elutes together with the protein from the desalting column, whereas noncovalently bound chromophore is separated from the protein by SDS and remains almost entirely inside the column (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Spectra that are recorded before and after the column separation are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra were normalized at the protein absorption band (280 nm) to compensate for dilution effects that occur during the separation. After SDS denaturation, the blue and red absorption bands of the chromophores appear at approximately 380 and 620 nm, respectively. The spectrum of the BV adduct was slightly altered during the column separation in the blue region, an effect that might be explained by conformational alterations during the SDS treatment or by interactions with the column matrix (Fig. 3a). The assay shows, however, that most if not all BV was covalently attached to the protein. In the case of 18-Et-BV, both spectra were almost identical; thus 100% of the chromophore were covalently bound (Fig. 3c). From the spectra of the BV-4 adduct, it can be judged that approximately 90% of the chromophore were covalently attached (Fig. 3e). All three covalently bound chromophores have a ring A vinyl side chain but differ by their ring D side chains. Those chromophores that contain a ring A ethyl or ethylidene side chain, namely 3-Et-BV, 3-18-Et-BV, PCB, and PΦB, were noncovalently bound to the protein. In all those cases, the absorbance in the visible range was very small after the column separation (Fig. 3, b, d, f, and g). Because ∼5% of free bilins elute from the desalting columns under the test conditions (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), minor traces of chromophore absorbance might be attributed to co-eluted free bilin. The noncovalent mode of PCB-protein interaction in Agp1 is comparable with CphB from the cyanobacterium Calothrix.We tested for Agp1 whether the introduction of a cysteine in the GAF domain can also mediate covalent attachment of PCB as was found for CphB (16Jorissen H.J. Quest B. Remberg A. Coursin T. Braslavsky S.E. Schaffner K. Tandeau de Marsac N. Gärtner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2662-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The amino acid valine 249, which is homologous to the chromophore-binding cysteine of plant phytochromes, was replaced by cysteine, and the purified protein Agp1-V249C was tested for PCB assembly. The adduct had a Pr absorption maximum of 654 nm and was thus blue-shifted by 30 nm as compared with the PCB adduct of wild type Agp1; the Pfr peak was also blue-shifted to 700 nm (Fig. 2h and Table I). This shift implies that the ethylidene double bond of PCB, which is part of the π-electron system, is saturated as a result of the formation of a covalent thioether link. Covalent attachment was confirmed by the SDS assay (Fig. 3h). To see whether two types of chromophores use the same chromophore-binding site, competition experiments were performed with BV and PCB. Agp1 was first mixed with PCB of slight molar excess and then incubated with additional BV (Fig. 4b). In the opposite experiment, the apoprotein was first mixed with BV and then incubated with PCB (Fig. 4c). Addition of the second chromophore increased the absorbance in the red region only slightly, this increase results from the low and broad absorption of free bilin (Fig. 4a). This finding shows that the same pocket is used for both chromophores. In both competition experiments, the Pr absorption maxima shifted immediately after the addition of the second chromophore (Fig. 4, b and c). A simple superposition of the spectrum of either free chromophore and the Pr absorption spectrum of either adduct does not significantly alter the position of the Pr absorption maximum (data not show). Hence, the observed shifts show that the incorporated bilin was partially replaced by the added second bilin in both competition experiments. During the subsequent minutes, the shifts increased further (Fig. 4f, closed symbols). After 4 h, the absorption maxima of both mixing experiments reached a constant value of 695 nm (data not shown). Because this value is closer to the absorption maximum of the BV adduct than to the PCB adduct, it seems that BV binds slightly stronger to Agp1 than PCB, but the results clearly show that covalent BV attachment does not lead to an exclusive binding. These findings raised the question whether the covalent BV-Agp1 3BV-Apg1 indicates the biliverdin adduct of Agp1. Other adducts are abbreviated accordingly. link is lost by the PCB competition. We thus compared covalent BV attachment with and without additional PCB. The spectra that were obtained after SDS-denaturation and column separation were almost identical (Fig. 4g). Therefore, excess PCB does not induce the cleavage of BV from the binding site. We also tested for chromophore competition after photoconversion. When the PCB Agp1 adduct was irradiated with red light to convert most of the phytochrome into the Pfr form and BV was added to the sample, a new Pr band appeared at 701 nm. In this case, BV clearly competed with PCB of the Pfr adduct, because the rise of new BV-Pr was accompanied by a reduction of the Pfr absorption band at ∼730 nm (Fig. 4d). Qualitatively the same result was obtained when the BV adduct was converted to Pfr and PCB was added to the sample (Fig. 4e). The shift of the absorption maximum that was observed subsequently (Fig. 4f, open symbols) is explained by dark reversion of residual Pfr. Competition experiments with BV and PCB were also performed with the V249C mutant, which has one covalent binding site for either chromophore. When the protein was first assembled with PCB, and BV was added thereafter, the position of the Pr peak remained unchanged (Fig. 4h). At approximately 700 nm, the position of the BV Pr adduct, a weak shoulder was formed that increased slightly during the subsequent hours (shown for t = 5 h in Fig. 4h). These data show that PCB is hardly replaced by BV in the mutant protein. When V249C was first assembled with BV, and PCB was added thereafter, the replacement of BV by PCB was clearly visible. Immediately after PCB addition, the Pr absorption maximum shifted to lower wavelengths, and a shoulder appeared at ∼650 nm, the position of the PCB Pr adduct. After 5 h a prominent peak was observed at 650 nm that rose at the expense of the 700 nm peak (Fig. 4i). Both competition experiments show that (i) PCB binds much stronger to the mutant protein than BV and (ii) PCB binds stronger to the mutant than to the wild type protein. Because in the mutant, either of both chromophores can form a covalent link with the protein, two different chromophores can become covalently bound to one protein unit, as is evident from the assembly spectra of Fig. 4i. This assumption was confirmed by SDS assays (Fig. 4j). After SDS treatment and column separation, the sample in which Agp1-V249C was first assembled with BV and then with PCB had higher chromophore absorbance values than the sample that was assembled with BV alone. In plant phytochromes, the phytochromobilin chromophore is bound to a conserved cysteine within the GAF domain (12Rüdiger W. Thümmler F. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis of Plants. 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 51-69Google Scholar). Covalent BV attachment has recently been shown for several bacterial phytochromes (5Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), but it was unclear which BV side group is used as attachment site. The present work approaches this question for Agrobacterium phytochrome Agp1 by using different bilin derivatives. Whereas all tested chromophores formed spectrally integer adducts that showed the typical photoconversion into the Pfr form, only those bilins that have a ring A vinyl side chain were covalently attached to the protein. We therefore propose that the ring A vinyl group forms a thioether bond with the cysteine 20 residue of Agp1. In general, the ratio between the Pr and the Pfr absorbance was low when the ring A vinyl side chain was present in the chromophore. One can thus conclude that a covalently linked chromophore gives a higher relative extinction coefficient for the Pfr form of Agp1. This assumption agrees with an earlier study, in which covalent BV attachment was blocked by cysteine-reactive agents or by mutation of the chromophore-binding cysteine (8Lamparter T. Michael N. Mittmann F. Esteban B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11628-11633Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although the photocycle is possible with noncovalently attached chromophores, full formation of Pfr seems to be dependent on covalent attachment, probably because only a tight coupling can confer forces required to guide the chromophore into the correct conformation. During the evolution of phytochromes, there was a switch from BV to PCB/PΦB chromophores that took place in the group of cyanobacteria. Biliverdin-binding phytochromes have a conserved cysteine close to the N terminus, which at least in Agp1 is used as a chromophore attachment site; the other species have a conserved chromophore-binding cysteine in the GAF domain. The switch between both binding sites was, however, not difficult, as shown by mutant studies; in two different BV-binding phytochromes, Calothrix CphB (16Jorissen H.J. Quest B. Remberg A. Coursin T. Braslavsky S.E. Schaffner K. Tandeau de Marsac N. Gärtner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2662-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Agrobacterium Agp1 (this work), the introduction of a cysteine in the GAF domain was sufficient to achieve covalent PCB attachment. Each phytochrome monomer has only one chromophore pocket, as shown here by competition experiments for Agp1 (Fig. 4). Because BV binds with its ring A vinyl side chain to Cys20 of Agp1, and PCB binds with its ring A ethylidene side chain to Cys249 of Agp1-V249C, the protein must be folded in such a way that amino acid 249 comes very close to Cys20 of Agp1. It is thus obvious that both corresponding regions of the protein contribute to the same part of the chromophore pocket. Quite interestingly, a PAS domain is identified by secondary structure prediction program in the N terminus of two bacterial phytochromes, Cph1 and DrBphP (11Montgomery B.L. Lagarias J.C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The PAS-homologous part of Agp1 stretches from Pro24 to Trp82 (Fig. 1) and thus starts just behind the chromophore-binding Cys20 of Agp1. In oat phytochrome A, the PAS-homologous part covers the region around amino acid 80, which is critical for chromophore attachment (28Bhoo S.H. Hirano T. Jeong H.Y. Lee J.G. Furuya M. Song P.-S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11717-11718Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PAS domains often serve as protein/protein contact sites (29Huang Z.J. Edery I. Rosbash M. Nature. 1993; 364: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 30Zhu Y. Tepperman J.M. Fairchild C.D. Quail P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1999; 96: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), this domain mediates chromophore binding. The PAS-like domain in the N terminus of phytochromes could thus be part of the chromophore pocket. It could even be possible that in more ancient phytochromes, this domain formed a chromophore pocket by its own and that the GAF domain functioned as lyase, which catalyzes covalent chromophore attachment. The competition studies point to an interesting explanation for why the chromophore binding site could have swapped from the N terminus into the GAF domain. Although covalently bound to Agp1, BV was partially removed from the chromophore pocket by PCB. The competition by PCB was even stronger when the BV adduct was converted into the Pfr form. High levels of free bilin would thus significantly disturb the photocycle of Agp1-like phytochromes. As soon as the host cell produces PCB, as cyanobacteria do, the possibility exists to use this bilin as a phytochrome chromophore. Phycocyanobilin has the advantage that it can be bound very tightly to the protein, given that it is covalently bound to the GAF domain. Therefore, in cyanobacteria evolutionary pressure could favor PCB-binding phytochromes that have a PCB-binding cysteine in the GAF domain.

We hypothesized that hepatocytes exposed to HCV and HIV proteins might be susceptible to injury via an “innocent bystander” mechanism. To assess this, we studied the effects of envelope proteins, E2 of HCV and gp120 of HIV, in model HepG2 cells. Upon co-stimulation with HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120, we observed a potent proinflammatory response with the induction of IL-8. Furthermore, our studies revealed that HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120 act collaboratively to trigger a specific set of downstream signaling pathways that include activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and the tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2. Both specific inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase and sodium vanadate, a potent protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, blocked IL-8 production in a dose-dependent manner. The role of p38 MAP kinase and SHP2 was further defined by transiently overexpressing dominant negative mutants of these proteins into HepG2 cells. These studies revealed that overexpression of an inactive p38 MAP kinase or SHP2 mutant partially abrogated HCV-E2- and HIV-gp120-induced IL-8 production. Further studies revealed that IL-8 induction was not mediated through activation of the NF-κB pathway. However, HCV-E2 plus HIV-gp120 was shown to increase the DNA binding activity of AP-1. These results emphasize that expression of the proinflammatory chemokine IL-8, induced by HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120, may be mediated through p38 MAP kinase and SHP2 in an NF-κB-independent manner, albeit through AP-1-driven processes.

It has been shown that overall prevalence of HCV infection among HIV-infected individuals is ∼30–50%, with rates of co-infection as high as 90% in intravenous drug users and almost 100% in hemophiliacs (1Dieterich D.T.

Since the advent of antiretroviral therapy, HCV/HIV-co-infected individuals have experienced increasing HCV-related mortality and morbidity due to the increased severity of HCV-related liver disease (3Garcia-Samaniego J.

Hepatol. 1997; 26: 1-5Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). The more rapid progression of hepatic disease with co-infection is currently unexplained. It has also been shown that co-infected patients have a higher incidence of fibrosis (6Puoti M. Bonacini M. Spinetti A. Putzolu V. Govindarajan S. Zaltron S. Favret M. Callea F. Gargiulo F. Donato F.

Furthermore, a greater degree of portal, periportal, and lobular inflammation (centrilobular fibrosis, cholestasis, and granulocytic cholangiolitis) was reported in patients with HCV/HIV co-infection than with HCV alone (8Dienes H.P. Drebber U. Both I.V. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31: 43-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inflammation is characterized by the invasion of activated leukocytes into the injured tissue. This process is critically dependent upon the rapid expression of chemokines (9Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2399) Google Scholar). Direct HCV infection of hepatocytes may not be immunologically contained in the face of HIV-related immune dysfunction. However, other mechanisms may be operative, including the toxic effects of HCV and HIV proteins on uninfected cells. We hypothesize that hepatocytes exposed to HCV and HIV might be subjected to signaling effects produced by the binding of viral proteins to the cell surface, independent of cell infection and viral replication. There is a precedent for such “innocent bystander” effects, whereby viral envelope proteins can induce cell dysfunction and death by triggering specific signal transduction pathways (10Hesselgesser J.

In the present study, we have shown that the HCV envelope protein E2 and HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 act collaboratively to trigger a specific set of downstream signaling events that lead to induction of the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8). Higher expression of IL-8 could contribute to the inflammation reported in HCV/HIV co-infection. IL-8 was the first identified member of the still growing chemokine family and represents the prototype human chemokine (13Baggiolini M. Clark-Lewis I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). IL-8 synthesis, at low or undetectable levels in normal noninflamed tissue, can be induced in vivo as well as in a wide variety of cells in vitro by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 or tumor necrosis factor (14Kasahara T.

In this report, we have characterized a novel signaling pathway cooperatively activated by HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120 and mediated by p38 MAP kinase and SHP2 that may contribute to proinflammatory signals leading to IL-8 production. Materials—HCV-E2 subtype 1a and M-tropic HIV-gp120 were obtained from Immuno Diagnostics, Inc. (Woburn, MA). T-tropic HIV-gp120 derived from the HIV IIIB strain was purchased from Protein Sciences (Meriden, CT). All of the proteins were expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system and found to be highly pure and endotoxin-free. Antibodies to SHP2, p38, Grb2, Shc, and PY99 were procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) was from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA), and SB202190, SB203580, SB356095, and okadaic acid were from Calbiochem. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Escherichia coli 0111:B4), phosphonitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) and sodium orthovanadate were from Sigma. Minimum essential Eagle's medium was purchased from Invitrogen, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was from Cellgro (Herndon, VA), and the fetal calf serum was from Sigma. Cell Culture and Stimulation of Cells—Human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) were obtained from ATCC (HB-8065). Cells were cultured in ATCC medium (minimum essential Eagle's medium with 2 mml-glutamine and Earle's buffered salt solution adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.1 nm nonessential amino acids, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum) supplemented with 1% penicillin (10,000 IU/ml) and streptomycin (10,000 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a water-saturated atmosphere. Cells cultured to about 65% confluence were starved for 3 h in the serum-free medium and then stimulated with 1.5 nm HCV-E2 and 0.8 nm HIV-gp120 (i.e. 100 ng/ml of each dissolved in cell culture medium). Controls received the appropriate volume of cell culture medium. For the studies with inhibitors, SB202190, okadaic acid, N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), and lactacystin were dissolved in Me2SO and added to the culture medium 45 min prior to stimulation at various concentrations. After stimulation for the designated time, cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; 10 mm sodium vanadate; 10 mm sodium fluoride; and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Total cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad protein assay. The human microvascular endothelial cell line (HMEC-1) was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 2 mml-glutamine, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 10% fetal bovine serum) supplemented with 1% penicillin (10,000 IU/ml) and streptomycin (10,000 μg/ml) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in a water-saturated atmosphere. Cells cultured to about 65% confluence were starved for 3 h in the serum-free medium and then stimulated with LPS at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in cell culture medium. Controls received the appropriate volume of cell culture medium. After stimulation for 24 h, the supernatants were collected and used for the IL-8 assay. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—For the immunoprecipitation studies, equal amounts of protein from each sample were clarified by 50% of protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The cell lysates were incubated with specific antibodies at 4 °C for a minimum of 2 h. The immune complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific bound proteins were removed by washing the Sepharose beads three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl) and once with phosphate-buffered saline. Bound proteins were boiled with 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and the precipitated proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Using the semidry Western blotting method, the electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat milk protein in TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, and 10% Tween 20), and the blot was probed with primary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution in milk solution at 4 °C overnight. After extensive washing with TBST, the blot was incubated with secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit IgG or sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) for 2 h at room temperature. After further washing with TBST, the immunoblot was developed with the ECL system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA Constructs and Transfection Procedures—The cDNAs for SHP2 wild type and SHP2 inactive mutant in a Cldn 6368 expression vector were generously provided by Dr. Benjamin G. Neel (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA). The plasmid for the inactive protein-tyrosine phosphatase was made by mutating Cys459 of SHP2 to Ser. The p38 MAP kinase wild type and p38 MAP kinase mutant were a kind gift from Dr. Roger J. Davis (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). The plasmids, pCMV5-FLAG-p38 MAP kinase and p38 MAP kinase AGF mutant (Thr and Tyr at positions 180 and 182 of p38 MAP kinase mutated to Ala and Phe, respectively), were cloned as previously described (30Raingeaud J.

Transfection of HepG2 cells was performed with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for 48 h. Briefly, cells grown to 70% confluence in 35-mm plates were incubated with DNA (2 μg of total)-LipofectAMINE (10 μl) complexes in serum-free medium overnight. Then the cells were grown in the presence of media with 10% serum. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and starved with serum-free medium for 3 h and used for stimulation as described above. To assess transfection efficiency, cells co-transfected with pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega, Madison, WI) were processed to determine the galactosidase activity using a Promega kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. IL-8 Measurement—IL-8 secretion was measured by ELISA (Endogen, Woburn, MA). The cells grown to 65% confluence were stimulated as described above for 24 h. The supernatants collected were assayed for IL-8 using an ELISA assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. p38 in Vitro Kinase Assay—Following stimulation, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with p38 rabbit polyclonal antibody as described above. The beads were washed twice in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and once in kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4). Kinase assays were then performed using 5 μCi of [γ 32P]ATP/reaction and 2 μg of glutathione S-transferase-ATF-2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). After 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by boiling with 2× SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. In Vitro SHP2 Phosphatase Assay—After stimulation, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with SHP2 rabbit polyclonal antibody as described above. The beads were washed twice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and once with phosphatase assay buffer (100 mm sodium acetate at pH 5.0 and 1.6 mm dithiothreitol). The immunoprecipitates were incubated in phosphatase assay buffer containing 10 mm pNPP as the substrate at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.2 n sodium hydroxide. Absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured immediately at 410 nm. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Preparations of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were performed with an NE-PER™ nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent kit (Pierce). Nuclear extracts were prepared after stimulation for 20 min as described above. The double-stranded probe containing the NF-κB consensus site 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ and the AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′ from Promega were biotin-labeled using a Biotin 3′-end DNA labeling kit (Pierce). EMSA was performed using a LightShift™ chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assay—HepG2 and HMEC-1 cells were cultured in 24-well plates and grown to 70% confluence. The cells were transfected with 0.5 μg/well of pNFκB-Luc vector or pTal-Luc vector (negative control) (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) for 48 h. To assess transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega). The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and starved with serum-free medium for 3 h. Then the transfectants were stimulated with 1.5 nm HCV-E2 and 0.8 nm HIV-gp120 (i.e. 100 ng/ml each) in HepG2 cells for 20 min or with LPS (1 μg/ml) in HMEC-1 cells for 45 min. Using the luciferase reporter assay kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), the cells were lysed, and the luciferase reporter assay was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions. Chemiluminescent detection of the luciferase activity was performed with a luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was determined using a Promega kit to verify the reproducibility of the quadruplicate transfections in all experiments. Statistical Analysis—All of the experiments were reproducible and were carried out in duplicates or quadruplicates. Each set of experiments was repeated at least three times with similar results, and a representative one is shown. The results are presented as the means ± S.D. Student's t test for paired samples was used to determine statistical significance. Differences were considered statistically significant at a value of p ≤ 0.05. HCV-E2 in Conjunction with HIV-gp120 Induces IL-8 Production—Hepatic inflammation has been shown to be an important marker in HCV-infected HIV patients (31Daar E.S. Lynn H. Donfield S. Gomperts E.

Hepatology. 2001; 34: 1193-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In HCV patients with liver inflammation and fibrosis, elevated serum levels of adhesion molecules, E-selectin, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α were reported (33Kaplanski G. Farnarier C. Payan M.J. Bongrand P. Durand J.M. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1997; 42: 2277-2284Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34Masumoto T. Ohkubo K. Yamamoto K. Ninomiya T. Abe M. Akbar S.M.F. Michitaka K. Horiike N. Onji M. Hepato-Gastroenterology. 1998; 45: 1630-1634PubMed Google Scholar). Our initial studies revealed that one of the components of the HCV structural proteins, HCV-E2, slightly induced IL-8 production in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). Following these initial studies, we sought to model events in hepatocytes in hosts infected with both HCV and HIV. HIV-gp120 is known to be an important signaling molecule through its binding to the surface chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR3 (35Littman D.R. Cell. 1988; 93: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (270) Google Scholar). We observed robust expression of CXCR4 and CCR3 and lower amounts of CCR5 on both HepG2 and primary hepatocytes by using semiquantitative PCR (data not shown). We also observed low expression of CD4 in HepG2 cells by flow cytometry as well as expression of CD81 on both HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes by PCR (data not shown). We then examined the effects of T-cell tropic HIV-gp120 derived from HIV IIIB, an X4 strain that specifically binds to CXCR4 (35Littman D.R. Cell. 1988; 93: 677-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (270) Google Scholar), on HCV-E2-induced IL-8 production. HIV-gp120 enhanced the production of IL-8 from HepG2 cells in the presence of HCV-E2 (Fig. 1A). It is evident from the data that HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120 exhibit an optimal cooperativity at concentrations of 1.5 nm HCV-E2 (100 ng/ml) and 0.8 nm HIV-gp120 (100 ng/ml). Subsequently, we performed all of our experiments at these concentrations. The induction of IL-8 appeared to be specific, since we did not detect induction of MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, or tumor necrosis factor in these treated cells, as determined by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (data not shown). To assess the specificity of HIV-gp120 and the chemokine receptor CXCR4, we further analyzed the effect of macrophage cell tropic HIV-gp120 (M-gp120) derived from YU2, an R5 strain that binds to the CCR5 receptor. HepG2 cells were stimulated with HCV-E2 (1.5 nm) and T-tropic gp120 (gp120, 0.8 nm) or M-tropic gp120 (0.8 nm) either separately or in combination at these concentrations. Heat-inactivated (Δ) proteins were used in a similar fashion and served as controls for the observed effects. Fig. 1B shows the cooperative effect of HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120 on IL-8 production in comparison with untreated or HCV-E2- or HIV-gp120-treated samples. Moreover, we did not find any significant difference in the degree of IL-8 induction between the T-tropic and M-tropic HIV-gp120. Furthermore, various combinations of the heat-inactivated proteins were unable to induce IL-8 as compared with the active proteins. A similar result was obtained with primary hepatocytes (Fig. 1C). These initial data suggest that there might be an enhanced inflammatory response in hepatocytes upon simultaneous exposure to HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120. This could contribute to the clinical finding of frequent and often rapidly progressive inflammation and fibrosis in patients co-infected with these two viruses. The binding of HCV-E2 to CD81 has been well established (36Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S.

However, several studies have shown that HCV associates with low density lipoprotein (LDL), suggesting that the virus could use the LDL receptor as a receptor (39Agnello V. Abel G. Elfahal M.

Virol. 2000; 74: 10055-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Moreover, HCV-E2 has been proposed to interact with negatively charged molecules such as glycosaminoglycans (41Penin F. Combet C. Germandidis G. Frainais P.O. Deleage G. Pawlotsky J.M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5703-5710Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, the downstream signaling induced by HCV-E2 may be due to its binding with one of these receptors. However, the binding of T-tropic HIV-gp120 to CXCR4 has been well established (42Misse D. Cerutti M. Noraz N. Jourdan P. Favero J. Decauchelle G. Yssel H. Taylor N. Veas F. Blood. 1999; 93: 2454-2462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To address the role of the CXCR4 receptor in HCV-E2- and HIV-gp120-induced IL-8 production, a dose-dependent study was done with the CXCR4 inhibitor SB356095. We found a gradual block in the induction of IL-8 (13, 29, and 43%) upon increasing concentrations of SB356095 (Fig. 1D). The cells were found to be viable at these concentrations of the inhibitor. However, the inhibition was not complete, emphasizing the partial involvement of the CXCR4 receptor in the downstream signaling induced by HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120. p38 MAP Kinase Activation Contributes to the Secretion of IL-8 Induced by HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120 —It is known that members of the MAP kinase family regulate several transcription factors that are important in the proinflammatory response (43Dean J.L.E.

Okudaira H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24832-24838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). IL-8 gene expression has been shown to be dependent on different MAP kinase activators in various cell types (45Jijon H.B. Panenka W.J. Madsen K.L. Parsons H.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C31-C41Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 46Marian V. Farnarier C. Gres S. Kaplanski S. Su M.S.S. Dinarello C.A. Kaplanski G. Blood. 2001; 98: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We found that HCV-E2 or HIV-gp120 alone modestly induced p38 MAP kinase activity. However, this induction was augmented (over 3-fold) upon co-treatment with HCV-E2 and HIV-gp120 (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylation studies of p38 MAP kinase correlated well with its activity (Fig. 2, B and C, top panels). Equal amounts of p38 protein were present in each lane (Fig. 2, B and C, bottom panels). Recent studies have also shown that inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity suppresses the IL-8 gene expression, thereby regulating inflammatory response (47Na Y.J. Jeon Y.J. Suh J.H. Kang J.S.

SB202190 and SB203580, specific inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase, were used to assess the contribution of p38 MAP kinase to IL-8 production. Fig. 3 (A and B) clearly indicates that the p38 MAP kinase inhibitors significantly decreased IL-8 production in a dose-dependent manner in cells stimulated with HCV-E2 plus HIV-gp120. To further confirm the role of p38 MAP kinase in IL-8 induction, we transiently transfected HepG2 cells with either wild type or"
https://openalex.org/W1973692148,"Caliciviruses represent a family of positive strand RNA viruses responsible for a variety of syndromes in man and animals. VP10, a minor structural protein of the calicivirus rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, is encoded in the small 3′-terminal open reading frame (ORF) 2 and is translated with an efficiency of ∼20% of the preceding ORF1. The presence of the ORF1 termination codon is crucial for VP10 expression. Translation of VP10 starts at an AUG codon located at positions –5 to –3 of the ORF1 termination codon. However, VP10 was also expressed in the absence of an AUG initiation codon. The majority of ORF1 could be deleted or replaced by different sequences without significant influence on VP10 expression as long as translation terminated at the given position. The RNA sequence of the 3′-terminal 84 nucleotides of ORF1 but not the encoded peptide was found to be crucial for VP10 expression. In contrast, nearly the entire ORF2 could be replaced by a foreign sequence without abrogation of its translation. Accordingly, VP10 is expressed in a translation termination/reinitiation process that is particular because it is independent of an AUG translational start codon and requires the presence of a sequence element upstream of the initiation site.

Accordingly, VP10 is expressed in a translation termination/reinitiation process that is particular because it is independent of an AUG translational start codon and requires the presence of a sequence element upstream of the initiation site. Translation of proteins is a fundamental process in living cells. At the step of translation initiation, the decision is made regarding which RNA is translated. Thus, the initiation process represents a key point for successful gene expression and a potential site for its regulation (recently reviewed in Refs. 1Sachs A.B. Sarnow P. Hentze M.W. Cell. 1997; 89: 831-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar and 2Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells most initiation events conform to elements of the ribosomal scanning mechanism proposed by Kozak (3Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar, 4Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar). Because the small ribosomal subunit starts scanning at the 5′-terminal cap structure of the RNA and then migrates linearly in a 3′ direction, translation usually starts at the AUG codon closest to the 5′ end. In higher eukaryotes the AUG has to reside in a favorable sequence context; otherwise, at least some of the ribosomal subunits can pass by and initiate at an AUG further downstream (5Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 6Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), which can result in expression of different proteins from one mRNA (7Curran J. Richardson C.D. Kolakofsky D. J. Virol. 1986; 57: 684-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Stacey S.N. Jordan D. Williamson A.J. Brown M. Coote J.H. Arrand J.R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7284-7297Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Viruses are dependent on the biochemistry of the host cell with regard to translation. To cope with the need for a 5′ cap structure as a signal for translation initiation, viruses have developed a variety of strategies to ensure translation of the viral RNAs. Viruses like picornaviruses, hepatitis C virus, or pestiviruses use an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) 1The abbreviations used are: IRES, internal ribosomal entry site; FCV, feline calicivirus; ORF, open reading frame; RHDV, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus; uORF, upstream open reading frame; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. within the 5′ noncoding sequence of their RNA that directly binds ribosomes, circumventing the usual interaction with the 5′-terminal cap (recently reviewed in Ref. 9Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Lomakin I.B. Pilipenko E.V. Shatsky I.N. Agol V.I. Hellen C.U.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7029-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The use of alternative strategies for translation initiation allows several viruses to improve the efficiency of their gene expression by interference with the protein synthesis of the host. Moreover, regulation of viral gene expression and efficient usage of the size-limited viral genome are often achieved by a specific strategy for translation initiation. The family Caliciviridae comprises a group of rather poorly studied nonenveloped positive strand RNA viruses that are responsible for a variety of diseases in man and animals (reviewed in Ref. 10Green K.Y. Ando T. Balayan M.S. Berke T. Clarke I.N. Estes M.K. Matson D.O Nakata S. Neill J.D. Studdert M.J. Thiel H.-J. Regenmortel M.H.V. Fauquet C.M. Bishop D.H.L. Virus Taxonomy. Academic Press, New York.2000: 725-734Google Scholar). Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is the causative agent of a contagious disease of high morbidity and mortality that was first described in China in 1984 (11Liu S.X. Xue H.P. Pu B.Q. Qian N.H. Anim. Husbandry Vet. Med. 1984; 16: 253-255Google Scholar) and then spread to different countries in Europe and Asia. The virus was accidentally transferred to the mainland of Australia in 1995 and two years later also arrived in New Zealand, where it apparently had been released deliberately to kill New Zealand's rabbits (12Lawson M. Nature. 1995; 378: 531Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 13Pennisi E. Science. 1997; 277: 1441Google Scholar). The caliciviral genomes have a length of ∼7.5 kb and carry the viral protein VPg (viral protein, genome-linked), which is covalently linked to the RNA 5′ end. The viral genomic RNAs contain two or three functional open reading frames (ORFs) (reviewed in Ref. 10Green K.Y. Ando T. Balayan M.S. Berke T. Clarke I.N. Estes M.K. Matson D.O Nakata S. Neill J.D. Studdert M.J. Thiel H.-J. Regenmortel M.H.V. Fauquet C.M. Bishop D.H.L. Virus Taxonomy. Academic Press, New York.2000: 725-734Google Scholar). In the RHDV genome, one long ORF (ORF1) is present that covers ∼90% of the RNA and codes for the nonstructural proteins and VP60, the major capsid protein. Translation of ORF1 leads to a polyprotein of ∼257 kDa that is mainly processed by a viral cysteine protease (14Boniotti B. Wirblich C. Sibilia M. Meyers G. Thiel H.-J. Rossi C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6487-6495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Close to the 3′ end of the RNA, a small second ORF (ORF2) is found that overlaps ORF1 by 17 nucleotides (15Meyers G. Wirblich C. Thiel H.-J. Virology. 1991; 184: 664-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A similar 3′-terminal reading frame is also present in all other known calicivirus genomes. It was first shown for RHDV and feline calicivirus (FCV) that this frame is expressed (16Herbert T.P. Brierley I. Brown T.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Wirblich C. Thiel H.-J. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7974-7983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18König M. Thiel H.-J. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4492-4497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The translation product of the RHDV ORF2 represents a minor capsid protein of ∼10 kDa (VP10) (17Wirblich C. Thiel H.-J. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7974-7983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ORF2 is found both in the genomic RHDV RNA and in a 2.2-kb subgenomic viral RNA that is colinear with the 3′-terminal part of the genome. Calicivirus gene expression and replication are very efficient, resulting in high yields of viral RNAs, proteins, and infectious virus particles soon after infection. The underlying mechanisms are not well known. There are indications that VPg plays a crucial role in translation initiation, possibly serving as a substitute for the 5′ cap structure of regular mRNAs (20Herbert T.P. Brierley I. Brown T.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Daughenbaugh K.F. Fraser C.S. Hershey J.W. Hardy M.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2852-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Even more obscure is the mechanism leading to expression of the 3′-terminal ORF. Additional subgenomic RNAs that might serve as mRNA for the VP10 homologue of FCV were mentioned in older publications but turned out to be artifactual (22Carter M.J. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 1994; 9: 429-439PubMed Google Scholar). After in vitro translation of FCV RNA and a synthetic RNA similar to the subgenomic viral RNA, expression of the 3′-terminal ORF was observed (16Herbert T.P. Brierley I. Brown T.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Similarly, heterologous expression of RHDV RNA resulted in translation of VP10 (23Meyers G. Wirblich C. Thiel H.-J. Thumfart J.O. Virology. 2000; 276: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, it is generally accepted now that VP10 in RHDV and its homologues in other caliciviruses are translated from the genomic RNA and/or subgenomic mRNA. The present report describes experiments aiming at elucidation of the mechanism leading to expression of VP10. Cells and Viruses—BHK21 cells were kindly provided by T. Rümenapf (Justus Liebig Universität, Giessen, Germany) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (tested for the absence of viruses and mycoplasma) and nonessential amino acids. Vaccinia virus MVA-T7 (modified vaccinia virus Ankara containing the gene coding for the RNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7) (24Wyatt L.S. Moss B. Rozenblatt S. Virology. 1995; 210: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by B. Moss (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). Construction of Recombinant Plasmids—Restriction and subcloning were done according to standard procedures (25Sambrook S. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequencing was done with the Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit and an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany), Amersham Biosciences, Invitrogen, and Roche Applied Science. Plasmid pCITE-2A was purchased from Angewandte Gentechnik Systeme (Heidelberg, Germany). It contains a T7 RNA polymerase promoter followed by a picornavirus IRES and a multiple cloning site for insertion of sequences that should be expressed. The vector provides the AUG for translation initiation driven by the IRES. Plasmid pRmRNA was established by inserting the BglII/EagI fragment from pR1228 (23Meyers G. Wirblich C. Thiel H.-J. Thumfart J.O. Virology. 2000; 276: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) into pBluescript SK– (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) cut with BamHI and EagI. From the resulting plasmid an HhaI/StuI fragment was isolated and inserted into pBluescript SK– EcoRI/SmaI together with oligonucleotides Ol-RmRNA/T7+ and Ol-RmRNA/T7– that had been phosphorylated with polynucleotide kinase (25Sambrook S. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Into the resulting plasmid cut with BamHI and EagI, the BamHI/EagI fragment from the first described subclone was inserted. The oligonucleotides contained a T7 RNA polymerase promoter fused to the sequence GTGAATGTT, which was determined as the 5′ end of the RHDV subgenomic mRNA before (15Meyers G. Wirblich C. Thiel H.-J. Virology. 1991; 184: 664-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The constructs of the series pRmN5d were generated by insertion of the Npro-coding sequence amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides Ol-Npro5/Nco and Ol-Npro3/BamHI and cut with NcoI and BamHI together with the different RHDV cDNA fragments amplified with M13 reverse primer and oligonucleotides Ol-RmN5d1, Ol-RmN5d2, and Ol-RmN5d9, respectively, cut with BamHI and EagI into pCITE-2A cut with NcoI and EagI. The PCR was conducted in 35 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 54 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C) with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) using the buffer and the conditions proposed by the producer. pRmN5 was established accordingly with the exception that first the Npro coding region was inserted together with the BamHI/EagI fragment from pR1228 into pCITE-2A and later on a BamHI fragment that covered the first 32 codons of the VP60 ORF derived from a fragment amplified with oligonucleotides Ol-RmN5 and Ol-RHD16 was introduced into the initial construct cut with BamHI and dephosphorylated using calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. Constructs pRmN5d1FS, pRmN5d3FS, and pRmN5d4FS were generated by cleavage of the corresponding constructs pRmN5d1, pRmN5d3, and pRmN5d4 with BamHI, end filling with Klenow polymerase, and religation. This procedure results in a frameshift that leads to expression of Npro with carboxyl-terminal nonsense extensions of 57, 35, and 7 amino acids, respectively (translation termination occurs at stop codons located in the RHDV sequence at positions 5754–5756, 6315–6317, and 6939–6941 for pRmN5d1FS, pRmN5d3FS, and pRmN5d4FS, respectively (numbering according to the published sequence (19Meyers G. Wirblich C. Thiel H.-J. Virology. 1991; 184: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar)). Mutants pR-M3, pR-M4, pRmM6, pRmM7, and pRmM8 of pRmRNA were generated according to the method of Kunkel et al. (26Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. A R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) using single-stranded DNA of pRmRNA and oligonucleotides Ol-R/M3, Ol-R/M4, Ol-R/M6, Ol-R/M7, and Ol-R/M8, respectively. Mutants pR-M3/4 or pRmRNA-dM were obtained in two-step processes with oligonucleotides Ol-R/M4 and Ol-R/M3 or Ol-RdMet3 and Ol-RdMet4, respectively. Mutants pRmS2C and pRmS2Y were generated with oligonucleotide Ol-R-Wob-1 and subsequent identification of the desired mutants by nucleotide sequencing. Mutant pRmS2D was established by PCR with pRmRNA and primers Ol-RHD39 and Ol-R-S2D. The PCR fragment was cut with AatII and EcoRI and inserted into either pRmRNA or pRmRNA-dM, leading to pRmS2D or pRmS2D-dM. The double frameshift mutant pRm2xFS was generated in two steps of PCR-based mutagenesis. First, the nucleotide preceding AUG2 was deleted by PCR with oligonucleotides Ol-Rd7035r and Ol-RHD39. The PCR fragment was cut with EcoRI and AatII and ligated into pRmRNA restricted with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid served as a template for two PCRs with primer pairs Ol-R-plus1R/Ol-RHD39 and Ol-R-plus1/M13 reverse. The resulting PCR fragments were cut with AatII/XhoI and XhoI/SacI, respectively, and ligated into pRmRNA cut with AatII and SacI, resulting in pRm2xFS. To generate constructs pRm3N and pRm3dN, PCR was conducted with pRmRNA and primer pairs Ol-RHD39/Ol-VP10ct or Ol-RHD39/Ol-VP10nt, respectively. The PCR fragments were cut with AatII and XbaI and ligated with pRmRNA AatII/SacI together with the Npro-coding sequence amplified with Ol-Npro/nt and Ol-Npro/ct cut with XbaI and SacI. The primers were purchased from Invitrogen. The sequences are deposited as supplemental data online. Expression, Metabolic Labeling, and Immunoprecipitation of Proteins—Transient expression of plasmids in BHK-21 cells using vaccinia virus MVA-T7 was done as described (27Thumfart J.O. Meyers G. Virology. 2002; 304: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). 3–4 h after transfection the cells were washed two times with label medium containing no cysteine (cysteine labeling) or no cysteine and no methionine (cysteine and methionine labeling) and incubated in this medium for 1 h. Afterward, the medium was replaced by the appropriate labeled medium containing 0.25 mCi/ml [35S]cysteine or 0.25 mCi/ml of Tran35S-Label (ICN, Eschwege, Germany), and the cells were incubated for another 6–20 h at 37 °C. Labeled cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and frozen within the dishes. The cell extracts were prepared under denaturing conditions (17Wirblich C. Thiel H.-J. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7974-7983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extracts were incubated with 5 μl of undiluted serum. The precipitates were formed with cross-linked Staphylococcus aureus (28Kessler S.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 442-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For quantification of the expression products, a second aliquot of antiserum was added to the supernatant of the first precipitation, and residual proteins were precipitated as described above. The precipitates were combined. Analysis of the immunoprecipitated proteins was done by SDS-PAGE using Tricine-buffered gels (29Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, the gels were fixed for 1 h with an aqueous solution of 30% methanol and 10% acetic acid, rinsed for 3 h in water containing 20% methanol and 3% glycerol, vacuum-dried at 60 °C, and exposed to BioMax x-ray films (Kodak, Stuttgart, Germany). The antisera used for detection of RHDV proteins have been described extensively before (antisera V6 and V1 are equivalent to antisera M and N published in Ref. 17Wirblich C. Thiel H.-J. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7974-7983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro transcription of RNA was carried out as described (27Thumfart J.O. Meyers G. Virology. 2002; 304: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate was done as recommended (Promega). Protein Quantification—VP10 expression efficiency was quantified after SDS-PAGE separation of VP60 and VP10 precipitated with antisera V6 and V1, respectively. The gels were analyzed with a Fujifilm BAS-1500 phosphorus imager, and intensities of the signals were determined with TINA 2.0 software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). For evaluation of the expression efficiency of VP10 relative to VP60, the number of methionines and cysteines within the proteins was determined (12 methionines and one cysteine for VP60, and two methionines and no cysteines for VP10; this counting reflects that the amino-terminal methionine is lost from VP10 but not from VP60). Based on these data the molar ratios of the proteins were calculated from the measured radioactivity. For comparison of expression efficiencies of different constructs, the VP10 expression level of pRmRNA was defined as 100%. The amount of VP10 expression of the other constructs was normalized using the values determined for VP60 or Npro and Npro-VP60 as an internal standard. The corrected value for VP10 was then used for calculation of the expression efficiency given as percentage of the pRmRNA value. The data presented here represent the averages of at least three independent experiments. RNA Isolation and Northern Blot—Transfection of BHK-21 cells infected with MVA-T7 was done as described above. 5 μg of total RNA isolated 6 h post-transfection was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, transfer to Duralon membrane (Stratagene), and hybridization with a DNA probe as described before (30Meyers G. Tautz N. Dubovi E.J. Thiel H.-J. Virology. 1991; 180: 602-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A 3′-terminal 0.5-kb EcoRI/EagI fragment from pRmRNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (ICN Biochemicals, Eschwege, Germany) by nick translation (nick translation kit; Amersham Biosciences) was used as a probe. ORF2 Is Expressed in a Transient System in the Absence of Viral Nonstructural Proteins—Like several other caliciviruses RHDV can so far not be propagated in tissue culture cells. Isolated primary rabbit hepatocytes have been productively infected in culture (18König M. Thiel H.-J. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4492-4497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the system is not suitable for elaborate studies, and moreover, an RHDV infectious cDNA clone is not available. After having established a cDNA construct encompassing the complete coding region of the RHDV genome, protein expression was investigated in a transient transfection system based on vaccinia virus MVA-T7 (23Meyers G. Wirblich C. Thiel H.-J. Thumfart J.O. Virology. 2000; 276: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition to the ORF1 proteins, VP10 could also be detected. To prove that in analogy to FCV the translation of VP10 does not depend on the presence of the nonstructural proteins encoded in ORF1, the expression construct pRmRNA was established, from which an RNA colinear with the viral subgenomic mRNA up to the first nucleotides of the poly(A) tail can be transcribed from a T7 RNA polymerase promoter (Fig. 1). RNA derived from this construct codes for the viral capsid protein VP60 and also contains the 3′-terminal ORF2. Transient expression via MVA-T7 results in a capped transcript because the vaccinia virus provides the enzymatic activity that synthesizes a cap analogue at the RNA transcribed in the cytoplasm (reviewed in Ref. 31Moss B. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 2637-2671Google Scholar). Both VP60 and VP10 were identified in extracts of the transfected cells (Fig. 2A). Similarly, in vitro translation of a full-length RNA transcribed from pRmRNA resulted in detection of both proteins (Fig. 2B). The same was true when the viral sequence was expressed from another construct via the cell nucleus (not shown). In a Northern blot analysis, a major RHDV-specific RNA species of ∼3 kb and a minor band of ∼8 kb was detected in the transfected cells (Fig. 2C). The generation of two bands is probably due to the absence of a specific T7 RNA polymerase termination signal that results in incomplete termination at an as yet undefined sequence within the plasmid and partial readthrough. Importantly, RHDV RNAs smaller than the subgenomic mRNA were not found. Thus, the expression of VP10 represents an intrinsic feature of the viral mRNA and is not due, for example, to the transcription of an as yet unidentified ORF2 mRNA. This seems also true for infected hepatocytes because RNA from RHDV-infected liver tissue analyzed by Northern blots and in vitro translation studies following size fractionation gave no indication of the presence of a third viral RNA species smaller than the known subgenomic mRNA (not shown).Fig. 2Expression of VP60 and VP10 from pRmRNA. A, gel electrophoretic analysis of the products obtained after transient expression of pRmRNA and precipitation with antisera V6 and V1 that are specific for VP60 and VP10, respectively (17Wirblich C. Thiel H.-J. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7974-7983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The designations of the different proteins are given, and the positions of protein size marker bands are indicated. Cells infected with MVA-T7 served as negative control (Vacc). B, gel electrophoretic separation of proteins translated in vitro from RNA transcribed from pRmRNA after linearization with EagI (TS-pRmRNA/EagI, full-length RNA) or ApaLI (TS-pRmRNA/ApaLI, 3′-terminally truncated RNA). The latter RNA codes for a carboxyl-terminally truncated VP60 (VP60d) and cannot express VP10. C, Northern blot with total RNA of cells only infected with vaccinia virus MVA-T7 (Vacc) or infected and transfected with pRmRNA (pRmRNA). Hybridization was done with an RHDV-specific probe corresponding to the ORF2 region of the genome.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Quantification of the protein bands after transient expression allowed calculation of a molar ratio of the two proteins of ∼5:1 (VP60:VP10; average of more than 25 experiments). For FCV a ratio of 10:1 was determined after in vitro translation (16Herbert T.P. Brierley I. Brown T.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The precipitation of the proteins in our experiments was quantitative, because incubation of the supernatant of the immunoprecipitation with a further aliquot of antibody did not result in recovery of significant amounts of VP60 or VP10 (not shown). Moreover, analysis of the supernatants obtained during washing of the precipitates did not indicate considerable loss of one of the proteins. Accordingly, the result of the phosphorus imager analysis reflects the levels to which the two RHDV proteins have actually accumulated in the cells at the time of cell lysate preparation. Translation of ORF2 Starts at an AUG Located Upstream of the ORF1 Termination Codon—Two different AUG codons located at positions –17 to –15 (AUG1) or –5to –3 (AUG2) with regard to the ORF1 termination codon could be responsible for initiation of VP10 translation (Fig. 3A). Two mutant clones were established with either AUG1 or AUG2 exchanged for AGG or ACG, respectively. After transient expression, immunoprecipitation, and PAGE, the expression products were quantified. The intensity of the VP60 signal served as an internal standard for normalization of transfection efficiency. Calculation of the VP10 yields resulted in values of 87% of the wild type level for the AUG1 mutation and 28% for the AUG2 mutation. This result shows that AUG1 is not important when AUG2 is present. Nevertheless, AUG1 could be responsible for VP10 expression in the absence of AUG2. Such results were obtained for the M2 gene of human respiratory syncytial virus that is expressed by a termination/reinitiation mechanism (32Ahmadian G. Randhawa J.S. Easton A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2681-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the data published for human respiratory syncytial virus, the exchange of both AUGs in the RHDV RNA still resulted in expression of VP10 with 24% of wild type efficiency. AUG2 could be exchanged for AUC, resulting in similar VP10 expression levels as found for the ACG mutant. In contrast, replacement of AUG2 by UGU reduced VP10 expression to nearly zero (not shown). Taken together, AUG1 has virtually no influence on VP10 expression, whereas AUG2 is important for VP10 expression but can be replaced by alternative initiation codons. This conclusion is in agreement with the fact that AUG2 but not AUG1 is conserved in the genome of European brown hare syndrome virus, a second member of the genus Lagovirus in the family Caliciviridae. The results obtained with the mutants affecting the putative translational start codons raised the question of whether VP10 starts with the methionine encoded by AUG2. Therefore, the two internal AUG codons of ORF2 were changed by mutation to obtain a VP10-coding sequence with the AUG2 as the only position that could be labeled with a 35S-labeled amino acid. After translation of this construct, VP10 could not be detected by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B), although the protein was expressed as shown by a Western blot analysis (data not shown). To get more data on the amino terminus of VP10, the codon following AUG2 was exchanged for a cysteine codon (mutant pRmS2C). In contrast to wild type VP10 (not shown) and to mutant pRmS2Y, which do not contain cysteine, the protein translated from pRmS2C was detected after [35S]cysteine labeling (Fig. 3B). If translation of ORF2 started at AUG2, the amino-terminal methionine residue of VP10 should be lost post-translationally, because it is followed by serine. According to the Sherman rules, the Met residue should be retained when the second amino acid was changed to aspartic acid, for example (33Moerschell R.P. Hosokawa Y. Tsunasawa S. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; : 19638-19643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a mutant was established in either the wild type sequence context (construct pRmS2D) or the ORF2 sequence depleted of the two internal AUG codons (pRmS2D-dM). After expression of these constructs, radiolabeled VP10 could be detected in both cases (Fig. 3B). Similar mean VP10 expression rates were determined for pRmS2D and pRmS2D-dM when the different numbers of labeled residues in VP10 were considered. Equivalent results were also obtained for mutants expressing proteins with tyrosine or phenylalanine following the methionine encoded by AUG2 (not shown). In comparison with pRmRNA, considerably reduced amounts of VP10 were detected for all of the mutants. This is most likely not due to reduced binding of the antibodies because the changed region was not part of the fusion protein used for antiserum production, and antibody binding was carried out with denatured protein.

https://openalex.org/W2006042282,"Recent studies have reported that the activity of the calcium-dependent protease calpain is increased in acute inflammatory processes of the cardiovascular system. Because diabetes is associated with vascular inflammation, we hypothesized that increased calpain activity in response to hyperglycemia may play a role in diabetic cardiovascular disease. The effects of calpain inhibition on leukocyte-endothelium interactions induced by hyperglycemia were examined by intravital microscopy. Intraperitoneal administration of the selective calpain inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-leucinal (5 micromol/L) prevented the up-regulation of leukocyte-endothelium interactions in response to 25 mmol/L D-glucose via a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, treatment of rats with D-glucose significantly decreased basal endothelial NO release in mesenteric post-capillary venules, a phenomenon prevented by inhibition of calpain activity. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that glucose induces loss of NO via a calpain-dependent decrease in the association of hsp90 with endothelial nitric oxide synthase. In addition, inhibition of calpain activity decreased endothelial cell surface expression of the pro-inflammatory adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 during hyperglycemia. These data demonstrate that calpains contribute to important inflammatory events during hyperglycemia and that pharmacological inhibition of calpain activity attenuates leukocyte-endothelium interactions and preserves eNOS function."
https://openalex.org/W2142835688,"The growth inhibitory cytokine TGF-β enforces homeostasis of epithelia by activating processes such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Id2 expression is often highest in proliferating epithelial cells and declines during differentiation. Recently, Id2 expression has been found to depend on Myc-Max transcriptional complexes. We observed that TGF-β signaling inhibits Id2 expression in human and mouse epithelial cell lines from different tissue origins. Furthermore, the observed Id2 down-regulation by TGF-β in mouse mammary epithelial cells occurs without a concurrent drop in c-Myc levels. However, sustained Id2 repression in these cells and in human keratinocytes coincides with induction of the Myc antagonistic repressors Mad2 and Mad4, decreased formation of Myc-Max heterodimers and the replacement of Myc-Max complexes with Mad-Max complexes on the Id2 promoter. These results argue that induction of Mad expression and Id2 down-regulation are important events during the TGF-β cytostatic program in epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1580286725,"We have reported previously that levels of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) are elevated in the blood and ascites from patients with ovarian cancer. LPA stimulates proliferation of ovarian cancer cells and has been proposed as an autocrine growth factor. Here, we show that a novel autocrine loop of LPA promotes the migration of ovarian cancer cells, which is a critical step of tumor metastasis. We report that laminin, but not other extracellular matrix proteins, induces LPA production in ovarian cancer cells. A neutralizing antibody against beta1 integrin and a calcium-independent phospholipase A2-specific inhibitor, HELSS, block both LPA production and the haptotactic activity of laminin. Exogenously added LPA restores the migratory ability of HEY ovarian cancer cells to laminin. These data suggest that laminin-induced cell migration is mediated by LPA. We further show that a specific receptor for LPA, LPA3, is required for mediating the chemotactic activity of LPA. In addition, we show that cytosolic PLA2 is required for cell migration and its activation is phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-dependent. These findings have revealed a new mechanism of crosstalk between a beta1 integrin receptor and a G protein-coupled receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2050612606,"Defective calcium (Ca2+) signaling and impaired contractile function have been observed in skeletal muscle secondary to impaired myocardial function. However, the molecular basis for these muscle defects have not been identified. In this study, we evaluated the alterations of the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channels (RyR1) by analyzing global and local Ca2+ signaling in a rat postmyocardial infarction (PMI) model of myocardial overload. Ca2+ transients, measured with multiphoton imaging in individual fibers within a whole extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle, exhibited significantly reduced amplitude and a prolonged time course in PMI. Spatio-temporal properties of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks in fibers isolated from PMI EDL muscles were also significantly altered. In addition, RyR1 from PMI skeletal muscles were PKA-hyperphosphorylated and depleted of the FK506 binding protein (FKBP12). These data show that PMI skeletal muscles exhibit altered local Ca2+ signaling, associated with hyperphosphorylation of RyR1. The observed changes in Ca2+ signaling may contribute to defective excitation-contraction coupling in muscle that can contribute to the reduced exercise capacity in PMI, out of proportion to the degree of cardiac dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1976707492,"Several genetic vaccines encoding antigen chimeras containing the lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP) translocon, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domain sequences have elicited strong mouse antigen-specific immune responses. The increased immune response is attributed to trafficking of the antigen chimera to the major histocompatibility class II (MHC II) compartment where LAMP is colocalized with MHC II. In this report, we describe a new form of an HIV-1 p55gag DNA vaccine, with the gag sequence incorporated into the complete LAMP cDNA sequence. Gag encoded with the translocon, transmembrane and cytoplasmic lysosomal membrane targeting sequences of LAMP, without the luminal domain, was poorly expressed, did not traffic to lysosomes or MHC II compartments of transfected cells, and elicited a limited immune response from DNA immunized mice. In contrast, addition of the LAMP luminal domain sequence to the construct resulted in a high level of expression of the LAMP/Gag protein chimera in transfected cells that was further increased by including the inverted terminal repeat sequences of the adeno-associated virus to the plasmid vector. This LAMP/Gag chimera with the complete LAMP protein colocalized with endogenous MHC II of transfected cells and elicited strong cellular and humoral immune responses of immunized mice as compared with the response to DNA-encoding native Gag, with a 10-fold increase in CD4+ responses, a 4- to 5-fold increase in CD8+ T-cell responses, and antibody titers of >100,000. These results reveal novel roles of the LAMP luminal domain as a determinant of Gag protein expression, lysosomal trafficking, and possibly of the immune response to Gag.

In general, antibody class switching, clonal expansion of antigen-specific B cells, T cell expansion and memory cell formation, and many other functions of the immune response require the costimulatory signals and cytokines released by antigen-activated CD4+ T cells (reviewed in Ref. 4Kaech S.M.

Efficient priming of CD4+ T-cells by DNA vaccination requires sufficient levels of antigen expression in transfected cells and delivery of the protein antigen to the MHC II antigen-processing pathway. This may be facilitated by direct transfection of dendritic cells, a key event in the function of DNA vaccines (5Raz E. Carson D.A. Parker S.E. Parr T.B. Abai A.M. Aichinger G. Gromkowski S.H.

Antigens presented by MHC II molecules to helper CD4+ T-cells are derived mainly from extracellular “foreign” proteins taken into dendritic cells by endocytic receptors (reviewed in Refs. 13Robinson J.H.

Our rationale is that the delivery of antigen to the cellular site of MHC II processing and binding of antigen epitopes could result in an enhanced immune response through greater antigen-specific activation of CD4+ T-cells.

The application of LAMP to genetic vaccines has been tested with several recombinant protein antigens constructed as chimeras containing the LAMP cytoplasmic domain YXXØ targeting sequence.

The initial construct corresponded to the LAMP/antigen chimera containing the LAMP translocon, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains, but lacking the luminal domain (Gag/lamp), that was previously successfully used with several DNA-encoded antigens. It was found, however, that the majority of the Gag/lamp chimera did not traffic to the lysosome or MHC II compartments of transfected cells, despite the presence of the LAMP cytoplasmic YQTI targeting sequence. Also, the Gag/lamp chimera did not elicit an appropriately enhanced immune response when injected into mice. These problems were overcome by including the LAMP luminal domain in the construct, thus placing Gag within the lumen of the complete LAMP molecule, proximal to the transmembrane domain (LAMP/Gag). In this case, the LAMP/Gag chimera protein trafficked to the MHC II compartment and application of this construct as a DNA vaccine resulted in enhanced immune responses by immunized mice, as shown herein, and in ongoing studies with non-human primates (data not shown). Additionally, there was a novel finding that this DNA elicited a high level expression of unmodified Gag protein by transfected cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Eukaryotic expression plasmids were constructed using nucleotides 1–1503 of the HIV-1 HXB2 p55gag gene (GenBank™ accession number K03455) inserted in two vectors, pcDNA3.1 (see Fig. 1A, plasmids 1–5) (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and pITR (65Kessler P.D. Podsakoff G.M. Chen X. McQuiston S.A. Colosi P.C. Matelis L.A. Kurtzman G.J. Byrne B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The plasmids shown in this study and as labeled in Fig. 1 (see below) are: plasmid 1, pcDNA3.1 gag N and plasmid 6, pITR gag N, which are the native gag sequence inserted into NheI and KpnI sites of pcDNA3.1 and pITR vectors; plasmid 2, SS/gag N/lamp: this construct has an open reading frame of 1695 bp. The 5′ 72 bp encode the endoplasmic reticulum translocation signal from the mouse LAMP (SS), and an XhoI site at the 3′-end links the gag N gene adjoined by an EcoRI site to 108 nucleotides encoding the mouse LAMP transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (lamp) (GenBank™ J03881); plasmid 3, gag ΔINS: this pcDNA3.1 vector encodes a mutated HXB2 p55 Gag where the inhibitory sequences were deleted by use of several site-specific silent mutations (61Qiu J.T. Song R. Dettenhofer M. Tian C. August T. Felber B.K. Pavlakis G.N. Yu X.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9145-9152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid was a gift from Dr. G. N. Pavlakis from the National Institutes of Health; plasmid 4, pcDNA3.1 SS/gag ΔINS/lamp and plasmid 7, pITR SS/gag ΔINS/lamp: these constructs encode the SS at the 5′-end and a XhoI site at the 3′-end that links the gag ΔINS gene adjoined by an EcoRI site to 108 nucleotides encoding the LAMP transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (lamp); plasmid 5, pcDNA3.1 LAMP/gag N and plasmid 8, pITR LAMP/gag N: these plasmids have an open reading frame of 2736 bp, inserted into NheI and KpnI sites. They contain 1113 bp encoding the complete LAMP luminal domain, including the SS, linked to gag N at the 3′-end by XhoI and gag N adjoined to LAMP transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains by EcoRI. The plasmids used for vaccination were produced in Escherichia coli and made endotoxin-free (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).Analysis of Protein Expression—Monkey (COS-7), human (293), and murine (NIH/3T3) cells were plated in 6-well plates (2 × 106 cells/well) and transfected with plasmid DNA (4 μg) using the FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) transfection reagents according to each manufacturer's instructions. The cells were harvested 48–72 h post-transfection and disrupted with lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, premixed protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany)), for 15 min on ice, and then cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (66Marques Jr., E.T. Weiss J.B. Strand M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 93: 237-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by BCA (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Samples were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and then blocked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% nonfat dried milk. After washing with PBS-Tween (0.05%), the blot was probed with mouse anti-Gag (Dr. James Hildreth, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD) at 1:50 dilution for 2 h, washed three times, and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc, West Grove, PA) at a 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h. Gag was visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Images were digitally scanned and exported to Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe, San Jose, CA).Evaluation of LAMP Targeting by Confocal Microscopy—MHC II (I-Ek)-expressing cells (DCEK.ICAM.Hi7, gift from Dr. Susan Swain, The Trudeau Institute, Saranac Lake, NY) (67Dubey C.

The cells were transfected with the DNA plasmids using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen), and 24–48 h later they were stained to evaluate cellular localization. Coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min and washed with PBS then blocked with PBS containing 4% normal goat serum and 0.1% saponin. Endogenous LAMP was detected with rat anti-mouse LAMP-1 (1D4B) and rat anti-mouse LAMP-2 (ABL93) (15Chen J.W. Murphy T.L. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. August J.T. J.

After washing three times with 0.1% saponin in PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with Texas Red-labeled goat anti-rat IgG (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) at a 1:500 dilution. For detection of Gag expression, the cells were incubated for 1 h with mouse anti-Gag monoclonal antibody at a 1:50 dilution. After washing three times with 0.1% saponin in PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with Texas Red-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (BD Pharmingen) at a 1:500 dilution. Colocalization of LAMP-1, LAMP-2, the different forms of Gag, and the LAMP/GagN chimera with MHC II of transfected DCEK cells was performed by double immunostaining, first for the LAMP or LAMP/GagN chimera proteins as described above and then with anti-MHC II, by incubating the cells for 1 h with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse I-Ek (14-4-4S) (BD Pharmingen) at a 1:75 dilution. The cells were then washed three times with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Wallac confocal laser scanning microscope. Colocalization of the proteins with MHC II was thus determined by merging fluorophore images individually captured and digitally colored by use of Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe).Antibody Responses of Vaccinated Mice—BALB/c mice (Charles Rivers, Wilmington, MA), 6–8 weeks old, were immunized intramuscularly with 50 μg of the specified plasmid. The mice were immunized four times at 3-week intervals with the same protocol. Blood was collected by tail bleeding 9 days after the second immunization and at day 94 after four immunizations and centrifuged to remove cells, and the serum was collected and stored at 4 °C for immediate use. HIVIIIB lysate (ABI, Rockville, MD) was diluted in 0.1 m sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.4 (Pierce) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml, and 50 μl of the solution was added to each well of a 96-well plate (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the solution was removed and the plates were washed six times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 wash buffer. The plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 200 μl of blocking buffer (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% fetal bovine serum) and then washed three times. Serum samples were prepared in eight (3-fold) serial dilutions in blocking buffer starting at 1:100. 100 μl of each dilution was added to the blocked plate, and the plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. For IgG detection, the reaction was developed using goat anti-mouse anti-IgG-horseradish peroxidase (Cappel, Durham, NC) at a 1:5000 dilution. For IgG1 and IgG2a, biotinylated anti-mouse anti-IgG1 and IgG2a antibody (BD Pharmingen) diluted 1:500 was conjugated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (BD Pharmingen) diluted 1000-fold, and 100 μl was added to each well for 2 h at 37 °C. Turbo tetramethylbenzone substrate solution (BD Pharmingen) was added to each well and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 1 m sulfuric acid, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured in a Bio-Rad model 3550 microplate reader.Preparation of Splenocytes for T-cell-mediated Immune Responses— Single cell suspensions, depleted of red blood cells (RBC), were prepared from freshly isolated splenocytes in culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% v/v fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm L-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 m HEPES buffer). Splenocytes were counted and suspended at a concentration of 10 × 106 cells/ml of the culture medium for T cell-mediated assays. When indicated, splenocytes were preincubated with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 (Southern Biotechnologies, Birmingham, AL, 20 μ"

Disruption of ygdP, apaH individually, and disruption of both genes together reduced intracellular invasion of human HEp-2 epithelial cells by S. Typhimurium by 9-, 250-, and 3000-fold, respectively. Adhesion of the mutants was also greatly reduced compared with the wild type. Invasive capacity of both single mutants was restored by transcomplementation with the ygdP gene, suggesting that loss of invasion was due to increased intracellular Np n N. The normal level of 3 μm adenylated Np n N (Ap n N) was increased 1.5-, 3.5-, and 10-fold in the ygdP, apaH and double mutants, respectively. Expression of the putative ptsP virulence gene downstream of ygdP was not affected in the ygdP mutant. Analysis of 19 metabolic enzyme activities and the ability to use a range of carbohydrate carbon sources revealed a number of differences between the mutants and wild type.

Deletion of the E. coli apaH gene leads to a 10 to 100-fold increase in intracellular Ap4N (15Lévêque F. Blanchin-Roland S. Fayat G. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Mol.

The IalA protein from the invasive pathogen Bartonella bacilliformis is a member of the Nudix (nucleoside diphosphate linked to X) hydrolase family and hydrolyzes Ap4A asymmetrically to AMP and ATP and Ap5A to ADP and ATP (17Conyers G.B.

Commun. 1999; 256: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is closely related to the eukaryotic Ap4A hydrolases, particularly those from plants, which also hydrolyze many Np n N species, where n ≥ 4 (12Guranowski A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 117-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 18Cartwright J.L. Britton P. Minnick M.F. McLennan A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The ialA gene has been implicated indirectly in the process of cellular invasion by this bacterium; expression of B. bacilliformis ialA in non-invasive E. coli renders it invasive (19Mitchell S.J. Minnick M.F. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1552-1562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the orthologous ygdP gene from E. coli K1 may be required for the invasion of human brain microvascular endothelial cells as its expression is up-regulated by invasion-enhancing growth conditions and down-regulated by invasion-repressing conditions (20Badger J.L. Wass C.A. Kim K.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). YgdP and the related InvA protein from Rickettsia prowazekii preferentially hydrolyze Ap5A (21Bessman M.J. Walsh J.D. Dunn C.A. Swaminathan J. Weldon J.E. Shen J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37834-37838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gaywee J. Xu W. Radulovic S. Bessman M.J. Azad A.F. Mol. Cell. Proteom. 2002; 1: 179-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the intracellular levels of several Ap n N species are known to increase substantially under conditions of oxidative stress (23Bochner B.R. Lee P.C. Wilson S.W. Cutler C.W. Ames B.N. Cell. 1984; 37: 225-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 24Lee P.C. Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6827-6834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we previously suggested that the ability to metabolize Np n N may be necessary for invasion in the face of an oxidative attack by the invaded cell (18Cartwright J.L. Britton P. Minnick M.F. McLennan A.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). If that were so, then the apaH gene would be expected to be essential for invasion as well. Indeed, a DNA fragment from the oral pathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans that confers an invasive ability on E. coli contains the apaH gene (25Saarela M. Asikainen S. Alaluusua S. Fives-Taylor P. Anaerobe. 1998; 4: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We have, therefore, examined the effects of deleting the ygdP and apaH genes both singly and doubly on the invasive ability of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), a facultative intracellular parasite that can invade and multiply within various cell types, including phagocytes and epithelial cells, and so establish a chronic infection. Our results provide the first direct evidence of the involvement of these bacterial genes in intracellular invasion. Reagents, Bacterial Strains, and Plasmids—Recombinant human Ap4A hydrolase was prepared as described for the Caenorhabditis elegans enzyme (26Abdelghany H.M. Gasmi L. Cartwright J.L. Bailey S.

(28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of ApaH and YgdP—The coding regions of the apaH and ygdP genes were PCR-amplified from S. Typhimurium genomic DNA. ApaH was amplified using the 5′ primer (5′-ATTATACATATGGCAACTTATCTCATC-3′) containing an NdeI site and the 3′ primer (5′-TTTCGGGATCCTGGAGCGTC-3′) containing a BamHI site and inserted after restriction digestion between the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET15b (Novagen) to give pET-ApaH. YgdP was amplified using the 5′ primer (5′-AAGGTTTATCCATGGGTAGTCCGGTG-3′) containing an NcoI site and the 3′ primer (5′-AATATTCAGCGCCTCGAGCAGAC-3′) containing a XhoI site and inserted after restriction digestion between the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET32b (Novagen) to give pET-YgdP. For expression, plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The His-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed and purified on NiCAM™-HC resin (Sigma) as described previously (29AbdelRaheim, S., and McLennan, A. G. (2002) BMC Biochemistry http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2091/3/5.Google Scholar). Construction of apaH and ygdP Disruption Cassettes—Gene disruption cassettes were generated by PCR according to Wach et al. (30Wach A. Brachat A. Pöhlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). An apaH::kan cassette was constructed as follows. First, a 300-bp 5′ segment of the apaH gene was amplified from S. Typhimurium genomic DNA using the 5′ primer HP1 (5′-TCCCCCGGGATGAACGTTACGTTTTTGC-3′) and the 3′ primer HP2K (5′-TGCAGGTCGACGGATCCGGCGATCAGTTCGTCGTAG-3′), where HP1 corresponds to part of the 5′ non-coding region of apaH and HP2K contains the 5′ end of the coding region of apaH and the 5′ end of the non-coding region of the kanamycin resistance gene from pUC4K. A 285-bp 3′ segment of the apaH gene was also amplified using the 5′ primer HP3K (5′-GCTCGATGAGTTTTTCTAATGCGCTGGGAAGATAAACAG-3′) and the 3′ primer HP4 (5′-CATGTCTAGACGCAGAATTCTCACAGCTATTG-3′), where HP3K contains the 3′ end of the coding region of apaH and the 3′ end of the non-coding region of the kanamycin-resistance gene and HP4 corresponds to part of the 3′ non-coding region of apaH. In the second step, the complete kanamycin resistance gene was amplified from pUC4K using HP1, HP4, and the two PCR products from the first step as primers to give the apaH::kan cassette in which the kanamycin resistance gene is flanked by >250 bp segments of the apaH gene. A ygdP::kan disruption cassette was produced in a similar manner using primers YP1 (5′-CATGTCTAGACTTAGATGTGATGCTGGTCA-3′), YP2K (5′-TGCAGGTCGACGGATC ATCATCAATCACCGGAC-3′), YP3K (5′-GCTCGATGAGTTTTTCTAAGCTCAG GATAATCC-3′), and YP4 (5′-CATGTCTAGAATGATCGGCACACCGAG-3′). Finally, an apaH::cat cassette containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene from pLysS was produced using the primers HP1, HP2C (5′-GGGACACCAGGATTTATGGCGATCAGTTCGTCGTAG-3′), HP3C (5′-GTGGCAGGGCGGGGCGTAATGCGCTGGGAAGATAAACAG-3′), and HP4. Construction of Single and Double apaH and ygdP Deletion Mutants of S. Typhimurium—ApaH::kan and ygdP::kan disruption cassettes were first cloned into the pGEM®-T Easy vector (Promega) to give plasmids pGEM-AK and pGEM-YK respectively and the plasmids transformed into TOP10 E. coli for propagation. Recovered plasmids were digested with ApaI and SpeI and the cassettes purified after gel electrophoresis using a Qiagen purification kit. Cassettes were then ligated into the cut suicide vector pMRS101 (31Sarker M.R. Cornelis G.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 409-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli K12 CC118 (λpir) and the resulting plasmids, pTI201 and pTI202, electroporated into S. Typhimurium LT2. The transformants were isolated on LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and subcultured again on LB medium containing 10% sucrose to select deletants resulting from a double crossover event. Surviving colonies were then subcultured again on kanamycin-containing medium to give strains STYA201 (ΔapaH::kan) and STYY202 (ΔygdP::kan). The apaH::cat chloramphenicol disruption cassette was cloned into pGEM®-T Easy in a similar manner to give pGEM-AC then transferred to pMRS101 to give pTI203, which was introduced into STYY202. Colonies of the ΔapaH::cat ΔygdP::kan double mutant STYAY203 were selected as above on sucrose and on medium containing 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. All deletions were confirmed by PCR analysis of three independent isolates. Construction of Expression Plasmids for Complementation—The apaH gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using Taq polymerase and the 5′ primer (5′-ATGGCAACTTATCTCATCGGCGAC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-CATGTCTAGACGCAGAATTCTCACAGCTATTG-3′) and the ygdP gene using the 5′ primer (5′-GGTAGTCCGGTGATTGATGACGATG-3′) and the 3′ primer (5′-TCGACTATTTCGCGCAGGCGAGTG-3′). Both PCR products were cloned into the pTrcHis2-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and propagated in TOP10 E. coli to yield the plasmids pTrc-ApaH and pTrc-YgdP. Purified plasmids were then electroporated into S. Typhimurium strains STYA201 and STYY202 and transformants selected on LB agar plates containing 75 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Invasion and Adhesion Assays—HEp-2 epithelial cells and U937 macrophage-like cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 0.15% Na2HCO3. HEp-2 cells were seeded on coverslips in vials at 1 × 105 cells/coverslip and grown overnight at 37 °C in 1 ml of medium. U937 cells were split into 1-ml cultures at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml on the day of use. After inoculation with 50 μl of overnight bacterial cultures (4 × 109/ml), cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 for 3 h. For invasion assays, cells were incubated for 1 h with 25 μg/ml gentamicin, washed five times with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed in 0.5 ml 0.5% sodium deoxycholate. Lysates were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and the viable count determined on LB agar plates (containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin for mutants). For adhesion assays, incubation with gentamicin was omitted. In addition, HEp-2 monolayers were washed with phosphate-buffered saline after adhesion, fixed with methanol, and stained with a 10% solution of Giemsa prior to examination by light microscopy. Metabolic Phenotype—Nineteen different enzyme activities of the wild type (WT) S. Typhimurium and its apaH, ygdP, and apaH ygdP double null mutants were examined using the API ZYM kit (bioMérieux, Basingstoke, UK). The ability of the WT and mutant strains to metabolize a variety of different carbohydrates was determined by using the API 50 CH system (bioMérieux). This system tests assimilation, oxidation, and fermentation of the carbohydrate sources. Extraction and Assay of ApnN—Cells from 50-ml cultures of S. Typhimurium (WT and mutants) in mid log phase (OD 0.6–0.7) were collected by rapid centrifugation (5000 × g for 5 min). Pellets were resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold 0.4 m trichloroacetic acid and shaken for 15 min. Neutralization, alkaline phosphatase digestion, and purification of the dinucleotide-containing fraction were as described previously (32Murphy G.A. Halliday D. McLennan A.G. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2342-2344PubMed Google Scholar). The freeze-dried extract was dissolved in 0.1 ml 30 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.7, 5 mm magnesium acetate and triplicate 25-μl samples each mixed with 25 μl of luciferin/luciferase ATP-monitoring reagent (Bio-Orbit). After measuring the background luminescence, 1 ng of recombinant human Ap4A hydrolase was added to generate ATP and the increase in luminescence determined. This generalized assay measures all ATP-generating nucleotides of the form Ap n N, where n ≥ 4. Samples (10 μl) of the neutralized acid extract were also retained for luminometric ATP determination before alkaline phosphatase digestion. These were mixed with 90 μl of 30 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.7, 5 mm magnesium acetate, and triplicate 25-μl samples then each added to 25 μl of luciferin/luciferase ATP-monitoring reagent and the luminescence determined. Previous ATP determinations had revealed no significant differences in intracellular ATP between any of the strains (values ± S.E. were 10.1 ± 1.5, 9.5 ± 0.6, 10.9 ± 1.6, and 9.7 ± 1.3 nmol/mg of protein (n = 3) in wild type LT, STYA201, STYY202, and STYAY203, respectively). Therefore, the ATP content of the extracts acts as an internal standard for the extraction process. The intracellular concentration of Ap n N (n ≥ 4) was then estimated from the Ap n N/ATP ratio making the following assumptions: (i) that, for all strains, the intracellular ATP concentration is 3 mm (33Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9759-9769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) that Ap n A is 50% of the Ap n N pool (34Plateau P. Fromant M. Kepes F. Blanquet S. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); (iii) that the human Ap4A hydrolase used in the assay cleaves equally efficiently at either end of each Ap n N and so 1 mol of Ap n A yields 1 mol of ATP, while 1 mol of Ap n N yields 0.5 mol of ATP. The latter two assumptions require the figure for Ap n N concentration to be multiplied by 1.33 to compensate for the 50% efficiency in ATP production from Ap n N (N ≠ A). Assay of ApaH and YgdP Activity—Activity of YgdP with Ap4A, Ap5A, and Ap6A was measured luminometrically by direct continuous assay of the ATP product and kinetic parameters determined by non-linear regression analysis (26Abdelghany H.M. Gasmi L. Cartwright J.L. Bailey S. Rafferty J.B. McLennan A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1550: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Activity of ApaH with Ap5A was measured in the same way, while activity with Ap4A required the inclusion of 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 5 μg of pyruvate kinase in the assay to convert the ADP product to ATP (35Prescott M. Thorne N.M.H. Milne A.D. McLennan A.G. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, all ApaH assays contained 100 μm CoCl2 (10Plateau P. Fromant M. Brevet A. Gesquière A. Blanquet S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Guranowski A. Jakubowski H. Holler E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Product identification was by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (26Abdelghany H.M. Gasmi L. Cartwright J.L. Bailey S. Rafferty J.B. McLennan A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1550: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR—Expression of the ptsP gene in WT and mutant strains was determined by reverse transcription-PCR. Total S. Typhimurium RNA (1 μg, DNase-treated) was incubated at 70 °C for 5 min with 20 pmol of reverse primer (5′-CGCGACCAGAATAAAACGTTCC-3′) in 11 μl of water, then incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in a final volume of 19 μl containing 4 μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus buffer (MBI Fermentas), 1 mm concentration of each dNTP, and 20 units RNase inhibitor. First strand cDNA was synthesized by adding 1 μl (200 units) of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MBI Fermentas) and incubating at 42 °C for 60 min. One μl of this was amplified in a final volume of 20 μl containing 20 pmol of forward (5′-GATCATTCAGCGTCGCCAAC-3′) and reverse primers, 0.1 mm concentration of each dNTP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, and 2 μl of Taq buffer (MBI Fermentas). Properties of the ApaH and YgdP Proteins—To confirm that the S. Typhimurium ApaH and YgdP proteins had the enzymic activities predicted from their sequences, they were cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells: ApaH in pET15b as a His-tagged 33.6-kDa protein and YgdP in pET32b as a His-tagged thioredoxin fusion protein of total mass 39.2 kDa. When purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1A), the enzymes had the expected activities. ApaH efficiently hydrolyzed Ap4A, Ap5A, and Ap6A, always producing ADP as one product, while YgdP hydrolyzed the same nucleotides, with a preference for Ap5A, like the E. coli and R. prowazekii enzymes (21Bessman M.J.

Azad A.F. Mol. Cell. Proteom. 2002; 1: 179-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and always producing ATP as one product. Both enzymes followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with all substrates tested; representative plots for the hydrolysis of Ap4A by both enzymes are shown in Fig. 1B. Kinetic constants were calculated by non-linear regression. Km and k cat values for ApaH for Ap4A and Ap5A were 37 μm and 37 s–1 and 14 μm and 33 s–1, respectively, similar to the E. coli enzyme when assayed under the same conditions (10Plateau P. Fromant M. Brevet A. Gesquière A. Blanquet S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 11Guranowski A. Jakubowski H. Holler E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Km and k cat values for YgdP for Ap4A, Ap5A, and Ap6A were 18 μm and 18 s–1, 22 μm and 32 s–1, and 54 μm and 0.8 s–1, respectively. ApaH, YgdP, and ApnN in WT and Mutant Cells—ΔapaH (STYA201) and ΔygdP (STYY202) null mutants and a ΔapaH ΔygdP double null mutant (STYAY203) were generated by replacement of the genes with antibiotic resistance cassettes (Table I). Gene deletion was confirmed by PCR and by measurement of Ap4A hydrolytic activities in cell extracts. ApaH and YgdP have predicted pI values of 4.8 and 10.0, respectively. Thus, they can be measured independently after separation by batch anion-exchange chromatography at pH 7.5. Table II confirms the absence of the enzymes in the appropriate mutants. The total concentration of nucleotides of general structure Ap n N(n ≥ 4) was also measured using a luciferase-based assay in which human Ap4A hydrolase is used to generate ATP from Ap n N (n ≥ 4) compounds. WT cells had 3.6 μm Ap n N, which compares favorably with previous figures of 3 μm in both S. Typhimurium (23Bochner B.R. Lee P.C. Wilson S.W. Cutler C.W. Ames B.N. Cell. 1984; 37: 225-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and E. coli (15Lévêque F. Blanchin-Roland S. Fayat G. Plateau P. Blanquet S. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Deletion of ygdP led to a slight, 1.5-fold increase in Ap n N and deletion of apaH to a 3.5-fold increase, while deletion of both genes led to a 10-fold increase. These results show that both YgdP and ApaH contribute to control of the Ap n N pool in S. Typhimurium. As non-adenylated Np n N, which are not detected by the assay, are also substrates for these two hydrolases, it is likely that their levels also increase. Hence the Ap n N pool measurements provide a rough indication of the effects of deleting the hydrolase genes but do not yet convey the detailed picture.Table IIApaH, YgdP, and ApnN in cell extractsStrainApaH activityYgdP activityApnNunits/mg proteinunits/mg proteinμ mWT7.17.53.6 ± 0.4STYY202 (ΔygdP)6.205.1 ± 0.3STYA201 (ΔapaH)06.312.6 ± 1.2STYAY203 (ΔapaH ΔygdP)0034.0 ± 1.6 Open table in a new tab Invasion—The ability of the mutants to invade HEp-2 epithelial cells was determined using a gentamicin protection assay (36Fletcher J.N. Embaye H.E. Getty B. Batt R.M. Hart C.A. Saunders J.R. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of ygdP (STYY202) reduced invasion by 9-fold compared with the WT, while deletion of apaH (STYA201) reduced invasion by 250-fold. Deletion of both genes (STYAY203) produced a dramatic 3000-fold reduction (Fig. 2). Importantly, transformation of both STYY202 and STYA201 with the YgdP expression plasmid pTrc-YgdP restored full invasive capacity. This strongly suggests that loss of invasion is primarily related to a common property of YgdP and ApaH, i.e. the hydrolysis of Np n N, rather than to some protein-specific function. Transcomplementation of apaH in STYA201 partially restored invasion (18-fold) but appeared to have no effect on STYY202 (Fig. 2). This incomplete restoration may indicate poor expression of the cloned apaH gene or that the specific Ap n N or Np n N responsible for creating the non-invasive phenotype are better substrates for YgdP. It also suggests that the full phenotypes of the single mutants have elements that are distinct, in addition to the common feature and consequences of increased Ap n N and Np n N. Similar data were obtained with U-937 macrophage-like cells. Adhesion of the single mutants to both HEp-2 and U-937 cells was measured by recovery of colony-forming units from washed cell cultures. Both STYA201 and STYY202 showed a dramatically reduced ability to adhere to either cell type (Fig. 3). This was confirmed by microscopic examination after Giemsa staining (36Fletcher J.N. Embaye H.E. Getty B. Batt R.M. Hart C.A. Saunders J.R. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2229-2236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Growth, Morphology, and Motility—Apparent doubling times in LB determined from optical density measurements were similar for WT, STYA201, and STYY202 (20–22 min). However, STYA201 showed a much longer lag-phase after inoculation compared with the others (4.5 versus"
https://openalex.org/W1996247731,"Many surface proteins are anchored to the cell wall by the action of sortase enzymes, a recently discovered family of cysteine transpeptidases. As the surface proteins of human pathogens are frequently required for virulence, the sortase-mediated anchoring reaction represents a potential target for new anti-infective agents. It has been suggested that the sortase from Staphylococcus aureus (SrtA), may use a similar catalytic strategy as the papain cysteine proteases, holding its Cys184 side chain in an active configuration through a thiolate-imidazolium ion interaction with residue His120. To investigate the mechanism of transpeptidation, we have synthesized a peptidyl-vinyl sulfone substrate mimic that irreversibly inhibits SrtA. Through the study of the pH dependence of SrtA inhibition and NMR, we have estimated the pKa s of the active site thiol (Cys184) and imidazole (His120) to be ∼9.4 and 7.0, respectively. These measurements are inconsistent with the existence of a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair and suggest a general base catalysis mechanism during transpeptidation.

To investigate the mechanism of transpeptidation, we have synthesized a peptidyl-vinyl sulfone substrate mimic that irreversibly inhibits SrtA. Through the study of the pH dependence of SrtA inhibition and NMR, we have estimated the pKa s of the active site thiol (Cys184) and imidazole (His120) to be ∼9.4 and 7.0, respectively. These measurements are inconsistent with the existence of a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair and suggest a general base catalysis mechanism during transpeptidation. Gram-positive bacteria infect humans through an array of surface-associated proteins that promote bacterial adhesion, resistance to phagocytic killing, and host cell invasion. Many surface proteins are covalently anchored to the cell wall by the action of sortase enzymes, a family of novel transpeptidases (reviewed in Refs. 1Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

The structure of SrtA revealed a novel protein fold and localized the active site to a hydrophobic surface depression that contains two highly conserved and enzymatically important residues, His120 and Cys184 (SrtA numbering) (16Ilangovan U.

This catalytic dyad is reminiscent of the active sites of the papain cysteine proteases (Cys25-His159-Asn175, papain numbering) (19Drenth J. Jansonius J.N. Koekoek R. Swen H.M. Wolthers B.G.

Struct. 1999; 28: 181-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In this model of SrtA function, the imidazole ring of His120 promotes the formation of the Cys184 thiolate, which then nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl carbon at the scissile Thr-Gly peptide bond in the LPXTG motif (22Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). After covalent linkage via a thioacyl bond to the threonine carbonyl group, the incoming amine of the cell wall precursor lipid II (23Ruzin A. Severin A. Ritacco F. Tabei K. Singh G. Bradford P.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7447-7452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Previous work left unresolved how His120 activates Cys184. In the papain cysteine proteases, the cysteine side chain is held in an active configuration through a thiolate-imidazolium ion interaction with the histidine (25Lewis S.D. Johnson F.A. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, in the NMR structure of SrtA solved in the absence of its substrates, the side chains of Cys184 and His120 do not interact, arguing against the presence of an ion pair (16Ilangovan U. Ton-That H. Iwahara J. Schneewind O. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To resolve this issue, and as a first step toward the design of a therapeutically useful anti-infective agent, we have synthesized a peptidyl-vinyl sulfone substrate mimic that inhibits SrtA. The pH dependence of SrtA inhibition and NMR studies preclude the presence of an ion pair in the active site, because His120 and Cys184 have pKa values of 7.0, and ∼9.4, respectively. Reagents—Residues 60–206 of wild-type sortase (SrtAΔN59) and a single amino acid mutant of the protein containing a cysteine to alanine substitution at position 184 (C184ASrtAΔN59) were overexpressed from plasmids pSRTA and pHTT45, respectively (16Ilangovan U. Ton-That H. Iwahara J. Schneewind O. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 18Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Alksne L. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7447-7452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The expression, uniform isotopic labeling (where applicable), and purification of SrtAΔN59 and C184ASrtAΔN59 have been described previously (16Ilangovan U. Ton-That H. Iwahara J. Schneewind O. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The fluorescent substrate peptide d-QALPETGEE-e (where d is dabcyl (4-([4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]azo)-benzoyl-) and e is EDANS ([(2-aminoethyl)-amino]naphthlene-1-sulfonyl-)) was purchased from Synpep (Dublin, CA) and purified by HPLC. 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; N-t-Boc, N-tert-butoxycarbonyl; Cbz, benzyloxycarbonyl. Reagents for the synthesis of the vinyl sulfone inhibitor were purchased from Aldrich. Synthesis of Vinyl Sulfone Inhibitor—The vinyl sulfone inhibitor was synthesized using solution phase methodology (see Fig. 1). The Leu-Pro-Ala tripeptide was synthesized by standard amino acid coupling chemistry using 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (DMAP), starting with the carbobenzyloxy-protected amino acid Cbz-Leu-OH and N-tert-butoxycarbonyl (N-t-Boc) methyl esters of alanine and proline. l-Threonine was fully protected as the N-t-Boc-threonine methyl ester with the alcohol protected as the t-butyldiphenylsilyl ether (2) in three steps. The ester was reduced with diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) to the aldehyde, which was immediately reacted without purification with diethyl phenylsulfonylmethylphosphonate (3) to give the desired vinyl sulfone functionality (4) in good yield. Removal of the Boc group with trifluoroacetic acid followed by coupling the amine with the Cbz-protected tripeptide gave the desired tetrapeptide. Removal of the t-butyldiphenylsilyl group with HF gave the vinyl sulfone inhibitor (1). The inhibitor was purified by silica gel chromatography and the structure confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and FAB+ (fast atom bombardment) mass spectrometry. Enzyme Assays—Fluorescent measurements of SrtA activity in the presence of the vinyl sulfone inhibitor were performed in 96-well microtiter plates as described previously (26Scott C.J. McDowell A. Martin S.L. Lynas J.F. Vandenbroeck K. Walker B. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 953-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition reactions contained 5 μm SrtA and vinyl sulfone inhibitor (100, 300, or 600 μm) in buffer R (50 mm Tris, pH 3.5–10, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm glycine, 5 mm CaCl2). d-QALPETGEE-e was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the reaction at a final concentration of 25 μm, for a total reaction volume of 200 μl. The final concentration of Me2SO in the reaction was kept below 5%. The reactions were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C with gentle mixing in a GENios multiwell fluorimeter (Tecan, Durham, NC) (360 nm excitation filter, 465 nm emission filter). Fluorescence emission was recorded at 10-min intervals and blanked against a reference solution containing SrtA in buffer R. All enzyme assays were performed in triplicate, resulting in ∼450 measurements for each inhibitor concentration assayed. The inhibition parameters Ki and ki were solved simultaneously for each inhibitor concentration using the equation, [P]t=[E]([S]Ki/[I]Km)(kcat/ki)[1-e-kit/{1+Ki/[I](1+[S]/[Km])}](Eq. 1) where [P] t is the concentration of product at time t, [E] is the total concentration of SrtA, and [S] and [I] are the total concentrations of the fluorogenic substrate and inhibitor, respectively (27Wu J.C. Fritz L.C. Methods. 1999; 17: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Km and k cat (the Michaelis and first-order rate constants for the uninhibited SrtA transpeptidation reaction, respectively) were determined independently for each pH value (data not shown). Curves were fit using the program Sigmaplot2000 (SPSS version 6.0). HPLC Analysis of Inhibitor Modification of SrtA—Thirty microliters of SrtA (95–100 μm) in buffer I (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2) were adjusted to the desired pH with 1 m HCl or 1 m NaOH as needed and were incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of the vinyl sulfone inhibitor for 20 h at 37 °C with gentle agitation. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water), and the products were separated by reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column (Waters, Milford, MA) with the application of a gradient of 25–50% buffer B (90% acetonitrile, 10% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were carried out at 308 K on a Bruker DRX500 spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe using 15N- and 13C-labeled SrtAΔN59 and C184ASrtAΔN59 proteins (0.5 mm) in buffer N (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.2), 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, 3 mm dithiothreitol, and 7% D2O). The chemical shifts of wild-type SrtAΔN59 have been reported previously, and the resonances of the single histidine side chain (His120) in the C184ASrtAΔN59 mutant were readily assigned by reference to these data. For the pKa measurements, a series of two-dimensional 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra were recorded to monitor the pH dependence of the 1H-δ2-13C-δ2 and 1H-ϵ1-13C-ϵ1 resonances of the His120 side chain (spectra recorded at pH values of 4.5–10). Chemical shifts in the NMR spectra were plotted as a function of pH and fit to the following equation, δobs=(δHA+δA×10pH-pKa)/(1+10pH-pKa)(Eq. 2) where δHA and δA are the chemical shifts of the fully protonated and deprotonated forms of the ionizable group, and δobs is the observed chemical shift (28Jimenez M.A. Villegas V. Santoro J. Serrano L. Vendrell J. Aviles F.X. Rico M. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 29Khare D. Alexander P. Antosiewicz J. Bryan P. Gilson M. Orban J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3580-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The data were fit using SigmaPlot2000. To characterize the active site His120-Cys184 dyad, we synthesized an irreversible inhibitor that consisted of the substrate recognition motif of SrtA (-Leu-Pro-X-Thr-Gly-, where X is any amino acid) but replaced the scissile Thr-Gly amide bond with a vinyl sulfone group (C = C-SO2Ph) (Fig. 1A). Alanine was placed at the X position to facilitate the synthesis, and the vinyl sulfone group was used because it has previously been shown to covalently modify the active site thiol in cysteine proteases (30Bromme D.

Palmer J.T. Ho J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This is relevant because mutagenesis studies have demonstrated the catalytic importance of SrtA residue Cys184 (18Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Alksne L. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7447-7452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and several sulfhydryl-directed reagents block the activity of SrtA in vitro (17Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9876-9881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 18Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Alksne L. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7447-7452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The efficacy of the vinyl sulfone compound was tested in vitro by determining how it altered the SrtA-catalyzed hydrolysis of an internally quenched fluorescent substrate analogue (d-Gln-Ala-Leu-Pro-Glu-Thr-Gly-Glu-Glu-e). Hydrolysis progress curves were generated by monitoring the increase in fluorescence that accompanies the cleavage of the substrate (18Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Alksne L. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7447-7452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 26Scott C.J. McDowell A. Martin S.L. Lynas J.F. Vandenbroeck K. Walker B. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 953-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The curves were consistent with the vinyl sulfone compound acting as an irreversible inhibitor of SrtA (Fig. 2A) (35Tian W.X. Tsou C.L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Typical progress curves of the reaction in the presence of 100, 300, and 600 μm inhibitor are shown in Fig. 2B. Fits of these data to Equation 1 by non-linear regression analysis determined the first-order rate constant of inactivation (ki) and the dissociation constant of inhibitor binding (Ki). At pH 7, the Ki of the inhibitor is 9 × 10–6m, which is comparable with the measured Km of SrtA of 3 × 10–6m for the fluorogenic substrate analogue (data not shown). The rate constant of inactivation (ki) of the vinyl sulfone inhibitor is 4 × 10–4 min–1. To date, only two other irreversible SrtA inhibitors have been characterized. Both contain the Cbz-Leu-Pro-Ala-Thr sorting signal mimic of the vinyl sulfone compound but utilize different reactive groups (diazomethane and chloromethane) (26Scott C.J. McDowell A. Martin S.L. Lynas J.F. Vandenbroeck K. Walker B. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 953-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first-order rate constants of the peptidyl-diazomethane (5.8 × 10–3 min–1) and -chloromethane (1.1 × 10–2 min–1) SrtA inhibitors are larger than the vinyl sulfone ki by ∼10- and 20-fold, respectively (26Scott C.J. McDowell A. Martin S.L. Lynas J.F. Vandenbroeck K. Walker B. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 953-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This difference in reactivity is consistent with the higher electrophilicity of chloro- and diazomethane reactive groups and has been observed in inhibition studies of other cysteine proteases (36Otto H.H. Schirmeister T. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 133-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). For example, diazomethane and chloromethane inhibitors of human cathepsin L have second-order rate constants up to 100-fold higher than vinyl sulfone inhibitors (30Bromme D. Klaus J.L. Okamoto K. Rasnick D. Palmer J.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 36Otto H.H. Schirmeister T. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 133-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). As the transpeptidation reaction of SrtA is extremely poor in vitro (k cat/K m) = 20.6 m·s–1 it probably does not reflect the efficiency of the enzyme in vivo, where it must complete the anchoring of surface proteins within the doubling time of the bacterium. The development of a quantitative in vivo assay for inhibition will be necessary to evaluate the efficacy of peptidyl inhibitors of sortase as anti-infective agents. Because the vinyl sulfone warhead of the peptide inhibitor is expected to be most reactive toward cysteine thiolates, and Cys184 is the only cysteine in SrtA, we measured the pH dependence of inactivation to determine the pK a of Cys184. The in vitro hydrolysis reaction was repeated at the three inhibitor concentrations over the pH range of 3.5–10, and the inhibition parameters Ki and ki were determined by curve fitting. As shown in Fig. 2C, ki increases dramatically above pH 8, whereas the Ki value is not significantly affected. To estimate the pK a of Cys184, a modified Henderson-Hasselbach equation (37Krekel F. Samland A.K. Macheroux P. Amrhein N. Evans J.N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12671-12677Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), ki=(kmin+(kmax-kmin))/(1+10pKa-pH)(Eq. 3) (where k min and k max are the minimum and maximum observed first-order inhibition constants) was modeled for the inhibitor data by fixing k min (4 × 10–4 min–1 at pH 6) and solving for k max over a range of pKa values. Plots of Equation 3 for pKa values of 9 (dotted line), 9.5 (dashed line), and 10 (solid line) are shown in Fig. 2C. The estimated the pKa of Cys184 is ∼9.4. To confirm that the pH-dependent inhibition of SrtA results from the covalent modification of Cys184, we tracked the modification reaction by chromatography. The SrtA protein was incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of inhibitor for 20 h, and the reaction products were separated by HPLC. Fig. 3, A–C shows the results of incubating SrtA with the inhibitor at pH 9, 7, and 6, respectively. Two inhibitor-modified SrtA species elute on a C18 reverse phase HPLC column (peaks 1 and 2), and mass spectrometry indicates that both peaks contain SrtA covalently modified by a single inhibitor molecule. At pH values of 6 and 7, little modification occurs within 20 h with a slight excess of species 2 being produced. However, at pH 9.0, nearly all of the SrtA protein is converted to species 1 (Fig. 3A). An analysis of the pH dependence of modification indicates that the production of species 1 is most efficient at pH values nearing 9, whereas maximal production of the minor species 2 occurs at pH ∼7 (data not shown). Because the enzyme is maximally inhibited by the vinyl sulfone compound at high pH values (Fig. 2C), where species 1 is almost exclusively present, the data strongly suggest that species 1 corresponds to the inhibitor-SrtA complex that forms during the inactivation. This hypothesis was substantiated by thiolating Cys184 with a 2-fold excess of nitroxide spin label HO-225 ((1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate) (38Berliner L.J. Grunwald J. Hankovszky H.O. Hideg K. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 450-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and testing for its ability to react with the vinyl sulfone inhibitor at pH 9. As shown in Fig. 3D, preincubation with HO-225 prevented the formation of both species 1 and 2. These data are consistent with Cys184 being the primary and most reactive site for modification by the vinyl sulfone at pH values above 8. To investigate whether an imidazolium ion is present in the active site of SrtA, NMR was used to determine the pKa of the His120 side chain. Because the chemical shifts of atoms within the imidazole are expected to be sensitive to the ionization state of the side chain, a series of 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectra were recorded using a 13C- and 15N-enriched sample of SrtA, and the chemical shifts of the 1H-δ2 and 1H-ϵ1 atoms of His120 were recorded at pH values between 4.5 and 10. Fig. 4 shows a plot of the chemical shift of the 1H-ϵ1 atom as a function of pH (a similar curve was obtained for the 1H-δ2 atom). A fit of the titration data to Equation 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicates that the His120 side chain has a pKa of 7.0 ± 0.1 in the presence of 20 mm CaCl2. Because Ca2+ binding near the active site has been shown to enhance the in vitro activity of SrtA 8-fold (16Ilangovan U. Ton-That H. Iwahara J. Schneewind O. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), we repeated the pH titration experiment in calcium-free buffer (buffer N with no calcium) to determine the effects of Ca2+ on the ionization state of the active site His120 residue. No significant changes in the pKa of His120 were detected in the absence of calcium (pKa = 6.6 ± 0.1) (Fig. 4B). The data indicate that at physiological pH, the imidazole side chain is only partially protonated and that calcium does not stimulate the activity of SrtA by altering the ionization state of His120. Ca2+ binding may stabilize substrate binding or the fold of the protein. If a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair exists in the active site of SrtA, one would expect the thiolate of Cys184 to perturb the ionization of His120 (i.e. alter its pKa). We ascertained the effect of Cys184 on His120 by repeating the NMR-pH titration experiment using the mutant C184ASrtAΔN59. The results of this titration (Fig. 4A, open circles) were fit to Equation 2 to obtain a pKa of 7.3 ± 0.1. The similarly measured pKa values for His120 in the wild-type and mutant SrtA proteins suggest that its ionization state is independent of the Cys184 side chain, a finding that is inconsistent with the existence of an ion pair between His120 and Cys184. A thiolate-imidazolium ion pair between the side chains of His120 and Cys184 would enhance the reactivity of the thiol toward electrophiles at weakly acidic and neutral pH (36Otto H.H. Schirmeister T. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 133-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) because the imidazole group would act to polarize the thiol. In this scenario, it is expected that the pKa value of the cysteine thiol would be more acidic and the histidine imidazole would be more basic than their normal values of 7.85 and 6.0, respectively (39Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research, p. 131. 3rd ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1986Google Scholar). For example, the anomalous pKa values of 3.3 (for the Cys25 thiol) and 8.5 (for the His159 imidazolium) support the existence of a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair in papain (40Pinitglang S. Watts A.B. Patel M. Reid J.D. Noble M.A. Gul S. Bokth A. Naeem A. Patel H. Thomas E.W. Sreedharan S.K. Verma C. Brocklehurst K.

In SrtA, however, our investigation argues against the use of a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair in the reaction mechanism. The pH dependence of modification of Cys184 by the vinyl sulfone inhibitor (Fig. 2C) shows a dramatic increase in the first-order rate of inactivation as the pH is raised from 7.5 to 10 (at pH 10 the inhibitor is 20 times more reactive than at pH 7.5). Because the inhibitor is expected to be more reactive toward a thiolate ion, the pH dependence of inhibition can be attributed to the deprotonation of Cys184. These data argue against the presence of an ion pair in the active site, because the pK a of Cys184 is estimated to be ∼9.4. NMR studies of the His120 side chain have measured its pKa at 7.0 in the wild-type protein, which is inconsistent with the presence of an imidazolium cation at neutral pH. Moreover, our finding that the removal of the Cys184 side chain (C184ASrtAΔN59) has only a modest effect on the ionization state of His120 side chain argues against the presence of an ion pair, because in the papain system the pK a of His159 is lowered by 4.5 pH units upon the methylthiolation of the Cys25 (25Lewis S.D. Johnson F.A. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 48-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although the thiolate-imidazolium ion pair is a common catalytic entity of cysteine proteases, it is not universal (42Sarkany Z. Szeltner Z. Polgar L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10601-10606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 43Sarkany Z. Polgar L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 516-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The absence of an ion pair in SrtA suggests its catalytic mechanism may be similar to the viral 3C proteases (picornains), a structurally and mechanistically distinct group of cysteine proteases that perform general base catalysis (reviewed in Refs. 36Otto H.H. Schirmeister T. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 133-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar and 44Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 2001; 382: 727-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The pH-dependent alkylation of the active site cysteine of poliovirus protease 3C with iodoacetamide has measured its pKa at 8.86 (42Sarkany Z. Szeltner Z. Polgar L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10601-10606Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which is similar to the estimated pKa of the SrtA thiol. This is consistent with a reaction mechanism in which the cysteine nucleophile is uncharged at physiological pH, and the histidine functions as a general base.

https://openalex.org/W2103300721,"Development of the aleurone layer of maize grains requires the activity of the Defective kernel 1 (Dek1) gene, encoding a predicted 240-kDa membrane-anchored protein with a C terminus similar to animal calpain domain II&III. Three-dimensional modeling shows that DEK1 domain II contains a conserved calpain catalytic triad and that domain II&III has a predicted structure similar to m-calpain. Recombinant DEK1 domain II&III exhibits activity in the caseinolytic assay in the absence of calcium, although the activity is enhanced by calcium. This is in sharp contrast to animal calpains, which require Ca2+ to be active. Bacterially expressed DEK1 domain II does not display caseinolytic activity, suggesting an important role for DEK1 domain III. Mutation of the catalytic Cys residue to Ser leads to a loss of caseinolytic activity of DEK1 domain II&III. Two features of DEK1 calpain may contribute to maintaining the active site triad in an “active” configuration in the absence of Ca2+, both of which are predicted to keep m-calpain domains IIa and IIb apart. First, DEK1 lacks key charged residues in the basic loop of domain II, and secondly, the absence of an acidic loop in domain III, both of which are predicted to be neutralized upon Ca2+ binding. The Dek1 transcript is present in all cell types in developing maize endosperm, suggesting that the activity of the DEK1 calpain is regulated at the post-transcription level.

The Dek1 transcript is present in all cell types in developing maize endosperm, suggesting that the activity of the DEK1 calpain is regulated at the post-transcription level. The role of DEK1 in aleurone signaling is discussed. In cereal grains, the aleurone layer consists of densely cytoplasmic cells covering the surface of the endosperm, the grain storage tissue that is used for feed, food and industrial raw material (1Olsen O.-A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Aleurone cells contain a large numbers of protein and oil bodies and are cytologically and biochemically distinct from the storage cells of the underlying starchy endosperm. Upon imbibition of the grain, aleurone cells secrete enzymes that mobilize stored starch and protein reserves for seedling growth (2Ritchie S. Gilroy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2697-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The endosperm develops from the central cell after double fertilization through a cellularization process that results in a peripheral layer of aleurone cell initials (3Brown R.C. Lemon B.E. Olsen O.-A. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1241-1252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From genetic evidence, the tumor necrosis factor receptor-like kinase CRINKLY4 (CR4) is implicated in aleurone cell fate specification (4Becraft P.W. Stinard P.S. McCarty D.R. Science. 1996; 273: 1406-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 5Becraft P.W. Kang S.H. Suh S.G. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 6Becraft P.W.

Based on the identity of the Cr4 gene product, as well as the peripheral position of the aleurone layer, we proposed a model in which the CR4 receptor is activated by a ligand in the periphery of the endosperm (8Olsen O.-A.

Recently, we isolated the defective kernel 1 (dek1) 1The abbreviations used are: dek1, defective kernel 1 gene; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DAP, days after pollination; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.1The abbreviations used are: dek1, defective kernel 1 gene; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DAP, days after pollination; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. gene, which is also essential for aleurone cell development (9Lid S.E.

Homozygous recessive dek1 endosperm initiates aleurone cell fate specification, but fails to maintain aleurone cell fate, resulting in grains that lack aleurone cells (9Lid S.E. Gruis D. Jung R. Lorentzen J.A. Ananiev E. Chamberlin M. Niu X. Meeley R. Nichols S. Olsen O.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5460-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Revertant sector analysis has demonstrated that Dek1 function is essential for the maintenance of aleurone cell fate throughout grain development (10Becraft P.W. Asuncion-Crabb Y. Development. 2000; 127: 4039-4048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Becraft P.W. Li K. Dey N. Asuncion-Crabb Y. Development. 2002; 129: 5217-5225PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis predicts that the Dek1 gene encodes a 240 kDa protein with 21 membrane spanning domains and a cytoplasmic C terminus similar to animal calpain domains II&III (9Lid S.E. Gruis D. Jung R. Lorentzen J.A. Ananiev E. Chamberlin M. Niu X. Meeley R. Nichols S. Olsen O.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5460-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Based on BLAST analysis of the complete and near complete genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, respectively, as well as extensive EST collections in maize, the DEK1 calpain is the only member of the calpain gene superfamily in plants (9Lid S.E. Gruis D. Jung R. Lorentzen J.A. Ananiev E. Chamberlin M. Niu X. Meeley R. Nichols S. Olsen O.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 1997; 328: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 13Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) that consist of ubiquitous and tissue-specific isoforms in animals. Two mammalian calpains, m- and μ-calpain, are ubiquitously expressed and have been extensively characterized. Each of these forms a heterodimer comprising an 80-kDa catalytic subunit and a 30-kDa regulatory subunit. The μ- and m-isoforms differ in their in vitro requirements for Ca2+, the half-maximal activity in vitro for μ-calpain being 50 μm Ca2+ while m-calpain requires 300 μm Ca2+. The catalytic subunit of m-calpain is comprised of four domains; domain I which is involved in autolytic activation; domain II containing the catalytic triad residues (Cys-105, His-262, Asn-286 in m-calpain); domain III with similarity to a C2-domain and domain IV that has five EF-hand motifs (13Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 14Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The small, or regulatory subunit of calpain contains domain V, which is glycine- and proline-rich and domain VI that has several EF-hand motifs and is structurally very similar to domain IV of the catalytic subunit (15Xie X. Dwyer M.D. Swenson L. Parker M.H. Botfield M.C. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2419-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Schad E. Farkas A. Jekely G. Tompa P. Friedrich P. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 383-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).More than a dozen calpain genes have been cloned and identified in animals. In addition to conventional calpain with a four domain structure, atypical calpains have been described where individual domains are replaced or deleted (17Ma H. Fukiage C. Kim Y.H. Duncan M.K.

Acta. 2001; 1517: 316-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Some of these calpains appear to function as monomers and do not associate with a regulatory calpain subunit. These different properties indicate that individual isoforms of calpain are regulated differently and may have unique functions. The physiological role of calpain is determined by the function of the protein targeted for proteolysis. Various types of proteins such as transcription factors, calmodulin-binding proteins, components of receptor-mediated signal transduction and cytoskeletal proteins have been identified as calpain substrates in vitro or in vivo (20Aragon B.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2702-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Calpains are reported to be involved in a wide range of cellular processes including cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and signal transduction. In addition, calpains have been implicated in endocytosis, exocytosis, and intracellular membrane fusion (30Sato K. Saito Y. Kawashima S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Although an understanding of calpain at the molecular, biochemical, and cellular levels has advanced greatly in animals since calpain was first described in 1964 (31Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 149-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the functional significance of the DEK1 calpain in plants was not identified until 2001 (9Lid S.E. Gruis D. Jung R. Lorentzen J.A. Ananiev E. Chamberlin M. Niu X. Meeley R. Nichols S. Olsen O.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5460-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In maize, the phenotype of dek1 mutants suggests a role for Dek1 in global developmental regulation. In addition to the lack of aleurone cells, knockout of the Dek1 gene results in improper embryo axis formation and a missing shoot apical meristem (9Lid S.E. Gruis D. Jung R. Lorentzen J.A.

Also, as shown by mutant sector analysis, leaf differentiation, and in particular epidermis cell formation, requires Dek1 gene function (11Becraft P.W. Li K. Dey N. Asuncion-Crabb Y. Development. 2002; 129: 5217-5225PubMed Google Scholar). The predicted structure of DEK1 calpain suggests that it may function as a cysteine proteinase, and that its activity is regulated by extra cellular events mediated through the predicted membrane portion of the protein. In this study we investigate the structure of the calpain-like domain of DEK1 by using three-dimensional modeling and its biological activity by expressing recombinant DEK1 protein in bacteria. We also investigate the pattern of Dek1 transcript distribution in maize grains using in situ hybridization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMolecular Modeling of DEK1 Calpain Domains—The crystal structure of rat (Rattus norvegicus) m-calpain catalytic subunit (PDB 1DF0_A, 2.6 Å resolution) was used as a template to model the calpain domain of DEK1. Following a manual sequence alignment, the two proteins shared >30% sequence identity and >45% sequence similarity. Modeling studies were done on a SGI workstation with Modeler, an automated homology modeling program, using the Insight II software from Accelrys (San Diego, CA). Ten energy-minimized models were generated and three models with the lowest value of the objective function were further evaluated for appropriate stereochemistry using the Verify3D program (32Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar). The model with the highest self-compatibility score in the Verify program was selected for the final study.Cloning of cDNA Domains Encoding DEK1 Domain Proteins in Escherichia coli Expression Vectors—cDNA fragments corresponding to DEK1 calpain domains (9Lid S.E. Gruis D. Jung R. Lorentzen J.A. Ananiev E. Chamberlin M. Niu X. Meeley R. Nichols S. Olsen O.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5460-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR. The flanking primers used for domain II&III and domain II were: 5′-GTCGACTTCACTGATCAAGAGTTCCCTC-3′ with SalI site (forward) and 5′-GCGGCCGCTTAAACAGCCTCTAGTCTGATTGATG-3′ with NotI site (reverse) and 5′-GTCGACTTCACTGATCAAGAGTTCCCTC-3′ with SalI site (forward) and 5′-CGGCCGCTTAATAAACACGACAAACATATATTG-3′ with NotI site (reverse), respectively. The cDNAs were ligated into pCR2.1 TOPO (Invitrogen) and then into pGEX-4T vector (Amersham Biosciences), which produced a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion at the N terminus. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into TOP 10 E. coli (Invitrogen). After insert sequences were verified by sequencing, the constructs were transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli (Invitrogen) for protein expression.The Expression of DEK1 Domain II&III using Fermentation—The Dek1 domain II&III pGEX 4T-3 construct was transformed into BL21 Codon + RP cells (Stratagene). A 5-liter fermentor containing 5 liters of Terrific Broth (Yeast Extract 24 g/liter, pancreatic digest of casein 12 g/liter, dipotassium, phosphate 9.4 g/liter, monopotassium phosphate 2.2 g/liter, glycerol 4 ml/liter), 100 μg/ml carbenicillin, and 5 ml of antifoam (Mazu DF 204 Defoamer) was inoculated with 50 ml of overnight culture grown at 37 °C. The fermentation culture was grown at 37 °C until an OD600 of 1.0 was reached. The temperature was then lowered to 30 °C. The dissolved oxygen was maintained at greater than 30% throughout the run by controlling both stirring and airflow. The pH was maintained at 7.2 with NH4OH. The culture was induced with 0.1 mm IPTG (isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside) at an OD600 of 2.5. Three hours after induction, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. A pellet from 1 liter of fermentation culture was resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, Complete Proteinase Inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), lysozyme 1 mg/ml, bensonase 1 unit/ml) and lysed by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione Sepharose 4B beads prewashed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.3) with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 0.5–1 h. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with a buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mm reduced glutathione. The protein concentration was estimated by using a dye-binding protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard.The Expression of DEK1 Domain II—E. coli BL21 cell cultures were grown in LB medium (Difco Laboratories) with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. The transformed cells harboring Dek1 domain II were grown at 37 °Cto an absorbance of ∼1.0 at 600 nm. 5 ml of the cells were transferred into a 1-liter flask with 200 ml of LB medium containing 0.1 mm IPTG and incubated overnight at 18 °C. The cells were then harvested for the GST-DEK1 domain II purification as mentioned above.Site-directed Mutagenesis of DEK1—Site-directed mutagenesis of DEK1 domain protein was generated by a PCR-based overlapping method described by Ho et al. (33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). The flanking primers were the same as those used for domain II&III. The internal primers used for generation of mutant were 5′-TCGGTTGGGAGACTCTTGGTTCCTAAGTG-3′ and 5′-CACTTAGGAACCAAGAGTCTCCCAACCGA-3′ (altered codon is underlined). The mutation was verified by sequencing.DEK1 Activity Assay—The method used to determine the proteolytic activity of DEK1 domains is based on an electrophoretic casein degradation assay used in previous studies of animal m-clapain (34Hata S. Sorimachi H. Nakagawa K. Maeda T. Abe K. Suzuki K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In our assays, a typical reaction contained 2 μg of DEK1 domain protein, 3 μg of purified β-casein (Sigma-Aldrich C6905, more than 90% purity) in 20 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for a variable time interval. The reaction was stopped by adding NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). After incubation at 70 °C for 10 min, the mixture was separated by a NuPAGE 10% bis-tris gel and then stained with Colloidal Blue kit (Invitrogen). Change in the intensity of the β-casein band was used to quantify DEK1 proteolytic activity. Three independent assays were carried out to calculate standard deviation (S.D.) in these assays. Intensity was measured by using the ChemiDoc system (Bio-Rad).CD Studies—CD spectra were measured using a Jasco J-715 model spectropolarimeter. Far-UV spectra were recorded from 190 to 260 nm in a 0.1 mm pathlength quartz cuvette. Protein was dialyzed into 35 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) and diluted to a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml. Data are reported as mean residue ellipticity. In Situ Hybridization Analysis—Digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled RNA probes were used to localize Dek1 mRNA in cells according to the protocol described by Jackson (35Jackson D.P. Bowles D.J., Gurr, S.J., and McPherson, M Molecular Plant Pathology: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 163-174Google Scholar). RNA probes were made using Digoxigenin-11-UTP labeled NTP mixture with SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases (Roche Applied Science). The 721-bp fragment of 3′-region Dek1 cDNA was subcloned into pSPORT I vector (Invitrogen). The clone was linearized by XbaI (sense) and PstI (antisense) and transcribed into RNA in vitro. Unincorporated ribonucleotides were removed using Qiagen RNeasy purification kit and probes were subjected to carbonate hydrolysis in order to reduce probe length to ∼150 nucleotides.

Sequence analysis indicated that DEK1 proteins from different plant species are highly conserved, sharing 70–98% sequence identity (Table I). All plant species investigated were found to have a single copy of Dek1. Structurally, the deduced DEK1 sequence can be divided into several domains, including two transmembrane domains (B1 and B2), an extracellular loop region (C), a hydrophilic and charged domain (D), domain II and domain III as described previously (9Lid S.E. Gruis D. Jung R. Lorentzen J.A. Ananiev E. Chamberlin M. Niu X. Meeley R. Nichols S. Olsen O.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5460-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, there is a predicted membrane targeting signal sequence located at the N terminus. Domain B1, B2, C, and D show no significant amino acid sequence similarity to any other sequences in databases, and their functions remain unknown. In the C terminus, the amino acid sequence of maize DEK1 domain II&III shares about 40–50% similarity and 30 to 40% identity to that of the same domains of animal calpains. To establish the evolutionary relationship among animal calpains and plant DEK1 proteins, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using domain II and III (Fig.1). This analysis suggests that DEK1 domain II&III is evolutionarily most closely related to the animal SOL (small optic lobes) and SOLH (SOL homologue from humans) calpains.Table IAmino acid sequence similarities among plant DEK1 orthologuesPlant speciesAccession No.Corresponding region to maize DEK1SimilarityIdentitiesProteinEST%%Arabidopsis t.NP_1759321-21598270SugarcaneAAN101071000-21599897RiceAAL381901-21599491SorghumBG4642681358-15389897SoybeanBQ2531611884-20639586BE3298631807-20029084BM5678241751-19429498 Open table in a new tab Amino acid sequence alignment of DEK1 calpain and mcalpain demonstrates a conserved domain organization for domain II and domain III (Fig. 2). Indeed, this architecture appears to be remarkably well conserved even in the modeled three-dimensional structure of the protein (Fig. 3A). In addition to the overall fold, the conservation and arrangement of residues important for catalysis and substrate binding in domain II are particularly significant. As in m-calpain, the catalytic Cys-71 (Cys-105 in m-calpain) is located in the α-helix of domain IIa, on the opposite side of the interface with domain IIb which harbors the two other residues of the catalytic triad, His-229 and Asn-249 (corresponding to His-262 and Asn-286 in m-calpain, Fig. 2). Importantly, the distance of ∼10.3 Å between the catalytic Cys Sγ and the His Nδ 1 in the model compares favorably with the ∼10.5 Å measurement for the same atoms in the calcium-free conformation of m-calpain (14Hosfield C.M.

Additional residues conserved within the context of the active-site cleft comprising the subdomains of the catalytic domain include Gln-65, Trp-72, Gly-160–161, Pro-250, and Trp-251 (Fig. 3B). Despite this strong conservation in domain II, however, there are two significant differences to be noted in domain III between m-calpain and DEK1. First, while the basic loop comprising residues His-415-His-427 of m-calpain contains 4 Args and 1 Lys, the corresponding loop in DEK1 (residues 371–383 in Fig. 2) contains just one Arg residue. Even more importantly, in contrast to the very acidic loop of m-calpain (residues 392–402) consisting of 10 negatively charged residues, there is just one conserved Asp-347 in the DEK1 loop (residues 344–354 in Fig. 2; asterisk in Fig. 3A).Fig. 2Structure-sequence alignment of DEK1 calpain and m-calpain (1DF0).

Under conditions normally used to express fusion proteins in E. coli, the majority of the expressed DEK1 domain II&III protein appears in inclusion bodies. Production of the wild-type and mutant (see below) versions of DEK1 domain II&III was therefore carried out by fermentation, yielding a significant amount of soluble domain II&III protein. The expressed DEK1 domain II&III protein was purified to near homogeneity with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Fig. 4A). In contrast to DEK1 domain II&III protein, DEK1 domain II appears both in soluble and insoluble forms under standard expression conditions (Fig. 4A). The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by immunoblotting using an antibody raised against GST and by measuring GST activity (data not shown).Fig. 4Purification of DEK1 domain proteins.

These results indicated that no gross structural rearrangements had occurred in the mutated protein.Characterization of DEK1 Domain II&III Proteinase Activity—The proteolytic activity of DEK1 domain II&III was tested in an assay in which purified β-casein (Fig. 5A, lane 2) was incubated with the DEK1 domain II&III protein under various conditions (Fig. 5A, lane 3). In the presence of 5 mm Ca2+, casein degradation leveled off after approximately 9 h of incubation (Fig. 5A, lanes 4–9). This result suggests that DEK1 domain II&III possesses an activity that is similar to that of m-calpain. Surprisingly, however, DEK1 domain II&III also displays a strong proteolytic activity in the absence of Ca2+. The same proportion of β-casein was degraded after 9"
https://openalex.org/W2091907160,"X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy is a degenerative disease affecting motor neurons that is caused by polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion within the androgen receptor (AR). The polyQ-expanded form of AR is cytotoxic to cells, and proteolytic cleavage enhances cell death. The intracellular signaling pathways activated and/or required for cell death induced by the expanded form of AR (AR112) are unknown. We found that AR regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathways and, therefore, hypothesized that these pathway(s) may be required for AR112-induced cell death. The polyQ expansion in AR activates three MAP kinase pathways, causing increasing levels of phosphorylation of p44/42, p38, and SAPK/JNK MAP kinase. Inhibitors of either the JNK or p38 pathways had no effect on AR112-induced cell death, suggesting they are not required for polyQ-induced cell death. Strikingly, the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, which selectively inhibits the p44/42 MAP kinase pathway, reduces AR112-stimulated cell death. The inhibition of the MEK1/2 pathway correlates directly with a change in phosphorylation state of the androgen receptor. Mutation of the MAP kinase consensus phosphorylation site in AR at serine 514 blocked AR-induced cell death and the generation of caspase-3-derived cleavage products. We propose a mechanism by which phosphorylation at serine 514 of AR enhances the ability of caspase-3 to cleave AR and generate cytotoxic polyQ fragments.

J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1997; 20: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The disease is caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract expansion within the transcriptional activation domain of androgen receptor (AR) (2La Spada A.R. Wilson E.M. Lubahn D.B. Harding A.E. Fischbeck K.H. Nature. 1991; 352: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (2380) Google Scholar). The normal number of CAG repeats is 11–36, whereas the mutant gene has up to 68 repeats. Presumably SBMA is caused by a gain-of-function mutation because severe testicular feminization patients where AR is fully inactivated do not have motor neuron disease (3Brown T.R. Lubahn D.B.

However, male patients with SBMA exhibit some symptoms of partial androgen insensitivity, including gynecomastia, small testicles, and feminization, suggesting some impairment of AR function (5Pinsky L.

SBMA is one of a growing number of polyQ-repeat diseases, including Huntington's disease and the spinocerebellar ataxias, that are characterized by the death of specific neuronal subsets (6Ross C.A.

It is particularly attractive to study the effect of a polyQ expansion in the context of AR because, unlike the other polyQ disease proteins, it has a well characterized function.

We have shown previously that AR is a substrate for caspases, the disease form of AR is toxic to cells, and mutation of the caspase cleavage site in AR attenuates cell death (9Ellerby L.M.

These observations along with other recent studies suggest that proteolytic cleavage by caspases may be important in SBMA and other polyQ diseases (17DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W.

Further, the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway is involved in AR function and phosphorylation (21Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, we tested whether the polyQ expansion in AR activates three major MAP kinase pathways (p44/42, p38, and SAPK/JNK MAP kinases), whether these pathways were required for AR112-mediated cell death, and whether phosphorylation of AR112 was required for AR112-mediated cell death. We found the p44/42 MAP kinase pathway is required for AR112 cell death and mutation of the MAP kinase consensus phosphorylation site in AR at serine 514 blocked AR-induced cell death and the generation of caspase-3-derived cleavage products. The results demonstrate the proteolytic cleavage of mutant AR is modulated by phosphorylation and demonstrate the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, can be used to block AR112-induced cellular toxicity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfections—HEK 293T cells were cultured as described previously (9Ellerby L.M.

Lysate (200 μg) was precleared with anti-mouse IgG agarose (30 μl; Sigma) for 45 min. AR was pulled down with anti-AR-441 monoclonal antibody (5 μg) for 18 h at 4 °C and washed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (5×). Proteins were resolved on Nupage BisTris 4–12% precast gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (BioRad) for 1 h at 25 mA. Membranes were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) (for serine phospho-specific antibodies) or milk in TBST and probed with primary antibody (1:1000) for 2 h at room temperature or 18 h at 4 °C. Antibodies utilized were: phospho-p44/42 MAPK, phospho-SAPK/JNK, phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-ATF-2 monoclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling); AR N-20, AR-441 polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and phosphoserine monoclonal antibody 16B4 (Calbiochem). Monoclonal β-tubulin T-4026 (1:500; Sigma) was used to confirm equal loading of samples.

Gels were dried and autoradiographed, and densitometry was performed using ChemiImager software (Alpha Innotech).RESULTSExpression of the PolyQ-expanded Form of AR Activates MAPK Pathways in 293T Cells—The MAP kinase pathways are known to relay, integrate, and amplify signals from a number of physiological responses, including differentiation, proliferation, inflammation, and apoptosis. Recently, using gene chip analysis, we have found that AR regulates a number of genes involved in the MAP kinase pathway and the polyQ-expanded form of AR differentially regulates these genes. 2M. LaFevre-Bernt, E. Hermel, J. P. Taylor, M. W. Eschoo, and L. M. Ellerby, submitted for publication. We hypothesized that expression of the expanded form of AR, which induces cell death, would result in alterations in the MAP kinase pathway(s). To evaluate the effect of expression of AR12 or AR112 (12 or 112 glutamines, respectively) on the activation of the MAP kinase pathways, 293T cells were transiently transfected with AR constructs. In our cell culture model, expression of AR112 alone is sufficient to induce caspase activation and subsequent cell death. MAP kinase activation was determined by Western blot analysis with phospho-specific antibodies that recognize only the phosphorylated forms of the MAP kinases (Fig. 1, A–C). AR112 leads to increased phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK (Fig. 1A), SAPK/JNK MAPK (Fig. 1B), and the p38 MAPK (Fig. 1C) when compared with AR12 or vector control. Reprobing the Western blot confirmed equal expression of AR, total p44/42 MAPK, and β-tubulin (Fig. 1, D and E). The lower band in the AR112 lane is a proteolytic fragment. These results suggest that activation of a MAPK pathway might play a role in expanded AR-induced cell death.MEK1/2 Pathway Is Required for AR-induced Cytotoxicity— To investigate whether the cytotoxicity of AR112 is mediated by MAPK pathways, we treated 293T cells that had been transiently transfected with AR112 with MAP kinase inhibitors: the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, the SAPK/JNK inhibitor, SP-600125, or the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB 203580. Forty-eight hours after treatment, cytotoxicity was evaluated by monitoring caspase-3 activity (Fig. 2). Addition of the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, dramatically reduced AR112-induced cytotoxicity, reducing it to levels of vector alone (Fig. 2A). Treatment with either a JNK/SAPK inhibitor (SP-600125) or a p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB 203580) did not reduce the toxicity of AR112 (Fig. 2A). Similar results were observed using a cell viability (WST) assay (data not shown). Interestingly, MEK1/2 inhibitor treatment also inhibits the cleavage of AR112 (Fig. 2B). Cleavage of AR has been correlated with cellular toxicity (9Ellerby L.M. Hackam A.S. Propp S.S. Ellerby H.M. Rabizadeh S. Cashman N.R. Trifiro M.A. Pinsky L. Wellington C.L. Salvesen G.S. Hayden M.R. Bredesen D.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). As a control for kinase inhibition, Western blot analysis demonstrated that the inhibitor doses utilized led to a decrease in phosphorylation of the kinases themselves and of ATF-2, a downstream target of the JNK pathway (Fig. 2C). Inhibitor treatments did not affect the expression level of AR. It is possible that the SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK (stress-activated) pathways are activated in a protective response to AR112 cytotoxicity; this explains why the inhibitors of these pathways do not decrease toxicity. Indeed, if these pathways are activated as a protective mechanism in response to cellular stress, inhibition would be expected to increase toxicity, as is observed here (Fig. 2A). Our results suggest that the MEK1/2 pathway is required for AR112-induced cell death.Fig. 2MEK1/2 inhibitor (U0126), but not JNK or p38 MAP kinase inhibitors (SP-600125 and SB203580), decreases AR112-induced cell death in 293T cells. 293T-transfected cells were treated with U0126 (10 μm) or SP-600125 and SB203580 (30 μm) 16 h after transfection for 48 h in the absence of DHT. A, caspase-3 activity was measured using the substrate N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin (DEVD-AFC). **, p <0.01, *, p <0.05, compared with untreated (t test). B, Western blot analysis of cell lysates expressing AR112 treated with U0126.

Phospho-ATF-2 (Thr-71) is a downstream target of SAP/JNK MAPK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Serine Phosphorylation of AR is PolyQ Repeat Length-dependent—Given the increased activation of the MAP kinases, which are serine/threonine kinases, we examined whether AR might be a downstream target of serine phosphorylation. We immunoprecipitated AR12, AR50, or AR112 from transiently transfected 293T cells and performed Western blot analysis. An antibody that recognizes phosphorylated serine with a proline immediately C-terminal (phospho-Ser-Pro) (Fig. 3A, right) was used to evaluate AR phosphorylation because only six serine-proline sites are present in AR. Equivalent amounts of AR were pulled down in each immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A, left panel). Increasing amounts of phosphorylated serine were found in AR with 50 or 112 repeats (Fig. 3A, right panel), although AR12 was not phosphorylated at this site. The nonspecific band that is recognized by the phosphoserine antibody (denoted by *) is not AR, because the AR antibody does not recognize this band in the vector control lane and this band runs at a molecular weight that is between the molecular weight of the AR12 and AR50 bands. Therefore, the expanded form of androgen receptor has increased serine phosphorylation, correlating with the increase in MAP kinase activation.Fig. 3Serine phosphorylation is polyQ repeat length-dependent in 293T cells. A, AR was immunoprecipitated and Western blot analysis was carried out with either AR N-terminal antibody (left) or phosphoserine-specific antibody 16B4 (proline consensus phosphoserine site, phospho-Ser-Pro, right). * indicates a nonspecific immunoreactive band. B, possible serine phosphorylation sites in AR transcriptional activation domain (TAD). C, the MAP kinase consensus sequence is conserved in human (h), mouse (m), and rat (r) AR. D, Western blot of immunoprecipitated AR112 treated with U0126 or 1 μm dihydrotestosterone (DHT) probed with phosphoserine-specific antibody 16B4. E, mutation of serine phosphorylation sites in AR results in reduced isoforms when compared with AR112. Western blot was probed with AR N-terminal antibody. F, mutation of serine phosphorylation site 514 in AR results in the elimination of one isoform of AR112 immunoreactive to phosphoserine-specific antibody 16B4. AR112 was expressed in 293T cells in the absence of testosterone unless otherwise indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phosphorylation of Serine 514 Is Required for AR112-induced Cytotoxicity—Several serine residues, including Ser-19, -210, -514, and -790, are phosphorylated in AR. Phosphorylation at these sites can lead to an increase, no change, or a decrease in AR transactivation activity (20Lin H.K. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7200-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 21Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Particularly of interest is Ser-514, in the transcriptional activation domain (Fig. 3B), which is phosphorylated by MEK1/2 in a prostate cancer cell line (21Yeh S. Lin H.K. Kang H.Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5458-5463Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), is in a MEK1/2 consensus sequence that has a proline at the +1 position (Fig. 3C), and would be recognized by the serine phospho-specific antibody utilized in Fig. 3A. Treatment of AR112-expressing cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 reduced the phosphorylated form of the AR that is immunoreactive to the phospho-Ser-Pro antibody (Fig. 3D, upper panel). Treatment with DHT, which often modulates phosphorylation of AR, did not alter phosphorylation of AR immunoreactive to the phospho-Ser-Pro antibody (Fig. 3D, lower panel). Inhibition of phosphorylation of AR by U0126 suggests the serine phospho-specific antibody recognizes a site in AR phosphorylated by MEK1/2 or downstream targets of this pathway. Ser-28 and Thr-438 also lie in the transcriptional activation domain (Fig. 3B) and are adjacent to FXXLF motifs, which mediate interactions of AR with its transcriptional co-activators. These sites are consensus sites for p90RSK, a kinase that phosphorylates transcription factors and is a downstream target of MEK1/2 (28Sampt E.R. Fernandez G.A. Lehman J.A. Corey S.J. Huang C.K. Gomez-Cambronero J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2001; 48: 219-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar).We used site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate these phosphorylation sites. Mutation of any of these sites eliminates the doublet that is seen in cells expressing AR112, suggesting that these sites affect post-translational modification of AR112 (Fig. 3E). Two isoforms of AR112 are reactive to the phospho-Ser-Pro antibody (Fig. 3F). Immunoreactivity of one of the isoforms of AR112 to the phospho-Ser-Pro antibody is eliminated by mutation of Ser-514 to Ala (Fig. 3F).To investigate the effect of phosphorylation on AR112-induced cytotoxicity, we expressed AR112, AR112 (S28A), AR112 (T438A), and AR112 (S514A) in 293T cells and performed cytotoxicity assays. Transient expression of AR112 (S28A) and AR112 (T438A) increased (1.5-fold) caspase-3 activity (Fig. 4A). However, expression of AR112 (S514A) decreased cytotoxicity (2-fold) in 293T cells. Expression levels of AR112 and the mutants in lysates used for these assays were equivalent (Fig. 3E). Similar results were obtained using a lactate dehydrogenase assay to measure cell death (data not shown). Interestingly, both AR112 and AR112 S514A activate p44/42 MAP kinase pathway (data not shown), suggesting the polyQ expansion activates this pathway but kinase activation is not sufficient for cell death.Fig. 4Phosphorylation of Ser-514 is required for AR112 cytotoxicity in 293T cells and in mouse motor neuron hybrid cell line. A, 293T cells were transfected with AR112, AR112 (S28A), AR112 (T438A), and AR112 (S514A) for 48 h in the absence of DHT. Caspase-3 activity was measured using the substrate DEVD-AFC. Equivalent expression of AR112 mutants was confirmed by Western blot analysis with the AR N-terminal antibody (see Fig. 3E). B, mouse motor neuron (MN) hybrid cells were transfected with pcDNA3, AR12, AR112, AR112 (S514A), and AR112 (D154N) in the presence and absence of 1 μm DHT. Equivalent expression of AR112 mutants was confirmed by Western blot analysis with the AR N-terminal antibody. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured. ***, p <0.005; **, p <0.01; *, p <0.05, compared with AR112 (t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further evaluate whether the phosphorylation status of androgen receptor affected cellular cytotoxicity, we transiently transfected mouse motor neuron-neuroblastoma (MN) hybrid cells, a neuronal cell line directly relevant to SBMA with AR112 and AR112 (S514A). We found, by LDH assay (Fig. 4B) and by caspase activation assay (data not shown), that AR112 (S514A) was less toxic than AR112. Because we have previously reported that the caspase-resistant form of the polyQ-expanded form of AR has reduced cellular toxicity, we compared AR112 (S514A) to AR112 (D154N). Interestingly, the decreased cytotoxicity of the AR112 (S514A) was similar to that observed for AR112 (D154N), a caspase-resistant form of AR that cannot generate N-terminal polyQ-containing caspasemediated cleavage products (Fig. 4B). Next we evaluated whether addition of DHT, which results in nuclear localization and transcriptional activation of AR, modulated cellular toxicity. Cellular toxicity of AR112 expressed in MN hybrid cells was enhanced (Fig. 4B, 1.3-fold, **, p <0.01). DHT did not modulate the toxicity of cells expressing AR112 (S514A) or AR112 (D154N). Expression levels of AR112 and the mutants in lysates used for these assays were equivalent (Fig. 4B). The effect of the Ser-514 mutant is consistent with the decrease in cytotoxicity seen upon treatment of cells with the MEK1/2 inhibitor and further suggests that the MEK1/2 pathway, and specifically MAPK phosphorylation of AR112, is required for cytotoxicity in our cell culture model. Therefore, we focused on the AR112 (S514A) mutant for further characterization.Phosphorylation of Ser-514 Does Not Alter Localization of AR112—In many polyQ diseases, nuclear localization correlates with enhanced cell dysfunction or cell death (29Klement I.A.

Schmid P.C. Nataranjan V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1996; 80: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In animal systems, anandamide (NAE 20:4) acts as an endogenous ligand for cannabinoid receptors and has varied physiological roles, such as the modulation of neurotransmission in the central nervous system (2Wilson R.I. Nicoll R.A. Science. 2002; 296: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Anandamide also activates vanilloid receptors, functions as an endogenous analgesic (3Pertwee R.G. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 63: 569-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), and appears to be involved in neuroprotection (4Hansen H.S. Moesgaard B. Hansen H.H. Petersen G. Chem. Phys.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). These endogenous bioactive molecules lose their signaling activity upon hydrolysis by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH; see Ref. 9Cravatt B.F. Lichtman A.H. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 121: 135-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In plants NAEs are present in substantial amounts in desiccated seeds (∼1 μg g–1 fresh weight), and their levels decline after a few hours of imbibition (10Chapman K.D. Venables B.J. Markovic R. Blair R.W. Bettinger C. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 1157-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Individual NAEs were identified predominantly as 12C, 16C, and 18C species with N-linoleoylethanolamine (NAE 18:2) generally being the most abundant. Like in animal cells, NAEs are derived from N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (11Schmid H.H.O. Schmid P.C. Nataranjan V. Prog. Lipid Res. 1990; 29: 1-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 12Chapman K.D. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) by the action of a phospholipase D (13Chapman K.D. Tripathy S. Venables B.J. Desouza A.D.

Biophys. 1998; 353: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The occurrence of NAEs in seeds and their rapid depletion during seed imbibition to barely detectable levels in seedlings (12Chapman K.D. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) suggests that these lipids may have a role in the regulation of seed germination and normal seedling development. In fact, recent experiments with Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings showed that when seeds were germinated and maintained on elevated levels (micromolar concentrations) of the naturally occurring NAE 12:0, seedling roots developed abnormally in a manner consistent with a disruption of both normal cell division and cellular expansion (15Blancaflor E.B. Hou G. Chapman K.D. Planta. 2003; 217: 206-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), signifying the importance of regulating NAE levels for normal plant growth and development. The concept of NAEs acting as lipid mediators in plant systems is supported by an increasing amount of experimental evidence in vegetative tissues where normal levels of NAEs are quite low (low nanomolar concentrations). For example, NAE 14:0 appears to function as an endogenous modulator of pathogen elicitor signaling by plant cells (12Chapman K.D. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Tripathy S. Kleppinger-Sparace K. Dixon R.A. Chapman K.D. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1781-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). NAE 14:0 levels, quantified by gas-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, increased 10–50-fold in leaves of tobacco plants that were treated for a few minutes with either xylanase or cryptogein elicitor proteins (17Tripathy S. Venables B.J. Chapman K.D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These “elicitor-activated” levels of NAE 14:0 (submicromolar concentrations) were sufficient to induce defense gene expression (e.g. phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and PAL2 transcript abundance) in tobacco plants within hours of treatment in a manner similar to but independent of elicitor proteins (17Tripathy S. Venables B.J. Chapman K.D. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Mammalian cannabinoid receptor antagonists at concentrations equimolar to NAE blocked the activation of defense gene expression induced by either NAEs or by fungal elicitor proteins (16Tripathy S. Kleppinger-Sparace K. Dixon R.A. Chapman K.D. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1781-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A membrane-associated protein was identified in leaves of tobacco (and other plant species), which specifically bound to [3H]NAE 14:0 with high affinity (Kd in the low nanomolar range). This NAE 14:0-binding protein was proposed to mediate the NAE activation of PAL2 expression in tobacco leaves, a conclusion that was based on the similarities between NAE binding properties in vitro and NAE-induced physiological responses in vivo, including experiments with cannabinoid receptor antagonists (16Tripathy S. Kleppinger-Sparace K. Dixon R.A. Chapman K.D. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1781-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although some clear differences are evident between the emerging NAE signaling pathway in plants and the better characterized endocannabinoid signal pathway of animals, there appear to be some remarkable similarities in the formation and perception of bioactive acylethanolamides by these two diverse groups of multicellular organisms. Likewise, we propose that an FAAH-like mechanism operates in plants for NAE signal termination and overall regulation of NAE levels under various physiological conditions. Recently, depletion of NAEs during seed imbibition/germination was determined to occur via two metabolic pathways: one lipoxygenase-mediated for the formation of NAE oxylipins from NAE 18:2, and one amidase-mediated for hydrolysis of saturated and unsaturated NAEs (18Shrestha R. Noordermeer M.A. Vand der Stelt M. Veldenk G.A. Chapman K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of NAEs was reconstituted and characterized in microsomes of cottonseeds and appeared to be catalyzed by an enzyme similar to the FAAH of mammalian species (18Shrestha R. Noordermeer M.A. Vand der Stelt M. Veldenk G.A. Chapman K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of a plant orthologue of mammalian FAAH by bioinformatic approaches, isolation of its cDNA sequence, expression of this cDNA in Escherichia coli, and identification of the protein product as an NAE amidohydrolase. These results support our previous studies on the metabolism of NAEs in plant tissues and for the first time provide molecular evidence for a conserved pathway in both plants and animals for the hydrolysis of NAEs. Moreover, the results of this research now provide a means to manipulate the levels of endogenous NAEs in plants to evaluate the physiological role(s) of these bioactive lipids.

Sequence alignments and some sequence analyses were made with DNASIS software (Hitachi). Sequence-specific primers were designed within the 5′- and 3′-UTR regions of At5g64440 based on predicted exon sequences and were used for reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR (forward, 5′-CATTCAAGTTCCCAACAACTTCACCGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GTCGACGTAAGAAATTCCAACACGG-3′). The template for RT-PCR was total RNA-extracted from the leaves of mature Arabidopsis plants using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Fresh leaf tissue (100 mg) was harvested, ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen, and combined with 2 ml of Trizol reagent for RNA isolation according to the manufacturer's instructions. For RT-PCR, the first strand cDNA synthesis from total RNA was carried out at 50 °C for 30 min and incubated for 4 min at 94 °C before the targeted amplification of the At5g64440 mRNA by Platinum Taq (RT-PCR mixture; Invitrogen) was achieved through 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min followed by a final polymerization step at 72 °C for 7 min. The RT-PCR product was gel-purified and ligated into pTrcHis for nucleotide sequencing. Commercial DNA sequencing of both strands (complete 2× each strand) verified the identity of the cDNA as the AT5g64440 gene product, and the complete cDNA sequence was deposited in GenBank™. Protein Expression—For protein expression, oligonucleotide primers (forward, 5′-ATGGGTAAGTATCAGGTCATGAAACG-3′ and reverse, 5′-GTTTGTATTGAGAATATCATAAAAGATTGC-3′) were designed to amplify only the open reading frame of the above At5g64440 cDNA, and PCR conditions were as above, except that a 10-to-1 ratio of polymerases (Taq-to-Pfu; Invitrogen) was used for amplification, and the template was the RT-PCR product (GenBank™ AY308736) in pTrcHis. The open reading frame-PCR product was gel-purified as above and subcloned into expression vectors, pTrcHis and pTrcHis2, and the constructs were introduced into chemically competent E. coli TOP10 cells as host. Transformed colonies were selected with correct in-frame fusions and cDNA sequence by sequencing of plasmid DNA over the vector insert junctions and by sequencing the inserts completely on both strands. Selected transformed cell lines were grown in LB medium without glucose to an A 600 of 0.6 to 0.7 and induced with 1 mm IPTG for 4 h. Pelleted cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tri-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm DDM) at a ratio of 1-to-108 (E. coli cells-to-DDM molecules; assuming 0.1 A 600 = 108 cells/ml, see Ref. 25Elbing K. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 1. John Wiley and Sons, New York2002: 1.2.1-1.2.2Google Scholar). After incubation on ice for 30 min, resuspended cells were sonicated on ice with six 10-s bursts at high intensity with a 10-s cooling (ice bath) period between each burst. The selection of DDM as the detergent, and determination of optimal DDM concentration and content ratio was based on empirical comparisons for recovery of solubilized active enzyme with the highest specific activity. By the same criteria, DDM was determined to be better for solubilizing active enzyme than either Triton X-100 or CHAPS. Solubilization and Ni2 + Affinity Purification—Routinely, cultured cells (50 ml) were pelleted, resuspended in 8 ml of native binding buffer (50 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 8.0, and 0.5 m NaCl) with 8 mg of lysozyme (Sigma) and 0.2 mm DDM (final), incubated on ice for 30 min, and disrupted by sonication as above. The crude lysate was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h in a Sorvall Discovery 90 model ultracentrifuge (Beckman Ti45 rotor). The supernatant was combined with ProBond resin, precharged with Ni2+, and gently agitated for 60 min to keep the resin suspended in the lysate supernatant. The resin with adsorbed protein was settled, and the supernatant was aspirated off. The resin was washed 4 times to remove nonspecific proteins, and the adsorbed proteins were eluted with imidazole-containing buffer. Eluted proteins were concentrated, and imidazole was removed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm DDM by filtration-centrifugation using Centricon YM-30 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) devices. Affinity-purified proteins were stored at –80 °C in 10% glycerol and were stable for more than 2 months. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Protein samples were diluted in 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue in 1:1 ratio and separated on 8 cm, precast 10% polyacrylamide/SDS gels (Bio-Rad) at 35 mA for 30 min and 60 mA for 60 min. For Western blot analysis, separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad) membrane in a Semidry Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) for 30 min at constant 14 V. Recombinant proteins expressed as c-Myc-epitope fusions were localized with 1-to-5000 dilution of anti-c-Myc antibodies (mouse monoclonal, Invitrogen) and detected by chemiluminescence (Bio-Rad substrate solutions) following incubation with 1-to-2500 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). NAE Amidohydrolase Assays—NAE substrates were synthesized and purified, and enzyme assays were conducted as described previously (18Shrestha R. Noordermeer M.A. Vand der Stelt M. Veldenk G.A. Chapman K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Generally the enzyme source was incubated with 100 μm [14C]NAE (20,000 dpm) in 50 mm BisTris buffer, pH 9.0, for 30 min to survey for NAE amidohydrolase activity (18Shrestha R. Noordermeer M.A. Vand der Stelt M. Veldenk G.A. Chapman K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was examined for time, temperature, protein, and substrate concentration dependence. For enzyme characterization, reactions were initiated with 1 μg of affinity-purified protein and incubated at 30 °C with shaking for 30 min. Assays of lysates of E. coli cells expressing rat FAAH (WT-FAAH; Ref. 26Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) served as a comparison of NAE amidohydrolase activity, whereas non-transformed cell lysates or cell lysates with the Arabidopsis cDNA cloned in reverse orientation with respect to the lacZ promoter served as negative controls for activity assays. Enzyme assays were terminated by the addition of boiling isopropyl alcohol (70 °C), and lipids were extracted into chloroform. Lipid products were separated by TLC, and the distribution of radioactivity was evaluated by radiometric scanning (18Shrestha R. Noordermeer M.A. Vand der Stelt M. Veldenk G.A. Chapman K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Activity was calculated based on the radiospecific activity of 14C-labeled substrate. A general serine hydrolase inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and an irreversible active site-directed FAAH inhibitor, MAFP, were used to probe the sensitivity of recombinant Arabidopsis NAE amidohydrolase activity. Inhibitors were added from stock solutions dissolved in isopropyl alcohol for PMSF or Me2SO for MAFP, and activity was adjusted for minimal solvent effects where necessary based on assays in the presence of the appropriate amount of solvent alone. Protein content was determined by Coomassie Blue dye binding using bovine serum albumin as the protein standard (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). Tentative Identification of Arabidopsis NAE Amidohydrolase—In animal tissues, fatty acid amide hydrolase (EC 3.5.1.4), a member of the amidase signature (AS) family (28Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K.

Deutsch D.G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 108: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). A similar enzymatic activity was characterized previously in cottonseed microsomes (18Shrestha R. Noordermeer M.A. Vand der Stelt M. Veldenk G.A. Chapman K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mammalian FAAH enzymes have a conserved stretch of ∼130 amino acids (31Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19177-19184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) containing a Ser/Ser/Lys catalytic triad (32McKinney M.K. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. May 6, 2003; (10.1074/jbc.M303922200)Google Scholar). The predicted amidase structure has a central conserved motif of GGSS(G/A/S)G (33Chebrou H. Bigey F. Arnaud A. Galzy P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 185-293Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and a somewhat longer stretch of amino acids G(GA)S(GS)(GS)GX(GSA)(GSAVY)X(LIVM)(GSA)X(6)(GSAT)X(GA)X(DE)X(GA) XS(LIVM)RXP(GSAC) is present in all enzymes of the amidase class (PS00457). Two serine residues at 217 and 241, highly conserved in the AS sequence, were found essential for enzymatic activity of recombinant rat FAAH (34Omeir R.L. Arreaza G. Deutsch D.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mutation of either one of the residues into alanine caused complete loss of activity of the enzyme (34Omeir R.L. Arreaza G. Deutsch D.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Also, mutation of serine 218 into alanine caused marked loss of activity (35Patricelli M.P. Lovato M.A. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9804-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Taking these conserved residues in the AS consensus sequence into consideration, several putative plant orthologues were identified computationally. BLAST searches 2W. Gish, blast.wustl.edu. in various data bases using the AS consensus block embedded in rat FAAH (blocks.fhcrc.org) identified one A. thaliana gene (At5g64440) that was selected for further characterization (Fig. 1). The structure and organization of the At5g64440 gene is relatively complex with 21 exons including 5′-UTR (untranslated region) and 3′-UTR (Fig. 1A). The predicted gene is 4689 nucleotides in length and encodes a predicted protein of 607 amino acids with a molecular mass of 66.1 kDa. Based on the presence of the conserved residues characteristic of the canonical AS sequence, this gene seemed likely to encode an Arabidopsis NAE amidohydrolase. To assess if this gene was expressed and to isolate a full-length cDNA for functional studies, oligonucleotide primers were designed within the 5′- and 3′-UTR, and a cDNA fragment was amplified by RT-PCR from Arabidopsis leaf RNA (Fig. 1B). The RT-PCR product was sequenced and found to be 99.9% identical with the corresponding TC139316 annotated at TIGR. The protein domain prediction tools, ProDom (20Servant F. Bru C. Carrère S. Courcelle E. Gouzy J. Peyruc D. Kahn D. Brief. Bioinform. 2002; 3: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), identified six domain families in the Arabidopsis protein, five of which were also found in rat FAAH (Fig. 1C). A single putative transmembrane segment was identified near the N terminus (TMHMM; Refs. 22Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol.

Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences from the Arabidopsis NAE amidohydrolase cDNA and the rat FAAH (28Cravatt B.F. Giang D.K. Mayfield S.P. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. Nature. 1996; 384: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1789) Google Scholar) showed only 18.5% identity over the entire length. Alignment within the AS sequence of 125 amino acids (Fig. 2A , underlined residues) showed 37% identity with five residues determined to be important for catalysis to be absolutely conserved (Ref. 31Patricelli M.P. Cravatt B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19177-19184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar; Lys-142, Ser-217, Ser-218, Ser-241, and Arg-243, denoted by arrows; Fig. 2A). Comparison of a 47-amino acid motif within the AS showed the Arabidopsis protein had close to 60% identity with FAAHs from several mammalian species (Fig. 2B). Organization of predicted secondary structure within this Arabidopsis and rat FAAH AS motif was similar (Fig. 2C), and the structure of the rat enzyme has been confirmed by x-ray crystallography (36Bracey M.H. Hanson M.A. Masuda K.R. Stevens R.C. Cravatt B.F. Science. 2002; 298: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). In addition, this putative A. thaliana NAE amidohydrolase and rat FAAH have similar predicted molecular weights (∼66 kDa), similar predicted topologies (single transmembrane segment near the N terminus with the C terminus facing the cytosol, via TMHMM transmembrane and topology predictor; Refs. 22Krogh A.

We screened phage display libraries to isolate peptides that bind to the αM I domain, the principal ligand binding site of the integrin. Only one peptide motif, (D/E)(D/E)(G/L)W, was obtained with this approach despite the known ligand binding promiscuity of the I domain. Interestingly, such negatively charged sequences are present in many known β2 integrin ligands and also in the catalytic domain of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). We show that purified β2 integrins bind to pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 gelatinases and that that the negatively charged sequence of the MMP catalytic domain is an active β2 integrin-binding site. Furthermore, a synthetic DDGW-containing phage display peptide inhibited the ability of β2 integrin to bind progelatinases but did not inhibit the binding of cell adhesion-mediating substrates such as intercellular adhesion molecule-1, fibrinogen, or an LLG-containing peptide. Immunoprecipitation and cell surface labeling demonstrated complexes of pro-MMP-9 with both the αMβ2 and αLβ2 integrins in leukocytes, and pro-MMP-9 colocalized with αMβ2 in cell surface protrusions. The DDGW peptide and the gelatinase-specific inhibitor peptide CTTHWGFTLC blocked β2 integrin-dependent leukocyte migration in a transwell assay. These results suggest that leukocytes may move in a progelatinase-β2 integrin complex-dependent manner. The αMβ2 integrin of leukocytes can bind a variety of ligands.

These results suggest that leukocytes may move in a progelatinase-β2 integrin complex-dependent manner. The leukocyte integrin family consists of four heterodimeric glycoproteins with specific α-chains (αL, αM, α X , or αD) and a common β2-chain (CD18). They play an essential role in mediating adhesion of cells in the immune system (1Gahmberg C.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The major ligand-binding site locates to a 200-amino acid-long sequence within the α-chain called I or inserted domain, which is homologous to the A domains of von Willebrand factor, repeats of cartilage matrix protein and collagen (2Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1991; 77: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the β2 integrins, αMβ2 is the most promiscuous binder being able to interact with a multitude of unrelated ligands.

The integrin has also been shown to have a capacity to bind certain enzymes, but whether this is important for leukocyte adhesion or immune reactions is unclear. Such enzymes showing integrin-binding activity are catalase (4Davis G.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), myeloperoxidase (5Johansson M.W. Patarroyo M.

Low molecular weight peptides binding to the β2 integrins are useful reagents to study integrin function, and such peptides have been derived from ICAM-2 (11Li R. Xie J. Kantor C. Koistinen V.

We have used phage display libraries to study the peptide binding specificity of integrins and to develop potential drug leads. In our previous study (14Koivunen E. Ranta T.M. Annila A. Taube S. Uppala A. Jokinen M. van Willigen G. Ihanus E. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we isolated the bicyclic peptide CPCFLLGCC (LLG-C4) as the most active binder to the purified αMβ2 integrin. Leukocytes can efficiently adhere to the immobilized LLG-C4 peptide via the αMβ2 and α X β2 integrins. We have now extended phage display screenings to the purified αM I domain. This has resulted in the identification of a novel I domain-binding tetrapeptide motif (D/E)(D/E)(G/L)W, which is found on some of the known β2 integrin ligands and interestingly also on the catalytic domain of MMPs. We show that the (D/E)(D/E)(G/L)W motif mediates binding between an MMP and β2 integrin, and pro-MMP-9 gelatinase, the major MMP of leukocytes (15Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nat. Rev.

Pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 were obtained commercially (Roche Applied Science). In zymography, the commercial pro-MMP-9 showed the 92-kDa monomer, 200-kDa homodimer, and 120-kDa NGAL complex bands. The integrins α1β1 and α3β1 were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Human plasma fibrinogen and lovastatin were from Calbiochem. Phage Display—Phage display selections were made using a pool of random peptides CX 7–10C and X 9–10, where C is a cysteine and X is any amino acid (14Koivunen E. Ranta T.M. Annila A. Taube S.

Briefly, the αM I domain-GST or the GST fusion protein was immobilized on microtiter wells at 20 μg/ml concentrations, and the wells were blocked with BSA. The phage library pool was first subtracted on wells coated with GST, and then unbound phage was transferred to αM I domain-GST-coated wells in 50 mm Hepes, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 2% BSA, pH 7.5. After three rounds of subtraction and selection, individual phage clones were tested for binding specificity, and the sequences of the phage that specifically bound to the I domain were determined (14Koivunen E. Ranta T.M. Annila A. Taube S. Uppala A. Jokinen M. van Willigen G. Ihanus E. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Peptide Biosynthesis and Chemical Synthesis—The phage peptides were initially prepared biosynthetically as intein fusions. The DNA sequences encoding the peptides were PCR-cloned from 1-μl aliquots of the phage-containing bacterial colonies that were stored at –20 °C. The forward primer was 5′-CCTTTCTGCTCTTCCAACGCCGACGGGGCT-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-ACTTTCAACCTGCAGTTACCCAGCGGCCCC-3′. The PCR conditions included initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The PCR products were purified using the Qiagen nucleotide removal kit. They were then digested with SapI and PstI restriction enzymes and ligated to a similarly digested and phosphatase-treated pTWIN vector (New England Biolabs). Correct insertions were verified by DNA sequencing. Intein fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strain ER2566 and affinity-purified on a chitin column essentially as described (26Björklund M. Valtanen H. Savilahti H. Koivunen E. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2003; 6: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The peptide was cleaved on the column, eluted, and finally purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Chemical peptide synthesis was done using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry as described, and the sequences were verified by mass spectroscopy (26Björklund M. Valtanen H. Savilahti H. Koivunen E. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2003; 6: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Phage Binding Assay—Phage (108 infective particles/well) in 50 mm Hepes, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, 0.5% BSA, pH 7.5, were added to microtiter wells coated with I domain-GST fusion or GST (20 ng/well). The phages were allowed to bind in the absence or presence of a competitor peptide (15 μm) for 1 h followed by washings with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. The bound phage was detected using 1:3000 dilution of a peroxidase-labeled monoclonal anti-phage antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride as a substrate. The reactions were stopped by addition of 10% H2SO4, and the absorbance was read at 492 nm using a microplate reader. Pepspot—The peptides were synthesized on cellulose membranes as described (27Heiskanen T. Lundkvist A. Soliymani R. Koivunen E. Vaheri A. Lankinen H. Virology. 1999; 262: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with 3% BSA in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with 0.5–5 μg/ml αM I domain for 2 h at room temperature. The DDGW peptide was used as a competitor at a 50 μm concentration. Bound αM I domain was detected using the monoclonal antibody LM2/1 (1 μg/ml) or MEM170 (5 μg/ml) and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (1:5000 dilution) followed by chemiluminescence detection. Cell Culture—The human HT1080 fibrosarcoma and THP-1 and Jurkat leukemic lines were obtained from ATCC and maintained as described previously (11Li R. Xie J. Kantor C. Koistinen V. Altieri D.C.

Leukemia (Baltimore). 1989; 3: 264-269PubMed Google Scholar), was maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum/RPMI supplemented with l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Cell viability was assessed with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Purification of Integrins—αLβ2 (CD11a/CD18, LFA-1), αMβ2 (CD11b/CD18, Mac-1), and α X β2 (CD11c/CD18) integrins were purified from human blood buffy coat cell lysates by adsorption to the anti-CD11a (TS 2/4), anti-CD11b (MEM170), or anti-CD11c (3.9) antibodies linked to protein A-Sepharose CL 4B. The integrins were eluted at pH 11.5 in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 and 1% n-octyl glucoside as described previously (28Tian L. Yoshihara Y. Mizuno T. Mori K. Gahmberg C.G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 928-936PubMed Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—The αL, αM, and α X I domains were produced as GST fusion proteins in E. coli strains BL 21 or JM109 and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-coupled beads (30Griggs D.W.

GST containing CTT in the C terminus was constructed using the protocols described for LLG-C4-GST (14Koivunen E. Ranta T.M. Annila A. Taube S. Uppala A. Jokinen M. van Willigen G. Ihanus E. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and glutathione-coupled beads were employed for purification. The purity of the GST fusion proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis. For pepspot analysis, GST was cleaved from the αM I domain with thrombin. Binding of MMPs to Purified Integrins—The purified I domains (GST-αM, GST-αL, GST-α X) or integrins (αMβ2, αLβ2, α X β2, α1β1) (1 μg/well) were immobilized in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2,and1mm MnCl2, pH 7.4. The wells were washed with PBST (10 mm phosphate, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20) and blocked with 3% BSA in PBST. Pro-MMP-2, pro-MMP-9, or the p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) or trypsin-activated forms (32Sorsa T. Salo T. Koivunen E. Tyynela J. Konttinen Y.T. Bergmann U. Tuuttila A. Niemi E. Teronen O.

In the inhibition experiments, CTT and Inh1 were first preincubated with the pro-MMPs for 30 min at room temperature. The wells were washed three times and incubated with anti-MMP-9 (GE-213) or anti-MMP-2 (Ab-3) antibody at a 2 μg/ml concentration in PBST for 1 h. Bound antibodies were detected using peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride as a substrate. Coprecipitation of β 2 Integrin and Progelatinases—Serum-free conditioned medium containing pro-MMP-2 and pro-MMP-9 was collected from human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells grown in the presence of 100 nm phorbol ester 4β-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) (Sigma) overnight at +37 °C. A 500-μl volume of the supernatant was incubated with 100 ng of GST-αM, GST-αL, or GST-α X I domain or αMβ2 integrin for 3 h at 25 ° C. GST and GST-LLG-C4 were used to determine non-specific binding. CTT, STT, LLG-C4, and ICAM-1 were used as competitors at a 200 μg/ml concentration and the antibodies LM2/1 and TL3 at 40 μg/ml. After a 1-h incubation at +4 ° C, complexes of I domain and gelatinases were pelleted with glutathione-Sepharose. Integrin complexes were captured by incubating first with the OKM10 antibody for 3 h at +4 ° C and then with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h. After centrifugation and washing, samples were analyzed by gelatin zymography on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.2% gelatin (32Sorsa T. Salo T. Koivunen E. Tyynela J. Konttinen Y.T. Bergmann U. Tuuttila A. Niemi E. Teronen O. Heikkila P. Tschesche H. Leinonen J. Osman S. Stenman U.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21067-21074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Effect of Peptides on Pro-MMP-9 Release from Cells—THP-1 cells (40,000/100 μl) were incubated in serum-free RPMI medium for 48 h in the absence or presence of 200 μm peptide as described in the text. Aliquots of the conditioned media were analyzed by gelatin zymography. Interaction between CTT and Pro-MMP-9 —CTT-GST and GST control (5 μg/well) were coated overnight on 96-well microtiter plates in 50 μl of TBS followed by blocking of the wells by BSA. Pro-MMP-9 or APMA-activated form (80 ng/well) was incubated in the absence or presence of competitors for 2 h in 50 μm Hepes buffer containing 1% BSA, 5 mm CaCl2, and 1 μm ZnCl2, pH 7.5. After washing, bound MMP-9 was determined with anti-MMP-9 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as described above. To examine complexing of CTT with pro-MMP-9 in cell culture, THP-1 cells were activated with PDBu for 30 min and then incubated with CTT, W→ A CTT, or Inh1 (each 200 μm) at +37 ° C in serum-free medium. Samples were taken from the media at 0–5-h time points and analyzed by zymography and Western blotting with polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibodies. Experiments with HT-1080 cells were performed similarly except that the medium samples were collected after 6 h. Cell Surface Labeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting— Non-activated or PDBu-activated THP-1 cells (1 × 107) were subjected to surface labeling using periodate tritiated sodium borohydride (33Gahmberg C.G. Andersson L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5888-5894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3H-labeled cells were lysed with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, clarified by centrifugation, and precleared with protein G-Sepharose. The lysate was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-MMP-9, αM (OKM-10), or β2 (7E4) antibodies. After a 1-h incubation at +4 ° C together with protein G-Sepharose, immunocomplexes were pelleted, washed, and resolved on 8–16% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad). The gels were treated with an enhancer (Amplify, Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed. Non-labeled THP-1 cells (1 × 107) were similarly lysed and immunoprecipitated as above. The samples were resolved on 4–15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunodetection was performed with αM (MEM170) antibody (10 μg/ml) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were stripped of bound antibodies and reprobed with monoclonal αL chain (TS2/4) or polyclonal anti-MMP-9 antibodies. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was performed on resting cells, or the cells were activated with PDBu for 30 min. A portion of the cells was treated with ICAM-1 or CTT to block β2 integrins or gelatinases, respectively. Cells were bound to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, fixed with methanol for 10 min at –20 °C or with 4% paraform-aldehyde for 15 min at +4 °C, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min followed by several washings. The coverslips were incubated with rabbit anti-MMP-9 polyclonal and mouse anti-αM (OKM-10) antibodies diluted 1:500. After washing with PBS, the secondary antibodies, rhodamine (TRITC)-conjugated porcine anti-rabbit or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Fab′)2 (Dakopatts A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) were incubated at a 1:1000 dilution for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were mounted with Mowiol, incubated in the dark for 2 days, and examined by a confocal microscope (Leica multiband confocal imagine spectrophotometer) at a ×400 magnification or a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Provis 70) at a ×60 magnification. Cell Adhesion and Migration—Fibrinogen and ICAM-1-Fc were coated at 40 μg/ml in TBS at +4 °C. Peptides (2 μg/well) were coated in TBS containing 0.25% glutaraldehyde at +37 °C. The wells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. THP-1 cells (50,000/well) with or without PDBu activation were added in 0.1% BSA/RPMI medium in the presence or absence of 200 μm peptides or monoclonal antibodies at 50 μg/ml. After 30–35 min the wells were washed with PBS to remove non-adherent cells, and the adhesive cells were quantitated by a phosphatase assay. The cell migration assay was conducted using transwell migration chambers (8 μm pore size, Costar) in serum-containing medium as described (14Koivunen E. Ranta T.M. Annila A. Taube S. Uppala A. Jokinen M. van Willigen G. Ihanus E. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membranes were coated on the upper and lower surface with 40 μg/ml GST, LLG-C4-GST, or left uncoated. The wells were blocked with 10% serum-containing medium for 2 h. THP-1 cells (50,000/100 μl) or HT1080 (20,000/100 μl) were preincubated with the peptides for 1 h before transfer to the upper chamber. The lower chamber contained 500 μl of the medium without the peptides. The cells were allowed to migrate to the lower surface of the membrane for 16 h and then stained with crystal violet and counted. Identification of the α M I Domain-binding Peptide Motif D/E/D/E-G/L-W—By using phage peptide display libraries, we selected peptides that interact with the αM I domain. GST-binding phage were first eliminated on GST-coated wells, and the unbound phage preparations were incubated on αM I domain GST fusion protein-coated wells. The αM I domain-binding phage were enriched by three rounds of panning, and the peptide sequences were determined. With the exception of one linear peptide, the peptides were derived from the cyclic CX 7C and CX 8C libraries. The I domain-binding sequences showed only one conserved motif, a somewhat unexpected finding in terms of the known ligand binding promiscuity of the I domain. The bound peptides contained two consecutive negatively charged amino acids, i.e. glutamic and/or aspartic acids, followed by glycine and tryptophan residues (Fig. 1A). The consensus (D/E)(D/E)(G/L)W determined by this approach was clearly different from LLG-C4 and other β2 integrin-binding peptides reported so far. We first prepared the phage display peptides as intein fusion proteins, from which the peptides were cleaved. This allowed us to test rapidly the peptide solubility and the binding specificity before large scale chemical peptide synthesis. The peptides were cloned using oligonucleotide primers that amplify the peptide library insert from the phage vector. Consequently, all the peptides prepared contain the vector-derived sequences ADGA and GAAG in the N and C termini, respectively. Phage binding experiments using soluble peptides as competitors indicated that the peptides bearing the two adjacent negative charges bound to a common site (not shown). We chose the peptide ADGA-CILWMDDGWC-GAAG (DDGW) for further experiments as this peptide showed strong binding and was highly soluble in aqueous buffers (soluble in 50 mm NaOH at >10 mm concentrations). The peptide was also prepared by chemical synthesis. The phage bearing the DDGW sequence avidly bound to the αM I domain, and this was readily inhibited by low concentrations of the DDGW peptide, but only marginally affected by the LLG-C4 peptide, indicating different binding sites for DDGW and LLG-C4 (Fig. 1B). Control phage bearing other peptide sequences did not bind. The DDGW-bearing phage also showed also specific binding to the αL I domain that was inhibitable by DDGW, but the interaction was weaker than with the αM I domain (Fig. 1C and data not shown). No binding was observed with the α X I domain or GST used as a control (Fig. 1C). Characterization of DELW Sequence on the Catalytic Domain of Gelatinases That Mediates Interaction with the β 2 Integrin I Domains—We searched protein databases for matches to the novel (D/E)(D/E)(G/L)W motif. One of the phage library-derived peptides, CPEELWWLC, was highly similar to the DELW(S/T)LG sequence present on the catalytic domain of MMP-2 and MMP-9 gelatinases (Fig. 1A). DELW-like sequences with double negative charges are also present in other secreted MMPs but not in the membrane-type MMPs such as MMP-14. No MMP has been reported to bind to the leukocyte β2 integrins. We therefore set out to study whether MMP-9 in particular could be a ligand of the β2 integrins as MMP-9 gelatinase is the major leukocyte MMP and is induced during β2 integrin activation. As a first step, we synthesized the whole pro-MMP-9 sequence as overlapping 20-mer peptides on a pepspot membrane. Binding assays with the αM I domain revealed a single active peptide that located to the MMP-9 catalytic domain (Fig. 1D). No binding was observed when the I domain was omitted, and the membrane was probed with antibodies only. The sequence of the I domain-binding peptide was QGDAHFDDDELWSLGKGVVV, and it contained the binding motif identified by phage display (Fig. 1D). The active MMP-9 peptide contained four consecutive amino acids with negative charges, DDDE. To study the importance of these residues, the aspartic and glutamic acid residues that were closest to the tryptophan were replaced by alanines. At the same time the peptide length was shortened to 15-mer. The alanine mutage"

In this study, we performed deletion and mutational analyses of an IRES contained within the 720-nucleotide (nt) 5′ leader of the Rbm3 mRNA and demonstrated that this IRES is highly modular, with at least 9 discrete cis-acting sequences. These cis-acting sequences include a 22-nt IRES module, a 10-nt enhancer, and 2 inhibitory sequences. The 22-nt sequence was shown to function as an IRES when tested in isolation, and we demonstrated that it did not enhance translation by functioning as a transcriptional promoter, enhancer, or splice site. The activities of all 4 cis-acting sequences were further confirmed by their mutation in the context of the full IRES. Interestingly, one of the inhibitory cis-acting sequences is contained within an upstream open reading frame (uORF), and its activity seems to be masked by translation of this uORF. Binding studies revealed that all 4 cis-acting sequences could bind specifically to distinct cytoplasmic proteins. In addition, the 22-nt IRES module was shown to bind specifically to 40 S ribosomal subunits. The results demonstrate that different types of cis-acting sequences mediate or modulate translation of the Rbm3 mRNA and suggest that one of the IRES modules contained within the 5′ leader facilitates translation initiation by binding directly to 40 S ribosomal subunits.

The cap-dependent mechanism for initiating translation is generally thought to be more common; however, the number of mRNAs reported to initiate translation internally is growing (3Bonnal S. Boutonnet C. Prado-Lourenco L. Vagner S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 427-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Internal initiation seems to facilitate the translation of particular viral and cellular mRNAs under conditions or subcellular locations that render the cap-dependent mechanism less efficient, for example, during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, under conditions of mild hypothermia, or in dendrites (4Pyronnet S.

Although IRESes are defined by using operational criteria, such as the ability to enhance second cistron translation when tested in the intercistronic region of a dicistronic mRNA (8Jackson R.J. Hunt S.L. Reynolds J.E. Kaminski A. Sarnow P. Operational Distinctions and Mechanistic Interpretations. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 203Google Scholar), various lines of evidence indicate that they comprise a diverse group of sequences that may recruit the translation machinery by a variety of mechanisms (1Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Lomakin I.B. Pilipenko E.V. Shatsky I.N. Agol V.I. Hellen C.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7029-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 2Vagner S. Galy B. Pyronnet S. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Accumulated data also suggest that there are intrinsic differences between viral and cellular IRESes. Picornavirus IRESes, for example, seem to be highly structured, well defined functional entities of up to several hundred nucleotides. These IRESes have been categorized on the basis of sequence and structural similarities, and some of these features have been shown to be functionally important (9Jackson R.J. Kaminski A. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 985-1000PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, cellular IRESes do not seem to contain conserved secondary structures, and their sequences are not obviously similar to each other or to viral IRESes. A feature noted in some cellular but not in viral IRESes is that they seem to be composed of shorter elements that can function independently when tested in isolation (10Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11Zhou W. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The modular nature of some cellular IRESes is suggested by numerous observations. For example, it has been difficult to define discrete 5′ and 3′ boundaries for particular cellular IRESes. Moreover, the activity of some cellular IRESes seems to be contained within two or more nonoverlapping fragments (e.g. Refs. 13Yang Q. Sarnow P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9356-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In our analysis of the Gtx 5′ leader, we identified four nonoverlapping fragments that functioned as IRESes (10Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and the activity of one of these fragments was contained within a 9-nt segment. Other short nucleotide sequences that function as IRESes include two cis-acting sequences selected from libraries of random nucleotides (18Owens G.C. Chappell S.A. Mauro V.P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1471-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and short GA-rich repeats, which were shown to function as IRESes in both plants and animals (19Dorokhov Y.L. Skulachev M.V. Ivanov P.A. Zvereva S.D. Tjulkina L.G. Merits A. Gleba Y.Y. Hohn T. Atabekov J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5301-5306Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The 9-nt Gtx IRES module is complementary to a segment of 18 S rRNA, and we previously showed that this sequence could bind directly to 40 S ribosomal subunits by base pairing to its rRNA complement (20Hu M.C.-Y. Tranque P. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In other studies, we noted that many cellular mRNAs contain segments with complementarity to rRNA (21Mauro V.P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and showed that numerous short complementary matches also occur in both cellular and synthetic IRESes (6Chappell S.A. Owens G.C. Mauro V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36917-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Zhou W. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 1471-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Other studies showed that complementary mRNA sequences could bind to ribosomes and affect the translation of the host mRNA (e.g. Refs. 22Tranque P. Hu M.C.-Y. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12238-12243Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and 23Verrier S.B. Jean-Jean O. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 584-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These observations prompted the ribosome filter hypothesis, which postulates that the ribosomal subunits themselves are regulatory elements that modulate patterns of protein expression by reducing the translation of some mRNAs while enhancing that of others (12Mauro V.P. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12031-12036Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition to recruiting ribosomes directly, we expect that some IRES elements might recruit ribosomes indirectly by binding to initiation factors or other trans-factors. In a previous study, we noted that a 720-nt 5′ leader of the cold stress-induced Rbm3 mRNA, which encodes a putative RNA-binding protein, contains 13 uORFs (6Chappell S.A. Owens G.C. Mauro V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36917-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although uORFs should block translation of the main ORF (24Meijer H.A. Thomas A.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 25Geballe A.P. Sachs M.S. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 595-614Google Scholar), translation of a reporter mRNA containing the Rbm3 5′ leader was relatively efficient. The identification of an IRES within this 5′ leader suggested a mechanism by which the uORFs were bypassed. In our initial characterization of this IRES, its activity was confirmed by using a number of criteria, both in cells and in cell-free lysates. The notion that short nucleotide motifs may be key elements controlling the activity of some cellular IRESes is further developed in the present study. DNA Constructs—Reporter constructs were based on vectors that use the simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter to transcribe a dicistronic mRNA that encodes Renilla and Photinus luciferases as the first and second cistrons, respectively. These vectors were kindly provided by Dr. Anne E. Willis (14Stoneley M. Paulin F.E.M. Le Quesne J.P.C. Chappell S.A. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), who subsequently renamed them pRF and phpRF (hairpin). For consistency with our previous publications, we use the alternative nomenclature of RP and RPh, respectively. Fragments of the Rbm3 5′ leader were generated by PCR amplification using Pfu DNA polymerase with either the full-length Rbm3 5′ leader or oligonucleotides as templates and cloned into the intercistronic region of the RP or RPh vectors. Amplification oligonucleotides for cloning into RP contained EcoRI and NcoI restriction sites, whereas oligonucleotide templates for cloning into RPh contained SpeI and EcoRI. The 5′-nucleotides flanking the Rbm3 sequences in the 5′ deletion series are ACUAGU. In some deletions, the 5′-nucleotide of the Rbm3 sequence is U and overlaps with the 3′-nucleotide from the 5′-flanking sequence. Oligonucleotides containing various combinations of the AclI, HindIII, and NcoI restriction sites were used to introduce mutations into the full-length Rbm3 5′ leader by replacement of wild-type sequences. To generate promoterless dicistronic constructs, the SV40 promoter was excised using BglII and BlnI restriction sites. Particular fragments and mutations of the Rbm3 5′ leader were also tested in a monocistronic context 5′ of the Photinus luciferase cistron. mRNA levels in these constructs were estimated by using a second cistron which encodes a synthetic Renilla luciferase protein (R′, Promega) expressed via the IRES of the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (P(EMCV)R′). This construct was modified from the P(EMCV)-CAT construct (6Chappell S.A. Owens G.C. Mauro V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36917-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) by replacement of the second cistron (CAT) with the synthetic Renilla luciferase. Transfection and Cell-free Analyses—Reporter constructs (0.5 μg) were transfected into cells (1 × 105) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cell lines were mouse neuroblastoma N2a, rat glial tumor C6, mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 (3T3), and human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH (SK). Transfection efficiencies were normalized by cotransfection with 0.2 μg of a LacZ reporter gene construct (pCMVβ, CLONTECH). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and reporter gene activities were determined (10Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Note that, in this paper, the Photinus:Renilla luciferase expression ratio is referred to as IRES activity, even for putative cis-acting sequences. For cell-free translation studies, capped dicistronic mRNAs were transcribed by using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Translation reactions were performed by using 0.5 μg of mRNA in the presence or absence of 0.2 mm cap analogue (m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G, Roche Diagnostics) in C6 cell-free lysates (6Chappell S.A. Owens G.C.

A. 1999; 96: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). mRNA integrity and size after translation were determined by Northern blot analyses (26Stoneley M. Chappell S.A. Jopling C.L. Dickens M. MacFarlane M. Willis A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1162-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) using a Photinus luciferase riboprobe. Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift and Nitrocellulose Filter Binding Analyses—RNA oligonucleotides (Dharmacon Research Inc.) were 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP with T4 polynucleotide kinase and tested in electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays based on the method previously described (27Paulin F.E.M. Chappell S.A. Willis A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3097-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) using cytoplasmic extracts prepared from N2a, C6, or 3T3 cells (20Hu M.C.-Y. Tranque P. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Labeled RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to cis-acting sequences with complementarity to 18 S rRNA were tested for their ability to bind to puromycin-dissociated N2a ribosomes and purified C6 40 S ribosomal subunits (28Blobel G. Sabatini D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) in nitrocellulose filter binding assays (based on Ref. 29Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) using 1.25 mm MgCl2 in the binding buffer. Nonspecific competitor RNA (SI/SIII) was based on mouse β-globin 5′ leader sequences and poly(A) (10Chappell S.A. Edelman G.M. Mauro V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1536-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The relative amounts of probe retained on nitrocellulose membranes was quantified with a Phosphor-Imager (Amersham Biosciences). The Rbm3 IRES Contains Numerous Segments That Function Independently and Contribute to Overall Activity—To determine whether the Rbm3 IRES contains a discrete 5′ boundary, the full-length Rbm3 5′ leader and sequential deletions of ∼100 nucleotides from its 5′ end were tested in dicistronic constructs in four cell lines (Fig. 1). In the cell lines tested, the IRES activity of the Rbm3 5′ leader was up to ∼50-fold over the background level of activity obtained with the parent construct RP. Sequential deletions of this 5′ leader progressively reduced IRES activity and indicated that the Rbm3 IRES does not contain a discrete 5′ boundary; this suggests that IRES activity is derived from the summation of a series of shorter functional elements that are distributed throughout the Rbm3 5′ leader rather than from a single, well defined functional entity. This suggested modular composition was further investigated by arbitrarily fragmenting the 720-nt 5′ leader into seven segments (Fig. 1, I–VII) and testing these for IRES activity. Six of the fragments had IRES activity at least 2-fold over background in at least one cell line. In addition, the activities of two of the fragments (V and VII) varied in the different cell lines. Both were active in SK cells and inactive in C6 and 3T3 cells; however, in N2a cells, fragment V was active and VII was inactive. Fragment III was the most active segment in all four cell lines, and in two cell lines (N2a and SK) it was more active than the full IRES. In a previous publication, we showed that the 5′ leader of the Rbm3 mRNA functioned as an IRES in a cell-free lysate and that the activities obtained were not caused by the production of monocistronic mRNAs corresponding to the second cistron (6Chappell S.A. Owens G.C. Mauro V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36917-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this study, we noted that the activity of one of the 100-nt fragments (III) was greater than that of the full-length 5′ leader in N2a and SK cells. We sought to fine-map the cis-acting elements contained within this fragment; however, before proceeding, we performed an additional control. To ensure that the enhanced activity obtained with the construct containing fragment III was not caused by promoter activity leading to the production of monocistronic Photinus luciferase mRNAs, we deleted the SV40 promoter from the Rbm3(III)/RP construct (Fig. 2A). After transfection into N2a cells, the activities of both cistrons were reduced to a background level compared with the activities obtained from the Rbm3(III)/RP construct containing the SV40 promoter, demonstrating that the activities obtained from fragment III were not caused by promoter activity. To begin to identify cis-acting sequences within fragment III, it was deleted and fragmented at intervals of ∼20 nucleotides (Fig. 2B). As in our original characterization of the Rbm3 IRES, we included a hairpin structure in the 5′ leader of these constructs to minimize the contribution of the first cistron through reinitiation or leaky scanning. In these experiments, one of the 20-nt segments (III-g) had a level of IRES activity ∼5-fold over the background level of activity obtained with the parent construct RPh, but its activity was enhanced dramatically by nucleotide sequences located immediately 3′ of it (Fig. 2B, compare fragments III-g to III-c), even though the 3′ sequences themselves (III-d) had no detectable IRES activity. These results may indicate that fragment III-g contains a truncated IRES module; alternatively, the nucleotides 3′ of III-g contain an independent cis-acting sequence that enhances the activity of the IRES module. A 100-nt Fragment Contains Four cis-Acting Sequences That Affect IRES Activity—Sequential deletion of fragment III in steps of 1–5 nucleotides in a 5′ to 3′ direction revealed two activities (Fig. 3A, constructs d1–d14). The first, observed with deletion d4, resulted in an almost complete loss of IRES activity, although activity was recovered by deletion of an additional 4 nucleotides. Deletion d4 destroyed the putative initiation codon of a 15-nt uORF; the effects of this uORF on translation are addressed later. The second activity, observed with deletion d8, resulted in diminished IRES activity and localized the 5′ boundary of a putative IRES module to nucleotide U–286. Deletion of the next five nucleotides (d10) decreased IRES activity further, and activity was completely lost with deletion d11 (nucleotide U–277). The 3′ boundary of the cis-acting sequence defined by the 5′ deletions d8–d11 was determined by mutating 3′ sequences to adenosine. The use of mutations rather than deletions avoids any changes in activity related to the spacing of cis-acting sequences relative to the downstream cistron. Sequential 3′ to 5′ mutations of fragment d6 (Fig. 3A, m1–m12) localized the 3′ boundary of a putative IRES module to nucleotide A–265 (m2), with a level of activity ∼8-fold over background. We refer to the segment defined by nucleotides U–286 to A–265 as the putative 22-nt IRES module. Mutation of fragment III also revealed two other activities. An inhibitory sequence is contained between nucleotides C–228 and U–242, and mutation of these nucleotides increased IRES activity from ∼40-fold to ∼90-fold over background (Fig. 3A, compare d6 to m10). The 3′ boundary of a second cis-acting sequence was localized 16 nucleotides 3′ of the putative 22-nt IRES module to G–249 (m8). These 16 nucleotides enhanced IRES activity more than 9-fold (Fig. 3A, compare m2 to m8), even though they did not have detectable IRES activity by themselves (d14). To address whether these 16 nucleotides represent the 3′ end of a putative IRES module or contain a discrete enhancer element, nucleotides located immediately 3′ of the putative IRES module were sequentially mutated to adenosine (m13–m19). Mutation of the first 7 nucleotides (m13–m16) diminished IRES activity somewhat from ∼40-fold to ∼30-fold over background; however, activity was still enhanced relative to that of the putative IRES module (Fig. 3A, compare m16 to m2). These results suggest the existence of a discrete enhancer element with a 5′ boundary at nucleotide G–257 (m16). To investigate this possibility further, the spacing between the putative IRES module and enhancer sequences was varied by using poly(A). Mutation of the 7 nucleotides between the putative IRES module and enhancer sequences (m20) resulted in a level of IRES activity comparable with that of m16, even though these constructs differ in their 3′ sequences: m20 contains a stretch of poly(A), and m16 contains Rbm3 sequences. When the putative IRES module was spaced 9, 11, or 19 nucleotides from the sequences with enhancer activity (m21–m23, respectively), IRES activity was still enhanced relative to the activity of the putative IRES module alone (m2 or m19), indicating that the IRES and enhancer activities are separable. However, these activities were not completely independent, as the enhancer did not function when tested 5′ of the putative IRES module (data not shown). Therefore, we refer to this segment as the 3′ enhancer element. The 22-nt Putative IRES Module Functions Independently—To control for the possibility that deletions and mutations generated an IRES element (for example, by juxtaposition of intercistronic and Rbm3 sequences), we tested the putative 22-nt IRES module in isolation and observed that this sequence also seemed to function as an IRES. Its activity was 115-fold over background in N2a cells (Fig. 3A, 22-nt), 86-fold in C6 cells, 95-fold in 3T3 cells, and 46-fold in SK cells. The activity of the 22-nt IRES module is up to ∼15-fold greater than that of the EMCV IRES. In addition, these activities were greater than those observed for the full-length IRES or those expected from the results of the deletion and mutational analyses. The results suggest that the activity of the putative 22-nt IRES module may be affected by flanking sequences or by its spacing relative to the Photinus luciferase initiation codon, both of which differ in these particular constructs. In summary, deletions and mutations of fragment III identified four cis-acting sequences that affected its translation, which together are schematically represented in Fig. 3B. The 22-nt Putative IRES Module Is Confirmed to Be an IRES by Various Criteria—To validate that the 22-nt cis-acting sequence functions as an IRES, we excluded other possibilities that might yield similar results, i.e. the possibility that this sequence functions as a transcriptional promoter, enhancer, or splice site that leads to the production of monocistronic second cistron mRNAs. The possibility of promoter or enhancer activities was considered unlikely because the 22-nt cis-acting sequence accounts for the activity of fragment III, and fragment III was shown not to function as a promoter in Fig. 2A. However, to further investigate this possibility, we also showed that the activity of the 22-nt cis-acting sequence depended on the production of the dicistronic mRNA (data not shown). In addition, we tested this sequence in a cell-free translation reaction (Fig. 4), which also addressed the possibility that the putative 22-nt IRES module might generate monocistronic Photinus luciferase mRNAs by functioning as a splice site that results in excision of the first cistron. For these experiments, dicistronic mRNAs were transcribed and capped in vitro and translated in cell-free lysates that lack nuclear splicing factors. The 22-nt cis-acting sequence increased translation of the second cistron relative to a control mRNA (RP) lacking these sequences by ∼70-fold. This translation was cap-independent because it was not blocked by the presence of a cap analogue, which decreased the translation of the first cistron by ∼80% (Fig. 4A). These results also indicate that the 22-nt sequence does not facilitate translation of the second cistron by mechanisms that depend on translation of the first cistron (e.g. reinitiation). In fact, when translation of the first cistron was blocked, second cistron expression actually increased by ∼1.8-fold. Nuclease hypersensitivity or splicing activities in these lysates were monitored by Northern analysis of the dicistronic reporter mRNAs after in vitro translation (Fig. 4B). The results showed no obvious differences in either mRNA integrity or size after 60 min of incubation. Taken together, the observations from the transfection and cell-free studies confirm that the 22-nt cis-acting sequence functions as an IRES. Translation of a uORF Appears to Mask an Inhibitory cisActing Sequence—The presence of a fourth cis-sequence, located upstream of the IRES module, was suggested from deletion d4 (Fig. 3A). This deletion destroyed a putative initiation codon for a 15-nt uORF and led to an almost complete loss of IRES activity. However, deletion of the next 4 nucleotides (d5) restored activity, suggesting that translation of this uORF was not required for activity but rather masked an inhibitory sequence that overlaps the first 5 nucleotides. To investigate this possibility, this uORF was disrupted by mutating its initiation codon from AUG to UUG, CUG, AAG, or AUA (Fig. 5A, m24–m27, respectively) and tested in the intercistronic region of a dicistronic mRNA in N2a cells. In this context, all four mutations inhibited IRES activity by ∼60–80%, consistent with the notion that translation of the uORF masks an inhibitory activity. However, using dicistronic mRNAs, it is not possible to distinguish between a loss of IRES activity and an inhibition of translation, because the second cistron is translated at a background level in the absence of an IRES. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested the IRES sequences in the 5′ leader of a monocistronic mRNA, which is translated at a high level even in the absence of the IRES (Fig. 5B, m28–m31). In this context, fragment III increased translation by ∼30% relative to the parent cons"
https://openalex.org/W1990398484,"To understand the mechanisms of G protein-coupled receptor delivery and steady state localization, we examined the trafficking itineraries of wild type (WT) and mutant V2 vasopressin receptors (V2Rs) in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCK II) cells and in COS M6 cells; the mutant V2Rs represent selected alleles responsible for X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The WT V2R is localized on the plasma membrane and mediates arginine vasopressin (AVP)-stimulated cAMP accumulation, whereas the clinically relevant V2R mutants, L292P V2R, ΔV278 V2R, and R337X V2R, are retained intracellularly, are insensitive to extracellularly added AVP, and are not processed beyond initial immature glycosylation, manifest by their endoglycosidase H sensitivity. Reduced temperature and pharmacological, but not chemical, strategies rescue mutant V2Rs to the cell surface of COS M6 cells; surface rescue of L292P V2R and R337X V2R, but not of ΔV278 V2R, parallels acquisition of AVP-stimulated cAMP production. Pharmacological rescue of the L292P or R337X V2R by incubation with the membrane-permeant V2R antagonist, SR121463B, leads to a mature glycosylated form of the receptor that achieves localization on the basolateral surface of polarized MDCK II cells indistinguishable from that of the WT V2R. Surprisingly, however, the immature form of the mutant L292P V2R escapes to the apical, but not basolateral, surface of polarized MDCK II cells, even in the absence of SR121463B. These findings are consistent with the interpretation that the receptor conformation that allows appropriate processing through the N-linked glycosylation pathway is also essential for V2R targeting to the appropriate surface of polarized epithelial cells.

However, less attention has focused on the molecular mechanisms accounting for how receptors achieve localization in the agonist-naive state. A key determinant governing the specificity of GPCR signaling entails appropriate receptor localization on the cell surface, permitting access to requisite ligands and signal transduction machinery. Cell surface localization is governed by two predominant mechanisms: 1) receptor delivery to a particular site and 2) retention at that site. The functional importance of GPCR localization is emphasized by diseases that result from receptor mislocalization, such as retinitis pigmentosa, X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (3Leanos-Miranda A. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 4825-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which result from intracellular accumulation of mutant rhodopsin, the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R), or the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, respectively. Our previous studies have exploited α2-AR subtypes as a model for characterization of GPCR trafficking and localization because of their different trafficking itineraries in polarized cells and in response to agonist (reviewed in Ref. 4Saunders C. Limbird L.E. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 84: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). All three α2-AR subtypes (α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-AR) are located, at steady state, at the basolateral surface in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cells, analogous to their localization in vivo (5Keefer J.R.

Whereas the α2A-AR and α2C-AR are directly targeted to the basolateral surface, the α2B-AR is randomly distributed to both the apical and basolateral surface and then selectively retained at the lateral subdomain (6Wozniak M. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5017-5024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Truncations of the α2A-AR and chimeras with the apically targeted A1 adenosine receptor reveal that α2A-AR targeting to the basolateral surface relies upon multiple, non-contiguous, membrane-embedded sequences within or near the lipid bilayer (7Keefer J.R. Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16425-16432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Saunders C. Keefer J.R. Bonner C.A. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24196-24206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that a three-dimensional surface provides the basis for interaction with trafficking molecules. Consequently, it can be reasoned that no single linear sequence can be exploited to identify receptor targeting machinery. Thus, to elucidate the mechanisms involved in basolateral delivery of GPCRs, we explored the human V2R and naturally occurring point mutations in the V2R responsible for the pathogenesis of X-linked NDI. Many of the >160 human mutations described to date cause the receptor to be retained intracellularly (9Oksche A. Rosenthal W. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), unresponsive to its physiological ligand arginine vasopressin (AVP). We examined the trafficking and localization of the wild type V2R and three intracellularly retained V2R mutants to assess whether these mutants could be spatially and functionally rescued and whether cell surface rescue was also paralleled by localization on the appropriate surface of polarized MDCK II cells. Materials—Human wild type (WT) and mutant V2R cDNAs were graciously provided by Dr. Jürgen Wess or were constructed by overlap extension PCR mutagenesis. EASYTAG [35S]-EXPRE35SS protein labeling mix (1175 Ci/mmol), [2,8-3H]adenine (30.4 Ci/mmol), 8-arginine [phenylalanyl-3,4,5-3H]vasopressin (68.5 Ci/mmol), [8-14C]adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic phosphate ammonium salt (51.2 mCi/mmol), [methoxy-3H]inulin-methoxy (430 mCi/g), EN3HANCE autoradiography enhancer, and Entensify™ autoradiography enhancer were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DEAE-dextran was from Amersham Biosciences. Paraformaldehyde (16% solution, EM grade) was from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Washington, PA). Polyvinylidene difluoride nylon membranes were from Millipore Corp. (Bedford, MA). Dowex AG50 W-X4 resin, 40% acrylamide, TEMED, and ammonium persulfate were from Bio-Rad. Adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (sodium salt), alumina, aprotinin, [Arg8]vasopressin (acetate salt), bacitracin, bovine serum albumin, chloroquine (diphosphate salt), fetal calf serum, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and Triton X-100 were from Sigma. The protein A-purified mouse 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (1 μg/μl) and mouse HA.11 monoclonal antibody (5 μg/μl) directed against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag engineered into the amino terminus of the various V2R structures was obtained from Babco, and the Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (2 μg/μl) was from Jackson Immunochemicals (West Grove, PA). Rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (100 μg/ml; clone 3F10) against the HA epitope tag was obtained from Roche Applied Science, and the Alexafluor-488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (2 μg/μl) was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Protein A-agarose beads were from Vector (Burlingame, CA). EZ-link™ sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-Biotin and Immunopure™ immobilized streptavidin-agarose were from Pierce. The 12- and 24.5-mm polycarbonate membrane filters (Transwell chambers; 0.4-μm pore size) were obtained from Costar (Cambridge, MA). Aqua-Poly/Mount was from PolySciences Inc. (Warrington, PA). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and trypsin/EDTA were prepared by the cell culture core facility sponsored by the Diabetes Research and Training Center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Cell Lines—Permanent clonal MDCK II cell lines expressing HA epitope-tagged WT and mutant V2Rs were developed using the CaPO4 method as described previously (7Keefer J.R. Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16425-16432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of V2pcD-N-HA, pCMV4N-V2R-L292P, pCMV4N-V2R-R337X, or pCMV4N-V2R-ΔV278 (individual cDNAs encoding HA epitope-tagged human wild type (WT) or mutant (L292P, R337X, and ΔV278) V2Rs, respectively) were each co-transfected with 2 μg of pRSVneo (cDNA encoding neomycin resistance) into MDCK II cells. Colonies were selected based on resistance to G418, a neomycin analog, and isolated as described previously (7Keefer J.R. Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16425-16432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G418-resistant colonies were screened for WT V2R expression by assaying binding of the radioligand [3H]AVP. V2R mutant-expressing cell lines were screened via immunofluorescence against the HA epitope, using either the mouse 12CA5 monoclonal antibody or the rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Parental and stably expressing WT V2R MDCK II cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Simian kidney fibroblast (COS M6) cells were maintained in supplemented DMEM plus 20 mm HEPES. The studies presented were obtained in the WT V2R clonal cell line number 61, which expresses the HA epitope-tagged WT V2R at a density of 12.6 pmol of specific [3H]AVP binding/mg of protein, estimated in saturation binding studies. Binding density could not be determined for the mutant V2R cell lines because a decreased V2R affinity inherent to the L292P V2R and R337X V2R means that [3H]AVP binding is untrappable for these receptors. Further, we have no evidence that the ΔV278 V2R binds AVP, since AVP-stimulated cAMP production is not observed following temperature or pharmacological rescue of this mutant receptor to the surface of COS M6 cells. However, relative V2R density could be qualitatively obtained by immunoblotting for the HA epitope in resolved lysates derived from cells expressing the heterologous V2Rs. If WT V2R total cell content under control conditions is defined as 1.0, then L292P (clone 30F) is 0.28 of the density of WT-expressing MDCK II cells in the absence of SR121463B rescue and 0.31 of this density after pharmacological rescue. The R337X V2R is 0.55 of control V2R expression but increases to 1.18 of control V2R expression with SR121463B treatment. For comparison, the WT V2R increases its total cell content from 1.0 (as defined) under control conditions to 1.06 following overnight SR121463B treatment. Transient Expression Studies—COS M6 cells were seeded the day prior to transfection at a density of 3.5 × 105 (35-mm dish), 2.0 × 106 (100-mm dish), or 4.5 × 106 (150-mm dish). On the day of transfection, cells were rinsed in PBS prior to incubation with a mixture containing 0.67, 4, or 9 μg of plasmid DNA, respectively, with 500 μg/ml DEAE-dextran for 20 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The DNA/DEAE-dextran mixture was aspirated and replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and 100 μm chloroquine and maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 h. At this time, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were subjected to an Me2SO shock (10% Me2SO in DMEM, 3 min at 37 °C) before replacing with 10% serum-supplemented DMEM plus 20 mm HEPES prior to assessment 72 h post-transfection. Sulfo-NHS-Biotin Surface Labeling Strategy—Assessment of steady-state localization of the WT V2R, R337X V2R, and L292P V2R in stably expressing MDCK II cell lines was accomplished via covalent labeling of the apical or basolateral surface of polarized MDCK II cells with sulfo-NHS-biotin exactly as described previously. Integrity of the cell monolayer was determined via [3H]methoxyinulin leak assays (7Keefer J.R. Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16425-16432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Delivery to Cell Surfaces of Polarized MDCK II Cells—Delivery of nascent V2R to the cell surface was examined by metabolic labeling and surface biotinylation strategies, essentially as described previously (6Wozniak M. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5017-5024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 7Keefer J.R. Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16425-16432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polarized MDCK II cells expressing WT V2R were incubated in cysteine/methionine-free medium for 2 h prior to a 90-min pulse in Cys/Met-free medium supplemented with 1 μCi/μl [35S]-EXPRE35SS protein labeling mix. At the end of the pulse phase, Transwells were biotinylated at either the apical or basolateral surface with two sequential rounds of sulfo-NHS-Biotin (1 mg/ml). Cells were extracted into ice-cold dodecyl-β-d-maltoside/cholesteryl hemisuccinate buffer (4 and 0.8 mg/ml, respectively, containing 20% glycerol, 25 mm glycylglycine, 20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant was sequentially incubated with mouse 12CA5 anti-HA antibody (1:50) and adsorbed to protein A and streptavidin-agarose (10Wilson M.H. Limbird L.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The washed resin was eluted with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and the above protease inhibitors at 90 °C. The biotinylated protein eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were incubated for 60 min in EN3HANCE prior to drying and exposure to Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat film. Data shown are from autoradiograms. Surface Localization of V2R—Biotinylation strategies also can allow quantitation of the relative amount of surface versus internalized receptors (MDCK II; COS M6), or apical versus basolateral receptors (MDCK II), even without metabolic labeling. For these studies, one 60-mm dish of COS M6 cells or the appropriate number of 24.5-mm Transwells of polarized (7 days of growth) WT or mutant V2R in MDCK II cells were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-biotin (1 mg/ml) on the apical or basolateral surface as described previously (6Wozniak M. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5017-5024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 7Keefer J.R. Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16425-16432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MDCK II cells plated in Transwells were pretreated overnight with 10 μm SR121463B to achieve pharmacological rescue or not (control) prior to surface biotinylation. The cells were scraped into radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with protease inhibitors present, and the extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The supernatant (detergent-solubilized preparation) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with streptavidin-agarose. The streptavidin-agarose resin was washed and eluted as above (10Wilson M.H. Limbird L.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and the eluate was resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. The resolved proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride as described previously, and the biotinylated, epitope-tagged V2R was identified by Western blot analysis using mouse HA.11 monoclonal antibody against the HA epitope. Digestion of V2R with Endoglycosidases—Proteins were eluted from protein A-agarose (for Fig. 10) or from streptavidin agarose (data not shown) using a buffer consisting of 0.5% SDS and 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Endoglycosidase treatment was according to the protocol provided by New England Biolabs. Briefly, protein eluates were treated with Endoglycosidase H (1000 units) in G5 enzyme buffer (0.05 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5) or treated with peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (1000 units) in G7 enzyme buffer (0.05 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, plus 1% Nonidet P-40). Incubations were for 30–60 min at 37 °C. Immunolocalization of the Wild Type and Mutant V2R—Stably expressing WT V2R MDCK II cells or transiently transfected COS M6 cells were grown on 12-mm glass coverslips (COS M6 cells) or in 12-mm Transwell chambers (MDCK II cells) and maintained for 2 days (coverslips) or 5 days (Transwells) prior to fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were washed in PBS, rinsed with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 15 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Intact and permeabilized cells were washed once with PBS and once with PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin prior to incubation with a 1:50 dilution of mouse 12CA5 monoclonal primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing cells three times in PBS (10 min/wash), a 1:1000 dilution of Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG in PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin was added as the secondary antibody to the cells and incubated in the dark for 1 h at room temperature. In some studies, a 1:1000 dilution of rat anti-HA monoclonal primary antibody and a 1:1000 dilution of secondary Alexafluor-488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG were employed. Cells were then washed prior to mounting on glass slides with Aqua-Poly/Mount. The figure legends indicate whether mouse 12CA5 or rat anti-HA was used as the primary antibody. Slides were stored in the dark until examining on a Leitz fluorescent microscope using a 40× oil immersion lens at 1.5× magnification or on a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser-scanning inverted microscope in the Vanderbilt Cell Imaging Core Facility. cAMP Accumulation—Basal or AVP-mediated cAMP accumulation in intact cells was measured by assessing the conversion of [3H]ATP into [3H]cAMP. COS M6 cells in 150-mm dishes were trypsinized the day following transfection and seeded into 24-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, the cell culture medium was aspirated, and wells were labeled overnight (12–16 h at 37 °C) with 3 μCi/ml [3H]adenine in DMEM, DMEM plus 10% glycerol, or DMEM plus 10 μm SR121463B. To assess the ability of reduction in culture temperature to enhance surface expression of mutant V2R, [3H]adenine-labeled cells were maintained for 12–16 h at 28 °C; wild type cells were treated similarly and served as controls. Functional studies of AVP-stimulated cAMP production before and after rescue were restricted to COS M6 cells. Although we could achieve surface rescue with SR121463B in MDCK II cells, we were not able to observe AVP-stimulated cAMP accumulation in polarized (Transwell) or unpolarized (plated) MDCK II cultures following overnight treatment with SR121463B due to inadequate wash-out of this membranepermeant antagonist. Rescue by lowering culture temperature is not efficient in MDCK II cells, in contrast to COS M6 cells. Using the concentration response for AVP-stimulated cAMP accumulation in WT cells as a monitor of residual SR121463B, we found that wash protocols that had successfully removed SR121463B in COS M6 cell experiments to allow subsequent detection of AVP-stimulated cAMP accumulation were not sufficient in removing the V2R antagonist from MDCK II cells. Residual antagonist masked AVP-stimulated cAMP accumulation, even in WT V2R-expressing cells, which are highly sensitive to AVP. Extended wash protocols with or without bovine serum albumin and/or serum also did not successfully remove residual SR121463B from MDCK II cells after overnight incubation. We do not have an explanation for this observation other than the realization that the density of V2Rs in MDCK II cells (∼12 pmol/mg for WT V2R) represents the density of the receptor in all cells, since this is a clonal cell line, whereas the apparent density (also ∼12 pmol/mg for WT V2R) in transiently expressing COS M6 cells represents a mean of all densities for cells overexpressing the receptor (i.e. ≫ 12 pmol/mg) and cells expressing no receptor. Perhaps the high receptor expression per cell in COS M6 cells fosters receptor sensitivity to AVP even in the presence of some residual SR121463B. Forskolin does elevate cAMP in WT and mutant V2R-expressing MDCK II cells before and after SR121463B treatment, indicating that the adenylyl cyclase system is operative in the cells and that our assay is able to detect cAMP changes in MDCK II cells if they occur. AVP also readily stimulates cAMP production in WT V2R-expressing MDCK II cells when not pretreated with SR121463B as a “rescue” treatment. On the day of the assay of cAMP accumulation, COS M6 cells were incubated with prewarmed cell culture medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin followed by a single wash with medium. Cells were then washed with prewarmed PBS and incubated with PBS plus 500 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, for 5 min. Following aspiration, cells were treated with selected concentrations of AVP for 15 min in a final assay volume of 200 μl. Reactions were terminated by adding 750 μl of an ice-cold solution containing 12% trichloroacetic acid, 2 mm cAMP, 2 mm ATP, and [14C]cAMP (∼1600 cpm/ml) to permit an assessment of recovery of [3H]cAMP in subsequent purification steps. Cells were then placed on ice for 10 min, after which the reactions were transferred to glass test tubes using disposable transfer pipettes. Each well was washed with 1.05 ml of H2O and combined with its respective harvested sample. After neutralization with 120 μl of 5 n NaOH, cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatants were subjected to sequential Dowex and alumina column chromatography to isolate [3H]cAMP. Data are presented as [3H]cAMP/([3H]ATP + [3H]ADP). The value of [3H]ATP + [3H]ADP was estimated from the 3H cpm eluted from the Dowex column as pass-through (11Johnson R.A. Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To compare trafficking of the HA epitope-tagged WT V2R (referred to as WT V2R throughout) with clinically relevant V2R mutations, we examined the localization of these structures following transient expression in COS M6 cells. Immunostaining of intact cells (no Triton X-100 in the incubation with rat monoclonal anti-HA primary antibody) revealed that the WT V2R was readily detected on the cell surface (Fig. 1A), although it also could be visualized at intracellular sites when cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (Fig. 1E). This intracellular as well as surface expression of the WT V2R in COS M6 cells is probably a result of the considerable overexpression of the V2R in these cells, rendering receptor processing rate-limiting, as described previously (12Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In contrast, immunostaining of intact cells expressing the selected V2R mutants L292P V2R, ΔV278 V2R, and R337X V2R (Fig. 1, B–D, respectively) demonstrated no cell surface immunoreactivity (i.e. no immunofluorescence above control cells not expressing epitope-tagged V2R when primary antibody was incubated with cells in the absence of Triton X-100). These three mutant receptors are expressed, however, since they are immediately detectable when the rat anti-HA antibody is introduced in the presence of 0.2% Triton X-100, revealing that each of these V2R mutants is synthesized but is retained intracellularly (Fig. 1, compare F–H with B–D). Mutant receptor expression also was verified by Western analysis (cf. “Experimental Procedures”). Localization—To determine whether the intracellularly trapped V2R mutants could be rescued to the cell surface, where their functionality could be assessed, cells expressing mutant V2R were incubated with either chemical or pharmacological chaperones or grown at reduced (28 °C) temperature. Subjecting cells to 10% glycerol, a so-called “chemical chaperone” that can rescue some intracellularly trapped proteins (presumably by protein stabilization (13Zhou Z. Gong Q. January C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31123-31126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar)), had no effect on the redistribution of mutant V2Rs nor on the WT V2R (Fig. 2, compare E–H with A–D). The lack of surface expression in glycerol-treated cells was not due to differences in protein expression level, since each of the V2R mutants was synthesized but was trapped intracellularly when examined in permeabilized cells (data not shown). In contrast, treatment with the membrane-permeant V2R antagonist SR121463B dramatically increased detectable V2R expression at the surface for all mutant structures examined (Fig. 2, J–L). It had been previously demonstrated that application of SR121463B increased cell surface expression of other selected V2R mutants, presumably due to promotion or stabilization of properly folded receptors during their maturation in intracellular compartments (14Morello J. Bouvier M. Petaja-Repo U.E. Bichet D.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 466-469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 15Morello J.P. Salahpour A. Laperriere A. Bernier V. Arthus M.F. Lonergan M. Petaja-Repo U. Angers S. Morin D. Bichet D.G. Bouvier M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Moreover, subjecting COS M6 cells to reduced temperature during culture enhanced cell surface localization of the V2R mutants to an extent comparable with pharmacological rescue (Fig. 2, N–P), suggesting that 28 °C is permissive for appropriate folding and trafficking events for these structures in COS M6 cells. We utilized cell surface biotinylation strategies in COS M6 cells to provide quantitative information regarding the delivery of mutant V2R to the surface following rescue with temperature or SR121463B, using WT V2R as a comparator, as shown in Fig. 3. For these calculations, we defined the amount of WT V2R on the surface as 100%; in our studies, we observed that 38% of the total WT V2R expressed in COS M6 cells was on the surface in the absence of SR121463B. SR121463B treatment leads to rescue of the L292P V2R from 8.0 to 38.2% of WT V2R surface expression; the R337X V2R from 22.0 to 88.9% of WT V2R surface expression; and the ΔV278 V2R from 5.3 to 21.2% of WT V2R surface expression (Fig. 3). Interestingly, of the receptor expressed at the surface following exposure to SR121463B, virtually all of the WT V2R, R337X V2R, and ΔV278 V2R was in the mature glycosylated form, whereas none of the L292P V2R was detected in the mature glycosylated form (data not shown). For V2R expressed in COS M6 cells and exposed to 28 °C culture, quantitatively less mutant V2R was expressed at the cell surface overall. Furthermore, in contrast to findings for rescue by SR121463B, only ∼50% of the R337X and ΔV278 V2R that reaches the cell surface achieves the mature glycosylated form; none of the L292P V2R achieves the mature glycosylated form. These data suggest that occupancy of the R337X and ΔV278 V2R by SR121463B stabilizes a single or limited set of V2R conformations that successfully achieve mature glycosylation, whereas incubation of cells at 28 °C does not. In neither circumstance is L292P co"
https://openalex.org/W2107838994,"A peptide contained in the venom of the predatory marine snail Conus tulipa, ρ-TIA, has previously been shown to possess α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist activity. Here, we further characterize its pharmacological activity as well as its structure-activity relationships. In the isolated rat vas deferens, ρ-TIA inhibited α1-adrenoreceptor-mediated increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration that were triggered by norepinephrine, but did not affect presynaptic α2-adrenoreceptor-mediated responses. In radioligand binding assays using [125I]HEAT, ρ-TIA displayed slightly greater potency at the α1B than at the α1A or α1D subtypes. Moreover, although it did not affect the rate of association for [3H]prazosin binding to the α1B-adrenoreceptor, the dissociation rate was increased, indicating non-competitive antagonism by ρ-TIA. N-terminally truncated analogs of ρ-TIA were less active than the full-length peptide, with a large decline in activity observed upon removal of the fourth residue of ρ-TIA (Arg4). An alanine walk of ρ-TIA confirmed the importance of Arg4 for activity and revealed a number of other residues clustered around Arg4 that contribute to the potency of ρ-TIA. The unique allosteric antagonism of ρ-TIA resulting from its interaction with receptor residues that constitute a binding site that is distinct from that of the classical competitive α1-adrenoreceptor antagonists may allow the development of inhibitors that are highly subtype selective.

Shepperson N.B. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1982; 4: S8-S13Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Norepinephrine release modulates vascular tone and, as such, α1-adrenoreceptors are critically involved in circulatory homeostasis. Several α1-adrenoreceptor antagonists, such as the quinazoline derivative, prazosin, are widely used for the treatment of hypertension. α1-Adrenoreceptor antagonists are also used to treat bladder outlet obstruction in benign prostatic hyperplasia (for review, see Ref. 2Tammela T. Drugs Aging. 1997; 10: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) because of their ability to relax smooth muscle. Nevertheless, the α1-adrenoreceptor ligands developed to date interact largely with residues of the transmembrane segments that are homologous between the various receptor subtypes, rather than with residues forming the framework regions (the intra- and extracellular loops). It is not surprising, therefore, that available agonists, and also antagonists, show limited subtype selectivity (affinities differing by 50-fold or less between the various subtypes). For this reason, we sought to identify novel ligands that are likely to interact allosterically and, thus, more likely with the framework residues that are distinct between the three α1-adrenoreceptor subtypes (α1A, α1B, and α1D). The venoms of cone snails (marine gastropods of the genus Conus) contain bioactive peptides that disrupt neurotransmission. These compounds are referred to generically as “conopeptides” or “conotoxins.” Individual conopeptides typically act with a high degree of specificity, yet collectively these toxin peptides possess an extraordinarily diverse spectrum of pharmacological activities. This has made cone snail venoms an attractive resource for the discovery of novel pharmacological agents for use as therapeutics or as research tools. Classes of conopeptides that target voltage-sensitive Ca2+ (the ω-conopeptides), Na+ (μ-, μO-, and δ-conopeptides), and K+ (κ- and κA-conopeptides) channels, and nicotinic acetylcholine (α-, αA-, and ψ-conopeptides), 5-HT3 (σ-conopeptides), N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (conantokins), vasopressin (conopressins), and neurotensin (contulakins) receptors have been identified (for review, see Ref. 3Olivera B.M. Cruz L.J. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Two further classes of conopeptides that target the norepinephrine transporter (χ-conopeptides) and the α1-adrenoreceptor (ρ-conopeptides) have recently been reported by us (4Sharpe I.A. Gehrmann J. Loughnan M.L. Thomas L. Adams D.A. Atkins A. Palant E. Craik D.J. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Nature Neurosci. 2001; 4: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The prototypical member of the ρ-conopeptide class is ρ-TIA, which acts as an α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist. This action at the receptor contrasts with other conopeptides presently known to target G protein-coupled receptors, which act as agonists. The endogenous ligands of these receptors are peptides, and, not surprisingly, these conopeptides possess amino acid sequences that display high homologies with them. Here, we investigated the mode of action of ρ-TIA, its selectivity for α1-adrenoreceptor subtypes, and its structure-activity relationships. ρ-TIA is a nineteen amino acid peptide, with four cysteine residues and an amidated C terminus. The spacing of the cysteine residues is such that there are two intercysteine regions (i.e. in the conformation CC—-C—-C), and two intramolecular disulfide bonds connect the first and third and the second and fourth cysteine residues, respectively. Structurally, ρ-TIA closely resembles members of the α-conopeptide class. The similarity, however, does not extend to their pharmacological activity. The α-conopeptides act as competitive antagonists of muscle and neuronal nicotinic ACh receptors. The most obvious difference between the sequences of ρ-TIA and the α-conopeptides is at the N termini in the region outside of the cysteine-bracketed loops. The majority of α-conopeptides have only a single N-terminal residue preceding the first cysteine residue. A few other α-conopeptides have been found with zero, two, or three leading residues (5Martinez J.S. Olivera B.M. Gray W.R. Craig A.G. Groebe D.R. Abramson S.N. McIntosh J.M.

Suspecting that this region may play an important role in conferring α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist activity on ρ-TIA, we examined the effect of the sequential removal of the first four amino acid residues of ρ-TIA on the activity of the peptide. Further information on the structure-activity relationship of ρ-TIA was provided by examining the effect of systematically substituting each non-cysteine residue with alanine. Peptide Synthesis—C-terminal amidated ρ-TIA and truncated analogs equivalent to residues 2–19, 3–19, 4–19, 5–19, and 1–5 of ρ-TIA were manually synthesized using t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry and cleaved from the resin following procedures described previously (9Nielsen K.J.

Dinitrophenyl group removal from the histidine residue was accomplished off resin. The reduced peptides (50 mg), dissolved in a 10-ml solution of 6 m guanidine HCl, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.2, containing diisopropylethylamine (1 ml) and β-mercaptoethanol (2 ml), were stirred overnight at 18 °C. The mixture was then acidified to pH 3 with trifluoroacetic acid and purified by preparative HPLC. 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high-performance liquid chromatography; NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance; HBTU, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-O-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)uranium hexafluorophosphate); EDT, ethanedithiol; [125I]HEAT, [125I]-2-[β-(3-iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethylaminomethyl tetralone; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid, Type A. The pure reduced peptides were oxidized in 0.33 m NH4OAc, 0.5 m guanidine HCl, pH 7.8, in the presence of reduced and oxidized glutathione as previously described (9Nielsen K.J. Adams D. Thomas L. Bond T. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The adoption of the Cys1–Cys3, Cys2–Cys4 pattern of disulfide connectivity by ρ-TIA and the truncated analogs was verified by NMR techniques. Analogs of ρ-TIA in which single residues were replaced with alanine were synthesized using Fmoc chemistry. The chain assembly of the peptides was performed on a manual shaker system using HBTU activation protocols (10Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar) to couple the Fmoc-protected amino acid to the resin. The Fmoc protecting group was removed using 50% piperidine in dimethylformamide, and dimethylformamide was used as both the coupling solvent and for flow washes throughout the cycle. The progress of the assembly was monitored by quantitative ninhydrin monitoring (11Sarin V.K. Kent S.B. Tam J.P. Merrifield R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Peptide was deprotected and cleaved from the resin by stirring at room temperature in trifluoroacetic acid/H2O/triisopropyl silane/EDT (90:5:2.5:2.5) for 2–3 h. Cold diethyl ether was then added to the mixture and the peptide precipitated out. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and subsequently washed with further cold diethyl ether to remove scavengers. The final product was dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile and lyophilized to yield a fluffy white solid. The crude, reduced peptide was examined by reverse phase HPLC for purity, and the correct molecular weight confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Pure, reduced peptides were oxidized, and the major peak was purified to >95% purity and characterized by HPLC prior to further use.Table IAmino acid sequence of ρ-TIA and N-terminal truncated analogsPeptideAmino acid sequenceConnectivityρ-TIAFNWRCCLIPACRRNHKKFC*1-3, 2-4TIA2-19NWRCCLIPACRRNHKKFC*1-3, 2-4TIA3-19WRCCLIPACRRNHKKFC*1-3, 2-4TIA4-19RCCLIPACRRNHKKFC*1-3, 2-4TIA5-19CCLIPACRRNHKKFC*1-3, 2-4TIA1-5FNWRC*none Open table in a new tab Isolated Rat Vas Deferens—Vasa deferentia were excised from male Wistar rats (250–350 g) killed by a blow to the head, and exsanguinated. Epididymal and prostatic portions were bisected transversely and mounted in 5 ml organ baths under a resting tension of 0.5 g in physiological salt solution containing (mm): NaCl, 119; KCl, 4.7; MgSO4, 1.17; KH2PO4, 1.18; NaHCO3, 25.0; d-(+)-glucose, 5.5; CaCl2, 2.5; EDTA, 0.026; maintained at 37 °C, and bubbled with 5% CO2/95% O2. Longitudinal tension was measured using isometric force transducers and recorded digitally (MacLab/8s data acquisition system; ADInstruments, Sydney, Australia). In the first set of experiments, a cumulative concentration-response curve for the contraction of the epididymal vas deferens elicited by exogenously applied norepinephrine was established. The preparations were then washed several times with drug-free solution. After 15 min, a dose of ρ-TIA was added to the organ bath and equilibrated with the tissues for 20 min before a second concentration-response curve to norepinephrine was generated. In other experiments, ρ-TIA was assayed for α2-adrenoreceptor antagonist activity. Prostatic tissue segments were field stimulated with a single electrical pulse of 55 V amplitude and 1 ms duration generated by a Grass S44 stimulator (Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA) at 20 s intervals. Prazosin was added to the baths to a final concentration of 0.5 μm to block α1-adrenoreceptors, and equilibrated with the tissues for 20 min before doses of norepinephrine were added in half-log unit steps to establish cumulative concentration-response curves. Each dose of norepinephrine was added after the effect of the previous dose had reached its maximum. The tissues were then washed with drug-free solution several times and allowed to recover for ∼30 min. At this time, the prazosin (0.5 μm) was replaced and 10 μm ρ-TIA was added. After 20 min, a second concentration-response curve to norepinephrine was generated. In the final set of experiments, the N-terminal truncated analogs of ρ-TIA listed in Table I were assayed for α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist activity. The bisected prostatic vas deferens segments were stimulated as before, but at 3 min intervals. ρ-TIA or one of its truncated analogs was added to the organ bath to a final concentration of 10 μm, and the peptide's effect on the tissue's contractile response was assessed. Isolation of Smooth Muscle Cells—Vasa deferentia were excised from 10–14-day-old and ≥ 6-week-old Wistar rats killed by exposure to halothane. Adventitia and blood vessels were removed using a pair of fine forceps. The vasa deferentia were halved and incubated at room temperature in fresh Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) for 5 min. Portions of vas deferens were placed in 2 ml Ca2+-free HBSS containing 2 mg/ml collagenase (type B, Roche Applied Science) and bubbled with 95% O2, 5% CO2 for 1 h at 30 °C. The tissue pieces were then cut into smaller fragments and further incubated in fresh enzyme-containing solution in three 10 min stages. The vas deferens fragments were slightly agitated to enhance cellular dissociation. At the end of each stage, cells in the supernatant were collected and placed in fresh solution. Bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) was added, and the cell suspension was kept at 4 °C for 2 h. Cells were then plated on 25 mm round glass cover-slips in Petri dishes containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and used within 48–72 h. Fura-2 Fluorometric Measurements—Cover-slips holding cells were mounted in a recording chamber and constantly perfused with bath solution containing (mm): NaCl, 150; KCl, 5.4; HEPES, 10; d-glucose, 10; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; pH 7.4, at a rate of 2 ml/min. The loading procedure was similar to that described by Liu et al. (12Liu D.M. Katnik C. Stafford M. Adams D.J. J. Physiol. 2000; 526: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 1 h in bath solution containing 5 μm Fura-2, AM, and 0.02% Pluronic-127 detergent. After loading, the cells were incubated for a further 30 min in fresh bathing solution to allow de-esterification. Fluorescent signals were acquired using a Photon Technology International photomultiplier detection system driven by the Felix software package, and free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated from the ratio of emissions at 510 nm following excitement with wavelengths of 340 nm and 380 nm as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (13Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fluorescent responses elicited by the application of norepinephrine or ATP (both 10 μm) in the absence and presence of ρ-TIA were monitored. The experiments were carried out at room temperature (23 °C). Membrane Preparation and DNA Constructs—COS-1 cells (ATCC; Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, and 5% fetal bovine serum. At 60–80% confluency, the cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA incorporating α1-adrenoreceptor cDNA in the modified eukaryotic expression vector pMT2′ using the DEAE-dextran method (14Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar), as previously described (15Chen S. Lin F. Xu M. Hwa J. Graham R.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4265-4271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, COS-7 cells (ECACC; Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK) were used. These were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transiently transfected with the α1-adrenoreceptor using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Three different plasmid constructs were used: one for the rat α1A-adrenoreceptor subtype (16Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Malik N. Gaivin R. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 823-831PubMed Google Scholar), one for the hamster α1B-adrenoreceptor (17Hwa J. Graham R.M. Perez D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23189-23195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and another for the rat α1D-adrenoreceptor (18Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared 24 h post-transfection as described previously (18Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar), and resuspended in HEM buffer (20 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm EGTA, 12.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) containing 10% v/v glycerol and stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration of the prepared membranes was determined by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Radioligand Binding Assays—To determine the α1-adrenoreceptor subtype selectivity of ρ-TIA, the effect of ρ-TIA on the binding of the radiolabelled α1-adrenoreceptor antagonist [125I]HEAT was examined. Reactions containing [125I]HEAT (70 pm), membranes from α1-adrenoreceptor-transfected COS-1 cells (1 μg protein), HEM buffer, and increasing concentrations of ρ-TIA were set up in polypropylene tubes and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The assays were performed in duplicate in a total reaction volume of 250 μl. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm phentolamine. Reactions were stopped by the addition of ice-cold HEM buffer, and the tubes' contents were filtered under vacuum onto Whatman GF/C glass filters with a Brandel cell harvester. The filters were washed 5 times with ice-cold HEM buffer, and the amount of filter-bound radioactivity was determined using a Packard Auto-γ 500 counter. In other binding experiments, [3H]prazosin was used as the radioligand. To examine the effect of ρ-TIA on the rate of association of [3H]prazosin to the α1B-adrenoreceptor, reactions containing [3H]prazosin (0.25 nm), membranes from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the α1B-adrenoreceptor (2.5 μg protein), HEM buffer were set up in duplicate in the absence and presence of ρ-TIA (17.5 nm). The amount of nonspecific binding was determined as described above. Binding was allowed to proceed for 0–90 min. The effect of ρ-TIA on the rate of dissociation of [3H] prazosin from the α1B-adrenoreceptor was investigated in assays where phentolamine (100 μm) with and without ρ-TIA (10 μm) was added to reactions containing [3H]prazosin (0.43 nm) and α1B-adrenoreceptor membranes (7 μg protein) that had previously been incubated for 60 min. In experiments with alanine-substituted analogs of ρ-TIA, [3H]prazosin (0.43 nm) and α1B-adrenoreceptor membranes (7 μg protein) were incubated for 60 min with increasing concentrations of peptide (10–11–10–5m). The reaction volume was 150 μl. Membranes were harvested onto Whatman GF/B filtermats using a Tomtec harvester. BetaPlate scintillant (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was applied and the filter-bound radioactivity detected using a Wallac MicroBeta counter. Statistics and Data Analysis—Curves were fitted to the individual data points of sets of 3–6 separate experiments by non-linear regression using Prism 3 software for Macintosh (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Student's t test was used to compare the curve-fitting parameters between treatments, and analysis of variance with post hoc t tests performed by the Tukey method was used for multiple comparisons. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant.

Collagenase type B and 1,4-dithiothreitol were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Fura-2, AM, and Pluronic-127 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). [125I]HEAT (specific activity, 2200 Ci/mmol) and [7-methoxy-3H]prazosin (specific activity, 87 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protected Fmoc-amino acid derivatives were from Novabiochem or Auspep (Melbourne, Australia).

HPLC grade acetonitrile and methanol was supplied by Sigma. Resin used was Fmoc-rink amide resin supplied by Polymer Labs. Triisopropyl silane was from Aldrich Chemicals. α 1-Adrenoreceptor Antagonism—The application of norepinephrine (1 μm) to dissociated smooth muscle cells from the vasa deferentia of adult rats elicited an increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i) from 19 ± 3.3 nm to 130 ± 26 nm (n = 9). In cells from juvenile rats, the same concentration of norepinephrine raised the Ca2+ concentration from 32 ± 7.6 nm to 309 ± 46 nm (n = 4). The magnitude of the elicited responses, but not the resting Ca2+ levels, were significantly different between adult and juvenile rats. In both age groups, the responses could be abolished by prazosin (10 nm), indicating that they were mediated by α1-adrenoreceptors. ρ-TIA inhibited the Ca2+ responses of adult cells with an IC50 of 133 nm (pIC50 = 6.88 ± 0.05) and juvenile cells with an IC50 of 470 nm (pIC50 = 6.33 ± 0.03) (Fig. 1). Neither curve's bottom was significantly different from zero, indicating that ρ-TIA acts as a full inhibitor. The juvenile concentration-response curve was significantly steeper than the adult curve, with a Hill slope parameter of –2.6 ± 0.4 compared with –0.89 ± 0.10. ρ-TIA (1 μm) had no effect on the Ca2+ response of the isolated smooth muscle cells that was evoked by 10 μm ATP (n = 3; data not shown). α 1-Adrenoreceptor But Not α 2-Adrenoreceptor Antagonism— The effect of various concentrations of ρ-TIA on the α1-adrenoreceptor-mediated contractile responses of isolated segments of rat vas deferens to exogenously applied norepinephrine is shown in Fig. 2A. In the absence of ρ-TIA, the EC50 of norepinephrine was determined to be 9.3 μm (pEC50 = 5.0 ± 0.03). This value was increased to 32 μm (pEC50 = 4.5 ± 0.07), 51 μm (pEC50 = 4.3 ± 0.09), and to 166 μm (pEC50 = 3.3 ± 0.08) in the presence of 1, 3, and 10 μm ρ-TIA, respectively. The maximum response of the tissue to norepinephrine was 99 ± 4.4% of the control response when 1 μm ρ-TIA was present and 82 ± 4.9% and 42 ± 3.4% in the presence of 3 and 10 μm ρ-TIA, respectively. The decline in the maximum response following treatment with the two highest concentrations of ρ-TIA was significant (p < 0.001). The bisected rat prostatic vas deferens responded to electrical field stimulation with a biphasic contraction, reflecting the distinct time courses for the postsynaptic actions of the sympathetic co-transmitters ATP and norepinephrine in the tissue (20Sneddon P. Westfall D.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 347: 561-580Crossref Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Following the addition of prazosin, the previously biphasic response consisted of only the first component. This prazosin-resistant component could be abolished by activating α2-adrenoreceptors with exogenously applied norepinephrine. The IC50 for the inhibition by norepinephrine was 1.1 μm (pIC50 = 6.0 ± 0.10) (Fig. 2B). In the presence of ρ-TIA (10 μm), the IC50 was not significantly different (pIC50 = 5.9 ± 0.13). Neither norepinephrine nor ρ-TIA had a direct effect on the resting tension of the preparation. α 1-Adrenoreceptor Subtype Selectivity and Effect on [3H]prazosin Binding Kinetics—ρ-TIA inhibited the binding of [125I]HEAT to all three cloned α1-adrenoreceptor subtypes (Fig. 3). The IC50 values for ρ-TIA were 150 nm (pIC50 = 6.8 ± 0.04) at the α1A-adrenoreceptor; 70 nm (pIC50 = 7.15 ± 0.06) at the α1B-adrenoreceptor; and 340 nm (pIC50 = 6.5 ± 0.05) at the α1D-adrenoreceptor. The difference in the potency of ρ-TIA between α1-adrenoreceptor subtypes was significant for all sets of comparisons (p < 0.001). The Hill slope parameters for the effect of ρ-TIA were not significantly different from unity. The effect of ρ-TIA on the association rate of [3H]prazosin binding to α1B-adrenoreceptors is shown in Fig. 4A. In the absence of ρ-TIA, the observed rate constant for the association of [3H]prazosin (k ob) was determined to be 0.101 ± 0.008 min–1. The k ob in experiments with ρ-TIA present was 0.119 ± 0.013 min–1, which is not significantly different from the control value. The total specific binding was reduced from 2.50 ± 0.052 pmol/mg protein to 1.52 ± 0.041 pmol/mg protein in the presence of ρ-TIA (17.5 nm). The difference in the amount of total specific binding achieved in the absence and presence of ρ-TIA was highly significant (p < 0.001). The dissociation of [3H]prazosin from the α1B-adrenoreceptors (Fig. 4B) proceeded at a rate of 0.50 ± 0.03 h–1 in control experiments. In the presence of ρ-TIA (10 μm), the dissociation rate constant (k off) was increased significantly to 1.15 ± 0.06 h–1 (p < 0.001). Truncated Analogs of ρ-TIA—All of the N-terminal truncated analogs of ρ-TIA (see Table I) tested were active in the vas deferens assay, causing selective inhibition of the second component of the biphasic contraction as observed for ρ-TIA. However, the N-terminal tail alone, TIA1–5, had no effect on either phase of the contraction at a concentration of 10 μm. The deletion of N-terminal residues from ρ-TIA was associated with a loss in activity, demonstrated by the relative extent of the second component that remained after treatment with the analogs and full-length ρ-TIA (all 10 μm; Fig. 5). Alanine Walk of ρ-TIA—The potencies of ρ-TIA and its alanine-substituted analogs at the α1B-adrenoreceptor are compared in Fig. 6. All of the peptides acted as full inhibitors of specific [3H]prazosin binding and none of the Hill slope parameters of the concentration-response curves were significantly different from unity. The potency of ρ-TIA was the same whether the binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 60 or 120 min (data not shown). Of the fourteen analogs tested, six were found to be significantly less potent than ρ-TIA. The greatest loss of potency was seen upon replacement of the arginine residue at position 4, which resulted in a reduction in potency of ∼270-fold compared with the native conopeptide. As a peptide, ρ-TIA is structurally unique among the α1-adrenoreceptor antagonists described to date, some of which were also originally isolated from natural sources (e.g. the plant alkaloids corynanthine, dicentrine, and dehydroevodiamine). We have explored the pharmacology of ρ-TIA in functional and binding assays, and found that the uniqueness of ρ-TIA compared with other α1-adrenoreceptor antagonists also extends to its mechanism of action. Functional α1-adrenoreceptor antagonism by ρ-TIA was demonstrated at both the tissue and cellular level through its ability to inhibit the norepinephrine-evoked increases in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and contractility. The vast majority of known α1-adrenoreceptor antagonists act competitively with respect to norepinephrine. ρ-TIA, however, behaves as a non-competitive antagonist. This was indicated in these experiments by the effect of the peptide to inhibit the maximum level of the α1-adrenoreceptor-mediated contractile response proving to be incapable of being surmounted by increasing the concentration of applied norepinephrine. Changes in various aspects of α1-adrenergic neurotransmission associated with age have been reported (21MacDonald A. McGrath J.C. Br. J.

https://openalex.org/W2061619281,"Classic Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) tissue contains a small population of morphologically distinct malignant cells called Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, associated with the development of HL. Using 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) we identified an alternative mRNA for the DEC-205 multilectin receptor in the HRS cell line L428. Sequence analysis revealed that the mRNA encodes a fusion protein between DEC-205 and a novel C-type lectin DCL-1. Although the 7.5-kb DEC-205 and 4.2-kb DCL-1 mRNA were expressed independently in myeloid and B lymphoid cell lines, the DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion mRNA (9.5 kb) predominated in the HRS cell lines (L428, KM-H2, and HDLM-2). The DEC-205 and DCL-1 genes comprising 35 and 6 exons, respectively, are juxtaposed on chromosome band 2q24 and separated by only 5.4 kb. We determined the DCL-1 transcription initiation site within the intervening sequence by 5′-RACE, confirming that DCL-1 is an independent gene. Two DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion mRNA variants may result from cotranscription of DEC-205 and DCL-1, followed by splicing DEC-205 exon 35 or 34–35 along with DCL-1 exon 1. The resulting reading frames encode the DEC-205 ectodomain plus the DCL-1 ectodomain, the transmembrane, and the cytoplasmic domain. Using DCL-1 cytoplasmic domain-specific polyclonal and DEC-205 monoclonal antibodies for immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis, we showed that the fusion mRNA is translated into a DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion protein, expressed in the HRS cell lines. These results imply an unusual transcriptional control mechanism in HRS cells, which cotranscribe an mRNA containing DEC-205 and DCL-1 prior to generating the intergenically spliced mRNA to produce a DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion protein.

Two DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion mRNA variants may result from cotranscription of DEC-205 and DCL-1, followed by splicing DEC-205 exon 35 or 34–35 along with DCL-1 exon 1. The resulting reading frames encode the DEC-205 ectodomain plus the DCL-1 ectodomain, the transmembrane, and the cytoplasmic domain. Using DCL-1 cytoplasmic domain-specific polyclonal and DEC-205 monoclonal antibodies for immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis, we showed that the fusion mRNA is translated into a DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion protein, expressed in the HRS cell lines. These results imply an unusual transcriptional control mechanism in HRS cells, which cotranscribe an mRNA containing DEC-205 and DCL-1 prior to generating the intergenically spliced mRNA to produce a DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion protein. Classic Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) 1The abbreviations used are: HL, Hodgkin's lymphoma; HRS, Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg; APC, antigen-presenting cell; DC, dendritic cell; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcriptase; CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain; TM, transmembrane domain; CP, cytoplasmic domain; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MMR, macrophage mannose receptor; PLA2R, phospholipase A2 receptor; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SP, signal peptide. is a common malignant lymphoma characterized by the presence of a small population (<1%) of putative malignant cells, the morphologically distinct Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells. Recent advances in cell isolation techniques and molecular biology has identified Ig gene rearrangements within the majority of individual HRS cells, suggesting their B cell origin (1Marafioti T.

These are surrounded by a large population of apparently non-malignant lymphocytes and histiocytes, whose proliferation is likely to be mediated by the wide range of cytokines and chemokines released by the HRS cells (reviewed in Refs. 2Skinnider B.F.

HRS cells have many characteristics in common with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as activated B cells and dendritic cells (DCs) (4Sorg U.R. Morse T.M. Patton W.N. Hock B.D. Angus H.B.

Indeed, the HRS cell lines (L428, HDLM-2, and/or KM-H2) express cell surface molecules required for costimulation/proliferation of T cells (major histocompatibility complex class II, CD40, CD80, and CD86) (5Delabie J.

L428 cells have been used successfully in our laboratory to produce monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against DC differentiation antigens such as CMRF-44 (15Hock B.D. Starling G.C. Daniel P.B. Hart D.N. Immunology. 1994; 83: 573-581PubMed Google Scholar) and CMRF-56 (16Hock B.D. Fearnley D.B. Boyce A. McLellan A.D. Sorg R.V. Summers K.L. Hart D.N.

We have investigated cell surface molecules on HRS cell lines with a view to identifying novel molecules related to APC function. These molecules might also be candidate targets for antibody-based HL immunotherapy. Indeed, CD20, CD25, and CD30 reagents (markers for B cells and activated lymphocytes) have been investigated in this regard (19Falini B. Pileri S. Pizzolo G. Durkop H. Flenghi L. Stirpe F.

Lymphoma. 1999; 35: 641-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but molecules more restricted to HRS cells might be preferred as targets for more specific therapeutics. During the cloning of DEC-205 from the L428 cell line by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (17Kato M. Neil T.K. Clark G.J. Morris C.M. Sorg R.V. Hart D.N. Immunogenetics. 1998; 47: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we discovered an alternatively spliced novel DEC-205 mRNA. This mRNA encodes the intact DEC-205 ectodomain but included unique sequences encoding for an additional carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and a transmembrane (TM) and a cytoplasmic (CP) domain derived from a newly identified type I transmembrane C-type lectin DCL-1. A partial cDNA sequence (KIAA0022) of DCL-1 was identified by random sequencing of a KG-1 cDNA library (22Nomura N. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Kawarabayasi Y. Sato S. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the characterization of the DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion mRNA and protein. Its apparently selective expression in HRS cells may make it a useful target for both antibody- and T cell-mediated immunotherapy. Cell Lines—The human hematopoietic cell lines, HEL, KG-1, K562, THP-1, U937, Mann, Daudi, Raji, WT49, Mann, Molt-4, Jurkat, HL-60, and HSB-2 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). L428 cells were provided by V. Diehl (Klinik fur Innere Medizin, Cologne, Germany) (23Schaadt M. Diehl V. Stein H. Fonatsch C. Kirchner H.H. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 26: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). HDLM-2 (24Diehl V. Pfreundschuh M. Fonatsch C. Stein H. Falk M. Burrichter H. Schaadt M.

Blood. 1986; 68: 285-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganism and Cell Culture (Braunschweig, Germany). Mono Mac 6 cells (26Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Thiel E. Futterer A. Herzog V. Wirtz A. Riethmuller G. Int. J. Cancer. 1988; 41: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) were provided by E. M. Schneider (Dusseldorf, Germany). All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia), 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, except for HDLM-2 cells, which were maintained in 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum. These cells were subjected to RNA preparation using TRIzol (Invitrogen) for RT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. Antibodies and Other Reagents—The mAb MMRI-7 against human DEC-205 was produced in our laboratory (27Kato M. MacDonald K. Munster D. Clark G. Hart D.N.J. Mason D. Leucocyte Typing VII. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002: 298-300Google Scholar). MMRI-7 binds to an epitope within DEC-205 CRDs 1 and 2. The other anti-human DEC-205 mAb, M335, was provided by R. J. Armitage (Immunex, Seattle, WA) through the 7th International Workshop on Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens. M335 binds to an epitope within DEC-205 cysteine-rich domain (27Kato M. MacDonald K. Munster D. Clark G. Hart D.N.J. Mason D. Leucocyte Typing VII. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002: 298-300Google Scholar). Goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Dako (Botany, New South Wales, NSW, Australia). Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG-Fc-specific and protein A-conjugated agarose beads were from Sigma (Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). HRP-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG was from Silenus (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). ELISA plates (Maxsorb) were from Nalge Nunc International (Rochester, NY). Prestained protein standards (Benchmark Prestained Protein Ladder) and DNA ladder (1-kb ladder) were from Invitrogen. Molecular biological enzymes (e.g. restriction enzymes, polymerases, and ligase) were obtained from Invitrogen, Promega (Sydney, NSW, Australia) or Roche Applied Science (Castle Hill, NSW, Australia). Unless specified, general chemicals were obtained from Sigma or BDH (Poole, England). Rabbit polyclonal peptide antisera against the DEC-205 CP domain and the DCL-1 CP were produced by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with diphtheria toxoid-conjugated synthetic peptide CEDEIMLPSFHD and CGEENEYPYQFD (Minotopes, Clayton, Victoria, Australia), respectively, using a conventional schedule with Freund adjuvant at the Herston Medical Research Institute (Herston, Queensland, Australia). To assess the titer of the antibodies against CP peptides, an ELISA plate was coated with streptavidin (Sigma) and biotinylated peptides for DEC-205 CP (biotin-SGSGEDEIMLPSFHD) and DCL-1 CP (biotin-SGSGEENEYPYQFD) captured. The plate was blocked with 1% (w/v) sodium caseinate (Sigma) in PBS and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 20 (PBS/Tween) and incubated with serially diluted antisera. After washing the plate with PBS/Tween, bound antibody was detected with HRP-sheep anti-rabbit IgG and o-phenylenediamine hydrochloride and quantitated with 492 nm using an ELISA reader. There was no cross-reactivity detected between these two rabbit CP antibodies at the dilutions used in the experiments described (data not shown). 3′-Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends—The 3′-end of DEC-205 mRNA was obtained by 3′-RACE, which was performed as described previously (17Kato M. Neil T.K. Clark G.J. Morris C.M. Sorg R.V. Hart D.N. Immunogenetics. 1998; 47: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, L428 mRNA was reverse-transcribed with an oligo(dT) adaptor primer. The obtained L428 cDNA pool was subjected to PCR using a DEC-205-specific forward primer and an adaptor primer and cloned into pBluescript SKII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The clones were analyzed by restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing using a BigDye Terminator kit on an ABI Prism 377 automated sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Scoresby, Victoria, Australia) by Australian Genome Research Facility (University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia). RT-PCR Analysis—PCR was performed on the L428 cDNA pool using DEC-205-specific forward primers (078, 088, 090, 092, and 094, nested within various parts of the DEC-205 ectodomain) in combination with either DEC-205-specific reverse primer (085, nested within DEC-205 CP) or DCL-1-specific reverse primer (086, nested within DCL-1 ectodomain) with an Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Applied Science) (Table I). The PCR reactions were fractionated in 0.8% (w/v) agarose in Tris acetate buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) and visualized with ethidium bromide. The PCR products obtained by the primer combination 078/085 and 078/086 were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced.Table IThe DNA sequences of oligonucleotides primers used in this studyPrimerSequence (5′→3′)Accession numberPosition (orientation)061CATCTGGGCCTTTCCATTGCTAY314007286-306 (reverse)062GACCATGGAGCGGACATGATAAY314007216-236 (forward)063GGCTCTACCATCTGGGTTTGTAY3140071811-1831 (forward)078GAAATGGTTGACTACAAAGAAGAAF0113334200-4222 (forward)085ACCAAATCAGTCCGCCCATGAGAAAF0113335095-5118 (reverse)086ATCATGTCCGCTCCATGGTCAGTAAY314007212-235 (reverse)088TATTCAGAAGTTAAAAGCAGAAF0113333327-3347 (forward)090CCAAAAGGCCGTACTCCAAAAAF0113332430-2450 (forward)092GGAGGAAAACTGAATGACGCAAF0113331518-1538 (forward)094GAAAACGGTTGTGAAGATAATAF011333690-710 (forward)199GCTCCATGGTCAGTACACTGAAY314007206-226 (reverse) Open table in a new tab Northern Blot Analysis—Approximately 10 μg of total RNA from cultured cell lines was fractionated in formaldehyde-denatured 1% (w/v) agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N+ cationic nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Sydney, NSW, Australia). The 864-bp DEC-205 cDNA probe nested within DEC-205 CRD1 and -2 was PCR-amplified using primers 094 and 095 on the DEC-205 cDNA clone pCRD1/2-Ig (27Kato M. MacDonald K. Munster D. Clark G. Hart D.N.J. Mason D. Leucocyte Typing VII. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002: 298-300Google Scholar) and Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The 1617-bp DCL-1 cDNA probe was PCR-amplified using DCL-1-specific primers 062 and 063 on the pBS30-1 (Fig. 1). These probes were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia) and labeled with [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Biosciences) using a Strip-EZ DNA StipAble DNA probe Synthesis and Removal kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The membrane was hybridized sequentially with these probes and exposed to a Kodak BioMax MS x-ray film at –70 °C using an intensifying screen (Amersham Biosciences). The final wash was 0.1 × SSC (1 × SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) and 0.5% (w/v) SDS at 68 °C. After each probing, the membrane was chemically stripped according to the manufacture's instructions and used for hybridization with the other probes. 5′-RACE—RNA ligase-mediated 5′-RACE was performed using a FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion). Briefly, total RNA from HL-60 was treated sequentially with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase and tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to select and to remove the cap structure of full-length mRNA. The RNA adaptor was ligated to the RNA using T4 RNA ligase, and the RNA was subjected to cDNA synthesis with random decamer or DCL-1-specific primer 061 and Thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNA was subjected to two rounds of PCR using DCL-1-specific primers 086 and 099 in combination with the 5′-RACE outer primer and inner primer (provided by the kit), respectively. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced. Preparation of Cell Lysate—Approximately 107 cells were lysed with 1 ml of 0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) and incubated on ice for 10 min with occasional vortexing. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and used directly for immunoprecipitation/Western blotting or sandwich ELISA analysis described below. Immunoprecipitation/Western Blot Analysis—The cell extract was precleared with a non-immune rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C and subjected to immunoprecipitation using the rabbit peptide antisera against DEC-205 CP or DCL-1 CP with protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed with a wash buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate), and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2% (w/v) SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were subjected to Laemmli discontinuous SDS-PAGE with 10% (v/v) polyacrylamide separating gel (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) in the non-reducing condition and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (PVDF-Plus, Osmonics, Westborough, MA). The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in PBS/Tween (BLOTTO), incubated with a mixture of DEC-205 mAbs (MMRI-7 and M335, 5 μg/ml each) overnight at 4 °C, and washed with PBS/Tween. The membrane was incubated with HRP-anti-goat mouse IgG, and the bound enzyme was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico, Pierce, Rockford, IL) on a Kodak X-Omat XB-1 x-ray film. Sandwich ELISA—An ELISA plate was coated with 10 μg/ml goat anti-mouse IgG in PBS, washed with PBS/Tween, and blocked with BLOTTO. To the plate a mixture of DEC-205 mAb (MMRI-7 and M335, 2 μg/ml each) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plate was washed and incubated with the serially diluted cell extracts overnight at 4 °C. The plate was washed with PBS/Tween and incubated with either rabbit peptide antibodies against DEC-205 CP or DCL-1 CP (1:1000 dilution in PBS/Tween) or non-immune rabbit serum for 1 h at room temperature, and, after washing with PBS/Tween, the plate was incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG in 5% mouse serum and PBS/Tween. The plate was developed with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride and quantitated at 492 nm. Identification of the cDNA Clone Encoding DEC-205/DCL-1 Fusion—To obtain the 3′-end of human DEC-205 mRNA, we performed 3′-RACE (17Kato M. Neil T.K. Clark G.J. Morris C.M. Sorg R.V. Hart D.N. Immunogenetics. 1998; 47: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This resulted in amplification of a PCR product of ∼3 kb (data not shown). When we cloned the PCR product and analyzed several clones by restriction enzyme analysis, however, we realized that there were two distinct sequences within the PCR product. The clone pB30-3 contained the authentic DEC-205 sequence encoding the DEC-205 CRD 8–10, TM, and CP (17Kato M. Neil T.K. Clark G.J. Morris C.M. Sorg R.V. Hart D.N. Immunogenetics. 1998; 47: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The other clone pB30-1, however, encoded DEC-205 CRD 8–10 followed by a unique sequence distinct from the DEC-205 TM and CP sequence (Fig. 1A). The junction of the DEC-205 and unique sequence was located within the connecting region (spacer 11) between the DEC-205 CRD10 and TM. A BLAST search identified the unique sequence as a part of the cDNA, KIAA0022 derived from KG-1 cell cDNA library (22Nomura N. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Kawarabayasi Y. Sato S. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Our further analysis showed that the KIAA0022 contained a partial cDNA encoding a novel type I transmembrane C-type lectin receptor, and we termed it DCL-1 (DEC-205-associated C-type Lectin-1). The complete DCL-1 coding region encodes a signal peptide (SP), one CRD, one TM, and one CP. The KIAA0022 cDNA was recently annotated to a C-type lectin molecule (GenBank™ accession number BAA03498), and its gene was mapped to chromosome band 2q24. More details of DCL-1 will be published elsewhere. 2S. Khan, K. J. McDonald, B. P. O'Neill, N. Gonzalez, B. J. Cooper, D. N. J. Hart, and M. Kato, manuscript in preparation. The sequence analysis of the clone pB30-1 showed that fusion junction occurred within the codon G/GC (“/” indicates the junction) for Gly in the DEC-205 spacer 11, connected to the codon G/AC for Asp in the junction between the DCL-1 SP and CRD. The fusion junction was in-frame, connecting the DEC-205 CRD 10 to the DCL-1 CRD, TM, and CP, suggesting that the DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion mRNA is translated. Furthermore, analysis of the DEC-205 and DCL-1 genes indicated that for this fusion mRNA the junction is formed by splicing DEC-205 exon 35 and DCL-1 exon 1, resulting in the fusion of DEC-205 exon 34 to DCL-1 exon 2 (a variant fusion mRNA termed V34-2, Fig. 1B). An additional variant fusion mRNA termed V33-2 is described below. The DEC-205/DCL-1 Fusion mRNA Appears to Encode the Entire DEC-205 Ectodomain—We examined the L428 cDNA pool containing the DEC-205/DCL-1 junction by RT-PCR to examine whether it included the entire DEC-205 ectodomain (Fig. 2). The combination of the DEC-205 CP-specific reverse primer 085 with DEC-205-specific forward primers, nested to various parts of DEC-205 ectodomain, yielded major PCR products of the sizes predicted in accordance with the primer combinations used. We also detected slightly smaller (by ∼200 bp) minor PCR products, which were most apparent in the primer combinations of 078/085 and 088/085. When the DCL-1-specific reverse primer 086 was used in combination with the same DEC-205-specific forward primers, we detected doublet bands (∼200 bp apart), the larger band of which was the predicted size. Sequence analysis indicated that the smaller RT-PCR fragments from DEC-205 itself or the DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion mRNA were amplified from alternatively spliced RNA, lacking DEC-205 exon 34 (168 bp, described below). Thus, L428 cells express at least two variants of the DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion mRNAs, one with DEC-205 exon 34 fused to DCL-1 exon 2 (a variant termed V34-2) and one with DEC-205 exon 33 fused to DCL-1 exon 2 (a variant termed V33-2) (Fig. 2). Sequence analysis of the fusion junction of V33-2 showed that the junction is in-frame, indicating that V33-2 DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion mRNA is also likely to be translated. The V34-2 encodes the entire DEC-205 ectodomain fused to DCL-1 CRD, TM, and CP. The V33-2 lacks approximately one-third of the C-terminal portion of DEC-205 CRD 10, and the rest of DEC-205 ectodomain is fused to DCL-1. The DEC-205/DCL-1 Fusion mRNA Is Predominantly Expressed by HRS Cell Lines—To assess DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion mRNA expression, we performed Northern blot analysis in several hematopoietic cell lines (Fig. 3). The DCL-1-specific probe nested within the DCL-1 ectodomain detected a single 4.2-kb DCL-1 mRNA band in myeloid cell lines (HEL, HL60, U937, and Monomac 6), but no bands were detected in the B or T cell lines tested. We detected a single 9.5-kb DEC-205/DCL-1 mRNA band in HRS cell lines (HDLM-2, L428, and KM-H2), however, we did not detect the 4.2-kb DCL-1 mRNA band observed in the myeloid cell lines. The U937 cells appear to express a small amount of the 9.5-kb DEC-205/DCL-1 mRNA in addition to the 4.2-kb DCL-1 mRNA band. When the DEC-205-specific probe nested within the cysteine-rich domain was used to hybridize the same blot after the DCL-1 probe was stripped, a 7.5-kb DEC-205 mRNA band was detected in myeloid cell lines (HEL and U937), B cell lines (Daudi and Mann), and all HRS cell lines. In addition, we detected a 9.5-kb DEC-205/DCL-1 mRNA band in all HRS cell lines and the U937 as described previously (17Kato M. Neil T.K. Clark G.J. Morris C.M. Sorg R.V. Hart D.N. Immunogenetics. 1998; 47: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion mRNA predominates in HRS cell lines. The DEC-205 and DCL-1 Genes Are Juxtaposed in Chromosome Band 2q24 —We mapped the DEC-205 gene (LY75) previously to the chromosome band 2q24 (17Kato M. Neil T.K. Clark G.J. Morris C.M. Sorg R.V.

Kawarabayasi Y. Sato S. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and further mapped recently to the identical chromosomal band in the NCBI UniGene data base. Using the NCBI Genome BLAST, we identified the human genomic contig NT 005151 containing both DEC-205 and the DCL-1 gene. Our sequence analysis showed that DEC-205 and DCL-1 genes consist of 35 and 6 exons, respectively, and the DEC-205 gene is localized ∼5.4 kb upstream of the DCL-1 gene (Fig. 4). The DCL-1 Gene Is Independently Expressed from the DEC-205 Gene—It is possible that the proposed DCL-1 gene is a part of DEC-205 gene and that the DCL-1 mRNA is generated by alternative splicing of DEC-205 mRNA driven by DEC-205 promoter. If this were the case, the DCL-1 5′-untranslated region should contain at least some DEC-205 gene sequences. To assess this possibility, we performed RNA ligase-mediated 5′-RACE using HL-60 total RNA and determined the DCL-1 transcription initiation site (Fig. 5). This procedure is designed to amplify cDNA only from full-length, capped mRNA, and suitable to determine the transcription initiation site. Two rounds of DCL-1-specific PCR amplification of the DCL-1 cDNA yielded a ∼250-bp single band regardless of primers (random decamers or DCL-1-specific primer 061) for reverse transcription (Fig. 5A). Sequencing of the 5′-RACE product indicated that DCL-1 transcription initiation site is mapped to 44 bp upstream of DCL-1 translation start codon (ATG, A at +1) located within the 5.4-kb intervening sequence between DEC-205 and DCL-1 gene. Thus, the DCL-1 gene is transcribed independently from DEC-205 gene. Therefore, the DEC-205 and DCL-1 fusion mRNA variants appear to be generated by cotranscription of both DEC-205 and DCL-1 genes followed by intergenic splicing to remove the DEC-205 exon 35 alone or exon 34–35 along with DCL-1 exon 1, resulting in DEC-205 exon 34 fused to DCL-1 exon 2 (V34-2) or DEC-205 exon 33 fused to DCL-1 exon 2 (V33-2) (see Fig. 1). The DNA sequences of DEC-205/DCL-1 fusion mRNA variants and DCL-1 mRNA were submitted to the GenBank™ and assigned the accession number AY184222 (for V34-2), AY314006 (for V33-2), and AY314007 (for DCL-1), respectively.

While the crucial role of anaplerosis for hepatic gluconeogenesis is self-evident, investigations in the heart suggested that stimulating anaplerosis from exogenous substrates could become part of the treatment of myocardial reperfusion injury and other cardiomyopathies (5Bunger R.

Invest. 2002; 110: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the hypoglycemia as well as the mechanical performance of the heart and muscle of patients suffering from long chain fatty acid oxidation defects was greatly improved by replacing the fat component of their therapeutic diet, i.e. trioctanoin (a medium-even-chain triglyceride) by triheptanoin (a medium-odd-chain triglyceride). The only difference between the metabolisms of octanoate and heptanoate is the production of propionyl-CoA from the latter. In a follow-up investigation in pig hearts, propionate infusion was found to be a very effective anaplerotic substrate. Anaplerosis from 0.25 mm [U-13C3]propionate amounted to 9% of the rate of the CAC (12Kasumov T. Martini W.Z. Reszko A.E. Bian F. Pierce B. David F. Roe C.R. Brunengraber H.

This led us to investigate the regulation of the propionyl-CoA pathway in livers and hearts of animals. Propionyl-CoA is formed from the activation of propionate and from the catabolism of isoleucine, valine, threonine, methionine, cholesterol, odd-chain fatty acids, and C5-ketone bodies (14Leclerc J. Des Rosiers C. Montgomery J.A. Brunet J. Ste-Marie L. Reider M.W. Fernandez C.A. Powers L. David F. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E446-E452PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian tissues, the metabolism of propionyl-CoA (Fig. 1) involves (i) the formation of (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA by biotin-dependent propionyl-CoA carboxylase (15Kaziro Y. Ochoa S. Warner R.C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1917-1923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) the conversion of (S)- to (R)-methylmalonyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA racemase (16Mazumder R. Sasakawa T.

Early in vitro work with purified enzymes revealed different degrees of reversibility of the reactions catalyzed by propionyl-CoA carboxylase (21Tietz A. Ochoa S. J. Biol.

In the presence of a mixture of purified propionyl-CoA carboxylase, methylmalonyl-CoA racemase, and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, only a few percent of the radioactivity of [14C]succinyl-CoA (prepared from [1-14C]succinate) was recovered in CO2 released by the reversal of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (16Mazumder R. Sasakawa T. Kaziro Y. Ochoa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3065-3068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these studies on purified enzymes, one cannot draw conclusions on the degree of reversibility of the reactions of the propionyl-CoA pathway in intact organs. To the best of our review of the literature, there have been only few attempts at testing the reversibility of the propionyl-CoA pathway in intact mammalian tissues, in the absence of biotin or cobalamine deficiency (25Montgomery J.A. Mamer O.A. Scriver C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 1937-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A characterization of the reversibility and of the degree of thermodynamic equilibrium of the pathway would allow one to predict the efficiency of anaplerotic interventions with propionyl-CoA precursors. We took advantage of recent developments in mass isotopomer analysis 2Mass isotopomers are designated as M n , where n is the number of atomic mass units above the molecular weight of the unlabeled isotopomer M. (26Brunengraber H. Kelleher J.K. Des Rosiers C. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 559-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) to evaluate the reversibility of propionyl-CoA carboxylase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in intact rat livers and hearts. Chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma. NaH13CO3, [U-13C3]propionate, [U-13C3]lactate, and [U-13C3]pyruvate (99%) were purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). A standard of [U-13C3]propionyl-CoA was prepared from [U-13C3]propionate and purified by HPLC (27Kasumov T. Martini W.Z. Reszko A.E. Bian F. Pierce B.A. David F. Roe C.R. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Hearts from overnight-fasted Sprague-Dawley rats (180–220 g) were perfused in the Langendorf mode with non-recirculating Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (12 ml/min) containing 25 mm bicarbonate, 5.5 mm glucose, 1 mm lactate, 0.2 mm pyruvate, 50 μm carnitine, and 100 milliunits/ml insulin. Three protocols were conducted. Protocol 1—Unlabeled propionate (0–1 mm) was added to the perfusate from zero time. At t = 15 min, unlabeled bicarbonate was replaced by 40% enriched NaH13CO3 (28Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. Comte B. Pierce B.A. David F. Bederman I.R. Deutsch J. Des Rosiers C. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the heart was quick-frozen at up to 35 min. The enrichment of HCO3-/CO2 was measured in samples of effluent perfusate taken just before clamping the heart. Protocol 2—Unlabeled propionate (0.1–1 mm) was added to the perfusate from zero time. At t = 15 min, unlabeled propionate was replaced by [U-13C3]propionate, and the heart was quick-frozen at 35 min. Protocol 3—Unlabeled propionate (0–1 mm) was added to the perfusate from zero time. At t = 15 min, unlabeled lactate and pyruvate were replaced by 99% enriched [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate, and the heart was quick-frozen at 35 min. Almost identical protocols were conducted on perfused rat livers (29Brunengraber H. Boutry M. Lowenstein J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2656-2669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from overnight-fasted rats except that (i) no insulin or carnitine was added to the perfusate, (ii) the concentrations of unlabeled propionate ranged from 0 to 3 mm, and Protocol 2 did not include lactate and pyruvate in the perfusate. Four anesthetized pigs were thoracotomized and fitted with a pump-controlled bypass between the femoral artery and a branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery (10Panchal A.R. Comte B. Huang H. Kerwin T. Darvish A. Des Rosiers C. Brunengraber H. Stanley W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2390-H2398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NaH13CO3 was infused into the bypass at a rate calculated to achieve a 15% enrichment of HCO3-/CO2 in the infused myocardial territory. The enrichment of HCO3-/CO2 was measured in samples of venous blood from the infused territory just before taking punch biopsies of the myocardium at 10 and 60 min (two pigs at each time point). Frozen tissue (0.2–1 g) is extracted with 4 volumes of ice-cold 6% perchloric acid using a Polytron homogenizer. After centrifugation, the acid extract is mixed with 3 volumes of 75 mm potassium phosphate buffer pH 4. The solution is transferred to a glass syringe from which it is slowly pushed through an oligonucleotide purification cartridge (ABI Masterpiece, Applied Biosystems) as described by Deutsch et al. (30Deutsch J. Grange E. Rapoport S.I. Purdon A.D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) for the isolation of long chain acyl-CoAs from tissue extracts. The cartridge is then rinsed with 5 ml of water. The short chain acyl-CoAs are eluted from the cartridge with 1 ml of 50% acetonitrile in water. The acetonitrile/water fraction is evaporated in a Savant vacuum centrifuge at room temperature. The residue is dissolved in 1 ml of water which is divided into two aliquots for the assays of the mass isotopomer distributions of (i) propionyl-CoA via propionylsarcosine pentafluorobenzyl ester and (ii) methylmalonyl-CoA 3The mass spectrometric assay of methylmalonyl-CoA does not differentiate between the S and R enantiomers. and succinyl-CoA via the tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives of the corresponding acids (27Kasumov T.

Pierce B.A. David F. Bederman I.R. Deutsch J. Des Rosiers C. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The measured mass isotopomer distributions were corrected for the contributions of naturally occurring heavy isotopes (31Fernandez C.A. Des Rosiers C. Previs S.F. David F. Brunengraber H. J. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 31: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In the experiments with NaH13CO3 tracer, the enrichment of HCO3-/CO2 in perfusate or blood was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (32Marsolais C. Lafreniere F. David F. Dodgson S.J. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19761-19764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fractional contribution of succinyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA via the reversal of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reaction (FCSucc-CoA → MMA-CoA) can be calculated from the M2 enrichments of methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA labeled from [U-13C3]propionate or from [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate. The calculation assumes that the two methylmalonyl-CoA enantiomers are in isotopic equilibrium. This assumption is validated under “Discussion.” Since, with the above tracers, M2 succinyl-CoA is the only source of M2 methylmalonyl-CoA, the balance of M2 isotopomers of methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA yields Equation 1, (MFM2MMA-CoA)=(FCSucc-CoA→MMA-CoA)(MFM2Succ-CoA)(Eq. 1) where MFM2 MMA-CoA and MFM2 Succ-CoA are the mole fractions of M2 methylmalonyl-CoA and M2 succinyl-CoA, respectively. Similar equations can be written for the balances of the M1 and M3 isotopomers of methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA. We chose not to use the other equations for the following reasons. The M1 enrichments of the CoA esters are often very low and are measured over high M1 natural abundances of the tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives of methylmalonate and succinate (28% both for M1 versus 10.9% for M2). Second, the equation with the M3 isotopomers has an additional term that takes into account that M3 propionyl-CoA is also a source of M3 methylmalonyl-CoA, thus compounding the effect of biological and analytical variability of the measured parameters. A similar rationale is the basis of Equation 2, which allows calculating the fractional contribution of methylmalonyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA via the reversal of the propionyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. (MFM2Pr-CoA)=(FCMMA-CoA→Pr-CoA)(MFM2MMA-CoA)(Eq. 2) Data are expressed as means of the parameters calculated from triplicate gas chromatography-mass spectrometry injections in the analysis of a given tissue or effluent perfusate sample for a given perfusion. We present data from about 50 organ perfusion experiments. For each of the experimental conditions chosen, we ran all perfusions with one parameter (time or concentration of one substrate) being allowed to vary. We tested the reversibility of the reactions of the propionyl-CoA pathway in perfused rat livers and hearts using three types of isotopic tracers, i.e. NaH13CO3, [U-13C3]propionate, or [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate, in the presence of increasing concentrations of propionate that are within physiological/therapeutic range. Perfusions with NaH13CO3—First, we followed the time course of the labeling of liver methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA from bicarbonate. Fig. 2A shows that the labeling of methylmalonyl-CoA plateaued at about one-third that of bicarbonate. The labeling of succinyl-CoA was only about 110 of that of methylmalonyl-CoA. Similar data were obtained in perfused rat hearts, except that the labeling of methylmalonyl-CoA was only 110 that of bicarbonate (Fig. 2B). We interpreted data of Fig. 2 as suggesting that the enrichment of methylmalonyl-CoA was diluted via the reversal of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reaction. We reasoned that the reversal of the mutase reaction would be decreased by increasing the flow of unlabeled carbon through the propionyl-CoA pathway. We perfused livers and hearts with buffer containing 40% enriched NaH13CO3 and increasing concentrations of unlabeled propionate. The M1 enrichment of methylmalonyl-CoA in livers (Fig. 3A) and hearts (Fig. 3B) increased with the concentration of unlabeled propionate and plateaued at a level very close to the enrichment of bicarbonate. In contrast, the M1 enrichment of succinyl-CoA in livers (Fig. 3A) and hearts (Fig. 3B) plateaued at about one-half and one-fifth, respectively, of that of bicarbonate. Note that the data of Fig. 3, A and B, for 0 mm propionate are similar to those of Fig. 2, A and B (experiments without propionate). Perfusions with [U-13C3]Propionate—In livers and hearts perfused with increasing concentrations of [U-13C3]propionate, the M3 enrichment of methylmalonyl-CoA increased with the [U-13C3]propionate concentration (Fig. 4, A and B). The M3 enrichment of propionyl-CoA was very close to that of methylmalonyl-CoA (not shown). A trace of M2 enrichment of propionyl-CoA was detected in the presence of 0.1 mm [U-13C3]propionate, but its value could not be determined with precision. In addition, small amounts of M2 and M1 isotopomers of methylmalonyl-CoA were formed (Fig. 4, A and B). The mass isotopomer distribution of succinyl-CoA (Fig. 4, C and D) showed substantial proportions of M1 to M3 isotopomers. Perfusions with [U-13C3]Lactate + [U-13C3]Pyruvate—In livers and hearts perfused with 1 mm [U-13C3]lactate + 0.2 mm [U-13C3]pyruvate and 0 mm unlabeled propionate, all three labeled mass isotopomers of methylmalonyl-CoA were present in variable proportions (see left side of Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, a very small amount of M2 propionyl-CoA was detected (2.8% in liver, 3.9% in heart). When the concentration of unlabeled propionate was increased, (i) the proportions of M1 to M3 isotopomers of methylmalonyl-CoA decreased to almost zero (Fig. 5, A and B), and (ii) no label was detected in propionyl-CoA. The same livers and hearts contained substantial proportions of M1, M2, and M3 isotopomers of succinyl-CoA (Fig. 5, C and D). In the hearts, the distribution of the succinyl-CoA isotopomers was not affected much by increasing the concentration of unlabeled propionate (Fig. 5D). In contrast, in livers perfused under identical conditions, the proportions of the M1 to M3 isotopomers decreased with the concentration of unlabeled propionate (Fig. 5C). Reversibility of the Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase Reaction— The M2 enrichments of methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA labeled from [U-13C3]propionate (Fig. 4) were introduced into Equation 1 to compute the fractional contribution of succinyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA, an index of the reversibility of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reaction. Fig. 6 (solid symbols) shows this index as a function of the propionate concentration. To compute this index for 0 mm propionate (Fig. 6, open symbols), we used the M2 enrichments of methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA labeled from [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate (left ends of the four panels of Fig. 5). Fig. 6 shows that the contribution of succinyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA is very high (>90%) in liver and heart in the absence of extracellular propionate. As the concentration of propionate increases, this contribution decreases to low levels (about 10%). To estimate the level of reversibility of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reaction in vivo, we infused NaH13CO3 in a branch of the coronary artery of four anesthetized pigs. In the infused myocardial area, the M1 labeling ratios [methylmalonyl-CoA]/[bicarbonate] and [succinyl-CoA]/[bicarbonate] ranged from 36 to 53% and from 1.0 to 2.3%, respectively. These relative percentages are similar to those observed in rat hearts perfused in the absence of propionate (Fig. 2B). The arterial concentration of propionate in the pigs was about 0.03 mm. The present study was designed to characterize the reactions of the propionyl-CoA pathway in liver and heart, emphasizing the reversibility of the reactions and their impact on the labeling pattern of the CoA intermediates. For this purpose, we perfused livers and hearts with NaH13CO3, [U-13C3] propionate, or [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate at various propionate concentrations. The rapid labeling of methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA from 40% enriched bicarbonate reflected a rapid turnover of the intermediates (Fig. 2, A and B). The enrichment of succinyl-CoA was low because of dilution of label in the CAC. However, the enrichment of methylmalonyl-CoA, formed by propionyl-CoA carboxylation, was much lower than that of bicarbonate in both livers and hearts, suggesting that the enrichment of methylmalonyl-CoA was diluted via the reversal of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reaction. As the concentration of unlabeled propionate in the perfusate was increased, the labeling of methylmalonyl-CoA increased until it equaled that of extracellular bicarbonate (Fig. 3, A and B). This confirmed that, in the absence of extracellular propionate, the labeling of methylmalonyl-CoA from bicarbonate was diluted by the reversal of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reaction. Also, the identical enrichment of methylmalonyl-CoA2 and bicarbonate at high propionate concentration demonstrated, albeit indirectly, the isotopic equilibration of the methylmalonyl-CoA enantiomers. We then set out to explore the reversibility of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase by channeling label either via propionyl-CoA (using [U-13C3]propionate) or via the CAC and succinyl-CoA (using [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate). The use of uniformly labeled substrates and mass isotopomer distribution analysis provides a greater wealth of information than singly labeled substrates, especially when label passes through the CAC (33Des Rosiers C.

In livers and hearts perfused with increasing concentrations of [U-13C3]propionate, the mass isotopomer distribution of methylmalonyl-CoA was characterized mostly by the M3 isotopomer, the abundance of which was greater than 90% (Fig. 4, A and B). This also reflects the isotopic equilibration of the methylmalonyl-CoA enantiomers. In addition, we observed small but clearly identifiable amounts of M2 and M1 isotopomers of methylmalonyl-CoA, which could not be derived directly from M3 propionate. The origin of the M2 and M1 isotopomers of methylmalonyl-CoA becomes evident when one examines the mass isotopomer distributions of succinyl-CoA, which include M3, M2, and M1 isotopomers (Fig. 4, C and D). In the heart, the proportions of the three enriched mass isotopomers of succinyl-CoA are similar. The markedly different isotopomer enrichment patterns of liver and heart succinyl-CoA at the various propionate concentrations reflects these organs' differential capacity for propionate metabolism as well as for anaplerosis. In the livers, the proportions of the three enriched mass isotopomers of succinyl-CoA are different (M3 > M2 > M1), presumably because of additional isotopic exchanges in the pyruvate → oxaloacetate → phosphoenolpyruvate → pyruvate cycle. In both livers and hearts perfused with [U-13C3]propionate, the M2 and M1 mass isotopomers of succinyl-CoA are clearly the precursors of the M2 and M1 isotopomers of methylmalonyl-CoA. This provides direct evidence for the reversibility of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reaction. Probing the propionyl-CoA pathway with NaH13CO3 or [U-13C3]propionate could not yield information on the possible reversibility of the propionyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. This is why we labeled the pathway via the CAC and succinyl-CoA using [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled propionate. With 0 mm propionate, the mass isotopomer distribution of heart succinyl-CoA showed similar proportions of the M1 to M3 isotopomers (left side of Fig. 5D). This again reflects and is compatible with the relatively low entry of unlabeled carbon through anaplerosis in the heart compared with liver. The proportions of the M1 to M3 isotopomers of succinyl-CoA are not markedly affected by increasing concentrations of unlabeled propionate. This probably results from the small ratio of (anaplerotic flux of propionyl-CoA)/(CAC), i.e. less than 10%, observed under similar conditions (12Kasumov T. Martini W.Z. Reszko A.E. Bian F. Pierce B. David F. Roe C.R. Brunengraber H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: A33Google Scholar, 13Martini W.Z. Stanley W.C. Huang H. Des Rosiers C. Hoppel C.L. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E351-E356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the same hearts, the methylmalonyl-CoA pool also included M1 to M3 isotopomers in a proportion that decreased as the concentration of unlabeled propionate increased in the perfusate. Comparison between the mass isotopomer patterns of heart succinyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA supports the conclusion that methylmalonyl-CoA is derived from succinyl-CoA. This also demonstrates that the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reaction is reversible in the heart and that this reversibility is decreased by increasing the flux through the propionyl-CoA pathway. We detected a low M2 labeling of propionyl-CoA from [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate (2.8% in liver, 3.9% in heart), but only in the absence of exogenous propionate. When the M2 enrichments of propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA were introduced in Equation 2, the fractional contributions of methylmalonyl-CoA to propionyl-CoA were 6 and 19% in liver and heart, respectively. When unlabeled propionate was added to the perfusate, no enrichment of propionyl-CoA from [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate was detectable. Therefore, under our conditions, there was a slight reversibility of the propionyl-CoA carboxylase reaction, but only in the absence of exogenous propionate. The data obtained in livers perfused with [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate and increasing concentrations of unlabeled propionate (Fig. 5, A and C) were similar to the perfused heart experiments (Fig. 5, B and D), with one exception. In livers, the proportions of the M1 to M3 isotopomers of succinyl-CoA markedly decreased as the concentration of unlabeled propionate in the perfusate was increased. Again this reflects the greater capacity of the liver for anaplerosis and for the metabolism of propionate to oxaloacetate and pyruvate. A quantitative index of the reversibility of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, i.e. the fractional contribution of succinyl-CoA to the methylmalonyl-CoA pool was calculated from the M2 enrichments of methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA (Fig. 6). In isolated livers and hearts perfused without propionate, more than 90% of methylmalonyl-CoA was derived from the reversal of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. This high fractional contribution does not represent a net supply of methylmalonyl-CoA, but a rapid interconversion of the two CoA esters at no energy cost. Thus, in the absence of exogenous propionate, the net supply of methylmalonyl-CoA (less than 10%) results from the small flow of propionyl-CoA presumably derived from the catabolism of endogenous aminoacids. However, the rapid interconversion of methylmalonyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA has a major effect on the former's labeling pattern. This is because the labeling pattern of succinyl-CoA is strongly influenced by the CAC and related pathways. This explains the major dilution of the enrichment of methylmalonyl-CoA labeled from NaH13CO3 (Fig. 2, A and B, and left sides of Fig. 3, A and B). As the concentration of propionate is increased in the perfusate, the reversibility of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase decreases (Fig. 6), and the labeling of methylmalonyl-CoA from NaH13CO3 becomes very close to that of the latter (Fig. 3, A and B). To what extent is the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reaction reversible in vivo? In non-ruminant mammals, the arterial concentration of propionate is very low (5 μm in dogs (35Puchowicz M.A. Bederman I.R. Comte B. Yang D. David F. Stone E. Jabbour K. Wasserman D.H. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1022-E1027PubMed Google Scholar), 30 μm in pigs (13Martini W.Z. Stanley W.C. Huang H. Des Rosiers C. Hoppel C.L. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E351-E356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). From Fig. 6, one would expect marked reversibility of the reaction in the heart. This conclusion is supported by our data obtained in the pig heart perfused in situ with 15% 13C-labeled bicarbonate. In the liver of non-ruminant mammals, the portal vein propionate concentration is about 0.2 mm (35Puchowicz M.A. Bederman I.R. Comte B. Yang D. David F. Stone E. Jabbour K. Wasserman D.H. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1022-E1027PubMed Google Scholar), which should somewhat slow down the reversibility of the mutase reaction. In both heart and liver, the reversibility of the mutase should be markedly decreased after ingestion of a diet rich in triheptanoin, a precursor of propionyl-CoA used to boost anaplerosis in patients with long chain fatty acid oxidation defects (11Roe C.R. Sweetman L. Roe D.S. David F. Brunengraber H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Last, in ruminant mammals with high propionate concentrations in the portal and arterial blood, there is probably little reversibility of the mutase. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase is generally referred to as catalyzing a reversible reaction (20Fenton W.A. Gravel R.A. Rosenblatt D.S. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Diseases. McGraw-Hill, New York2001: 2165-2193Google Scholar). Kaziro et al. (15Kaziro Y. Ochoa S. Warner R.C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1917-1923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) commented that, based on the equilibrium constant of 5.7 and the ΔF of –1028 calories/mol, the reaction is readily reversible. Our data are at variance with this conclusion for two reasons. First, in perfusions with [U-13C3]propionate, propionyl-CoA was only M3 labeled, while methylmalonyl-CoA was labeled in M3, M2, and M1 (Fig. 4, A and B). Second, in perfusions with [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate and 0 mm propionate, the labeling of propionyl-CoA was very low (less than 4% M2, not shown). When unlabeled propionate was added to the perfusate, no label was detectable in propionyl-CoA. In contrast, the labeling of methylmalonyl-CoA from [U-13C3]lactate + [U-13C3]pyruvate was substantial in M3, M2, and M1 (Fig. 5, A and B). We propose that the very low reversibility of the propionyl-CoA carboxylase reaction in intact livers and hearts results from the fact that the mass action ratio of this reaction is far from equilibrium. The equilibrium constant of the propionyl-CoA carboxylase reaction allows one to calculate that, at thermodynamic equilibrium, the mass action ratio [(S)-methylmalonyl-CoA]/[propionyl-CoA] should be about 10. This is based on reported values for the mitochondrial [ATP]/[ADP] ratio of 0.5 in liver (36Elbers R. Heldt H.W. Schmucker P. Soboll S. Wiese H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1974; 355: 378-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) mitochondrial [Pi] of 7.5 mm (36Elbers R. Heldt H.W. Schmucker P. Soboll S. Wiese H. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1974; 355: 378-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and an assumed [HCO3-] of 25 mm. Since the equilibrium constant of methylmalonyl-CoA racemase is 1.0 (23Allen S.H.G. Kellermeyer R.W. Wood H.G. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 194-198Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and since we have evidence that the pool of tissue methylmalonyl-CoA is racemic, we would expect the mass action ratio [(R,S)-methylmalonyl-CoA]/[propionyl-CoA] to be about 20 if the combined propionyl-CoA carboxylase + methylmalonyl-CoA racemase reaction were at thermodynamic equilibrium. In fact, we found that the ratio [(R,S)-methylmalonyl-CoA]/[propionyl-CoA] is about 0.6 in rat livers perfused without or with 1 mm propionate (27Kasumov T. Martini W.Z. Reszko A.E. Bian F. Pierce B.A. David F. Roe C.R. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We can, therefore, conclude that the propionyl-CoA carboxylase reaction is quite far from thermodynamic equilibrium in the intact liver. This rationale can be extended to the combined equilibrium constant of the reactions catalyzed by propionyl-CoA carboxylase, methylmalonyl-CoA racemase, and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (K′ = 18.6 (24Mazumder R. Ochoa S. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 198-207Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar)). Then, the [succinyl-CoA]/[propionyl-CoA] ratio should be 177 at thermodynamic equilibrium. In fact, we found that the ratio is (i) 3.7 and 0.14 in rat livers perfused without or with 1 mm propionate, respectively, and (ii) 18 and 0.3 in hearts perfused without or with 1 mm propionate, respectively. The measured [succinyl-CoA]/[propionyl-CoA] ratio is one to three orders of magnitude smaller than its thermodynamic equilibrium value (12Kasumov T. Martini W.Z. Reszko A.E. Bian F. Pierce B. David F. Roe C.R. Brunengraber H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: A33Google Scholar, 27Kasumov T. Martini W.Z. Reszko A.E. Bian F. Pierce B.A. David F. Roe C.R. Brunengraber H. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The dis-equilibrium of the propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA reaction sequence reflects the drawing of succinyl-CoA derived from propionyl-CoA into the CAC. This explains the efficiency of anaplerosis from a low concentration (0.25 mm) of [U-13C3]propionate in pig heart (9% of the flux through the CAC (13Martini W.Z. Stanley W.C. Huang H. Des Rosiers C. Hoppel C.L. Brunengraber H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E351-E356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that in intact normal rat livers and hearts, (i) the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase reaction is partly reversible and that this reversibility is modulated by the propionyl-CoA flux, (ii) the methylmalonyl-CoA enantiomers are maintained in isotopic equilibrium via the reversible methylmalonyl-CoA racemase reaction, and (iii) the reversibility of the propionyl-CoA carboxylase reaction is minor. The dis-equilibrium of the propionyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA reaction sequence explains the effectiveness of anaplerosis from low concentrations of propionyl-CoA precursors such as propionate or heptanoate (11Roe C.R. Sweetman L. Roe D.S. David F. Brunengraber H. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 13Martini W.Z. Stanley W.C. Huang H. Des Rosiers C. Hoppel C.L.

These bacteria have been isolated from freshwater, salt water, and a variety of foods and are frequently isolated from patients with diarrhea and wound infections. Aeromonas spp. produce an impressive array of virulence factors, including hemolysins, cytotonic and cytotoxic enterotoxins, proteases, lipases, leucocidins, endotoxin, adhesions, and an S-layer (2Chopra A.K.

Our laboratory isolated and molecularly characterized an aerolysin-related cytotoxic enterotoxin (Act) from Aeromonas hydrophila that possesses several biological activities (5Ferguson M.R. Xu X.J. Houston C.W. Peterson J.W. Coppenhaver D.H. Popov V.L. Chopra A.K. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4299-4308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Act causes lysis of red blood cells, is cytotoxic to intestinal and non-intestinal cells, evokes intestinal fluid secretion, and is lethal in nanogram quantities (27 ng) when injected intravenously into mice (2Chopra A.K. Houston C.W. Microbes Infect. 1999; 1: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5Ferguson M.R. Xu X.J. Houston C.W. Peterson J.W. Coppenhaver D.H. Popov V.L. Chopra A.K. Infect.

In subsequent studies, we demonstrated for the first time that Act up-regulated the expression of genes encoding proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)) and the inducible nitric-oxide synthase gene in murine macrophages. Act activated arachidonic acid metabolism via the induction of group V phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), resulting in the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Act also up-regulated cellular cAMP concentration, which, along with PGE2, contributed to the enterotoxic response associated with Act (7Chopra A.K. Xu X. Ribardo D. Gonzalez M. Kuhl K. Peterson J.W. Houston C.W. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2808-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated in macrophages that Act induced the rapid mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores, as well as an influx of calcium from the extracellular medium. The rise in intracellular calcium modulated the production of TNF-α and PGE2 via activation of NF-κB (7Chopra A.K. Xu X. Ribardo D. Gonzalez M. Kuhl K. Peterson J.W. Houston C.W. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2808-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 8Ribardo D.A. Kuhl K.R. Boldogh I. Peterson J.W. Houston C.W. Chopra A.K. Microb. Pathog. 2002; 32: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition to activation of NF-κB, Act treatment of macrophages resulted in activation of the transcription factor cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Taken together, the data demonstrated a direct role for Act in the induction of the host inflammatory response, which was confirmed in vivo (6Sha J. Kozlova E.V. Chopra A.K. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The induction of key inflammatory mediators seen in Act-treated macrophages might result from involvement of Act in one or more signal transduction pathways (8Ribardo D.A. Kuhl K.R. Boldogh I. Peterson J.W. Houston C.W. Chopra A.K. Microb. Pathog. 2002; 32: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Act binds to cholesterol, which could target the toxin to lipid rafts and initiate signaling (5Ferguson M.R. Xu X.J. Houston C.W. Peterson J.W. Coppenhaver D.H. Popov V.L. Chopra A.K. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 4299-4308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our investigation of macrophage stress response factors showed that Act caused activation of kinase cascades (tyrosine kinase and protein kinase A), induced redox stress factors (Ref. 1Janda J.M. Abbott S.L. Clin. Infect Dis. 1998; 27: 332-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (8Ribardo D.A. Kuhl K.R. Boldogh I. Peterson J.W. Houston C.W. Chopra A.K. Microb. Pathog. 2002; 32: 149-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Act also induced the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in murine macrophages (7Chopra A.K. Xu X. Ribardo D. Gonzalez M. Kuhl K. Peterson J.W. Houston C.W. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2808-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Act treatment of macrophages causes cell death, which is both dose- and time-dependent, and up-regulation of Bcl-2 suggests that apoptosis may be the mechanism of cell death or an attempt by the cell to avert apoptosis triggered by stress (9Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 10Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4819) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated that Act indeed evoked apoptosis in macrophages, and we identified potential signaling molecules that could be involved in Act-induced apoptosis. Although the impetus for signaling is not known, it seems probable that Act directly modulates one or more host cell signaling pathways. To investigate global cellular responses to Act and possibly identify new genes involved in Act-induced signaling, we applied DNA array technology. In an attempt to address the notorious variability commonly seen with data generated from microarrays, we performed the experiments in triplicate with three time points, generating a total of nine arrays. Additionally, we employed several different analysis techniques and expected a high level of consistency to allow a treatment-induced change in gene expression to be considered significant. Our data were quite consistent, with 76 genes identified as significant across all analyses. The microarray data clearly demonstrated a strong host cell inflammatory response to Act, up-regulation of several genes not previously known to be induced by Act, and the strong likelihood of apoptosis as the mechanism of Act-induced cell death. We verified Act-induced changes in the expression of several genes, including macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (Mip-2), Mip-1α, RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed), JunB, TNF receptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1), T-cell death-associated gene 51 (TDAG51), suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), and growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein GADD45β, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or real-time RT-PCR. Selection of genes to be verified was based on their known involvement in inflammatory, apoptotic, or stress responses. For example, Mip-2, Mip-1α, and RANTES are potent chemokines that contribute to the recruitment of circulating monocytes into inflamed tissues (11Cavaillon J.M. Biomed. Pharmacother. 1994; 48: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). SOCS3, on the other hand, is itself activated by cytokines and serves to alter subsequent cytokine signaling, possibly as a negative feedback mechanism to dampen excessive inflammation (12Kovanen P.E. Leonard W.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R899-R902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture—The murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). For each experiment, 5 × 105 cells/ml were plated in 35-mm dishes and allowed to attach overnight. The medium was removed, and fresh medium containing the stimulant (6 ng/ml, unless otherwise stated, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-free Act) was added (7Chopra A.K. Xu X. Ribardo D. Gonzalez M. Kuhl K. Peterson J.W. Houston C.W. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2808-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After each time point, the supernatant was collected and RNA extracted using the RNAqueous kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Microarray Analysis—RNA was isolated at 0, 2, and 12 h from Act-treated macrophages, and 20 μg of total RNA was processed for microarray analysis. Briefly, cDNA synthesis, in vitro transcription, and labeling and fragmentation to produce the oligonucleotide probes were performed as instructed by the GeneChip manufacturer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The probes were first hybridized to a test array (Affymetrix) and then to the GeneChip murine genome MGU74Av2, both performed using the GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640. The chips were washed in a GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 (Affymetrix), and the results were visualized with a Gene Array scanner using the Affymetrix software. Data were analyzed using MAS 5.0 software (Affymetrix), Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM; Stanford University, Stanford, CA), GeneSpring 4.2 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA), and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Computational hierarchical cluster analysis was performed using Spotfire DecisionSite 7.1 (Spotfire Inc., Somerville, MA), Cluster/Treeview (Eisen Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA), 2Eisen laboratory (rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). CLUSFAVOR 6.0 (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), and ArrayMiner2 (Optimal Design, Brussels, Belgium). Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed using Spotfire 7.1. RT-PCR—The Advantage RT-PCR kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used to synthesize cDNA from total RNA of Act-induced RAW cells as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, to 1 μg of total RNA was added oligo(dT)18 primer (20 μm) in a total volume of 12.5 μl made up with diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. The RNA and primer were heated at 70 °C for 2 min and then quenched on ice immediately. Subsequently, the following reagents were added: 4.0 μl of 5× reaction buffer (Clontech), 1.0 μl of deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) mixture (10 mm each), 0.5 μl of recombinant RNase inhibitor (40 units/μl), and 1.0 μl of recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus RT (200 units/μl). The mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h, and the cDNA synthesis was stopped by heating the reaction mixture at 94 °C for 5 min. The reaction mixture was then diluted to a final volume of 100 μl with DEPC-treated water. The Advantage 2 PCR kit (Clontech) was used to amplify the cDNA by PCR as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, the following reagents were added to 5 μl of cDNA sample: 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 36 μl of sterile water, 1 μl of dNTP mixture (10 mm each), 1 μl of Advantage Taq DNA polymerase (5 units/μl), 2 μl of premixed human GAPDH amplimer (10 μm (each) primer; for internal control), and 2 μl each of the tested primer pairs (20 μm) for mouse Mip-1α (fragment size, 154 bp) and mouse RANTES (fragment size, 177 bp) (obtained from BioSource International, Camarillo, CA) or 1 μl each of custom-designed 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides for JunB (fragment size, 848 bp), TRAF1 (fragment size, 423 bp), and TDAG51 (fragment size, 349 bp). Custom-designed primers used were as follows: 5′-ACGGAGGGAGAGAAAAGCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATGTGGGAGGTAGCTGATGG-3′ (reverse) (JunB), 5′-GCACTTGGTGAAGGAGAAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCTTCTTGCCTGAGCCATC-3′ (reverse) (TRAF1), and 5′-GAAGGATGCTGGAGAACAGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGAAAGTCGATCTCTTTGCC-3′ (reverse) (TDAG51). PCR was performed by temperature cycling (30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min). The PCR product was run on a 0.8% agarose gel (for JunB) or a 2% agarose gel and subjected to densitometric scanning, and the -fold increase in the level of a particular cDNA was normalized to the GAPDH product. Each experiment included a negative control in which RNA was omitted from the RT mixture and cDNA was omitted from the PCR. ELISA—The purified anti-Mip-2 capture antibodies (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) were diluted to 1-4 μg/ml in binding solution (0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 9.0) and then added to the wells of an enzyme immunoassay high-binding microtiter plate (Corning Costar, Corning, NY). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the capture antibodies were removed, and any nonspecific binding was blocked by adding 200 μl of blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) to each well. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 1-2 h, after which wells were washed three times with PBS-Tween 20 (0.05%) buffer. An aliquot (100 μl) of sample or standard was added, and the plate was incubated overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the plate was washed four times with PBS-Tween, detection antibodies (biotinylated anticytokine; Pharmingen) were diluted to 0.5-2 μg/ml in blocking buffer-Tween and added to the wells, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After the plate was washed four times with PBS-Tween, an enzyme conjugate (streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase) was diluted to an optimal concentration in blocking buffer-Tween and added to the wells. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then washed five times with PBS-Tween. Next, 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) substrate solution (150 mg of ABTS in 0.1 m anhydrous citric acid, adjusted to pH 4.35 with sodium hydroxide) was vortexed, and 100 μl of 3% H2O2 was added to each 11 ml of substrate solution. A 100-μl aliquot was dispensed in each well, and the plate was incubated (5-80 min) for color development. The color reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of stopping solution (20% SDS, 50% dimethyl formamide), and the optical density was read with a microtiter ELISA plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) at 405 nm. Real-time RT-PCR—Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed on the LightCycler thermal cycler system (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) using SYBR Green I dye (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, 200 ng of RNA was placed into a 20-μl reaction volume containing 1 μg of each primer, 10 μl of SYBR Green PCR master mix, and 0.2 μl of reverse transcriptase. A typical protocol included reverse transcription at 55 °C for 20 min and a denaturation step at 95 °C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles with 95 °C denaturation for 15 s, 55 °C annealing for 20 s, and 72 °C extension for 20 s. The temperature transition rate was set at 20 °C/s. Detection of the fluorescent product was performed at the end of the extension period at 80 °C for 10 s. To confirm amplification specificity, the PCR products were subjected to a melting curve analysis. Negative controls containing water instead of RNA were concomitantly run to confirm that the samples were not cross-contaminated. Targets were normalized to reactions performed using GAPDH amplimers (BIOSOURCE), and -fold change was determined with the LightCycler analysis software, as previously described (14Wittwer C.T. Herrmann M.G. Moss A.A. Rasmussen R.P. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Custom primers were designed as follows: 5′-AAGCTGACAGGATATCGGCGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGATGACTCGGAGGATCTTCGGTGCC-3′ (reverse) (JunB), 5′-AAGAGATCGACTTTCGGTGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCTTCTGCCTGGTAGACTTGA-3′ (reverse) (TDAG51), 5′-CGAGTTTCAATTTGGTTGCCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGATCCTCATCATCTCTCAGG-3′ (reverse) (TRAF1), 5′-AAGATTCCGCTGGTACTGAGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCTCATAGGAGTCCAGGTGGC-3′ (reverse) (SOCS3), 5′-CCTGCGGAACAGTGAAATGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCGATCTGTCTTGCTCAGCAC-3′ (reverse) (GADD45β). These primers would amplify DNA fragments in the size range of 100-250 bp that is optimal for real-time RT-PCR. Detection of Macrophage Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry Analysis—Variously stimulated macrophages (1 × 106) were stained with annexin V conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) by using a TACS annexin V-FITC staining kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were suspended in 100 μl of annexin V binding buffer and incubated with 1 μl of annexin V and 10 μl of PI for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Four hundred μl of annexin V binding buffer was then added, and at least 20,000 cells were acquired in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer using the CellQuest 3.0.1 software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Percentages of cells undergoing apoptosis were determined by dual-color analysis. This staining allowed us to distinguish three subsets of cells: viable cells (annexin V-negative and PI-negative), early apoptotic cells (annexin V-positive and PI-negative), and late apoptotic or necrotic cells (annexin V-positive and PI-positive). Immediately after staining, the cells were analyzed on a flow cytometer using 488-nm excitation and a 525-nm bandpass filter for FITC and a 620-nm filter for PI detection. Analysis of DNA Fragmentation—DNA was extracted from stimulated macrophages using the Suicide-Track DNA Ladder Isolation Kit (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA). Monolayer cells and cells in the supernatants were lysed, centrifuged at 1000 × g and processed further as described by the manufacturer. The DNA was ethanol-precipitated, air-dried, and suspended in 50 μl of the kit resuspension buffer. Samples were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining under UV light. Gel Shift Analysis—Gel shift assays were performed as previously described (7Chopra A.K. Xu X. Ribardo D. Gonzalez M. Kuhl K. Peterson J.W. Houston C.W. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2808-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with only minor modifications. Briefly, oligonucleotides corresponding to the consensus AP-1 (5′-AGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′) were annealed by the supplier (Bio-Synthesis, Inc., Lewisville, TX) and labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer. Next DNA-binding reaction mixtures were assembled. We used unlabeled AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide as a specific competitor, unlabeled AP-2 or SP-1 consensus oligonucleotides as nonspecific competitors (Promega), and nuclear extracts from specific time points after Act treatment of RAW cells. Nuclear extracts were prepared using the NE-PER kit (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, followed by addition of 20,000 cpm of 32P-labeled transcription factor consensus oligonucleotide, and incubation for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 1 μl of gel loading 10× buffer (Promega) was added to each reaction mixture and samples (5-20 μg) were loaded on a nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was pre-run in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer for 30 min at 100 V before loading the samples. After completion of the run, the gel was transferred to Whatman 3MM paper, dried at 80 °C for 5 h, and exposed to x-ray film overnight to 48 h. All of the experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and representative data are presented. Act Induces Up-regulation of Inflammatory Genes, Cytokines, Chemokines, Adhesion Molecules, and Transcription Factors in Murine Macrophages—RAW 264.7 cells were treated with a sublethal dose of Act (6 ng/ml) for 0, 2, and 12 h, and the RNA was isolated and applied to MGU74Av2 GeneChips. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and these independent experiments generated a total of nine arrays, each representing ∼6,000 characterized murine genes and ∼6,000 expressed sequence tag clusters. For each experiment (0-, 2-, and 12-h treatments), the genes represented on the three arrays were normalized using the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software (MAS 5.0). Approximately 6,000 genes were disregarded in all analyses, except for clustering, as a result of their lack of expression on any of the nine arrays. The data was analyzed separately using four different techniques: MAS 5.0, SAM, GeneSpring 4.2, and ANOVA. A change in gene expression was considered significant if the p value was less than 0.05, the -fold change at least 2.0, and increased gene expression occurred in at least two out of three experiments. A total of six pairwise comparisons were performed (0 versus 2 and 0 versus 12 h for each of the three experiments) using the MAS 5.0 software. Based on these criteria, 157 genes were up-regulated and 35 down-regulated from 0 to 2 h after treatment of macrophages with Act. From 0 to 12 h, 220 genes were up-regulated and 167 were down-regulated (Table I). For comparison, the number of significant genes identified by SAM and GeneSpring 4.2 are also included in Table I.Table INumber of genes significantly up-regulated/down-regulated by Act in macrophages, as determined by using MAS 5.0, SAM, and Silicon Genetics GeneSpring 4.2 softwares0 vs. 2 h0 vs. 12 hUp-regulatedDown-regulatedUp-regulatedDown-regulatedMAS 5.015735220167SAM12229100GeneSpring 4.2844405 Open table in a new tab SAM software was used to perform two-class unpaired, blocked comparisons for 0 versus 2 and 0 versus 12 h of Act treatment in macrophages. An advantage of SAM is that it generates a table of δ values based on the input signal values that attaches a false detection ratio (FDR) to any given number of genes called significant (Table II). We chose δ values that captured the largest number of significant genes with the lowest FDRs. For 0- versus 2-h treatments, we chose a δ value of 0.38 and -fold change cutoff of 2.0, which yielded 151 significant genes with an FDR of 5.5% (Fig. 1, Table II). For the 0- versus 12-h treatment, SAM generated higher FDRs and yielded fewer genes. For example, a δ value of 1.09 yielded only 10 significant genes with an FDR of 19.9% (Table II). For every analysis method used, including clustering programs, gene expression profiles were much more consistent and reproducible for 0 versus 2 h treatments, and more genes were considered significantly changed by Act treatment of macrophages by 2 h than 12 h. The earlier time point (2 h) is most reliable for studying signaling events, which, given the fact that Act is cytotoxic, should prove useful for elucidating the mechanism of action of Act and its direct effect on host cells. We also performed a multi-class, blocked comparison of all 9 arrays using SAM, which generated 19 significant genes with a δ value of 1.58 and FDR of 4.7% (Table II). All 19 of these genes were also deemed significant by SAM for the two-class, unpaired blocked comparison of 0- and 2-h treatments, and 18 of them were considered significant by all four analysis methods. Given the fact that the expected number of falsely called genes was ∼1 (FDR = 4.7% of 19) and that all but 1 of the 19 genes were also called significant using other analysis methods, we considered SAM to be a useful tool for data mining. The one gene detected by SAM using the multi-class option that was not later included in the most significant gene lists was nuclear autoantigen Sp-100, which was deemed non-significant based solely on the ANOVA value (0.83).Table IISignificance table showing values of δ generated by significance analysis of microarrays software for Act-treated macrophages at 2 and 12 hTreatment comparisonδ valueNo. of genes calledNo. of genes falsely calledFDR%0 vs. 2 h0.1718034.1619.00.1917525.3714.50.381518.305.50.661152.442.20.94940.981.10 vs. 12 h0.4117789.4850.60.4210447.7245.90.553918.6947.90.69177.1642.11.09101.9919.9Multiclass (0 vs. 2 vs. 12 h)0.4819553.1827.30.5713332.3524.30.669521.2722.40.95567.9814.21.58190.894.7 Open table in a new tab GeneSpring 4.2 software was used to further normalize the data, perform pairwise comparisons and hierarchical clustering, and to create Venn diagrams. Data were normalized across all genes and all arrays to allow replicate time points to be averaged and combined. In addition, the experiments were analyzed separately using GeneSpring. Pairwise comparisons were performed for each experiment (0- versus 2-h and 0- versus 12-h treatments), Venn diagrams created for each comparison, and genes included in the significant gene list only if they changed significantly for all three experiments. For 0- versus 2-h treatments, 88 genes were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated for all three experiments (Fig. 2A). Following the same trend seen with other analysis methods, only 45 genes were significantly changed for 0- versus 12-h treatments (Fig. 2B). Finally, ANOVA was performed on all genes from the nine arrays, and a change in gene expression was considered significant if the p value was less than 0.05. Genes that were deemed significant by all four analytical techniques (MAS 5.0, SAM, GeneSpring 4.2, and ANOVA) were compiled into lists that included 84 probe sets representing 76 genes for 0- versus 2-h treatments (Table III) and 10 genes for 0- versus 12-h treatments (data not shown). Examples of genes up-regulated from 0-12 h included LIM and SH3 protein 1 (Las"

Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). RARs and RXRs are modular proteins (Fig. 1) with a highly conserved central DNA-binding domain and a less conserved ligand-binding domain that is composed of 11 α-helices (H1 and H3-H12), loops, and two short β-strands (Ref. 4Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar and references therein) with a dimerization interface formed mainly by helices H9 and H10 (5Bourguet W. Vivat V. Wurtz J.M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 289-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The recent comparison of the crystal structures of the ligand-binding domain of unliganded and liganded RARs and RXRs (1Laudet V. Gronemeyer H. Nuclear Receptor FactsBook.

Timmins P.A. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 557-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying the structural reorganization that accompanies ligand binding. The ligand-induced conformational changes in the ligand-binding domain result in the release of corepressors and in conformational rearrangements that affect mostly the N-terminal part of H3, H11, and the highly conserved amphipathic helix 12, which carries the autonomous activation function AF-2 (8Bourguet W. Germain P. Gronemeyer H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The new conformation generates an interaction surface for coactivators (9Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which then recruit multiprotein complexes and lead to the activation of responsive genes (10Dilworth F.J. Chambon P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3047-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 11McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Through this surface, RARs also interact with SUG-1 (12Gianni M. Bauer A. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3760-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which belongs to the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome (13Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). In RAR/RXR heterodimers, RXR is subordinated to the nonliganded RAR and therefore cannot autonomously induce transcription upon binding of a cognate agonist (14Germain P. Iyer J. Zechel C. Gronemeyer H. Nature. 2002; 415: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of both RAR and RXR ligands, RXR synergizes with RAR for the recruitment of coactivators and thus for the transcription of RA target genes. The N-terminal region of RARs and RXRs contains another transcription activation domain called AF-1, which acts autonomously and ligand-independently (15Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The interesting feature of this AF-1 domain is that it contains consensus phosphorylation sites for proline-dependent kinases (for a review, see Ref. 16Rochette-Egly C. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The AF-1 domain of unliganded RARγ2 (Fig. 1) is phosphorylated at serine 68 (17Bastien J. Adam-Stitah S. Riedl T. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21896-21904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) by cdk7/cyclin H-associated to transcription factor IIH, a general transcription factor also involved in DNA repair (18Egly J.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this serine is required for RA-induced transcription initiation (17Bastien J. Adam-Stitah S. Riedl T. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21896-21904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In response to RA, however, RARγ2 can also be phosphorylated at the nearby serine 66 by p38MAPK (12Gianni M. Bauer A. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3760-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Gianni M. Kopf E. Bastien J. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24859-24862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of RXRα by MAPKs (Fig. 1) at three residues located in the AF-1 domain (Ser-61, Ser-75, and Thr-87) has been also reported (20Adam-Stitah S. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18932-18941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that liganded RARγ2 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway when heterodimerized with RXRα and engaged in transcription of RA target genes (12Gianni M. Bauer A. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3760-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) according to the following model. The fraction of RARγ2 that is bound to cognate response elements as heterodimers with RXRα is phosphorylated by the cdk7 subunit of transcription factor IIH and activates transcription, which increases up to 24–48 h and then reaches a plateau. This restriction in transcription is concomitant to the RA-induced activity of p38MAPK, which leads to further phosphorylation of the AF-1 domain of RARγ2. This marked increase in phosphorylation acts as a permissive signal, paving the way to RARγ2 degradation through an increase in its ubiquitylation and subsequent recognition by the proteasomal SUG-1 subunit bound at helix 12. Liganded RXRα is also degraded by the proteasome pathway (21Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de The H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 22Osburn D.L. Shao G. Seidel H.M. Schulman I.G. Mol. Cell.

Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but whether this process is controlled by its AF-1 domain and/or its phosphorylation remains unknown. Most interestingly, both phosphorylation and the ubiquitinproteasome machineries also play a role in RARγ-mediated transcription. Therefore, we postulated that phosphorylation of the AF-1 domain would play a dual role, programming on the one hand the transcriptional pattern and on the other hand the receptor degradation, to prevent a single RARγ/RXRα heterodimer from performing endless rounds of transcription of the cognate RA target genes and therefore controlling the magnitude of transcription. In the present study, we have investigated how, within RARγ2/RXRα heterodimers, the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of each receptor regulate, in addition to their transcriptional properties, their own degradation and that of the partner. We show that the AF-2 domains of each receptor are crucial for their autonomous degradation. The phosphorylated AF-1 domain of RARγ2 is a fundamental determinant of the degradation and the transactivation of both partners. Unexpectedly, deletion of the whole AF-1 domain does not impair these processes but targets RARγ2 and its dimerization partner RXRα toward different mechanisms of regulation. We also show that the AF-1 of RXRα can be phosphorylated in response to RA. This phosphorylation has only a modulatory effect on the degradation of RXRα and its cooperation with RARγ2 for transcription.

Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the F region of RARγ, RPγ(F), have been described previously (26Ghyselinck N.B. Dupe V. Dierich A. Messaddeq N. Garnier J.M. Rochette-Egly C. Chambon P.

The synthetic retinoids BMS961 and BMS649 were a gift from Bristol-Myers Squibb. Cell Lines, Transfections, and CAT Assays—F9 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium under 7% CO2 with a change of medium every 48 h, as described (28Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R.

F9 cells ablated for RXRα (RXRα–/– cells) and F9 cells reexpressing RARγΔAF-1 in a RARγ-null background (RARγΔAF-1 rescue line) were described previously (29Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D.

COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, plated in 6-well plates, and transiently transfected using the DMRIE-C reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). All transient transfections were carried out in OPTIMEM (Invitrogen) and contained the DR5-tk-CAT reporter gene (1 μg/well), the pSG5-based expression vectors for mRARγ2 and mRXRα (0.05 μg of each/well), Bluescript as a carrier, and the β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (0.5 μg/well) to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. After a 16-h incubation with the DNA, the cells were washed and incubated for a further 48 h in medium in the absence or presence of RA (10–6m), the RARγ agonist (BMS961, 10–7m), the pan-RXR agonist (BMS649, 10–6m), or the combination of both agonists. CAT assays were performed using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method (CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Roche Applied Science). All assays were normalized to equal β-galactosidase activity, and the results were expressed as pg of CAT/unit of β-galactosidase. Extracts and Immunoblotting—Whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared from F9 cells or transfected COS-1 cells as described previously (31Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P.

The protein-antibody complexes were detected by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Isolation and Real-time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNAs were isolated using the guanidinium thiocyanate method, and aliquots (500 ng) were subjected to real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR by using the SYBR Green Light cycler detection system (Roche Applied Science and Idaho Technologies). Transcript levels were normalized according to 36B4 transcripts, which are unresponsive to retinoids. The oligonucleotides for 36B4, HNF3α, and HNF1β and were as described (12Gianni M. Bauer A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6452-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The AF-1 and AF-2 Domains of RARγ2 Control the Degradation of RARγ2/RXRα Heterodimers—To investigate how the activation functions of RARγ2 influence the degradation of both partners within RARγ2/RXRα heterodimers, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with a RARγ2 expression vector and a CAT reporter gene controlled by a DR5 RA-responsive element (DR5-tk-CAT) in the presence or absence of an RXRα expression vector and treated with RA. When concomitantly overexpressed, RARγ2 and RXRα bound as RARγ2/RXRα heterodimers to the DNA-response element, and RA treatment resulted in the degradation of RARγ2 that was maximal at 48 h (12Gianni M. Bauer A. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3760-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A, lane 2). However, in the absence of overexpressed RXRα, RARγ2WT was degraded less efficiently (Fig. 2A, lane 4), confirming that RXRα modulates RARγ2 degradation and indicating that endogenous RXRα is present in limited amounts in COS-1 cells. The degradation of RARγ2WT was reversed by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 2A, lane 8) but less by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2A, lane 10). Consistent with our previous results (12Gianni M. Bauer A. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3760-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21Kopf E. Plassat J.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), RARγ2 deleted for helix 12 (RARγ2ΔH12) and RARγ2 mutated at the phosphorylation sites located in the AF-1 domain (RARγ2S66/68A) were refractory to RA-induced degradation, regardless of the presence of overexpressed RXRα (Fig. 2B). Unexpectedly, we found that RARγ2 deleted for its N-terminal AF-1 domain (RARγΔAF-1) was significantly degraded when cotransfected with RXRα (Fig. 2C, lane 2). However, RARγΔAF-1 was resistant to RA-induced degradation when overexpressed in the absence of RXRα (Fig. 2C, lane 6) or when cotransfected with RXRα mutated at its dimerization surface (mRXRαD364A/E384A/E399A/Y402A/E406A/R426A/E439A) (RXRαΔHet) (21Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de The H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C, lane 4). This is different from what was observed with the other RAR isotype, RARα, which does not require the phosphorylation sites located in the AF-1 domain for degradation (21Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de The H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Indeed, RARαΔAF-1 and RARα mutated at the phosphorylation sites (RARαS77A) were degraded as efficiently as RARαWT, regardless of RXRα overexpression (data not shown). The degradation of RARγΔAF-1 was neither reversed by MG132 (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 2 and 4) nor reversed by z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2D, lane 6), suggesting that deletion of the AF-1 domain targets RARγ2 toward a proteolytic pathway that is distinct from those controlled by the proteasome or by caspases. In transfected COS cells, RXRα was also degraded at 48 h of RA treatment, whether its heterodimerization partner, RARγ2, was WT (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4), ΔAF-2 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4), or ΔAF-1 (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 2). The only exception was when RXRα heterodimerized with RARγ2S66/68A (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–8). The degradation of RXRα was reversed by MG132 in the context of heterodimers with RARγ2WT (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 6 and 8) but not with RARγΔAF-1 (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 2 and 4). However, in both cases, z-VAD-fmk promoted the accumulation of RXRα, indicating that the turnover of RXRα is sensitive to caspases (Fig. 2, A (lanes 9 and 10) and D (lanes 5 and 6)). Similar results were obtained in F9 embryocarcinoma cells with the endogenous RARγ2 and RXRα receptors. Indeed, in these cells, the degradation of RARγ2 that occurs at 48 h of RA treatment (12Gianni M. Bauer A. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3760-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de The H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2) required the presence of RXRα as RXRα–/– F9 cells did not show any evidence of RARγ2 degradation (Fig. 3A, lanes 9 and 10). In agreement with the results obtained with transfected COS-1 cells, RARγΔAF-1 expressed in RARγ-null cells (i.e. in the presence of RXRα) was degraded in response to RA (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). This degradation was neither reversed by MG132 (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 6 and 8) nor reversed by z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 3B, lanes 6 and 8). However, degradation did not occur when RARγΔAF-1 was expressed in the double knock-out RARγ–/–/RXRα–/– cells (Fig. 3A, lanes 11 and 12). The Degradation of RARγΔAF-1 Involves the AF-2 Domain of RXRα—To gain insight into the mechanisms through which RXRα participates in the degradation of RARγ2, either WT or deleted of its AF-1 domain, synthetic agonistic ligands specific for RARγ (BMS961) or RXRs (BMS649) were tested. The consequences of deleting the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of RXRα (in the RXRαΔAF-1 and RXRαΔH12 mutants respectively) were also tested. When dimerized with RXRαWT, RARγ2WT was degraded in response to its cognate ligand (Fig. 4A, lane 3) but not in response to the pan-RXR agonist (Fig. 4A, lane 4). The combination of the two ligands was as efficient as the RARγ agonist alone in inducing RARγ2 degradation (Fig. 4A, lane 5). Deletion of the AF-1 or AF-2 domains of RXRα, in RXRΔAF-1 and RXRαΔAF-2, respectively, did not affect this process (Fig. 4A, lanes 6–15). Similarly, RARγΔAF-1 underwent degradation upon binding of its cognate ligand (Fig. 4B, lane 3) but not in response to the pan-RXR agonist (Fig. 4B, lane 4). Deletion of the AF-1 domain of RXRα had no influence (Fig. 4B, lanes 6–10). However, deleting the AF-2 domain of RXRα made the RARγ ligand unable to signal degradation (Fig. 4B, lane 13), indicating that the helix 12 of RXRα may be of functional importance for the proteolysis of liganded RARγΔAF-1. However, the absence of this domain could be compensated either partially or totally upon addition of the two agonists (Fig. 4B, lane 15) or of RA (Fig. 4B, lane 12), respectively. Thus, one can hypothesize that the two agonists, as well as RA and its 9-cis metabolite, cooperate for inducing allosteric transconformation changes (7Egea P.F. Rochel N. Birck C. Vachette P. Timmins P.A. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 557-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) that would overcome the absence of the AF-2 domain of RXRα. The Autonomous Degradation of RXRα Requires, in Addition to Its AF-2 Domain, the AF-1 Domains of Both Partners—The degradation of RXRα heterodimerized with RARγ2, either WT or ΔAF-1, was also considered. When paired with RARγ2WT, RXRαWT was also degraded in response to its specific ligand, a pan-RXR agonist (Fig. 4A, lane 4), and not in response to the RARγ agonist (Fig. 4A, lane 3). The combination of the two agonists did not influence the degrading activity of the RXR agonist (Fig. 4A, lane 5). Thus, RXRαWT can be autonomously degraded. Accordingly, RXRα degradation still occurred upon deletion of helix 12 in the RARγ2 partner (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2) or in the absence of RARγ2 overexpression (21Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de The H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The pan-RXR agonist-induced degradation of RXRα was abrogated upon deletion of the AF-2 domain (Fig. 4A, lane 14), confirming that helix 12 is as crucial for the autonomous degradation of RXRα as for that of RARγ. However, in contrast to the same RARγ mutant, RXRαΔH2 was not totally resistant since its degradation could be triggered by the liganded RARγ partner (Fig. 4A, lanes 13 and 15). Deletion of the AF-1 domain also made RXRα refractory to its agonist-induced degradation (Fig. 4A, lane 9). Importantly, deletion of the AF-1 domain of the RARγ2 partner led to the same effect (Fig. 4B, lane 4), indicating that the autonomous degradation of RXRα is regulated through mechanisms involving the AF-1 domains of both partners. However, in both cases, the resistance was overcome upon addition of the two agonists (Fig. 4, A (lane 10) and B (lane 5)) or of RA (Fig.4A(lane 7) and B (lane 2)). Phosphorylation of the AF-1 Domain Also Accounts for the Autonomous Degradation of RXRα—Because the AF-1 domain plays a crucial role in the degradation of RXRα and phosphorylation serving as a positive signal for the degradation of several proteins (32Mitsui A. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6054-6059Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3760-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 21Kopf E. Plassat J.L. Vivat V. de The H. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33280-33288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we investigated whether it was the same for RXRα. The AF-1 domain of RXRα can be phosphorylated by MAPKs at three residues (Ser-61, Thr-75, and Ser-87) located in the AF-1 domain (20Adam-Stitah S. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18932-18941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that either in transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–4) or in F9 WT cells (Fig. 5B), RA induces an upward shift in the electrophoretic mobility of the receptor. This shift, which appears within 2 h of RA treatment and disappears at 24 h, reflects the phosphorylation of the three residues located in the AF-1 domain (20Adam-Stitah S. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18932-18941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) as it is abrogated upon their mutation into alanine in the RXRαS61A/T75A/S87A mutant (RXRαm) (Fig. 5A, lanes 5–8). RXRα mutated at the phosphorylation sites was degraded after 48 h of RA treatment, as efficiently as RXRα WT (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 2 and 4 and lanes 6 and 8), indicating that phosphorylation is not required for signaling the degradation of RXRα within RARγ2/RXRα heterodimers. Mutation of the RXRα phosphorylation sites did not affect the degradation of the RARγ2 partner, either WT or ΔAF-1 (Fig. 5C, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). However, mutation of the phosphorylation sites made RXRα less efficiently degraded in response to its agonist (Fig. 5D, compare lanes 3 and 7), as did the deletion of the AF-1 domain. This could be overcome upon addition of the two agonists (Fig. 5D, lane 8). RARγΔAF-1 Heterodimerized with RXRα Is Transcriptionally Active—Because RARγ2 degradation and transactivation are intimately linked (12Gianni M. Bauer A. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3760-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Gianni M. Kopf E. Bastien J. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24859-24862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we compared the transcriptional activity of RARγ2WT and RARγΔAF-1. RARγ2/RXRα heterodimers bind to response elements located in the promoters of RA target genes, and upon ligand binding, they induce transcription. Accordingly, in COS-1 cells coexpressing RARγ2WT, RXRα, and a CAT reporter gene under the control of a DR5-RA-response element (DR5-tk-CAT), RA induces a 10-fold increase in CAT activity (Fig. 6A, lane 2). This induction was less efficient in the absence of overexpressed RXRα, in agreement with the known heterodimer requirement for activation of transcription (Fig. 6A, lane 1). In contrast, RARγ2S66/68A and RARγ2ΔH12 were inactive regardless of the presence of overexpressed RXRα (Fig. 6A, lanes 3–6), confirming that the transcriptional properties of RARγ2/RXRα heterodimers are strictly dependent on the integrity of the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of RARγ2. Importantly, RARγΔAF-1 cotransfected with RXRα was transcriptionally active (Fig. 6A, lane 8). However, RARγΔAF-1 was unable to activate transcription when cotransfected with RXRαΔHet (Fig. 6A, lane 9) or when overexpressed in the absence of RXRα (Fig. 6A, lane 7). All together, these results highlight the importance of the heterodimerization partner RXRα, not only for the degradation but also for the transactivation of RARγΔAF-1. Transactivation by RARγ2, either WT or ΔAF-1, was abrogated by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 6B, lanes 2 and 5), supporting the concept that the proteasome can also carry out non-proteolytic tasks and modulate transcription (36Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). In contrast, z-VAD-fmk increased transcription mediated by RARγ2, either WT or ΔAF-1 (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 6), in agreement with the accumulation of RXRα (Fig. 2, A and C). The above observations were recapitulated in F9 embryocarcinoma cells. In these cells, the transactivation of RA target genes such as HNF1β and HNF3α was maximal and reached a plateau at 48 h (Fig. 7, A and B, lane 1). In agreement with the results obtained with transfected COS-1 cells, the RA-induced expression of these genes was completely impaired in RXRα–/– cells (Fig. 7, A and B, lane 3) and in F9 cells expressing RARγΔAF1 in a double RXRα/RARγ-null background (Fig. 7, A and B, lane 4). However, it was only decreased in F9 cells expressing RARγΔAF-1 in a RARγ-null background (i.e. in the presence of endogenous RXRα) (Fig. 7, A and B, lane 2). As in transfected COS cells, MG132 abrogated the RA-induced expression of these RA target genes in F9 cells expressing either RARγ2WT or RARγΔAF1 (Fig. 7, A and B, lanes 1 and 2), whereas z-VAD-fmk increased transcription in both cell lines (Fig. 7, A and B, lanes 1 and 2). RARγ2 and RXRα Synergize for Transcription through the Phosphorylation of the AF-1 Domain of RXRα—The mechanisms through which the activation domains of each partner participate in the transactivation of RARγ2/RXRα heterodimers were further investigated by using the same strategy as that described for degradation. Within RARγ2WT/RXRαWT heterodimers, liganded RARγ2 is able to induce transcription, whereas RXRα is subordinated to RARγ (14Germain P. Iyer J. Zechel C. Gronemeyer H. Nature. 2002; 415: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Accordingly, RXRα cannot autonomously induce transcription in response to its cognate ligand (Fig. 8A, lane 1) but synergizes with liganded RARγ (Fig. 8A, lane 1). Therefore, deleting helix 12 impaired the ability of RXRα to synergize with RARγ2 (Fig. 8A, lane 3). Deletion of the AF-1 domain of RXRα also abrogated the synergy between RARγ and RXR ligands (Fig. 8A, lane 2). Interestingly, mutation of the three phosphorylation sites located in the AF-1 domain of RXRα had the same effect (Fig. 8B). In the context of RARγΔAF-1/RXRα heterodimers, transcription was still efficiently activated by the RARγ agonist. However, synergy with liganded RXRα was abrogated, indicating that the AF-1 domain of RARγ2 also accounts for this process (Fig. 8A, lane 4). It is noteworthy that the autonomous activity of RARγΔAF-1 was not affected upon deletion of the AF-1 domain of RXRα (Fig. 8A, lane 5) but was impaired subsequently to the deletion of the AF-2 domain of RXRα (Fig. 8A, lane 6), indicating that the helix 12 of the partner accounts for the transactivation of liganded RARγΔAF-1. However, some transcriptional activity of the RARγΔAF-1/RXRαΔH12 heterodimers could be detected in the presence of the two agonists or of RA (Fig. 8A, lane 6). Within RAR/RXR heterodimers (Fig. 9A), the AF-2 domain of each partner cooperates for the recruitment of multiprotein complexes that act in coordinated and/or combinatorial manner to decompact chromatin and direct RNA polymerase II and the general transcription factors to the promoter (10Dilworth F.J. Chambon P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3047-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 11McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). According to recent studies, the AF-1 domains would also recruit intermediary proteins (37Bommer M. Benecke A. Gronemeyer H. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37961-37966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of each partner are key elements that cooperate with one other for controlling not only their own transcriptional activity and degradation but also that of the partner. We also demonstrate that deletion of one AF within one partner renders each one dependent on the other, highlighting the complex cooperation mechanisms between the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of each receptor. The AF-2 Domain of RARγ2 but Not That of RXRα Is Strictly Required for the Degradation and Transactivation of RARγ2/RXRα Heterodimers—Within transcriptionally active RARγ2/RXRα heterodimers, both RARγ2 and RXRα are autonomously degraded in response to their cognate ligand, through their AF-2 domains. However, the role played by the AF-2 domain of each partner is different. Considering RARγ2 (Fig. 9B), the integrity of its AF-2 domain is strictly required for the degradation of the receptor, in accordance with our previous observation that the 26 S proteasome is recruited through this domain (12Gianni M. Bauer A. Garattini E. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3760-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, RARγ2 degradation is not influenced by the AF-2 domain of RXRα, excluding a cooperative role for the liganded partner in the recruitment of the degradation machinery. Thus, one can suggest that RXRα might rather influence RARγ2 degradation through promoting its binding to the cognate response elements (38Depoix C. Delmotte M.H. Formstecher P. Lefebvre P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9452-9459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast, RXRα deleted for this same domain was not refractory to degradation as it could be degraded in response to the ligand of its partner. The contribution of the AF-2 domains of RARγ2 and RXRα in the transcriptional properties of the heterodimers is also somehow different. Indeed, upon deletion of the AF-2 domain of RARγ2, transcription cannot be induced by RA or any agonist, either alone or in combination (Fig. 9B). In contrast, deletion of the AF-2 domain of the RXRα partner did not affect the autonomous activity of RARγ2 but impaired the synergy between the two receptors. These results confirm the model according to which, within RAR/RXR heterodimers, liganded RXR is subordinated to the liganded RAR partner for the dissociation of co-repressors and the recruitment of coactivators (14Germain P. Iyer J. Zechel C. Gronemeyer H. Nature. 2002; 415: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the AF-2 domain of RARγ2 plays an “indispensable” role as it promotes both transactivation and degradation, and its absence cannot be compensated by the AF-2 of the RXRα partner. In contrast, the AF-2 domain of RXRα instead appears to play a “permissive” role as it only cooperates with RARγ2 during transcription and can be substituted by the AF-2 of RARγ2 in the degradation process. Phosphorylation of the AF-1 Domain of RARγ2 Is Strictly Required for the Degradation and Transactivation of RARγ2/RXRα Heterodimers, whereas That of RXRα Plays Only a Cooperative Role—The AF-1 domain of RARγ2 is also crucial to the degradation process through its phosphorylation and ubiquitylation (12Gianni M.

Interestingly, when heterodimerized to this mutant, RXRα was also refractory to degradation, suggesting that the phosphorylated AF-1 of RARγ2 signals the degradation of both partners. The phosphorylated AF-1 domain also plays a crucial role in transcription (15Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P.

Our results also illuminate a role for the AF-1 domain of RXRα, through its phosphorylation, in the degradation and transactivation of the heterodimers. We observed that RXRα responds to RA through an increase in the phosphorylation of its AF-1 domain. However, the role of this phosphorylated AF-1 domain (Fig. 9D) differs from that of RARγ2 as it is not critical but rather influences its own degradation as well as its cooperation with its partner for transcription. First, mutation of the phosphorylation sites (similarly to the deletion of the AF-1 domain) did not influence the degradation of the RARγ2 partner. Further, it did not make RXRα refractory to degradation. However, RXRα degradation was no more autonomous and required the influence of its liganded partner. Thus, one can postulate that the phosphorylation sites located in the AF-1 domain of RXRα cooperate with RARγ for the recruitment and/or the action of the degradation machinery and that this action can be substituted by liganded RARγ2. Second, mutation of the RXRα phosphorylation sites did not affect the ability of RARγ2/RXRα heterodimers to transactivate RA target genes. However, it made RXRα unable to synergize with liganded RARγ2 for transcription, indicating that not only the AF-2 domain but also the phosphorylation sites located in the AF-1 domain of RXRα cooperate with RARγ for the recruitment of cofactors and maximal transcriptional activity. Deletion of the AF-1 Domain Does Not Make RARγ2 Refractory to RA-induced Degradation Transactivation but Renders It Dependent on RXRα—The novelty of this study is that unexpectedly, upon deletion of the whole AF-1 domain of RARγ2, the degradation and the transcriptional properties of the heterodimers were not abrogated but were regulated through different molecular mechanisms (Fig. 9E). First, RARγΔAF-1 required the AF-2 domain of RXRα to activate transcription and to be degraded in response to its cognate ligand. However, in the absence of this domain, both processes could occur in response to the combination of both the RARγ and RXR agonists, probably due to allosteric transconformations changes (7Egea P.F. Rochel N. Birck C. Vachette P. Timmins P.A. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 557-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In that context, the degradation of RXRα WT, ΔAF-1, or ΔAF-2 also required allosteric transconformations induced by the two liganded partners. Thus, deletion of the AF-1 domain renders RARγ2 dependent on its partner. Second, RARγΔAF-1 degradation did not involve the proteasome but involved other proteases that remain to be characterized. Thus, in contrast to the mutation of the RARγ2 phosphorylation sites that makes the heterodimers completely refractory to proteasomal degradation, deletion of the whole AF-1 domain shifts the receptors toward other proteolytic pathways through RXRα. Finally, RARγΔAF-1 was unable to synergize with liganded RXRα for transcription, indicating that not only the AF-2 domain but also the AF-1 domain of RARγ2 cooperates with RXRα for the recruitment of cofactors and maximal transcriptional activity. In conclusion, our results highlight the crucial role played by the phosphorylated AF-1 domain of RARγ2 in the autonomous degradation of each partner and their cooperation for transcription. As many cancers characterized by aberrant kinase activities (42Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Nature. 2001; 411: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar) are resistant to retinoids (43Tari A.M. Lim S.J. Hung M.C. Esteva F.J. Lopez-Berestein G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5224-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that the phosphorylation of RARs and/or RXRs is affected in these cells, leading to an aberrant degradation of the receptors and a deficient transcription of the RA target genes. To gain insight in the mechanisms regulating these processes, we are currently investigating which proteins are interacting with the AF-1 domains of RARγ2 and RXRα. We acknowledge J. Bastien and S.

https://openalex.org/W2028376971,"Transport, biological action, and clearance of leptin are subject to modulation by plasma components responsible for the formation of the so-called ""bound"" fraction of serum leptin. Candidates for modulators have been identified previously, but mechanisms for their action, and thus their physiological roles, have remained unclear. Here we have obtained evidence for a role of serum-borne clusterin in leptin biology and have delineated a possible mechanism for its action. We demonstrate complex formation between clusterin and leptin by several approaches and show that the binary complex retains the ability to transduce the leptin signal via binding to the leptin receptor and activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway. The interaction of leptin with clusterin does not require additional serum components. Furthermore, and importantly for modulation of the bioactivity of leptin, uptake of leptin present in the complex can be mediated by members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, i.e., apolipoprotein receptor type-2 and the very LDL receptor, which here are shown to efficiently endocytose both free and leptin-associated clusterin. Thus, bioavailability of leptin at a given tissue site may be determined by the levels of clusterin and/or by the relative distribution of certain relatives of the LDL receptor vis-à-vis active leptin receptors."

Like p53, p73 is activated in response to DNA-damaging insults to induce cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Under these conditions p73 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Abl, a prerequisite modification for p73 to elicit cell death in fibroblasts. In this study we report that in response to ionizing radiation, p73 undergoes nuclear redistribution and becomes associated with the nuclear matrix. This association is c-Abl-dependent because it was not observed in cells that are defective in c-Abl kinase activation. Moreover, STI-571, a specific c-Abl kinase inhibitor, is sufficient to block significantly p73α nuclear matrix association. The observed c-Abl dependence of nuclear matrix association was recapitulated in the heterologous baculovirus system.

Like p53, p73 can induce apoptosis in a variety of cell lines and support transcription of genes containing p53-response elements (1Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A.

However, the identity of the upstream effectors was not fully resolved. The c-Abl non-receptor tyrosine kinase was identified as an upstream effector of p73 both in vitro and in vivo (13Agami R.

The level of p73 tyrosine phosphorylation is elevated when cells are exposed to ionizing radiation, a condition whereby c-Abl kinase is activated. Furthermore, p73 and c-Abl are physically associated via the p73 PXXP motif and the c-Abl Src homology 3 domain (13Agami R. Blandino G. Oren M. Shaul Y.

A recent study showed that the induction of apoptosis by p53 requires the presence of p73 (17Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Crowley D. Sengupta S. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T. Nature. 2002; 416: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). However, p73 can induce apoptosis in the absence of p53 (15Irwin M.S. Kondo K. Marin M.C. Cheng L.S. Hahn W.C. Kaelin W.G. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). An interesting interplay between p73 and p53 mutants became recently evident. Several p53 mutants, in particular of the p53Arg-72 variant, are potent inhibitors of p73 function (15Irwin M.S. Kondo K. Marin M.C. Cheng L.S. Hahn W.C. Kaelin W.G.

Although an enzyme-substrate relationship between c-Abl and p73 has been established, it is still unclear how p73 modification by c-Abl influences p73 ability to induce apoptosis. It has been demonstrated that the p73 half-life is prolonged by treatment with the DNA-damaging agent cisplatin, and the accumulated p73 activates certain downstream targets to induce apoptosis (21Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). However, sole p73 accumulation might not be sufficient in this process. Recently, it has been reported that DNA damage induces p73 acetylation by the acetyltransferase p300, a modification that gives rise to selective transactivation of proapoptotic target genes (22Costanzo A. Merlo P. Pediconi N. Fulco M. Sartorelli V. Cole P.A. Fontemaggi G. Fanciulli M. Schiltz L. Blandino G. Balsano C. Levrero M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This process requires functional c-Abl, suggesting that p73 tyrosine phosphorylation may trigger the whole pathway. This is also the case in other p73 pathways. For example, p73 threonine phosphorylation by p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase requires functional c-Abl (23Sanchez-Prieto R. Sanchez-Arevalo V.J. Servitja J.M. Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 974-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It appears therefore that p73 tyrosine phosphorylation by c-Abl sensitizes p73 to undergo additional modifications. It is evident from the study of p53 that, in addition to protein modification and stabilization, subcellular localization plays a critical role in regulation of p53 function (24Jimenez G.S. Khan S.H. Stommel J.M. Wahl G.M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7656-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 25Vousden K.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Cell. 2003; 112: 29-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Little is known about p73 subcellular localization, but it appears that this may play an important role in p73 function as well. Both p73 and c-Abl colocalize in the cytoplasm of spermatogonia and spermatocytes suggesting a tissue-specific regulation of these proteins by the mechanism of subcellular localization (27Hamer G. Gademan I.S. Kal H.B. de Rooij D.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4298-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Yes-associated protein is a p73 transcriptional coactivator (28Strano S. Munarriz E.

It has been reported recently (29Basu S. Totty N.F. Irwin M.S. Sudol M. Downward J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 11-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar) that cytoplasmic sequestration of Yes-associated protein reduces p73-mediated induction of Bax expression and p73-mediated apoptosis, following DNA damage. However, the possibility that under this condition p73 translocates to the cytoplasm was not investigated. Finally, HIPK2, a homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2, has been found to bind to p73 (30Kim E.J. Park J.S. Um S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32020-32028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). HIPK2 is a member of a novel family of nuclear serine/threonine kinases previously found to bind and activate p53 (31Wang Y. Debatin K.M. Hug H. BMC Mol.

Coen S. Marchetti A. Del Sal G. Piaggio G. Fanciulli M. Appella E. Soddu S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). HIPK2 localizes with p53 and PML-3 in the nuclear bodies (also named promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies). Interestingly, similar to p53, p73 colocalizes with HIPK2 in PML. These data define functional interaction between p73 and HIPK2 that results in the targeted subcellular localization of p73. In this study we followed p73 cellular distribution under conditions whereby p73 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by c-Abl. We provide evidence for p73α translocation to the nuclear matrix fraction in a c-Abl-dependent manner. This process requires a functional c-Abl kinase domain. Interference with c-Abl kinase activity either by using c-Abl kinase-incompetent cells or STI-571, a c-Abl kinase pharmacological inhibitor, disrupts p73α nuclear matrix association. Finally, we utilized the insect cells to overexpress p73 and c-Abl. Under these conditions p73α is efficiently tyrosine-phosphorylated with its concomitant translocation to the nuclear matrix fraction. These data provide evidence for a novel mechanism of p73 regulation. Cell Cultures and Baculovirus Infection—Human colon carcinoma lines HCT116, HCT116-3(6) (34Boyer J.C. Umar A. Risinger J.I.

Expression of c-Abl and p73 in insect cells was performed as described in the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system manual (Invitrogen). c-Abl cDNA (nucleotides 1–4113) was ligated into the BamHI-StuI sites of the pFASTBAC HTb expression vector encoding an N-terminal histidine tag. Simian p73 cDNA (nucleotides 1–1887) was introduced into the BamHI-HindIII sites of pFASTBAC HTc also encoding a histidine tag. Bacmid DNA corresponding to each plasmid was transfected into H5 insect cells, and the viruses were amplified for three additional times. The p53 baculovirus was kindly provided by Dr. V. Rotter.

STI-571 was kindly provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals. IR was done with Co60 source. Antiserum to simian p73 was raised in rabbits immunized with bacterially produced, SDS-PAGE-purified p73 (amino acids 1–667). PY99 antibodies were raised in rabbits immunized with phosphorylated peptide (CVPTHSPY(PO3H2)AQP-NH2). Rabbit antiserum was further purified on a protein-A/G column. The phosphorylated antibody was characterized, and it recognizes specifically phosphorylated p73 at tyrosine 99 (data not shown). Antibody 1801, a p53 monoclonal antibody (35Banks L. Matlashewski G.

Protein Extraction and Immunoprecipitation—Forty eight hours post-infection, H5 insect cells were collected and resuspended in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 0.5% deoxycholate (v/v), 0.1% SDS (v/v), 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and 1 mm PMSF (Sigma mixture)). Insoluble pellets were discarded, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubation of the extract with protein-A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 5 μg of anti-Tyr(P), anti-c-Abl, or anti-p73 (H79) for 4 h at 4 °C. Next the beads were washed five times with RIPA buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblotting of the proteins was performed using the indicated antibodies. For the CIP treatment, 2 units of CIP were added to cell lysates and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding Laemmli sample buffer. Nuclear Matrix Fractionation—Nuclear matrix fractionation was performed as described (36Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were seeded at a density adjusted to reach 70% confluency at the end of the experiment. Cells were washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell pellet was resuspended in three packed cell volumes of cytoskeleton buffer (CSK) (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and 1 mm PMSF (Sigma mixture)). After 5 min at 4 °C, the cytoskeletal framework was separated from soluble proteins by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 3 min. Chromatin was digested with 1 mg/ml DNase I in 2 volumes of CSK buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. Then ammonium sulfate was added from a 1 m stock solution in CSK buffer to a final concentration of 0.25 m and after 5 min at 4 °C and spun down. The pellet was further extracted with 2 m NaCl in CSK buffer for 5 min at 4 °C and centrifuged. This treatment removed the entire DNA and histones from the nucleus. The remaining pellet was solubilized in urea buffer (8 m urea, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, and 0.01 m Tris, pH 8), and regarded as the nuclear matrix containing fraction. Chromatin Fractionation—Chromatin fractionation was performed as described (37Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). In brief, for chromatin isolation, cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and 1 mm PMSF (Sigma mixture)). Triton X-100 (0.1%) was added, and the cells were incubated for 5 min on ice. Nuclei were collected by low speed centrifugation (4 min for 1,300 × g). The supernatant was further clarified by high speed centrifugation (10 min for 20,000 × g) to remove cell debris and insoluble aggregates. Nuclei were washed once in buffer A and then lysed in buffer B (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitors as described above). Insoluble chromatin was collected by centrifugation (4 min for 1,700 × g), washed once in buffer B, and centrifuged again under the same conditions. The final chromatin pellet was resuspended in Laemmli buffer and sonicated for 15 s. To release chromatin-bound proteins by nuclease treatment, cell nuclei were resuspended in buffer A plus 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 units of micrococcal nuclease. After incubation for 5 min at 37 °C, the nuclease reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 mm EGTA. Nuclei were collected by low speed centrifugation and lysed according to the chromatin isolation protocol described above. Cell Cycle Analysis—For fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis cells were harvested 2–40 h post-IR, washed twice with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol. After fixation, the cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 50 μg/ml RNase A and 25 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS. In each assay 10,000 cells were collected by FACScan and analyzed with the Cellquest program (BD Biosciences). p73α Associates with the Nuclear Matrix in Irradiated Cells—Protein post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and sumoylation regulate protein spatial compartmentalization (38Mancini M.A. Shan B.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2587-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of IR and cisplatin on p73 nuclear redistribution, we employed the high salt nuclear matrix extraction procedure to separate the various nuclear fractions (36Reyes J.C. Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). First, soluble proteins were extracted using non-ionic detergent (fraction I) followed by DNase I digestion and ammonium sulfate precipitation of the chromatin associated proteins (fraction II). Fraction III was obtained by washing the pellet with 2 m NaCl. The remaining pellet was solubilized in 8 m urea to obtain fraction IV which is contained with the structural nuclear matrix and the associated proteins (Fig. 1A) (41Hakes D.J. Berezney R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11131-11140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The obtained fractions were SDS-PAGE separated and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. In the non-treated COS-1 cells p73α is detected predominantly in the nucleocytoplasm fraction (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, following exposure to IR, a significant increase in p73 level was detected in the nuclear matrix fraction (fraction IV). The effectiveness of the fractionation protocol was verified by specific detection of the lamin B nuclear matrix protein in this fraction. In COS-1 cells cisplatin did not increase p73 levels, and no nuclear matrix accumulation was observed. As a control we monitored the level of p53 in the obtained fractions. Notably, under these conditions the amount of p53 remained unchanged in response to IR and only slightly increased upon cisplatin treatment. The poor p53 accumulation is possibly due to the effect of the SV40 large T antigen that is constitutively expressed in these cells. In addition, p53 unlike p73α did not translocate to the nuclear matrix fraction. These data suggest that in response to IR, p73α selectively translocates to the nuclear matrix. p73α Association with the Nuclear Matrix Depends on c-Abl Kinase Activation—Activation of c-Abl and p73 by cisplatin requires a functional MLH1 gene as well as c-Abl activation (21Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The mismatch-repair-defective human cell line HCT116 lacks the MLH1 gene on chromosome 3, whereas the matched HCT116-3(6) cells have acquired the functional MLH1 gene by transfer of chromosome 3 (34Boyer J.C. Umar A. Risinger J.I. Lipford J.R. Kane M. Yin S. Barrett J.C. Kolodner R.D. Kunkel T.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6063-6070PubMed Google Scholar). The acquisition of MLH1 gene has recovered c-Abl kinase activation by cisplatin. We have confirmed this finding and found that this is not specific to cisplatin-treated cells but also true for irradiated cells (data not shown). These paired cell lines were used to test the possible role of c-Abl kinase activity in p73 nuclear redistribution following IR exposure and cisplatin treatment. In non-treated HCT116 and HCT116-3(6) cells, p73α is equally distributed in the nucleocytoplasm, chromatin, and nuclear matrix fractions (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, 40 h following IR, p73α was translocated to the nuclear matrix fraction only in the kinase-competent c-Abl HCT116-3(6) cells but not in the matched HCT116 cell line (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 8). In contrast, cisplatin treatment caused p73 accumulation, in agreement with a previous report (21Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), but not nuclear matrix association. The level of p53 was induced in both cell lines upon IR and cisplatin treatment, suggesting that p53 stabilization is likely to be c-Abl kinase-independent. Here again, no significant p53 nuclear redistribution was obtained. These results hint at the possibility that the selective p73α translocation from the nucleocytoplasm to the nuclear matrix fraction is c-Abl kinase-dependent. To substantiate the finding that p73α associates with the nuclear matrix and to rule out the possibility that this is the direct outcome of the high salt extraction procedure, we used an alternative chromatin fractionation protocol (37Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). In this procedure, cells are lysed with non-ionic detergent in a sucrose-rich buffer, and nuclei are then collected by low speed centrifugation, washed, and lysed in no salt buffer. A second centrifugation step separates the remaining soluble nuclear proteins from the insoluble fraction that contains proteins bound to chromatin or to the nuclear matrix. To distinguish between the chromatin and the nuclear matrix-bound proteins, micrococcal nuclease treatment was employed to release the chromatin fraction (Fig. 2B). In the untreated HCT116-3(6) cells, p73α is predominantly found in the fraction containing the soluble proteins (Fig. 2C, lane 1) with a minute amount in the soluble nuclear protein fraction (lanes 2 and 3) but not in the chromatin fraction. Upon IR treatment, the p73α level in the soluble protein fraction decreased with concomitant accumulation in the chromatin and nuclear matrix fractions. Because p73α was not solubilized after micrococcal nuclease treatment, we concluded that p73α is preferentially associated with the nuclear matrix and not with the chromatin fraction. In contrast to p73, p53 was accumulated upon IR treatment in the chromatin but not the nuclear matrix fraction, because it was solubilized almost completely by micrococcal nuclease (Fig. 2C, lower panel, lanes 4 and 5). These data indicate that in response to IR, p73α, but not p53, translocates from soluble nuclear fraction to the nuclear matrix. Inhibition of c-Abl Kinase Activity Blocks p73α Association with the Nuclear Matrix—To substantiate the role of c-Abl kinase in p73α nuclear matrix translocation, we used the c-Abl kinase inhibitor STI-571 (42Druker B.J. Tamura S. Buchdunger E. Ohno S. Segal G.M. Fanning S. Zimmermann J. Lydon N.B. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 561-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (3167) Google Scholar, 43Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1630) Google Scholar). The proficient c-Abl HCT116-3(6) cells were irradiated in the presence or absence of STI-571, and nuclear fractions were analyzed. Here again, irradiation of HCT116-3(6) cells triggered p73α association with nuclear matrix (Fig. 3, lane 3). Interestingly, no p73α accumulation in the nuclear matrix fraction was evident when c-Abl kinase activity was inhibited by STI-571 (lane 4). The proficiency of the fractionation protocol was confirmed by using anti-lamin B antibody, a nuclear matrix protein. This finding indicates that in response to IR c-Abl kinase regulates p73α association with the nuclear matrix. p73α Nuclear Redistribution Is a Slow, Gradual, and IR Dose-dependent Process—By having demonstrated that in response to IR, p73α becomes associated with the nuclear matrix in a c-Abl kinase-dependent manner, we next measured IR dose response and time kinetics of this process. For IR dose response the paired HCT cells were u"

The vertebrate enzymes are α2β2 tetramers in which protein-disulfide isomerase serves as the β subunit. Two isoforms of the catalytic α subunit have been identified and shown to form [α(I)]2β2 and [α(II)]2β2 tetramers, the type I and type II C-P4Hs, respectively. The peptide-substrate-binding domain of type I C-P4H has been shown to be located between residues 138 and 244 in the 517-residue α(I) subunit and to be distinct from the catalytic domain that is located in the C-terminal region. We report here that a recombinant human C-P4H α(I) polypeptide Phe144-Ser244 forms a folded domain consisting of five α helices and one short β strand. This structure is quite different from those of other proline-rich peptide-binding modules, which consist mainly of β strands. Binding of the peptide (Pro-Pro-Gly)2 to this domain caused major chemical shifts in many backbone amide resonances, the residues showing the largest shifts being mainly hydrophobic, including three tyrosines. The Kd values determined by surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry for the binding of several synthetic peptides to the α(I) and the corresponding α(II) domain were very similar to the Km and Ki values for these peptides as substrates and inhibitors of the type I and type II C-P4H tetramers. The Kd values of the α(I) and α(II) domains for (Gly-Pro-4Hyp)5 were much higher than those for (Pro-Pro-Gly)5, indicating a marked decrease in the affinity of hydroxylated peptides for the domain.

Two P4H families are known today. The collagen P4Hs (C-P4Hs), enzymes residing within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, have a central role in the synthesis of all collagens, the resulting 4-hydroxyproline residues being essential for assembly of the triple-helical molecules (1Kivirikko K.I.

In hypoxia this hydroxylation ceases, HIF-α forms a dimer with HIF-β, and the dimer then becomes bound to the HIF-responsive elements in a number of hypoxia-inducible genes.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The presence of a glutamate and glutamine in the peptide-substrate-binding domain of the α(II) subunit in the positions corresponding to Ile182 and Tyr233 in the α(I) subunit was found to explain most of these differences (17Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We report here on NMR data indicating that a recombinant human C-P4H α(I) subunit polypeptide Phe144-Ser244 forms a folded domain consisting of five α helices and one short β strand, its secondary structure being distinct from those of other proline-rich peptide-binding modules. Binding of a peptide substrate to this domain was found to cause significant shifts in many backbone amide resonances. The Kd values of this domain and the corresponding α(II) subunit domain for peptide substrates and inhibitors were similar to the Km and Ki values of these peptides for the type I and type II enzyme tetramers, suggesting that this domain plays a critical role in the binding of peptide substrates to the enzyme. Protein Expression and Purification—The recombinant human α(I) Phe144-Ser244 polypeptide was prepared by amplifying a cDNA fragment encoding residues Phe144-Ser244 with an NdeI site and a translation start codon preceding the codon for Phe144 and an XhoI site following the codon for Ser244, using Pfu polymerase (Promega). The template was pET15b-α(I) Gly138-Ser244 (17Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in which the codon for Cys150 (TGC) was converted to that for serine (TCC). The C150S mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The recombinant human α(II) Met142-Ser242 polypeptide was prepared by amplifying a cDNA fragment encoding residues Met142-Ser242 with an NdeI site preceding the codon for Met142 and an XhoI site following the codon for Ser242, using full-length human C-P4H α(II) cDNA (11Annunen P.

The codon for Cys148 (TGC) was converted to that for serine (TCC) in the same PCR amplification step. The PCR products were cloned into NdeI-XhoI-digested pET-22b expression vectors (Novagen) in-frame with the sequence encoding a C-terminal histidine tag and transformed into the BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli host strain (Novagen). For expression, 500 ml of Luria-Bertoni medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) was inoculated with 5 ml of overnight culture. When A 600 reached 0.8, synthesis of the recombinant proteins was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 4 h at 30 °C, after which the cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication. The soluble proteins were applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Bis-Tris and 0.1 m glycine, pH 6.8. The bound proteins were eluted with a 200-ml linear imidazole gradient (0–0.5 m), and the fractions were analyzed by 16.5% Tris-tricine PAGE. The fractions containing the recombinant polypeptide were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a SuperDex 75 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and fractions were analyzed by 16.5% Tris-tricine PAGE. Those containing the pure 13-kDa recombinant protein were pooled, and all experiments were performed with polypeptides containing their histidine tag. Poly(l-proline) binding of the recombinant domains was tested as described previously (17Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The 15N- and 15N,13C-labeled proteins were expressed in the Bio-Express cell growth media U-15N and U-13C,15N (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories), respectively. Limited proteolysis of the purified recombinant α(I) domain was performed with trypsin, and the N termini were sequenced as described (17Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The M r values of the trypsin resistant fragments were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Voyager DE-STR, Applied Biosystems). Peptides—The peptides (Pro-Pro-Gly)2 and (Gly-Pro-4Hyp)5 were purchased from Innovagen, (Pro-Pro-Gly)5 and (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 from the Peptide Institute, and poly(l-proline) from Sigma. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy (CD)—CD spectra were recorded with a JASCO J-715 CD-spectropolarimeter, the sample cell temperature being controlled by JASCO PFD-350S. Far-UV spectra were measured using a 1-mm path-length cell for the 185–240 nm region. The step size was 0.2 nm, scan speed 20 nm/min, response 1 s, bandwidth 1 nm, and number of accumulations 4/spectrum. Thermal denaturation of the peptide-binding domain was followed by continuous monitoring of ellipticity changes at a fixed wavelength of 222 nm while the sample was heated at a constant rate of 30 °C/h and renaturation was followed by cooling at the same rate. The protein concentration in the samples was 0.1 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, or in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer and 100 mm urea. NMR Spectroscopy—The samples used for the NMR measurements were prepared at concentrations of 0.35–1 mm in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, dissolved in 90/10% H2O/D2O at pH 6.8, and urea was added at a final concentration of 100 mm to 15N,13C-labeled samples. To establish the sequential assignment, gradient-selected sensitivity-enhanced HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCANH, and CBCA(CO)NH (24Ikura M.J. Kay E.L. Bax A.

Reson. 1994; 109A: 129-133Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar) spectra were collected at 15 °C on Varian Unity INOVA 600 and 800 MHz NMR spectrometers. All the spectra were processed using the VNMR6.1 software package (Vnmr 6.1b, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The number of data points on the 13C and 15N dimensions was doubled by forward linear prediction before a Fourier transform. Sparky 3.100 (30Goddard, T. D., and Kneller, D. G., SPARKY 3, University of California, San FranciscoGoogle Scholar) was used for spectral assignment and analysis. Titration of the peptide-binding domain with a synthetic (Pro-Pro-Gly)2 peptide was performed by adding known amounts of concentrated peptide stock solutions to the 15N-labeled peptide-binding domain (using peptide to domain concentration ratios of 0:1, 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 5:1, 10:1, and 20:1) and recording a two-dimensional, gradient-selected sensitivity-enhanced 15N-1H HSQC (31Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2433) Google Scholar) spectrum after each addition. The perturbations in the chemical shifts were calculated using the following equation. Δppm=[(ΔHN)2+(ΔN)2](Eq. 1) Dissociation constants (Kd) for binding were determined, assuming 1:1 binding stoichiometry, from the concentration dependence of the weighted chemical shift changes in which the observed chemical shift change (Δδobs) is Δδobs=Δδmax(C/Cpbd)(Eq. 2) where Δδmax is the chemical shift difference between the bound and free peptide-binding domains, C pbd is the total concentration of the peptide-binding domain, and C is the concentration of bound peptide-binding domain, which is given by the equation, C=0.5[(Kd+Cpbd+Cpep)-(Kd+Cpbd+Cpep)2-4CpbdCpep](Eq. 3) where C pep is the total concentration of the (Pro-Pro-Gly)2 peptide. The chemical shift changes in the seven most affected residues were used to calculate Kd by minimization of the goodness-of-fit parameter (32Clubb R.T. Omichinski J.G. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), as shown in the equation, χ2=Σ(Δδtheory-Δδobs)2(Eq. 4) when both Kd and Δδmax were varied (see Fig. 5B) Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—Surface plasmon resonance assays were performed with a BIAcore® 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The peptide-binding domains were immobilized covalently on a hydrophilic carboxymethylated dextran matrix (CM5 sensor chip, Biacore AB) with standard amine coupling chemistry (33Göhring W. Sasaki T. Heldin C.H. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) at pH 5.0 at a level of about 1500 resonance units. Binding analyses were carried out in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, containing 0.05% P-20 surfactant (Biacore AB) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. Injection times were 4 min followed by 8 min of dissociation. The bulk effects were subtracted using reference surfaces. The chips were regenerated with 10-s injections of 10 mm glycine, pH 2.0. The steady state binding value, R eq, for each peptide analyte concentration was plotted as a function of total analyte concentration. To derive binding constants, data from these plots were analyzed by means of the steady state affinity-binding model provided in the BIAevaluation software version 3.1. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC experiments were performed using a VP-ITC titration microcalorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA). In the individual titrations, 5-μl doses of peptide solutions in 2.5–10 mm concentrations (in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8) were injected into a sample cell (volume 1.4476 ml) containing 0.25–0.5 mm of the peptide-binding domain in the above buffer at an interval of 4 min with stirring at 300 rpm. The titration data obtained were corrected by subtracting the heat of dilution of the peptides from the raw data and fitted by the non-linear least squares minimization method using one set of sites model (Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm) to determine the dissociation constant (Kd), binding stoichiometry (n), and change in enthalpy (ΔH) using the Origin software (Microcal). Other Assays—P4H activity was assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (34Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), and Km values were determined as described previously (16Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Optimization of the Recombinant α(I) Polypeptide—Initial experiments were performed using a purified recombinant human C-P4H α(I) subunit polypeptide Gly138-Ser244 (17Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in which the only cysteine (Cys150) was mutated to serine. The quality of the NMR spectra obtained with this 15N-labeled polypeptide was not satisfactory, however, and therefore further experiments were performed with recombinant polypeptides lacking a few residues from the N- or C-terminal end (details not shown). A Phe144-Ser244 polypeptide was found to give the best spectra and was therefore used for all the experiments reported here. It was purified to homogeneity based on its histidine tag. Limited proteolysis experiments of this purified domain with trypsin (17Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) demonstrated that it is protease-resistant, except that a minor cleavage product was identified by SDS-PAGE. N-terminal sequencing showed that the major and minor bands had intact N termini. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the minor product corresponded to a polypeptide that had lost its C-terminal serine and the histidine tag (details not shown). CD Analysis of the α(I) Peptide-binding Domain—Far-UV CD experiments sensitive to protein secondary structure were performed to study the fold and thermal stability of the recombinant α(I) polypeptide. The CD spectra showed a typical pattern of α-helical proteins, with negative minima at 208 and 222 nm and a positive maximum at 193 nm (Fig. 1A). A thermal scan from 5 to 95 °C demonstrated that the recombinant polypeptide displays a continuous, gradual decrease in helical content (Fig. 1B) that is almost completely reversible (Fig. 1, A and B). The denaturation data indicate that the recombinant domain does not have a very compact tertiary structure and behaves more like proteins in a molten globule state. CD spectra were also recorded for a sample containing urea at the same concentration as used in NMR measurements, 100 mm. The shape of the far-UV curve remained unchanged, but a small increase in ellipticity was detected, indicating a slight increase in the compactness of the fold (Fig. 1C). The difference in the ellipticity between the native and thermally denatured proteins was likewise 20% greater in the urea sample than in the sample without urea (Fig. 1, B and D). NMR Assignments of the α(I) Peptide-binding Domain—Uniformly 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled samples of the α(I) peptide-binding domain were prepared for NMR studies, the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the 15N-labeled domain being shown in Fig. 2. The spectra of the 15N/13C double-labeled samples had broader lines and poorer dispersion than those of the 15N-labeled samples, but the quality of the spectra could be improved by adding 100 mm urea to the samples. All the spectra were acquired at 15 °C because of the low thermal stability of the domain revealed by the CD and preliminary NMR studies. Backbone assignments were obtained based on the intraresidual and sequential Cα/Cβ connectivities observed in the three-dimensional NMR experiments HNCA, HN(CO)CA, CBCANH, and CBCA(CO)NH with the exception of the first few N-terminal residues, part of the histidine tag in the C terminus, and the region between the residues Pro219 and Glu232, where assignments could not be obtained because of spectral overlapping. The Cα and Cβ chemical shift indices (35Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar) indicate that the α(I) peptide-binding domain is composed of five α helices and a short β strand, Ile182-Asp186, between the second and third helices (Fig. 3). The first four α helices consist of residues Glu148-Thr159, Tyr163-Asp178, Lys187-Gln200, and Leu204-Leu217 (Fig. 3), whereas the fifth is located in the C terminus of the domain, but its length could not be determined because of the missing assignments. Predictions based on the amino acid sequence (36Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest, however, that this helix may begin at His221. As the predicted locations and sizes of the other four α helices are in good agreement with the data obtained here, the N terminus of helix 5 is shown in Fig. 3 based on such predictions. All these data are in good agreement with the measured dipolar couplings (data not shown). NMR Studies of Peptide Binding—To obtain information on the interaction between the α(I) peptide-binding domain and peptide substrates, NMR was used to study binding of the synthetic peptide (Pro-Pro-Gly)2. Chemical shift changes in backbone amide 1H and 15N resonances were followed by means of 1H-15N-HSQC spectra as the peptide concentration was increased. Several resonances showed significant chemical shift perturbation as a result of the peptide binding (Figs. 4 and 5). The 15 residues showing the largest chemical shift changes were mainly hydrophobic, including 3 tyrosines (Tyr199, Tyr193, and Tyr196), there being only 1 charged residue among the 15 most affected ones (Fig. 5). 6 of the 15 residues with the largest chemical shift changes are located in α helix 3, 3 in helix 4, 2 in helix 1, 1 in helix 2, 1 in the loop between helices 1 and 2, and 1 in the short β strand. None of the 15 residues are located in helix 5, but even this helix had residues showing chemical shift changes exceeding 0.1 ppm, its 3 residues showing the highest chemical shifts being Ile234, Met235, and Tyr233 (Fig. 5A). The residues with chemical shift changes exceeding 0.25 ppm were selected for determination of the dissociation co"
https://openalex.org/W2010937653,"PMR1 is the yeast secretory pathway pump responsible for high affinity transport of Mn2+ and Ca2+ into the Golgi, where these ions are sequestered and effectively removed from the cytoplasm. Phenotypic growth assays allow for convenient screening of side chains important for Ca2+ and Mn2+ transport. Earlier we demonstrated that mutant Q783A at the cytoplasmic interface of M6 could transport Ca2+, but not Mn2+. Scanning mutagenesis of side chains proximal to residue Gln-783 in membrane helices M2, M4, M5, and M6 revealed additional residues near the cytoplasmic interface, notably Leu-341 (M5), Phe-738 (M5), and Leu-785 (M6) that are sensitive to substitution. Importantly, we obtained evidence for a packing interaction between Val-335 in M4 and Gln-783 in M6 that is critical for Mn2+ transport. Thus, mutant V335G mimics the Mn2+ transport defect of Q783A and mutant V335I can effectively suppress the Mn2+-defective phenotype of Q783A. These changes in ion selectivity were confirmed by cation-dependent ATP hydrolysis using purified enzyme. Other substitutions at these sites are tolerated individually, but not in combination. Exchange of side chains at 335 and 783 also results in ion selectivity defects, suggesting that the packing interaction may be conformation-sensitive. Homology models of M4, M5, and M6 of PMR1 have been generated, based on the structures of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase. The models are supported by data from mutagenesis and reveal that Gln-783 and Val-335 show conformation-sensitive packing at the cytoplasmic interface.

The Secretory Pathway Ca2+-ATPases (SPCAs) 1The abbreviations used are: SPCA, secretory pathway Ca2+-ATPase; SERCA, sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis; GFP, green fluorescent protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. are an emerging family of Mn2+- and Ca2+-transporting P-type ATPases localized to the Golgi apparatus (1Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. Missiaen L. Eur. J. Physiol. 2003; 446: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 2Ton V.-K. Mandal D. Vahadji C. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6422-6427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Members of this family have been identified in the genomes of diverse organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other yeasts (PMR1), Caenorhabditis elegans (PMR1), Drosophila melanogaster (Q9VNR2), and Homo sapiens (ATP2C1). S. cerevisiae PMR1 has distinct inhibitor and transport characteristics, which clearly separate it from the well-studied sarcoendoplasmic reticulum (SERCA) and plasma membrane (PMCA) Ca2+-ATPases (3Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 4Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most interesting transport characteristic of SPCA pumps is their unique ability to transport Mn2+ ions with high affinity (1Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. Missiaen L. Eur. J.

Haploinsufficiency of the human ATP2C1 gene for SPCA1 results in Hailey Hailey disease, characterized by acantholysis of the epidermis (5Hu Z. Bonifas J.M. Beech J. Bench G. Shigihara T. Ogawa H.

Members of the P-ATPase superfamily share common structural and mechanistic properties yet have strikingly different ion specificities that underlie their individual physiological roles. In the reaction cycle of the P-ATPases, the E1 conformation of the pump binds ATP and the cation(s) to be transported with high affinity, followed by transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP to an invariant aspartate to form an aspartyl-phosphate reaction intermediate. A major change in enzyme conformation to the E2 form ensues, with a large reduction in ion binding affinity and reorientation of the binding pocket resulting in vectorial ion transport (7East J.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 17: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of SERCA in the E1 conformation, at 2.6-Å resolution, provides a structural definition for two high affinity Ca2+ binding sites enclosed by the transmembrane domains M4, M5, M6, and M8 (8). More recently, a second structure of the enzyme locked in the E2 conformation, was resolved by x-ray crystallography to 3.1 Å (9Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). These structures revealed large domain movements within the cytoplasmic regions as well as twisting and elongation of transmembrane helices involved in cation interactions presumably during transition from the E1 to E2 conformations. The repertoire of cations transported by the P-ATPases includes, but is not limited to, H+, K+, Na+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Mg2+. To understand the molecular basis for ion specificity, we have used phenotypic screening in yeast to identify mutations that alter selectivity for Ca2+ and Mn2+ in PMR1. Growth of the Δpmr1 null strain is hypersensitive to divalent cation-chelating agents such as BAPTA and EGTA, due to depletion of Ca2+ and Mn2+ from the secretory pathway where they serve essential functions in protein processing, sorting, and glycosylation (10Rudolph H.K.

Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). BAPTA toxicity can be overcome by the addition of either Ca2+ or Mn2+ to the medium, indicating that these two ions play largely surrogate roles in supporting growth (13Loukin S. Kung C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1025-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, because Ca2+ is present in ∼100-fold excess over Mn2+ in standard yeast media and because Mn2+ is efficiently removed at low chelator concentrations, the observed growth inhibition of pmr1 mutants by BAPTA represents a titration of available Ca2+. Thus, we have previously demonstrated an excellent correlation between loss of Ca2+ transport activity in PMR1 mutants and growth sensitivity to BAPTA (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Loss of Mn2+ transport by PMR1 mutants is known to confer hypersensitivity to Mn2+ toxicity (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X. Fink G.R. Culotta V. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although Mn2+ is an essential trace element, excess Mn2+ is toxic and must be sequestered and removed via the secretory pathway by PMR1 (15Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Liu X. Fink G.R. Culotta V. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, growth sensitivities to BAPTA and Mn2+ are rapid and effective means to screen pmr1 mutants for loss of ion transport. Differential sensitivity to BAPTA and Mn2+ is potentially indicative of a change in ion selectivity in the mutant, which can then be verified by biochemical characterization. In a previous study we have described the effects of mutations at Gln-783, positioned at the cytoplasmic interface of transmembrane helix M6 (16Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar). Bulky residues (Leu, Glu, and Thr) could effectively substitute for Gln in the transport of both Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions. Conversely, introduction of small polar side chains (Ser, Asn, and Cys) at this site led to complete loss of transport, whereas an Ala substitution was unique in conferring a striking and selective loss of Mn2+ transport. Evidence for a loss of Mn2+ selectivity in the Q783A mutant came from the observed loss of (i) Mn2+-tolerant growth, (ii) Mn2+ inhibition of 45Ca2+ transport, (iii) Mn2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis and phosphoenzyme formation, and (iv) Mn2+ inhibition of phosphoenzyme formation from inorganic phosphate. In contrast, BAPTA tolerance, 45Ca2+ transport, and Ca2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis and phosphoenzyme formation were normal in this mutant (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar). Ab initio modeling of transmembrane helices M4 and M6 of PMR1 placed Gln-783 (M6) in close proximity to Val-335 (M4) and led us to propose that mutations at position 783 might alter ion selectivity by interfering with helix packing. In this work, we examine additional residues in the vicinity of Gln-783 and specifically test the hypothesis that the interaction between Gln-783 and Val-335 is critical for Mn2+ transport. Media, Strains, and Plasmids—Yeast were grown in minimal medium containing yeast nitrogen base (6.7 g/liter, Difco), glucose (2%), and supplements as needed. Strain K616 (Δpmr1Δpmc1Δcnb1 (17Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar)) was used as host; this strain has no endogenous Ca2+-ATPase activity (3Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced in the low copy plasmid YCpHR4 and screened for changes in phenotype (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This plasmid carries the PMR1 gene behind a tandem repeat of the yeast heat shock element and directs the expression of low levels of PMR1 in cells cultured at 25 °C. For biochemical assays, the mutations were moved into the multicopy plasmid YEpHisPMR1 from which N-terminal His9-tagged PMR1 was expressed at moderate levels from the PGK promoter (4Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14534-14541Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This was done by cloning a unique 3.3-kbp BamHI to SacI fragment of the PMR1 gene containing the desired mutation(s) from YCpHR4 into the same sites on YEpHisPMR1. An N-terminal GFP-tagged version of PMR1 (pSR850) was constructed by cutting pYepHis-PMR1 (the amino-tagged His9 version of PMR1) with MluI and SacI and ligated in-frame into plasmid pRA101, which is a 2μ expression plasmid expressing GFP under control of the PGK promoter. Mutant proteins were constructed by amplifying the open reading frame of mutant PMR1 from the YCpHR4 vector using a 5′ primer that contained an MluI site and a 3′ primer that contained a SacI site. The amplified product was purified form was gel-purified, cut with MluI and SacI, and ligated into MluI- and SacI-digested pSR850. Sequencing was done to confirm the existence of the intended mutation in the final GFP-tagged construct. Mutagenesis—In most cases, site-directed mutations in M2, M4, M5, and M6 were generated in either a 1.4-kb HindIII-EcoRI, 1-kb BamHI-EcoRI fragment of PMR1 (M2 or M4) or in a 0.9-kbp EcoRI-PstI fragment (M5 or M6) subcloned into pBluescript, sequenced to confirm the mutation, and moved to pYCPHR4 expression plasmid as previously described (14). In some cases, the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce mutations. For random mutations at Val-335, one primer containing random bases at codon 335 was used in conjunction with a complementary primer to generate mutations at this site using the modified cyclical polymerase chain reaction approach of Gama and Breitwieser (18Gama L. Breitwieser G.E. BioTechniques. 1999; 5: 814-816Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The fragment was completely sequenced to identify the one or more base substitutions in codon 335 and to rule out unwanted errors that may have been incorporated during in vitro synthesis. The fragment was then used to replace the corresponding DNA in YCpHR4. Double mutations at 335 were combined with mutations at residue 783 by subcloning the corresponding fragments into the YCp plasmid. The identity of mutations in the YCp expression plasmid was confirmed to rule out the possibility of unwanted cloning artifacts or wild type sequences. Phenotype Screens—Growth assays were performed in 96-well plates containing 175 μl of supplemented YNB medium. 2–5 μl of saturated seed culture was incubated at 25 or 30 °C for 2 days. MnCl2 or BAPTA was added to the growth medium at the final concentrations indicated; BAPTA-containing medium was buffered to pH 6.0 with 100 mm MES/HCl. Growth was assessed by measuring absorbance at 600 nm on a Molecular Devices SpectraMax 340 plate reader. Unless otherwise noted, readings were normalized to control samples in which MnCl2 or BAPTA were omitted. Enzyme Purification and Biochemical Assays—Solubilization and purification of wild type or mutant (His)9-Pmr1 using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) has been described in detail (16Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) by purified (His)9-Pmr1 (1 μg) was assayed at 25 °C in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (500–600 cpm/pmol). CaCl2 or MnCl2 was added and buffered with EGTA to give free cation concentrations that were determined using the WinMaxChelator computer program. Activated charcoal (Sigma) was used to separate free phosphate from ATP, as described earlier (16Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar). 54Manganese Accumulation—Yeast from 2-day-old saturated cultures were inoculated into 500 μl of minimal media with nutrient supplements to yield an initial A 600 of 0.1 for n = 3 wells in a 24-well tissue culture plate. Approximately 1 nm54MnCl (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 7600 mCi/mg, ∼1.2 × 106 counts/well) was added per well, and yeast were grown at room temperature and assayed for 54Mn2+ accumulation 24 h post-inoculation by collection onto Millipore 0.45-μm HAWP filters using vacuum filtration. Filters were washed with 10 ml of wash buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl), dissolved in 1 ml of dimethylformamide, and counted in 10 ml of scintillation fluid. Yeast growth was measured after 10-fold dilution by absorbance at 600 nm on Genesys 5 spectrometer (Spectronic). Homology Modeling of PMR1—Homology modeling of S. cerevisiae PMR1 (Accession NP_011348) in the E1 conformation was done using Swiss-PDB viewer (version 3.7b2) by “fitting the raw sequence” of PMR1 to 1EUL.pdb, which is the 2.6-Å resolution crystal structure of Oryctolagus cuniculus SERCA1a (accession P04191) in the Ca2+-bound E1 state (8Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Similarly, a homology model of PMR1 in the E2 conformation was generated using atomic coordinates from 1IWO.pdb for the E2-like SERCA structure (9Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The default alignment settings in Swiss-PDB viewer were used for the initial alignment followed by manual optimization of the alignment to maximize homology between M4 and M5–M7 as shown in Fig. 5. The resulting homology model of PMR1 is based on the Cα positions of 1EUL.pdb and 1IWO.pdb. The single Ca2+ ion shown in the model was incorporated by merging the Ca2+ ion from site II of the SERCA1a into the aligned regions of PMR1. The images in Fig. 6 were generated by using the rendering program Pov-Ray.Fig. 6E1 and E2 conformations of PMR1 showing transmembrane helices M4, M5, and M6. Homology models of PMR1 were based on the crystal structures of the E1 and E2 conformations of SERCA1a and the alignment in Fig. 6 (“Experimental Procedures”). Helices are shown perpendicular to the plane of the membrane (A and B) or in cross-section from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane (C and D). Residues Gln-783 (orange) and Val-335 (purple) are shown in space-filled form. A calcium ion (yellow sphere) occupying Site II in the E1 conformation has been included. Amino acid side chains are colored green, red, and yellow based on the effect of substitutions reported in this and previous work (Table I and Ref. 14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Residues contributing to the calcium binding site in the E1 structure are displaced in E2. Note the movements in the cytoplasmic (lower) halves of M4 and M6 that bring Val-335 and Gln-783 in proximity in the E2 conformation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Scanning Mutagenesis of Side Chains Proximal to Gln-783— The unique ion selectivity defect of mutant Q783A prompted a scanning mutagenesis survey of neighboring residues, within a 7-Å radius, based on the E1 crystal structure of the homologous SERCA1 pump. Specifically, we targeted residues Gln-134, Glu-135, Tyr-136, and Arg-137 of M2, and Phe-738 in M5 that could potentially interact with the Gln side chain at position 783. Each of these residues was replaced with Ala and Ile. Because Gln-783 lies near the cytoplasmic interface of M5, we also performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of residues in the cytoplasmic half of transmembrane segments M4, M5, and M6. Mutants were expressed from a low copy plasmid in a yeast host strain lacking endogenous Ca2+ pumps (K616 (3Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar)) and screened for complementation of BAPTA and Mn2+-hypersensitive phenotypes. Previously, we have assayed ion transport in purified Golgi vesicles and ATP hydrolysis in purified enzyme preparations and demonstrated that these properties correlate with growth sensitivity of mutant strains to BAPTA and Mn2+ toxicity (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 16Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar). Table I depicts K 0.5 values for BAPTA and Mn2+ for mutants, expressed as percentage of wild type. Substitutions at Gln-134, Glu-135, and Tyr-136 in transmembrane segment M2 had no appreciable effect on PMR1 activity, as judged by their normal or near-normal phenotypes. Only Arg-137 appeared to be sensitive to substitution, and surprisingly, the Ala substitution was more deleterious than the bulkier Met. One mutation in M4, L341A, showed complete loss of function when expressed in low copy (Table I) but was similar to wild type when expressed from a multicopy plasmid (not shown). This mutation is therefore likely to have some reduction in turnover that can be compensated by overexpression. Substitution of the evolutionarily conserved Phe-738 at the cytoplasmic interface of M5 by either Ile or Ala led to a complete loss in ability to complement the pmr1 null phenotypes, from single copy (Table I) or multicopy (not shown) expression plasmids, indicating a critical role for this residue. We had reported earlier that substitution of another residue in M5, Gln-742, with alanine led to a loss of function (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of this residue further, we performed random mutagenesis at position 742 and screened the resulting substitutions for BAPTA and Mn2+ sensitivity (Fig. 1, A and B). Of nine different substitutions tested (Arg, Lys, Glu, Thr, Leu, Pro, Ser, Ala, and Cys), only the closely related side-chain Glu could partially replace Gln at this site, whereas all other substitutions led to loss of function.Table ISummary of phenotype screens on PMR1 mutationsFig. 1Phenotypic effects of substitutions at Gln-742 on BAPTA and Mn2+ tolerance. The host strain K616, carrying null alleles of endogenous Ca2+ pumps (Delta PMR1), was transformed with low copy plasmid expressing wild type or mutant PMR1 carrying the indicated amino acid substitutions at position 742. Mutant Q742X has a termination codon at position 742. Cultures were grown in media supplemented with BAPTA (A) or Mn2+ (B). Growth (A 600) is expressed as a percentage of control (no BAPTA or Mn2+ added).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In M6, mutant L785A, also near the cytoplasmic interface, exhibited a partial loss of function as judged by partial complementation of BAPTA and Mn2+ sensitivities in low copy (Table I), and full complementation following high copy expression (not shown). Not surprisingly, mutant G779T located in a conserved motif immediately adjacent to the calcium-binding residue Asp-778 was also inactive. Interestingly, mutant G779A was more sensitive to Mn2+ toxicity, relative to BAPTA (Table I), suggestive of a change in the relative affinity for Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions in this mutant. Similarly, analysis of phosphoenzyme formation in the human SPCA1 homologue has revealed that the Hailey Hailey disease mutant G309C in M4 fails to bind Mn2+ while retaining reduced Ca2+ binding affinity (19Fairclough R.J. Dode L. Vanoevelen J. Andersen J.P. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. Hovnanian A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24721-24730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). G309C is located immediately proximal to the conserved Glu in the ion binding pocket. It should be noted that most substitutions result in largely similar changes in BAPTA and Mn2+ sensitivities (for example, E788A in Table I). This study revealed several potential ion selectivity mutants, including V335A in M4, M777A and P781A in M6, that are worthy of further investigation. Of these, a detailed analysis of Val-335 is reported in this work. In summary, the scanning mutagenesis identified several hydrophobic residues near the cytoplasmic interface of M4, M5, and M6 that appear to be critical for ion transport. In addition, the requirement for a carboxyl oxygen (from Gln or Glu) suggests that residue Gln-742 may be participate in ion binding. In an earlier study, we had identified several polar or charged residues distributed in the middle tiers of transmembrane helices M4–M8 that might participate in ion binding. The results from this and our previous mutagenesis studies give an increasingly comprehensive picture of the importance of individual residues along the transport pathway. Subcellular Localization of GFP-tagged PMR1 Mutants—We have previously demonstrated that some loss-of-function PMR1 mutants are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, where they appear hypersensitive to limited proteolysis by trypsin, indicative of structural or folding defects (14Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was therefore important to determine if mutations reported in this study showed normal biogenesis and trafficking to the Golgi. All mutants showing partial or complete loss of function, were tagged with GFP, and examined by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The mutants showed a punctate distribution typical of yeast Golgi bodies and were essentially identical to wild type (Fig. 2). Thus, loss of function appears to be related to a catalytic, rather than a biogenesis defect. Substitutions at Val-335 Mimic or Suppress the Mn2 + Transport Defect of Mutation Q783A—Based on ab initio modeling of M4 and M6 helices, we had suggested earlier that Gln-783 in M6 formed a hydrophobic contact with Val-335 in M4 (16Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we generated a series of substitutions at position 335 of PMR1 and analyzed the effect of the mutations by screening for BAPTA and Mn2+ toxicity. We found that Cys was not tolerated at 335, whereas residues with large side chains (Thr, Leu, and Ile) were similar to wild type (not shown). These findings were reminiscent of our mutational analysis of residue 783 (16Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutant V335G showed a significant and reproducible difference in response to BAPTA and Mn2+ toxicity, indicative of a change in ion selectivity (Fig. 3). A similar trend was observed for the V335A mutation (Table I). Next, we tested whether introduction of the bulkier Ile side chain at residue 335 (V335I) could compensate for loss of side-chain volume in the Q783A mutant. We found that the double mutant V335I/Q783A showed a striking recovery in Mn2+-tolerant growth, relative to that of the single mutant Q783A (Fig. 3). In contrast, mutations in Gln-134, Glu-135, Tyr-136, and Arg-137, also within interacting distance, were ineffective in restoring the Mn2+-sensitive phenotype of mutant Q783A (not shown). To verify these findings, we measured cation dependence of ATP hydrolysis. Mutants V335G and V335I/Q783A were tagged at the N terminus with a 9xHis epitope and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (“Experimental Procedures”). ATP hydrolysis was assayed as described earlier (16Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar), and the apparent K m for Ca2+ and Mn2+ was determined. We have shown earlier that ATPase activity of His-tagged wild type PMR1 is strictly dependent on the presence of calcium (Km 0.07 μm) or manganese (Km 0.02 μm) ions (16Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar). Although the apparent affinity for Ca2+ was not significantly different from wild type, the V335G mutant showed an 8-fold loss in affinity for Mn2+, consistent with the prediction from the phenotype screen (Table II). Previously, we had shown that Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity in the Q783A mutant was nearly identical to wild type (0.06 μm), whereas Mn2+-ATPase was too low to analyze (16Mandal D. Woolf T. Rao R. J. Biol. Cell. 2000; 273: 23933-23938Google Scholar). Table II shows that the apparent K m for Mn2+ in the V335I/Q783A double mutant was similar to wild type, demonstrating an effective correction of the Mn2+ transport defect. Thus, engineering a large reduction in side-chain volume at residue 335 (V335G) mimics the Q783A substitution, whereas an increase in side-chain volume (V335I) compensates for the Q783A mutation, consistent with a packing interaction between M4 and M6 at these sites.Table IICation dependence of ATP hydrolysisPMR1Mn2+ KMCa2+ KMμmWild type0.02 ± 0.0060.07 ± 0.001Q783ANDaND, not detectable; Mn2+-stimulated ATPase activity was too low to measure (16).0.06 ± 0.001V335G0.16 ± 0.020.12 ± 0.05V335I/Q783A0.02 ± 0.0070.09 ± 0.02a ND, not detectable; Mn2+-stimul"
https://openalex.org/W2004771840,"Abstract The human adeno-associated virus (AAV) has generated much enthusiasm as a transfer vector for human gene therapy. Although clinical gene therapy trials have been initiated using AAV vectors, much remains to be learned regarding the basic mechanisms of virus replication, gene expression, and virion assembly. AAV encodes four nonstructural, or replication (Rep), proteins. The Rep78 and Rep68 proteins regulate viral DNA replication, chromosomal integration, and gene expression. The Rep52 and Rep40 proteins mediate virus assembly. To better understand Rep protein function, we have expressed the Rep40 protein in Escherichia coli and purified it to near homogeneity. Like the other Rep proteins, Rep40 possesses helicase and ATPase activity. ATP is the best substrate, and Mg2+ is the most efficient divalent metal ion for helicase activity. A Lys to His mutation in the purine nucleotide-binding site results in a protein that inhibits helicase activity in a dominant negative manner. Rep40 unwinds double-stranded DNA containing a 3′ single-stranded end, or blunt end, unlike the Rep68 and Rep52 enzymes, which have a strict requirement for DNA duplexes containing a 3′ single-stranded end. Values for KATP in the ATPase assay are 1.1 ± 0.2 mm and 1.2 ± 0.2 mm in the absence and presence, respectively, of single-stranded DNA. Values for Vmax are 220 ± 10 and 1,500 ± 90 nmol/min/mg in the absence and presence, respectively, of single-stranded DNA. These studies provide the first enzymatic characterization of the AAV Rep40 protein and elucidate important functional differences between the AAV helicases."

The adenine residues of GATC sequences on both strands of Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA are methylated at the 6-amino group (1Geier G.E. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1408-1413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon replication, GATC sequences exist transiently in a hemi-methylated state; the newly synthesized strand remains unmethylated until it becomes methylated by Dam methylase, whereas the parental strand retains its methylation (2Campbell J.L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 62: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). For one-third of the cell cycle, replicated oriC, the origin of chromosomal replication containing 11 repeats of GATC sequences within 245 bp, exists in a hemi-methylated state, even though other regions are immediately methylated within 1–2 min (2Campbell J.L. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 62: 967-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 3Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). This delayed methylation is caused by the binding of the SeqA sequestration protein to hemi-methylated oriC (3Lu M.

In these mutants, the timing of chromosomal initiation is disturbed, and the frequency of initiation increases (3Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N.

A. 1996; 93: 12206-12211Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The asynchronous and overinitiation of chromosomal replication indicates that SeqA functions as a negative modulator for chromosomal initiation at oriC. Negative modulation appears to be achieved by the binding of SeqA to oriC, which blocks initiation (7Wold S. Boye E. Slater S. Kleckner N. Skarstad K.

The minimal requirement is two hemi-methylated sites that are up to 31 bases apart on the same face of duplex DNA. Cooperative interaction between SeqA proteins bound on each hemi-methylated site is a proposed requirement for stable complex formation. The E. coli chromosome sequence predicts that 1750 pairs of GATC sequences exist for the optimal binding of SeqA (10Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The SeqA protein is a homotetramer of 21-kDa polypeptides (11Lee H. Kang S. Bae S.H. Choi B.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol.

The N-terminal region of SeqA (SeqA-N; amino acid residues 1–50) donates its tetrameric property, and the C-terminal region (SeqA-C; 51–181) contains the binding domain for a hemi-methylated GATC sequence (12Guarné A. Zhao Q. Ghirlando R. Yang W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar). Co-crystal structure analysis of SeqA-C with 12 bp of DNA containing one hemi-methylated site revealed that SeqA-C interacts with the major groove of DNA through direct hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts with the hemi-methylated A-T base pair and interacts with the surrounding bases and DNA backbone (12Guarné A. Zhao Q. Ghirlando R. Yang W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar). Although the co-crystal structure suggests that a monomeric SeqA-C recognizes a hemi-methylated GATC site, whether stable binding of a SeqA tetramer requires two hemi-methylated sites remains to be elucidated (9Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).

Foci formation is dependent upon Dam function and DNA replication, but not upon the presence of oriC. The number of foci is proportional to growth rate (10Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K.

SeqA proteins binding to the replicated, hemi-methylated chromosomal DNA and appearing to track the replication fork might be visualized as SeqA foci. Even though the oriC region contains more highly repeated GATC sequences than any other region of the chromosome and exists in a hemi-methylated state for one-third of the cell cycle, SeqA foci rarely overlap with oriC (13Hiraga S.

These phenotypes of the seqA mutant, irrelevant to the role of SeqA as a negative regulator for initiation of chromosomal replication (3Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N.

The function of SeqA as a regulator for chromosomal initiation and chromosome segregation appears to be exerted by the binding of SeqA to hemi-methylated GATC sequences (4Slater S. Wold S. Lu M.

Recent analysis of the co-crystal structure of truncated SeqA-C and 12 bp of DNA containing a hemi-methylated GATC sequence shows that SeqA-C binds to a hemi-methylated site and its flanking region (12Guarné A. Zhao Q. Ghirlando R. Yang W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar). However, the behavior of truncated, monomeric SeqA-C differs from the behavior of intact SeqA tetramers. Together with the co-crystal structure, our findings concerning the binding of one SeqA protein to paired hemi-methylated sites, aggregation, and absence of cross-binding of the bound SeqA proteins provide insights into the function of SeqA in vivo. Materials—Sources were as follows: restriction enzymes and cloning enzymes, Promega; [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) and poly(dI-dC), Amersham Biosciences; and non- and methylated synthetic oligonucleotides, Genotech. Unless otherwise indicated, reagents were purchased from Sigma. Bacterial Strains and Plasmid DNAs—The E. coli strain Top10F'(Invitrogen) was used for cloning and preparing fully methylated plasmid DNA, and the GM3819(dam16:kmr) strain (25Boye E. Løbner-Olesen A. Cell. 1990; 62: 981-989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was used for preparing unmethylated plasmid DNA. E. coli BL21 (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

E. coli W3SQT(seqA::Tetr) was obtained by transducing W3110 (27Bachmann B.J. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 525-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with P1 phage prepared from NK9050(seqA::Tetr) (3Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and was then used for overproducing mutant SeqA proteins. The pBMA1 (28Hwang D.S.

For constructing pBMA2, pBMA1 was digested with BglII, filled in with the Klenow fragment, and religated. Proteins—The seqA mutant genes expressing corresponding mutant proteins were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis as previously described (11Lee H. Kang S. Bae S.H. Choi B.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol.

DNAs Containing Hemi-methylated Sites—Hemi-methylated DNAs containing 1–6 and 17 GATC sites are described in Fig. 1A. The 75-bp DNA fragment containing hemi-methylated sites was obtained by annealing synthetic oligomers, top-strand (5′-ctgggtattaaaaagaagatctatttattta gagatctgttctattgtgatctcttattaggatcgcactgccct-3′) and bottom-strand (5′-agggcagtgcgatcctaataagagatcacaatagaacagatctctaaataaatagatcttctttttaatacccag-3′). The N 6-methyladenine bases within GATC sequences of the B-strand are indicated in the corresponding figures.

N 6-methyladenine bases are indicated by boldface.Fig. 3One SeqA tetramer binds to every two hemi-methylated GATC sequences. A, the following DNA fragments were used for gel shift assays: 39-bp DNA containing two hemi-methylated sites (lanes 1–5); 75-bp DNA containing two un- and two hemi-methylated sites (lanes 6–10); 75-bp DNA containing four hemi-methylated GATC sequences (lanes 11–15).

B, the 75-bp DNA fragment containing four hemi-methylated GATC sequences was used with the indicated amount of protein: SeqA, 0, 40, 70, 52, 40, 28, 17, 10, 5, and 0 ng (lanes 1–10); SeqA(K66E-R70E), 0, 0, 3.6, 6, 9, 12, 14.5, 16, 18, and 10 ng (lanes 1–10); 20 ng of co-expressed SeqA/SeqA(K66E-R70E) (lane 11). For co-expression, wild-type seqA was cloned into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of pBAD18, and seqA(K66E-R70E) was cloned into the EcoRI/HindIII sites of pBAD33 (21Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J.

The reaction mixture was incubated for 15 min at 32 °C. The subsequent steps have been previously described (5Kang S. Lee H. Han J.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol.

Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Papavassiliou A.G. Kneale G.G. DNA-Protein Interactions: Principles and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1994: 43-78Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The top or bottom strand of synthetic hemi-methylated 75-mer DNAs was 32P-end-labeled and incubated with SeqA for 15 min at 30 °C, followed by treatment with 200 μm 1,10-phenanthroline-copper and 5.8 mm 3-mercaptopropionic acid for 35 s at 30 °C. The cleavage reaction was stopped by adding 0.1 volume of 28 mm 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline. SeqA-bound DNA and free DNA were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (5% w/v). Subsequent steps were performed as described previously (31Lee Y.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 83-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). SeqA Binds Two Hemi-methylated GATC Sequences—Stable binding of SeqA to hemi-methylated DNA requires at least two hemi-methylated GATC sequences (9Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 10Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We analyzed SeqA binding to DNA by gel shift assays of DNA containing 1–6 and 17 hemi-methylated sites in the presence of competitor DNA poly(dI-dC) (Fig. 1). For DNAs containing up to six hemi-methylated sites, SeqA forms as many as three discrete, consecutive complexes (Fig. 1B). A new complex with the most retarded migration appeared for all samples with an odd number of hemi-methylated sites; the formation of this complex was more efficient when one additional site was added. As the number of hemi-methylated sites and the level of SeqA increased, slower migration of newly appearing complexes indicated that more SeqA proteins were bound step by step to form higher-order complexes. With DNAs containing six hemi-methylated sites, large complexes located at the upper region and the wells of polyacrylamide gels began to appear. The DNAs containing 6 and 17 hemi-methylated sites produced three, and at least six, more discrete complexes, respectively, followed by formation of larger complexes retained near the wells. These large complexes were previously observed with DNAs containing a number of GATC sequences (3Lu M. Campbell J.L. Boye E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1994; 77: 413-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 20Skarstad K. Lueder G. Lurz R Speck C. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1319-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At elevated levels of SeqA, the absence of large complexes for the DNAs containing less than six hemi-methylated sites excluded the possibility that previously aggregated SeqA proteins, formed before DNA binding, were bound to the DNA. Because the DNAs used in the preceding experiments contained different primary sequences, lengths, and numbers of GATC sequences, we used synthetic oligonucleotides containing identical sequences but having one to four N 6-methyladenine residues within GATC sequences on a strand (Fig. 2A). SeqA binding to the DNAs containing one or two hemi-methylated sites produced a fast-mobility complex, but formation of this complex was enhanced with two hemi-methylated sites. A new slow mobility complex appeared with three hemi-methylated sites, and this complex formation was enhanced with four hemi-methylated sites. The appearance of new complexes with an odd number of hemi-methylated sites and enhanced formation of these complexes upon addition of one site agree with the results in Fig. 1B. Identical mobilities in a polyacrylamide gel imply that the complexes contain the same number of SeqA molecules. The binding patterns of SeqA in such slow mobility complexes were compared by using OP-Cu(II) chemical footprinting analysis (Fig. 2B). For DNA containing four hemi-methylated sites, SeqA protected all four sites of DNA containing four hemi-methylated sites from chemical cleavage. On DNA containing three hemi-methylated sites and one unmethylated site, SeqA protected all three hemi-methylated sites but hardly protected the unmethylated site, suggesting that the inefficient formation of new complexes (complexes with slowest mobility) with an odd number of GATC sites (Figs. 1B and 2A) was caused by the inefficient binding of one SeqA to one hemi-methylated site. These results indicate that efficient binding of SeqA requires two hemi-methylated sites and that additional binding of SeqA to a set of two more sites mediates formation of higher order complexes. One SeqA Tetramer Binds to Each Set of Two Hemi-methylated GATC Sequences—The requirement of two hemi-methylated sites for efficient SeqA binding (Figs. 1 and 2) and the tetrameric nature of SeqA (11Lee H. Kang S. Bae S.H. Choi B.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34600-34606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Guarné A. Zhao Q. Ghirlando R. Yang W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar) raise the question as to whether the two sites are bound by one or more SeqA tetramers. To address this question, we isolated a mutant SeqA protein, SeqA(K66E-R70E), in which Lys-66 and Arg-70 residues of SeqA were substituted with glutamates. The complexes formed by SeqA(K66E-R70E) migrated more quickly than complexes formed by SeqA (Fig. 3). Whereas a mixture of independently purified SeqA and SeqA(K66E-R70E) proteins generated two different fast mobility complexes formed by SeqA and SeqA(K66E-R70E), the mixture exhibited one additional slow mobility complex that possessed an intermediate mobility between the mobility of slow-mobility complexes formed by SeqA and SeqA(K66E-R70E) separately (Fig. 3A). The seqA and seqA(K66E-R70E) genes were co-expressed in E. coli, and the resulting SeqA/SeqA(K66E-R70E) protein was purified. Because the expression levels of both proteins were different and SeqA is tetrameric, the four subunits of SeqA/SeqA(K66E-R70E) were heterogeneous mixtures of SeqA and SeqA(K66E-R70E) polypeptides. Therefore, SeqA/SeqA(K66E-R70E) would produce complexes possessing distinctive mobilities that differed from the mobilities of complexes formed by the mixture of independently purified SeqA and SeqA(K66E-R70E) (Fig. 3A , lanes 5, 10, and 15; Fig. 3B , lane 11). The ratio of amounts of SeqA and SeqA(K66E-R70E) varied with the DNA containing four hemi-methylated sites (Fig. 3B). As the ratio of SeqA(K66E-R70E) increased, the amount of complexes formed by SeqA decreased, and complexes formed by SeqA(K66E-R70E) appeared. Even though a fast-mobility complex with intermediate mobility was not formed, one slow-mobility complex possessing an intermediate mobility appeared and disappeared as the ratio of SeqA(K66E-R70E) increased. The formation of one slow-mobility complex and the absence of a fast-mobility complex with intermediate mobility agrees with the results shown in Fig. 3A. The absence of a fast-mobility complex possessing intermediate mobility indicates that SeqA or SeqA(K66E-R70E) bind exclusively to each set of two hemi-methylated sites and that exchange of subunits does not occur between the purified proteins in the DNA binding reaction. It has been proposed that to form a stable complex, one SeqA unit bound on a hemi-methylated site requires cooperative interaction with another SeqA bound on a different site (9Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this case, with DNA containing four hemi-methylated sites, one fast-mobility complex, formed by one unit each of SeqA and SeqA(K66E-R70E), and three different slow-mobility complexes, formed by three and one, two and two, and one and three units of SeqA and SeqA(K66E-R70E), respectively, with intermediate mobility must be formed in addition to the complexes formed by SeqA and SeqA(K66E-R70E) alone. Whereas co-expressed SeqA/SeqA(K66E-R70E) generated some of these intermediates, the mixing or challenging of independently purified SeqA and SeqA(K66E-R70E) produced no such fast-mobility complex and only one slow-mobility complex that possessed intermediate mobility (Fig. 3). The exclusive binding of SeqA or SeqA(K66E-R70E) to two hemi-methylated sites to form a fast-mobility complex and the existence of one slow-mobility complex with intermediate mobility indicate that one SeqA tetramer binds to every two hemi-methylated sites. Therefore, the slow mobility complex with intermediate mobility is consistent with the binding of one SeqA to one pair of hemi-methylated sites and the binding of one SeqA(K66E-R70E) to the pair of hemi-methylated sites. SeqA Does Not Cross-link to the Hemi-methylated Sites on Separate DNAs—The binding of a SeqA tetramer to each of two hemi-methylated sites (Fig. 3) raises the possibility that every two monomers of the tetramer might bind to the hemi-methylated sites on different molecules of DNA. Because this inter-DNA binding can not be discriminated in the DNA binding assays by using homogeneous DNA, for SeqA binding assays, we used a fixed amount of 130-bp DNA with six hemi-methylated sites and variable amounts of the 75-bp DNA with four hemi-methylated sites, or vice versa (Fig. 4). The 130- and 75-bp hemi-methylated DNA produced three and two discernible complexes, respectively. No reduction of the complexes formed with a fixed amount of DNA occurred with the increased formation of complexes with the other DNA. Each complex was formed with either 130 or 75 bp of DNA. No new complex appeared that exhibited a distinctive mobility that differed from the complexes formed by either 130 or 75 bp of DNA. These results imply that the cross-linking of a SeqA tetramer to separate DNAs does not occur under our assay conditions. However, the cross-linking of two hemi-methylated oriC by SeqA was proposed from the crystal packing structure of the SeqA-C-DNA complex (12Guarné A. Zhao Q. Ghirlando R. Yang W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy could be caused by differences in the molecular behaviors of an intact SeqA tetramer and truncated monomeric SeqA-C or by the presence of highly concentrated SeqA-C in the crystal. Aggregation of SeqA to the SeqA Proteins Bound on Hemi-methylated DNA—In comparison to DNAs possessing at least five hemi-methylated sites, SeqA binding to DNAs containing 6 and 17 hemi-methylated sites produced large complexes that were retarded near the wells of the gel (Fig. 1B). The formation of these large, aggregated complexes was analyzed (Fig. 5). In SeqA, Val-88 interacts with the phosphate backbone for SeqA binding to a hemi-methylated GATC sequence (12Guarné A. Zhao Q. Ghirlando R. Yang W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar); the substitution of Val-88 to Gly abolished binding to hemi-methylated DNAs (data not shown). In the absence of SeqA, SeqA(V88G)-CH, which contains a hexa-histidine-tag at the C terminus of the SeqA(V88G) protein (Fig. 5, A and B , lane 5), was also unable to bind to DNAs possessing four or six hemi-methylated sites, whereas SeqA-CH, which contains a His6 tag at the C terminus of wild-type SeqA, was able to bind to these DNAs (Fig. 5, A and B , lane 9). SeqA(V88G)-CH had no effect on the formation of fast mobility (complex-I) and slow mobility (complex-II) complexes, which are produced by the binding of SeqA to two and four hemi-methylated sites, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). The inability of SeqA(V88G)-CH to convert the complexes to larger complexes implies that SeqA(V88G)-CH can not bind to hemi-methylated sites, even cooperatively with SeqA. However, increasing the amount of SeqA(V88G)-CH shifted the most retarded complex, complex-III, which is presumably formed by the binding of three molecules of the SeqA tetramer to the six hemi-methylated sites of DNA, to the wells of polyacrylamide gels. Cleavage of the SeqA protein with trypsin yields two fragments, SeqA-N (amino acid residues 1–50) and SeqA-C-(51–181) (12Guarné A. Zhao Q. Ghirlando R. Yang W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of poly(dI-dC), although SeqA-C binds 12- and 14-bp DNAs containing one hemi-methylated site (12Guarné A. Zhao Q. Ghirlando R. Yang W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fujikawa N. Kurumizaka H. Yamazoe M. Hiraga S. Yokoyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), in our gel-shift assays containing poly(dI-dC), SeqA-C containing the DNA binding domain, did not form a stable complex with the hemi-methylated DNAs (Fig. 5C , lane 10). In addition, SeqA-C did not affect formation of SeqA-DNA complexes (I, II, and III) (lanes 7–9, 15, and 16). Further, SeqA-N did not influence formation of complex-I and -II, which were produced by SeqA binding to two and four hemi-methylated sites, respectively (lanes 2–4, 12, and 13). In contrast, SeqA-N shifted the migration of complex-III (lanes 3 and 4), implying that the N-terminal fragment, SeqA-N, associates with complex-III as SeqA(V88G)-CH. Although SeqA(V88G)-CH and SeqA-N do not possess binding activity to hemi-methylated DNAs, these proteins associated with the SeqA-DNA complex formed by the binding of SeqA proteins to six hemi-methylated sites. However, this association did not occur with complexes formed by the binding of SeqA proteins to two or four sites. These results indicate that interaction among the SeqA proteins bound on six hemi-methylated sites induces aggregation of the N terminus of free SeqA to the SeqA proteins bound on the DNA, not to the DNA itself. We have demonstrated that one SeqA unit as a tetramer binds to a set of two hemi-methylated GATC sequences (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Even though the binding of monomeric SeqA-C and another C-terminal fragment (amino acid residues 71–181) of SeqA was previously detected to bind to 12- or 14-bp DNAs possessing one hemi-methylated site (12Guarné A. Zhao Q. Ghirlando R. Yang W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fujikawa N. Kurumizaka H. Yamazoe M. Hiraga S. Yokoyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), in gel-shift assays with poly(dI-dC) competitor DNA, the intact SeqA protein did not bind significantly to DNAs containing one hemi-methylated site (Figs. 1B and 2A; Ref. 9Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the presence of poly(dI-dC), SeqA-C did not bind to hemi-methylated DNA nor did it compete with SeqA for DNA binding (Fig. 5C). These discrepancies indicate that the molecular behavior of SeqA differs from the behavior of truncated SeqA. A SeqA tetramer binds to two hemi-methylated sites on a DNA fragment (Figs. 1, 2, 3). SeqA was unable to cross-bind to hemi-methylated sites on separate DNAs (Fig. 4). The binding of the truncated, monomeric C-terminal fragment of SeqA to a hemi-methylated site indicates that a SeqA monomer recognizes a hemi-methylated site (12Guarné A. Zhao Q. Ghirlando R. Yang W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar, 22Fujikawa N. Kurumizaka H. Yamazoe M. Hiraga S. Yokoyama S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These results suggest that two monomers in a tetramer participate in the binding of two hemi-methylated sites to form a stable complex. Dimerization of SeqA monomers by chemical cross-linking (11Lee H. Kang S. Bae S.H. Choi B.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34600-34606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Guarné A. Zhao Q. Ghirlando R. Yang W. Nat. Struct.

Biol. 2002; 9: 839-843PubMed Google Scholar), and footprint analysis of SeqA binding (9Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) suggest a dimeric property of the SeqA protein. A SeqA tetramer might be composed of two dimers. SeqA efficiently binds to two hemi-methylated sites in various positions and spaced up to 31-bp apart, if the two sites are not located at the opposite phase of the helix (10Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Also, two methyl groups of the 6-methyladenine residues in two hemi-methylated GATC sequences can be either in cis or in trans without a significant loss of affinity for SeqA (9Brendler T. Austin S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This flexible recognition and binding of SeqA can be achieved in part by the binding of any monomer in a dimer of a SeqA tetramer on each hemi-methylated site. For DNAs containing 6 and 17 hemi-methylated sites, as the concentration of SeqA increased, large complexes appeared at the upper part and the wells of polyacrylamide gels (Figs. 1B and 5A). The appearance of aggregated complexes following the discrete complexes implies that preferential binding of SeqA proteins to the closed, hemi-methylated sites is followed by the formation of larger complexes. Even in the absence of DNA, SeqA itself reversibly aggregates in a concentration-dependent manner, even though this aggregation requires a much higher SeqA concentration than is typical for DNA binding assay conditions (11Lee H. Kang S. Bae S.H. Choi B.S. Hwang D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34600-34606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The intrinsic aggregation property in the absence of DNA supports that the additional SeqA proteins associate with the SeqA proteins bound on hemi-methylated sites rather than associating with the DNA. The aggregated complexes with DNA containing 17 hemi-methylated sites formed at a lower concentration of SeqA than those DNAs containing six hemi-methylated sites (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that molecular crowdedness of the SeqA protein is a driving force for aggregation. The closeness of the SeqA proteins bound to the hemi-methylated sites enhances the aggregation property of SeqA protein by molecular crowdedness and functions as a nucleation core to recruit free SeqA proteins for aggregation. Association of these aggregated SeqA proteins with the bound SeqA proteins on the adjacent hemi-methylated sites can cause intervening DNA to loop out, as previously proposed (10Brendler T. Sawitzke J. Sergueev K. Austin S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6249-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 23Sawitzke J. Austin S. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These aggregated SeqA proteins on the hemi-methylated sites might be visualized, by using immunofluorescent microscopy and the GFP-SeqA fusion, as SeqA foci, which appear to track replication forks(9Brendler T.

https://openalex.org/W2080951374,"Here, we show that inhibition of c-Myc causes a proliferative arrest of M14 melanoma cells through cellular crisis, evident by the increase in size, multiple nuclei, vacuolated cytoplasm, induction of senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity and massive apoptosis. The c-Myc-induced crisis is associated with decreased human telomerase reverse transcriptase expression, telomerase activity, progressive telomere shortening, glutathione (GSH), depletion and, increased production of reactive oxygen species. Treatment of control cells with l-buthionine sulfoximine decreases GSH to levels of c-Myc low expressing cells, but it does not modify the growth kinetic of the cells. Surprisingly, when GSH is increased in the c-Myc low expressing cells by treatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, cells escape crisis. To test the hypothesis that both oxidative stress and telomerase dysfunction are involved in the c-Myc-dependent crisis, we directly inhibited telomerase function and glutathione levels. Inactivation of telomerase, by expression of a catalytically inactive, dominant negative form of reverse transcriptase, reduces cellular lifespan by inducing telomere shortening. Treatment of cells with l-buthionine sulfoximine decreases GSH content and accelerates cell crisis. Analysis of telomere status demonstrated that oxidative stress affects c-Myc-induced crisis by increasing telomere dysfunction.

The proliferative potential of normal cells in culture is limited to a finite number of population doublings, a phenomenon known as cellular senescence or Hayflick limit (1Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 37: 614-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4330) Google Scholar) that is characterized by a large, flat morphology, telomere shortening, a high frequency of nuclear abnormality and induction of β-galactosidase activity (2Dimri G.P.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 29-41PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that cancer cells must overcome this obstacle and achieve proliferation immortality before they can form malignant neoplasms. Direct experimental evidence implicates telomere erosion as a primary cause of cellular arrest (5Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W.

In the opposite type of experiment, inhibition of telomerase in established tumor cell lines induces telomere shortening, leading to chromosome end-to-end fusions, cell death, and eventually arrest of culture growth (9Hahn W.C.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6958-6968Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that although telomere length is an important trigger for the onset of senescence, increased telomere dysfunction results in a loss of chromosome end protection and induction of senescence state (12Karlseder J. Smogorzewska A. de Lange T. Science. 2002; 295: 2446-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Telomere dysfunction is not an absolute requirement for the induction of senescence, because other kinds of damage can contribute to the process. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), products of normal cellular oxidative process (13Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar), have been shown to be involved in senescence (14Chen Q. Fischer A. Reagan J.D. Yan L.J. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4337-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Senescent cells are known to have higher levels of ROS than normal cells (15Hagen T.M. Yowe D.L. Bartholomew J.C. Wehr C.M. Do K.L. Park J.Y. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3064-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Moreover, oxidative stress caused by sublethal doses of H2O2 (16Chen Q.M. Bartholomew J.C. Campisi J. Acosta M. Reagan J.D. Ames B.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) or hyperoxia (17von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Docke W. Lotze C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) can force human fibroblasts to arrest in a senescent-like fashion (18Chen Q. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Overexpression of antioxidant genes such as superoxide dismutase or catalase and the maintenance of cell cultures in low oxygen environment extend lifespan (13Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 21Parkes T.L. Elia A.J. Dickinson D. Hilliker A.J. Phillips J.P. Boulianne G.L. Nat.

All of these results point to a strong correlation between telomere dysfunction and senescence, as well as between oxidative damage and senescence. Growth beyond the senescence checkpoint correlates with genetic lesions that interfere with one or more key cellular mortality pathways, most prominently Myc, Rb, and p53 (23Bishop J.M. Eilers M. Katzen A.L. Kornberg T. Ramsay G. Schirm S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 24Shay J.W. Pereira-Smith O.M. Wright W.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the findings that either activation of oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressor function is necessary to override the repression of telomerase in primary somatic cells. The c-myc oncogene has been implicated in the regulation of telomerase through its ability to induce the transcriptional activation of hTERT (25Wang J. Ying Xie L. Allan S. Beach D. Hannon G.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1769-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 26Wu K.J. Grandori C. Amacker M. Simon-Vermot N. Polack A. Lingner J. Dalla-Favera R. Nat.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). By using melanoma-derived clones expressing low levels of c-Myc, we recently demonstrated that telomerase plays a critical role in the c-Myc-dependent tumorigenicity (28Biroccio A. Amodei S. Benassi B. Scarsella M. Cianciulli A. Mottolese M. Del Bufalo D. Leonetti C. Zupi G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that the down-regulation of c-Myc decreases the intracellular glutathione (GSH) content, resulting in apoptosis (29Biroccio A. Benassi B. Filomeni G. Amodei S. Marchini S. Chiorino G. Rotilio G. Zupi G. Ciriolo M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43763-43770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this paper we found that GSH depletion and telomere loss induced by c-Myc down-regulation cause the growth arrest of M14 human melanoma cells. Cell Culture—The stable transfectants expressing low levels of c-Myc protein (MAS51, MAS53, and MAS57) and the control clone (MN2) were previously obtained by transfecting M14 parental line with an expression vector carrying antisense c-myc cDNA and/or a neomicine selection marker gene (30Biroccio A. Benassi B. Amodei S. Gabellini C. Del Bufalo D. Zupi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The M14-derived doxycycline-inducible clones expressing either low c-Myc or the puromycin resistance gene were recently obtained by a double transfection with a commercial inducible TET-ON gene expression system (Clontech) consisting of two expression vectors, one a regulator and the other a response vector carrying c-myc cDNA in antisense orientation or only the selected marker (29Biroccio A. Benassi B. Filomeni G. Amodei S. Marchini S. Chiorino G. Rotilio G. Zupi G. Ciriolo M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43763-43770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Doxycycline (Dox; 1 μg/ml) was administered every 24 h either in the clone carrying the empty vector (control clone) or in the c-Myc transfectant. The M14-derived stable transfectants expressing low levels of telomerase activity (MDN2, MDN4, and MDN16) and the control clone (MV3) were previously obtained by transfecting the dominant negative form of hTERT (DN-hTERT) cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Weinberg) or the puromycin resistance gene only (28Biroccio A. Amodei S. Benassi B. Scarsella M. Cianciulli A. Mottolese M. Del Bufalo D. Leonetti C. Zupi G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Serial cell cultivation was done plaiting 105 cells on 6-cm-diameter dishes; 5 days later the total number of cells in the dish were counted, and 105 cells were replated again. This procedure was repeated for 18 in vitro passages. The increase in population doubling level (ΔPDL) was calculated according to the formula (ΔPDL = log(nf /n 0)/log2, where n 0 is the initial number of cells, and nf is the final number of cells. 5mm N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC; Sigma) or 1 mm l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO; Sigma), doses with no toxic effect on cell survival, were used. According to the different experiments, NAC or BSO was added to the culture 24 h after plating and left in the medium for 24 h. The cells were then washed and incubated with fresh medium for 4 days. This procedure was repeated every culture passage. Intracellular GSH content was measured by a colorimetric assay (Bioxytech GSH-400; Oxis International, Inc., Portland, OR), as described by the manufacturer. Morphological Analysis—Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining was performed as described by Dimri et al. (2Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5788) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in phosphatebuffered saline for 5 min at room temperature, washed in phosphatebuffered saline, and incubated for several hours in staining solution: 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal), 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 2 mm MgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.0. The nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 22358, and cells were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope. Detection of apoptosis was performed in cytospin preparation by terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay using the ApopDETEK in situ apoptosis detection kit (Enzo Diagnostic, New York, NY) as previously reported (28Biroccio A. Amodei S. Benassi B. Scarsella M. Cianciulli A. Mottolese M. Del Bufalo D. Leonetti C. Zupi G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by microscopic examination of TUNEL-treated slide at ×200. For each slide, five fields were examined, and 100 cells in each field were counted. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Cell percentages in the different phases of cell cycle were measured by flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained nuclei as previously described (31Citro G. D'Agnano I. Leonetti C. Perini R. Bucci B. Zon G. Calabretta B. Zupi G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 283-289PubMed Google Scholar) using CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The percentage of cells synthesizing DNA was measured by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson) using bromodeoxyuridin (BrdU; Becton Dickinson) incorporation, as previously described (30Biroccio A. Benassi B. Amodei S. Gabellini C. Del Bufalo D. Zupi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were labeled with BrdU at a final concentration of 10 μm for 24 h, and the analysis was carried out at the end of BrdU labeling. The cells were then incubated with 2 μg/ml of mouse anti-BrdU (clone BMC 9318; Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at room temperature, and the BrdU-positive cells were revealed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse monoclonal antibody (1:20; Dako, SA, Glostrup, Denmark). For ROS content, adherent cells were first assayed for viability and then incubated with 4 μm dihydroethidium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min at 37 °C. After incubation, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Western Blot—Western blot and detection were performed as previously reported (30Biroccio A. Benassi B. Amodei S. Gabellini C. Del Bufalo D. Zupi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 μg of total proteins were loaded on denaturing SDS-PAGE. Immunodetection of c-Myc and hTERT proteins was performed by using mouse anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody (clone 9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:1000 dilution) and rabbit anti-hTERT polyclonal antibody (clone L-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100 dilution). To check the amount of proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, β-actin was used as control. The relative amounts of the transferred proteins were quantified by scanning the autoradiographic films with a gel densitometer scanner (Bio-Rad) and normalized to the related β-actin amounts. Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP)—Telomerase enzyme activity was measured with the PCR-based TRAP kit (Intergen Company, Oxford, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To define the sensitivity of the method and the semi-quantitative relationship between protein concentration and ladder band intensity, different amounts of protein extract (from 0.01 to 2 μg) were used for each cell line and for all assays. In all cases, the reaction products were amplified in the presence of a 36-bp internal TRAP assay standard, and each extract was tested for heat sensitivity. Each set of TRAP assay included a control reaction without extract. Southern Blot—Total DNA was isolated using the standard procedure. For each sample, 15 μg of DNA were digested with 40 units of Hinf1 and electrophoresed on 0.8% agarose gel. DNA was denatured, neutralized, transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N; Amersham Biosciences), and cross-linked with ultraviolet light. The membrane was hybridized with 5′-end [γ-32P]deoxyadenosine triphosphate-labeled telomeric oligonucleotide probe (TTAGGG)3 at 42 °C for 2 h in a rapid hybridization buffer (QuikHyb hybridization solution; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After washing, the filters were autoradiographed (Hyperfilm-MP; Amersham Biosciences) with an intensifying screen at –80 °C for 24 h. The autoradiographs were scanned, and the mean telomere length was calculated as reported by Harley et al. (32Harley C.B. Fucher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4665) Google Scholar). Cytogenetic Analysis—To obtain chromosome preparation, the cells were incubated with 0.1 μg/ml colcemid for 1 h and trypsinized, then incubated with hypotonic 0.075 m KCl for 20 min, fixed with methanol to acetic acid (3:1 v/v), dropped onto frosted microscope slides, and air-dried overnight. End-to-end fusions were evaluated in at least 50 Giemsa-stained metaphases from two simultaneously grown cultures for each line and each treatment. For all the experiments, metaphase preparations of the different cells were performed simultaneously under the same conditions. The χ2 test was used for statistical analysis. c-Myc Down-regulation Causes Growth Arrest of M14 Melanoma Cells—We previously generated stable M14 melanoma transfectants expressing low levels of c-Myc compared with control cells (30Biroccio A. Benassi B. Amodei S. Gabellini C. Del Bufalo D. Zupi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). By using these transfectants, we here observed that, starting from culture passage 7, their growth rate slowed down, and then they stopped proliferating. In contrast, the growth kinetic of control cells was unabated (Fig. 1A). This effect was accompanied by a reduction of BrdU incorporation (Fig. 1B); although control cells maintained a high and stable labeling with BrdU (approximately 100%), BrdU-positive cells decreased from approximately 90% to less than 10% in the c-Myc transfectants with the increasing of culture passages. To demonstrate the specific role of c-Myc in this phenomenon, a M14-derived Dox-inducible c-Myc low expressing clone, recently generated (29Biroccio A. Benassi B. Filomeni G. Amodei S. Marchini S. Chiorino G. Rotilio G. Zupi G. Ciriolo M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43763-43770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was used. As previously reported, after 72 h of Dox administration, the cells showed a reduction of c-Myc protein level by approximately 60% compared with uninduced cells. Decreased c-Myc protein expression following Dox administration caused a growth arrest during the in vitro passages (Fig. 2). On the contrary, control cells showed no change in growth. When Dox was removed in the Dox-induced cells, they exhibited a growth rate similar to that of uninduced cells or the control clone, from the eighth passage onwards. Consistent with this result, c-Myc expression (Fig. 2, inset) was lower in the Dox-induced cells than in the uninduced or control clone, and it increased following Dox withdrawal. Dox-induced cells showed distinctive cell characteristics associated with crisis. As cells passaged, a progressively increased expression of SA-β-gal activity was observed in Dox-induced cells, whereas a negligible amount was found in uninduced cells (Fig. 3A). Moreover, although no alteration in phenotypic characteristics was observed in uninduced and Dox-induced cells at early passages, induced cells became enlarged, often contained multiple nuclei, and had a vacuolated cytoplasm from the eighth passage onwards (Fig. 3B, panel a). Cell cycle analysis revealed elevated forward and side scatters, which reflect increased cell size and granularity (Fig. 3B, panel b), and a cell cycle profile substantially altered (Fig. 3B, panel c). A significant decrease in the percentage of cells in G1 phase was observed, which was the major factor contributing to a reduced ratio of G1 to G2/M cells. Staining of nuclei with Hoechst showed that cells contained multiple or multi-lobulated nuclei (Fig. 3B, panel d). These morphological characteristics predominated until day 5 of culture, and then apoptosis appeared (Fig. 3B, panel e). TUNEL staining detected an increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells with the increasing of culture passages, TUNEL-positive cells reaching 60% at the tenth in vitro passage. c-Myc-induced Crisis Is Associated with an Impairment of Telomerase Function and Alteration of Intracellular Redox State—hTERT expression, telomerase activity, and telomere length were analyzed as functions of long term passage in culture. Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A), a semi-quantitative TRAP assay (Fig. 4B), and terminal restriction fragment (TRF; Fig. 4C) were performed in uninduced and Dox-induced c-Myc transfectant after four, eight, and ten in vitro passages. It is evident that hTERT protein expression and telomerase activity were repressed in the Dox-induced cells compared with control cells. The decreased hTERT expression and telomerase activity were evident at the fourth passage, and they were unabated as cells passaged. Consistent with a reduction of telomerase activity, progressive telomere shortening occurred. As shown in Fig. 4C, TRFs length ranged from approximately 12 to 6 kb, with a mean length of approximately 8 kb in control cells. In contrast, in Dox-induced cells TRFs were significantly shorter already after 4 in vitro passages, ranging from 9 to 3 kb with a mean length of approximately 6 kb, and it reached a mean length of approximately 4 kb at the tenth passage. c-Myc-induced crisis was also associated with alteration in the intracellular redox state. As reported in Fig. 4D, the value of GSH in Dox-induced cells was significantly lower (p < 0.01) than control cells. As a consequence, a significant increase in ROS production was observed (Fig. 4E). The measure of reactive oxygen species revealed that although no change in ROS content was evident in uninduced cells, approximately 30% of ROS was already found after four in vitro passages, and this percentage remained unchanged as cells passaged. Restoration of Intracellular Glutathione Content Allows c-Myc Low Expressing Cells to Escape from Crisis—To determine whether the alteration of redox state influenced the c-Myc-dependent crisis, intracellular GSH content was normalized between control and c-Myc low expressing cells. In particular, control cells were treated with BSO, a specific inhibitor of GSH synthesis, to decrease the GSH levels, and in the opposite experiments, GSH levels were increased in the Dox-induced c-Myc cells by adding NAC, which is known to provide cysteine precursor for GSH synthesis. As shown in the Fig. 5A, the intracellular GSH content was significantly reduced in BSO-treated cells to levels comparable with c-Myc low expressing cells. Nevertheless, BSO-treated cells continued to proliferate, and the growth kinetic showed no change compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5B). NAC treatment of the c-Myc low expressing cells raised their GSH levels to those found in the controls (Fig. 5A), enabling the treated cells to continue proliferating, in contrast to the untreated cells (Fig. 5B). Moreover, NAC-treated cells escaped from crisis at late culture passages (Fig. 5C). In fact, the simultaneous analysis of SA-β-gal-positive and polinucleated cells revealed no significant difference between untreated and NAC-treated c-Myc transfectant at passage 8, the percentage of SA-β-gal-positive and polinucleated cells being approximately 40 and 10%, respectively, in all cells, regardless NAC treatment. On the contrary, as cells passaged, the difference between untreated and NAC-treated cells in terms of SA-β-gal-positive and polinucleated percentages became evident. In fact, whereas approximately 60% of SA-β-gal-positive cells were evident in the untreated cells at passage 10, a reduction by approximately 70% was revealed in the NAC-treated cells, and only a minimal presence of SA-β-gal activity existed at passage 18. Similarly, NAC treatment was able to significantly decrease the percentage of cells with supernumerary nuclei by approximately 75%, the percentage of polinucleated cells being approximately 25 and 5% in untreated and NAC-treated cells, respectively. In addition, the percentage of SA-β-gal-positive and polinucleated cells in NAC-treated cells at passage 18 was similar to that observed in control cells. Glutathione Depletion Cooperates with Telomerase Dysfunction in Inducing Crisis—To test the hypothesis that oxidative stress could cooperate with telomerase dysfunction in the c-Myc-dependent crisis, we directly inhibited telomerase function and GSH levels. To this aim, an experimental model previously generated (28Biroccio A. Amodei S. Benassi B. Scarsella M. Cianciulli A. Mottolese M. Del Bufalo D. Leonetti C. Zupi G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and consisting of three clones expressing a catalytically inactive DN-hTERT and a control clone expressing the puromycin gene only, was used. We first evaluated the effect of telomerase inhibition on growth properties (Fig. 6A). The growth kinetic of cells carrying a control retrovirus vector did not differ from those of parental cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, following DN-hTERT introduction, the cells displayed many characteristics of crisis, similar to what had been observed after c-Myc down-regulation (Figs. 1, 2, 3). In fact, as shown in Fig. 6B, the percentage of SA-β-gal cells in DN-hTERT cells progressively increased with the culture passages, reaching a value of approximately 70% at passage 14, whereas it remained lower than 5% in control cells. As expected, DN-hTERT cells showed a reduction of telomerase activity by approximately seven times lower than control cells and telomere shortening (Fig. 6, C and D). On the contrary, no change in either c-Myc protein or intracellular GSH content was observed between control and DN-hTERT cells (Fig. 6, E and F). To demonstrate a cooperative effect between oxidative stress and telomerase dysfunction, the intracellular GSH content was decreased in the DN-hTERT cells, and the growth kinetics of untreated and BSO-treated cells were monitored. BSO treatment in DN-hTERT cells reduced the intracellular GSH content (Fig. 7A) to a level comparable with c-Myc transfectant (Fig. 5A) and accelerated the growth arrest induced by the inhibition of hTERT function (Fig. 7B). In fact, although DN-hTERT cells stopped proliferating after 16 culture passages, the BSO-treated cells had undergone growth arrest six passages before. These data were even more apparent from the analysis of SA-β-gal-positive and polinucleated cells evalua"

To reveal the physiological function of cTPx II in yeast cell growth, we searched for proteins which react with cTPx II. In this study, we identified a novel interaction between cTPx II and CSR1p using the yeast two-hybrid system. CSR1p (SFH2p) has been known to be one member of Sec14 homologous (SFH2) proteins. SFH2p exhibits phosphatidylinositol transfer protein activity. Interestingly, we found that cTPx II selectively bound to SFH2p among the five types of SFH proteins and Sec14p. The interaction required the dimerization of cTPx II. In addition, SFH2p also specifically bound to cTPx II among the yeast thiol peroxidase isoforms. The selective interaction of the dimer form of cTPx II (the oxidized form) with SFH2p was also confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays. The growth retardation, clearly reflected by the length of the lag phase, of cTPx IIΔ was rescued by deleting SFH2p in the cTPx IIΔ strain. The SFH2Δ strain did not show any growth retardation. In addition, the double mutant showed a higher susceptibility to oxidative stress. This finding provides the first in vivo demonstration of the specific interaction of cTPx II with SFH2p in an oxidative stress-sensitive manner and a novel physiological function of the complex of cTPx II and SFH2p."
https://openalex.org/W2051164086,"The activity and plasma clearance of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta are known to be regulated by activated alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M*). This has been implicated in pathophysiological processes, but no small molecule compounds have been reported to modulate TGF-beta activity by affecting the interaction of TGF-beta and alpha2M*. Here, we demonstrate that fatty acids are capable of inhibiting complex formation of TGF-beta isoforms and alpha2M* as demonstrated by nondenaturing and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This is dependent on carbon chain length (C20, C18, C16, C14 > C12 > C10), degree of unsaturation (polyunsaturated > saturated), and TGF-beta isoforms (TGF-beta1 > TGF-beta2 > TGF-beta3). Arachidonic acid, which is one of the most potent inhibitors, is also capable of dissociating TGF-beta-alpha2M* complexes, but higher concentrations are required. Arachidonic acid appears to inhibit TGF-beta-alpha2M* complex formation by binding specifically to alpha2M* as demonstrated by gel filtration chromatography. Arachidonic acid reverses the inhibitory effect of alpha2M* on TGF-beta binding, TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition, and TGF-beta-induced transcriptional activation in mink lung epithelial cells and affects plasma clearance of TGF-beta-alpha2M* complexes in mice. These results show that fatty acids are effective modulators of TGF-beta activity and plasma clearance and may be useful in treating human diseases through their effects on the interaction of TGF-beta and alpha2M*."
