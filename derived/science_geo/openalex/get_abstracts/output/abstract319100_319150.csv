https://openalex.org/W2066212383,"Analyses of the total lipids of 11 species of blue-green algae showed a simple but qualitatively variable fatty acid composition. The species can be grouped in three categories on the basis of their oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acid content. One species was unusual in that the ten-carbon acid accounts for one-half of its total fatty acid. Branched chain acids are absent in the algae, but are major components of marine bacteria. The geochemical significance of the data is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2042126260,"The primordial gases of eight unequilibrated ordinary chondrites are strongly fractionated with respect to"" cosmic"" proportions. The absolute amounts are roughly proportional to the degree of disequilibration. Apparently, ordinary chondrites originally contained considerably larger amounts of primordial rare gases."
https://openalex.org/W2006440409,"A crystallographic study of some alkylamine hydrates establishes that these are polyhedral clathrate hy drates. While the simpler alkylamines form hydrates with water structures re lated to those of the gas hydrates or the alkylonium salt hydrates, the di ethylamine and tert-butylamine hydrates have water frameworks forming cages which have not previously been ob served in the clathrate hydrates."
https://openalex.org/W1996356930,The high-pressure metallic phase of aluminunm antimnonide is super conducting [critical temperature T(c) (P approximately 125 kilobars) = 2.8 degrees +/-0.2 degrees K]. This transition temperature is significantly lower than the transition temperature of metallic germanium under an equivalent high pressure. A similar result had been previously found for superconducting indiumantimonide in comparison to tin.

https://openalex.org/W2030645043,"The recent appearance of large populations of certain adult marine mollusks in Bermuda shallows, unreported in previous surveys, suggests that an invasion is taking place, probably from Florida or the Bahamas, or from both. ""Newcomers"" grow to sizes larger than any known elsewhere, suggesting that the characteristically large sizes of some species in Bermuda reflect environmentalrather than genetic causes."

https://openalex.org/W2054517425,"Nature. The proposed national arboretum at Washington would contain a permanent living collection of trees and other outdoor plants for purposes of scientific research and education. It would include the trees, shrubs, and perennials used in forestry and horticulture, and the wild relatives of these plants. It would be a bureau of standards for horticulture. It would contain a water garden and a wildrice preserve, and it would serve incidentally as a bird sanctuary. Economic value. The arboretum would make the work of the Department of Agriculture more valuable to the country in many ways, but especially through plant breeding. The development of faster-growing timber trees, improved fruits, and disease-resistant plants generally, through the facilities afforded by the arboretum, would increase profoundly the agricultural wealth and welfare of the United States. Location. The Mount Hamilton and Hickey Hill tracts in the District of Columbia, together with the Anacostia River flats above Benning Bridge, constitute an admirable site for the arboretum, convenient in location and with a great variety of soils. Cost. About 400 acres of the proposed site is already owned by the government. It consists of marsh land, about to be drained by army engineers. The Mount Hamilton and Hickey Hill area, 408 acres, privately owned, was reported by the assessor in January, 1925, to be valued at $343,048, distributed among thirty owners. Maintenance. If the purchase of the Mount Hamilton and Hickey Hill tracts in the fiscal year 1927 is authorized, it is estimated that the cost of maintenance of the arboretum for the first three years would be as follows: 1927. Nothing 1928. $25,000 1929. $50,000."
