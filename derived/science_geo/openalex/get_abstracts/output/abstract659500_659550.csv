https://openalex.org/W3083820674,"Determining protein levels in each tissue and how they compare with RNA levels is important for understanding human biology and disease as well as regulatory processes that control protein levels. We quantified the relative protein levels from over 12,000 genes across 32 normal human tissues. Tissue-specific or tissue-enriched proteins were identified and compared to transcriptome data. Many ubiquitous transcripts are found to encode tissue-specific proteins. Discordance of RNA and protein enrichment revealed potential sites of synthesis and action of secreted proteins. The tissue-specific distribution of proteins also provides an in-depth view of complex biological events that require the interplay of multiple tissues. Most importantly, our study demonstrated that protein tissue-enrichment information can explain phenotypes of genetic diseases, which cannot be obtained by transcript information alone. Overall, our results demonstrate how understanding protein levels can provide insights into regulation, secretome, metabolism, and human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3085616253,"Exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication and metastatic progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, cellular communication between heterogeneous HCC cells with different metastatic potentials and the resultant cancer progression are not fully understood in HCC. Here, HCC cells with high-metastatic capacity (97hm and Huhm) were constructed by continually exerting selective pressure on primary HCC cells (MHCC-97H and Huh7). Through performing exosomal miRNA sequencing in HCC cells with different metastatic potentials (MHCC-97H and 97hm), many significantly different miRNA candidates were found. Among these miRNAs, miR-92a-3p was the most abundant miRNA in the exosomes of highly metastatic HCC cells. Exosomal miR92a-3p was also found enriched in the plasma of HCC patient-derived xenograft mice (PDX) model with high-metastatic potential. Exosomal miR-92a-3p promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in recipient cancer cells via targeting PTEN and regulating its downstream Akt/Snail signaling. Furthermore, through mRNA sequencing in HCC cells with different metastatic potentials and predicting potential transcription factors of miR92a-3p, upregulated transcript factors E2F1 and c-Myc were found in high-metastatic HCC cells promote the expression of cellular and exosomal miR-92a-3p in HCC by directly binding the promoter of its host gene, miR17HG. Clinical data showed that a high plasma exosomal miR92a-3p level was correlated with shortened overall survival and disease-free survival, indicating poor prognosis in HCC patients. In conclusion, hepatoma-derived exosomal miR92a-3p plays a critical role in the EMT progression and promoting metastasis by inhibiting PTEN and activating Akt/Snail signaling. Exosomal miR92a-3p is a potential predictive biomarker for HCC metastasis, and this may provoke the development of novel therapeutic and preventing strategies against metastasis of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W3083837615,"Summary Metabolic reprogramming is a key feature of many cancers, but how and when it contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming induced by mitochondrial fusion can be rate-limiting for immortalization of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and trigger their irreversible dedication to tumorigenesis. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we find that Drosophila brain tumors contain a rapidly dividing stem cell population defined by upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). We combine targeted metabolomics and in vivo genetic screening to demonstrate that OxPhos is required for tumor cell immortalization but dispensable in neural stem cells (NSCs) giving rise to tumors. Employing an in vivo NADH/NAD+ sensor, we show that NSCs precisely increase OxPhos during immortalization. Blocking OxPhos or mitochondrial fusion stalls TICs in quiescence and prevents tumorigenesis through impaired NAD+ regeneration. Our work establishes a unique connection between cellular metabolism and immortalization of tumor-initiating cells."
https://openalex.org/W3086361893,"Classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has spread to Bangladesh since early March of 2020, and people are getting daily updates from the social and electronic media. We aimed at assessing the prevalence of anxiety among Bangladeshi people during the pandemic in connection with social media exposure (SME) and electronic media exposure (EME). For this cross-sectional study, data were collected from 880 participants by a self-administered online-based questionnaire relating personal characteristics, self-rate health (SRH), SME, and EME with anxiety. Findings show that around half of the surveyed population experienced a spike of anxiety (49.1%) during the pandemic, ten times higher than the national anxiety rate in 2019. The participants with an increased SME of over four hours per day experienced a higher level of anxiety than individuals with < = 2 hours exposure to social media. Similarly, the anxiety was higher among people with fair/bad SRH compared to individuals with excellent SRH. It is highly recommended to develop active surveillance and effective monitoring systems to reduce the spread of misinformation from both social and electronic media to improve the state of mental health conditions during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3084493912,"New technological solutions play an important role in preventing the spread of Covid-19. Many countries have implemented tracking applications or other surveillance systems, which may raise concerns about privacy and civil rights violations but may be also perceived by citizens as a way to reduce threat and uncertainty. Our research examined whether feelings evoked by the pandemic (perceived threat and lack of control) as well as more stable ideological views predict the acceptance of such technologies. In two studies conducted in Poland, we found that perceived personal threat and lack of personal control were significantly positively related to the acceptance of surveillance technologies, but their predictive value was smaller than that of individual differences in authoritarianism and endorsement of liberty. Moreover, we found that the relationship between the acceptance of surveillance technologies and both perceived threat and lack of control was particularly strong among people high in authoritarianism. Our research shows that the negative feelings evoked by the unprecedented global crisis may inspire positive attitudes towards helpful but controversial surveillance technologies but that they do so to a lesser extent than ideological beliefs."
https://openalex.org/W3024701495,"India locked down 1.3 billion people on March 25, 2020 in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. The economic cost of it was estimated at USD 98 billion, while the social costs are still unknown. This study investigated how government formed reactive policies to fight coronavirus across its policy sectors. Primary data was collected from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) in the form press releases of government plans, policies, programme initiatives and achievements. A text corpus of 260,852 words was created from 396 documents from the PIB. An unsupervised machine-based topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was performed on the text corpus. It was done to extract high probability topics in the policy sectors. The interpretation of the extracted topics was made through a nudge theoretic lens to derive the critical policy heuristics of the government. Results showed that most interventions were targeted to generate endogenous nudge by using external triggers. Notably, the nudges from the Prime Minister of India was critical in creating herd effect on lockdown and social distancing norms across the nation. A similar effect was also observed around the public health (e.g., masks in public spaces; Yoga and Ayurveda for immunity), transport (e.g., old trains converted to isolation wards), micro, small and medium enterprises (e.g., rapid production of PPE and masks), science and technology sector (e.g., diagnostic kits, robots and nano-technology), home affairs (e.g., surveillance and lockdown), urban (e.g. drones, GIS-tools) and education (e.g., online learning). A conclusion was drawn on leveraging these heuristics are crucial for lockdown easement planning."

Here, we demonstrate that a specific transcriptomically identified population of mouse VIP+ SCN neurons is active at the “wrong” time of day—nighttime—when most SCN neurons are silent. Using chemogenetic and optogenetic strategies, we show that these neurons and their cellular clocks are necessary and sufficient to gate and time nighttime sleep but have no effect upon daytime sleep. We propose that mouse nighttime sleep, analogous to the human siesta, is a “hard-wired” property gated by specific neurons of the master clock to favor subsequent alertness prior to dawn (a circadian “wake maintenance zone”).

Thus, the SCN is not simply a 24-h metronome: specific populations sculpt critical features of the sleep-wake cycle. Almost all organisms have internal circadian clocks that consolidate sleep to night in diurnal organisms or day in nocturnal ones. Sleep duration and intensity are additionally regulated by a homeostatic mechanism dependent upon prior waking experience (Borbély, 1982Borbély A.A. A two process model of sleep regulation.Hum. Neurobiol. 1982; 1: 195-204PubMed Google Scholar). Within this two-process model, it remains unclear to what extent the circadian clock acts as a “metronome”—indicating day and night—versus acting as an “orchestral conductor”—specifically shaping features of the sleep-wake cycle. Most animal species and all human cultures consolidate the majority of sleep to either day or night. Many also exhibit an additional period of sleep—a “siesta”—during the second half of the wake phase, followed by a period of increased alertness—the “wake maintenance zone” (WMZ)—thought to depend on sleep pressure (Ehlen et al., 2015Ehlen J.C.

Rhythms. 2014; 29: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). How the mammalian circadian oscillator shapes this complex pattern is unknown. The molecular basis of circadian behavior is based on transcription-translation feedback loops that oscillate every 24 h. Molecular rhythms in peripheral cells are entrained by a central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) 20,000 neurons at the base of the hypothalamus (Brown and Azzi, 2013Brown S.A. Azzi A. Peripheral circadian oscillators in mammals.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2013; : 45-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Overall, SCN neurons are most electrically active during the day; in mice, this correlates with periods of quiescence and sleep (Belle et al., 2009Belle M.D. Diekman C.O. Forger D.B. Piggins H.D.

Although all SCN neurons contain the same molecular clock, anatomically distinct regions of the SCN—a ventral “core” expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and a dorsal “shell” expressing arginine vasopressin (AVP) (Varadarajan et al., 2018Varadarajan S. Tajiri M. Jain R. Holt R. Ahmed Q. LeSauter J. Silver R.

Come together, right...now: synchronization of rhythms in a mammalian circadian clock.Neuron. 2005; 48: 531-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), a pattern thought to be important for enabling clock plasticity encoding seasonality and day length (Azzi et al., 2014Azzi A. Dallmann R. Casserly A. Rehrauer H. Patrignani A. Maier B. Kramer A. Brown S.A. Circadian behavior is light-reprogrammed by plastic DNA methylation.Nat.

Dynamic interactions mediated by nonredundant signaling mechanisms couple circadian clock neurons.Neuron. 2013; 80: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that different oscillator populations within the SCN track dawn and dusk and drive distinct peaks of behavioral activity: the morning (M) and evening (E) oscillator model (Pittendrigh and Daan, 1976Pittendrigh C. Daan S. A functional analysis of circadian pacemakers in nocturnal rodents. V. Pacemaker structure: a clock for all seasons.J. Comp. Physiol. A Neuroethol. Sens. Neural Behav. Physiol. 1976; 106: 333-355Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Supporting this idea, in Drosophila, distinct groups of clock neurons display phases of electrical activity that anticipate dawn or dusk and promote M or E locomotor activity, respectively (Grima et al., 2004Grima B. Chélot E. Xia R. Rouyer F.

Agosto J. Rosbash M. Coupled oscillators control morning and evening locomotor behaviour of Drosophila.Nature. 2004; 431: 862-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), while other populations of clock neurons regulate sleep timing (Guo et al., 2016Guo F. Yu J. Jung H.J. Abruzzi K.C. Luo W. Griffith L.C. Rosbash M.

PDF cells are a GABA-responsive wake-promoting component of the Drosophila sleep circuit.Neuron. 2008; 60: 672-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). So far, little behavioral evidence exists to support this idea in mammals, though the overall “firing window” of SCN neurons expands or contracts with changing day length (VanderLeest et al., 2007VanderLeest H.T. Houben T. Michel S. Deboer T. Albus H. Vansteensel M.J. Block G.D. Meijer J.H. Seasonal encoding by the circadian pacemaker of the SCN.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 468-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that a specific population of mouse VIP+SCN neurons is active at the “wrong” time of day—nighttime when most SCN neurons are silent—and is necessary and sufficient to gate nighttime sleep but has no effect on daytime sleep. In turn, the molecular clock within these neurons determines the specific timing of this nighttime sleep (a rodent “siesta”) and subsequent alertness prior to dawn (a circadian WMZ). Thus, the SCN is not just a metronome for 24 h rhythms but micromanages critical features of the sleep-wake cycle. Mouse running wheel (RW) behavior under 12:12 light:dark (LD) cycles includes 3 major time-of-day-dependent features: (1) a prolonged early-night activity peak starting just prior to dark onset at zeitgeber time (ZT)12, (2) a siesta (a period of quiescence and sleep) centered around ZT20, and (3) a second bout of activity anticipating lights on at ZT0 (Figures 1A and 1B ). Although the SCN is most electrically active during the day (Colwell, 2011Colwell C.S. Linking neural activity and molecular oscillations in the SCN.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 553-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), for the SCN clock to control nighttime activity we hypothesized, some SCN neurons would be electrically active during one or more of these nighttime events. We therefore quantified SCN neuron electrical activity at six time points by immunostaining for the immediate-early protein c-FOS, a marker of neural activity (Schilling et al., 1991Schilling K. Luk D. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Regulation of a fos-lacZ fusion gene: a paradigm for quantitative analysis of stimulus-transcription coupling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1991; 88: 5665-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). Consistent with previous reports, significantly more neurons express c-FOS during the day than during the night (Colwell, 2011Colwell C.S. Linking neural activity and molecular oscillations in the SCN.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 12: 553-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). However, populations of presumably active c-FOS-expressing neurons were identifiable at night in both dorsal and ventral regions of the SCN, albeit in lower numbers than during the day (Figure 1C). Interestingly, there appeared to be two peaks of firing, with the first (major) peak corresponding to the peak of daytime sleep and a second roughly corresponding to the peak of nighttime sleep (the siesta). To characterize night-active SCN neurons in more detail, we placed SCN slices on a multi-electrode array (MEA), allowing recording of unit activity over time (Figure S1A). We maintained individual SCN slices on the MEA for 9–10 h, recording for 10 min/h, and then identified and sorted spikes by waveform to identify active units—individual neurons or electrically similar groups of neurons—at each time point. Although only ∼16/59 electrodes contacted the SCN, 2/3 of all detected units came from within the SCN, with the main peak of SCN unit firing preceded firing from extra-SCN units by ∼2 h (Figure S1B). During the day (ZT0–12), we detected 177 units active at one or more time points (3 experiments), with the highest number of active units detected between ∼ZT5 and ZT8, during the daytime sleep period. At night (ZT16–24), we detected 77 active units across 3 experiments. Figure 1D shows these data as a proportionally compressed composite view, trimmed to eliminate overlapping recordings. (An expanded view of night-active neurons is shown in Figure S1C, representative recordings are in Figure S1D, and a composite sorting of all units is in Figure S1E.) About 15% of night-active units (16/106; 4 experiments) were firing for the duration of the recording (“always on”), and ∼40% (40/106) were active for a brief period at one or more time points (“sporadic”). Both of these were equally distributed between the dorsal and ventral SCNs. Of the remainder, a further ∼20% (21/106) became active toward the end of the siesta and continued to fire to the end of the night (∼ZT21–24), coincident with the second RW activity peak; these “2nd peak” active units were predominantly dorsal SCN neurons, consistent with previous reports of AVP+SCN neuronal activity at this time (Gizowski et al., 2016Gizowski C. Zaelzer C. Bourque C.W. Clock-driven vasopressin neurotransmission mediates anticipatory thirst prior to sleep.Nature. 2016; 537: 685-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The remaining ∼25%, (25/106) were, by far, the most active, with a period of activity coincident with nighttime (siesta) sleep (∼ZT18–22): an expanded heatmap showing these units is in Figure S1C. These “siesta” active units were predominantly ventral (Figure 1D, right panel). As the ventral core region of the SCN is defined by VIP expression, we looked for co-expression of VIP and c-FOS at ZT18, around the beginning of the siesta (Figure 1E). Consistent with our previous results, roughly two thirds of c-FOS-positive neurons at ZT18 were VIPergic (Figure 1E). We next determined whether siesta-active neurons fired only during the siesta or were also active along with the majority of SCN neurons during the light period. Strikingly, most siesta-active neurons were siesta specific: of 27 siesta-active units, 21 were active only during the siesta (Figure S1F). Another 6 units showed an on-off-on pattern, beginning to fire again at the start of the next day, but even these fired more vigorously during the siesta (Figure S1G). To further investigate night-active SCN neurons, we recorded electrical activity from randomly selected SCN neurons around the clock by patch clamp: Figure 1F shows all recorded neurons in a 3D graph, and Figure S2 shows individual neuron characteristics. As previously reported (Belle et al., 2009Belle M.D. Diekman C.O. Forger D.B. Piggins H.D. Daily electrical silencing in the mammalian circadian clock.Science. 2009; 326: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we found SCN neurons that were firing (active cells) and two classes of inactive neurons: one hyperpolarized class with a resting membrane potential (RMP) ≤ −45 mV and a second depolarized population with a RMP ≥ −30 mV. (We injected current to repolarize each depolarized cell and verify that it could fire normal healthy action potentials.) Scoring for the time when neuronal activity was recorded, two peaks of firing were again observed: one during the day and one during the night, with equal RMP and firing frequency (Figures 1F and S2A–S2C). The majority of night-active neurons were visible during the siesta period (Figure S2D). To better characterize night-active SCN neurons, we used c-FOS::GFP transgenic mice (Reijmers et al., 2007Reijmers L.G. Perkins B.L. Matsuo N. Mayford M. Localization of a stable neural correlate of associative memory.Science. 2007; 317: 1230-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), where sustained neuronal activity induces GFP expression for a ∼3 h window. We took SCN slices from c-FOS::GFP mice to be ready to examine from ZT15 (∼2 h prior to siesta onset), identified GFP+ neurons throughout the siesta, recorded electrical activity in these different neurons by patch clamp, and then collected the cell contents of these neurons and characterized their transcriptomes by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq; Figure 2A). First, we examined neuropeptide expression relative to time of collection of each active neuron. As predicted, VIP is predominantly expressed in siesta-active neurons compared to pre-siesta-active neurons (Figure 2B). Since one limitation of scRNA-seq is that all expressed genes are not detected in each library, we characterized each neuron by matching transcriptomes against the recently published scRNA-seq atlas of SCN neurons (Wen et al., 2020Wen S. Ma D. Zhao M. Xie L. Wu Q. Gou L. Zhu C. Fan Y. Wang H. Yan J. Spatiotemporal single-cell analysis of gene expression in the mouse suprachiasmatic nucleus.Nat. Neurosci. 2020; 23: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) to classify their type (prediction scores are shown in Table S1; see STAR Methods). From 20 ventral c-FOS::GFP+ SCN neurons, we identified two classes of night-active neurons within the SCN: a vip+ nms+ population (n = 9) and an avp+ nms+ population (n = 10), as well as a single vip+ grp+ neuron (Figure 2C). As expected, ∼75% of c-FOS::GFP+ neurons were electrically active at the time of collection (Figures 2D and 2E; c-FOS::GFP expression in non-active neurons likely represents recent prior electrical activity; see Table S2 for electrophysiological properties). Interestingly, avp+ nms+ SCN neurons were all collected in the early night (∼ZT15–16, during the first peak of RW activity), while vip+ nms+ neurons were collected toward the end of the night (∼ZT17–20, approximately the time of the siesta). These data suggest strongly that nighttime-active vip+ nms+ neurons are firing during the siesta, while avp+ nms+ nighttime-active neuronal activity precedes it. Given that avp+ and vip+ SCN neurons are active at different times of night (Figure 2E), we hypothesized that each population could regulate different aspects of nighttime behavior. To test this, we measured the contribution of each subset of SCN neurons to RW activity using three strains of mice bred into a homogeneous C57bl6 background: Vip-CRE to target VIPergic neurons (Taniguchi et al., 2011Taniguchi H.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2610-2621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, >90% of mice displayed a robust nighttime siesta in the presence of a RW; only mice displaying a daily siesta were used for subsequent experiments. Mice were injected at the SCN with either control or an AAV.Flex.TetLC virus (Adeno-associated virus) encoding tetanus toxin light chain (TetLC) in reverse orientation between loxP sites (Foster et al., 2015Foster E. Wildner H. Tudeau L. Haueter S. Ralvenius W.T. Jegen M. Johannssen H. Hösli L. Haenraets K. Ghanem A. et al.Targeted ablation, silencing, and activation establish glycinergic dorsal horn neurons as key components of a spinal gate for pain and itch.Neuron. 2015; 85: 1289-1304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Using this intersectional approach, in the presence of CRE, TetLC is flipped into the correct orientation and transcribed, blocking synaptic transmission (Figure S4A). We then compared RW activity in 12-h:12-h LD conditions for each mouse in the week prior to injection to RW activity in the week starting ∼14 days post-injection, allowing TetLC to be fully expressed in VIP+SCN neurons (hereinafter abbreviated VIP>), AVP+SCN neurons (AVP>) or the entire SCN (Syt10>). Injection of AAV.Flex.TetLC into the SCN after mice have reached adulthood eliminates the possibility of developmental defects caused by silencing VIP neurons, although we cannot rule out unknown compensatory mechanisms occurring after silencing. Control-injected mice showed no differences in distribution of activity pre- and post-injection (Figures 3C and S4C). AVP>TetLC mice showed a significant increase in RW activity from ZT12–18 post-injection, suggesting that AVP neurons may contribute to daily activity in the early night; however, siesta behavior was unaffected (Figures 3A and 3C), consistent with avp+ nms+ SCN neurons being active in the early night only (Figure 2E). By contrast, VIP>TetLC disrupted the daily siesta, consistent with the late night activity of vip+ nms+ SCN neurons (Figure 2E): the only significant effect of blocking VIP+SCN signaling was to increase RW activity from ZT18.5–22 (Figure 3B). Furthermore, the timing of the siesta, as determined by the time of lowest RW activity in each mouse at ZT18–23 was delayed by ∼2 h in VIP>TetLC mice compared to that in controls or AVP>TetLC mice (Figure 3C). An example VIP>TetLC actogram is shown in Figure S4B; individual mice where VIP+SCN activity is silenced no longer show a defined period of quiescence and, instead, display random bouts of activity and inactivity across the latter half of the night. It should be noted that, although TetLC blocks synaptic transmission (VIP>TetLC caused a significant decrease in electrical activity within VIP+SCN neurons; Figure S4E), it does not affect the release of neuropeptides stored in dense core vesicles. Thus, the neuropeptide VIP itself may still be released, and we observe no changes in circadian period in VIP>TetLC mice (data not shown), unlike in vip−/− mutants (Aton et al., 2005Aton S.J. Colwell C.S. Harmar A.J. Waschek J. Herzog E.D. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide mediates circadian rhythmicity and synchrony in mammalian clock neurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Since we also identified a single vip+ grp+ night-active neuron (Figure 2B), we performed AAV.Flex.TetLC injections on Grp-CRE mice (Sun et al., 2017Sun S. Xu Q. Guo C. Guan Y. Liu Q. Dong X. Leaky Gate Model: Intensity-Dependent Coding of Pain and Itch in the Spinal Cord.Neuron. 2017; 93: 840-853.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar): silencing of GRP+SCN neurons alone was insufficient to disrupt siesta behavior (Figure S4D). Interestingly, blocking synaptic transmission from the entire SCN (Syt>TetLC) results in ∼50% of mice becoming arrhythmic, even under LD cycles ∼10–15 days post-injection (representative mouse is shown in Figure S4F; average activity is shown in Figure S4G). This is in contrast to a previous report where ablation of the SCN did not prevent mice entraining to LD cycles (Schwartz and Zimmerman, 1991Schwartz W.J. Zimmerman P. Lesions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus disrupt circadian locomotor rhythms in the mouse.Physiol. Behav. 1991; 49: 1283-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but it is consistent with another report where SCN ablation blocked daily rhythms of sleep under LD cycles (Easton et al., 2004Easton A. Meerlo P. Bergmann B. Turek F.W. The suprachiasmatic nucleus regulates sleep timing and amount in mice.Sleep. 2004; 27: 1307-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) as well as one in which TTX silencing of SCN neurons provoked acute activity (Houben et al., 2014Houben T. Coomans C.P. Meijer J.H. Regulation of circadian and acute activity levels by the murine suprachiasmatic nuclei.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e110172Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To confirm that VIP+SCN neurons regulate nighttime behavior, we next tested the effect of activating VIP neurons on RW activity. We injected the SCN of Vip-CRE mice with an AAV virus encoding a CRE-dependent version of the optogenetic tool ChETA (Gunaydin et al., 2010Gunaydin L.A. Yizhar O. Berndt A. Sohal V.S. Deisseroth K. Hegemann P. Ultrafast optogenetic control.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) (VIP>ChETA), which causes a neuron to fire upon stimulation with blue light (473 nm). We first asked what happened when we activated VIP neurons at ZT14, when most SCN neurons are normally inactive and mice display the first peak in RW activity. Stimulation of VIP+SCN neurons was achieved through illumination with 10 ms pulses of light at 473 nm at a frequency of 10 Hz for 1 h; optogenetic activation was verified by optogenetically stimulating SCN slices in vitro (Figure S5C). Similar stimulation conditions were previously reported to be sufficient to entrain the clock in constant darkness, using a slightly different version of the optogenetic channel rhodopsin (Jones et al., 2015Jones J.R. Tackenberg M.C. McMahon D.G. Manipulating circadian clock neuron firing rate resets molecular circadian rhythms and behavior.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Optogenetic activation of VIP+SCN neurons for 1 h at 10 Hz at ZT14 caused a rapid and significant reduction in RW activity compared to baseline for the duration of stimulation (Figure 3D, blue arrow and bar), followed by a significant increase in RW activity ∼4 h post-stimulation compared to baseline (green arrow in Figure 3D: see also Figure 7). By contrast, stimulation at a lower frequency of 5 Hz resulted in a non-significant decrease in activity (Figure S5A): we suggest that activating VIP+SCN neurons at 10 Hz (but not 5 Hz) mimics the high-frequency VIP neuron activation that rapidly entrains circadian locomotor rhythms (Mazuski et al., 2018Mazuski C. Abel J.H. Chen S.P. Hermanstyne T.O. Jones J.R. Simon T. Doyle 3rd, F.J. Herzog E.D.

No inhibition of activity was observed in control mice stimulated at 10 Hz (Figure 3E). An analogous, significant cessation of activity was observed for the duration of stimulation"
https://openalex.org/W3086463303,"Interpersonal trust is an important source of social and economic development. Over decades, researchers debated the question whether and how public institutions influence interpersonal trust, making this relationship a much-discussed issue for scientific debate. However, experimental and behavioral data and insights on this relationship and the underlying psychological processes are rare and often inconsistent. The present set of studies tests a model which proposes that institutional trust indirectly affects trust among unrelated strangers by enhancing individuals’ feelings of security. Study 1 (survey on trust in a broad spectrum of state institutions), Study 2 (nationally representative data from 16 countries), and Study 3 (experimental manipulation of institutional trust) provide convergent support for this hypothesis. Also, the results show that the effect remains consistent even after controlling for individual dispositions linked to interpersonal and institutional trust (Study 1 and 3) and country level indicators of institutional performance (Study 2). Taken together, these findings inform and contribute to the debate about the relationship between institutions and interpersonal trust by showing that when institutions are trusted, they increase feelings of security, and therefore promote interpersonal trust among strangers."

Infections with a novel member of the Coronaviridae family, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS–CoV-2), are a serious global health problem and are responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Many details of the infection with SARS–CoV-2 remain to be defined, but it is now clear that a substantial number of patients develop severe symptoms and pneumonia upon infection, eventually requiring intensive care and ventilator treatment with a high mortality rate (1Zhou P.

We also showed an antiviral function of endogenous sphingosine, which traps viruses in endosomes and thereby shuttles them to lysosomal degradation (25Lang J. Bohn P. Bhat H. Jastrow H. Walkenfort B.

However, it is presently unknown whether exogenous sphingosine could be also exploited as an antiviral compound. The studies reported here examined whether exogenously applied sphingosine prevents pp-SARS–CoV-2 spike infection of epithelial cells. We found that treatment of Vero epithelial or freshly isolated human nasal epithelial cells with sphingosine prevents infection with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Sphingosine binds to ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS–CoV-2, and blocks the interaction of the viral spike protein with ACE2. Sphingosine had no adverse effects on the epithelial cells. A panel of other lipids was without effect on infection of cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike and the interaction of ACE2 with the viral spike protein. Thus, sphingosine might be a novel drug for preventing and treating infections with SARS–CoV-2 in the respiratory tract. To investigate whether exogenous sphingosine prevents the infection of epithelial cells with SARS–CoV-2, we treated Vero epithelial cells with 0.25–5 μm sphingosine for 30 min and then infected the cells with pp-VSV–SARS–CoV-2 spike. The results show that sphingosine dose-dependently prevented the infection with pp-VSV–SARS–CoV-2 spike (Fig. 1A). Already concentrations of 1 μm sphingosine reduced the infection of Vero epithelial cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike by more than 90% (Fig. 1A). As specificity controls, we tested several other lipids, i.e. phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, C16-ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate, lactosyl-ceramide, cardiolipin, and octylglucopyranoside. None of them inhibited the infection of Vero cells with pp-VSV–SARS–CoV-2 spike (Fig. 1B). Sphingosine at concentrations of 0.25–5 μm was without adverse effects on cultured Vero epithelial cells (Fig. 1, C and D). Next, we tested whether exogenous sphingosine also prevented infection of freshly isolated human nasal epithelial cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. The studies revealed that 1 or 2 μm sphingosine also prevented infection of freshly isolated human nasal epithelial cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Sphingosine had no toxic effects on nasal epithelial cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Sphingosine is a small lipid that is positively charged at neutral or slightly acidic pH. The pH on nasal, tracheal, or bronchial epithelial cell surfaces is slightly acidic (26Muraglia K.A. Chorghade R.S. Kim B.R. Tang X.X. Shah V.S. Grillo A.S. Daniels P.N. Cioffi A.G. Karp P.H. Zhu L. Welsh M.J. Burke M.D. Small-molecule ion channels increase host defences in cystic fibrosis airway epithelia.Nature. 2019; 567 (30867598): 405-40810.1038/s41586-019-1018-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and thus, sphingosine will be positively charged when acting on these surfaces. The binding domain of the spike protein contains many positively charged amino acids that bind to negatively charged amino acids in the binding pocket of the ACE2 receptor, but also hydrophobic interactions between the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein and ACE2 are required for viral binding (5Lan J. Ge J. Yu J. Shan S. Zhou H. Fan S. Zhang Q. Shi X. Wang Q. Zhang L. Wang X. Structure of the SARS–CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound to the ACE2 receptor.Nature. 2020; 581 (32225176): 215-22010.1038/s41586-020-2180-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculated that sphingosine, which is an amphiphilic molecule that is positively charged, may bind to ACE2 and prevent the interaction of the spike protein with ACE2, thereby blocking infection. We tested this hypothesis by incubation of sphingosine immobilized to agarose with recombinant ACE2 protein or lysates from Vero cells and determined by Western blotting whether ACE2 directly binds to sphingosine. The results confirmed the hypothesis and showed binding of cellular or recombinant ACE2 to sphingosine beads (Fig. 3A), whereas we did not detect a binding of the recombinant receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike to sphingosine beads (not shown). The addition of soluble sphingosine prevented binding of ACE2 to immobilized sphingosine, supporting the notion of a specific interaction between ACE2 and sphingosine (Fig. 3A). Likewise, incubation of immobilized recombinant ACE2 protein with sphingosine revealed a binding of sphingosine to ACE2 (Fig. 3B). We also tested the binding of ACE2 to agarose beads coupled to sphingosine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate, or cardiolipin. Control beads were not coupled to any lipid. The results show that only sphingosine-coupled beads bound recombinant ACE2 (Fig. 3C). Next, we tested whether sphingosine interferes with the binding of viral spike protein with ACE2. To this end, immobilized recombinant Fc-ACE2 was incubated with 2 μm sphingosine or left untreated and washed, and then the recombinant receptor-binding domain of spike S1 was added. Preincubation of ACE2 with sphingosine reduced binding of the recombinant RBD of spike S1 to ACE2 (Fig. 3D). Controls show that several other lipids such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, sphingomyelin, C16-ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and cardiolipin did not affect binding of recombinant receptor-binding domain of spike S1 to immobilized recombinant ACE2 (Fig. 3E). We then immobilized a recombinant protein of the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein (His-tagged) on Ni2+–agarose and added recombinant Fc-ACE2 in the presence or absence of 2 μm sphingosine. The results show that sphingosine abolished the interaction of the receptor-binding domain of spike protein with ACE2 (Fig. 3F). A panel of other lipids, i.e. phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, C16-ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate, lactosylceramide, cardiolipin, or octylglucopyranoside did not affect the interaction of immobilized recombinant spike protein with ACE2 (Fig. 3G). Next, we tested whether sphingosine also interferes with the binding of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike to recombinant ACE2. The studies revealed that 1 or 2 μm sphingosine abrogated binding of intact pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike to immobilized recombinant ACE2, resulting in effective pseudoinfection of Vero cells with the remaining pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike particles (Fig. 4A). Finally, we performed adhesion studies of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike on Vero cells in the presence or absence of sphingosine: We infected Vero cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike for 20 min in the presence or absence of sphingosine, phosphatidylcholine sphingomyelin, C16-ceramide, sphingosine 1-phosphate, lactosyl-ceramide, or cardiolipin; stained with anti-spike S1 antibodies; and determined binding of the virus to the cells by flow cytometry. The results (Fig. 4B) show that sphingosine prevented binding of pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike to the cell surface, whereas none of the other lipids had an effect on the interaction of the virus with the cells. Our results demonstrate that exogenous sphingosine prevents infection of cultured epithelial cells and, most importantly, also freshly isolated human nasal epithelial cells with pp-VSV-SARS-CoV-2 spike. Sphingosine inhibited infection of epithelial cells already at concentrations as low as 0.25 μm, and an almost complete inhibition of infection was achieved with 2 μm sphingosine. Sphingosine had no side or toxic effects on human nasal epithelial cells or cultured Vero cells at these concentrations. In a series of biochemical and cellular studies, we demonstrate that the binding of recombinant ACE2 to viral spike protein and the adhesion of virus to cells is abrogated by coincubation with sphingosine already at low concentrations. Sphingosine specifically interacted with ACE2, whereas we did not detect binding of sphingosine to the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein. At present it is unknown how sphingosine prevents binding of spike to ACE2. It might be possible that the amphiphilic sphingosine molecule binds to polar and hydrophobic amino acids in the pocket of ACE2 that interact with the receptor-binding domain of the viral spike protein (5Lan J. Ge J. Yu J. Shan S. Zhou H. Fan S. Zhang Q. Shi X. Wang Q. Zhang L. Wang X. Structure of the SARS–CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound to the ACE2 receptor.Nature. 2020; 581 (32225176): 215-22010.1038/s41586-020-2180-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar), but further, detailed structural studies are required to clarify the details of the interaction of sphingosine with ACE2. Although our data based on cellular systems and recombinant proteins strongly suggest that sphingosine directly acts on ACE2 to prevent binding of spike, our data do not prove that sphingosine directly interacts with the ACE2 domain that interacts with the receptor-binding domain of spike. It is also possible that sphingosine interacts with other domains of ACE2 outside of the interaction site between ACE2 and the spike protein. The interaction of sphingosine with ACE2 might result in a conformational change of the spike-binding domain within ACE2, thereby preventing binding of viral spike protein. Sphingosine has been previously shown to kill bacterial pathogens at concentrations between 0.5 and 10 μm (15Grassmé H. Henry B. Ziobro R. Becker K.A. Riethmüller J. Gardner A. Seitz A.P.

Mechanistically, it was demonstrated that the positively charged sphingosine interacts with negatively charged large lipids such as cardiolipin in bacterial membranes, clusters these lipids to large and rigid membranes, and thereby induces a leakiness of the bacterial membrane (27Verhaegh R.

Here, using recombinant proteins, we demonstrate that sphingosine directly interacts with cellular receptors such as ACE2 and thereby prevents interaction of the viral spike protein with its receptor excluding an indirect effect of sphingosine on ACE2 via membrane lipids. However, in vivo it might be possible that sphingosine also interacts with other lipids in the cell membrane, which may influence the distribution and conformation of ACE2, and this effect might contribute to the sphingosine-mediated inhibition of spike binding to ACE2. We have previously shown that endogenous sphingosine also has an antiviral function (25Lang J. Bohn P. Bhat H. Jastrow H. Walkenfort B. Cansiz F. Fink J. Bauer M. Olszewski D. Ramos-Nascimento A.

These studies revealed that sphingosine binds to herpes simplex virus and thereby traps the virus within endosomes, allowing the cell to degrade the virus particle within lysosomes upon fusion of endo- and lysosomes. Whether endogenous sphingosine plays a role in the cellular defense against SARS–CoV-2 remains to be determined, but it is possible that exogenous sphingosine also binds to complete SARS–CoV-2 and thereby targets the virus to lysosomal degradation, in addition to blocking the interaction of the virus with its receptor. Thus, sphingosine may have a dual function in the defense against SARS–CoV-2 acting on ACE2 and possibly also SARS–CoV-2. Previous studies applying sphingosine to the airways of mice and minipigs via inhalation of aerosolized sphingosine demonstrated that even high concentrations of sphingosine do not induce any cell death or any other toxicity in airway epithelial cells (21Pewzner-Jung Y.

However, the functions and mechanisms of action of most identified miRNAs in porcine Sertoli cells remain largely unknown. Herein, we primarily explored the regulatory roles of miR-130a in immature porcine Sertoli cells using EdU-based high-content screening assay. The results demonstrated that 27 miRNAs have potential roles in the promotion of immature porcine Sertoli cell proliferation, and miR-130a was identified as a promising candidate. miR-130a promoted cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, whereas it impeded cell apoptosis in immature porcine Sertoli cells. It also contributed to Sertoli cell proliferation and testis development in vivo. A TMT-based proteomics approach revealed that miR-130a regulated the expression of 91 proteins and multiple pathways, including the TGF-β and PI3K/AKT signaling. miR-130a did not directly target the 3′-UTR of SMAD5; however, it increased SMAD5 phosphorylation. Moreover, miR-130a enhanced TGF-β signaling by activating SMAD5 protein, and TGF-β signaling further activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to promote cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis in porcine immature Sertoli cells. Collectively, miR-130a promoted immature porcine Sertoli cell growth by activating SMAD5 through the TGF-β-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This study, therefore, provides novel insights into the effects of miR-130a on porcine spermatogenesis through the regulation of immature Sertoli cell proliferation and apoptosis."

Methods reported to date have low reproducibility and validation studies are limited. In this study, a bioprinting based production process for generating microbeads containing a COC (COC-microbeads) was optimized and its validity tested in a large animal model (sheep). Alginate microbeads were produced and characterized for size, shape and stability under culture conditions. COC encapsulation had high efficiency and reproducibility and cumulus integrity was preserved. COC-microbeads underwent IVM, with COCs cultured in standard 2D IVM as controls. After IVM, oocytes were analyzed for nuclear chromatin configuration, bioenergetic/oxidative status and transcriptional activity of genes biomarker of mitochondrial activity (TFAM, ATP6, ATP8) and oocyte developmental competence (KHDC3, NLRP5, OOEP and TLE6). The 3D system supported oocyte nuclear maturation more efficiently than the 2D control (P<0.05). Ooplasmic mitochondrial activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation ability were increased (P<0.05). Up-regulation of TFAM, ATP6 and ATP8 and down-regulation of KHDC3, NLRP5 expression were observed in 3D IVM. In conclusion, the new bioprinting method for producing COC-microbeads has high reproducibility and efficiency. Moreover, 3D IVM improves oocyte nuclear maturation and relevant parameters of oocyte cytoplasmic maturation and could be used for clinical and toxicological applications."
https://openalex.org/W3086680524,"Heavy metals released into the environment have a significant effect on respiratory health. Lung macrophages are important in mounting an inflammatory response to injury, but they are also involved in repair of injury. Macrophages develop mixed phenotypes in complex pathological conditions and polarize to a predominant phenotype depending on the duration and stage of injury and/or repair. Little is known about the reprogramming required for lung macrophages to switch between these divergent functions; therefore, understanding the mechanism(s) by which macrophages promote metabolic reprogramming to regulate lung injury is essential. Here, we show that lung macrophages polarize to a pro-inflammatory, classically activated phenotype after cadmium-mediated lung injury. Because metabolic adaptation provides energy for the diverse macrophage functions, these classically activated macrophages show metabolic reprogramming to glycolysis. RNA-Seq revealed up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes and transcription factors regulating glycolytic flux in lung macrophages from cadmium-exposed mice. Moreover, cadmium exposure promoted increased macrophage glycolytic function with enhanced extracellular acidification rate, glycolytic metabolites, and lactate excretion. These observations suggest that cadmium mediates the persistence of classically activated lung macrophages to exacerbate lung injury.

We have shown that cadmium inhibits lung macrophage host defense by inhibiting the Rho GTPase, Rac2 (6Larson-Casey J.L. Gu L. Jackson P.L. Briles D.E. Hale J.Y. Blalock J.E. Wells J.M. Deshane J.S.

We found that cadmium promotes macrophage polarization to the pro-inflammatory, classically activated phenotype. TNFα and iNOS mRNA expression were increased 3-8–fold, respectively, in macrophages exposed to CdCl2 (Fig. 1, A and B). The alternatively activated markers, arginase 1, TGF-β1, IL-10, and PDGF-B were significantly reduced compared with vehicle exposed (Fig. 1, C–F). To determine whether cadmium mediated the persistence of a pro-inflammatory phenotype, macrophages were exposed to cadmium for 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, or 48 h. Cadmium-exposed macrophages showed a time-dependent increase in TNFα and iNOS mRNA expression with maximal expression seen 24-48 h after exposure (Fig. 1, G and H). Arginase 1 and TGF-β1 expression were drastically reduced in macrophages exposed to cadmium for 3 h (Fig. 1, I and J), whereas IL-10 and PDGF-B were significantly reduced 1 h after cadmium exposure (Fig. 1, K and L). The reduction in anti-inflammatory gene expression from cadmium-exposed macrophages persisted over the duration of the time course. Further examining the role of cadmium gene regulation, TNFα promoter activity showed nearly 4-fold increase in cadmium-exposed macrophages and was similar to LPS-exposed macrophages, which was used as a positive control (Fig. 1M). iNOS promoter activity increased nearly 10-fold in cadmium-exposed macrophages (Fig. 1N). In contrast, arginase 1 and TGF-β1 promoter activities were significantly reduced in cadmium-exposed macrophages (Fig. 1, O and P). Cadmium exposure did not alter macrophage apoptosis as no changes were detected in the mitochondrial or cytoplasmic localization of Bcl-2, cytochrome c, or Bax expression (Fig. S1, A and B). Moreover, caspase-3 activity remained unchanged over the duration in cadmium-exposed macrophages (Fig. S1C). These data suggest that cadmium induces a rapid and persistent polarization of macrophages to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. To determine the biological relevance of our in vitro observations, we exposed WT mice to cadmium at the mean concentration found in bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from cigarette smoke-exposed mice (6Larson-Casey J.L. Gu L. Jackson P.L. Briles D.E. Hale J.Y. Blalock J.E. Wells J.M. Deshane J.S. Wang Y. Davis D. Antony V.B. Massicano A.V.F. Lapi S.E. Carter A.B.

Cadmium-exposed mice showed over 2.5-fold increase in the number of BAL cells (Fig. 2A) and greater than 95% of the cells were macrophages (Fig. 2B). Cadmium exposure induced the polarization of lung macrophages to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Lung macrophages isolated from cadmium-exposed WT mice showed over 5-fold increase in TNFα and iNOS mRNA expression compared with vehicle-exposed (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, arginase 1, TGF-β1, IL-10, and PDGF-B mRNA expression were significantly reduced in lung macrophages from cadmium-exposed mice (Fig. 2, E–H). Cadmium exposure did not alter the expression or localization of Bcl-2, cytochrome c, or Bax in lung macrophages (Fig. S2, A and B) and caspase-3 activity remained unchanged between vehicle and cadmium-exposed mice (Fig. S2C). Because macrophages are phagocytic cells and to confirm that there is uptake and accumulation of cadmium in lung macrophages, transmission EM (TEM) analysis of isolated lung macrophages from cadmium-exposed mice revealed an accumulation of dark aggregates (∼1 nm in diameter, blue arrows, for reference ribosomes are indicated with orange arrowheads) found in the cytoplasm of macrophages, whereas this was absent in vehicle-exposed (Fig. 2I). Lung histology from cadmium-exposed mice revealed increased lobar consolidation associated with hemorrhage, whereas vehicle-exposed mice showed normal lung architecture (Fig. 2, J and K). These results were confirmed by increased albumin concentration in the BAL fluid indicating the presence of lung injury in cadmium-exposed mice (Fig. 2L). Moreover, the ratio of wet to dry lung weight was significantly increased in the cadmium-exposed mice (Fig. 2M). These results suggest a correlation between the cadmium-mediated lung macrophage phenotype and lung injury. The redox-sensitive transcription factor, nuclear factor (NF)-κB, is a critical mediator of the macrophage inflammatory response and is required for pro-inflammatory gene expression (18Carter A.B.

Using a promoter construct driven by NF-κB, we found that cadmium-exposed macrophages had significantly greater NF-κB–driven luciferase activity than vehicle exposed and the cadmium-induced increase in activity was significantly greater than LPS-exposed (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the transcription factors associated with classical activation, p-STAT1, and the p65 subunit of NF-κB, were localized to the nuclear fraction in macrophages exposed to cadmium, whereas p65 remained in the cytosol in vehicle-exposed (Fig. 3, B and C). Mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) are suggested to act as signal-transducing molecules that trigger inflammation by driving pro-inflammatory cytokine production (22Naik E. Dixit V.M. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species drive proinflammatory cytokine production.J. Exp.

We determined that cadmium-exposed macrophages showed a significant increase in mtROS generation (Fig. 3, D and E). These results were validated in vivo. The increased mtROS production in lung macrophages from cadmium-exposed mice (Fig. 3F) correlated with the activation of redox-regulated transcription factors. Lung macrophages from cadmium-exposed mice showed increased nuclear localization of the p65 subunit of NF-κB and p-STAT1 (Fig. 3G), whereas the p65 subunit of NF-κB remained in the cytosol in macrophages from vehicle-exposed mice (Fig. 3H). Validating that cadmium-mediated regulation of transcription factor expression was induced by mtROS generation, cadmium-exposed macrophages were treated with mitoTEMPO, a specific scavenger of mtROS. MitoTEMPO treatment significantly reduced cadmium-mediated mtROS generation to the level seen in vehicle control (Fig. 3I). Nuclear localization of the p65 subunit of NF-κB and p-STAT1 were reduced with mitoTEMPO treatment, whereas the p65 subunit of NF-κB was increased in the cytosolic fraction with mitoTEMPO treatment in macrophages exposed to vehicle or cadmium. (Fig. 3, J and K). Abrogating cadmium-mediated mtROS generation in macrophages influenced macrophage phenotypic switching. Treatment with mitoTEMPO reduced TNFα and iNOS gene expression to the level seen with vehicle alone (Fig. 3, L and M). In contrast, mitoTEMPO treatment rescued anti-inflammatory gene expression in cadmium-exposed macrophages similar to vehicle-exposed levels (Fig. 3, N–Q). These data suggest that cadmium-induced mtROS regulates redox-regulated transcription factors. Because hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) is a critical regulator of macrophage inflammation (24Cramer T. Yamanishi Y. Clausen B.E. Förster I. Pawlinski R. Mackman N. Haase V.H. Jaenisch R. Corr M. Nizet V. Firestein G.S. Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. Johnson R.S. HIF-1α is essential for myeloid cell-mediated inflammation.Cell. 2003; 112 (12628185): 645-65710.1016/S0092-8674(03)00154-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar), we determined that cadmium-exposed macrophages had increased HIF-1α expression in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4A). Inhibiting cadmium-mediated mtROS generation with mitoTEMPO treatment abolished HIF-1α expression. Studies suggest classically activated macrophages utilize glycolytic metabolism, which can be rapidly activated to fuel responses for injury (25Duffield J.S. Forbes S.J. Constandinou C.M. Clay S.

Additionally, HIF-1α influences the metabolic reprogramming of macrophages to glycolysis (28Tannahill G.M. Curtis A.M. Adamik J. Palsson-McDermott E.M. McGettrick A.F. Goel G. Frezza C. Bernard N.J.

A critical activator of glucose metabolism, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), was similarly increased in macrophages exposed to cadmium and the expression of PFKFB3 was redox-regulated (Fig. 4B). To measure glycolytic flux, lactate excretion was measured in conditioned media from cadmium-exposed macrophages. Lactate was significantly increased in cell culture media from cadmium-exposed macrophages, whereas mitoTEMPO reduced lactate to control levels (Fig. 4C). Measuring glycolytic function via extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), cadmium-exposed macrophages showed increased ECAR compared with vehicle-exposed macrophages (Fig. 4D). Studies indicate PPARγ plays a critical role in mediating the alternative activation of macrophages (15Odegaard J.I. Ricardo-Gonzalez R.R. Goforth M.H. Morel C.R. Subramanian V. Mukundan L.

We determined that PPARγ expression was absent in CdCl2-exposed macrophages (Fig. 4E). Treating macrophages with mitoTEMPO induced alternative activation with STAT6 activation and PPARγ nuclear expression in cadmium-exposed macrophages. These data suggest that inhibiting mtROS generation in cadmium-exposed macrophages induces the phenotypic switching of macrophages and reduced glycolytic metabolism, a key feature of alternatively activated macrophages. To further understand the bioenergetics in cadmium-exposed macrophages, RNA-Seq was performed in lung macrophages isolated from vehicle- and cadmium-exposed mice. Key glycolytic enzymes, hexokinase 2 (Hk2), phosphofructokinase (Pfkm), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), pyruvate kinase (PKM), and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) were greater in cadmium-exposed lung macrophages (Fig. 4F). The transcription factors, c-myc and Hif1α, considered master regulators of glycolytic flux, were increased in lung macrophages from cadmium-exposed mice. Because cellular metabolism plays an important role during macrophage polarization, we validated that HIF-1α was increased in lung macrophages from cadmium-exposed mice (Fig. 4G). Cadmium promoted a shift from mitochondrial oxidation toward glycolytic metabolism. Confirming the RNA-Seq data, lung macrophages isolated from cadmium-exposed mice showed increased PFKFB3 expression (Fig. 4H). Furthermore, BAL fluid from cadmium-exposed mice had elevated lactate levels, a measure of glycolytic flux (Fig. 4I). The increased flux was confirmed by an increase in ECAR in the cadmium-exposed mice (Fig. 4J). These data suggest that cadmium regulates the metabolic reprogramming to glycolysis, a critical bioenergetic characteristic in classically activated macrophages. Because cadmium treatment drastically reduced PPARγ expression and to understand the role of cadmium in promoting glycolysis, glycolytic intermediates and amino acid levels were measured by MS in macrophages expressing PPARγ and exposed to cadmium (Fig. 5A). Expression of PPARγ or treatment of cadmium did not alter glucose, glucose 6-phosphate, ribose 5-phosphate, or fructose 1,6-bisphosphate levels (Fig. 5, B–D). Although macrophages exposed to cadmium showed no change in glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, PPARγ-expressing macrophages showed increased levels (Fig. 5E). Suggesting an increase in glycolysis, cadmium-exposed macrophages had a significant increase in 3-phosphoglycerate (Fig. 5F). Whereas serine levels remained unchanged, cysteine and glycine synthesis were reduced in cadmium-exposed and PPARγ-expressing macrophages. Further implicating enhanced glycolysis, phosphoenolpyruvate, and alanine levels were increased in cadmium-exposed macrophages and PPARγ expression reduced levels to that seen in controls (Fig. 5G). These studies suggest that cadmium promotes glycolysis in lung macrophages and PPARγ may provide a therapeutic mechanism to abrogate cadmium-mediated lung injury. Because PPARγ is a critical regulator of the anti-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages, we questioned if overexpression of PPARγ could alter the cadmium-mediated phenotypic switching of macrophages. Macrophages expressing PPARγ showed significantly reduced mtROS generation after cadmium exposure (Fig. 6A). The down-regulation of cadmium-mediated mtROS completely abrogated gene expression of TNFα and iNOS mRNA in cadmium-exposed macrophages expressing PPARγ (Fig. 6, B and C). The reverse was seen with the anti-inflammatory markers. PPARγ-expressing macrophages had significantly greater arginase 1, TGF-β1, IL-10, and PDGF-B mRNA expression (Fig. 6, D–G). More importantly, cadmium exposure did not alter expression of these genes in PPARγ-expressing macrophages. Because PPARγ regulated macrop"

Research has shown, however, that intentional weight loss results are often short-lived, with people regaining the weight over time. This can lead to weight cycling–losing and gaining weight repeatedly. Previous research, mostly done over two decades ago, concluded there was no relationship between weight cycling and psychological health. The goal of the current paper was to re-examine the relationship between weight cycling and depressive symptoms in a national sample of American adults (N = 2702; 50.7% female; mean age = 44.8 years). If, as hypothesized, there is a relationship between more frequent weight cycling and depressive symptoms, then internalized weight stigma will be examined as a potential mediator of the relationship. Results of a cross-sectional survey showed that 74.6% of adults report they have intentionally tried to lose weight. Amongst those who have tried to lose to weight, the average number of weight cycles over the lifetime was 7.82 cycles. Simultaneous regression showed that greater weight cycling was related to greater reported depressive symptoms (β = .15, p < .001), controlling for age, gender, education, income, and body mass index. Internalized weight stigma was a partial mediator of this relationship. Discussion focuses on the potential implications for weight cycling and mental health."

In this note we argue that individuals' adherence to prescriptions and reduction of social activity may not be efficacious if not implemented robustly on all social groups, especially on those characterized by intense mixing patterns. Actually, it is possible that, if those who have many contacts reduce them proportionally less than those who have few, then the effect of a policy could backfire: the disease would take more time to die out, up to the point that it could become endemic. In a nutshell, unless one gets everyone to act, and specifically those who have more contacts, a policy may even be counterproductive."
https://openalex.org/W3085130314,"Oxidative stress (OS) plays a marked role in aging and results from a variety of stressors, making it a powerful measure of health and a way to examine costs associated with life history investments within and across species. However, few urinary OS markers have been examined under field conditions, particularly in primates, and their utility to non-invasively monitor the costs of acute stressors versus the long-term damage associated with aging is poorly understood. In this study, we examined variation in 5 urinary markers of oxidative damage and protection under 5 validation paradigms for 37 wild, chimpanzees living in the Kibale National Park, Uganda. We used 924 urine samples to examine responses to acute immune challenge (respiratory illness or severe wounding), as well as mixed-longitudinal and intra-individual variation with age. DNA damage (8-OHdG) correlated positively with all other markers of damage (F-isoprostanes, MDA-TBARS, and neopterin) but did not correlate with protection (total antioxidant capacity). Within individuals, all markers of damage responded to at least one if not both types of acute infection. While OS is expected to increase with age, this was not generally true in chimpanzees. However, significant changes in oxidative damage were detected within past-prime individuals and those close to death. Our results indicate that OS can be measured using field-collected urine and integrates short- and long-term aspects of health. They further suggest that more data are needed from long-lived, wild animals to illuminate if common age-related increases in inflammation and OS damage are typical or recently aberrant in humans."
https://openalex.org/W3086152977,"Mitochondrial adaptation during non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) include remodeling of flux and sustained tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity, which are concurrent to onset of oxidative stress. Over 70% of obese humans have NAFLD and diets are common weight loss strategies. However, the effectiveness of diets toward alleviating NAFLD remains unclear. We hypothesized that chronic ketogenesis will worsen metabolic dysfunction and oxidative stress during NAFLD. Mice (C57BL/6) were kept (for 16-wks) on either a low-fat, high-fat, or high-fat diet supplemented with 1.5X branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) by replacing carbohydrate calories (ketogenic). The diet induced hepatic lipid oxidation and ketogenesis, and produced multifaceted changes in flux through the individual steps of the TCA cycle. Higher rates of hepatic oxidative fluxes fueled by the diet paralleled lower rates of de novo lipogenesis. Interestingly, this metabolic remodeling did not improve insulin resistance, but induced fibrogenic genes and inflammation in the liver. Under a chronic ketogenic environment, the hepatocyte diverted more acetyl-CoA away from lipogenesis toward ketogenesis and TCA cycle, a milieu which can hasten oxidative stress and inflammation. In summary, chronic exposure to environment during obesity and NAFLD has the potential to aggravate hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3085593379,"Notwithstanding intensified therapy, a considerable fraction of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients face a dismal prognosis due to primary resistance to treatment and relapse, raising the need for more efficient and targeted therapies. Hedgehog (HH) signaling is a major developmental pathway frequently deregulated in cancer, for which a role in T-ALL is emerging. Mounting evidence suggests that ligand-independent activation of HH pathway occurs in cancer including T-ALL, emphasizing the necessity of dissecting the complex interplay between HH and other signaling pathways regulating activation. In this work, we present a therapeutically relevant crosstalk between HH signaling and the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) pathway acting at the level of GLI1 transcription factor. GLI inhibitor GANT61 and dexamethasone were shown to exert a synergistic anti-leukemic effect in vitro in T-ALL cell lines and patient-derived xenografts. Mechanistically, dexamethasone-activated NR3C1 impaired GLI1 function by dynamically modulating the recruitment of PCAF acetyltransferase and HDAC1 deacetylase. Increased GLI1 acetylation was associated with compromised transcriptional activity and reduced protein stability. In summary, our study identifies a novel crosstalk between GLI1 and NR3C1 signaling pathway which could be exploited in HH-dependent malignancies to increase therapeutic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3086123497,"12-Lipoxygenase (12-LOX) is a key enzyme in arachidonic acid metabolism, and alongside its major product, 12-HETE, plays a key role in promoting inflammatory signaling during diabetes pathogenesis. Although 12-LOX is a proposed therapeutic target to protect pancreatic islets in the setting of diabetes, little is known about the consequences of blocking its enzymatic activity during embryonic development. Here, we have leveraged the strengths of the zebrafish—genetic manipulation and pharmacologic inhibition—to interrogate the role of 12-LOX in pancreatic development. Lipidomics analysis during zebrafish development demonstrated that 12-LOX-generated metabolites of arachidonic acid increase sharply during organogenesis stages, and that this increase is blocked by morpholino-directed depletion of 12-LOX. Furthermore, we found that either depletion or inhibition of 12-LOX impairs both exocrine pancreas growth and unexpectedly, the generation of insulin-producing β cells. We demonstrate that morpholino-mediated knockdown of GPR31, a purported G-protein-coupled receptor for 12-HETE, largely phenocopies both the depletion and the inhibition of 12-LOX. Moreover, we show that loss of GPR31 impairs pancreatic bud fusion and pancreatic duct morphogenesis. Together, these data provide new insight into the requirement of 12-LOX in pancreatic organogenesis and islet formation, and additionally provide evidence that its effects are mediated via a signaling axis that includes the 12-HETE receptor GPR31."

However, nebivolol, beta-blocker with nitric oxide-releasing effect, could theoretically improve coronary vasospasm. We compared nebivolol versus diltiazem in improving coronary vasospasm and quality of life in patients with hypertensive vasospastic angina during a 12-week follow-up. Methods Fifty-one hypertensive patients with documented coronary vasospasm were randomly allocated into 3 treatment groups: (1) Nebivolol Group (5mg for 2 weeks/10mg for 10 weeks); (2) Diltiazem Group (90mg for 2 weeks/180mg for 10 weeks); (3) Low-dose Combination Group (2.5mg + 45mg for 2 weeks/5mg + 90mg for 10 weeks). The primary endpoint was to compare the percent changes in coronary vasospasm at 12 weeks from baseline among the 3 groups. The secondary endpoints included changes in quality of life based on the Seattle Angina Questionnaire and changes in blood pressure at 12 weeks from baseline. Results Significant improvements in coronary vasospasm were found in all groups; however, the improvement in percent changes in coronary artery spasm was greatest in the Diltiazem Group (50.4±8.8% vs. 67.8±12.8% vs. 46.8±12.3%, Nebivolol Group vs. Diltiazem Group p = 0.008; Nebivolol Group vs. Low-dose Combination Group p = 0.999; Diltiazem Group vs. Low-dose Combination Group p = 0.017). The overall Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores were significantly elevated at 12 weeks compared to the baseline in entire study population. There were no significant differences between the three groups in the overall Seattle Angina Questionnaire score changes and blood pressure changes. Conclusions Both nebivolol and diltiazem showed significant coronary vasospasm reduction effect, but the effect was greater for diltiazem."
https://openalex.org/W3085209425,"The G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels play important signaling roles in the central and peripheral nervous systems. However, the role of GIRK channel activation in pain signaling remains unknown mainly due to the lack of potent and selective GIRK channel activators until recently. The present study was designed to determine the effects and mechanisms of ML297, a selective GIRK1/2 activator, on nociception in the spinal cord by using behavioral studies and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons. Rats were prepared for chronic lumber catheterization and intrathecal administration of ML297. The nociceptive flexion reflex was tested using an analgesy-meter, and the influence on motor performance was assessed using an accelerating rotarod. We also investigated pre- and post-synaptic actions of ML297 in spinal cord preparations by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Intrathecal administration of ML297 increased the mechanical nociceptive threshold without impairing motor function. In voltage-clamp mode of patch-clamp recordings, bath application of ML297 induced outward currents in a dose-dependent manner. The ML297-induced currents demonstrated specific equilibrium potential like other families of potassium channels. At high concentration, ML297 depressed miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) but not their amplitude. The ML297-induced outward currents and suppression of mEPSCs were not inhibited by naloxone, a μ-opioid receptor antagonist. These results demonstrated that intrathecal ML297 showed the antinociceptive effect, which was mediated through direct activation of pre- and post-synaptic GIRK channels. Selective GIRK channel activation is a promising strategy for the development of new agents against chronic pain and opioid tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3085943157,"E. granulosus is a cestode that causes Cystic Echinococcosis (CE), a zoonotic disease with worldwide presence. The immune response generated by the host against the metacestode induces a permissive Th2 response, as opposed to pro-inflammatory Th1 response. In this view, mixed Th2 and regulatory responses allow parasite survival. Overall, larval Echinococcus infections induce strong regulatory responses. Fasciola hepatica, another common helminth parasite, represents a major infection in cattle. Co-infection with different parasite species in the same host, polyparasitism, is a common occurrence involving E. granulosus and F. hepatica in cattle. 'While it is known that infection with F. hepatica also triggers a polarized Th2/Treg immune response, little is reported regarding effects on the systemic immune response of this example of polyparasitism. F. hepatica also triggers immune responses polarized to the Th2/ Treg spectrum. Serum samples from 107 animals were analyzed, and were divided according to their infection status and Echinococcal cysts fertility. Cytokines were measured utilizing a Milliplex Magnetic Bead Panel to detect IFN-γ, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IL-18. Cattle infected only with F. hepatica had the highest concentration of every cytokine analyzed, with both 4.24 and 3.34-fold increases in IL-10 and IL-4, respectively, compared to control animals, followed by E. granulosus and F. hepatica co-infected animals with two-fold increase in IL-10 and IL-4, compared to control animals, suggesting that E. granulosus co-infection dampens the cattle Th2/Treg immune response against F. hepatica. When considering Echinococcal cyst fertility and systemic cytokine concentrations, fertile cysts had higher IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-18 concentrations, while infertile cysts had higher IL-10 concentrations. These results show that E. granulosus co-infection lowers Th1 and Th2 cytokine serological concentration when compared to F. hepatica infection alone. E. granulosus infections show no difference in IFN-γ, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6 and IL-18 levels compared with control animals, highlighting the immune evasion mechanisms of this cestode."
https://openalex.org/W3086501576,"Glucocorticoids (GCs), stress-induced steroid hormones, are released by adrenal cortex and essential for stress adaptation. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the relationship between GCs and pregnancy following the discovery that glucocorticoid receptor is necessary for implantation. It has been widely recognized that stress is detrimental to pregnancy. However, effects of stress-induced GC exposure on uterine receptivity and decidualization are still poorly understood. This study aims to explore the effects of GCs exposure on uterine receptivity, decidualization, and their underlying mechanisms in mice. Single prolonged stress (SPS) and corticosterone (Cort) injection models were used to analyze effects of GC exposure on early pregnancy, respectively. SPS or Cort injection inhibits embryo implantation by interfering Lif signaling and stimulating the uterine deposition of collagen types I, III, and IV on day 4 of pregnancy. Uterine decidualization is also attenuated by SPS or Cort injection through suppressing Cox-2 expression. Cort-induced collagen disorder also suppresses decidualization through regulating mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Our data should shed lights for a better understanding for the effects of GCs on embryo implantation for clinical research."
https://openalex.org/W3086797253,"Endocannabinoid signaling plays a regulatory role in various (neuro)biological functions. 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is the most abundant endocannabinoid, and although its canonical biosynthetic pathway involving phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C and diacylglycerol lipase α is known, alternative pathways remain unsettled. Here, we characterize a noncanonical pathway implicating glycerophosphodiesterase 3 (GDE3, from GDPD2 gene). Human GDE3 expressed in HEK293T cell membranes catalyzed the conversion of lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) into monoacylglycerol and inositol-1-phosphate. The enzyme was equally active against 1-acyl and 2-acyl LPI. When using 2-acyl LPI, where arachidonic acid is the predominant fatty acid, LC-MS analysis identified 2-AG as the main product of LPI hydrolysis by GDE3. Furthermore, inositol-1-phosphate release into the medium occurred upon addition of LPI to intact cells, suggesting that GDE3 is actually an ecto-lysophospholipase C. In cells expressing G-protein–coupled receptor GPR55, GDE3 abolished 1-acyl LPI–induced signaling. In contrast, upon simultaneous ex-pression of GDE3 and cannabinoid receptor CB2, 2-acyl LPI evoked the same signal as that induced by 2-AG. These data strongly suggest that, in addition to degrading the GPR55 LPI ligand, GDE3 can act as a switch between GPR55 and CB2 signaling. Coincident with a major expression of both GDE3 and CB2 in the spleen, spleens from transgenic mice lacking GDE3 displayed doubling of LPI content compared with WT mice. Decreased production of 2-AG in whole spleen was also observed, supporting the in vivo relevance of our findings. These data thus open a new research avenue in the field of endocannabinoid generation and reinforce the view of GPR55 and LPI being genuine actors of the endocannabinoid system.

We postulated that LPI instead of GPIns could be the natural substrate of GDE3 (Fig. 1B). If so, this LPI-specific phospholipase C (LPI-PLC) would allow breakdown of the main endogenous ligand of GPR55. With LPI bearing an arachidonoyl group at the sn-2 position, GDE3 would also provide an alternative route for 2-AG production (Fig. 1B). Using recombinant human GDE3 expressed in HEK293T cells and exogenous LPI at physiological concentrations, we bring evidence that this is actually the case. During the preparation of this article, Tsutsumi et al. (29Tsutsumi T. Matsuda R. Morito K. Kawabata K. Yokota M. Nikawadori M. Inoue-Fujiwara M. Kawashima S. Hidaka M. Yamamoto T. Yamazaki N.

In the present study, we further show that coexpression of GDE3 with GPR55 abrogates interaction of LPI with GPR55, whereas at the vicinity of CB2, GDE3 allows LPI to evoke signaling events identical to those induced by 2-AG. Finally, invalidation of mouse GDE3 gene (Gdpd2) resulted in accumulation of LPI together with a reduction of 2-AG content in the spleen, i.e. the organ displaying one of the highest expression levels of GDE3. This will stimulate further studies aimed at defining the biological function of GDE3 within the endocannabinoid system. To test our working hypothesis, HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids allowing the expression of human GDE3 in fusion with GFP or with red fluorescent protein (RFP) at its C-terminal. Two other plasmids bore the R230A mutation previously shown to suppress hydrolytic activity of GDE3 against GPIns (23Corda D. Kudo T. Zizza P. Iurisci C. Kawai E. Kato N. Yanaka N. Mariggiò S.

All the fusion proteins displayed an exclusive localization in particulate fraction (Fig. 2A), as expected from the sequence of GDE3 (21Yanaka N.

Moreover, confocal microscopy revealed the presence of WT and mutated GDE3 at the plasma membrane, whereas GFP alone remained cytosolic (Fig. 2, B–D). Incubation of membranes containing WT GDE3 with [3H]Ins-LPI (1-acyl) resulted in almost total hydrolysis of the substrate with appearance of water-soluble radioactivity (Fig. 2E). However, no LPI hydrolysis could be detected with GDE3 bearing the R230A mutation. Using anion exchange HPLC, the radioactive water-soluble compound was identified as Ins1P (Fig. 2F). Exclusion of Ins (Fig. 2G) and GPIns (Fig. 2H) as water-soluble products of LPI cleavage eliminated the possibility of GDE3 being a lysophospholipase D or A, respectively. The GDE3 mechanism differed from that of bacterial PLC, which produced cyclic Ins-1,2-phosphate (Fig. 2I). This was partially converted into Ins1P upon acidic hydrolysis (Fig. 2J). When nonradioactive LPI (2-acyl) was used as a substrate, 2-AG was identified by LC-MS as the main product of hydrolysis (Fig. 2K). GDE3 equally hydrolyzed 1-acyl and 2-acyl LPI species (Fig. 2L). Among five different phospholipids, LPI was the only lysophospholipid degraded by GDE3 (Table 1).Table 1Specificity of GDE3 lysoPLC activity for LPISubstratesMonoacylglycerol formed (pmol/assay)MockGDE32-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoinositol3515471-myristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine001-myristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine001-myristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol001-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine1.43.3 Open table in a new tab GDE2 is another glycerophosphodiesterase displaying very common features with GDE3, i.e. six putative transmembrane segments and an active site oriented to the cell exterior (30Park S.

However, GDE2 did not achieve hydrolysis of either LPI or lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (Fig. 2M). LPC was tested with the view that GDE2 was also reported to degrade sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (34Gallazzini M. Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. GDPD5 is a glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase that osmotically regulates the osmoprotective organic osmolyte GPC.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Intact GDE2 activity against glycosyl-PI anchors was previously shown to require reduction of an intracellular disulfide bridge (35Yan Y. Sabharwal P. Rao M. Sockanathan S. The antioxidant enzyme Prdx1 controls neuronal differentiation by thiol-redox-dependent activation of GDE2.Cell. 2009; 138 (19766572): 1209-122110.1016/j.cell.2009.06.042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the C25S mutant of GDE2, which abrogates the inhibitory intracellular disulfide bridge of GDE2 (35Yan Y. Sabharwal P. Rao M. Sockanathan S. The antioxidant enzyme Prdx1 controls neuronal differentiation by thiol-redox-dependent activation of GDE2.Cell. 2009; 138 (19766572): 1209-122110.1016/j.cell.2009.06.042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), remained inactive toward the two substrates (Fig. 2M). Finally, the consensus sequence common to classical PLC and various GDEs (Fig. 3) indicated that a very constant glutamate residue at position 260 was selectively replaced by glutamine in GDE2. But again, the E260Q mutant of GDE2 did not reveal any hydrolytic activity toward the two lysophospholipid substrates (Fig. 2M). The same negative results were obtained with the GDE2 mutant bearing the double C25S/E260Q mutation (Fig. 2M)). In conclusion, GDE2 enzymatic activity is restricted to glycosyl-PI anchors (30Park S. Lee C. Sabharwal P. Zhang M. Meyers C.L. Sockanathan S. GDE2 promotes neurogenesis by glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchor cleavage of RECK.Science. 2013; 339 (23329048): 324-32810.1126/science.1231921Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Matas-Rico E. van Veen M.

GDE3 lysoPLC activity was maximal at pH 7.4 (9.0 ± 0.5 nmol × min−1 × mg−1, mean ± S.E., four determinations) and required [Ca2+] at mm range (Fig. 4). It increased up to 50 μm LPI and decreased afterward (Fig. 4E), indicating that it was restricted to monomers (critical micelle concentration of LPI is around 30–70 μm (36Bondarenko A.I. Malli R. Graier W.F. The GPR55 agonist lysophosphatidylinositol directly activates intermediate-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels.Pflügers Arch. 2011; 462 (21603896): 245-25510.1007/s00424-011-0977-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)), in a range of concentrations occurring in biological fluids (13Yamashita A.

Altogether, these data identify GDE3 as an LPI-specific PLC. This activity is supported by the same active site involved in GPIns hydrolysis (23Corda D. Kudo T. Zizza P. Iurisci C. Kawai E. Kato N. Yanaka N. Mariggiò S. The developmentally regulated osteoblast phosphodiesterase GDE3 is glycerophosphoinositol-specific and modulates cell growth.J. Biol.

The main difference between the two substrates is that LPI can provide monoacylglycerol instead of glycerol. Because both 1-acyl and 2-acyl LPI species are equally cleaved, GDE3 might thus participate in an alternative pathway of 2-AG production. When [3H]Ins-LPI was added to confluent HEK293T cells expressing GDE3, a water-soluble radioactive compound accumulated in supernatant (Fig. 5A). With cells expressing the R230A mutant of GDE3, production of the radioactive water-soluble compound was abolished (Fig. 5A). Together with the fact that GDE3 is essentially localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, C and D), and in agreement with structural predictions deduced from GDE3 sequence (21Yanaka N. Mammalian glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterases.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71 (17690467): 1811-181810.1271/bbb.70062Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Corda D. Mosca M.G.

Conventional Alox15−/− mice are viable, develop normally but do not exhibit a major defective erythropoietic phenotype. To characterize the putative in vivo relevance of Alox15 for red blood cell development, we explored the impact of systemic inactivation of the Alox15 gene on mouse erythropoiesis. We found that Alox15−/− mice exhibited reduced erythrocyte counts, elevated reticulocyte counts and red cell hyperchromia. The structure of the plasma membrane of Alox15−/− erythrocytes is altered and a significant share of the red cells was present as echinocytes and/or acanthocytes. An increased share of the Alox15−/− erythrocytes cells were annexin V positive, which indicates a loss of plasma membrane asymmetry. Erythrocytes of Alox15−/− mice were more susceptible to osmotic hemolysis and exhibited a reduced ex vivo life span. When we transgenically expressed human ALOX15 in Alox15−/− mice under the control of the aP2 promoter the defective erythropoietic system was rescued and the impaired osmotic resistance was normalized. Together these data suggest the involvement Alox15 in the maturational remodeling of the plasma membrane during red cell development."

Previous studies identified that sustained endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-mediated apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells and directly contributed to diabetes. In the present study, we showed that Kcnh6 knockout (KO) mice had impaired glucose tolerance mediated by high ER stress levels, and showed increased apoptosis and elevated intracellular calcium levels in pancreatic β-cells. In contrast, KCNH6 overexpression in islets isolated from C57BL/6J mice attenuated ER stress induced by thapsigargin or palmitic acid. This effect contributed to better preservation of β-cells, as reflected in increased β cell survival and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. These results were further corroborated by studies evaluating KCNH6 overexpression in KO islets. Similarly, induction of Kcnh6 in KO mice by lentivirus injection improved glucose tolerance by reducing pancreatic ER stress and apoptosis. Our data provide new insights into how Kcnh6 deficiency causes ER calcium depletion and β cell dysfunction."

We attempted to elucidate the impact of hepatobiliary cholesterol handling on the homeostasis of sphingolipids and lysophospholipids, especially sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). We induced the overexpression of NPC1L1 or ABCG5/8 in the mouse liver. Hepatic NPC1L1 overexpression increased the plasma and hepatic S1P levels, while it decreased the biliary S1P levels, and all of these changes were inhibited by ezetimibe. The ability of HDL to activate Akt in the endothelial cells was augmented by hepatic NPC1L1 overexpression. NPC1L1-mediated S1P transport was confirmed by both in vitro and in vivo studies conducted using C17S1P, an exogenous S1P analog. Upregulation of apolipoprotein M (apoM) was involved in these modulations, although apoM was not necessary for these modulations. Moreover, the increase in the plasma S1P levels also observed in ABCG5/8-overexpressing mice was dependent on the elevation of the plasma apoM levels. In regard to other sphingolipids and lysophospholipids, ceramides were similarly modulated by NPC1L1 to S1P, while other lipids were differently influenced by NPC1L1 or ABCG5/8 from S1P. Hepatobiliary cholesterol handling might also regulate the functional lipids, such as S1P."

https://openalex.org/W3086589273,"Appropriate control of hepatic gluconeogenesis is essential for the organismal survival upon prolonged fasting and maintaining systemic homeostasis under metabolic stress. Here, we show protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), a key enzyme that catalyzes the protein arginine methylation process, particularly the isoform encoded by Prmt1 variant 2 (PRMT1V2), is critical in regulating gluconeogenesis in the liver. Liver-specific deletion of Prmt1 reduced gluconeogenic capacity in cultured hepatocytes and in the liver. Prmt1v2 was expressed at a higher level compared to Prmt1v1 in hepatic tissue and cells. Gain-of-function of PRMT1V2 clearly activated the gluconeogenic program in hepatocytes via interactions with PGC1α, a key transcriptional coactivator regulating gluconeogenesis, enhancing its activity via arginine methylation, while no effects of PRMT1V1 were observed. Similar stimulatory effects of PRMT1V2 in controlling gluconeogenesis were observed in human HepG2 cells. PRMT1, specifically PRMT1V2, was stabilized in fasted liver and hepatocytes treated with glucagon, in a PGC1α-dependent manner. PRMT1, particularly Prmt1v2, was significantly induced in the liver of streptozocin-induced type 1 diabetes and high fat diet-induced type 2 diabetes mouse models and liver-specific Prmt1 deficiency drastically ameliorated diabetic hyperglycemia. These findings reveal that PRMT1 modulates gluconeogenesis and mediates glucose homeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions, suggesting that deeper understanding how PRMT1 contributes to the coordinated efforts in glycemic control may ultimately present novel therapeutic strategies that counteracts hyperglycemia in disease settings."

In their work, they suggested that the bioluminescence reaction in fungi is a two-step process involving a NAD(P)H-dependent soluble enzyme and a membrane-bound luciferase (7Airth R.L. Foerster G.E.

In the second step, the luciferase catalyzes the oxidation of the fungal luciferin, resulting in light emission. For many decades, no significant progress was made concerning the identification of the fungal luciferin and luciferase system. In 2011, Mori et al. (9Mori K. Kojima S. Maki S. Hirano T. Niwa H.

Over the last few years, details on the molecular basis of fungal bioluminescence have emerged. Purtov et al. (14Purtov K.V. Petushkov V.N. Baranov M.S. Mineev K.S. Rodionova N.S. Kaskova Z.M.

Kaskova et al. (15Kaskova Z.M. Dörr F.A. Petushkov V.N. Purtov K.V. Tsarkova A.S. Rodionova N.S. Mineev K.S. Guglya E.B. Kotlobay A. Baleeva N.S. Baranov M.S. Arseniev A.S. Gitelson J.I. Lukyanov S.

The discovery of the fungal luciferin (3-hydroxyhispidin) biosynthesis and recycling pathway was a breakthrough reported by Kotlobay et al. (16Kotlobay A.A. Sarkisyan K.S. Mokrushina Y.A. Marcet-Houben M. Serebrovskaya E.O. Markina N.M. Somermeyer L.G. Gorokhovatsky A.Y. Vvedensky A. Purtov K.V. Petushkov V.N. Rodionova N.S. Chepurnyh T.V. Fakhranurova L.I.

In their study, the entire cycle was elucidated which involves a hispidin-synthase, a hispidin 3-hydroxylase (H3H), a luciferase, and a caffeylpyruvate hydrolase. The cluster encompassing the respective genes was found to be conserved in other luminescent fungi. This suggests that all luminescent fungi share the same luciferin/luciferase system. The enzymes and chemistry involved do not show any resemblance with other hitherto known bioluminescence systems (Scheme 1). Recently, a plant was equipped with the fungal genes responsible for luminescence. Upon insertion of the four mentioned genes from the bioluminescent mushroom Neonothopanus nambi into the DNA of tobacco plants, luminous plants were created (17Mitiouchkina T. Mishin A.S. Somermeyer L.G. Markina N.M. Chepurnyh T.V. Guglya E.B. Karataeva T.A. Palkina K.A. Shakhova E.S. Fakhranurova L.I. Chekova S.V. Tsarkova A.S. Golubev Y.V. Negrebetsky V.V. Dolgushin S.A. et al.Plants with genetically encoded autoluminescence.Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38 (32341562): 944-94610.1038/s41587-020-0500-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The functioning of the fungal system in tobacco plants confirms that it can simply be fueled with the plant endogenous substrate caffeic acid. The luminescence was also found to be superior when compared with the bacterial luminescence system, demonstrating that the fungal light-emitting enzyme system has attractive features. Here, we report on the heterologous recombinant expression, purification, and biochemical characterization of hispidin 3-hydroxylase from Mycena chlorophos (McH3H) (18Berkeley M.J. Curtis M.A. Characters of new fungi, collected in the North Pacific Exploring Expedition by Charles Wright.Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 1860; 4: 111-130Google Scholar). This enzyme was found to be a monomeric NAD(P)H-dependent, FAD-containing monooxygenase, which catalyzes the hydroxylation of hispidin to form 3-hydroxyhispidin (Scheme 1). The study provides the first detailed insights into the properties of a fungal luciferin-producing enzyme and has resulted in enzyme variants with different nicotinamide cofactor specificities. The developed expression system and elucidated catalytic features provide a good basis for further studies into the molecular mechanisms of fungal bioluminescence. Although the genes responsible for luminescence in the prototype light-emitting fungus M. chlorophos have been identified, the respective enzymes have not been studied in detail. To investigate the enzymatic properties of a fungal luciferin-producing hydroxylase, we decided to express the putative hispidin hydroxylase from M. chlorophos: McH3H. A BLAST search (NCBI) with the McH3H protein sequence confirmed that this enzyme is a representative of many homologous fungal proteins that appear to be orthologs in view of the relatively high sequence identity. A search in the database of proteins for which the three-dimensional structure has been elucidated confirmed sequence relationship with well-studied class A flavoprotein monooxygenases (19van Berkel W.J.H. Kamerbeek N.M. Fraaije M.W. Flavoprotein monooxygenases, a diverse class of oxidative biocatalysts.J.

These monooxygenases are single component monooxygenases that typically contain a tightly bound FAD cofactor and depend on NADPH and/or NADH as coenzyme for activity. The highest sequence identity (29%) was found with salicylate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas putida G7 (PpSALH) (21Costa D.M.A. Gómez S.V. de Araújo S.S. Pereira M.S. Alves R.B. Favaro D.C. Hengge A.C. Nagem R.A.P. Brandão T.A.S. Catalytic mechanism for the conversion of salicylate into catechol by the flavin-dependent monooxygenase salicylate hydroxylase.Int. J. Biol.

A multiple sequence alignment of McH3H, PpSALH, 3-hydroxybenzoate 6-hydroxylase from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 (Rj3HB6H), and p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase from Pseudomonas fluorescens (PfPHBH, the prototype class A flavoprotein monooxygenase) revealed conservation of several canonical sequence motifs (GXGXXG, GD and DG motifs) (Fig. S1). At the N terminus, a GXGXXG sequence motif is conserved which forms part of the Rossmann fold domain that binds the ADP moiety of the FAD cofactor (Fig. S1) (22Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. Prediction of the occurrence of the ADP-binding βαβ-fold in proteins, using an amino acid sequence fingerprint.J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187 (3959077): 101-10710.1016/0022-2836(86)90409-2Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The sequence of McH3H also contains other conserved regions that confirm a similar binding mode of the FAD cofactor (23Eppink M.H.M. Schreuder H.A. van Berkel W.J.H. Identification of a novel conserved sequence motif in flavoprotein hydroxylases with a putative dual function in FAD/NAD(P)H binding.Protein Sci. 1997; 6 (9385648): 2454-245810.1002/pro.5560061119Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the sequence differs significantly from PfPHBH in the region encompassing residues 40–50. The corresponding part in the structure of PfPHBH has been shown to tune the coenzyme specificity toward NADPH (24Eppink M.H.M. Overkamp K.M. Schreuder H.A. van Berkel W.J.H. Switch of coenzyme specificity of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292 (10493859): 87-9610.1006/jmbi.1999.3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and may suggest that McH3H has a different coenzyme specificity (25Westphal A.H. Tischler D. Heinke F. Hofmann S. Gröning J.A.D. Labudde D. van Berkel W.J.H. Pyridine nucleotide coenzyme specificity of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase and related flavoprotein monooxygenases.Front. Microbiol. 2018; 9 (30631308): 3017-305010.3389/fmicb.2018.03050Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). McH3H was produced as His-tagged SUMO fusion protein in E. coli NEB10β cells. About 100 mg SUMO-McH3H per liter of culture could be purified using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Based on the amino acid sequence, the theoretical molecular mass of His-tagged SUMO-McH3H is 60 kDa and that of McH3H is 46 kDa. According to SDS-PAGE analysis, the purification indeed resulted in a protein with the predicted mass of the fusion protein (65 kDa) (Fig. S2A). Upon removal of the His-tagged SUMO, untagged McH3H was obtained. Gel permeation experiments with the cleaved McH3H revealed an apparent molecular mass of about 43 kDa (Fig. S2B), indicating that in solution, the enzyme is monomeric. The purified protein had an intense yellow color which is in line with the observation that its sequence contains all hallmark sequence motifs of a class A flavoprotein monooxygenase that typically harbors a tightly bound FAD cofactor. The UV-visible absorption spectrum of McH3H revealed typical flavoprotein features, with absorption maxima at 375 nm and 450 nm (Fig. S3). The A280/A450 was 5.5 and confirms that the enzyme is predominantly in the holo form as the theoretical A280/A450 ratio calculated by using the calculated extinction coefficient at 280 nm and the determined extinction coefficient at 450 nm is 4.8. Treatment with 0.2% SDS resulted in a slightly altered spectrum because of release of the flavin cofactor (Fig. 1). The identity of the cofactor as FAD was confirmed upon treatment with phosphodiesterase which resulted in formation of FMN. Because chloride and other monovalent anions are inhibitors of several class A enzymes, such as PfPHBH, 3HB6H, and PpSALH, chloride and phosphate ions were tested. Yet, no significant effect on the activity (<10%) of McH3H was observed in the presence of 100 mm chloride or phosphate. Before testing activity of McH3H with hispidin, suitable experimental conditions were established. It was found that hispidin absorbs in the visible region and that the UV-visible absorption spectrum of hispidin is highly influenced by pH. This complicates the use of the commonly used assay in which the consumption of NAD(P)H is monitored by measuring the absorbance decrease at 340 nm over time. On top of that, we observed that hispidin seems to decay in certain buffers. Based on the performed tests (several buffer types and pH values), we concluded that potassium phosphate is the most suitable buffer to use as it showed minimal effects on the absorption spectrum of hispidin at different pH values. Hence, all biochemical studies of McH3H were carried out using potassium phosphate buffer. The wavelength for the absorption maximum of hispidin changes with pH (Fig. S4). This is because hispidin contains several hydroxy groups with relatively low pKa values. To avoid pH-induced artifacts on activity measurements, we opted for assaying the enzyme activity by using a dioxygen-sensing device, as McH3H uses molecular oxygen for the hydroxylation of hispidin (Scheme 1). Gratifyingly, we could indeed confirm that McH3H is active on hispidin. Using 100 μm NADPH, 40 μm hispidin and 25 nM McH3H, a rapid consumption of dioxygen was observed. Under the experimental conditions applied, the enzyme shows a rather broad pH optimum, with the highest activity between pH 7.0 and 8.0 (Fig. 2A). The thermal stability of the enzyme at different pH values was analyzed by measuring the apparent melting temperature (Tm) using the ThermoFAD method (26Forneris F. Orru R. Bonivento D. Chiarelli L.R. Mattevi A. ThermoFAD, a Thermofluor®-adapted flavin ad hoc detection system for protein folding and ligand binding.FEBS J. 2009; 276 (19459938): 2833-284010.1111/j.1742-4658.2009.07006.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). This revealed that McH3H is most stable at pH 7.0 with an apparent Tm of 42°C. Based on these results we decided to use 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, as standard buffer for all subsequent experiments. The ThermoFAD method was also used to study the effect of substrate binding on the melting temperature of the enzyme. Interestingly, the Tm was greatly impacted by hispidin: It went from 42°C in the absence of hispidin up to 50°C with apparent saturating hispidin concentrations. This analysis also allowed determination of the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) of hispidin: 45 μm (Fig. S5). For definite proof for the role of McH3H in 3-hydroxyhispidin production, we set out to determine the formed product. The recombinant enzyme was used to transform 1.0 mg hispidin after which the reaction product was isolated and characterized by 1H NMR. It was found that McH3H can indeed catalyze the full transformation of hispidin into 3-hydroxyhispidin (Fig. 3). No other oxidized products were detected. A range of other compounds (including 4-hydroxy-2H-pyrone, 4-methoxy-6-methyl-2H-pyran-one, 2H-pyran-2-one, and various phenols) were also tested as possible substrates (Fig. S6). However, HPLC or GC analysis showed that none of the tested compounds showed any conversion. This suggests that McH3H is extremely specific for hispidin. A narrow substrate acceptance profile is fairly common for class A flavoprotein hydroxylases. To further confirm that the product (3-hydroxyhispidin) formed by action of McH3H is the substrate for the fungal luciferase (McLuz) catalyzed light production, a luminescence reaction experiment was carried out. This revealed that visible (green) light can be observed in a dark environment upon mixing McH3H, NADPH, hispidin, and E. coli cells expressing McLuz (Fig. S7). Omission of any of the components abolished light production. This convincingly shows that McH3H is a true luciferin-producing enzyme. Interestingly, except for identifying hispidin as substrate, McH3H was found to show activity with NADH or NADPH as coenzyme. This is somewhat rare for class A flavoprotein monooxygenases; they are usually rather specific for one nicotinamide coenzyme. To establish whether there was a preference for one of the coenzymes, we carried out steady-state kinetics experiments. The steady-state kinetic parameters were determined at 25°C. Although McH3H displayed similar apparent kcat values for NADPH (6.0 s−1) and NADH (6.7 s−1) in the presence of 50 μm hispidin (Fig. 4, A and B), the Km value for NADPH was significantly lower than for NADH (69 μm versus 240 μm). The apparent Km of the enzyme for hispidin was found to be rather low, with a Km of around 5 μm (Fig. 4, C and D), independent of the used coenzyme. In the absence of hispidin, McH3H also consumed dioxygen and, hence, acted as a slow NAD(P)H oxidase. At 500 μm NADPH or NADH, this activity was 0.2 s−1 and 0.1 s−1, respectively. These results show that hispidin, besides being a substrate, also acts as an effector, strongly stimulating coenzyme consumption. Class A flavoprotein monooxygenases are known to display uncoupling: Consumption of the reduced coenzyme which does not lead to hydroxylation, resulting in hydrogen peroxide formation (27Romero E. Gómez Castellanos J.R. Gadda G. Fraaije M.W. Mattevi A. Same substrate, many reactions: oxygen activation in flavoenzymes.Chem. Rev. 2018; 118 (29323892): 1742-176910.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00650Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The McH3H uncoupling rate was determined by measuring the hydrogen peroxide formation and revealed 30% uncoupling when NADPH was used and 15% uncoupling in the case of NADH. After determining the steady-state kinetics of McH3H, we performed a rapid kinetics analysis of McH3H to elucidate its kinetic mechanism. The reaction cycle of most flavoenzymes typically follows two phases, a reductive half-reaction and an oxidative half-reaction (28Mattevi A. To be or not to be an oxidase: Challenging the oxygen reactivity of flavoenzymes.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31 (16600599): 276-28310.1016/j.tibs.2006.03.003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 29van Berkel W.J.H. Benen J.A.E. Eppink M.H.M. Fraaije M.W.

Mechanisms of flavoprotein-catalyzed reactions.Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181 (2653819): 1-1710.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14688.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). First, the reductive half-reaction was studied by conducting reactions in the absence of dioxygen. Because McH3H shows a preference for NADPH over NADH, the respective rapid kinetics experiments were carried out using NADPH. The dissociation constants of the binary McH3H·NADPH complex and of the ternary McH3H·NADPH·hispidin complex were determined by measuring the reduction rate of the protein at different NADPH concentrations and monitoring the reaction at 450 nm. The reduction rate of the enzyme, although proceeding extremely slow without hispidin, is strongly boosted when hispidin is present (with reduction rates going from 2.7 s−1 to 220 s−1) (Fig. 5, A and B). Clearly, binding of substrate triggers efficient reduction of the flavin cofactor by NADPH. The dissociation constants (Kd) of NADPH for the McH3H·NADPH complex and McH3H·NADPH·hispidin complex were 2.8 mm and 0.8 mm, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). Subsequently, the affinity for hispidin was determined by varying the hispidin concentration while maintaining a fixed concentration of NADPH (Fig. 5C). This corroborated the above findings that the hydroxylase has a high affinity toward its aromatic substrate (Kd,hispidin = 4.1 μm). The redox state of the flavin cofactor was also monitored under aerobic conditions upon mixing the enzyme with only NADPH or with NADPH and hispidin (Fig. 5D). This showed that the enzyme remains mainly in the oxidized state when only NADPH is available. This fully agrees with the slow rate of flavin reduction in the absence of hispidin. When hispidin is present, a fast and significant reduction of the flavin absorbance is observed, reaching an equilibrium after 0.1 s. This suggests that during steady-state kinetics, the rate of reduction is not rate-limiting. This is also expected considering the relatively fast rate of FAD reduction (>200 s−1). The second half of the reaction cycle was studied by mixing the anaerobically reduced enzyme with oxygenated buffer. To follow the oxidative half-reaction, we initially monitored the spectral changes occurring after mixing the fully NADPH-reduced McH3H with aerobic buffer in the absence and presence of substrate. In the absence of substrate, reduced McH3H reacted rapidly with dioxygen, without observing a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate formation. The intermediate typically has an absorbance maximum at 360–390 nm (Fig. 6A). The reaction led to full reoxidation of the FAD cofactor in an apparent single kinetic event. When using 10 μm hispidin in the oxidative half-reaction, a similar fast and full reoxidation was observed (Fig. 6B). The kinetic and spectral changes between these two experiments were minimal, indicating that, even in the presence of hispidin, McH3H is not efficient in stabilizing the oxygenating flavin intermediate. Low-temperature condition (4°C) and the addition of sodium azide did not help to stabilize the hydroperoxyflavin. This observation is in line with the observed poor coupling efficiency (see above). Yet, lack of stabilization of the presumed C4a-(hydro)peroxyflavin species is not an uncommon phenomenon for class A flavoprotein monooxygenases. The dioxygen concentration dependence of the reoxidation kinetics displayed saturating behavior (see insets, Fig. 6). This is somewhat unusual for class A flavoprotein monooxygenases but has been observed in some flavoenzymes (31Sucharitakul J. Prongjit M. Haltrich D. Chaiyen P. Detection of a C4a-hydroperoxyflavin intermediate in the reaction of a flavoprotein oxidase.Biochemistry. 2008; 47 (18652479): 8485-849010.1021/bi801039dCrossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Nicoll C.R.

The preference of McH3H for NADPH was somewhat unanticipated as it shows relatively high sequence identity with other flavoprotein hydroxylases displaying high specificity for NADH. In absence of a crystal structure (crystallization trials of McH3H failed), we generated a homology model using YASARA (33Krieger E. Joo K. Lee J. Lee J. Raman S. Thompson J. Tyka M. Baker D.

The negative slope in phosphate level in group 3 was greater than that in group 1 (ß = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.37, p = 0.032), while the negative slope in the potassium level was greater in group 2 than in group 1(ß = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.17, p = 0.008). Additional intravenous calcium was not used in any case, and most cases of acid-base disturbances were well controlled.The use of phosphate- and potassium-containing with a proper CRRT protocol prevented decreases in serum phosphate and potassium levels, thus also preventing hypophosphatemia and hypokalemia, and additional replacement during CRRT."
https://openalex.org/W3086936414,"We report on an experimental study that was set up to reveal differences in the tendencies of men and women to cooperate in same-sex interactions. Former studies on this subject were mostly conducted in industrialized modern societies. In contrast, we tested the cooperation tendency among Buryats, a people from Southern Siberia of Mongolian origin. All subjects participated in (1) one iterated Public Goods Game in a group of four individuals of the same sex and (2) four one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma games with different partners of the same sex. The interactions were in a face-to-face setting, but any intentional communication during the experiments was prohibited. We found that Buryat men were more cooperative than Buryat women in both types of same-sex interactions. In particular, the fraction of men employing a strategy of unconditional cooperation in the iterated Public Goods Game was much higher (36%) than the fraction of unconditional cooperators among women (21%). In general, the behavior of men was less context dependent than the behavior of women. In both sexes, individuals who were more cooperative in one type of game tended to be more cooperative in the other type of game. Although direct communication was prohibited, the interaction partners in the Prisoner’s Dilemma games employed the same strategy much more frequently than expected by chance. We conclude that, even among strangers, the exchange of subtle signals is sufficient to coordinate strategic decisions."

Recalled breathlessness intensity may differ from experienced intensity and be influenced by the intensity trajectory including the 'peak-end rule'. The primary aim was to test if adding two minutes of low intensity exercise at the end of an exercise test would change the recalled breathlessness. Secondary aims included to analyse the impact of the peak and end exertional breathlessness intensity on breathlessness recall.Randomized controlled trial of 92 adults referred for exercise testing who were randomized (1:1), at test end, to 2 minutes of additional low intensity exercise (intervention; n = 47) or stopping at peak exertion (control; n = 45). Experienced breathlessness during the test and recalled intensity (30 min after the test) was assessed using the Borg CR10 scale.Participants were aged a mean 59 years; 61% men; 79% reported a mMRC ≥1. There was no between-group difference in recalled breathlessness intensity, 5.51 ([95% CI] 5.00 to 6.01) vs. 5.73 (5.27 to 6.20; p = 0.52) in controls, even though the intervention group had a significantly lower end breathlessness (mean difference 0.96; 0.24 to 1.67; p = 0.009). Recalled exertional breathlessness was most strongly related to peak breathlessness (r2 = 0.43). When analyzed together, end breathlessness did not add any explanatory value above that of peak breathlessness.Adding an episode of two minutes of lower exercise and breathlessness intensity at the end of an exercise test did not affect symptom recall, which was most strongly related to peak breathlessness intensity.ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03468205)."

Biallelic mutations in either TMC6 or TMC8 are detected in more than half of cases of the pre-malignant skin disease epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV). It is controversial whether EV induced by mutations in TMC6 or TMC8 originates from keratinocyte or lymphocyte defects.

To study the function of these proteins we generated mice with targeted deletion mutant alleles of Tmc6 or Tmc8.

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that TMC6 and TMC8 formed a protein complex in mouse and human T cells.

We demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 regulated CIB1 levels by protecting CIB1 from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Reciprocally, CIB1 was needed for stabilizing TMC6 and TMC8 levels. These results suggest why inactivating mutations in any of the three human genes leads to similar clinical presentations.

Following identification of TMC1, bioinformatic and genetic analysis revealed seven more human paralogs and mouse sequences with high sequence conservation (1Kurima K. Yang Y. Sorber K. Griffith A.J.

Two other TMC genes, TMC6 and TMC8, were shown to be the previously described EVER1 and EVER2 genes which, when mutated, cause epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV) (9Ramoz N. Rueda L.A. Bouadjar B.

Patients with this disease are susceptible to human papillomavirus (HPV) infections that cause skin lesions that can progress to squamous cell carcinoma. Considered an immunodeficiency disease, it has been controversial whether immune cells, keratinocytes, or both are the primarily affected cell type in EV (10Ovits C.G. Amin B.D. Halverstam C.

The anoctamin family of transmembrane proteins contains 10 members. Evidence for channel and lipid flippase activities of the anoctamins has been presented (12Whitlock J.M. Hartzell H.C.

As with the TMC family, mutations in several anoctamin genes lead to various diseases, and overexpression of some of the anoctamins are implicated in cancer development. Biochemical experiments showed that the anoctamin proteins are expressed as dimers, and structural studies confirmed this topology (13Fallah G. Römer T. Detro-Dassen S. Braam U. Markwardt F.

Of further relevance to our studies is that bioinformatic analysis suggested that the anoctamin and TMC families of proteins are evolutionarily related because they demonstrate sequence similarity and were predicted to have similar membrane topology (15Hahn Y. Kim D.S. Pastan I.H. Lee B. Anoctamin and transmembrane channel-like proteins are evolutionarily related.Int. J. Mol. Med. 2009; 24 (19513534): 51-5510.3892/ijmm_00000205Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Patients with EV without mutations in TMC6 or TMC8 but with null mutations of the CIB1 (calcium- and integrin-binding protein 1) gene have recently been described (16de Jong S.J. Créquer A. Matos I. Hum D. Gunasekharan V. Lorenzo L. Jabot-Hanin F. Imahorn E. Arias A.A. Vahidnezhad H. Youssefian L. Markle J.G. Patin E. D'Amico A. Wang C.Q.F. et al.The human CIB1-EVER1-EVER2 complex governs keratinocyte-intrinsic immunity to β-papillomaviruses.J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 (30068544): 2289-231010.1084/jem.20170308Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that the absence of CIB1 in keratinocytes contributed to the disease in these patients. CIB1 was proposed in this study to be found in complex with TMC6 and TMC8 proteins. Evidence for this hypothesis was indirect because manipulation of TMC6 and TMC8 mRNA levels could affect CIB1 protein levels, and incomplete because only CIB1 proteins could be directly detected. To further define the role of TMC6 and TMC8 in T cell function and in models of EV, we analyzed expression of these genes in murine tissues and generated mice segregating targeted deletion alleles of Tmc6 and Tmc8. To enable studies of the TMC6 and TMC8 proteins, we also generated specific antibodies for both of these proteins. We found that both genes were highly expressed in murine T cells. At the protein level, we demonstrated that TMC6 and TMC8 heterodimerize and confirmed that they form a trimeric complex with CIB1. Levels of both TMC proteins and CIB1 cross-regulate each other. Finally, we found that TMC6 is expressed more than 6.6-fold higher in T cells than in keratinocytes and that expression of TMC8 is very low in keratinocytes. Our data define the existence of a complex containing TMC6-TMC8-CIB1 and provide further basic information relevant to the study of EV. Although TMC6 and TMC8 mutations have been linked to abnormal susceptibility to β-HPV infection and the disease epidermodysplasia verruciformis, little is known about the physiological functions of the channel-like proteins encoded by these genes. To study TMC6 and TMC8 biological functions and to provide a mouse model to investigate EV, we generated mice in which loss-of-function mutations of Tmc6 or Tmc8 alleles (Tmc6Δ or Tmc8Δ, respectively) were generated by recombination-introduced deletions. The molecular strategy was analogous to that used to generate functional null alleles of Tmc1 and Tmc2 (4Kawashima Y. Géléoc G.S. Kurima K. Labay V. Lelli A. Asai Y. Makishima T. Wu D.K. Della Santina C.C. Holt J.R. Griffith A.J. Mechanotransduction in mouse inner ear hair cells requires transmembrane channel-like genes.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121 (22105175): 4796-480910.1172/JCI60405Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). Southern blotting analysis verified the deletions of relevant Tmc6 or Tmc8 genomic DNA fragments (Fig. 1, A and B). We examined Tmc6 and Tmc8 RNA expression in various mouse organs by Northern blotting analysis and observed that Tmc6 and Tmc8 RNA levels were highest in thymus, lung, and spleen among the examined tissues (Fig. 1C). These results are consistent with TMC6 and TMC8 RNA data for human organs, which show that lymphoid tissues such as lymph node and spleen express TMC6 and TMC8 RNA at much higher levels than a variety of other tissues (protein atlas HPA data set, RRID:SCR_006710). Because we found no reliable commercial antibodies specific for TMC6 or TMC8, we analyzed the published protein sequences of these proteins to inform the design of specific immunogens. We observed protein-specific amino acid sequences in their predicted cytosolic carboxyl termini. We generated and expressed chimeric fusion proteins of each of the TMC6- and TMC8-specific C-terminal regions with glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Fig. S1) and used the purified proteins to immunize rabbits. Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-TMC6 and a monoclonal anti-TMC8 were capable of specifically detecting the corresponding TMC proteins in mouse thymocytes by Western blotting. Distinct bands corresponding to TMC6 or TMC8 were seen in lysates from WT thymocytes, whereas the corresponding TMC6 or TMC8 signals were completely missing from Tmc6Δ/Δ or Tmc8Δ/Δ thymocytes (Fig. 1D). Notably, we consistently observed that the relative mobility of the TMC6 band increased (i.e. the molecular weight presumably decreased) and the TMC6 band intensity levels were decreased in Tmc8Δ/Δ mice. TMC8 protein was detected as a doublet in WT thymocytes; however, the upper band of this doublet was absent in Tmc6Δ/Δ thymocytes (Fig. 1D and Fig. S2). All of these changes appeared to occur at the protein level, because qRT-PCR analysis found neither Tmc8 mRNA reduction in Tmc6Δ/Δ thymocytes nor Tmc6 mRNA reduction in Tmc8Δ/Δ thymocytes (Fig. 1E) We also observed high TMC6 and TMC8 protein expression in peripheral lymphocytes. CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and B cells all expressed high levels of TMC6 and TMC8 proteins (Fig. 1F). The crystal structure of the TMC homolog anoctamin or TMEM16 family member nhTMEM16 (from the fungus Nectria hematococca) demonstrated that the anoctamin protein forms a homodimer (14Brunner J.D. Lim N.K. Schenck S. Duerst A. Dutzler R. X-ray structure of a calcium-activated TMEM16 lipid scramblase.Nature. 2014; 516 (25383531): 207-21210.1038/nature13984Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Given that TMC6 and TMC8 reciprocally regulate the expression levels of each other at the protein level (Fig. 1D and Fig. S2), we asked whether TMC6 and TMC8 interact to form a heterodimer. We performed TMC6 and TMC8 reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation assays from mouse thymocyte lysates. Tmc6Δ/Δ and Tmc8Δ/Δ controls were included to confirm that the signals detected by the antibodies were specific. Both TMC6 and TMC8 co-immunoprecipitated with the other protein. By analogy to the anoctamin structure, our results demonstrate that TMC6 and TMC8 indeed form or are components of a heterodimeric complex in mouse thymocytes, though more complex structures are not excluded (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, to demonstrate that human TMC6 and TMC8 can interact, we transfected human Jurkat T cells with FLAG-tagged hTMC6 and HA-tagged hTMC8 (Fig. 2B, transient transfection and Fig. 2C, stable transfection) and used specific anti-peptide tag antibodies for immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. The transiently transfected FLAG-TMC6 and HA-TMC8 protein levels were below the detection limit of high-affinity anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies in cell lysate inputs (Fig. 2B, lanes e–h), suggesting that the proteins were expressed at low levels in the transiently transfected Jurkat cells (transfection efficiencies >60% were observed for a GFP plasmid transfection, data not shown). Nonetheless, the TMC proteins were both clearly seen in the immunoprecipitates brought down by the antibody against the other protein in TMC6- and TMC8-cotransfected cells (Fig. 2B, lanes d and l) but not in any cells transfected only with TMC6 or TMC8 (Fig. 2B, lanes b, c, j, and k). TMC6 and TMC8 proteins were not detected via Western blotting in several mouse T cell lines (data not shown), and it appears that these proteins are endogenously expressed at low levels in Jurkat cells. We then performed stable transduction or transfection of TMC6 and TMC8 into Jurkat cells and screened to acquire clones in which the tagged TMC6 and TMC8 were detectable via Western blotting for Fig. 2C and later experiments. Again, co-immunoprecipitation of TMC6 with TMC8 was seen in the anti-HA (TMC8) immunoprecipitates from cells stably coexpressing TMC6 and TMC8 (Fig. 2C). Tmc6Δ/Δ and Tmc8Δ/Δ mice bred and grew normally. No general abnormalities were observed up to the age of 18 months. Because high TMC6 and TMC8 expression were seen in lymphocytes, including T cells, and T cells play a critical role in immune defense against various infections, we characterized T cell development in Tmc6Δ/Δ and Tmc8Δ/Δ mice. We did not detect a major defect in T cell subset numbers or function. As an alternative approach to determine the function of these proteins, we turned to using MS to identify TMC6- and TMC8-interacting proteins to gain insight into the potential molecular basis of their physiological functions. Given that TMC6 and TMC8 interact and that their expression levels reciprocally affect each other, TMC6 and TMC8 protein complex formation might be important for TMC6 and TMC8 regulation of other proteins. Thus, we used Jurkat cells that were stably transfected with both TMC6 and TMC8 to identify additional interacting proteins. TMC6 or TMC8 peptides were detected by MS in the corresponding protein immunoprecipitates bound by anti-HA or anti-FLAG Ab. There were nearly comparable numbers of TMC6 or TMC8 peptide spectrum matches (PSMs) to the PSMs of the other host proteins detected by MS in the TMC6 or TMC8 immunoprecipitates (Fig. S3). These results again indicate a strong interaction between TMC6 and TMC8, as seen in Fig. 2. Notably, large numbers of calcium and integrin-binding protein 1 (CIB1) PSMs were also detected in both TMC6 and TMC8 immunoprecipitates from cells cotransfected with TMC6 and TMC8 but not from control cells (Fig. S3, A and B). Other abundant PSMs were not specifically co-immunoprecipitated. These results support the previous observation of CIB1 as a protein interacting with TMC6 and TMC8 in a study of overexpressed proteins in HEK293 cells (16de Jong S.J. Créquer A. Matos I. Hum D. Gunasekharan V. Lorenzo L. Jabot-Hanin F. Imahorn E. Arias A.A. Vahidnezhad H. Youssefian L. Markle J.G. Patin E. D'Amico A. Wang C.Q.F. et al.The human CIB1-EVER1-EVER2 complex governs keratinocyte-intrinsic immunity to β-papillomaviruses.J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215 (30068544): 2289-231010.1084/jem.20170308Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We verified, using Western blotting analysis, that endogenous CIB1 indeed co-immunoprecipitated with TMC6 and TMC8 in Jurkat cells transfected to stably express these two proteins (Fig. 3A). Markedly more CIB1 was detected in the TMC8 immunoprecipitates in cells transfected with and expressing both TMC6 and TMC8 than in cells transfected only with TMC8, suggesting that TMC6 and TMC8 complex formation enhances the TMC8-CIB1 interaction (Fig. 3B). Importantly, we also demonstrated that endogenous TMC6 and TMC8 interact with endogenous CIB1 in mouse thymocytes in a similar co-immunoprecipitation study (Fig. 3C). These results are consistent with the idea that TMC6, TMC8, and CIB1 form a heterotrimeric protein complex in cells. To verify this possibility experimentally, we treated Jurkat cells expressing the stable FLAG-TMC6 and HA-TMC8 with or without the cleavable cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP). Detergent lysates from these two preparations were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred for blotting under nonreducing conditions. In addition to the 17-kDa monomeric CIB1 band, CIB1 antibody detected another ∼200-kDa band containing CIB1 only in the preparation treated with DSP (Fig. 3D). The ∼200 kDa size is consistent with the sum of molecular weights of monomeric CIB1, TMC6, and TMC8. A similar preparation was treated identically but was not transferred. The region of this second gel containing the 200-kDa band was excised and subjected to elution in the presence of the reducing agent DTT. The eluents from noncrosslinked and crosslinked reduced proteins from the 200-kDa region were re-electrophoresed, transferred, and subjected to immunoblotting. The specifically crosslinked and subsequently reduced 200-kDa band did indeed contain monomeric CIB1, TMC6, and TMC8, thus demonstrating that these molecules form a heterotrimer (Fig. 3E). In addition to interacting with CIB1, TMC6 and TMC8 coexpression robustly elevated CIB1 levels in Jurkat cells. TMC6 or TMC8 transfection alone was sufficient to elevate CIB1 levels (Fig. 4A, Triton buffer lysates, and Fig. 4B, more stringent RIPA buffer lysates). Comparison of cells transfected only with TMC6 or TMC8 to cells transfected with both, as shown in Fig. 4B, suggested that coexpression and thus TMC6-TMC8 complex formation may further enhance the capacity of TMC6 and TMC8 to regulate CIB1 levels. Additionally, coexpression of TMC6 and TMC8 largely increased the detectable fraction of the larger species of the other protein. Coexpression of TMC6 also elevated TMC8 band intensities (Fig. 4B). These results from our analysis of transfected human lymphocytes can be compared with our findings in murine cells, in which a decrease in levels and molecular sizes of the TMC6 and TMC8 proteins were observed in thymocytes of the Tmc6Δ/Δ or Tmc8Δ/Δ mice (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, a decrease in CIB1 protein level was seen in Tmc6Δ/Δ and Tmc8Δ/Δ mouse thymocytes (Fig. 4C) and lymph node cells (Fig. 4D). To understand how levels of TMC6 and TMC8 affect CIB1 levels, we first performed qRT-PCR analysis to compare the RNA levels of Cib1, Tmc6, and Tmc8 in TMC6- and TMC8-doubly expressing Jurkat cells and control vector-transfected cells. As expected, Tmc6 and Tmc8 levels were substantially higher in the TMC6- and TMC8-expressing cells than in the control cells. However, Cib1 RNA levels remained the same in those cells (Fig. 5A). In addition, Cib1 RNA levels did not change in Tmc6Δ/Δ or Tmc8Δ/Δ thymocytes (Fig. S4). These results suggest that post-translational rather than transcriptional processes led to the robust elevation of CIB1 protein levels observed with TMC6 and TMC8 expression. We examined whether CIB1 levels are regulated by proteasomal degradation by treating cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Given that Jurkat cells are sensitive to apoptosis induced by proteasomal inhibitors, our analysis was limited by doses and duration of MG-132 treatment. Nevertheless, MG-132 treatment for 6–7 h elevated CIB1 levels in both parental (Fig. 5B) and vector-transfected Jurkat cells (Fig. 5C). The CIB1 level changes induced by MG-132 treatment were not detected in the TMC6/TMC8 doubly transfected cells (Fig. 5C), indicating that TMC6 and TMC8 expression can protect CIB1 from proteasomal degradation. We also analyzed CIB1 ubiquitination via immunoblotting of CIB1 immunoprecipitates with an anti-ubiquitin antibody. To eliminate the possibility that the detected protein ubiquitination may come from other complexed proteins, we heated the cell lysates in 1% SDS to disrupt protein interaction prior to immunoprecipitation. Indeed, polyubiquitination of CIB1 was detected in control vector-transfected cells, and CIB1 ubiquitination was elevated by MG-132 treatment. Less CIB1 polyubiquitination (in terms of the ratio relative to total protein amounts and polyubiquitin chain length) was seen in TMC6- and TMC8-expressing cells (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that TMC6 and TMC8 stabilize CIB1 by protecting CIB1 from ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We then evaluated whether CIB1 also regulates TMC6 and TMC8 levels. We used siRNA transfection to knock down endogenous CIB1 expression in Jurkat cells and then assayed for a change in the levels of FLAG-TMC6 and HA-TMC8 proteins. Two different CIB1 siRNAs each efficiently inhibited CIB1 expression (Fig. 6A). Notably, both FLAG-TMC6 and HA-TMC8 protein levels were substantially decreased in CIB1 siRNA-transfected cells, indicating that normal CIB1 expression is required for full TMC6 and TMC8 protein stability. We also assessed whether the TMC6-TMC8 interaction is mediated by CIB1 by performing a TMC6 and TMC8 co-immunoprecipitation assay after CIB1 knockdown (Fig. 6B). In the lysate controls (lanes d–f), both CIB1 siRNAs again resulted in marked decreases of CIB1 and both TMC6 and TMC8 protein levels. In the anti-FLAG-TMC6 immunoprecipitations (lanes a–c), despite a reduction in its level, a substantial amount of HA-TMC8 still co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-TMC6 in cells subjected to CIB1 knockdown. The ratio of TMC6 and TMC8 in the immunoprecipitation lanes did not differ from that observed in the lysate inputs in CIB1-inhibited cells. This result is consistent with the conclusion that TMC6 and TMC8 interaction does not require CIB1. Defects in both T cells and keratinocytes have been thought to be responsible for the development of EV (10Ovits C.G. Amin B.D. Halverstam C.

We used our TMC6 and TMC8 antibodies to compare TMC6, TMC8, and CIB1 protein levels in lymphocytes and keratinocytes. We determined and compared TMC6 and TMC8 levels and CIB1 levels in adult mouse epidermal cells and thymocytes. In contrast to thymocytes, TMC6 and TMC8 were not detectable in epidermal cells (Fig. S5A). As seen in Fig. 4C, CIB1 levels were dramatically down-regulated in both Tmc6Δ/Δ and Tmc8Δ/Δ thymocytes (Fig. 7A). However, CIB1 levels were reduced in Tmc6Δ/Δ epidermal cells but not in Tmc8Δ/Δ epidermal cells compared with WT epidermal cells (Fig. 7A). The possibility might exist that the failure to detect TMC6 or TMC8 in epidermal cells is caused by trypsin cleavage of the transmembrane proteins during epidermal cell suspension preparation. Some portion of lymphocytes and other types of immune cells are also present in the epidermal cell suspension (17Kobayashi T. Glatz M. Horiuchi K. Kawasaki H. Akiyama H. Kaplan D.H. Kong H.H. Amagai M. Nagao K. Dysbiosis and Staphylococcus aureus colonization drives inflammation in atopic dermatitis.Immunity. 2015; 42 (25902485): 756-76610.1016/j.immuni.2015.03.014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also performed a commonly adopted procedure (18Lichti U. Anders J. Yuspa S.H. Isolation and short-term culture of primary keratinocytes, hair follicle populations and dermal cells from newborn mice and keratinocytes from adult mice for in vitro analysis and for grafting to immunodeficient mice.Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3 (18451788): 799-81010.1038/nprot.2008.50Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) to obtain relatively pure keratinocytes and analyzed TMC6, TMC8, and CIB1 in cultured primary keratinocytes. The cells were cultured in low-calcium media that prevents keratinocyte differentiation to retain the original status of the isolated keratinocytes. TMC6 was detected in primary keratinocytes isolated from C57BL/6 mice, but the levels were 6.6-fold less than in thymocytes (Fig. 7B and Fig. S5B). A similar result was also observed for FVB mice (Fig. S5C). TMC8 was not detectable in cultured keratinocytes from either C57BL/6 or FVB mice (Fig. 7B and Fig. S5C). These results for mouse keratinocytes and lymphocytes are similar to those for the amounts of TMC6 and TMC8 RNA in human skin and lymphoid tissues (RRID:SCR_006710). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the TMC6-TMC8-CIB1 complex was much more easily detected in thymocytes than in keratinocytes of C57BL/6 (Fig. 7B) and FVB mice (Fig. S5C). Furthermore, compared with WT cells, little CIB1 reduction was observed in Tmc6Δ/Δ primary keratinocytes (Fig. 7C). These results demonstrate that TMC6 levels are low, TMC8 levels are lower or nonexistent, and therefore a TMC6-TMC8-CIB1 complex is not present or only present at extremely low levels in mouse keratinocytes. By RNA analysis and protein assays using custom-made antibodies, we observed that TMC6 and TMC8 are highly expressed in lymphocytes. TMC6 and TMC8 are frequently coexpressed in virtually all lymphoid tissues (RRID:SCR_006710). The high expression in lymphocytes distinguishes TMC6 and TMC8 from other TMC proteins, which are usually most abundant in epithelial cells (1Kurima K. Yang Y. Sorber K. Griffith A.J.

https://openalex.org/W3086981772,"Clear-cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC) can be divided into four transcriptomic subtypes, two of which have a favorable and two an unfavorable prognosis. To assess mechanisms driving these subtypes, we investigated their miRNA expression patterns. miRNAs are master regulators of mRNAs, that are widely deregulated in cancer. Unsupervised clustering in our dataset (n = 128) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) validation set identified two distinct miRNA clusters that overlapped with the transcriptomic subtypes, underscoring the validity of these subtypes on a multi-omics level and suggesting a driving role for miRNAs. Discriminatory miRNAs for the favorable subtypes repressed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, based on gene set enrichment analysis and target-mRNA expression levels. Strikingly, throughout the entire dataset, miRNAs associated with favorable subtypes were also associated with longer overall survival after diagnosis, and miRNAs associated with unfavorable subtypes with shorter overall survival (Pearson r = -0.54, p<0.0001). These findings indicate a general shift in miRNA expression between more and less aggressive tumors. This adds to current literature, which usually suggests only a small subset of miRNAs as markers of aggressive disease. In conclusion, this study reveals distinct mRNA expression patterns underlying transcriptomic ccRCC-subtypes, whereby miRNAs associated with favorable subtypes counteract epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. There is a general shift in miRNA expression in ccRCC, between more and less aggressive tumors."

This study addressed a novel method for inactivating Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the causative agent of WNS, using ultraviolet A (UVA) or B (UVB) radiation in combination with methoxsalen, a photosensitizer from the furanocoumarin family of compounds. Fungal spore suspensions were diluted in micromolar concentrations of methoxsalen (50–500 μM), then exposed to fixed doses of UVA radiation (500–5000 mJ/cm2), followed by plating on germination media. These plates were examined for two to four weeks for evidence of spore germination or inactivation, along with resultant growth or inhibition of P. destructans colonies. Pretreatment of fungal spores with low doses of methoxsalen resulted in a UVA dose-dependent inactivation of the P. destructans spores. All doses of methoxsalen paired with 500 mJ/cm2 of UVA led to an approximate two-log10 (~99%) reduction in spore viability, and when paired with 1000 mJ/cm2, a four-log10 or greater (>99.99%) reduction in spore viability was observed. Additionally, actively growing P. destructans colonies treated directly with methoxsalen and either UVA or UVB radiation demonstrated UV dose-dependent inhibition and termination of colony growth. This novel approach of using a photosensitizer in combination with UV radiation to control fungal growth may have broad, practical application in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3084623999,"Understanding the spread of invasive species in many regions is difficult because surveys are rare. Here, historical records of the invasive marine mussel, Semimytilus algosus, on the shores of Angola and Namibia are synthesised to re-construct its invasive history. Since this mussel was first discovered in Namibia about 90 years ago, it has spread throughout the western coast of southern Africa. By the late 1960s, the species was well established across a range of 1005 km of coastline in southern Angola and northern Namibia. Although only coarse spatial resolution data are available since the 1990s, the distribution of S. algosus clearly increased substantially over the subsequent decades. Today, the species is distributed over 2785 km of coastline, appearing in southern Namibia in 2014, whence it spread across the border to northern South Africa in 2017, and in northern Angola in 2015. Conspicuously, its current range appears to be relatively contiguous across at least 810 km of shore in southern Angola and throughout Namibia, with isolated, spatially disjunct occurrences towards the southern and northern limits of its distribution. Despite there being few occurrence records that are unevenly distributed spatially and temporally, data for the distributional patterns of S. algosus in Angola and Namibia provide invaluable insights into how marine invasive species spread in developing regions that are infrequently monitored."

Datasets (GSE80587, GSE65267 and GSE116299) correlated to folic acid were screened in the Gene Expression Omnibus. Weighed gene co-expression network analysis was performed to identify modules associated with sample traits of folic acid and organs (brain, prostate and kidney). Functional enrichment analysis was performed for the eigengenes in modules that were significantly correlated with sample traits. Accordingly, the hub genes and key nodes in the modules were identified using the protein interaction network. A total of 17,252 genes in three datasets were identified. One module, which included 97 genes that were highly correlated with sample traits (including folic acid treatment [cor = -0.57, P = 3e-04] and kidney [cor = -0.68, p = 4e-06]), was screened out. Hub genes, including tetratricopeptide repeat protein 38 (Ttc38) and miR-185, as well as those (including Sema3A, Insl3, Dll1, Msh4 and Snai1) associated with ""neuropilin binding"", ""regulation of reproductive process"" and ""vitamin D metabolic process"", were identified. Genes, including Ttc38, Sema3A, Insl3, Dll1, Msh4 and Snai1, were the novel factors that may be associated with the development of the kidneys and related to folic acid treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3086019693,"Periodontitis (PD) is a chronic inflammatory process resulting from the relationship of the immune response with the components in dental plaque. Cytokines and their genetic polymorphisms seem to be involved in the immunopathogenesis of this disease. This study aimed to evaluate the correlation of IL16 polymorphism with PD. A case-control study was conducted in a sample of individuals from southern Brazil. The genotyping of IL16, rs11556218 T>G, rs4072111 C>T e rs4778889 T>C, was performed using the PCR-RFLP methodology. The serum level of IL-16 was determined using an IL-16 ELISA kit for humans. SNPStats and OpenEpi software and Wilcoxon's U test were used to perform statistical analysis. IL16 rs11556218 polymorphism was significantly associated to PD in nonsmoking patients: individuals with G/G genotype were less likely to develop PD compared to the T/T genotype (OR = 0.10; Pc = 0.019, codominant model). In addition, the TTT haplotype was associated with a high risk for PD (OR = 2.45; P = 0.01). A low IL-16 serum level was observed among individuals with PD when compared to controls (P = 0.027). Thus, the IL16 rs16556218 polymorphism and the serum levels of IL-16 were associated with periodontitis in a Brazilian sample, and this was influenced by environmental factors such as smoking."

To report the effect of an outpatient copayment scheme on health outcomes of hypertensive adults in a community-managed population in Xinjiang, we compared changes in outcomes between insured and uninsured groups from baseline to the first follow-up appointment in a community-managed hypertensive population and evaluated these changes based on propensity score matching and the difference-in-difference method. A total of 1,095 individuals in a community-managed hypertension population were selected for investigation at baseline, among which 805 (73.5%) had follow-up data and 749 (68.4%) were included in our analysis. After accounting for the self-reported severity of hypertension and individual characteristics, there were statistically significant improvements in drug treatment of hypertension and self-reported health. We also found increases in drug treatment for hypertension between groups, after correcting for confounding variables (Odds Ratio, OR 8.05, 95% Confidence interval, CI, 1.31-49.35), and in self-reported health between groups after correcting confounders (OR 1.96, 95% CI, 1.12 to 3.42). Adjusted estimates (confounding variables) were corrected for age, sex, income, marital status, education level, employment, family size, self-reported severity of hypertension, course of hypertension, and number of medications. As a result, decreased outpatient copayment was associated with an increase in antihypertensive treatment coverage, and an improvement in self-reported health among community-managed hypertensive populations in Xinjiang, China."
https://openalex.org/W3084654199,"This research mainly aims to develop a generalized cure rate model, estimate the proportion of cured patients and their survival rate, and identify the risk factors associated with infectious diseases. The generalized cure rate model is based on bounded cumulative hazard function, which is a non-mixture model, and is developed using a two-parameter Weibull distribution as the baseline distribution, to estimate the cure rate using maximum likelihood method and real data with R and STATA software. The results showed that the cure rate of tuberculosis (TB) patients was 26.3%, which was higher than that of TB patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; 23.1%). The non-parametric median survival time of TB patients was 51 months, while that of TB patients co-infected with HIV was 33 months. Moreover, no risk factors were associated with TB patients co-infected with HIV, while age was a significant risk factor for TB patients among the suspected risk factors considered. Furthermore, the bounded cumulative hazard function was extended to accommodate infectious diseases with co-infections by deriving an appropriate probability density function, determining the distribution, and using real data. Governments and related health authorities are also encouraged to take appropriate actions to combat infectious diseases with possible co-infections."
https://openalex.org/W3085620771,"Herding has often been blamed as one of the possible causes of market instabilities, ultimately yielding to bubbles and crushes. On the other hand, researchers hypothesized that financial systems may benefit from the so-called wisdom of the crowd. To solve this apparent dichotomy, we leverage a novel financial market model, where the agents form their expectations by combining their individual return estimation with the expectations of their neighbors. By establishing a link between herding, sociality, and market instabilities, we point out that the emergence of collective decisions in the market is not necessarily detrimental. Indeed, when all the agents tend to conform their expectations to those of one or few leaders, herding might dramatically reduce market efficiency. However, when each agent accounts for a plurality of opinions, thus following the wisdom of the crowd, market dynamics become efficient. Following these observations, we propose two alternative control strategies to reduce market instability and enhance its efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3086374469,"Aberrant expression of the transcription factor ERG is a key driving event in approximately one-half of all of prostate cancers. Lacking an enzymatic pocket and mainly disordered, the structure of ERG is difficult to exploit for therapeutic design. We recently identified EWS as a specific interacting partner of ERG that is required for oncogenic function. In this study, we aimed to target this specific protein-protein interaction with small molecules. A high-throughput screening (HTS) strategy was implemented to identify potential protein-protein interaction inhibitors. Secondary assays verified the function of several hit compounds, and one lead compound inhibited ERG-mediated phenotypes in prostate cells. This is the first study aimed at targeting the ERG-EWS protein-protein interaction for the development of a small molecule-based prostate cancer therapy."
