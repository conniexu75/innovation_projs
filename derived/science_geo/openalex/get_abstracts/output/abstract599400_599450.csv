https://openalex.org/W2769373029,"Microplastic particles are ubiquitous not only in marine but also in freshwater ecosystems. However, the impacts of microplastics, consisting of a large variety of synthetic polymers, on freshwater organisms remains poorly understood. We examined the effects of two polymer mixtures on the morphology, life history and on the molecular level of the waterflea Daphnia magna (three different clones). Microplastic particles of ~40 μm were supplied at a low concentration (1% of the food particles) leading to an average of ~30 particles in the digestive tract which reflects a high microplastic contamination but still resembles a natural situation. Neither increased mortality nor changes on the morphological (body length, width and tail spine length) or reproductive parameters were observed for adult Daphnia. The analyses of juvenile Daphnia revealed a variety of small and rather subtle responses of morphological traits (body length, width and tail spine length). For adult Daphnia, alterations in expression of genes related to stress responses (i.e. HSP60, HSP70 & GST) as well as of other genes involved in body function and body composition (i.e. SERCA) were observed already 48h after exposure. We anticipate that the adverse effects of microplastic might be influenced by many additional factors like size, shape, type and even age of the particles and that the rather weak effects, as detected in a laboratory, may lead to reduced fitness in a natural multi-stressor environment."

The clinical management of meningioma is guided by tumor grade and biological behavior. Currently, the assessment of tumor grade follows surgical resection and histopathologic review. Reliable techniques for pre-operative determination of tumor grade may enhance clinical decision-making.


Methods 
A total of 175 meningioma patients (103 low-grade and 72 high-grade) with pre-operative contrast-enhanced T1-MRI were included. Fifteen radiomic (quantitative) and 10 semantic (qualitative) features were applied to quantify the imaging phenotype. Area under the curve (AUC) and odd ratios (OR) were computed with multiple-hypothesis correction. Random-forest classifiers were developed and validated on an independent dataset (n = 44).


Results 
Twelve radiographic features (eight radiomic and four semantic) were significantly associated with meningioma grade. High-grade tumors exhibited necrosis/hemorrhage (ORsem = 6.6, AUCrad = 0.62–0.68), intratumoral heterogeneity (ORsem = 7.9, AUCrad = 0.65), non-spherical shape (AUCrad = 0.61), and larger volumes (AUCrad = 0.69) compared to low-grade tumors. Radiomic and sematic classifiers could significantly predict meningioma grade (AUCsem = 0.76 and AUCrad = 0.78). Furthermore, combining them increased the classification power (AUCradio = 0.86). Clinical variables alone did not effectively predict tumor grade (AUCclin = 0.65) or show complementary value with imaging data (AUCcomb = 0.84).


Conclusions 
We found a strong association between imaging features of meningioma and histopathologic grade, with ready application to clinical management. Combining qualitative and quantitative radiographic features significantly improved classification power."
https://openalex.org/W2767379958,"Background Current levels and dangers of opioid use in the U.S. warrant the investigation of harm-reducing treatment alternatives. Purpose A preliminary, historical, cohort study was used to examine the association between enrollment in the New Mexico Medical Cannabis Program (MCP) and opioid prescription use. Methods Thirty-seven habitual opioid using, chronic pain patients (mean age = 54 years; 54% male; 86% chronic back pain) enrolled in the MCP between 4/1/2010 and 10/3/2015 were compared to 29 non-enrolled patients (mean age = 60 years; 69% male; 100% chronic back pain). We used Prescription Monitoring Program opioid records over a 21 month period (first three months prior to enrollment for the MCP patients) to measure cessation (defined as the absence of opioid prescriptions activity during the last three months of observation) and reduction (calculated in average daily intravenous [IV] morphine dosages). MCP patient-reported benefits and side effects of using cannabis one year after enrollment were also collected. Results By the end of the 21 month observation period, MCP enrollment was associated with 17.27 higher age- and gender-adjusted odds of ceasing opioid prescriptions (CI 1.89 to 157.36, p = 0.012), 5.12 higher odds of reducing daily prescription opioid dosages (CI 1.56 to 16.88, p = 0.007), and a 47 percentage point reduction in daily opioid dosages relative to a mean change of positive 10.4 percentage points in the comparison group (CI -90.68 to -3.59, p = 0.034). The monthly trend in opioid prescriptions over time was negative among MCP patients (-0.64mg IV morphine, CI -1.10 to -0.18, p = 0.008), but not statistically different from zero in the comparison group (0.18mg IV morphine, CI -0.02 to 0.39, p = 0.081). Survey responses indicated improvements in pain reduction, quality of life, social life, activity levels, and concentration, and few side effects from using cannabis one year after enrollment in the MCP (ps<0.001). Conclusions The clinically and statistically significant evidence of an association between MCP enrollment and opioid prescription cessation and reductions and improved quality of life warrants further investigations on cannabis as a potential alternative to prescription opioids for treating chronic pain."

https://openalex.org/W2769167396,"Action potentials clustered into high-frequency bursts play distinct roles in neural computations. However, little is known about ionic currents that control the duration and probability of these bursts. We found that, in cartwheel inhibitory interneurons of the dorsal cochlear nucleus, the likelihood of bursts and the interval between their spikelets were controlled by Ca2+ acting across two nanodomains, one between plasma membrane P/Q Ca2+ channels and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ryanodine receptors and another between ryanodine receptors and large-conductance, voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channels. Each spike triggered Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from the ER immediately beneath somatic, but not axonal or dendritic, plasma membrane. Moreover, immunolabeling demonstrated close apposition of ryanodine receptors and BK channels. Double-nanodomain coupling between somatic plasma membrane and hypolemmal ER cisterns provides a unique mechanism for rapid control of action potentials on the millisecond timescale."
https://openalex.org/W2769450342,"Background It has been reported that folic acid supplementation before and/or during pregnancy could reduce the risk of congenital heart defects (CHDs). However, the results from limited epidemiologic studies have been inconclusive. We investigated the associations between maternal folic acid supplementation, dietary folate intake, and the risk of CHDs. Methods A birth cohort study was conducted in 2010–2012 at the Gansu Provincial Maternity & Child Care Hospital in Lanzhou, China. After exclusion of stillbirths and multiple births, a total of 94 births were identified with congenital heart defects, and 9,993 births without any birth defects. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate the associations. Results Compared to non-users, folic acid supplement users before pregnancy had a reduced risk of overall CHDs (OR: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.21–0.86, Ptrend = 0.025) after adjusted for potential confounders. A protective effect was observed for certain subtypes of CHDs (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.16–0.85 for malformation of great arteries; 0.26, 0.10–0.68 for malformation of cardiac septa; 0.34, 0.13–0.93 for Atrial septal defect). A similar protective effect was also seen for multiple CHDs (OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.26–0.93, Ptrend = 0.004). Compared with the middle quartiles of dietary folate intake, lower dietary folate intake (<149.88 μg/day) during pregnancy were associated with increased risk of overall CHDs (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.01–2.62) and patent ductus arteriosus (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.03–3.32). Women who were non-user folic acid supplement and lower dietary folate intake have almost 2-fold increased CHDs risk in their offspring. Conclusions Our study suggested that folic acid supplementation before pregnancy was associated with a reduced risk of CHDs, lower dietary folate intake during pregnancy was associated with increased risk. The observed associations varied by CHD subtypes. A synergistic effect of dietary folate intake and folic acid supplementation was also observed."
https://openalex.org/W2767355593,"Objectives To characterize effects of chronically elevated blood pressure on the brain, we tested for brain white matter microstructural differences associated with normotension, pre-hypertension and hypertension in recently available brain magnetic resonance imaging data from 4659 participants without known neurological or psychiatric disease (62.3±7.4 yrs, 47.0% male) in UK Biobank. Methods For assessment of white matter microstructure, we used measures derived from neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) including the intracellular volume fraction (an estimate of neurite density) and isotropic volume fraction (an index of the relative extra-cellular water diffusion). To estimate differences associated specifically with blood pressure, we applied propensity score matching based on age, sex, educational level, body mass index, and history of smoking, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease to perform separate contrasts of non-hypertensive (normotensive or pre-hypertensive, N = 2332) and hypertensive (N = 2337) individuals and of normotensive (N = 741) and pre-hypertensive (N = 1581) individuals (p<0.05 after Bonferroni correction). Results The brain white matter intracellular volume fraction was significantly lower, and isotropic volume fraction was higher in hypertensive relative to non-hypertensive individuals (N = 1559, each). The white matter isotropic volume fraction also was higher in pre-hypertensive than in normotensive individuals (N = 694, each) in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus and the right superior thalamic radiation, where the lower intracellular volume fraction was observed in the hypertensives relative to the non-hypertensive group. Significance Pathological processes associated with chronically elevated blood pressure are associated with imaging differences suggesting chronic alterations of white matter axonal structure that may affect cognitive functions even with pre-hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2769029334,"Background Existing operational definitions of frailty are personnel-costly and time-consuming, resulting in estimates with a small sample size that cannot be generalized to the population level. The objectives were to develop a multimorbidity frailty index using Taiwan’s claim database, and to understand its ability to predict adverse event. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study. Subjects aged 65 to 100 years who have full National Health Insurance coverage in 2005 were included. We constructed the multimorbidity frailty index using cumulative deficit approach and categorized study population according to the multimorbidity frailty index quartiles: fit, mild frailty, moderate frailty and severe frailty. The multimorbidity frailty index included deficits from outpatient and inpatient diagnosis. Associations with all-cause mortality, unplanned hospitalization and intensive care unit admission were assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analyses. Results The multimorbidity frailty index incorporated 32 deficits, with mean multimorbidity frailty index score of 0.052 (standard deviation = 0.060) among 86,133 subjects included. Compared to subjects in fit category, subjects with severe frailty were associated with a 5.0-fold (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR 4.97; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 4.49–5.50) increased risk of death at 1 year after adjusting for age and gender. Subjects with moderate frailty or mild frailty was associated with 3.1- (adjusted HR 3.08; 95% CI 2.80–3.39) or 1.9- (adjusted HR 1.86; 95% CI 1.71–2.01) folds increased risk, respectively.4.49–5.50). The risk trend of unplanned hospitalization and intensive care unit admission is similar among the study population. Besides, the association between the frailty categories and all three outcomes was slightly stronger among women. Conclusion The multimorbidity frailty index was highly associated with all-cause mortality, unplanned hospitalization and ICU admission. It could serve as an efficient tool for stratifying older adults into different risk groups for planning care management programs."
https://openalex.org/W2619993245,"A long-term goal of AI is to produce agents that can learn a diversity of skills throughout their lifetimes and continuously improve those skills via experience. A longstanding obstacle towards that goal is catastrophic forgetting, which is when learning new information erases previously learned information. Catastrophic forgetting occurs in artificial neural networks (ANNs), which have fueled most recent advances in AI. A recent paper proposed that catastrophic forgetting in ANNs can be reduced by promoting modularity, which can limit forgetting by isolating task information to specific clusters of nodes and connections (functional modules). While the prior work did show that modular ANNs suffered less from catastrophic forgetting, it was not able to produce ANNs that possessed task-specific functional modules, thereby leaving the main theory regarding modularity and forgetting untested. We introduce diffusion-based neuromodulation, which simulates the release of diffusing, neuromodulatory chemicals within an ANN that can modulate (i.e. up or down regulate) learning in a spatial region. On the simple diagnostic problem from the prior work, diffusion-based neuromodulation 1) induces task-specific learning in groups of nodes and connections (task-specific localized learning), which 2) produces functional modules for each subtask, and 3) yields higher performance by eliminating catastrophic forgetting. Overall, our results suggest that diffusion-based neuromodulation promotes task-specific localized learning and functional modularity, which can help solve the challenging, but important problem of catastrophic forgetting."
https://openalex.org/W2770467039,"Inter-brain synchronization during joint actions is a core question in social neuroscience, and the differential contribution of intra- and inter-brain functional connectivity has yet to be clarified along with the role of psychological variables such as perceived self-efficacy. The cognitive performance and the neural activation underlying the execution of joint actions were recorded by functional Near-Infrared imaging during a synchronicity game. An 8-channel array of optodes was positioned over the frontal and prefrontal regions. During the task, the dyads received reinforcing feedback that was experimentally manipulated to induce adoption of common strategies. Intra- and inter-brain connectivity indices were computed along with an inter-brain/intra-brain connectivity index (ConIndex). Finally, correlation analyses were run to assess the relationship between behavioral and physiological levels. The results showed that the external feedback could modulate participant responses in both behavioral and neural components. After the reinforcing manipulation, there were faster response times and increased inter-brain connectivity, and ConIndex emerged primarily over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Additionally, the presence of significant correlations between response times and inter-brain connectivity revealed that only the ""two-players connection"" may guarantee an efficient performance. The present study provides a significant contribution to the identification of intra- and inter-brain functional connectivity when social reinforcement is provided."
https://openalex.org/W2769004789,"The persistence of food insecurity, malnutrition, increasing adiposity, and decreasing physical activity, heightens the need to understand relationships between body image satisfaction, eating attitudes, BMI and physical activity levels in South Africa. Females aged 18–23 years were recruited from rural (n = 509) and urban (n = 510) settings. Body image satisfaction was measured using Stunkard’s silhouettes, and the 26-item Eating Attitudes questionnaire (EAT-26) was used to evaluate participants’ risk of disordered eating. Minutes per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was assessed using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). Significant linear correlates were included in a series of regressions run separately for urban and rural participants. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the relationships between variables. Urban females were more likely to be overweight and obese than rural females (p = 0.02), and had a greater desire to be thinner (p = 0.02). In both groups, being overweight or obese was positively associated with a desire to be thinner (p<0.01), and negatively associated with a desire to be fatter (p<0.01). Having a disordered eating attitude was associated with body image dissatisfaction in the urban group (β = 1.27, p<0.01, CI: 0.38; 2.16), but only with a desire to be fatter in the rural group (β = 0.63, p = 0.04, CI: 0.03; 1.23). In the SEM model, body image dissatisfaction was associated with disordered eating (β = 0.63), as well as higher MVPA participation (p<0.01). These factors were directly associated with a decreased risk of disordered eating attitude, and with a decreased desire to be thinner. Findings indicate a shift in both settings towards more Westernised ideals. Physical activity may provide a means to promote a healthy body image, while reducing the risk of disordered eating. Given the high prevalence of overweight and obesity in both rural and urban women, this study provides insights for future interventions aimed at decreasing adiposity in a healthy way."
https://openalex.org/W2769448771,"To determine the relationship between shift work and mental health, particularly insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation, among electronics production workers.A survey was conducted with 14,226 workers from an electronics manufacturer in South Korea. After excluding 112 individuals with incomplete responses, 14,114 respondents were analyzed. As part of a larger project, we collected data on respondents' general characteristics, work-related characteristics, and health status; however, in this study, we focused on the data related to shift work and mental health. Insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation were set as dependent variables and working schedule as set as the independent variable. We performed multiple logistic regression analysis with daytime workers as the reference group. The model was adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, workplace, educational level, and marital status with or without children under 6 years of age.Relative to daytime workers, shift workers had 2.35, 1.23, and 1.17 greater odds of insomnia, depression, and suicidal ideation, respectively. Within the shift worker group, we found that the odds of depression and suicidal ideation increased dramatically when respondents had insomnia. The ORs for depression and suicidal ideation were 4.899 and 7.934, respectively.Our findings suggest that shift work is related to an increased risk of mental health problems in production workers, and the sleep disturbance related with shift work is a central mechanism for this relationship. Since these results suggest that proactive management of sleep problems might attenuate their detrimental effects on shift worker's mental health."
https://openalex.org/W2769467724,"Background Nutrition-sensitive interventions supporting enhanced household food production have potential to improve child dietary quality. However, heterogeneity in market access may cause systematic differences in program effectiveness depending on household wealth and child age. Identifying these effect modifiers can help development agencies specify and target their interventions. Objective This study investigates mediating effects of household wealth and child age on links between farm production and child diets, as measured by production and intake of nutrient-dense food groups. Methods Two rounds (2013 and 2014) of nationally representative survey data (n = 5,978 observations) were used to measure production and children’s dietary intake, as well as a household wealth index and control variables, including breastfeeding. Novel steps used include measuring production diversity in terms of both species grown and food groups grown, as well as testing for mediating effects of family wealth and age of child. Results We find significant associations between child dietary diversity and agricultural diversity in terms of diversity of food groups and of species grown, especially for older children in poorer households, and particularly for fruits and vegetables, dairy and eggs. With each additional food group produced, log-odds of meeting minimum dietary diversity score (≥4) increase by 0.25 (p = 0.01) for children aged 24–59 months. For younger children aged 18–23 months there is a similar effect size but only in the poorest two quintiles of household wealth, and for infants 6–18 months we find no correlation between production and intake in most models. Conclusions Child dietary intake is associated with the composition of farm production, most evident among older preschool children and in poorer households. To improve the nutrition of infants, other interventions are needed; and for relatively wealthier households, own farm production may displace market purchases, which could attenuate the impact of household production on child diets."
https://openalex.org/W2768337705,"This study investigated the effects of a temporally confined naturalistic stressor (academic stress) on immune functions. Furthermore, moderating influences of a number of psychological variables were assessed. Five blood samples were obtained from 20 students during an observation period of 8 weeks, starting 4.5 weeks before an exam period up to 1 week following the last exam. The analysis of 45 immune parameters revealed several time-dependent changes attributable to examination stress. We observed a reduction in the absolute numbers of natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes in peripheral blood and a shift towards more immature and naïve cells within NK and T cell populations. In addition, IL-6 and TNF-α production by LPS-stimulated monocytes was increased. Psychological variables were grouped by means of factor analyses into two factors. One factor, which was interpreted as an indication of chronic stress, moderated the relationships between academic stress and percentages of mature CD57+ NK cells. This chronic stress factor was also associated with an increase in memory and a decrease in naïve CD8 T cells and increased serum levels of IL-17. The present study identifies important potential psychological mediators of stress-induced changes in specific immunological parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2769416308,"Concerns have been raised about the predictive performance (PP) of the EuroSCORE I (ES I) to estimate operative mortality (OM) of patients aged ≥80. The EuroSCORE II (ES II) has been described to have better PP of OM but external validations are scarce. Furthermore, the PP of ES II has not been investigated among the octogenarians. The goal of the study was to compare the PP of ES II and ES I among the overall population and patients ≥ 80.The ES I and ES II were computed for 7161 consecutive patients who underwent major cardiac surgery in a 7-year period. Discrimination was assessed by using the c- index and calibration with the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) and calibration plot by comparing predicted and observed mortality.From the global cohort of 7161 patients, 832 (12%) were ≥80. The mean values of ES I and ES II were 7.4±9.4 and 5.2±9.1 respectively for the whole cohort, 6.3±8.6 and 4.7±8.5 for the patients <80, 15.1±11.8 and 8.5±11.0 for the patients ≥80. The mortality was 9.38% (≥80) versus 5.18% (<80). The discriminatory power was good for the two algorithms among the whole population and the <80 but less satisfying among the ≥80 (AUC 0.64 [0.58-0.71] for ES I and 0.67 [0.60-0.73] for the ES II without significant differences (p = 0.35) between the two scores. For the octogenarians, the ES II had a fair calibration until 10%-predicted values and over-predicted beyond.The ES II has a better PP than the ES I among patients <80. Its discrimination and calibration are less satisfying in patients ≥80, showing an overestimation in the elderly at very high-surgical risk. Nevertheless, it shows an acceptable calibration until 10%- predicted mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2769071052,"Egg quality is a complex biological trait and a major determinant of reproductive fitness in all animals. This study delivered the first proteomic portraits of egg quality in zebrafish, a leading biomedical model for early development. Egg batches of good and poor quality, evidenced by embryo survival for 24 h, were sampled immediately after spawning and used to create pooled or replicated sample sets whose protein extracts were subjected to different levels of fractionation before liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Obtained spectra were searched against a zebrafish proteome database and detected proteins were annotated, categorized and quantified based on normalized spectral counts. Manually curated and automated enrichment analyses revealed poor quality eggs to be deficient of proteins involved in protein synthesis and energy and lipid metabolism, and of some vitellogenin products and lectins, and to have a surfeit of proteins involved in endo-lysosomal activities, autophagy, and apoptosis, and of some oncogene products, lectins and egg envelope proteins. Results of pathway and network analyses suggest that this aberrant proteomic profile results from failure of oocytes giving rise to poor quality eggs to properly transit through final maturation, and implicated Wnt signaling in the etiology of this defect. Quantitative comparisons of abundant proteins in good versus poor quality eggs revealed 17 candidate egg quality markers. Thus, the zebrafish egg proteome is clearly linked to embryo developmental potential, a phenomenon that begs further investigation to elucidate the root causes of poor egg quality, presently a serious and intractable problem in livestock and human reproductive medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2769616806,"Stroke can result in cognitive complaints that can have a large impact on quality of life long after its occurrence. A number of computer-based training programs have been developed with the aim to improve cognitive functioning. Most studies investigating their efficacy used only objective outcome measures, whereas a reduction of subjective cognitive complaints may be equally important for improving quality of life. A few studies used subjective outcome measures but were inconclusive, partly due to methodological shortcomings such as lack of proper active and passive control groups.The aim of the current study was to investigate whether computer-based cognitive flexibility training can improve subjective cognitive functioning and quality of life after stroke.We performed a randomized controlled double blind trial (RCT). Adults (30-80 years old) who had a stroke 3 months to 5 years ago, were randomly assigned to either an intervention group (n = 38), an active control group (i.e., mock training; n = 35), or a waiting list control group (n = 24). The intervention and mock training consisted of 58 half-hour sessions within 12 weeks. The primary subjective outcome measures were cognitive functioning (Cognitive Failure Questionnaire), executive functioning (Dysexecutive Functioning Questionnaire), quality of life (Short Form Health Survey), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL; Lawton & Brody IADL scale), and participation in society (Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation). Secondary subjective outcome measures were recovery after stroke, depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale-depression subscale), fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength-Fatigue subscale), and subjective cognitive improvement (exit list). Finally, a proxy of the participant rated the training effects in subjective cognitive functioning, subjective executive functioning, and IADL.All groups improved on the two measures of subjective cognitive functioning and subjective executive functioning, but not on the other measures. These cognitive and executive improvements remained stable 4 weeks after training completion. However, the intervention group did not improve more than the two control groups. This suggests that improvement was due to training-unspecific effects. The proxies did not report any improvements. We, therefore, conclude that the computer-based cognitive flexibility training did not improve subjective cognitive functioning or quality of life after stroke."

These findings suggest that academia needs to carefully evaluate why these new policies have not been very effective. In this NeuroView, we report on the progress made in higher education, the shortcomings, and how new initiatives hold great promise for improving gender equality in academia around the globe. Gender equality is of the utmost importance for productivity and economic growth (The Global Gender Gap Index, 2015, http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2015/the-case-for-gender-equality/), equal access to healthcare, education, and protecting human rights and freedom. In 2000, UNESCO launched a campaign where countries agreed to “eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005, and achieve gender equality in education by 2015, with a focus on ensuring girls’ full and equal access to and achievement in basic education of good quality” (http://uis.unesco.org/apps/visualisations/women-in-science/#overview!region=40525). Although progress was made, this goal was not achieved as just one in five countries has obtained gender parity, whereby 45% to 55% of researchers are women (Women in science, UIS fact sheet, http://uis.unesco.org/#overview!region=40500). In September 2015, 80 world leaders met at the United Nations to commit to ending discrimination against women by 2030 and announced concrete and measurable actions to kick-start rapid change in their respective countries. Governments were asked to make national commitments to address the challenges that are holding women and girls back from reaching their full potential (http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2015/9/press-release-global-leaders-meeting#sthash.YbWknTXt.dpuff). Although the impact of these policies is too early to assess, it is crucial that we determine where the problems lay to make informed decisions to reduce gender inequality. Significant progress in the political sector has been made in women’s equality in industrialized countries. For example, the number of women in European parliaments has almost doubled in the last 20 years. In Nordic countries, women parliamentarians are 41.7%, whereas they comprise only 25.3% in Europe excluding Nordic countries (http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/leadership-and-political-participation/facts-and-figures) (Table 1).Table 1Percentage of Women in Government and Scientific ResearchCountryParliamentResearcherProfessorProfessor in MSHead of UniversityGender Pay GapcOnly for scientific research and development services statisticsUK32aHouse of Commons37.82223.215bObtained from Times Higher Education24.8DE3726.817.311.516.819.3FR2625.619.3DU13.415.6CH3232.419.319.78.319.4SE4437.223.828.15020.1NL3724.116.216.421.425.1FL4232.226.630.44018.7IT3135.521.113.67.47.4EU243320.923.31517.9DU, data unavailable.

The biggest and most prominent problem in academia is the large number of women that leave their scientific career at early stages. There are striking imbalances between the numbers of women and men at the highest levels of academia. For the whole of the European Commission (EC), 20.9% of full professorships are held by women (European Commission, 2013, https://ec.europa.eu/research/swafs/pdf/pub_gender_equality/she_figures_2015-final.pdf) (Table 1). However, the percentage of female professors varies between countries (30.4% in Finland to 16.4% in the Netherlands). The number of female heads of higher education institutions rose over the last few years but it is still only 15%. Interestingly, an even lower percentage (5.2%) of leadership positions is held by women at S&P 500 companies (http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/women-ceos-sp-500). Other highly qualified professions outside of academic research do not exhibit such large shifts in participation (European Commission, 2009, http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/archives/ebs/ebs_326_sum_en.pdf), as well as the near equal percentage of women in scientific fields at the undergraduate level (Figure 1). Numerous surveys point to the transition between postdoctoral researcher and group leader as the stage of critical loss, though clearly there are many leaks in the pipeline. More shocking has been the finding that only 30% of women with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) qualifications have jobs in a related area (https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/growth/articles/technology-career-pathways-gender-pay-gap.html). Thus, a significant number of women go on to take jobs in non-related roles, representing a loss of both talent and potential economic and scientific gains. To implement proper strategies/policies to ameliorate this loss of talent, we need to understand why women leave the work force. In this NeuroView, we will discuss these issues and propose potential solutions. Gender inequality is evident at different stages in the career of women. Although the same number of boys and girls take STEM subjects at the lower high school (for example, GCSE levels in the UK), fewer girls continue with their STEM subjects in the last 2 years of high school (for example, A levels in the UK), with 40% more boys taking STEM subjects (Deloitte accounting firm data, 2016, https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/growth/articles/technology-career-pathways-gender-pay-gap.html). This poses the question as to why fewer girls choose to take these subjects. Despite this early difference, the number of female undergraduate and PhD students in the life sciences is similar to male students in many European countries (Figure 1). While more women are enrolling in university, particularly in scientific majors, relatively few pursue careers in research. A recent document “The She Figures” produced in close collaboration between the European Commission, Eurostat, the Helsinki Group on Gender in Research and Innovation and Statistical Correspondent (https://data.europa.eu/euodp/data/dataset/she-figures-2015-gender-in-research-and-innovation) shows that overall European women are excelling in higher education, and yet, women represent only a third of researchers and around a fifth of grade A top-level academics (full professors, rectors, etc.). Data and sources for Australia, Canada, Europe, India, Japan, and the United States released by Catalyst, a nonprofit organization with a mission to accelerate progress for women through workplace inclusion (http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/women-academia), show that although women in USA held nearly half (48.4%) of all tenure-track positions in 2013, they held just 37.5% of tenured positions. The European figures are different; women account for 40.1% of academic positions but only 20.9% of tenured positions. Importantly, a significant drop in the number of female principal investigators (PIs) is observed (Figure 1), though the underlying causes are multifaceted and complex. For example, different STEM subfields appear to have leaks at varying points in the pipeline. Engineering and physics fields report low female involvement at the entry-level recruitment stages, while other specialties, such as chemistry and life sciences, report low female retention. At the University College of London (UCL) and at the Swiss University of Lausanne (UNIL), the ratio of PIs is 25% female and 75% male, while the ratio of postdoctoral researchers is equal (Athena SWAN application, UCL, L’égalité en chiffres UNIL, 2015, https://www.unil.ch/egalite/files/live/sites/egalite/files/pdf/2.%20Monitoring_WEB_20170902.pdf) (compare to Figure 1). Analyses of the female candidates applying for independent positions suggest that this is not due to discrimination against women, but rather to the fact that fewer women apply for jobs as independent investigators. Importantly, UNIL identified that once a female applicant enters the recruitment process, she has an equal chance to be offered the position compared to her male counterparts, suggesting that the gender bias is the result of recruitment failure, rather than institutional biases. This finding poses a real challenge to academic training programs and institutions that wish to promote women’s careers to obtain a gender-balanced workforce and further highlights the transition from postdoctoral researcher to independent group leader as a major leak in the pipeline. The cause of this recruitment deficit, however, is not straightforward and does not necessarily explain the low proportion of female PIs in other institutions or scientific subfields. For instance, surveys of chemistry majors have identified dropout rates earlier in the career path, even as soon as the third year of the doctorate degree (UK Resource center for Women in SET, http://www.biochemistry.org/Portals/0/SciencePolicy/Docs/Chemistry%20Report%20For%20Web.pdf). The percentage of female doctoral students who reported planning for a research career was 72% in the first year of the program but fell to just 37% by the third year of study. This is in stark contrast to their male peers, who only showed a 2% change in interest between the same time period (61% planned a research career in the first year versus 59% in the third year). What might drive these dropout rates? Recent surveys found that 67% of Europeans felt that women did not possess the necessary capabilities to succeed in scientific positions (L’Oreal Change the Numbers, September 17, 2015, http://www.loreal.com/media/press-releases/2015/sep/the-loreal-foundation-unveils-the-results-of-its-exclusive-international-study), highlighting the persistence of a serious cultural prejudice that might influence the number of women who make it to the application stage. Surveys of chemistry students in the UK found that doctoral students indicated concerns about the demanding schedule but also had been warned of the future difficulties they would face because of their gender (UK Resource center for Women in SET, http://www.biochemistry.org/Portals/0/SciencePolicy/Docs/Chemistry%20Report%20For%20Web.pdf). These examples, as well as the overall EU data, suggest that solutions to promote women’s careers might need to be tailored to the particular situation, after a thorough analysis of where women are under-represented: be it in the application pool, in the fraction interviewed or hired, or in the retention pool. There is no single answer to why fewer women move from a postdoctoral position to an independent investigator. However, this period coincides with the time when women are likely to start a family, raising several questions. Are family issues the main cause of this gap because women seek a more balanced work-life style? Do women perceive that having a family is an obstacle for pursuing an academic career when men don’t? Interestingly, surveys of postdoctoral researchers funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported several different factors in their decisions to pursue a PI position that exhibited a significant gender bias, including the desire to have and spend time with children, the consideration for their spouse’s career, the need to publish, and the demanding PI schedule. Indeed, the presence of a family appears to impact scientific careers. Among tenured faculty, only 44% of women were married with children, compared to 70% of men. In addition to children, women also take the career interests of their spouses into consideration more often than their male peers, with 31% of married women indicating a willingness to accommodate their husband’s job (versus 21% of married men). Studies have identified a marriage and child premium for men, where publication rates and salaries are increased when male scientists have families. Conversely, female scientists in several STEM fields appear to pay a family penalty (Ceci et al., 2014Ceci S.J. Ginther D.K. Kahn S. Williams W.M. Psychol. Sci. Public Interest. 2014; 15: 75-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These penalties, while startling, might not be surprising as recent surveys found that women express more concern for potential conflicts between academia and family compared to men (50% more female versus male postdoctoral researchers, and four times as many female graduate students) and that this greatly influences their later career and family decisions (Ecklund and Lincoln, 2011Ecklund E.H. Lincoln A.E. PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e22590Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Despite the progressive gender equality policies in Nordic countries, the number of female academics is not that dissimilar to the rest of Europe. Statistical comparison between countries with a strong family support system, such as Sweden and Norway, and those less supportive of families, like the U.S., Italy, and Spain, suggests that family support policies have not improved the number of women in science. In Sweden, for example, only 23.8% of professors are women even though the number of bachelor and graduate students is around 55%–59%, with 45% obtaining a PhD degree. The lack of improvement following implementation of such family support policies could reflect unforeseen gaps (family policies targeted to the wrong career stage) or inadvertent issues stemming from the support itself. Thus, policies surrounding family support need to be reassessed for effectiveness at the early career stages. We are all influenced by our background, cultural environment, and personal experiences (ECU: 2013 Unconscious bias in higher education, https://www.ecu.ac.uk/publications/unconscious-bias-in-higher-education/) and these factors determine our unconscious bias. Unconscious bias refers to a bias that we are unaware of, and which happens outside of our control. It is a bias that happens automatically and is triggered by our brain making quick judgments and assessments of people and situations reflecting the influences of our background, cultural environment, and personal experiences (as for ECU: 2013 Unconscious bias in higher education). Unconscious bias has a profound impact on our decision making and our perception of people. Indeed, a study showed that gender stereotypes about intellectual ability are evident in young children from the age of 6 (Bian et al., 2017Bian L. Leslie S.-J. Cimpian A. Science. 2017; 355: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Conscious and unconscious bias is observed at different levels. This is particularly evident in the aforementioned European population’s self-reported perception of women lacking sufficient capabilities to succeed in science (L’Oreal Change the Numbers, September 17, 2015, http://www.loreal.com/media/press-releases/2015/sep/the-loreal-foundation-unveils-the-results-of-its-exclusive-international-study). Studies also show that both men and women give higher scores to male than female candidates when evaluating very similar CVs. Additionally, letters of recommendations for women are shorter than for men. Gender bias is also observed in the use of words describing candidates in reference letters. While men are described as intelligent, creative, outstanding, assertive, decisive, or passionate, women are described as nice, organized, helpful, and diligent (van der Lee and Ellemers, 2015van der Lee R. Ellemers N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 12349-12353Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). There is also evidence of gendered language in the instructions to applicants, panel members, and reviewers. For example, gender-exclusive (e.g., he) was more often used that gender-inclusive language (e.g., he/she or they). Fewer women are invited to give talks, to participate in committees or panels with executive powers, and are member of reviewing panels (74% male and 26% female) (MRC data from 2014 and Wellcome Trust report 2000). The biggest problem is that when bias is noticed, people tend to ignore it or not to report it, thus contributing to further gender inequality. The creation of databases to record the speaker composition of scientific conferences, such as the BiasWatchNeuro (https://biaswatchneuro.com/about/), could raise awareness of any gender bias in the selection of conference speakers, so that these disparities can be addressed. Several European institutions have implemented policies to increase awareness of unconscious bias and to address how to tackle this problem. In the UK, many universities have introduced unconscious bias courses for faculty members. However, the attendance to these courses is patchy and is not yet a requirement for those who serve on board or reviewing panels. Given that both men and women are biased against women, there is a real need to increase awareness such that each individual should evaluate his/her bias and correct their conduct accordingly. The introduction of unconscious gender bias courses should be implemented from the early stages of the scientific career to eradicate this serious problem. The gender pay gap varies between European countries with an average of 17.9% in favor of men overall. Surprisingly, in countries where gender equality policies have been implemented for more than a decade (Sweden, Norway, and Finland), there is still a significant gender pay gap (Table 1). In the UK, significant progress has been made in narrowing the gender pay gap since the introduction of the Equal Pay Act in 1970. However, around 154 Higher Education Institutes (HEIs) pay less to women than men, whereas only 8 institutions pay men and women equally. On average, women are paid 11.3% less than men in UK academia (ranging from 19.3% to 8%) and overall, the UK ranks 18th on gender parity according to the World Economic Forum (2015). One of the biggest impediments in narrowing the gender pay gap is the lack of transparency on the salary of women and men in academia. In the commercial sector, increasing numbers of companies are beginning to publically report gender pay gap. As of April 2017, private companies with more than 250 employees are beginning to publicly report gender pay gap (https://www.ashurst.com/en/news-and-insights/legal-updates/reporting-on-the-gender-pay-gap/). However, in Europe, not all universities publish the salary of their faculty members. This lack of transparency jeopardizes the empowerment of women and their ability to request pay raises or promotions. Public universities in the United States, for example, publish the salary of faculty members (e.g., University of California: ucpay.globl.org), reinforcing the concept that there is no longer any valid argument to maintain secrecy on salary. Thus, transparency is crucial to achieve a more gender-balanced workforce. Academic institutions play a critical role in the career of young scientists. They are instrumental in the implementation of mentoring programs for students, postdocs, and early career research fellows and they also hire and promote young as well as established investigators. There has been a long-held view that academic institutions might discriminate against women. Although conscious and unconscious bias might contribute to discrimination, data from different countries revealed sharp differences. Italian universities, for example, suffer from such discrimination in line with the data contained in the She Figures 2015 (https://data.europa.eu/euodp/data/dataset/she-figures-2015-gender-in-research-and-innovation). However, in the past 10 years an increasing number of women undertaking an academic career has been observed. In 2015 the number of women with a university degree (Laurea) has reached 58.5% of the total population obtaining a degree. The percentage of women who enrolled in a PhD or specialization program is around 50%. Unfortunately, the passage from the training to the academic career signals a bottleneck with a major inversion of the gender, as positions of women at the top levels are low. In Italy, 35.5% of women are researchers but just 21% are full professors. In the EU, 33% of researchers and 20.9% of professors are women (Table 1). Thus, women fail to achieve the higher ranks of academia compared to their male counterparts in many EU countries. While part of the reason for this phenomenon could be due to fewer women putting themselves forward, many European countries do not have any gender equality policies to ensure that the recruitment and promotion is unbiased. Inequality at academic institutions is also evident in the difference in the support level received by female compared to male independent investigators. According to a recent U.S. report, a significant difference in the amount of start-up funds was observed between recently appointed male and female faculty members, with men obtaining a median of $889,000 against a median of $350,000 for women (Sege et al., 2015Sege R. Nykiel-Bub L. Selk S. JAMA. 2015; 314: 1175-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This inequality could be ameliorated or abolished if salaries and research support were made publicly available. Interestingly, a number of scientists within some fields have taken matters into their own hands and created online databases where recently hired PIs can post their offers and negotiations for others to see. For example, the ecology and evolution field has a database where people post new jobs and salary figures and sometimes negotiation processes (whether there was a spousal hire or not, additional start-up funding, delayed start date, reduced teaching load, etc.). Resources such as this can not only offer transparency, but also might provide valuable insight into the hiring/negotiation process for both female and male researchers in the early stages of their careers. Academic institutions are implementing new initiatives to ameliorate these gender inequalities. The “Bureau de l’Égalité” at UNIL (Switzerland) has the mission to promote gender equality at all academic levels supporting female scientists and families with specific programs (https://www.unil.ch/egalite/fr/home/menuinst/acteurs-et-actrices/bureau-de-legalite/lequipe.html). KU Leuven (Belgium) has recently launched a gender action plan aimed at improving the hiring and advancement of women in the Senior Academic Staff (https://www.kuleuven.be/english/news/2014/ku-leuven-pushes-for-more-female-professors). In 2012, only 13% of full professors were women. The plan stipulates the creation of a central solidarity fund to cover extra costs such as extended due to leaves of absence or pregnancy. Absence due to illness, maternity leave, or paternity leave will now be taken into consideration when calculating an employee’s total research time. This new policy is welcome and should be implemented widely. In Germany, the government has allocated €150 million to equal-opportunity programs in academia to create 200 additional posts for the hiring of highly qualified female academics. The program is making an impact in the number of female academics (http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/sexism-in-germany-universities-rewarded-for-hiring-women-professors-a-576238.html). In Switzerland, the Swiss National Science Foundation had a funding program (Marie Heim-Vogtlin Initiative: http://www.snf.ch/en/funding/careers/mhv-grants/Pages/default.aspx) targeted toward retaining women in science following a career break due to family obligations. This program specifically recruited early-stage researchers to receive funding for a 2–3 year project at a host institution that commits to retain them afterward. As of 2017, this program has unfortunately been discontinued and partially replaced by a different initiative called PRIMA, see later. In England, the Daphne Jackson Trust also provides support for women and men to return to research in STEM after a career break (http://www.daphnejackson.org/). Such programs should be implemented more widely as they can particularly provide an incentive and career boost to young female researchers who might find it difficult to return to work following an extended period of leave. While mobility and family factors play a role in the transition from postdoctoral researcher to faculty member, there appears to be another dynamic at play when it comes to advancement beyond the assistant professor level. Women tend to spend more time at the assistant professor rank than their male peers (National Research Council, 2010, http://spot.colorado.edu/∼tooley/Gender%20Differences%20at%20Critical%20Transitions%20in%20the%20Careers%20of%20Science,%20Engineering,%20and%20Mathematics%20Faculty.pdf), and studies found a stagnation in advancement that could not be explained by the presence of children, spouse, or mobility (Wolfinger et al., 2008Wolfinger N.H. Mason M.A. Goulden M. J. Higher Educ. 2008; 79: 388-405Crossref Google Scholar). Are women less likely to advance in their career trajectory due to institutional biases? Or does this stem more from a lack of self-confidence and unwillingness to put themselves forward for promotion? In the case of the latter possibility, a number of academic institutions have implemented new strategies to identify women who deserve to be promoted and invite them to apply for promotion. However, these policies have only been introduced recently and therefore it is not possible to evaluate their impact yet. This type of policy should be implemented across institutions. There is a clear gender disparity in the number of publications between women and men. For every article with a female as a first author, there is almost twice the number of articles with a male first author (Larivière et al., 2013Larivière V. Ni C. Gingras Y. Cronin B. Sugimoto C.R. Nature. 2013; 504: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Moreover, when a woman appears in a prominent author position (first or last author), this paper attracts fewer citations than when a man was in the same position (Larivière et al., 2013Larivière V. Ni C. Gingras Y. Cronin B. Sugimoto C.R. Nature. 2013; 504: 211-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Scientific journals are beginning to recognize that gender equality is crucial for the progress of science and for the economy. Several journals have evaluated whether there is a gender bias on scientific boards and reviewers and whether gender of the first or last author has an impact of the acceptance rate of scientific papers. Although the data are patchy, some studies are beginning to reveal important biases. In 2012, Nature reported that only 14% of its reviewers and 19% of invited comments and World View were by female scientists. Since then Nature has pledged to tackle this bias (Editorial, 2012Editorial N. Nature. 2012; 491: 495Google Scholar). Science has also conducted a report on gender issues (Berg, 2017Berg J. Science. 2017; 355: 329Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Elsevier has recently published a report on research performance from a gender perspective at the global level, revealing important behavioral differences based on gender (https://www.elsevier.com/research-intelligence/campaigns/gender-17). This is clearly a step forward. However, a number of questions have not been addressed. For example, what is the proportion of female senior authors that submit a paper in comparison with senior male authors? Do papers submitted by female leading authors have the same success rate as those from male authors? Are there differences in the number of revisions requested to papers from senior female authors? Importantly, this and similar data should be made available by journals to assess the overall trend and evaluate the necessary next steps for action."
https://openalex.org/W2768966482,"Drawing on a long history in macroecology, correlation analysis of microbiome datasets is becoming a common practice for identifying relationships or shared ecological niches among bacterial taxa. However, many of the statistical issues that plague such analyses in macroscale communities remain unresolved for microbial communities. Here, we discuss problems in the analysis of microbial species correlations based on presence-absence data. We focus on presence-absence data because this information is more readily obtainable from sequencing studies, especially for whole-genome sequencing, where abundance estimation is still in its infancy. First, we show how Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) and Jaccard's index (J)-two of the most common metrics for correlation analysis of presence-absence data-can contradict each other when applied to a typical microbiome dataset. In our dataset, for example, 14% of species-pairs predicted to be significantly correlated by r were not predicted to be significantly correlated using J, while 37.4% of species-pairs predicted to be significantly correlated by J were not predicted to be significantly correlated using r. Mismatch was particularly common among species-pairs with at least one rare species (<10% prevalence), explaining why r and J might differ more strongly in microbiome datasets, where there are large numbers of rare taxa. Indeed 74% of all species-pairs in our study had at least one rare species. Next, we show how Pearson's correlation coefficient can result in artificial inflation of positive taxon relationships and how this is a particular problem for microbiome studies. We then illustrate how Jaccard's index of similarity (J) can yield improvements over Pearson's correlation coefficient. However, the standard null model for Jaccard's index is flawed, and thus introduces its own set of spurious conclusions. We thus identify a better null model based on a hypergeometric distribution, which appropriately corrects for species prevalence. This model is available from recent statistics literature, and can be used for evaluating the significance of any value of an empirically observed Jaccard's index. The resulting simple, yet effective method for handling correlation analysis of microbial presence-absence datasets provides a robust means of testing and finding relationships and/or shared environmental responses among microbial taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2770480269,"The increased atmospheric temperatures resulting from the increased concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) have had a profound influence on global rice production. China serves as an important area for producing and consuming rice. Therefore, exploring the effects of the simultaneously rising levels of atmospheric CO2 and temperatures on rice growth and quality in the future is very important. The present study was designed to measure the most important aspects of variation for rice-related physiological, ecological and quality indices in different growing periods under a simultaneous increase of CO2 and temperature, through simulation experiments in climate-controlled growth chambers, with southern rice as the study object. The results indicated that the ecological indices, rice phenology, and leaf area would decrease under a simultaneous increase of CO2 and temperature. For the physiological indices, Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels increased significantly in the seedling period. However, it showed the trend of increase and subsequent decrease in the heading and filling periods. In addition, the decomposition of soluble protein (SP) and soluble sugar (SS) accelerated in filling period. The rice quality index of the Head Rice Rate showed the decreasing trend and subsequent increase, but the Chalky Rice Rate and Protein Content indices gradually decreased while the Gel Consistency gradually increased."
https://openalex.org/W2770339859,"A major challenge is to understand maladaptive changes in ion channels that sets neurons on a course towards epilepsy development. Voltage- and calcium-activated K+ (BK) channels contribute to early spike timing in neurons, and studies indicate that the BK channel plays a pathological role in increasing excitability early after a seizure. Here, we have investigated changes in BK channels and their accessory β4 subunit (KCNMB4) in dentate gyrus (DG) granule neurons of the hippocampus, key neurons that regulate excitability of the hippocampus circuit. Two days after pilocarpine-induced seizures, we found that the predominant effect is a downregulation of the β4 accessory subunit mRNA. Consistent with reduced expression, single channel recording and pharmacology indicate a switch in the subtype of channels expressed; from iberiotoxin-resistant, type II BK channels (BK α/β4) that have higher channel open probability and slow gating, to iberiotoxin-sensitive type I channels (BK α alone) with low open probability and faster gating. The switch to a majority of type I channel expression following seizure activity is correlated with a loss of BK channel function on spike threshold while maintaining the channel's contribution to increased early spike frequency. Using heterozygous β4 knockout mice, we find reduced expression is sufficient to increase seizure sensitivity. We conclude that seizure-induced downregulation of KCNMB4 is an activity dependent mechanism that increases the excitability of DG neurons. These novel findings indicate that BK channel subtypes are not only defined by cell-specific expression, but can also be plastic depending on the recent history of neuronal excitability."

Materials and methods The dataset was part of a nationwide cross-sectional survey for evaluating PHC teams conducted by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Patients from each of 16,202 oral health teams were interviewed. In addition to sociodemographic information, the questionnaire included information about patient experience domains: access and booking of dental appointments, bonding and accountability, welcoming of the patient, and their perception of dental facilities. Statistical analysis The dependent variable was the answer to the question ‘From 0 to 10, how would you grade your satisfaction with treatment received from the dentist?’ Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate the unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios and corresponding 95% confidence interval. Results The mean patient satisfaction was 9.4 (±2.3). Higher patient satisfaction with PHC was associated with lower education and the patient’s perception of the clinic conditions. Moreover, higher satisfaction was associated with positive reception and hospitality, enough time for treatment, and instructions that met patients’ needs. Lower satisfaction with PHC was associated with patients who have jobs compared to those who do not work. Conclusion Patient satisfaction is increased with friendly and understanding PHC staff. Moreover, meeting patient expectations by taking time to understand the needs and giving the right instructions is associated with higher satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2769425197,"Epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in the regulation of tumorigenesis, and hypoxia-induced epigenetic changes may be critical for the adaptation of cancer cells to the hypoxic microenvironment of solid tumors. Previously, we showed that loss-of-function of the hypoxia-regulated H3K9 methyltransferase G9A attenuates tumor growth. However, the mechanisms by which blockade of G9A leads to a tumor suppressive effect remain poorly understood. We show that G9A is highly expressed in breast cancer and is associated with poor patient prognosis, where it may function as a potent oncogenic driver. In agreement with this, G9A inhibition by the small molecule inhibitor, BIX-01294, leads to increased cell death and impaired cell migration, cell cycle and anchorage-independent growth. Interestingly, whole transcriptome analysis revealed that genes involved in diverse cancer cell functions become hypoxia-responsive upon G9A inhibition. This was accompanied by the upregulation of the hypoxia inducible factors HIF1α and HIF2α during BIX-01294 treatment even in normoxia that may facilitate the tumor suppressive effects of BIX-01294. HIF inhibition was able to reverse some of the transcriptional changes induced by BIX-01294 in hypoxia, indicating that the HIFs may be important drivers of these derepressed target genes. Therefore, we show that G9A is a key mediator of oncogenic processes in breast cancer cells and G9A inhibition by BIX-01294 can successfully attenuate oncogenicity even in hypoxia."
https://openalex.org/W2769893273,"Fresh-cut luffa (Luffa cylindrica) fruits commonly undergo browning. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms regulating this process. We used the RNA-seq technique to analyze the transcriptomic changes occurring during the browning of fresh-cut fruits from luffa cultivar ‘Fusi-3’. Over 90 million high-quality reads were assembled into 58,073 Unigenes, and 60.86% of these were annotated based on sequences in four public databases. We detected 35,282 Unigenes with significant hits to sequences in the NCBInr database, and 24,427 Unigenes encoded proteins with sequences that were similar to those of known proteins in the Swiss-Prot database. Additionally, 20,546 and 13,021 Unigenes were similar to existing sequences in the Eukaryotic Orthologous Groups of proteins and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases, respectively. Furthermore, 27,301 Unigenes were differentially expressed during the browning of fresh-cut luffa fruits (i.e., after 1–6 h). Moreover, 11 genes from five gene families (i.e., PPO, PAL, POD, CAT, and SOD) identified as potentially associated with enzymatic browning as well as four WRKY transcription factors were observed to be differentially regulated in fresh-cut luffa fruits. With the assistance of rapid amplification of cDNA ends technology, we obtained the full-length sequences of the 15 Unigenes. We also confirmed these Unigenes were expressed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. This study provides a comprehensive transcriptome sequence resource, and may facilitate further studies aimed at identifying genes affecting luffa fruit browning for the exploitation of the underlying mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2770280349,"Most research on working memory (WM) training for children with developmental dyslexia (DD) has focused on western alphabetical languages. Moreover, most of these studies used a combination of training tasks targeting a variety of WM components, making it difficult to determine whether WM training generates a general improvement in overall reading, or improves specific cognitive skills corresponding to the WM components that are targeted in training. We tested the general and specific effects of WM training on the reading skills of 45 Chinese children with DD, grades 3 to 5. In Experiment 1, the experimental group received a program targeting the verbal WM component; in Experiment 2, the experimental group was trained with a program targeting visuospatial WM. In both experiments the control group played a placebo video game. In Experiment 1, the experimental group outperformed the control group on the visual rhyming task, which is highly correlated with verbal WM. In Experiment 2, the experimental group outperformed the control group on the orthographic awareness test, which is highly correlated with visuospatial WM. Furthermore, in both Experiment 1 and Experiment 2, the experimental groups outperformed the control groups on the fast word naming test, which is highly related to both visuospatial WM and verbal WM. Results indicated that WM training improved specific reading-related cognitive skills that are highly correlated with the specific WM components that were the target of training."
https://openalex.org/W2768716469,"Objectives Bipolar disorder (BD) carries the greatest risk of death by suicide of all psychiatric conditions as 25%–50% of those with BD will make one or more suicide attempt, and about 15% will intentionally end their lives. Among young adults with BD, substance misuse, medication non-adherence, age at onset, and comorbid psychiatric conditions each predict self-harm. It is currently unclear if these same factors or others predict suicide ideation among older adults with BD. Methods We recruited a global sample of 220 older adults with BD over 19 days using socio-demographically targeted, social media advertising and online data collection (Mean = 58.50, SD = 5.42; range 50 to 81 years). Path analyses allowed us to identify direct and indirect predictors of suicide ideation among older adults with BD. Results Cognitive failures (perception, memory, and motor function), depressive symptoms, alcohol misuse, and dissatisfaction with life as direct predictors of suicide ideation; duration of BD symptoms and medication non-adherence emerged as indirect predictors. Of note, the significant impact of sleep on suicide ideation is indirect via depressive symptoms, cognitive failures, medication non-adherence and life dissatisfaction. Conclusions As with young adults with BD, alcohol misuse and medication non-adherence emerged as significant predictors of suicide ideation. In addition, cognitive failures directly and indirectly predict suicide ideation in this sample of older adults with BD. Population aging and treatment efficacy are leading to ever growing numbers of older adults with BD. Both direct and indirect predictors of suicide ideation need to be considered in future BD research and treatment planning."
https://openalex.org/W2768846658,"Cervical cancer (CC) is the most common type of cancer in women and is the third leading cause of death in most developing countries, causing more than 288,000 deaths in women worldwide each year. The most favourable survival rate is in developed countries, since CC mortality has recently declined in those countries. The purpose of this study was to determine the survival rate and associated factors of CC patients at a reference hospital in the Amazon region. The patient sample included records of 339 patients with cervical cancer who had been hospitalized in Belém, Pará, Brazil from January 2005 to December 2010; the socioeconomic and clinical data were collected between June and September 2016. A survival rate of approximately 84% was observed, and it was found that disease stage (p <0.01), metastasis (p <0.01) and readmission (p <0.01) had significant influences on patient outcome. The impact of these factors on the general survival rate was higher in the Amazon region compared with other regions of Brazil, and the primary survival factors were associated with earlier stages of the disease. However, more national studies are needed on this subject. Our findings may contribute to the development of regional strategies for the prevention of cervical cancer, a reduction in its incidence and mortality rate, an increase in survival time and an improvement in the quality of life of these women."
https://openalex.org/W2770227967,"Maternal influenza infection during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality. However, the link between the anti-influenza immune responses and health-related risks during infection is not well understood. We have analyzed memory T and NK cell mediated immunity (CMI) responses in pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (pdm09) virus infected non-vaccinated pregnant women participating in the Norwegian Influenza Pregnancy Cohort (NorFlu). The cohort includes information on immunization, self-reported health and disease status, and biological samples (plasma and PBMC). Infected cases (N = 75) were defined by having a serum hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer > = 20 to influenza pdm09 virus at the time of delivery, while controls (N = 75) were randomly selected among non-infected pregnant women (HI titer <10). In ELISpot assays cases had higher frequencies of IFNγ+ CD8+ T cells responding to pdm09 virus or conserved CD8 T cell-restricted influenza A virus epitopes, compared to controls. Within this T cell population, frequencies of CD95+ late effector (CD45RA+CCR7-) and naive (CD45RA+CCR7+) CD8+ memory T cells correlated inversely with self-reported influenza illness (ILI) symptoms. ILI symptoms in infected women were also associated with lower numbers of poly-functional (IFNγ+TNFα+, IL2+IFNγ+, IL2+IFNγ+TNFα+) CD4+ T cells and increased frequencies of IFNγ+CD3-CD7+ NK cells compared to asymptomatic cases, or controls, after stimulation with the pdm09 virus. Taken together, virus specific and functionally distinct T and NK cell populations may serve as cellular immune correlates of clinical outcomes of pandemic influenza disease in pregnant women. Our results may provide information important for future universal influenza vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W2770337410,"“Masked mycotoxins” senso strictu are conjugates of mycotoxins resulting from metabolic pathways activated by the interplay between pathogenic fungi and infected plants. Zearalenone, an estrogenic mycotoxin produced by Fusarium spp, was the first masked mycotoxin ever described in the literature, but its biotransformation has been studied to a lesser extent if compared to other compounds such as deoxynivalenol. We presented herein the first application of organ and tissue culture techniques to study the metabolic fate of zearalenone in durum wheat, using an untargeted HR-LCMS approach. A complete, quick absorption of zearalenone by uninfected plant organs was noticed, and its biotransformation into a large spectrum of phase I and phase II metabolites has been depicted. Therefore, wheat organ tissue cultures can be effectively used as a biocatalytic tool for the production of masked mycotoxins, as well as a replicable model for the investigation of the interplay between mycotoxins and wheat physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2768584783,"Music sometimes improves performance in sustained attention tasks. But the type of music employed in previous investigations has varied considerably, which can account for equivocal results. Progress has been hampered by lack of a systematic database of music varying in key characteristics like tempo and valence. The aims of this study were to establish a database of popular music varying along the dimensions of tempo and valence and to examine the impact of music varying along these dimensions on restoring attentional resources following performance of a sustained attention to response task (SART) vigil. Sixty-nine participants rated popular musical selections that varied in valence and tempo to establish a database of four musical types: fast tempo positive valence, fast tempo negative valence, slow tempo positive valence, and slow tempo negative valence. A second group of 89 participants performed two blocks of the SART task interspersed with either no break or a rest break consisting of 1 of the 4 types of music or silence. Presenting positive valence music (particularly of slow tempo) during an intermission between two successive blocks of the SART significantly decreased miss rates relative to negative valence music or silence. Results support an attentional restoration theory of the impact of music on sustained attention, rather than arousal theory and demonstrate a means of restoring sustained attention. Further, the results establish the validity of a music database that will facilitate further investigations of the impact of music on performance."
https://openalex.org/W2770094938,"Background Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a major challenge in liver transplantation. The mitochondrial pathway plays a pivotal role in hepatic IRI. Levosimendan, a calcium channel sensitizer, was shown to attenuate apoptosis after IRI in animal livers. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of levosimendan on apoptosis in human hepatocytes. Methods Primary human hepatocytes were either exposed to hypoxia or cultured under normoxic conditions. After the hypoxic phase, reoxygenation was implemented and cells were treated with different concentrations of levosimendan (10ng/ml, 100ng/ml, 1000ng/ml). The overall metabolic activity of the cells was measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were determined in order to quantify hepatic injury. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was applied to measure necrosis and apoptosis. Finally, Western blotting was performed to analyze apoptotic pathway proteins. Results Administration of levosimendan during reperfusion increases the metabolic activity of human hepatocytes and decreases AST levels. Moreover, apoptosis after IRI is reduced in treated vs. untreated hepatocytes, and levosimendan prevents down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 as well as up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX. Conclusion The present study suggests a protective effect of levosimendan on human hepatocytes. Our findings suggest that treatment with levosimendan during reperfusion attenuates apoptosis of human hepatocytes by influencing BAX and Bcl-2 levels."
https://openalex.org/W2769952990,"To evaluate whether periodontitis modulates lung inflammation in an experimental model of asthma as well as the photodynamic therapy (PDT) is associated with a reduction of lung inflammation. Seventy-two BALB/c male mice (~2 months) were randomly divided into 8 groups (n = 9): Basal, Periodontitis (P), P+PT, P+PT+PDT, Asthma (A), A+P, A+P+PT, and A+P+PT+PDT. Periodontitis was induced by using the ligature technique and asthma was induced by ovalbumin (OVA). PT was performed with curettes and PDT with methylene blue (0.005%), λ = 660nm, with a radiant exposure of 318J/cm2. After 43 days, euthanasia was carried out prior to lung and mandible morphological analyzes. All of the manipulations of the animals were performed by only one operator. The total and differential cell counts and cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were evaluated in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and in the serum. Mucus and alkaline phosphatase were also quantified. Statistical analyzes were performed by a blinded statistician. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. Periodontitis group (P) increased alkaline phosphatase and bone resorption (p<0.05), validating the experimental model of periodontitis. The A group and the P group increased the total amount of cells (p <0.05) in the BAL. However, in the A+P group, there was a decrease in these cells, except for in the A+P+PT+PDT group (p<0.05). The asthma group increased the Th2 cytokines and P group increased the Th1 cytokine profile, and A+P+PT+PDT group increased IL-10 cytokine. Mucus was increased for the A and P groups. In conclusion, periodontitis in the asthmatic mice reduced the inflammatory migrated cells in the BAL (eosinophils, lymphocytes, macrophages). In addition, it reduced the levels of the IL-4 and TNF-α cytokines, which was also accompanied by a decreased mucus production. After PDT treatment the total cell count increased however, this increase was not accompanied by a pro-inflammatory cytokines release. Only in PDT group the anti-inflammatory IL-10 was increased. Further studies are needed to understand this mechanism of action."
https://openalex.org/W2768165659,"Interbody fusion with posterior instrumentation is a common method for treating lumbar degenerative disc diseases. However, the high rigidity of the fusion construct may produce abnormal stresses at the adjacent segment and lead to adjacent segment degeneration (ASD). As such, biodegradable implants are becoming more popular for use in orthopaedic surgery. These implants offer sufficient stability for fusion but at a reduced stiffness. Tailored to degrade over a specific timeframe, biodegradable implants could potentially mitigate the drawbacks of conventional stiff constructs and reduce the loading on adjacent segments. Six finite element models were developed in this study to simulate a spine with and without fixators. The spinal fixators used both titanium rods and biodegradable rods. The models were subjected to axial loading and pure moments. The range of motion (ROM), disc stresses, and contact forces of facet joints at adjacent segments were recorded. A 3-point bending test was performed on the biodegradable rods and a dynamic bending test was performed on the spinal fixators according to ASTM F1717-11a. The finite element simulation showed that lumbar spinal fusion using biodegradable implants had a similar ROM at the fusion level as at adjacent levels. As the rods degraded over time, this produced a decrease in the contact force at adjacent facet joints, less stress in the adjacent disc and greater loading on the anterior bone graft region. The mechanical tests showed the initial average fatigue strength of the biodegradable rods was 145 N, but this decreased to 115N and 55N after 6 months and 12 months of soaking in solution. Also, both the spinal fixator with biodegradable rods and with titanium rods was strong enough to withstand 5,000,000 dynamic compression cycles under a 145 N axial load. The results of this study demonstrated that biodegradable rods may present more favourable clinical outcomes for lumbar fusion. These polymer rods could not only provide sufficient initial stability, but the loss in rigidity of the fixation construct over time gradually transfers loading to adjacent segments."
https://openalex.org/W2769617449,"Hereditary mutations in Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP/uromodulin) gene cause autosomal dominant kidney diseases characterized by juvenile-onset hyperuricemia, gout and progressive kidney failure, although the disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we show that targeted expression in transgenic mice of a mutation within the domain of 8 cysteines of THP in kidneys’ thick ascending limb (TAL) caused unfolded protein response in younger (1-month old) mice and apoptosis in older (12-month old) mice. While the young mice had urine concentration defects and polyuria, such defects progressively reversed in the older mice to marked oliguria, highly concentrated urine, fibrotic kidneys and reduced creatinine clearance. Both the young and the old transgenic mice had significantly higher serum uric acid and its catabolic product, allantoin, than age-matched wild-type mice. This THP mutation apparently caused primary defects in TAL by compromising the luminal translocation and reabsorptive functions of NKCC2 and ROMK and secondary responses in proximal tubules by upregulating NHE3 and URAT1. Our results strongly suggest that the progressive worsening of kidney functions reflects the accumulation of the deleterious effects of the misfolded mutant THP and the compensatory responses. Transgenic mice recapitulating human THP/uromodulin-associated kidney diseases could be used to elucidate their pathogenesis and test novel therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2768183382,"The sugarcane borer or corn stalk borer, Diatraea Guilding is polyphagous insect pest of many important crops such as corn, sorghum and sugarcane. Losses arising from the attack of Diatraea species have been a serious problem, which may cause loss in sugarcane production around 0.25% in sugar, 0.20% in alcohol and 0.77% of body weight for every 1% infestation and up to 21% in corn production fields. In Brazil, the most commonly reported species are Diatraea saccharalis (Fabricius, 1794) and Diatraea impersonatella (Walker, 1863) (= D. flavipennella). However, multiple other species of Diatraea have been identified in Brazil according to the literature. Currently, little information exists on the presence of the other species causing injury to sugarcane and corn. The objectives of this study were to improve the accuracy of species assignment, evaluate the population genetic structure, and address many of the outstanding questions of systematics and evolution of Brazilian populations of D. saccharalis. To address these main questions, classical taxonomic methods were used, focused on morphological characterization of the reproductive organs, especially the male genitalia. In addition, genetic studies were performed using simple sequence repeats (SSR) and a fragment of cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. The data and findings from this research will contribute to the understanding of evolutionary aspects of insect pests in order to develop more effective and sustainable population management practices."
https://openalex.org/W2768910872,"Placental insufficiency alters the intrauterine environment leading to increased risk for chronic disease including impaired glucose metabolism in low birth weight infants. Using a rat model of low birth weight, we previously reported that placental insufficiency induces a significant increase in circulating testosterone in male intrauterine growth-restricted offspring (mIUGR) in early adulthood that is lost by 12 months of age. Numerous studies indicate testosterone has a positive effect on glucose metabolism in men. Female growth-restricted littermates exhibit glucose intolerance at 6 months of age. Thus, the aim of this paper was to determine whether mIUGR develop impaired glucose metabolism, and whether a decrease in elevated testosterone levels plays a role in its onset. Male growth-restricted offspring were studied at 6 and 12 months of age. No impairment in glucose tolerance was observed at 6 months of age when mIUGR exhibited a 2-fold higher testosterone level compared to age-matched control. Fasting blood glucose was significantly higher and glucose tolerance was impaired with a significant decrease in circulating testosterone in mIUGR at 12 compared with 6 months of age. Castration did not additionally impair fasting blood glucose or glucose tolerance in mIUGR at 12 months of age, but fasting blood glucose was significantly elevated in castrated controls. Restoration of elevated testosterone levels significantly reduced fasting blood glucose and improved glucose tolerance in mIUGR. Thus, our findings suggest that the endogenous increase in circulating testosterone in mIUGR is protective against impaired glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2770961916,"Grain shape is a key factor that influences both the appearance quality and grain yield of rice. To clarify the genetic basis of grain shape, an advanced backcross population was developed from the cross of a slender indica variety Jin23B and a round japonica variety QingGuAi, and a total of 10 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain shape were detected over 2 years. Three QTLs, qGW1, qGS3 and qGS7 have large effects on grain shape and were detected in both years. To further validate their effects, the BC4F2 populations of the three QTLs were constructed. The alleles from QingGuAi of qGW1 and qGS7 both greatly increase grain width and the alleles from Jin23B of qGS3 greatly increase grain length. The allele variations of the three QTLs lead to the totally different grain shape of the two rice varieties. Our study provides insights into the genetic bases of grain shape and will promote the improvements of grain quality and yield in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2768460645,"Genetically encoded filamentous actin probes, Lifeact, Utrophin and F-tractin, are used as tools to label the actin cytoskeleton. Recent evidence in several different cell types indicates that these probes can cause changes in filamentous actin dynamics, altering cell morphology and function. Although these probes are commonly used to visualise actin dynamics in neurons, their effects on axonal and dendritic morphology has not been systematically characterised. In this study, we quantitatively analysed the effect of Lifeact, Utrophin and F-tractin on neuronal morphogenesis in primary hippocampal neurons. Our data show that the expression of actin-tracking probes significantly impacts on axonal and dendrite growth these neurons. Lifeact-GFP expression, under the control of a pBABE promoter, caused a significant decrease in total axon length, while another Lifeact-GFP expression, under the control of a CAG promoter, decreased the length and complexity of dendritic trees. Utr261-EGFP resulted in increased dendritic branching but Utr230-EGFP only accumulated in cell soma, without labelling any neurites. Lifeact-7-mEGFP and F-tractin-EGFP in a pEGFP-C1 vector, under the control of a CMV promoter, caused only minor changes in neuronal morphology as detected by Sholl analysis. The results of this study demonstrate the effects that filamentous actin tracking probes can have on the axonal and dendritic compartments of neuronal cells and emphasise the care that must be taken when interpreting data from experiments using these probes."
https://openalex.org/W2770429910,"Everyday, we are bombarded with periodic, exogenous appeals and instructions on how to behave. How do these appeals and instructions affect subsequent coordination? Using experimental methods, we investigate how a one-time exogenous instruction affects subsequent coordination among individuals in a lab. Participants play a minimum effort game repeated 5 times under fixed matching with a one-time behavioral instruction in either the first or second round. Since coordination behavior may vary across countries, we run experiments in Denmark, Spain and Ghana, and map cross-country rankings in coordination with known national measures of fractualization, uncertainty avoidance and long-term orientation. Our results show that exogenous interventions increase subsequent coordination, with earlier interventions yielding better coordination than later interventions. We also find that cross-country rankings in coordination map with published national measures of fractualization, uncertainty avoidance, and long-term orientation."
https://openalex.org/W2768153637,"We investigated the aftereffects of confirmatory QuantiFERON testing (QFT) added to a positive tuberculin skin test (TST). We reviewed the pre and post course of sequential tuberculosis (TB) outbreaks in a high school where massive 43 active TB cases had been found within one year before delayed contact investigation. And we investigated the TB development in relation to initial TST and QFT during mean follow-up of 3.9 ± 0.9 years. After delayed contact investigation for two subsequent TB outbreaks, 925 contacts were divided into the following 3 groups: TST- (n = 632), TST+/QFT+ (n = 24), TST+/QFT- (n = 258). QFT- was more prevalent than QFT+ in contacts with 10mm ≤ TST <15mm (158, 61.2%) compared with TST ≥15mm (100, 38.8%) among the TST+ reactors (P < 0.001). Among the 258 TST+/QFT- subjects, 256 received no latent TB infection (LTBI) treatment, but 7 contacts developed TB during follow-up. Among these 7 patients, 4 had initial TST ≥15mm and 3 had 10mm ≤ TST <15mm. In conclusion, the delayed contact investigation for LTBI in a high school resulted in continued TB developments. False-negative QFT performed late among the TST+ reactors should not be considered criteria for LTBI treatment. Additionally, the contacts only with TST ≥15mm should be considered for LTBI treatment in congregate settings of intermediate-burden countries."
https://openalex.org/W2768677364,"B-1 lymphocytes are known to increase the metastatic potential of B16F10 melanoma cells via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. Since IL-10 is associated with B-1 cells performance, we hypothesized that IL-10 could be implicated in the progression of melanoma. In the present work, we found that the C57BL/6 mice, inoculated with B16F10 cells that were co-cultivated with B-1 lymphocytes from IL-10 knockout mice, developed fewer metastatic nodules than the ones which were injected with the melanoma cells that were cultivated in the presence of wild-type B-1 cells. The impairment of metastatic potential of the B16F10 cells was correlated with low activation of the ERK signaling pathway, supporting the idea that the production of IL-10 by B-1 cells influences the behavior of the tumor. A microarray analysis of the B-1 lymphocytes revealed that IL-10 deficiency is associated with down-regulation of the genes that code for claudin-10, a protein that is involved in cell-to-cell contact and that has been linked to lung adenocarcinoma. In order to determine the impact of claudin-10 in the cross-talk between B-1 lymphocytes and the B16F10 tumor cells, we took advantage of small interfering RNA. The silencing of claudin-10 gene in B-1 lymphocytes inhibited activation of the ERK pathway and abrogated the B-1-induced aggressive behavior of the B16F10 cells. Thus, our findings suggest that the axis IL-10/claudin-10 is a promising target for the development of therapeutic agents against aggressive melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2770073034,"Limited information exists on the anatomically-specific early stage events leading to clinically detectable mineral aggregates in the renal papilla. In this study, quantitative multiscale correlative maps of structural, elemental and biochemical properties of whole medullo-papillary complexes from human kidneys were developed. Correlative maps of properties specific to the uriniferous and vascular tubules using high-resolution X-ray computed tomography, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and immunolocalization of noncollagenous proteins (NCPs) along with their association with anatomy specific biominerals were obtained. Results illustrated that intratubular spherical aggregates primarily form at the proximal regions distant from the papillary tip while interstitial spherical and fibrillar aggregates are distally located near the papillary tip. Biominerals at the papillary tip were closely localized with 10 to 50 μm diameter vasa recta immunolocalized for CD31 inside the medullo-papillary complex. Abundant NCPs known to regulate bone mineralization were localized within nanoparticles, forming early pathologic mineralized regions of the complex. Based on the physical association between vascular and urothelial tubules, results from light and electron microscopy techniques suggested that these NCPs could be delivered from vasculature to prompt calcification of the interstitial regions or they might be synthesized from local vascular smooth muscle cells after transdifferentiation into osteoblast-like phenotypes. In addition, results provided insights into the plausible temporal events that link the anatomically specific intratubular mineral aggregates with the interstitial biomineralization processes within the functional unit of the kidney."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the genetic association of high plasma IP-10 level in the MMT patients. The gene-based and pathway-based association analyses were conducted using a genome-wide association study dataset in 344 MMT patients for identifying genes and pathways associated with plasma IP-10 level. We found that plasma IP-10 level was significantly associated with a pathway in the tight junction (P = 1.01x10-5), where the claudin 8 (CLDN8) gene had the most significant association (P = 6.8x10-5). A functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs686364 at exon 1 of CLDN8 showed strong association with plasma IP-10 levels, in the MMT subjects with positive urine test for morphine (dominant model, P = 0.00004). The minor allele type carriers had higher plasma IP-10 levels than the major allele type carriers. Our data support that the tight junction protein claudin 8 exon 1 is a predictor for the plasma levels of IP-10 in MMT patients with urine test positive for morphine."

Among protein-protein interactions, we previously showed that Annexin A5 (AnxA5) binds to CFTR and is involved in the channel localization within membranes and in its Cl- channel function. The deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del) is the most common mutation in CF which leads to an altered protein (F508del-CFTR) folding with a nascent protein retained within the ER and is quickly degraded. We previously showed that AnxA5 binds to F508del-CFTR and that its increased expression due to a Gonadoliberin (GnRH) augments Cl- efflux in cells expressing F508del-CFTR. The aim of the present work was to use the GnRH analog buserelin which is already used in medicine. Human nasal epithelial cells from controls and CF patients (F508del/F508del) were treated with buserelin and we show here that the treatment alleviates Cl- channel defects in CF cells. Using proteomics we highlighted some proteins explaining this result. Finally, we propose that buserelin is a potential new pharmaceutical compound that can be used in CF and that bronchus can be targeted since we show here that they express GnRH-R."
https://openalex.org/W2769479499,"The shear swirling flow vibration cementing (SSFVC) technique rotates the downhole eccentric cascade by circulating cementing fluid. It makes the casing eccentrically revolve at high speed around the borehole axis. It produces strong agitation action to the annulus fluid, makes it in the state of shear turbulent flow, and results in the formation of pulse pressure which affects the surrounding rock stress. This study was focused on 1) the calculation of the pulse pressure in an annular turbulent flow field based on the finite volume method, and 2) the analysis of the effect of pulse pressure on borehole stability. On the upside, the pulse pressure is conducive to enhancing the liquidity of the annulus fluid, reducing the fluid gel strength, and preventing the formation of fluid from channeling. But greater pulse pressure may cause lost circulation and even formation fracturing. Therefore, in order to ensure smooth cementing during SSFVC, the effect of pulse pressure should be considered when cementing design."
