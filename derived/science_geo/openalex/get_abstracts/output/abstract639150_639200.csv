However, identifying the temporal lineage of cell development can be difficult without large-scale analyses. Packer et al. sequenced more than 80,000 cells from embryos of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans to determine the expression of genes directing the development of terminal cell types. Because all somatic cells in a C. elegans individual have been mapped, the authors are able to connect gene expression with cell lineages over time during development, noting stark transitions in some cases.

Most handheld spectrometers are based on tabletop optical components, which limits the scale to which these spectrometers can be shrunk. To address the desire for miniaturized spectrometers with a micrometer-scale (and smaller) footprint, Yang et al. developed such a microspectrometer based on single, compositionally engineered nanowire. This result is a practical step forward for the use of other light-sensitive nanomaterials for such ultra-miniaturized spectroscopy platforms. Science , this issue p. 1017"

One possible resolution could be that electrons interact with protons in a different way than muons do, which would require “new physics.” Bezginov et al. measured the Lamb shift in electronic hydrogen, which allowed for a direct comparison to the Lamb shift measured in muonic hydrogen. The two results agreed, but the discrepancy with the averaged value remains. Science , this issue p. 1007"
https://openalex.org/W3099391573,"The construction of atomically-precise carbon nanostructures holds promise for developing novel materials for scientific study and nanotechnology applications. Here we show that graphene origami is an efficient way to convert graphene into atomically-precise, complex, and novel nanostructures. By scanning-tunneling-microscope manipulation at low temperature, we repeatedly fold and unfold graphene nanoislands (GNIs) along arbitrarily chosen direction. A bilayer graphene stack featuring a tunable twist angle and a tubular edge connection between the layers are formed. Folding single-crystal GNIs creates tubular edges with specified chirality and one-dimensional electronic features similar to those of carbon nanotubes, while folding bi-crystal GNIs creates well-defined intramolecular junctions. Both origami structural models and electronic band structures were computed to complement analysis of the experimental results. The present atomically-precise graphene origami provides a platform for constructing novel carbon nanostructures with engineered quantum properties and ultimately quantum machines."
https://openalex.org/W2971658418,"Stabilizing synthetic gene circuits Making synthetic gene circuits in bacteria is one thing, but making them stable under selective pressure with high mutation rates is another. Liao et al. addressed this problem with an ecological strategy in which they created three strains of bacteria, each of which could kill or be killed by one of the other strains (see the Perspective by Johnston and Collins). Once the first strain of bacteria hosting the engineered circuit underwent mutations that decreased function, the system could be “rebooted” by addition of another strain that killed the first but also contained the desired synthetic circuit, allowing its function to proceed unperturbed. This strategy provides a way to control synthetic ecosystems and maintain synthetic gene circuits without using traditional selection to maintain plasmids with antibiotics.

Previous structures have revealed the architecture of TRPM8 and how it binds ligands but not its gating mechanism. Diver et al. determined structures of avian TRPM8 in ligand-free, antagonist-bound, and calcium-bound states using cryo–electron microscopy at resolutions between 3.0 and 3.6 angstroms. They observed a closed state in the presence of antagonist and that large conformational changes are required to form the desensitized state in the presence of calcium. Understanding how ligands affect channel gating may facilitate drug design. Science , this issue p. 1434"
https://openalex.org/W2971583326,"A discovery that neutrinos are not the usual Dirac but Majorana fermions, i.e. identical to their antiparticles, would be a manifestation of new physics with profound implications for particle physics and cosmology. Majorana neutrinos would generate neutrinoless double-$\beta$ ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay, a matter-creating process without the balancing emission of antimatter. So far, 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay has eluded detection. The GERDA collaboration searches for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{76}$Ge by operating bare germanium detectors in an active liquid argon shield. With a total exposure of 82.4 kg$\cdot$yr, we observe no signal and derive a lower half-life limit of T$_{1/2}$ > 0.9$\cdot$10$^{26}$ yr (90% C.L.). Our T$_{1/2}$ sensitivity assuming no signal is 1.1$\cdot$10$^{26}$ yr. Combining the latter with those from other $0{\nu}\beta\beta$ decay searches yields a sensitivity to the effective Majorana neutrino mass of 0.07 - 0.16 eV, with corresponding sensitivities to the absolute mass scale in $\beta$ decay of 0.15 - 0.44 eV, and to the cosmological relevant sum of neutrino masses of 0.46 - 1.3 eV."

Shlesinger and Loya alert us to an equally dangerous yet nearly invisible hazard to coral: loss of breeding synchrony (see the Perspective by Fogarty and Marhaver). They found that environmental changes have resulted in shifts in the timing of gamete release in several species of broadcast-spawning corals in the Red Sea. Similar changes are likely occurring globally. Such a loss of spawning synchrony could result in reproductive failure, a much less obvious but no less insidious threat to coral reefs.

https://openalex.org/W3101014799,"An optical contortionist The development of gauge fields is fundamental to our theoretical understanding of interactions in physical systems. There are two kinds of fields: Abelian, in which the measured effects on an observable parameter are commutative; and non-Abelian (noncommutative), where the sequence in which the field is applied matters. The latter are more difficult to realize in solid-state systems, but recent theoretical work has suggested that these could be synthesized optically. Yang et al. generated non-Abelian gauge fields by cascading multiple nonreciprocal optical elements and verified this accomplishment by the observed interference patterns in a Sagnac interferometer. Having a system that is tunable between Abelian and non-Abelian regimes will be important for studying complex topological states in photonic platforms. Science , this issue p. 1021"

Desvignes et al. monitored a pulsar for more than a decade, observing how its radio pulses vary. General relativity causes precession of the rotation axis, because of the influence of a binary companion. In 2005, two pulses per rotation were visible, one from each magnetic pole, but by 2018 one had precessed out of our line of sight and disappeared. Mapping the radio emission across the magnetic pole determines the beaming angle, the angular region in which a radio observer can detect a pulsar. Science , this issue p. 1013"
https://openalex.org/W2971441893,"Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) is one of the major cancers worldwide, responsible for millions of premature deaths every year. Prediction of clinical staging is vital to implement optimal therapeutic strategy and prognostic prediction in cancer patients. However, to date, no method has been developed for predicting the stage of LIHC from the genomic profile of samples.The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of 173 early stage (stage-I), 177 late stage (stage-II, Stage-III and stage-IV) and 50 adjacent normal tissue samples for 60,483 RNA transcripts and 485,577 methylation CpG sites, was extensively analyzed to identify the key transcriptomic expression and methylation-based features using different feature selection techniques. Further, different classification models were developed based on selected key features to categorize different classes of samples implementing different machine learning algorithms.In the current study, in silico models have been developed for classifying LIHC patients in the early vs. late stage and cancerous vs. normal samples using RNA expression and DNA methylation data. TCGA datasets were extensively analyzed to identify differentially expressed RNA transcripts and methylated CpG sites that can discriminate early vs. late stages and cancer vs. normal samples of LIHC with high precision. Naive Bayes model developed using 51 features that combine 21 CpG methylation sites and 30 RNA transcripts achieved maximum MCC (Matthew's correlation coefficient) 0.58 with an accuracy of 78.87% on the validation dataset in discrimination of early and late stage. Additionally, the prediction models developed based on 5 RNA transcripts and 5 CpG sites classify LIHC and normal samples with an accuracy of 96-98% and AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) 0.99. Besides, multiclass models also developed for classifying samples in the normal, early and late stage of cancer and achieved an accuracy of 76.54% and AUC of 0.86.Our study reveals stage prediction of LIHC samples with high accuracy based on the genomics and epigenomics profiling is a challenging task in comparison to the classification of cancerous and normal samples.

https://openalex.org/W2971430313,"The endogenous metabolite itaconate has emerged as a regulator of macrophage function that limits inflammation. However, its effect on cell differentiation and osteoclast-related diseases is unclear. Here, for the first time, we explored the effect of itaconate and its cell-permeable itaconate derivative, 4-octyl itaconate (OI) on osteoclast differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Firstly, we demonstrated that itaconate concentration was lower in estrogen-deficient mice. OI released itaconate and induced the expression of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in bone marrow-derived macrophages during osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, OI significantly suppressed the early, middle, and late stages of osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand in vitro, as confirmed by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. Moreover, it significantly inhibited fibrous actin ring formation and bone resorption in vitro. Mechanistically, we observed that OI enhanced Nrf2 expression by suppressing its association with ubiquitin via inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin ligase (Hrd1). OI also inhibited LPS-induced the reactive oxygen species and inflammatory responses via Hrd1. An estrogen deficiency (via ovariectomy)-induced osteoporosis model was also established. Here, on micro-computed tomography and histologic analysis showed that OI effectively suppressed ovariectomy-induced bone loss. In summary, OI, an itaconate derivative, can inhibit osteoclastogenesis in vitro and in vivo, indicating that OI could be a potential drug to treat osteoclast-related diseases; our results also link itaconate to the development of osteoporosis.-Sun, X., Zhang, B., Pan, X., Huang, H., Xie, Z., Ma, Y., Hu, B., Wang, J., Chen, Z., Shi, P.

https://openalex.org/W2971630044,"Background Despite having influenza vaccination policies and programs, countries in the Americas underutilize seasonal influenza vaccine, in part because of insufficient evidence about severe influenza burden. We aimed to estimate the annual burden of influenza-associated respiratory hospitalizations in the Americas. Methods Thirty-five countries in the Americas with national influenza surveillance were invited to provide monthly laboratory data and hospital discharges for respiratory illness (International Classification of Diseases 10th edition J codes 0–99) during 2010–2015. In three age-strata (<5, 5–64, and ≥65 years), we estimated the influenza-associated hospitalizations rate by multiplying the monthly number of respiratory hospitalizations by the monthly proportion of influenza-positive samples and dividing by the census population. We used random effects meta-analyses to pool age-group specific rates and extrapolated to countries that did not contribute data, using pooled rates stratified by age group and country characteristics found to be associated with rates. Results Sixteen of 35 countries (46%) contributed primary data to the analyses, representing 79% of the America’s population. The average pooled rate of influenza-associated respiratory hospitalization was 90/100,000 population (95% confidence interval 61–132) among children aged <5 years, 21/100,000 population (13–32) among persons aged 5–64 years, and 141/100,000 population (95–211) among persons aged ≥65 years. We estimated the average annual number of influenza-associated respiratory hospitalizations in the Americas to be 772,000 (95% credible interval 716,000–829,000). Conclusions Influenza-associated respiratory hospitalizations impose a heavy burden on health systems in the Americas. Countries in the Americas should use this information to justify investments in seasonal influenza vaccination—especially among young children and the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2972142919,"Ocean greening off Hawai'i From June to August 2018, the eruption of Kīlauea volcano triggered a diatom-dominated phytoplankton bloom. Wilson et al. set sail to sample the plume, deploying subsea gliders and using satellite monitoring to measure the dynamics of this rare event in the nutrient-poor Pacific (see the Perspective by Ducklow and Plank). They found subsurface chlorophyll maxima not visible by remote sensing, performed transcriptome and N isotope marker analysis, and measured nutrients, partitioning of biomass into different organisms, and primary production. Much of the data are corroborated by physical modeling of the ocean dynamics. The authors conclude that the plume was fed by the lava heating subsurface water and triggering upwelling of deepwater nutrients to the surface rather than by direct injection of micronutrients from lava.

https://openalex.org/W2972220067,"Previous studies compared the effects of gradual and sudden adaptation on intermanual transfer to find out whether transfer depends on awareness of the perturbation. Results from different groups were contradictory. Since results of our own study suggest that awareness depends on perturbation size, we hypothesize that awareness-related intermanual transfer will only appear after adaptation to a large, sudden perturbation but not after adaptation to a small sudden perturbation or a gradual perturbation, large or small. To confirm this, four groups (S30, G30, S75, G75) of subjects performed out-and-back reaching movements with their right arm. In a baseline block, they received veridical visual feedback of hand position. In the subsequent adaptation block, feedback was rotated by 30 deg (S30, G30) or 75 deg (S75, G75). This rotation was either introduced suddenly (S30, S75) or gradually in steps of 3 deg (G30, G75). After the adaptation block, subjects did an awareness test comprising exclusion and inclusion conditions. The experiment concluded with an intermanual transfer block, in which movements were performed with the left arm under rotated feedback, and a washout block again under veridical feedback. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate individual movement directions and group averages. The movement directions in different conditions were then used to calculate group and individual indexes of adaptation, awareness, unawareness, transfer and washout. Both awareness and transfer were larger in S75 than in other groups, while unawareness and washout were smaller in S75 than in other groups. Furthermore, the size of awareness indices correlated to intermanual transfer across subjects, even when transfer was normalized to final adaptation level. Thus, we show for the first time that the amount of intermanual transfer directly relates to the extent of awareness of the learned perturbation."
https://openalex.org/W2971830855,"Ocean acidification and ocean warming (OAW) are simultaneously occurring and could pose ecological challenges to marine life, particularly early life stages of fish that, although they are internal calcifiers, may have poorly developed acid-base regulation. This study assessed the effect of projected OAW on key fitness traits (growth, development and swimming ability) in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) larvae and juveniles. Starting at 2 days post-hatch (dph), larvae were exposed to one of three levels of PCO2 (650, 1150, 1700 μatm; pH 8.0, 7.8, 7.6) at either a cold (15°C) or warm (20°C) temperature. Growth rate, development stage and critical swimming speed (Ucrit) were repeatedly measured as sea bass grew from 0.6 to ~10.0 (cold) or ~14.0 (warm) cm body length. Exposure to different levels of PCO2 had no significant effect on growth, development or Ucrit of larvae and juveniles. At the warmer temperature, larvae displayed faster growth and deeper bodies. Notochord flexion occurred at 0.8 and 1.2 cm and metamorphosis was completed at an age of ~45 and ~60 days post-hatch for sea bass in the warm and cold treatments, respectively. Swimming performance increased rapidly with larval development but better swimmers were observed in the cold treatment, reflecting a potential trade-off between fast grow and swimming ability. A comparison of the results of this and other studies on marine fish indicates that the effects of OAW on the growth, development and swimming ability of early life stages are species-specific and that generalizing the impacts of climate-driven warming or ocean acidification is not warranted."

https://openalex.org/W2971878362,"Introduction Tobacco smoking is often more prevalent among those with lower socio-economic status (SES) in high-income countries, which can be driven by the inequalities in initiation and cessation of smoking. Smoking is a leading contributor to socio-economic disparities in health. To date, the evidence for any socio-economic inequality in smoking cessation is lacking, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study examined the association between cessation behaviours and SES of smokers from eight LMICs. Methods Data among former and current adult smokers aged 18 and older came from contemporaneous Global Adult Tobacco Surveys (2008–2011) and the International Tobacco Control Surveys (2009–2013) conducted in eight LMICs (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand and Uruguay). Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of successful quitting in the past year by SES indicators (household income/wealth, education, employment status, and rural-urban residence) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression controlling for socio-demographics and average tobacco product prices. A random effects meta-analysis was used to combine the estimates of AORs pooled across countries and two concurrent surveys for each country. Results Estimated quit rates among smokers (both daily and occasional) varied widely across countries. Meta-analysis of pooled AORs across countries and data sources indicated that there was no clear evidence of an association between SES indicators and successful quitting. The only exception was employed smokers, who were less likely to quit than their non-employed counterparts, which included students, homemakers, retirees, and the unemployed (pooled AOR≈0.8, p<0.10). Conclusion Lack of clear evidence of the impact of lower SES on adult cessation behaviour in LMICs suggests that lower-SES smokers are not less successful in their attempts to quit than their higher-SES counterparts. Specifically, lack of employment, which is indicative of younger age and lower nicotine dependence for students, or lower personal disposable income and lower affordability for the unemployed and the retirees, may be associated with quitting. Raising taxes and prices of tobacco products that lowers affordability of tobacco products might be a key strategy for inducing cessation behaviour among current smokers and reducing overall tobacco consumption. Because low-SES smokers are more sensitive to price increases, tobacco taxation policy can induce disproportionately larger decreases in tobacco consumption among them and help reduce socio-economic disparities in smoking and consequent health outcomes."

There is recent interest in a family of alarmins, including TSLP, IL-25 and IL-33, that are epithelial-derived and released upon stimulation of epithelial cells. Several genome wide association studies have found SNPs in genes encoding IL-33 to be risk factors for asthma. In two studies examining the direct role of IL-33 in eosinophils, there were differences in eosinophil responses. We sought to further characterize activation of eosinophils with IL-33 compared to activation by other cytokines and chemokines. We assessed IL-33 stimulated adhesion, degranulation, chemotaxis and cell surface protein expression in comparison to IL-3, IL-5, and eotaxin-1 on human eosinophils. Our results demonstrate that IL-33 can produce as potent eosinophil activation as IL-3, IL-5 and eotaxin-1. Thus, when considering specific cytokine targeting strategies, IL-33 will be important to consider for modulating eosinophil function."
https://openalex.org/W2971517191,"While shifts in organismal biology stemming from climate change are receiving increased attention, we know relatively little about how organisms respond to other forms of anthropogenic disturbance. The urban heat island (UHI) effect describes the capture of heat by built structures (e.g. asphalt), resulting in elevated urban temperatures. The UHI is a well-studied phenomenon, but only a handful of studies have investigated trait-based shifts resulting from the UHI, and even fewer have attempted to quantify the magnitude of the UHI experienced at the microclimate scale. Here, using a common urban exploiter, the Western black widow spider (Latrodectus hesperus), we show that the UHI experienced by spiders in July in their urban Phoenix, AZ refuges is 6°C hotter (33°C) than conditions in the refuges of spiders from Sonoran Desert habitat outside of Phoenix’s development (27°C). We then use this field microclimate UHI estimate to compare the development speed, mass gain and mortality of replicate siblings from 36 urban lineages reared at ‘urban’ and ‘desert’ temperatures. We show that extreme heat is slowing the growth of spiderlings and increasing mortality. In contrast, we show that development of male spiders to their penultimate moult is accelerated by 2 weeks. Lastly, in terms of behavioral shifts, UHI temperatures caused late-stage juvenile male spiders to heighten their foraging voracity and late-stage juvenile female spiders to curtail their web-building behavior. Trait-based approaches like the one presented herein help us better understand the mechanisms that lead to the explosive population growth of urban (sometimes invasive) species, possibly at the expense of urban biodiversity. Studies of organismal responses to the present day UHI can be used as informative surrogates that help us grasp the impact that projected climate change will have on biodiversity."

https://openalex.org/W2971672465,"Saturnalia tupiniquim is a sauropodomorph dinosaur from the Late Triassic (Carnian-c. 233 Ma) Santa Maria Formation of Brazil. Due to its phylogenetic position and age, it is important for studies focusing on the early evolution of both dinosaurs and sauropodomorphs. The osteology of Saturnalia has been described in a series of papers, but its cranial anatomy remains mostly unknown. Here, we describe the skull bones of one of its paratypes (only in the type-series to possess such remains) based on CT Scan data. The newly described elements allowed estimating the cranial length of Saturnalia and provide additional support for the presence of a reduced skull (i.e. two thirds of the femoral length) in this taxon, as typical of later sauropodomorphs. Skull reduction in Saturnalia could be related to an increased efficiency for predatory feeding behaviour, allowing fast movements of the head in order to secure small and elusive prey, a hypothesis also supported by data from its tooth and brain morphology. A principal co-ordinates analysis of the sauropodomorph jaw feeding apparatus shows marked shifts in morphospace occupation in different stages of the first 30 million years of their evolutionary history. One of these shifts is observed between non-plateosaurian and plateosaurian sauropodomorphs, suggesting that, despite also having an omnivorous diet, the feeding behaviour of some early Carnian sauropodomorphs, such as Saturnalia, was markedly different from that of later Triassic taxa. A second shift, between Late Triassic and Early Jurassic taxa, is congruent with a floral turnover hypothesis across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2972283693,"Tamoxifen is a mixed agonist/antagonist estrogen analogue that is frequently used to induce conditional gene deletion in mice using Cre-loxP mediated gene recombination. Tamoxifen is routinely employed in extremely high-doses relative to typical human doses to induce efficient gene deletion in mice. Although tamoxifen has been widely assumed to have no influence upon β-cells, the acute developmental and functional consequences of high-dose tamoxifen upon glucose homeostasis and adult β-cells are largely unknown. We tested if tamoxifen influences glucose homeostasis in male mice of various genetic backgrounds. We then carried out detailed histomorphometry studies of mouse pancreata. We also performed gene expression studies with islets of tamoxifen-treated mice and controls. Tamoxifen had modest effects upon glucose homeostasis of mixed genetic background (F1 B6129SF1/J) mice, with fasting hyperglycemia and improved glucose tolerance but without overt effects on fed glucose levels or insulin sensitivity. Tamoxifen inhibited proliferation of β-cells in a dose-dependent manner, with dramatic reductions in β-cell turnover at the highest dose (decreased by 66%). In sharp contrast, tamoxifen did not reduce proliferation of pancreatic acinar cells. β-cell proliferation was unchanged by tamoxifen in 129S2 mice but was reduced in C57Bl6 genetic background mice (decreased by 59%). Gene expression studies revealed suppression of RNA for cyclins D1 and D2 within islets of tamoxifen-treated mice. Tamoxifen has a cytostatic effect on β-cells, independent of changes in glucose homeostasis, in mixed genetic background and also in C57Bl6 mice. Tamoxifen should be used judiciously to inducibly inactivate genes in studies of glucose homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2971749355,"Presepsin, a glycoprotein produced during bacterial phagocytosis, is used as a sepsis marker for bacterial infections. However, presepsin levels are affected by renal function, and the evaluation criteria according to kidney function or in chronic kidney diseases remain controversial. Furthermore, presepsin may be increased by sample stirring, but no studies have evaluated this effect.In this study, we excluded the effect of stirring by standardizing the blood collection conditions, analyzed the influence of kidney function on presepsin concentrations, and recalculated the reference range based on the findings. EDTA-whole blood from 47 healthy subjects and 85 patients with chronic kidney disease was collected to measure presepsin by PATHFAST. Presepsin was found to be significantly correlated with the levels of creatinine (r = 0.834), eGFRcreat (r = 0.837), cystatin-C (r = 0.845), and eGFRcys (r = 0.879). Furthermore, in patients with CKD, presepsin levels stratified by eGFRcys showed a significant increase in the CKD G2 patient group and with advancing glomerular filtration rate stage. The following values were obtained: Normal: 97.6 ± 27.4 pg/mL, CKD G1: 100.2 ± 27.6 pg/mL, CKD G2: 129.7 ± 40.7 pg/mL, CKD G3: 208.1 ± 70.2 pg/mL, CKD G4: 320.2 ± 170.1 pg/mL, CKD G5: 712.8 ± 336.3 pg/mL. The reference range, calculated by a nonparametric method using 67 cases of healthy volunteers and patients with chronic kidney disease G1, was found to be 59-153 pg/mL, which was notably lower than the standard reference range currently used. Presepsin concentrations were positively correlated with a few biomarkers of renal function, indicating the necessity to consider the effect of renal function in patients with renal impairment. Using the recalculated reference range considering kidney function may improve the accuracy of evaluating presepsin for diagnosis of sepsis compared to the standard reference currently in use."
https://openalex.org/W2971676574,"Protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), a catalytically defective receptor protein tyrosine kinase (RPTK), plays an oncogenic role by activating an unidentified TKI-258 (dovitinib)-sensitive RPTK in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells. Here, we demonstrate that among TKI-258-sensitive RPTKs, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 is significantly up-regulated in ESCC tissues and cell lines. We show that PTK7 colocalizes with FGFR1 and binds it via its extracellular domain in human embryonic kidney 293 and ESCC TE-10 cells. PTK7 knockdown not only reduced ligand-free and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-induced phosphorylation of FGFR1 but also the interaction of signaling adaptor proteins with FGFR1 and activation of downstream signaling proteins in TE-10 cells. In addition, PTK7 knockdown reduced FGF-induced oncogenic phenotypes including proliferation, anchorage-independent colony formation, wound healing, and invasion in ESCC cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that PTK7 binds and activates FGFR1 independent of FGF and thus increases oncogenicity of PTK7- and FGFR1-positive cancers such as ESCC.—Shin, W.-S., Lee, H.

https://openalex.org/W2971796733,"Despite the importance of microbial activity in mobilizing arsenic in groundwater aquifers, the phylogenetic distribution of contributing microbial metabolisms is understudied. Groundwater samples from Ohio aquifers were analyzed using metagenomic sequencing to identify functional potential that could drive arsenic cycling, and revealed mechanisms for direct (i.e., Ars system) and indirect (i.e., iron reduction) arsenic mobilization in all samples, despite differing geochemical conditions. Analyses of 194 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) revealed widespread functionality related to arsenic mobilization throughout the bacterial tree of life. While arsB and arsC genes (components of an arsenic resistance system) were found in diverse lineages with no apparent phylogenetic bias, putative aioA genes (aerobic arsenite oxidase) were predominantly identified in Methylocystaceae MAGs. Both previously described and undescribed respiratory arsenate reduction potential via arrA was detected in Betaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Nitrospirae MAGs, whereas sulfate reduction potential was primarily limited to members of the Deltaproteobacteria and Nitrospirae. Lastly, iron reduction potential was detected in the Ignavibacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Nitrospirae. These results expand the phylogenetic distribution of taxa that may play roles in arsenic mobilization in subsurface systems. Specifically, the Nitrospirae are a much more functionally diverse group than previously assumed and may play key biogeochemical roles in arsenic-contaminated ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2971573586,"The five-year survival rate of patients diagnosed with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has remained static at <5% despite decades of research. With the exception of erlotinib, clinical trials have failed to demonstrate the benefit of any targeted therapy for PDAC despite promising results in preclinical animal studies. The development of more refined mouse models of PDAC which recapitulate the carcinogenic progression from non-neoplastic, adult exocrine subsets of pancreatic cells to invasive carcinoma in humans are needed to facilitate the accurate translation of therapies to the clinic. To study acinar cell-derived PDAC initiation, we developed a genetically engineered mouse model of PDAC, called KPT, utilizing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase/estrogen receptor (ESR1) fusion protein knocked into the Ptf1a locus to activate the expression of oncogenic KrasG12D and Trp53R270H alleles in mature pancreatic acinar cells. Oncogene-expressing acinar cells underwent acinar-to-ductal metaplasia, and formed pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesions following the induction of oncogene expression. After a defined latency period, oncogene-expressing acinar cells initiated the formation of highly differentiated and fibrotic tumors, which metastasized to the lungs and liver. Whole-transcriptome analysis of microdissected regions of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia and histological validation experiments demonstrated that regions of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia are characterized by the deposition of the extracellular matrix component hyaluronan. These results indicate that acinar cells expressing KrasG12D and Trp53R270H can initiate PDAC development in young adult mice and implicate hyaluronan deposition in the formation of the earliest characterized PDAC precursor lesions (and the progression of pancreatic cancer). Further studies are necessary to provide a comprehensive characterization of PDAC progression and treatment response in KPT mice and to investigate whether the KPT model could be used as a tool to study translational aspects of acinar cell-derived PDAC tumorigenesis."

The goal of this study was to determine the effect of different fertilization regimes on the macro- and micronutrients in beetroot. A 3-year field trial was set up according to a Latin square method with four types of fertilization (unfertilized control, 50 t stable manure ha−1, and 500 and 1,000 kg NPK 5-20-30 ha−1). The mineral content was determined as follows (mg 100 g−1 in fresh weight of beetroot): 14–29 P, 189–354 K, 18–34 Ca, 17–44 Mg, 0.67–1.83 Fe, 0.41–0.65 Mn and 0.28–0.44 Zn. The highest beetroot P content was determined for the treatment with stable manure, especially in a year with dry climatic conditions. The highest beetroot K content was determined for the treatment with 1,000 kg NPK 5-20-30 ha−1, but at the same time for the same treatment, a general decreasing trend of micronutrient content was determined, due to the possible antagonistic effect of added potassium. For better mineral status of beetroot, application of combined mineral and organic fertilizers supplemented with additional foliar application of micronutrients can be suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2971892672,"Noise fears represent a highly prevalent welfare problem in dogs. An online survey was performed to explore severity and progression of firework fears in dogs, and relationships with demographics, health, behaviour problems and owners’ training efforts to prevent or alleviate firework fears. Fifty-two percent of dogs in the sample (N = 1225) were at least partially affected by firework fears, and the majority developed a fear of fireworks in the first year of life, with a decreasing frequency of new occurrences up until seven years, and only few newly affected dogs beyond this age. While almost three-quarters of fearful dogs had recovered by the next morning following firework exposure, recovery took up to one day in 10%, up to one week in 12%, and several weeks or even months in >3%. Univariate analyses indicated a significant effect of breed group, age, sex, neuter status, origin and age at acquisition on severity of firework fears in dogs. However, binomial models including multiple predictors of presence/ absence of firework fears identified only age, breed group (mixed breeds being most affected), health problems, and an interaction between health problems and age as significant predictors. This discrepancy might be explained by collinearities of predictors and underlying differences between mixed-breed dogs and purebreds, such as mixed breeds being acquired from shelters more often and being neutered more often. Firework fears are highly correlated with fears of gunshots and thunder, and to a low extent with fears of other noises, but not with any other behavioural problems. Both improvement and deterioration of firework fears were frequently reported. While an early age of onset and breed differences point to a strong genetic contribution to firework fears, the data indicate that training puppies or non-fearful adults to associate the noise with positive stimuli is highly effective in preventing later development of firework fears."
https://openalex.org/W2971516548,"Antibodies are essential to functional immunity, yet the epitopes targeted by antibody repertoires remain largely uncharacterized. To aid in characterization, we developed a generalizable strategy to predict antibody-binding epitopes within individual proteins and entire proteomes. Specifically, we selected antibody-binding peptides for 273 distinct sera out of a random library and identified the peptides using next-generation sequencing. To predict antibody-binding epitopes and the antigens from which these epitopes were derived, we tiled the sequences of candidate antigens into short overlapping subsequences of length k (k-mers). We used the enrichment over background of these k-mers in the antibody-binding peptide dataset to predict antibody-binding epitopes. As a positive control, we used this approach, termed K-mer Tiling of Protein Epitopes (K-TOPE), to predict epitopes targeted by monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies of well-characterized specificity, accurately recovering their known epitopes. K-TOPE characterized a commonly targeted antigen from Rhinovirus A, predicting four epitopes recognized by antibodies present in 87% of sera (n = 250). An analysis of 2,908 proteins from 400 viral taxa that infect humans predicted seven enterovirus epitopes and five Epstein-Barr virus epitopes recognized by >30% of specimens. Analysis of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus proteomes similarly predicted 22 epitopes recognized by >30% of specimens. Twelve of these common viral and bacterial epitopes agreed with previously mapped epitopes with p-values < 0.05. Additionally, we predicted 30 HSV2-specific epitopes that were 100% specific against HSV1 in novel and previously reported antigens. Experimentally validating these candidate epitopes could help identify diagnostic biomarkers, vaccine components, and therapeutic targets. The K-TOPE approach thus provides a powerful new tool to elucidate the organisms, antigens, and epitopes targeted by human antibody repertoires."
https://openalex.org/W2971645054,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by demyelinated lesions in the central nervous system. Destruction of myelin and secondary damage to axons and neurons leads to significant disability, particularly in people with progressive MS. Accumulating evidence suggests that the potential for myelin repair exists in MS, although for unclear reasons this process fails. The cells responsible for producing myelin, the oligodendrocytes, and their progenitors, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), have been identified at the site of lesions, even in adults. Their presence suggests the possibility that endogenous remyelination without transplantation of donor stem cells may be a mechanism for myelin repair in MS. Strategies to develop novel therapies have focused on induction of signaling pathways that stimulate OPCs to mature into myelin-producing oligodendrocytes that could then possibly remyelinate lesions. We have been investigating pharmacological approaches to enhance OPC differentiation, and have identified that the combination of two agents, triiodothyronine (T3) and quetiapine, leads to an additive effect on OPC differentiation and consequent myelin production via both overlapping and distinct signaling pathways. While the ultimate production of myelin requires cholesterol biosynthesis, we identified that quetiapine enhances gene expression in this pathway more potently than T3. Two blockers of cholesterol production, betulin and simvastatin, reduced OPC differentiation into myelin producing oligodendrocytes. Elucidating the nature of agents that lead to complementary and additive effects on oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin production may pave the way for more efficient induction of remyelination in people with MS."
https://openalex.org/W2971865856,"Background During routine post-kidney transplant care, most European transplant physicians screen patients for asymptomatic bacteriuria. The usefulness of this strategy is debated. To make screening cost-effective, asymptomatic bacteriuria should be prevalent enough to justify the expense, and antibiotics should improve patient outcomes significantly if asymptomatic bacteriuria is detected. Regrettably, the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria among kidney transplant recipients is not well defined. Methods To determine the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria among kidney transplant recipients, we did a cross-sectional study among kidney transplant recipients undergoing routine surveillance in three outpatient transplant clinics in Belgium and France. We excluded patients who were in the first two months post-transplantation and/or had a urinary catheter. Asymptomatic participants who had a urine culture with one organism isolated at ≥ 105 CFU/mL were asked to provide a confirmatory urine specimen. Asymptomatic bacteriuria was defined per Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. Results We screened 500 consecutive kidney transplant recipients. Overall, the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria was 3.4% (17/500 patients). It was similarly low among kidney transplant recipients who were between 2 and 12 months after transplantation (1.3%, 1/76 patients) and those who were farther after transplantation (3.8%, 16/424 patients: p = 0.49). Asymptomatic bacteriuria was significantly associated with female gender (risk ratio 3.7, 95% CI 1.3–10.3, p = 0.007) and older age (mean age: 61 ± 12 years [bacteriuric participants], versus 53 ± 15 years [non-bacteriuric participants], p = 0.03). One participant’s colistin-resistant Escherichia coli isolate carried the globally disseminated mcr-1 gene. Conclusions Among kidney transplant recipients who are beyond the second month post-transplant, the prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is low. Further studies are needed to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of a screen-and-treat strategy for asymptomatic bacteriuria in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2971687681,"Introduction Malaria is a public health emergency in India and Odisha. The national malaria elimination programme aims to expedite early identification, treatment and follow-up of malaria cases in hot-spots through a robust health system, besides focusing on efficient vector control. This study, a result of mass screening conducted in a hot-spot in Odisha, aimed to assess prevalence, identify and estimate the risks and develop a management tool for malaria elimination. Methods Through a cross-sectional study and using WHO recommended Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT), 13221 individuals were screened. Information about age, gender, education and health practices were collected along with blood sample (5 μl) for malaria testing. Altitude, forestation, availability of a village health worker and distance from secondary health center were captured using panel technique. A multi-level poisson regression model was used to analyze association between risk factors and prevalence of malaria, and to estimate risk scores. Results The prevalence of malaria was 5.8% and afebrile malaria accounted for 79 percent of all confirmed cases. Higher proportion of Pv infections were afebrile (81%). We found the prevalence to be 1.38 (1.1664–1.6457) times higher in villages where the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) didn’t stay; the risk increased by 1.38 (1.0428–1.8272) and 1.92 (1.4428–2.5764) times in mid- and high-altitude tertiles. With regard to forest coverage, villages falling under mid- and highest-tertiles were 2.01 times (1.6194–2.5129) and 2.03 times (1.5477–2.6809), respectively, more likely affected by malaria. Similarly, villages of mid tertile and lowest tertile of education had 1.73 times (1.3392–2.2586) and 2.50 times (2.009–3.1244) higher prevalence of malaria. Conclusion Presence of ASHA worker in villages, altitude, forestation, and education emerged as principal predictors of malaria infection in the study area. An easy-to-use risk-scoring system for ranking villages based on these risk factors could facilitate resource prioritization for malaria elimination."

Information in this regard is lacking in Nepalese context. Thus, a comparative study was designed to assess association of cigarette smoking with Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL). This study was conducted among 125 current and never cigarette smokers who attended a teaching hospital in peri-urban area of Capital city of Nepal from December 2015 to June 2016. The data regarding their socio-demographic characteristic, tobacco history and HRQoL was collected using a self administered questionnaire. QoL assessment was made with the help of valid, translated version of WHO QOL-BREF. Results showed current smokers on an average used 4 sticks of cigarettes per day. Significant proportions of current smokers also consumed alcohol compared to never smokers (p <0.05). Mean difference of both overall QoL score and domain scores among both study groups were relatively small and thus, failed to reach statistical significance. On the other hand, the socio-demographic characteristics like male gender, currently earning and attaining more than higher secondary education were predictors of better HRQoL scores. According to study results, relationship between smoking status and self reported QoL is unclear. Thus, the policy makers should also focus on wider determinants of ill health and well being and not just smoking status. Further research is still needed to understand the effect of tobacco on self perceived health related quality of life."

LMO3-BORCS5 was as highly expressed as the characteristic fusion oncogene EWS/FLI1. However, the expression level of LMO3-BORCS5 at diagnosis was very low. Sanger sequencing depicted two LMO3-BORCS5 variants leading to loss of the functional domain LIM2 in LMO3 gene, and disruption of BORCS5. In vitro studies showed that LMO3-BORCS5 (i) increases proliferation, (ii) decreases expression of apoptosis-related genes and treatment sensitivity, and (iii) downregulates genes involved in differentiation and upregulates proliferative and extracellular matrix-related pathways. Remarkably, in vivo LMO3-BORCS5 demonstrated its high oncogenic potential by inducing tumors in mouse fibroblastic NIH-3T3 cell line. Moreover, BORCS5 probably acts, in vivo, as a tumor-suppressor gene. In conclusion, functional studies of fusion oncogenes at relapse are of great importance to define mechanisms involved in tumor progression and resistance to conventional treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2971419019,"Swarming is a characteristic behavior of bats that occurs in different social contexts. We studied the swarming behavior of Myotis nattereri at a maternity colony and at an autumn swarming site in South-West Germany by using synchronized sound and video recordings. Swarming was always associated with social vocalizations consisting of four frequently occurring call types. Call type A was a short call with a broadband steep-shallow-steep downward frequency modulation. Call type B consisted of two elements beginning with a broadband upward hooked element followed by a steep frequency modulated element. Call type C showed a characteristic rapid downward-upward-downward frequency modulation. Call type D was a long sinusoidal trill-like call with high variability in signal structure. All call types were recorded at the maternity colony, as well as at the autumn swarming site, but the incidence of each call type differed distinctly between the study sites. At the maternity roost, type A calls were most commonly produced. We found evidence for an individual signature in this call type and suggest that this social call has the function of a contact call in Natterer’s bats. At the autumn swarming site, type D calls were the most common social calls; in contrast, this call type was recorded only twice at the maternity roost. The occurrence of trills mainly at the autumn swarming site and their high variability suggests that trills function as male advertisement calls in M. nattereri."
https://openalex.org/W2971565706,"There is a wealth of published information on the epibiont communities of sea turtles, yet many of these studies have exclusively sampled epibionts found only on the carapace. Considering that epibionts may be found on almost all body-surfaces and that it is highly plausible to expect different regions of the body to host distinct epibiont taxa, there is a need for quantitative information on the spatial variation of epibiont communities on turtles. To achieve this, we measured how total epibiont abundance and biomass on olive ridley turtles Lepidochelys olivacea varies among four body-areas of the hosts (n = 30). We showed that epibiont loads on olive ridleys are higher, both in terms of number and biomass, on the skin than they are on the carapace or plastron. This contrasts with previous findings for other hard-shelled sea turtles, where epibionts are usually more abundant on the carapace or plastron. Moreover, the arguably most ubiquitous epibiont taxon for other hard-shelled sea turtles, the barnacle Chelonibia spp., only occurred in relatively low numbers on olive ridleys and the barnacles Stomatolepas elegans and Platylepas hexastylos are far more abundant. We postulate that these differences between the epibiont communities of different sea turtle taxa could indicate that the carapaces of olive ridley turtles provide a more challenging substratum for epibionts than do the hard shells of other sea turtles. In addition, we conclude that it is important to conduct full body surveys when attempting to produce a holistic qualitative or quantitative characterization of the epibiont communities of sea turtles."

However, little is known about the prevalence of TUD and symptom manifestation in smokers with lung cancer.The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of TUD using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria in patients diagnosed with lung cancer and analyze their tobacco use characteristics.A total of 200 histologically confirmed lung cancer patients who used tobacco within the prior 12-month period at the time of diagnosis were recruited for this study. Participants were assessed using interviewer-administered questionnaires to determine TUD symptoms and smoking-related behaviors, and self-administered Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) was also administered.The prevalence of DSM-5 TUD was 92.0% (n = 184). Of a total of 200 subjects, 23 (11.5%), 35 (17.5%), and 126 (63.0%) were classified into mild, moderate, and severe TUD categories, respectively. A total of 19 (81.3%) moderate TUD and 98 (77.8%) severe TUD patients had attempted smoking cessation. Of these subjects, 21 (21.4%) severe TUD and 12 (63.2%) moderate TUD patients tried more than three times. The number of satisfied criteria under DSM-5 TUD was positively correlated with FTND score, cumulative lifetime smoking amount, and daily smoking levels.Smokers diagnosed with lung cancer showed a high prevalence of DSM-5 TUD.

Full-length cDNA encoding interferon epsilon (IFNε) was isolated and cloned from the liver of the Arabian camel, C. dromedarius using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The sequence analysis of the camel IFNε cDNA showed a 582-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 193 amino acids with an estimated molecular weight of 21.230 kDa. A BLAST search analysis revealed that the C. dromedarius IFNε shared high sequence identity with the IFN genes of other species, such as Camelus ferus, Vicugna pacos, and Homo sapiens. Expression of the camel IFNε cDNA in Escherichia coli gave a fusion protein band of 24.97 kDa after induction with either isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside or lactose for 5 h. Recombinant IFNε protein was overexpressed in the form of inclusion bodies that were easily solubilized and refolded using SDS and KCl. The solubilized inclusion bodies were purified to apparent homogeneity using nickel affinity chromatography. We examined the effect of IFNε on two breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. In both cell lines, IFNε inhibited cell survival in a dose dependent manner as observed by MTT assay, morphological changes and apoptosis assay. Caspase-3 expression level was found to be increased in MDA-MB-231 treated cells as compared to untreated cells."

We tested the impact of an intensive intervention on demand and supply after a price increase to the social marketed condom, Protector Plus. The study occurred during a deteriorating economy and pressure to reach sustainability quickly. We highlight where strategic donor investments can impact condom programming and markets.We randomized ten purposively selected districts in Zimbabwe and assigned them to two study groups to test the impact of an intensive social marketing intervention. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental study conducted within a larger market strengthening context. We tracked sales of Protector Plus and distribution of the public sector condom monthly. We conducted baseline and follow-up surveys among consumers and traders, and used the difference-in-difference method to test the intervention's impact on condom preferences and brand equity.Protector Plus sales rebounded to previous levels after the price increase. We detected no significant difference in sales between the experimental and control districts. Among traders, there were no significant differences in brand preference for Protector Plus attributed to the intervention. Among consumers, there was a significant increase in emotional attachment and beliefs about condom efficacy in the experimental districts.Study findings demonstrate where international donor and government investments can impact condom programming and condom markets. Broader findings from the intervention highlight where investments can improve condom coverage, cost recovery, and collaboration between the public, social marketing, and commercial sectors. Strategic investments for strengthening condom markets include: consumer research to segment markets, willingness to pay studies to set price points, distribution system improvements to increase efficiency, intensive demand generation to increase demand and use, market facilitation across sectors, and market intelligence to inform decision making. When a disciplined social marketing approach is used, the market benefits: subsidies can be better targeted, branded products can appeal to the right audiences, and room can be made for the commercial sector to enter the market."

https://openalex.org/W2972125994,"Recently it has been shown that building networks from time series allows to study complex systems to characterize them when they go through a phase transition. This give us the opportunity to study this systems from a entire new point of view. In the present work we have used the natural and horizontal visualization algorithms to built networks of two popular models, which present phase transitions: the Ising model and the Kuramoto model. By measuring some topological quantities as the average degree, or the clustering coefficient, it was found that the networks retain the capability of detecting the phase transition of the system. From our results it is possible to establish that both visibility algorithms are capable of detecting the critical control parameter, as in every quantity analyzed (the average degree, the average path and the clustering coefficient) there is a minimum or a maximum value. In the case of the natural visualization algorithm, the average path results are much more noisy than in the other quantities in the study. Specially for the Kuramoto Model, which in this case does not allow a detection of the critical point at plain sight as for the other quantities. The horizontal visualization algorithm has proven to be more explicit in every quantity, as every one of them show a clear change of behavior before and after the critical point of the transition."

I was elated. I'd spent years trying to win support for my project on sea anemones—and now I could actually do the work. But hours later, I received another call—also from NSF, responding to an application I had filed 4 months earlier. “We'd like to offer you the job as program director,” said the caller. The choice before me was stark: I could continue on my academic path, or take a leap into a very different career.

> “My job at NSF filled the void I felt in my academic work.” 

Eighteen years earlier, I'd started my faculty position eager to launch my research exploring symbiotic relationships in marine organisms. But over time, I'd become more interested in mentoring students and serving as a catalyst to help others reach their goals. When I looked back on a 4-year NSF-funded research project studying coral bleaching in the Bahamas, I realized that the most rewarding aspect of it wasn't the research; it was the impact the project had on the 18 undergraduates I took into the field with me. I'd seen them transformed by the opportunity to go beyond the classroom and get hands-on experience doing research, and I'd felt I made a difference in their lives.

I had also started to feel I could have a bigger impact working outside of academia. A few years earlier, I'd taken a 2-year hiatus from my faculty job to serve as a rotating program officer at NSF, working on ocean education programs. I wanted to see how NSF worked from the inside so that I could help launch research programs at my predominantly undergraduate institution. When I went back to my faculty position, I was full of ideas about how I could help my university take advantage of NSF's programs. But my department chair told me to focus on my classes and normal faculty duties. I felt deflated. So the same month I applied for the grant, I also applied for a job overseeing NSF's fellowship program for graduate students.

When both came through, I had a tough choice to make. Most of my colleagues advised me to stay in academia, where I had a satisfying job teaching and mentoring students. But my gut told me to take a chance and try something new—so I accepted the job offer.

It wasn't an easy transition. My skill set and experiences were firmly rooted in academia, and at times I wondered whether I had what it takes to be an effective program director. But eventually, I realized that my academic experiences were assets to capitalize on, not obstacles to surmount. Teaching large classes had honed my communication skills, which proved essential when speaking with NSF's leadership team and the broader research community. Working with diverse students on class projects gave me the confidence to lead strong teams centered on common goals. I could also empathize with the academics I worked with and help them navigate the ins and outs of NSF.

Best of all, my job at NSF filled the void I felt in my academic work. As a professor, I had an impact on scores of students each year. Now, I felt I was making a difference for the thousands of students who applied to the program each year—for instance, by revising the application materials to be more inclusive and by training reviewers to take a broader view of applicants' qualifications. I celebrated the fellows' successes as if I were their adviser.

After 10 years at the agency, I retired this past May. If I'd stayed in academia, I would have maintained some status as a professor emeritus. But now, when I search for my name on NSF's staff directory, it's gone—as if I no longer exist. So, I remind myself why I chose the government: to enable others, especially students, to make new scientific discoveries and to chart their own—hopefully fulfilling—career paths.
