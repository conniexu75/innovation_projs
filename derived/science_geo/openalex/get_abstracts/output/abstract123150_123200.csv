https://openalex.org/W2096551755,"Quantum computation remains an enormously appealing but elusive goal. It is appealing because of its potential to perform superfast algorithms, such as finding prime factors in polynomial time, but also elusive because of the difficulty of simultaneously manipulating quantum degrees of freedom while preventing environmentally induced decoherence. A new approach to quantum computing is introduced based on the use of multiple-pulse resonance techniques to manipulate the small deviation from equilibrium of the density matrix of a macroscopic ensemble so that it appears to be the density matrix of a much lower dimensional pure state. A complete prescription for quantum computing is given for such a system."

https://openalex.org/W2167395325,"Since 1990, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has screened more than 60,000 compounds against a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines. The 50-percent growth-inhibitory concentration (GI 50 ) for any single cell line is simply an index of cytotoxicity or cytostasis, but the patterns of 60 such GI 50 values encode unexpectedly rich, detailed information on mechanisms of drug action and drug resistance. Each compound's pattern is like a fingerprint, essentially unique among the many billions of distinguishable possibilities. These activity patterns are being used in conjunction with molecular structural features of the tested agents to explore the NCI's database of more than 460,000 compounds, and they are providing insight into potential target molecules and modulators of activity in the 60 cell lines. For example, the information is being used to search for candidate anticancer drugs that are not dependent on intact p53 suppressor gene function for their activity. It remains to be seen how effective this information-intensive strategy will be at generating new clinically active agents."

https://openalex.org/W2129846302,"INFORMATION processing in the cerebral cortex invariably involves the activation of millions of neurons that are widely distributed over its various areas. These distributed activity patterns need to be integrated into coherent representational states. A candidate mechanism for the integration and coordination of neuronal activity between different brain regions is synchronization on a fine temporal scale1–3. In the visual cortex, synchronization occurs selectively between the responses of neurons that represent related features2–5 and that need to be integrated for the generation of coherent percepts; neurons in other areas of the cerebral cortex also synchronize their discharges6–10. However, little is known about the patterns and the behavioural correlates of synchrony among widely separated cortical regions. Here we report that synchronization occurs between areas of the visual and parietal cortex, and between areas of the parietal and motor cortex, in the awake cat. When cats responded to a sudden change of a visual pattern, neuronal activity in cortical areas exhibited synchrony without time lags; this synchrony was particularly strong between areas subserving related functions. During reward and inter-trial episodes, zero-time-lag synchrony was lost and replaced by interactions exhibiting large and unsystematic time lags."

https://openalex.org/W2023343774,"The regio- and stereospecificity of bimolecular phenoxy radical coupling reactions, of especial importance in lignin and lignan biosynthesis, are clearly controlled in some manner in vivo; yet in vitro coupling by oxidases, such as laccases, only produce racemic products. In other words, laccases, peroxidases, and comparable oxidases are unable to control regio- or stereospecificity by themselves and thus some other agent must exist. A 78-kilodalton protein has been isolated that, in the presence of an oxidase or one electron oxidant, effects stereoselective bimolecular phenoxy radical coupling in vitro. Itself lacking a catalytically active (oxidative) center, its mechanism of action is presumed to involve capture of E-coniferyl alcohol-derived free-radical intermediates, with consequent stereoselective coupling to give (+)-pinoresinol."

https://openalex.org/W2038212272,"THE effector arm of the cell-death pathway is composed of cysteine proteases belonging to the ICE/CED-3 family1,2. In metazoan cells these exist as inactive polypeptide precursors (zymogens), each composed of a prodomain, which is cleaved to activate the protease, and a large and small catalytic subunit. The coupling of these 'death' proteases to signalling pathways is probably mediated by adaptor molecules that contain protein–protein interaction motifs such as the death domain1. Here we describe such an adaptor molecule, RAIDD, which has an unusual bipartite architecture comprising a carboxy-terminal death domain that binds to the homologous domain in RIP, a serine/threonine kinase component of the death pathway3,4. The amino-terminal domain is surprisingly homologous with the sequence of the prodomain of two ICE/CED-3 family members, human ICH-1 (ref. 5) and Caenorhabditis elegans CED-3 (ref. 6). This similar region mediates the binding of RAIDD to ICH-1 and CED-3, serving as a direct link to the death proteases, indicating that the prodomain may, through homophilic interactions, determine the specificity of binding of ICE/CED-3 zymogens to regulatory adaptor molecules. Finally, alternations in the sequence of the N-terminal domain that are equivalent to inactivating mutations in the C. elegans ced-3 gene7,8 prevent homophilic binding, highlighting the potentially primordial nature of this interaction."

https://openalex.org/W2065661471,"Permanent removal of axonal input to postsynaptic cells helps shape the pattern of neuronal connections in response to experience, but the process is poorly understood. Intracellular recording from newborn and adult mouse muscle fibers temporarily innervated by two axons showed an increasing disparity in the synaptic strengths of the two inputs before one was eliminated. The connection that survived gained strength by increasing the amount of neurotransmitter released (quantal content), whereas the input that was subsequently removed became progressively weaker, because of a reduction in quantal content and a reduction in quantal efficacy associated with reduced postsynaptic receptor density. Once the synaptic strengths of two inputs began to diverge, complete axonal withdrawal of the weaker input occurred within 1 to 2 days. These experiments provide a link between experience-driven changes in synaptic strength and long-term changes in connectivity in the mammalian nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2055161902,"Bedrock landsliding is a dominant geomorphic process in a number of high-relief landscapes, yet is neglected in landscape evolution models. A physical model of sliding in beans is presented, in which incremental lowering of one wall simulates baselevel fall and generates slides. Frequent small slides produce irregular hillslopes, on which steep toes and head scarps persist until being cleared by infrequent large slides. These steep segments are observed on hillslopes in high-relief landscapes and have been interpreted as evidence for increases in tectonic or climatic process rates. In certain cases, they may instead reflect normal hillslope evolution by landsliding."

https://openalex.org/W2006554929,"Magneto-optical imaging was used to visualize the inhomogeneous penetration of magnetic flux into polycrystalline TlBa 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O x films with high critical current densities, to reconstruct the local two-dimensional supercurrent flow patterns and to correlate inhomogeneities in this flow with the local crystallographic misorientation. The films have almost perfect c -axis alignment and considerable local a - and b -axis texture because the grains tend to form colonies with only slightly misaligned a and b axes. Current flows freely over these low-angle grain boundaries but is strongly reduced at intermittent colony boundaries of high misorientation. The local (&lt;10-micrometer scale) critical current density J c varies widely, being up to 10 times as great as the transport J c (scale of ∼1 millimeter), which itself varies by a factor of about 5 in different sections of the film. The combined experiments show that the magnitude of the transport J c is largely determined by a few high-angle boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W2044152098,"Paleomagnetic data show less than ∼1000 kilometers of motion between the paleomagnetic and hotspot reference frames—that is, true polar wander—during the past 100 million years, which implies that Earth's rotation axis has been very stable. This long-term rotational stability can be explained by the slow rate of change in the large-scale pattern of plate tectonic motions during Cenozoic and late Mesozoic time, provided that subducted lithosphere is a major component of the mantle density heterogeneity generated by convection. Therefore, it is unnecessary to invoke other mechanisms, such as sluggish readjustment of the rotational bulge, to explain the observed low rate of true polar wander."
https://openalex.org/W1985356060,"INTERGALACTIC gas clouds at high redshifts have element abundances that are close to primordial. The ratio of deuterium to hydrogen (D/H) within such clouds—which is determined from absorption lines in the spectra of more distant quasars that lie along the same line of sight—provides the best estimate of the density of baryons (ΩB) in the Universe. Previous estimates of D/H in the early Universe have yielded values that differ by about an order of magnitude1–7, with the lower values6,7 implying a high density of baryons that may be difficult to reconcile with both estimates of the primordial abundances of other light elements (especially 4He) and the known number of light neutrinos8–10. The accuracy of such D/H determinations is heavily dependent on the inferred column density of neutral hydrogen in the absorbing clouds. Here we report an independent measurement of the neutral hydrogen column density in the cloud towards the quasar Q1937 – 1009, for which one of the low D/H values was derived6. Our measurement requires a substantial revision to the D/H value reported previously; we obtain a lower limit of D/H > 4 × 10−5 for this cloud, which implies ΩB <0.016 for a Hubble constant of 100 km s−1 Mpc−1. This reduced upper limit for the baryon density relieves any conflict with standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis6."
