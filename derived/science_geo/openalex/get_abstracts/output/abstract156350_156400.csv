https://openalex.org/W2005278252,"Many p53-inducible genes have been identified that might play a role in mediating the various downstream activities of p53. We have identified a close relative of ribonucleotide reductase, recently named p53R2, as a p53-inducible gene, and show that this gene is activated by several stress signals that activate a p53 response, including DNA damaging agents and p14(ARF). p53R2 expression was induced by p53 mutants that are defective for the activation of apoptosis, but retain cell cycle arrest function, although no induction of p53R2 was seen in response to p21(WAF1/CIP1)-mediated cell cycle arrest. Several isoforms of the p53 family member p73 were also shown to induce p53R2 expression. Transient ectopic expression of either wild type p53R2 or p53R2 targeted to the nucleus, did not significantly alter cell cycle progression in unstressed cells. The identification of this gene as a p53 target supports a direct role for p53 in DNA repair, in addition to inhibition of growth of damaged cells. Oncogene (2000) 19, 4283 - 4289"

Treatment of cells with the MAPK kinase inhibitor, PD 98059, prevented both T4-induced nuclear MAPK-TR co-immunoprecipitation and serine phosphorylation of TR. T4 treatment caused dissociation of TR and SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor), an effect also inhibited by PD 98059 and presumptively a result of association of nuclear MAPK with TR. Transfection into CV-1 cells of TR gene constructs in which one or both zinc fingers in the TR DNA-binding domain were replaced with those from the glucocorticoid receptor localized the site of TR phosphorylation by T4-activated MAPK to a serine in the second zinc finger of the TR DNA-binding domain. In an in vitro cell- and hormone-free system, purified activated MAPK phosphorylated recombinant human TRβ1 ().

Davis F.B. Gordinier J.K. Martino L.J. Davis P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1014-C1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, through serine phosphorylation by MAPK, can enhance the activity of several nuclear transactivator proteins. Among the latter are the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins that mediate growth factor (2Lin H.-Y. Shih A. Davis F.B. Davis P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and cytokine (1Lin H.-Y. Davis F.B. Gordinier J.K. Martino L.J. Davis P.J. Am. J.

This T4 effect is initiated by a G protein-coupled receptor in the plasma membrane (1Lin H.-Y. Davis F.B. Gordinier J.K. Martino L.J. Davis P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1014-C1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been observed in cells that contain endogenous nuclear thyroid hormone receptor (TR), such as 293T cells and human skin fibroblasts (BG-9), and in cells which are devoid of functional TR (CV-1 and HeLa (4Selmi S. Samuels H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11589-11593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). In contrast, genomic actions of thyroid hormone require binding of the hormone, predominantly 3,5,3′-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3), by specific receptors in the cell nucleus. T3-liganded TR may bind as a monomer or a homo- or heterodimer with retinoid X receptor to thyroid hormone response elements in the regulatory upstream regions of specific hormone-responsive genes (5Yen P. Sugawara A. Chin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23248-23252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lazar M.A. Endocr.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 17-34Google Scholar). In the absence of T3, TR exists in the transcriptionally inactive (repressed) state. This state is imposed by the binding to unliganded TR of the co-repressor proteins, SMRT (silencing mediator ofretinoid and thyroid hormone receptors) and NCoR (nuclear co-repressor) (8Tagami T. Gu W.X. Peairs P.T. West B.L. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1888-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). SMRT binding to TR has been localized to the hinge region of the receptor (amino acids 211–240) (9Safer J.D. Cohen R.N. Hollenberg A.N. Wondisford F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30175-30182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Binding of T3 to TR results in dissociation of co-repressor proteins from TR and the recruitment of activator proteins that facilitate enhanced transcriptional activity of the receptor (10Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation of TR isoforms has been described by several laboratories (11Tzagarakis-Foster C. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol.

In such studies phosphorylation has been inferred from stimulation of the activity of cellular cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (11Tzagarakis-Foster C. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10926-10932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Leitman D.C. Costa C.H.R.M. Graf H. Baxter J.D. Ribiero R.C.J. J. Biol.

Bhat M.K. Wong R. Cheng S.-y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4129-4134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Jones K.E. Brubaker J.H. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There have been several results of such phosphorylation in these model systems. For example, serine phosphorylation of TRα1 has been shown to decrease TR monomer binding to DNA (11Tzagarakis-Foster C. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10926-10932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TRβ1 is selectively stabilized against protease degradation by serine phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of the receptor is significantly increased (14Ting Y.-T. Bhat M.K. Wong R. Cheng S.-y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4129-4134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Ting Y.-T. Cheng S.-y. Thyroid. 1997; 7: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Leitmanet al. (12Leitman D.C. Costa C.H.R.M. Graf H. Baxter J.D. Ribiero R.C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21950-21955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have also shown increased transcriptional activity of TRβ1 in response to phosphorylation. Comparing phosphorylatable and nonphosphorylatable forms of TRα2, Katzet al. (17Katz D. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2341-2348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that serine phosphorylation of the receptor isoform decreased its ability to heterodimerize with retinoid X receptor at a thyroid hormone response element site. Using a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor, H7, Jones et al. (16Jones K.E. Brubaker J.H. Chin W.W. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) showed a reduction in T3-induced transcriptional activity of both TRα1 and TRβ1. In some of these studies (12Leitman D.C. Costa C.H.R.M. Graf H. Baxter J.D. Ribiero R.C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21950-21955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the results were highly cell line-specific. The mechanism by which serine phosphorylation of TRβ1 is achieved is unclear, aside from the possible involvement of PKA (11Tzagarakis-Foster C. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10926-10932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Leitman D.C. Costa C.H.R.M. Graf H. Baxter J.D. Ribiero R.C.J. J. Biol.

In the study reported here, we describe a signal transduction mechanism by which T4, acting at the cell surface, promotes MAPK-dependent serine phosphorylation of TRβ1 and resultant dissociation of TR and SMRT. We also identify a region of TRβ1 that is required for MAPK binding to the receptor. l-T4,l-T3, d-T4,d-T3, 3,3′,5′-triiodothyronine (rT3), tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac), 3,5,3′-triiodothyroacetic acid (triac), 8-bromo-cyclic-AMP (8-Br-cAMP), myelin basic protein (MBP), 6-n-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU), T4-agarose, and protein A-agarose were obtained from Sigma. Stock solutions of thyroid hormone and analogues were prepared in 0.04n KOH, 4% propylene glycol, and dilutions were made to final analogue concentrations as indicated. In all experiments in which T4 was added to cultured cells, the total and free T4 concentrations were 10−7 and 10−10m, respectively, and total and free T3 concentrations were below the limits of detection. PD 98059 was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and geldanamycin was from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch of the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD). Stock solutions of these inhibitors were prepared in 100% Me2SO, so that a final concentration of 0.1% Me2SO was achieved in cell cultures and had no effect on experimental results. KT5720 was obtained from Kamiya Biomedical Co. (Thousand Oaks, CA). LipofectAMINE Plus was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.

Yen (NIDDK, NIH, Bethesda, MD), as were a TGT hybrid construct of TRβ1 with the DBD of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) substituted for that of TR (provided with permission of Dr. Ronald Evans, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) and two TR hybrid mutants in which one or the other zinc finger of the TR DBD is replaced with the corresponding zinc finger of GR (T-TG-T or T-GT-T; obtained with permission of Dr. J. Larry Jameson, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). Recombinant TRβ1 (residues 102–461) was generously provided by Dr. Brian L. West (Metabolic Research Unit, University of California-San Francisco, CA). TR-replete 293T cells were obtained from Dr. K. Pumiglia (Albany Medical College, Albany, NY); CV-1 cells, which lack TR, were on hand in the laboratory (1Lin H.-Y. Davis F.B. Gordinier J.K. Martino L.J. Davis P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1014-C1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cells were maintained and grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Almost confluent cells were placed for 2 days in medium containing 0.25% serum that had been previously depleted of thyroid hormone by the method of Samuels et al. (18Samuels H.H. Stanley F. Casanova J. Endocrinology. 1979; 105: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), as modified by Weinstein et al. (19Weinstein S.P. Watts J. Graves P.N. Haber R.S. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1421-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and then in serum-free medium for 2 h. Cells were then treated with T4 or other analogues for the times indicated. In selected experiments the inhibitors PD 98059 and geldanamycin were added to cells for 5 h, and T4 was added for the last 30 min; KT5720 was added for 70 min, and 8-Br-cAMP and T4 were added for the last 30 min of KT5720 incubation. After cell treatment, cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared as follows: the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in hypotonic buffer as described previously (1Lin H.-Y. Davis F.B. Gordinier J.K. Martino L.J. Davis P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1014-C1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Lin H.-Y. Shih A. Davis F.B. Davis P.J. Biochem.

After sample centrifugation at 4 °C and 13,000 rpm for 1 min, supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic extracts. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Wen et al. (20Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar) by resuspension of the crude nuclei in high salt buffer (hypotonic buffer with 20% glycerol and 420 mm NaCl) at 4 °C with rocking for 30 min. The supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 4 °C and 14,000 × g for 10 min. Following normalization of sample protein content, immunoprecipitation was performed using polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), monoclonal antibody to the amino-terminal or carboxyl-terminal halves of the amino-terminal (AB) domain (amino acids 1-93 of TRβ1 (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), polyclonal antibody to amino acids 73–93 of rat TRβ1 (generously provided by Dr. William W. Chin, Indianapolis, IN), monoclonal antibody to amino acids 235–414 of human TRβ1 (C3 antibody, Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., Golden, CO), monoclonal antibody to MAPK (Transduction), polyclonal anti-phosphoserine (Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ), or polyclonal antibody to tyrosine/threonine-phosphorylated MAPK (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). After overnight incubation of samples at 4 °C with rocking, protein A-agarose was added, and samples were rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. After two washes with hypotonic buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, immunoprecipitates were eluted with 2× sample buffer and proteins (10 μg of protein/sample) were resolved on discontinuous SDS-PAGE gel (7.5–9.0%). Proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by electroblotting. After blocking with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween, membranes were immunoblotted with one of several antibodies including monoclonal anti-MAPK or -TRβ1, polyclonal anti-tyrosine/threonine-phosphorylated MAPK, anti-phosphoserine, anti-phosphothreonine (Research Diagnostics), anti-TRβ1, or anti-SMRT (Santa Cruz). The secondary antibodies were rabbit anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit, or donkey anti-goat IgG (1:1000, DAKO Corporation, Carpenteria, CA). Immunoblots were visualized by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantitated by digital imaging (BioImage, Millipore). The possibility of nonspecific immunoprecipitation was ruled out by use of anti-HLA-DRα for immunoprecipitation, followed by MAPK immunoblot of the immunoprecipitated proteins; no MAPK was detectable. Supernatants from TRβ1 immunoprecipitation contained no TRβ1, indicating that the immunoprecipitation was complete. Immunoblots shown in the figures are representative of three or more experiments. The DNA samples for TRβ1, two truncated mutants (TR-ΔN and TR-LBD), and three hybrid constructs (TGT, T-GT-T, and T-TG-T), in the pcDNA expression vector were transformed into competent DH5α cells and plated on ampicillin-treated agar plates. Single colonies were chosen and grown overnight in Circle Grow culture broth (Bio101, Carlsbad, CA) containing ampicillin (10 mg/ml). Plasmid DNA was isolated and purified by a modified alkaline lysis protocol (RPM4G kit, Bio101). CV-1 cells were transfected with TRβ1 or mutants in pcDNA or with pcDNA alone using LipofectAMINE Plus according to supplier's instructions. Cells grown to 60% confluence in serum-free, antibiotic-free medium were replenished with 5 ml of fresh medium, and LipofectAMINE/DNA mixtures previously prepared were then added, followed by incubation for 6 h at 37 °C. An equal volume of medium containing 20% T4-depleted serum was then added to the DNA-LipofectAMINE Plus mixture, and the cells were incubated for an additional 6–8 h. The medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10−3m PTU and 0.25% T4-depleted serum, and the cells were incubated for 16 h and then treated with T4(10−7m) or diluent for 30 min and harvested for preparation of nuclei as described above. Nuclear samples were immunoblotted with a TRβ1 antibody that detects TRβ1 and all mutants or were immunoprecipitated with the same antibody, and precipitated proteins were then separated by PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies to MAPK, phosphoserine, or phosphothreonine. 5 μg of recombinant TRβ1 (amino acids 102–461) were immunoprecipitated with C3 antibody, and the immunoprecipitated protein eluted from protein A-agarose. The immunoprecipitate was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 5 units of activated MAPK (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 20 μmATP containing 0.05 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), following the method of Kato et al. (21Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated TRβ1 from 293T cells was also exposed to activated MAPK. Control samples contained 1 μg of MBP instead of TRβ1. After incubation proteins were solubilized, separated by PAGE, and radioautographed. Human embryonic kidney (293T) cells contain endogenous TRβ1. To study co-immunoprecipitation, or complexing, of TRβ1 and MAPK, nuclear fractions were prepared from 293T cell lysates of control samples and of cells treated with T4 (10−7m) for 10–90 min and were immunoprecipitated with antibody to the carboxyl-terminal half of the AB domain of TRβ1. The immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to membranes for immunoblotting with antibody to MAPK. Shown in Fig.1 A is a representative immunoblot. There is an increase in nuclear MAPK complexed with TRβ1 immunoprecipitates that reaches a peak in 40 min (22-fold increase over control in the figure, decreasing to 12-fold in 90 min). In nine experiments, the fold increases in nuclear MAPK associated with TRβ1 in 30 and 40 min were 6.7 ± 1.5 (mean ± S.E.) and 8.6 ± 2.5, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1 B. These changes parallel the timing of T4-induced increases in tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of MAPK that we have previously reported (1Lin H.-Y. Davis F.B. Gordinier J.K. Martino L.J. Davis P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1014-C1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In studies using a selective antibody to tyrosine/threonine-phosphorylated, or activated, MAPK for immunoblotting of TRβ1 immunoprecipitates, we observed 21- and 24-fold increases in activated MAPK in 30 and 40 min, respectively (Fig. 1 C). In additional experiments, nuclear fractions were immunoprecipitated with antibody to phosphorylated MAPK, and the resulting proteins were immunoblotted with anti-TRβ1, thus reversing the antibody order. Again, complexing of TRβ1 and MAPK was found, with 1.4- and 7.8-fold increases in TRβ1 bands in 30 and 40 min of T4 treatment, respectively (not shown). We have therefore demonstrated that T4 in a physiologic concentration can transiently 1) activate MAPK causing its translocation to the nucleus and 2) promote the association of activated MAPK with TRβ1 in an immunoprecipitable complex. This effect of T4 occurs in as early as 10 min and persists for up to 90 min. Studies utilizing antibody to the amino-terminal half of the AB domain of TRβ1 demonstrated similar results, as did studies with a polyclonal antibody to amino acids 73–93 of the rat TRβ1 AB domain (not shown). In time course experiments similar to the study shown in Fig.1 A, nuclear extracts of 293T cells treated with T4 were immunoblotted with TRβ1 antibody without prior immunoprecipitation; Western blots demonstrated 2–5-fold increases in nuclear TRβ1 in 10–60 min, respectively, as shown in Fig.2 A. Nuclear samples were also immunoprecipitated with monoclonal TRβ1 antibody, and the precipitates were subjected to PAGE and immunoblotted with polyclonal anti-TRβ1 (Fig. 2 B). Again, progressive nuclear accumulation of the receptor during T4 treatment is seen.Figure 1Accumulation in 293T cell nuclei of co-immunoprecipitated TR β1 and MAPK.A, nuclear fractions of 293T cells treated with 10−7m T4 for 10–90 min or with T4 diluent were immunoprecipitated with antibody to the carboxyl-terminal half of the AB domain of TRβ1, and the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-MAPK. In all studies 10 μg of protein from each sample was used for gel electrophoresis. The MAPK antibody reacts principally with ERK2 (42 kDa). There was time-dependent association of TRβ1 and MAPK in from 10–90 min, with a maximal 22-fold effect at 40 min. B, graphic results of nine experiments performed as in A are shown as mean ± S.E. of the fold increase in band integrated optical density (I.O.D.) of each sample compared with the untreated samples shown at left (value = 1). Increases (mean ± S.E.) of 6.7 ± 1.5-fold (p < 0.0025; one-way analysis of variance) and 8.6 ± 2.5-fold (p < 0.01), respectively, in 30 and 40 min were seen in nine experiments. Significance is shown as follows: ***,p < 0.001; **, p < 0.025; and *,p < 0.01. C, an experiment conducted as described for A utilized antibody to tyrosine/threonine-phosphorylated MAPK for immunoblotting of TRβ1 immunoprecipitates and shows maximal complexing with TRβ1 at 30–40 min. This antibody detects both ERK1 and ERK2. In four experiments, there were significant fold increases in activated MAPK in 10 min (10.3 ± 3.8, p < 0.05), 30 min (13.1 ± 3.2, p < 0.01), 40 min (24.1 ± 8.6,p < 0.05), and 90 min (4.4 ± 1.0,p < 0.025).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 2Effect of T4 on nuclear accumulation of TR β1 and evidence of cytosolic TR β1 in 293T cells. A, 293T cells were treated with 10−7m T4for 10–90 min as in experiments shown in Fig. 1. Nuclear proteins were immunoblotted with antibody to the carboxyl-terminal half of the AB domain of TRβ1. Compared with untreated cells, there was a 2–5-fold increase in nuclear TRβ1 in 10–60 min in the study shown, and in seven studies there was a 2.1 ± 0.3-fold (p < 0.01) increase in 30 min. B, nuclear samples of the 293T cells shown in A were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal TRβ1 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by PAGE and immunoblotted with polyclonal antibody to amino acids 62–82 in the AB domain of TRβ1. A time-dependent increase in nuclear TRβ1 with T4 treatment is again seen. C, 293T cells treated with T4 for 30 min display increased TRβ1 in the nuclear fraction compared with that of cells not treated with hormone. In four experiments the increase with T4 was 2.0 ± 0.6-fold. However, cytosolic TRβ1 is less concentrated and does not appear to change with T4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We determined in 293T cells whether T4 treatment for 30 min altered the abundance of TRβ1 per unit of nuclear fraction protein (10 μg of protein/lane). A representative blot is shown in Fig.2 C. It is assumed that the increase in nuclear TRβ1 originated from the pool of cytosolic TRβ1 also shown in this figure. We have also found cytosolic TRβ1 in another cell line (NIH3T3 cells; not shown), and others have reported the presence of TR in cytoplasm (22Zhu X.-G. Hanover J.A. Hager G.L. Cheng S.-y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27058-27063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Extranuclear TRβ1 concentration in our studies was 4.5 ± 2.5% of nuclear receptor concentration, where relative concentration was expressed as band integrated optical density per 10 μg of lane protein. The pool of cytosolic TRβ1 may be larger than Fig.2 C implies, however, given the 2-fold greater concentration of total protein in cytoplasm than in nuclear fractions and the relative volumes of nucleus and cytosol in intact cells. We have previously reported that physiologic concentrations of T4 are more effective in nongenomic models of hormone action than physiologic concentrations of T3 (1Lin H.-Y. Davis F.B. Gordinier J.K.

We therefore studied whether d-T4, d-T3, rT3, tetrac, and triac caused complexing of TRβ1 and MAPK in 293T cell nuclei. In Fig.3 A T4 is shown to enhance co-immunoprecipitation of TRβ1 and MAPK by 11.6-fold. In contrast, l-T3 in concentrations of 10−10 and 10−7m was ineffective in promoting this complex in five studies.d-T4, d-T3, and rT3 were similarly inactive in the same studies compared with control cells. The ability of both tetrac and triac (10−7m) to block the effect of T4is seen in Fig. 3 B. In this study T4 enhanced the amount of MAPK in the TRβ1 immunoprecipitate 10.4-fold. Tetrac and triac had negligible effects when present alone, but both analogues almost completely blocked T4 action. To study the contribution of the T4-activated MAPK pathway to the complexing of MAPK and TRβ1, the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 was used. MEK is a dual tyrosine-threonine kinase that activates MAPK, a serine or threonine kinase (23Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PD 98059 (30 μm) blocks T4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of MAPK (1Lin H.-Y. Davis F.B. Gordinier J.K. Martino L.J. Davis P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1014-C1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the complexing of MAPK with both STAT1α and STAT3 (2Lin H.-Y. Shih A. Davis F.B. Davis P.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 293T cells were pretreated with PD 98059 (30 μm) for 5 h and with T4 (10−7m) for the last 30 min. Fig. 4 A demonstrates T4-induced co-immunoprecipitation of TRβ1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated MAPK, with a 2.4-fold increase in activated MAPK in T4-treated cells (comparing lanes 1 and2). PD 98059 inhibited the T4 effect by 88% in the study shown (lane 2 versus lane 3). Additional studies examined the effect of PD 98059 on serine phosphorylation of TRβ1. Samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-TRβ1, and precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-phosphoserine. In the experiment shown in Fig.4 B, there is 2.9-fold enhancement of TRβ1 serine phosphorylation by T4 (lanes 1 and 2) and 97% inhibition of serine phosphorylation by PD 98059 (lanes 2 and 3). Because a role for PKA in the serine phosphorylation of TRβ1 has been suggested (11Tzagarakis-Foster C. Privalsky M.L. J. Biol.

In the study shown in Fig. 5 A, T4 enhanced 293T cell nuclear uptake of TRβ1 complexed with MAPK 7.7-fold (lane 2). KT5720 inhibited T4-induced complexing of TRβ1 and MAPK (lanes 3 and 4, 33 and 61% inhibition, respectively). 8-Br-cAMP added to the effect of T4 (lane 8) and was itself agonistic (lane 5). The effect of 8-Br-cAMP was also partially blocked by KT5720 (lanes 6 and7). To further study whether the effect of 8-Br-cAMP on nuclea"

Although many paracrine interactions between breast carcinoma cells and myofibroblasts have been characterized, the event(s) which initiate desmoplasia have remained undefined. Our studies utilized c-rasH transfected MCF-7 cells which overexpress ras p2l and which are weakly tumorigenic in ovariectomized nude mice. The xenografts are desmoplastic and comprised of 30% myofibroblasts and 60 mg/g of interstitial collagen. In situ hybridization studies of these xenografts reveal a stromal gene expression pattern (stromelysin-3, IGF-II and TIMP-1) identical to that observed in human tumor desmoplasia. 17-beta estradiol increases c-rasH MCF-7 growth but abolishes desmoplasia. c-rasH MCF-7 in vitro constitutively produce myofibroblast mitogenic activity which competes with PDGF in a receptor binding assay. This myofibroblast mitogenic activity is unaltered by 17-beta estradiol/tamoxifen pretreatment in vitro. Transfection of c-rasH MCF-7 with a PDGF-A dominant negative mutant, 1308, produced by site-directed mutagenesis (serine-->cysteine129) reduces both homo- and heterodimer secretion of PDGF by as much as 90% but does not interfere with the secretion of other growth factors. Clones with low PDGF, though tumorigenic, are non-desmoplastic. Our results suggest that breast carcinoma-secreted PDGF is the major initiator of tumor desmoplasia."

The p15 form of truncated Bid (tBid) translocates to mitochondria and induces cytochrome c release, leading to the activation of downstream caspases and apoptosis. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism by which tBid regulated cytochromec release in terms of its relationship to mitochondrial permeability transition and Bax, another Bcl-2 family protein. We employed an in vitro reconstitution system as well as cell cultures and an animal model to reflect the physiological environment where Bid could be functional. We found that induction of cytochromec release by tBid was not accompanied by a permeability transition even at high doses. Indeed, inhibition of permeability transition did not suppress the activity of tBid in vitronor could they block Fas activation-induced, Bid-dependent hepatocyte apoptosis in cultures. Furthermore, Mg2+, although inhibiting permeability transition, actually enhanced the ability of tBid to induce cytochrome c release. We also found that tBid did not require Bax to induce cytochrome crelease in vitro. In addition, mice deficient inbax were still highly susceptible to anti-Fas-induced hepatocyte apoptosis, in which cytochrome c release was unaffected. Moreover, although Bax-induced cytochrome crelease was not dependent on tBid, the two proteins could function synergistically. We conclude that Bid possesses the biochemical activity to induce cytochrome c release through a mechanism independent of mitochondrial permeability transition pore and Bax.

Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5127) Google Scholar), whereas other death signals, such as growth factor deprivation or ionizing radiation, induce mitochondrial damage, including the release of cytochrome c into cytosol, which binds to Apaf-1 and activates caspase-9 in the presence of dATP (8Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of the initiator caspases, caspase-8 or caspase-9, leads to the activation of downstream effector caspases, such as caspases-3, -6, and -7, which cleave a number of cellular proteins, facilitating the final destruction of the cell (7Ashkenazi A.

Interestingly, Bid, a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, is a substrate of caspase-8 and is activated by the Fas/TNF-R1 pathway (20Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X.

Once translocated to mitochondria, the cleaved C-terminal Bid (tBid) potently induces cytochrome c release (20Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3068) Google Scholar, 21Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Thus, Bid connects the death receptor pathway and the mitochondria pathway and is responsible for cytochrome c release and the downstream caspase activities after Fas/TNF-R1 activation. This Bid-mediated mitochondria pathway seems to be critical in certain types of cells, such as hepatocytes. Thus, bid-deficient mice are resistant to anti-Fas-induced hepatic failure and lethality (23Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that many death stimuli can induce cytochromec release, the pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins are the only well defined proteins that possess the biochemical capability to do so. However, the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. One major hypothesis is that the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) pore is involved, as shown for Bax by a number of investigators (18Pastorino J.G. Tafani M. Rothman R.J. Marcineviciute A. Hoek J.B. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31734-31739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 24Marzo I. Brenner C. Zamzami N. Jurgensmeier J.M.

Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). However, others have not found an importance of the PT pore for the cytochrome c-releasing activity of Bax (14Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 17Finucane D.M.

It is not clear how this discrepancy may be resolved, although it may be related to different experimental conditions. Alternatively, Bax may work in either mode depending on the cellular environment. The ability of Bid to induce cytochrome c release has been suggested to be mediated by Bax, for Bid can facilitate the insertion of Bax into the mitochondrial membrane to form functional oligomers (27Desagher S. Osen-Sand A. Nichols A. Eskes R. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 891-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 28Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). If this is true, then the potential involvement of the PT pore in Bid-mediated cytochrome c release will also depend on how Bax will work under various conditions, although the availablein vitro evidence suggest that the PT pore is not involved (19Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 26Kluck R.M. Esposti M.D. Perkins G. Renken C. Kuwana T. Bossy-Wetzel E. Goldberg M. Allen T. Barber M.J. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). How Bid induces cytochrome c release, particularly under the physiological conditions, thus remains to be determined. In the present study, we decided to investigate Bid-dependent mechanisms under conditions that likely reflected the physiological environment where Bid was functional. Thus an in vitro reconstitution system was employed in which truncated Bid was incubated with mitochondria isolated from murine livers, components that are known to be physiologically relevant (23Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Both cytochrome c release and mitochondrial permeability transition were measured under the same experimental conditions to examine mechanistic relationships. Results obtained from these in vitro studies were further verified in both primary hepatocyte cultures and animal experiments after Bid-dependent death stimulation (23Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). We found that mitochondrial permeability transition was not induced by tBid and that classical PT pore inhibitors could not block cytochromec release induced by tBid. In addition, Bid-dependent hepatocyte apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibodies could be inhibited by caspase inhibitors but not by PT pore inhibitors. Furthermore, we found that Mg2+, a PT pore inhibitor, actually significantly enhanced the ability of tBid to induce cytochrome c release. By using liver mitochondria isolated from bax- or bid-deficient mouse, we also demonstrated that the ability of tBid or Bax to induce cytochromec release was not mutually dependent, although the two proteins could work synergistically. These data firmly indicate that Bid induces cytochrome c release independently of mitochondrial permeability transition pore and Bax. All recombinant proteins were expressed with a polyhistidine tag at the N termini using the pET23dwHis vector (a gift from Dr. Dai-Wu Seol, University of Pittsburgh), modified from the pET23d(+) vector (Novagen, WI).

The proteins were eluted with buffer containing 400 mmimidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, and were further purified using a Sephadex G-50 column balanced with phosphate-buffered saline. The purified proteins were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and quantified by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Livers of C57BL/6 wild-type, bid-deficient (23Yin X.M.

Mitochondria were kept on ice and used within 2 h of preparation. Fifteen micrograms of mitochondria (0.5 mg/ml) were incubated at 30 °C in 30 μl of Buffer B for 1 h with various reagents as indicated in the figure legends. The supernatants were then separated from the mitochondria by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using an anti-cytochromec antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) or a chicken anti-rat sulfite oxidase antibody (26Kluck R.M.

The blots were visualized by the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the detection of mitochondrial swelling, the mitochondria were suspended in Buffer B at 1 mg/ml (800 μg total) to which different chemicals were added as indicated in the figure legends. Light absorbance at A540 was measured at designated time points during the 60-min incubation period at 30 °C using a spectrophotometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec Plus).

To detect mitochondrial permeability transition in vitro, isolated mitochondria were first incubated in Buffer B with 5 μm Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 15 min at 30 °C. Mitochondria were washed with Buffer B three times to remove unloaded Calcein-AM and then treated with various reagents as indicated in the figure legends at 30 °C. Mitochondria were recovered after centrifugation at designated time points and resuspended in ice-cold water. The fluorescence intensity of the totally released calcein was measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B) at 488-nm excitation and 520-nm emission (18Pastorino J.G.

Data were standardized to the untreated control group at the time 0 point. To determine whether tBid has any effects on mitochondrial transmembrane potential, isolated murine liver mitochondria were first treated with tBid under various conditions as specified in the figure legends and then incubated with 40 nm3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6(3), Molecular Probes) for 10 min at 30 °C. The mitochondria were then washed and resuspended in 0.3 ml of Buffer B for flow cytometry analysis. Mitochondrial depolarization was induced by 50 μmprotonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, (Sigma) in control samples. Murine hepatocytes were isolated through a perfusion-based method as described previously (31Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5208) Google Scholar), with minor modification (32Klaunig J.E. Goldblatt P.J. Hinton D.E. Lipsky M.M. Chacko J. Trump B.F. In Vitro. 1981; 17: 913-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers of wild-type orbid-deficient mice were first perfused with a Ca2+, Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.5 mm EGTA for 10 min at a flow rate of 10 ml/min. Livers were then perfused with 100 ml of Lebowitz L15 solution containing 5 mmCaCl2 and 50 mg of collagenase H for 10 min at the rate of 10 ml/min. Livers were then harvested and dissected. After 3 low speed centrifugations at 600 rpm for 5 min, the parenchymal cells were resuspended in Williams medium E supplemented with 10% calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were plated on Falcon Primaria 24-well plates (Becton Dickinson, NJ) at a density of 8 × 104 cells/well and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were washed after 2–3 h of incubation and supplemented with fresh medium. Apoptosis was induced by an anti-Fas antibody (clone Jo-2, PharMingen) at a concentration of 0.5 μg/ml in the presence of cycloheximide (10 μg/ml). To determine the contribution of caspases or mitochondrial permeability transition to hepatocyte death, the following reagents were added simultaneously with the anti-Fas antibody: 50 μmbenzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone or DEVD aldehyde (Calbiochem), 10 μm cyclosporin A (Sigma), or 50 μm bongkrekic acid (Biomol, PA). Cell viability was determined 12 h later by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) assay as described (33Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3329) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stained with MTT at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with an extraction buffer (20% SDS in 50%N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 4.7) overnight at 37 °C, and absorbance at 550 nm was measured (Molecular Devices Kinetic Microplate Reader). Wild-type, bid-deficient (23Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar), orbax-deficient (29Knudson C.M. Tung K.S. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) mice were intravenously given anti-Fas antibodies (clone Jo-2, PharMingen) at the dose of 0.25 μg/g of body weight. Mice were sacrificed 4 h later, and a portion of the liver was fixed in 10% balanced formalin for paraffin embedding and hematoxylin-eosin staining. The major portion of the livers were homogenized in Buffer A, and the cytosolic fractions were isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. For Western blot analysis, 50 μg of cytosol were subject to 15% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotting with antibodies against Bid (34Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) or cytochromec (PharMingen). Caspase-3 activities in the cytosol (20 μg of protein) were evaluated by measuring the proteolytic cleavage of a synthetic fluorescent substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD aminofluoromethylcoumarin (50 μm) at 37 °C for 30 or 60 min (23Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Cleaved fluorescence products were measured at 400-nm excitation and 505-nm emission using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B). To explore the mechanism by which tBid induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria, we generated recombinant full-length murine Bid (amino acids 1–195), tBid (amino acids 60–195), and mutant tBid (G94E) tagged with 6 histidines at the N terminus. Proteins were purified to homogeneity by His-Bind resin affinity column and confirmed by Western blot with an anti-Bid antibody (34Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). When incubated with isolated murine liver mitochondria, both full-length Bid and tBid induced cytochrome c release (Fig. 1 B). However, tBid was much more potent. At the concentration tested, the amount of released cytochrome c in the presence of 87 nm(60 ng/30 μl) of full-length Bid was only a small fraction of that released by 6.7 nm (3 ng/30 μl) of tBid. A mutation in the BH3 domain (G94E) abolished the activity of tBid to release cytochrome c from mitochondria (Fig. 1 B), consistent with a previous report (20Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3068) Google Scholar). The Gly-94 residue is known to be important for the pro-apoptotic activities of Bid (34Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Notably, under the conditions tested, sulfite oxidase, another mitochondrial inter-membrane protein with a molecular mass of 104 kDa (a dimer of 52-kDa subunits) was also released, suggesting that the effect of tBid was not specific to cytochrome c (Fig. 1 C). A number of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins other than Bid possess the ability to induce cytochrome c release (14Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). We thus sought to determine whether these ions are important to the cytochrome c-releasing activity of tBid. In all the experiments performed, we used Buffer B as the basic reaction buffer for both cytochrome c-releasing and mitochondrial permeability assays, which does not contain exogenous calcium but does contain 25 μm EGTA to prevent spontaneous mitochondrial swelling caused by trace amounts of Ca2+ in the solution. Under this condition and when there was no exogenous Mg2+ added, tBid was still able to induce cytochrome c release in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that neither Ca2+ nor Mg2+ is absolutely required for the activity of tBid. However, Mg2+ (4 mm) significantly enhanced the ability of tBid to induce cytochromec release (Fig. 2 A), so that even a low dose of tBid (1 ng/30 μl) achieved the maximal effect of releasing more than 95% of cytochrome c (Fig. 2 B). In fact, under this condition, as little as 0.22 nm (0.1 ng/30 μl) tBid was able to induce detectable levels of cytochrome c release from mitochondria (see Fig. 8). A lower dose of 1 mmMgCl2 was also effective in our experiments (data not shown). To determine whether other cations may have the similar effect, we added KCl at various concentrations to the reaction mixture. We found that K+ did not enhance the release of cytochromec induced by tBid at a concentration of 4 or 10 mm but could do so at 40 mm or higher (Fig. 2 C). Similar observations were made when NaCl was used (data not shown). It is possible that these cations may exert their effects in a similar fashion.Figure 8The induction of cytochrome crelease by Bax is not dependent on but can be enhanced by tBid. A, mitochondria isolated from wild-type (WT) or bid-deficient mouse livers were incubated with Bax-ΔTM (3 μm) in Buffer B. Cytochromec release was determined by Western blotting using the anti-cytochrome c antibody. B, liver mitochondria isolated from wild-type mice were incubated with BaxΔTM and/or tBid at the designated amounts in Buffer B with 4 mmMgCl2. Released cytochrome c was detected in supernatants by Western blot. The densitometric measurement was performed, and the density relative to the blank control was indicated at the bottom of the gel.View Large"
https://openalex.org/W2321452523,"Mitochondria play an essential role in apoptosis by releasing apoptogenic molecules such as cytochrome c and AIF, and some caspases, which are all regulated by Bcl-2 family proteins. Pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak have been shown to induce cytochrome c release and loss of membrane potential (Deltapsi) leading to AIF release in the isolated mitochondria. We have previously shown that Bax and Bak open the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) allowing cytochrome c to pass through the channel, and Bcl-xL closes the channel. However, it has been reported that it is adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) with which Bax/Bcl-xL interacts that modulate the channel activity. Here, we investigated the role of ANT and VDAC in the changes of isolated mitochondria triggered by Bax and by chemicals that induce permeability transition (PT). In rat and yeast mitochondria, Bax did not affect the ADP/ATP exchange activity of ANT. VDAC-deficient but not ANT-deficient yeast mitochondria showed resistance to cytochrome c release, Deltapsi loss, and swelling caused by Bax and PT inducers. Bcl-xL showed similar inhibition of all these changes in ANT-deficient and wild type yeast mitochondria. Furthermore, Bax induces cytochrome c release in wild type yeast cells but not VDAC1-deficient yeast cells. These data indicate that VDAC, but not ANT, is essential for apoptotic mitochondrial changes. The data also indicate that Bcl-xL and Bax possess an ability to regulate mitochondrial membrane permeability independently of other Bcl-2 family members."

We demonstrate that wild-type EWS protein functions as an adapter molecule coupling transcription to RNA splicing by binding to hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II through the N-terminal domain of EWS and recruiting serine-arginine (SR) splicing factors through the C-terminal domain of EWS. The oncogenic EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein retains the ability to bind to hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II but lacks the ability to recruit SR proteins because of replacement of the C-terminal domain of EWS by Fli-1.

In EWS fusion proteins, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of EWS is retained, whereas the C-terminal domain (CTD) of EWS is replaced by the corresponding fusion partner. Understanding the mechanism of transformation by EWS fusion proteins will probably require knowledge regarding the functions of the wild-type proteins. In this regard, the N-terminal domain of EWS is rich in glutamine, serine, and tyrosine, residues that are commonly found in transcriptional activation domains. EWS is known to associate with a specific subpopulation of the TFIID basal transcription factor and with certain subunits of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) complex (12Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). However, the C-terminal domains of EWS contain ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence and multiple arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) repeats, both of which are signatures of RNA-binding proteins (13Ohno T. Ouchida M. Lee L. Gatalica Z. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3087-3097PubMed Google Scholar). The Ewing's sarcoma protein EWS (1Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5022-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) comprise a unique family of proteins with shared structural features. We previously reported that wild-type TLS not only binds to RNA Pol II, but it also interacts with two newly characterized serine-arginine (SR) splicing factors (17Yang L. Embree L.J. Tsai S. Hickstein D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27761-27764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 18Yang L. Embree L.J. Hickstein D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3345-3354Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The structural similarities between EWS and TLS led to an assessment of the interaction of EWS with RNA Pol II and these TLS-associated SR (TASR) splicing factors. We determined that both EWS and EWS·Fli-1 interact with the hyperphosphorylated largest subunit of the RNA Pol II complex (Pol IIo) through the N-terminal domain of EWS. However, EWS interacts with TASR proteins, whereas EWS·Fli-1 is unable to interact with TASR proteins because of replacement of its C-terminal domain by the Fli-1 fusion partner. These biochemical differences between EWS and EWS·Fli-1 have functional consequences because EWS·Fli-1 interferes with TASR-mediated splicing in an in vivo E1A splicing assay. These results suggest that the EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein may contribute to cellular transformation through an effect on the coupling of transcription to RNA splicing. The cDNAs for EWS, EWS·Fli-1, and Fli-1 were cloned into the pSG5-FL vector with the Flag epitope at the N-terminal end. The EWS-NTD deletion mutant consists of amino acids 1–245 of the EWS protein, and the EWS-CTD deletion mutant contains amino acids 267–656 of the EWS protein. Myc-TASR-1 and -2 expression vectors were constructed by cloning full-length TASR cDNAs into pCS2-MT vector (Sigma) with the Myc epitope at the N-terminal end. For in vivo splicing assay, TASR cDNAs were inserted into pMH vector (Sigma) to generate pMH-TASR with one copy of the influenza hemagglutinin epitope at the C-terminal ends of TASR proteins. Reporter plasmid pCS3-MT-E1A was a kind gift from Dr. Moreau-Gachelin (19Hallier M. Lerga A. Barnache S. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4838-4842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For expression of Flag- or Myc-tagged proteins, 10 μg of the pSG5-Flag expression construct and 10 μg of the pCS2-Myc expression construct were introduced into 3 × 106 COS-7 cells by electroporation. 48 h after electroporation, the cells were lysed with 0.6 ml of lysis buffer A (10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100). Prior to cell lysis, 3 μl of 9E10 mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (Sigma) or 10 μl of 8WG16 mouse monoclonal anti-RNA Pol II antibody (Research Diagnostics, Inc.) was incubated with 30 μl of protein A/G plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 50 min at 4 °C in 0.3 ml of buffer A, and the antibody-protein A/G-agarose complex was then incubated with 0.2 ml of fresh cell lysate for 20 min. After four washes with radioimmune precipitation buffer, the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 10% gel, and the proteins were detected with M2 mouse monoclonal anti-Flag antibody (Sigma), the anti-Myc antibody, or C-21 rabbit polyclonal anti-RNA Pol II antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoprecipitation of endogenous EWS and EWS·Fli-1 fusion proteins, 30 μl of protein A/G plus agarose was pre-charged with 10 μl of 8WG16 anti-Pol II or control mouse IgG and then incubated with 0.2 ml of fresh lysate from HeLa, SK-ES, or RD-ES cells as described above. The immunoprecipitates were blotted with N-18 rabbit polyclonal anti-EWS (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and C119 rabbit polyclonal anti-Fli-1 (20Kwiatkowski B.A. Bastian L.S. Bauer Jr., T.R. Tsai S.

Protein bands were visualized using the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation of hyperphosphorylated RNA Pol IIo, 15 μl of mouse monoclonal H5 or H14 antibody (Research Diagnostics, Inc.) was coupled to 40 μl of protein A/G plus agarose beads via 30 μl of rabbit anti-mouse IgM (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). For co-immunoprecipitation of EWS-associated RNA Pol IIo, 30 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-EWS antibodies or goat polyclonal anti-Flag antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was first bound to 40 μl of protein A/G plus agarose beads. HeLa cells from a 100-mm dish were lysed with 0.6 ml of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate). Insoluble material was removed via centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 5 min, and the immunoprecipitation was then carried out by incubating 0.2 ml of lysate with antibody pre-charged agarose beads at 4 °C for 4 h. After being washed three times with ice-cold cell lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 6% gel. The hypophosphorylated RNA Pol IIa was detected with the 8WG16 antibody, and the hyperphosphorylated RNA Pol IIo was detected with the H14 antibody as described previously (21Bregman D.B. Du L. van der Zee S. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). For in vivo splicing of E1A pre-mRNA, 2 μg of pCS3-MT-E1A and 2 μg of pMH-TASR plus 6 μg of pSG5-Flag construct were mixed with 60 μl of DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the DNA-DOTAP mixture was added to two 60-mm duplicate dishes with 65% confluent HeLa cells. 40 h after transfection, cells from one dish were lysed with 0.25 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer for Western blotting, and cells from the other dish were used for RNA isolation with an RNeasy column (Qiagen). To ensure adequate annealing, one-fifth of the total RNA was hybridized to 20 pmol of T7 primer overnight. The reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out with 200 units of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 1 h, terminated by heat inactivation at 80 °C, and diluted to a final volume of 40 μl containing 0.5 unit of RNase H. For PCR amplification of E1A splicing isoforms, 4 μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction mixture was used as the DNA template in a 50-μl reaction with RR67 (5′GAGCTTGGGCGACCTCA3′) and T7 (5′AATACGACTCACTATAG3′) as the primer pair. The PCR was carried out by a 2-min incubation at 94 °C, then 20 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 72 °C followed by a final extension of 7 min at 72 °C. In RNase protection assay, one-fifth of the total RNA was hybridized to 1 × 106 cpm of32P-labeled antisense E1A RNA probe (covering bases 499–1316 of the E1A gene). After overnight hybridization, excessive RNA probe was digested with a mixture of RNase A + T1 (PharMingen RNase protection assay system) at 30 °C for 1 h, and the protected antisense E1A RNA fragments were isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. After separation on a 6% QuickPoint pre-cast gel (Novex), the protected antisense RNA fragments were visualized by exposure to x-ray films. To investigate the in vivo interaction between EWS and the TASR proteins, plasmids expressing Flag-tagged EWS, EWS·Fli-1, and Fli-1 were constructed (Fig. 1 a) and co-transfected into COS-7 cells with plasmids expressing Myc-tagged TASR-1 and TASR-2. The Flag-tagged EWS, EWS·Fli-1, Fli-1, and Myc-tagged TASR-1 and TASR-2 proteins were expressed in transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 1 b, lanes 1–6). Lysates from the co-transfected cells were then used in immunoprecipitation experiments. In immunoprecipitates brought down using the anti-Myc antibody, Flag-EWS co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-TASR-1 and Myc-TASR-2 (Fig. 1 b, lanes 7 and 10), whereas Flag-EWS·Fli-1 and Flag-Fli-1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with either TASR protein (Fig. 1 b, lanes 8,9, 11, and 12). Because the C-terminal domain of EWS is replaced by the Fli-1 sequence in the EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein, these results suggested that wild-type EWS might mediate interaction with the TASR proteins through its C-terminal domain. To test this possibility, the N-terminal domain of EWS (EWS-NTD) and the C-terminal domain of EWS (EWS-CTD) were cloned separately into the pSG5-FL expression vector for transfection (Fig.1 a). When expressed in COS-7 cells, Flag-EWS-CTD co-immunoprecipitated with both TASR proteins (Fig. 1 c,lanes 9 and 12), whereas the Flag-EWS-NTD did not, demonstrating that EWS interacts with TASR-1 and -2 through the C-terminal domain of EWS. EWS, as well as the structurally related TLS and TAFII68 proteins, has been shown to associate with TFIID and subunits of the RNA Pol II complex (12Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 16Bertolotti A. Lutz Y. Heard D.J. Chambon P. Tora L.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); however, EWS·Fli-1 has been reported to lack this ability to interact with RNA Pol II (12Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Because RNA Pol II is known to couple gene transcription with RNA processingin vivo (23Bentley D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), the demonstration that the C-terminal domain of EWS binds to SR proteins raised the possibility that EWS might function as an adapter molecule recruiting SR splicing factors to the site of active gene transcription by RNA Pol II. To assess the interaction between RNA Pol II, EWS, and EWS·Fli-1, immunoprecipitation studies were carried out using a mouse monoclonal 8WG16 antibody recognizing the C-terminal heptapeptide repeat on the largest subunit of RNA Pol II. Western blotting of immunoprecipitates from COS-7 cells using an anti-Flag antibody demonstrated that both Flag-EWS and Flag-EWS·Fli-1, but not Flag-Fli-1, were present in the immunocomplexes with RNA Pol II (Fig.2 a, lanes 4–6). Using deletion mutants of EWS, Flag-EWS-NTD but not Flag-EWS-CTD was demonstrated to be the domain responsible for association with RNA Pol II (Fig. 2 b, lanes 10–12). To determine whether endogenous EWS·Fli-1 associated with RNA Pol II in Ewing's sarcoma cells, we used the same 8WG16 anti-Pol II antibody in co-immunoprecipitation experiments with lysate from HeLa cells, which lack the EWS·FLI-1 fusion protein, and with lysates from two Ewing's sarcoma cell lines, SK-ES and RD-ES, which are known to express the 68-kDa EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated and blotted with antibodies recognizing EWS and EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein. The anti-EWS antibody recognized the 90-kDa EWS protein in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 c, lanes 13–18, upper panel), and the anti-Fli-1 antibody detected the 68-kDa EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein in the immunoprecipitates from the two Ewing's sarcoma cell lines but not from the HeLa cells (Fig. 2 c, lanes 13–18,lower panel). These results indicated that both endogenous EWS and EWS·Fli-1 are associated with RNA Pol II in vivo. The largest subunit of RNA Pol II can exist either as a hypophosphorylated form (Pol IIa) that migrates at 220 kDa or as a hyperphosphorylated form (Pol IIo) that migrates at 240 kDa. The phosphorylation sites on this largest Pol II subunit have been localized to the C-terminal domain. Hypophosphorylated RNA Pol IIa is believed to be recruited to pre-initiation complexes. Concomitant with initiation of transcription, the CTD of Pol IIa becomes phosphorylated, and elongating polymerase therefore has a hyperphosphorylated CTD (24Conaway J.W. Shilatifard A. Dvir A. Conaway R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 375-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Because RNA processing takes place along with transcriptional elongation, RNA splicing factors are associated with hyperphosphorylated Pol IIo (25Mortillaro M.J. Blencowe B.J. Wei X. Nakayasu H. Du L. Warren S.L. Sharp P.A. Berezney R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8253-8257Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 26Kim E. Du L. Bregman D.B. Warren S.L. J.

If EWS indeed functions as an adapter molecule that recruits SR splicing factors to the site of transcription, EWS would be expected to interact with hyperphosphorylated Pol IIo. In this study, three mouse monoclonal anti-Pol II antibodies (8WG16, H5, and H14) were used in immunoprecipitation and Western blotting to differentiate the phosphorylation status of the Pol II subpopulations associated with EWS and EWS·Fli-1. Initial experiments confirmed previous observations that 8WG16 recognizes both hypophosphorylated Pol IIa and hyperphosphorylated Pol IIo in immunoprecipitation studies (21Bregman D.B. Du L. van der Zee S. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 26Kim E. Du L. Bregman D.B. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar); however, 8WG16 primarily detects the hypophosphorylated Pol IIa form in Western blotting (Fig.3 a, lane 2,upper and lower panels). The H5 and H14 antibodies recognize only the hyperphosphorylated Pol IIo form in both immunoprecipitation and Western blotting (21Bregman D.B. Du L. van der Zee S. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 a,lanes 3 and 4). Repeated attempts to co-immunoprecipitate EWS with H5 and H14 were not successful (data not shown), and it is likely that binding by H5 or H14 causes Pol IIo to be released from the multi-protein complex as previously suggested (26Kim E. Du L. Bregman D.B. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). As an alternative approach, RNA Pol II was co-immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the C terminus of EWS, whereas a rabbit polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of EWS failed to co-immunoprecipitate RNA Pol II (Fig. 3 a, lanes 6and 7). This different ability to co-immunoprecipitate RNA Pol II suggests that the rabbit antibody against the C terminus of EWS is less disruptive to the maintenance of the EWS-Pol II multi-protein complex than is the antibody against the N terminus of EWS. The RNA Pol II subpopulation associated with EWS appeared to be predominantly the hyperphosphorylated Pol IIo form because the co-immunoprecipitated RNA Pol II is detectable by H14 but not by 8WG16 in Western blotting (Fig.3 a, lane 6, upper and lower panels). To co-immunoprecipitate RNA Pol II with the EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein, plasmids expressing Flag-tagged EWS, EWS·Fli-1, and Fli-1 were transfected into HeLa cells, and the lysates were used in co-immunoprecipitation with a goat polyclonal anti-Flag antibody. Under our experimental conditions, only Flag-EWS·Fli-1 co-immunoprecipitated with hyperphosphorylated Pol IIo (Fig.3 b, lane 10), whereas Flag-EWS and Flag-Fli-1 did not co-immunoprecipitate with Pol IIo (Fig. 3 b, lanes 9 and 11). Because the Flag epitope is tagged at the same N-terminal ends of EWS and EWS·Fli-1 and because the immunoprecipitation was carried out with the same goat anti-Flag, these results suggested that EWS and EWS·Fli-1 might associate differently with RNA Pol IIo. The EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein may have a higher affinity than EWS toward the same site on Pol IIo, and this high affinity may preserve the interaction between Pol IIo and EWS·Fli-1 despite interference by the anti-Flag antibody binding. Another potential explanation is that EWS·Fli-1 may bind to a different site on Pol IIo that is less prone to disruption by the antibody. To investigate whether this interaction of EWS with RNA Pol IIo and the TASR proteins played a role in RNA splicing, we tested both wild-type EWS and the EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein in an E1A splicing assay in HeLa cells. The alternative splicing of E1A pre-mRNA in HeLa cells results in the generation of five different splicing isoforms designated 13 S, 12 S, 11 S, 10 S, and 9 S (Fig.4 a) (28Wang J. Manley J.L. RNA (N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 335-346PubMed Google Scholar), and co-expression of individual SR proteins is known to alter the splicing pattern of E1A isoforms (29Caceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Analysis of E1A splicing products by RT-PCR indicated that expression of TASR-1 promoted splicing to the 11 S-, 10 S-, and 9 S-isoforms (Fig.4 b; compare lanes a and e), whereas expression of TASR-2 promoted splicing to the 9 S-isoform (Fig.4 b, compare lanes a and i). Endogenous EWS is constitutively expressed in HeLa cells, and co-expression of EWS did not alter the E1A splicing profile (Fig. 4 b, lanes f and j). Co-expression of EWS·Fli-1 resulted in a marked inhibition of E1A splicing by both TASR-1 and TASR-2 (Fig.4 b, compare lane f with lane g, andlane j with lane k); however, co-expression of Fli-1 had little effect on E1A splicing (Fig. 4 b,lanes h and l). The band designated “reporter DNA” represents the PCR-amplified E1A genomic sequence from residual plasmid DNA. To demonstrate that the results obtained by RT-PCR were not due to selective amplification of specific sequences, we developed an RNase protection assay to directly measure the profile of E1A alternative splicing in HeLa cells. In the RNase protection assay, TASR-1 expression increased the E1A fragments corresponding to the 11 S-, 10 S-, and 9 S-isoforms (Fig. 4 c, compare lanes aand e), whereas TASR-2 expression increased the E1A fragments to the 9 S-isoform (Fig. 4 c, compare lanes a and i). Co-expression of Flag-EWS and Flag-Fli-1 did not significantly alter TASR-mediated E1A pre-mRNA splicing (Fig.4 c, lanes f, h, j, andl); however, co-expression of Flag-EWS·Fli-1 strongly inhibited E1A pre-mRNA splicing mediated by both TASR proteins (Fig. 4 c, lanes g and k). Transfection efficiency among different samples was similar in that comparable levels of EWS, EWS·Fli-1, Fli-1, and TASR proteins were expressed in the transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 4 c, bottom panels). Unspliced E1A pre-mRNA was not detected by the RNase protection assay, consistent with previous reports that the unprocessed E1A pre-mRNA molecule is unstable in HeLa cells (28Wang J. Manley J.L. RNA (N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 335-346PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of EWS deletion mutants on TASR-mediated E1A splicing were tested to determine whether the N-terminal domain or the C-terminal domain of EWS alone was responsible for the alteration in E1A splicing. Even though in HeLa cells both EWS deletion mutants were expressed at levels comparable with EWS·Fli-1, neither the EWS-NTD nor the EWS-CTD inhibited TASR-mediated E1A pre-mRNA splicing (Fig. 4 d,lanes m–r), indicating that inclusion of Fli-1 in the fusion protein is necessary for EWS·Fli-1 inhibition of RNA splicing. Inclusion of the Fli-1 sequence in the fusion protein may result in changes in protein folding and/or accessibility of the EWS N-terminal domain to RNA Pol II, thus endowing the EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein with a higher affinity toward certain subunits of RNA Pol II such as hsRPB7 (22Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This might enable the fusion protein to associate preferentially with the RNA Pol II complex, resulting in a dominant-negative effect on RNA splicing. Although these results are consistent with the hypothesis that EWS·Fli-1 uncouples E1A reporter gene transcription from E1A pre-mRNA splicing and leads to degradation of the unprocessed E1A pre-mRNA transcripts in HeLa cells, the observed decrease in E1A splicing products could also be explained by EWS·Fli-1 inhibition of transcription from the pCS3-MT-E1A reporter or by EWS·Fli-1-induced degradation of the E1A splicing products. To test whether EWS·Fli-1 suppresses transcription from the pCS3-MT-E1A reporter or destabilizes the E1A splicing isoforms, we constructed an additional reporter plasmid, pCS3-MT-E1A-9S, which was generated from the same vector as pCS3-MT-E1A but contains a cDNA insert corresponding to the 9S.E.1A splicing isoform. The 9S.E.1A isoform is devoid of intron sequence; therefore its expression should be controlled primarily by gene transcription rather than by splicing. When analyzed in HeLa cells under the same conditions as described above, the resultant 9S.E.1A mRNA levels were not decreased by co-expression of EWS·Fli-1 or altered by TASR-1 or TASR-2 (Fig. 5). These results indicate that EWS·Fli-1 does not suppress transcription from the pCS3-MT-E1A vector or selectively destabilize the 9S.E.1A splicing isoform. Thus, the decrease in the steady-state level of E1A transcripts most likely results from EWS·Fli-1 inhibition of TASR-mediated splicing. The EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein has been known to bind to specific DNA sequences and to transactivate target genes with Fli-1 binding sites in their promoter regions (30Bailly R.A. Bosselut R. Zucman J.

Genet. 1999; 23: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Because deletion of either the EWS or the Fli-1 domain in the fusion protein results in loss of transforming ability (34May W.A. Gishizky M.L. Lessnick S.L. Lunsford L.B. Lewis B.C. Delattre O. Zucman J. Thomas G. Denny C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5752-5756Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), the EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein is believed to lead to malignant transformation via inappropriate activation of Fli-1 target genes (35Braun B.S. Frieden R. Lessnick S.L. May W.A. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4623-4630Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, increasing evidence suggests that an alternative mechanism may also be involved in transformation by EWS·Fli-1. First, although EWS·Fli-1 is a more potent transactivator than Fli-1, deletional studies indicate that the domain within EWS required for transactivation differs from the domain required for transformation (36Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Denny C.T. May W.A. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar). Second, a recent mutagenesis study demonstrated that a point mutation abolishing the DNA binding activity of EWS·Fli-1 did not abolish its transforming ability (37Jaishankar S. Zhang J. Roussel M.F. Baker S.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5592-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Third, the N-terminal domain of EWS has been reported to interact with splicing factors SF1 (38Zhang D. Paley A.J. Childs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18086-18091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and U1C (39Knoop L.L. Baker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24865-24871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to regulate gene expression. Fourth, the RNA binding motifs in the C-terminal domain of EWS are replaced in the EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein, thus implicating a potential loss of function in RNA processing by the fusion protein. Our findings provide evidence for a pathway whereby wild-type EWS functions as a docking molecule that binds via its N-terminal domain to hyperphosphorylated RNA Pol IIo and recruits specific SR splicing factors through its C-terminal domain. EWS fusion proteins, on the other hand, bind to RNA Pol IIo but fail to recruit TASR splicing factors. This uncoupling of RNA processing from transcription would be expected to alter gene expression in tumor cells with EWS fusions. EWS fusion proteins might block splicing by SR proteins, leading to degradation of the unprocessed target pre-mRNA and down-regulation of target gene expression, or lead to alternative splicing of the target pre-mRNA. In this regard, abnormal RNA splicing in Ewing's sarcoma cells has been reported to affect a variety of molecules such as the fragile histidine triad (FHIT) tumor suppressor (40Hinohara S. Satake N. Sekine K. Kaneko Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1998; 89: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the p53-inducible P2XM ion channel (41Nawa G. Miyoshi Y. Yoshikawa H. Ochi T. Nakamura Y. Br. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 1185-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the PAX3 and PAX7 regulators of myogenic and neural development (42Barr F.G. Fitzgerald J.C. Ginsberg J.P. Vanella M.L. Davis R.J. Bennicelli J.L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5443-5448PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings also demonstrate that the EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein interferes with E1A pre-mRNA splicing despite the presence of endogenous EWS protein. These results appear to be relevant to the pathogenesis of Ewing's sarcoma because in Ewing's sarcoma cells one EWS allele remains intact (43May W.A. Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Klemsz M. Lewis B.C. Lunsford L.B. Hromas R. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7393-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In our splicing assays the EWS fusion protein functions in a dominant-negative manner. This dominant-negative effect could be partly explained by the fact that EWS·Fli-1 is present exclusively in the nucleus, whereas EWS is detectable in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (43May W.A. Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Klemsz M. Lewis B.C. Lunsford L.B. Hromas R. Denny C.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7393-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The exclusive nuclear localization of the EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein in effect increases the nuclear concentration of the EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein and enhances its chance to compete with EWS for interaction with the RNA Pol II complex. Alternatively, EWS and EWS·Fli-1 may each associate with different subunits of the RNA Pol II complex, and these associations may be mutually exclusive. This notion is supported by the findings that nuclear complexes containing EWS and EWS·Fli-1 have different sedimentation profiles when fractionated through a glycerol gradient (12Bertolotti A. Melot T. Acker J. Vigneron M. Delattre O. Tora L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and that the EWS·Fli-1 fusion protein possesses a much higher affinity toward certain subunits of the RNA Pol II complex than does wild-type EWS, as shown in this study and by others (22Petermann R. Mossier B.M. Aryee D.N. Khazak V. Golemis E.A. Kovar H. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It is also possible that high affinity binding to certain subunits of RNA Pol II by EWS·Fli-1 dominant-negatively affects the recruitment of SR splicing factors by EWS to RNA Pol II, leading to disruption of normal splicing mediated by these EWS-associated SR proteins. The role of competition between EWS and EWS·Fli-1 will be investigated in future studies using inducible expression of EWS in Ewing's sarcoma cell lines."

Because errors in mtDNA lead to erroneous translation of important subunits of the electron transport chain, the result can be a deficiency in the production of ATP along with the “leak” of electrons from the various protein complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. These electrons cause damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA through formation of intermediate reactive oxygen species. As more damage is sustained, the mitochondria become more dysfunctional, and a self-propagating detrimental cycle ultimately ensues. Finally, if and when sufficient damage is produced, an apoptotic program can be initiated in the affected cell, or the cell may die by necrosis (13Papa S. Skulachev V.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 18Singh K.K. Russell J. Sigala B. Zhang Y. Williams J. Keshav K.F.

Mitochondrial DNA is particularly susceptible to damage by reactive oxygen species because of its close proximity to the electron transport chain and its lack of protective histones.

Oxidative damage to mtDNA can be repaired efficiently by some cell types (24LeDoux S.P. Driggers W.J. Hollensworth B.S. Wilson G.L. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Driggers W.J. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol.

Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 27LeDoux S.P. Shen C.C. Grishko V.I. Fields P.A. Gard A.L. Wilson G.L. Glia. 1998; 24: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) are much less proficient at repairing this damage. To date, the mechanisms involved in this repair have not been well defined. Since the discovery of mammalian 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG) (28Rosenquist T.A. Zharkov D.O. Grollman A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7429-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), variant splices of OGG, MYH (the human homologue of Escherichia coli MutY, which excises mispaired adenine opposite 8-oxoguanine), and NTH1 (the human homologue ofE. coli endonuclease III) have been localized to mitochondria (29Takao M. Aburatani H. Kobayashi K. Yasui A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2917-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Recent evidence shows that there is an increase in the level of 8-oxoguanine lesions in mtDNA with age (16Hudson E.K. Hogue B.A. Souza-Pinto N.C. Croteau D.L. Anson R.M. Bohr V.A. Hansford R.G. Free Radic. Res. 1998; 29: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Another study shows that there is an age-associated increase specifically in OGG activity in mitochondria and not in other repair enzymes (30Souza-Pinto N.C. Croteau D.L. Hudson E.K. Hansford R.G. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1935-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that the DNA repair system in mitochondria may be differentially regulated and that the OGG enzyme may play a pivotal role in this regulation. However, much remains to be learned about the components and processes involved in mtDNA repair of oxidative damage. A plausible explanation for why various cell types possess different inherent capacities for repairing mtDNA (24LeDoux S.P. Driggers W.J. Hollensworth B.S. Wilson G.L. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 25Driggers W.J. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22042-22045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shen C.C. Wertelecki W. Driggers W.J. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Mutat.

Glia. 1998; 24: 304-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) is that there are differences in the expression of specific components involved in DNA repair. To explore this possibility, we sought to increase the DNA repair capacity of a cell line that we have found to be relatively inefficient at repairing oxidative damage to its mtDNA. Because 8-oxoguanine has been considered to be one of the most mutagenic of oxidative lesions in DNA due to its strong tendency to mispair with adenine (31Bjoras M. Luna L. Johnsen B. Hoff E. Haug T. Rognes T. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6314-6322Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), we targeted the glycosylase/AP lyase that repairs this lesion in the nucleus of human cells, hOGG, to the mitochondria. We investigated the effect of the targeted recombinant protein on mtDNA repair, cell survival, and the ability to proliferate. The results indicate that this protein enhances the repair of oxidative damage to mtDNA and increases the capacity for cells to survive and continue to divide after an oxidative insult. HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.); supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories), 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma), and 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C; and passaged every 3–4 days. For transfections, cells were grown in 75-cm2 flasks until they reached 75% confluence. They were then transfected with Fugene 6 reagent (Roche, Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After 24 h, selection with 0.6 mg/ml G418 (Geneticin) ensued. After 2 weeks of selection, the cells were maintained in 0.4 mg/ml G418. Oligonucleotides were designed to serve as primers to amplify OGG1 from a cDNA plasmid. Additionally, the 5′ primer, GGAATTCATGTTGAGCCGGGCAGTGTGCGGCACCAGCAGGCAGCTGGCTCCGGCTTTGGGGTATCTGGGCTCCAGGCAGATGCCTGAATTACCCGAAGTT, contained the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS from MnSOD; Ref. 32Shimoda-Matsubayashi S. Matsumine H. Kobayashi T. Nakagawa- Hattori Y. Shimizu Y. Mizuno Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 226: 561-565Google Scholar) and an EcoRI restriction site, and the 3′ primer, CGCCGCTCGAGGCCTTCCGGCCCTTTGGA, contained an XhoI restriction site. The cDNA was amplified using a high-fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase by PCR in a thermal cycler under the following conditions: 30-s denaturation (94° C), 1-min annealing (55° C), and 2-min extension (72° C). The resulting PCR fragment consisted of an EcoRI site, the MTS, the OGG coding region, and an XhoI site. The PCR product was subjected to double restriction enzyme digestion with EcoRI andXhoI overnight at 37 °C. The restriction fragment was subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.0neo and sequenced to confirm fidelity. The predicted protein is approximately 39 kDa. Three 75-cm2flasks of each cell type (MTS-OGG- and control vector-transfected cells) at confluence were harvested and treated with ice-cold digitonin (325 mm digitonin, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm mannitol, and 17 mm4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid, pH 7.4) for 80 s. The lysed cells were then added to mannitol-sucrose buffer for a final strength of 1× (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The ice-cold suspension was then centrifuged for 10 min at 800 ×g to pellet nuclei. The supernatant was saved, the pelleted material was resuspended in 1× mannitol-sucrose buffer, and centrifugation was repeated. This was repeated three more times. The combined supernatants were then centrifuged to pellet any remaining nuclei, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g to pellet mitochondria. The combined supernatants were concentrated (Amicon protein concentrators) for cytosolic fractions. Isolated mitochondria and nuclei were suspended in a buffer of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 300 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol. These preparations were briefly sonicated on ice, and 5 μl of protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma (for mammalian cell extracts, 100 mm AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride), 4 mm bestatin, 1.4 mm E 64, 2.2 mm leupeptin, 1.5 mm pepstatin, and 80 μm aprotinin) was added per milliliter of buffer. The fractions were centrifuged once more at 5,000 × g to pellet any remaining cell debris, and supernatant protein was used for Western blots and OGG activity assays. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein dye micro-assay according to manufacturer's recommendations (Bradford method). The organelle-enriched fractions from each cell type were lysed and quantitated as described above. Fifty μg of each sample was loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed to resolve proteins. The proteins were then transferred to Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes (Millipore) and blocked in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, and 6% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-hOGG primary antibody, which was kindly provided by Dr. Sankar Mitra (University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX), overnight at 4 °C in the same solution. The membrane was then washed four times in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 and two times in the same solution without Tween 20. The horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody was incubated with the membrane for 4 h at 4 °C, the washes were repeated as described above, and the membrane was reacted with chemiluminescent reagents (SuperSignal; Pierce) and processed for autoradiography. Monoclonal cytochromec antibody was purchased from PharMingen, and blotting procedures were performed as described above with anti-mouse secondary antibody. A 24-mer oligonucleotide with 8-oxoguanine at the 10th position (Trevigen) was end-labeled. An identical 24-mer without 8-oxoguanine also was used in parallel reactions. The labeling reaction contained 5 pmol of single-strand 8-oxoguanine oligonucleotide, 5 pmol of γ-32P, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and appropriate kinase buffer in a total volume of 20 μl (37 °C for 30 min, 90 °C for 2 min). Complementary oligonucleotide (also 5 pmol) was then added to form duplex DNA. Equal amounts of protein from the fractions isolated from both cell types were then used in assays with labeled duplex oligonucleotide. Activity assays contained 0.2 pmol of labeled duplex oligonucleotide, 3 μl of 10× REC buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m KCl, 100 mm EDTA, and 1 mg/ml BSA), and organelle extracts or control formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase enzyme in a total volume of 30 μl (37 °C for 1 h). Organelle extracts contributed less than 20% of the total reaction volume (50 μg of mitochondrial, 20 μg of nuclear, and 50 μg of cytosolic protein). Bromphenol blue dye was added, and the reaction contents were resolved on 20% acrylamide, 8 m urea gels in 1× Tris-borate EDTA. Menadione (Sigma), a redox cycler (33Thor H. Smith M.T. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Jewell S.A. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12419-12425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Frei B. Winterhalter K.H. Richter C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4438-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), was dissolved in Eagle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salts only (no serum) at a concentration of 400 μm for DNA repair studies. This was applied to MTS-OGG-transfected and control-transfected cells at approximately 75% confluence in 60-mm culture plates for 1 h in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were lysed immediately (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.3 mg/ml proteinase K), or regular growth media was replaced, and repair time was allowed in the incubator before lysis of cells. Control cultures were exposed to drug diluent only. Lower doses of menadione were used in clonogenic assays due to higher sensitivity of sparsely plated cells. Cell lysates from the treatment described above were incubated overnight at 37 °C, 0.2 volume of 5m NaCl was added, and high molecular weight DNA was extracted with equal volumes of chloroform three times, followed by precipitation with ammonium acetate and ethanol. DNA was then resuspended in distilled H2O, treated with RNase (final concentration, 1 mg/ml) for 2 h, and digested withXhoI overnight at 37 °C. Digested samples were precipitated, resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), and precisely quantified using a Hoefer TKO 100 minifluorometer and TKO standard kit. Samples containing 5 μg of total DNA were heated for 15 min at 70 °C and cooled at room temperature. NaOH was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 N, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Samples were then mixed with alkaline loading dye, loaded onto a horizontal 0.6% alkaline agarose gel, and electrophoresed at 30 V (1.5 V/cm gel length) for 16 h. After ethidium bromide staining to confirm even loading and standard gel washes, the DNA was transferred to Zeta-Probe GT nylon membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were cross-linked and hybridized with a 32P-labeled human mtDNA-specific PCR-generated probe. Hybridization and subsequent washes were performed according to manufacturer's recommendations. DNA damage and repair were determined as described previously (25Driggers W.J. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22042-22045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Driggers W.J. Holmquist G.P. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4362-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The neutral Southern blot was performed the same way, except that there was no alkaline pretreatment of samples and no NaOH in the loading dye, the 0.6% agarose gel, or the electrophoresis buffer. DNA samples were digested withXhoI and EcoRI, and hybridization was performed with a 32P-labeled nick-translated MTS-OGG fragment. The CellTiter 96 assay (Promega), which assesses mitochondrial function, was done according to the manufacturer's recommendations 24 h after a 1-h exposure to 200, 300, 400, and 500 μm menadione. Briefly, the reagent is added to culture wells, and the cells are incubated for 2 h. The tetrazolium compound is converted to a colored formazan product that is measured at 490 nm in a 96-well plate reader. Trypan blue exclusion studies were also performed on controls and samples treated with menadione and allowed a 6-h recovery in growth media. Additionally, a clonogenic survival assay was used to determine cell survival as well as the capacity of surviving cells to proliferate. MTS-OGG transfectants and control vector (pcDNA3) transfectants were carefully counted with a hemocytometer, and 400 cells were plated into each 60-mm culture plate. These cells were allowed 24 h in normal culture medium to adhere, and then they were exposed to menadione exactly as described above, except that concentrations of 25, 50, 75, and 100 μm were used due to the increased sensitivity of cells to oxidative stress when plated at the low density required for the clonogenic assay. Each cell type was assayed at control (no menadione) and all four concentration levels in triplicate. After exposure for 1 h, normal culture medium was replaced, and plates were incubated (5% CO2 at 37 °C) for 10 days. Then plates were rinsed with warm phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with a solution of 3 parts methanol:1 part acetic acid for 10 min. Finally, the plates were stained with hematoxylin, and colonies were counted. All statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test to compare individual means with significant differences at a confidence level of p< 0.05. To increase repair of oxidative damage in mtDNA, a construct with the hOGG gene fused to the mitochondrial targeting sequence from human MnSOD (32Shimoda-Matsubayashi S. Matsumine H. Kobayashi T. Nakagawa- Hattori Y. Shimizu Y. Mizuno Y. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 226: 561-565Google Scholar) was prepared (Fig. 1 A). After transfection of HeLa cells with the MTS-OGG construct or control vector (pcDNA3) and 2 weeks of selection, DNA was isolated from pcDNA3 (vector only)-transfected cells and MTS-OGG cells, and a neutral Southern blot was performed to check for integration of the transfected DNA. Fig. 1 B shows that the MTS-OGG sequence was recognized only in the MTS-OGG-transfected cells, where the predicted 1.1-kilobase band can be seen. Mitochondrial, nuclear, and cytoplasmic fractions were isolated from vector only transfectants and MTS-OGG transfectants by differential centrifugation, and Western blots were performed with a polyclonal antibody to human OGG1. Fig. 2shows an additional 39-kDa recombinant protein in the mitochondria of the MTS-OGG-transfected sample. No differences in protein bands were detected in lanes containing nucleus- or cytosolic-enriched fractions. Even loading was confirmed with Coomassie Blue staining. To further establish that the recombinant protein is in mitochondria, we also performed Western blot analysis for the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c and found it in the mitochondria (but not nucleus or cytosol) with equal amounts in both the vector- and MTS-OGG-transfected samples (Fig. 2). Thus, it can be concluded that the construct is functional in targeting additional human OGG to mitochondria. To analyze the enzymatic activity of the additional OGG protein in the mitochondria of stable transfectants, an oligonucleotide cleavage assay was used. A 24-base pair oligonucleotide with 8-oxoguanine at the 10th nucleotide was incubated with purified bacterial formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (control) or extracts from isolated mitochondria or nuclei from MTS-OGG- and vector-transfected cells, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3 shows the intact DNA and cleavage products from each of these reactions. Equal amounts of protein were used in each comparison between vector- and MTS-OGG-transfected cells. The mitochondrial extracts from MTS-OGG-transfected cells are better able to cleave the DNA than are the control cells. The nuclear extracts, on the other hand, show equal enzyme activity levels. None of the extracts or purified formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase was able to cleave an identical oligonucleotide duplex with normal guanine at position 10. Based on this assay, we conclude that the additional OGG protein targeted to mitochondria is indeed functional in removal of 8-oxoguanine and strand cleavage. Because the MTS-OGG cells have an elevated level of mitochondrial human OGG, which contains lyase activity, it is possible that repair of damage to the sugar-phosphate backbone is enhanced. To test for this, dose-response studies were performed using different concentrations of menadione, which redox cycles with complex I of the electron transport chain to form superoxide radical (33Thor H. Smith M.T. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Jewell S.A. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12419-12425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Frei B. Winterhalter K.H. Richter C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4438-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A concentration of 400 μmmenadione produced an appropriate amount of lesions (∼1 lesion per 104 normal nucleotides) in mtDNA from both MTS-OGG transfectants and control pcDNA3 transfectants. Damage to nuclear DNA was undetectable at this dose using Southern blots or quantitative extended length PCR (data not shown). Therefore, repair experiments were performed in which MTS-OGG transfectants and pcDNA3 transfectants were exposed to 400 μm menadione, followed by either immediate lysis or lysis after repair intervals of up to 6 h in normal culture medium. Control cultures were exposed to drug diluent only. DNA was isolated from the lysed cells, and quantitative Southern blots were performed to check overall damage levels and the subsequent repair of this damage. As shown in Fig.4 A, the pcDNA3 transfectants did not repair an appreciable amount of the damage to their mtDNA within the initial 6 h after drug removal, whereas the MTS-OGG transfectants repaired most of the damage in this time interval. The average amount of repair for each cell type is shown in Fig. 4 B. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the additional OGG targeted to the mitochondria is a functional enzyme and that mtDNA repair in these cells is more efficient than that in the control transfectants. To investigate whether the observed increase in mtDNA repair translates into enhanced viability after oxidative insult, three assays were used to evaluate the MTS-OGG transfectants as compared with the pcDNA3 transfectants. First, the mitochondrial function of these cells was analyzed 24 h after exposure to the menadione diluent (serum-free culture medium) or 200, 300, 400, and 500 μm menadione. Fig.5 A graphically demonstrates the average of three independent experiments. A progressive decrease in the ability of mitochondria to reduce tetrazolium compound to formazan was seen with increasing doses of menadione. A significant difference in conversion to formazan was observed between MTS-OGG cells and those transfected only with the vector at the 500 μm dose. A trypan blue exclusion assay was performed on cells treated likewise followed by 6 h of recovery time. A significantly greater percentage of the MTS-OGG cells were able to exclude the dye after 6 h (Fig. 5 B). However, because trypan blue dye exclusion and tetrazolium reduction are only transient measures of viability and are not necessarily indicative of long-term cell survival, a clonogenic survival assay also was used. Cells from the two transfected cell lines were carefully counted, and 400 cells were plated into 60-mm dishes. Due to the sparse plating conditions, these cells were more sensitive to the menadione than confluent cells. Therefore, the doses used in this assay were lower than the doses used for DNA repair studies. After 24 h in culture medium, the plates were treated with various doses of menadione for 1 h and then cultured for 10 days in normal culture medium. The resulting colonies represent cells that were not only viable but were also able to proliferate. Fig. 6 reveals that MTS-OGG cells were significantly better able to produce colonies at all concentrations tested. These viability data establish that MTS-OGG transfectants are better able to survive an oxidative challenge than the control cells.Figure 6MTS-OGG transfectants survive and multiply to form colonies after oxidative challenge. Cells were plated sparsely (400 cells per 60-mm dish) and allowed to adhere over a 24-h period. They were then treated with 25, 50, 75, or 100 μmmenadione for 1 h and placed in their normal media for 10 days. Colonies were then fixed, stained, and counted. An average of the results ± S.E. from four separate clonogenic assays is shown. An asterisk (∗) indicates a significant difference (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the targeting of a recombinant repair enzyme to mitochondria in an effort to correct deficient repair of oxidative damage in the DNA in this organelle. The isolate of HeLa cells used for these studies was selected because it was discovered that these cells do not repair oxidative damage to their mtDNA proficiently and that they grow well in culture, so"
https://openalex.org/W2015306353,"The kidney is a major organ for uptake of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) and its conversion to the active form, triiodothyronine. In the plasma, one of the T4 carriers is transthyretin (TTR). In the present study we observed that TTR, the transporter of both T4 and retinol-binding protein, binds to megalin, the multiligand receptor expressed on the luminal surface of various epithelia including the renal proximal tubules. In the kidney, megalin plays an important role in tubular uptake of macromolecules filtered through the glomerulus. To evaluate the importance of megalin for renal uptake of TTR, we performed binding/uptake assays using immortalized rat yolk sac cells with high expression levels of megalin. Radiolabeled TTR, free as well as in complex with thyroxine or retinol-binding protein, was rapidly taken up by the cells, and the uptake was strongly inhibited by a polyclonal megalin antibody and by the receptor-associated protein, a chaperone-like protein inhibiting ligand binding to megalin. In cell culture, different TTR mutations presented different levels of cell association and degradation, suggesting that the structure of TTR is important for megalin recognition. Both the apo form and the T4-bound form were taken up by the cells. Analysis of urine from patients with Dent's disease, a renal tubular disorder that alters receptor-mediated endocytic reabsorption of proteins, identified TTR as an abundant excreted protein. Furthermore, analysis of kidney sections of megalin-deficient mice revealed no immunohistochemical TTR labeling in intracellular vesicles in the proximal tubule cells when compared with wild type control littermates. Taken together, the present data indicate that TTR represents a novel megalin ligand of importance in the thyroid hormone homeostasis.

Taken together, the present data indicate that TTR represents a novel megalin ligand of importance in the thyroid hormone homeostasis. receptor associated protein retinol-binding protein transthyretin thyroxine phosphate-buffered saline Brown Norway surface plasmon resonance Proximal tubules of the kidney serve an important function for the uptake of macromolecules passing the glomerular filtration barrier. Therefore, despite the massive influx of protein in the proximal tubules, human urine is virtually devoid of significant amounts of protein. By this way the proximal tubules salvage amino acids and essential protein-bound components such as lipids, hormones, and vitamins. The receptor megalin plays an important role in the reuptake mechanism. Megalin is a multiligand endocytic receptor expressed in clathrin-coated pits at the apical surface of a number of absorptive epithelia, including those of the proximal tubule (1Christensen E.I. Nielsen S. Moestrup S.K. Borre C. Maunsbach A.B. de Heer E. Ronco P. Hammond T.G. Verroust P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 349-364PubMed Google Scholar) and yolk sac (2Zheng G. Bachinsky D.R.

Megalin is a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family (3Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and binds, as do the other members of this family, the ∼40-kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP)1 (4Christensen E.I. Gliemann J.

The general importance of megalin was supported by the findings that knockout mice for the megalin gene result in high mortality, developmental abnormalities (10Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Armstrong S.A.

In the plasma, holo-RBP strongly interacts with transthyretin (TTR), and approximately 50% of TTR circulates as a 1:1 molar TTR·RBP complex (12Raz A. Shiratori T. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1903-1912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of the TTR·RBP complex prevents to a certain extent the RBP·retinol complex from being filtered in the glomeruli. However, 4–5% of the circulating RBP·retinol is not bound to TTR (13Green M.H. Green J.B. Blomhoff R. Vitamin A in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 119-133Google Scholar) and is taken up by means of megalin in the proximal tubule (9Christensen E.I. Moskaug J.O. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Gundersen T.E. Nykjaer A.

Apart from transporting retinol via binding to RBP, plasma TTR, a tetramer of four identical subunits of approximately 14 kDa (14Blake C.C.F. Swan I.D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 61: 217-224Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar), acts as a transport protein for the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4). Most, if not all, of the active form of T4, triiodothyronine, is generated by deiodination of T4 mainly in the liver and in the proximal tubules of the kidney (15Kohrle J. Hesch R.D. Leonard J.L. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. The Thyroid. 6th Ed. Lippincott, Philadelphia1991: 144-189Google Scholar). Despite no detection of TTR mRNA in the adult kidney (16Makover A. Soprano D.R. Wyatt M.L. Goodman D.S. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 171-180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is one of the major extrahepatic sites of TTR degradation (18Makover A. Moriwaki H. Ramakrishnan R. Saraiva M.J. Blaner W.S. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8598-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), positive staining was reported in the epithelium of the renal proximal tubules (17Gray H.D. Gray E.S. Horne C.H. Virchows Arch. A Pathol. Anat. Histopathol. 1985; 406: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of TTR internalization and degradation remains to be elucidated, although a receptor-mediated uptake has been suggested (19Divino C.M. Schussler G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1425-1429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because megalin has been implicated in the renal reuptake of plasma proteins that carry lipophilic compounds, we investigated the possibility that this receptor might also play a role in renal uptake of TTR. Recombinant TTR was purified fromEscherichia coli D1210 transformed with plasmids carrying either wild type TTR (pINTRwt) or the suitable mutant TTR cDNA (pINTR30 and pINTR119) according to Almeida et al. (20Almeida M.R. Damas A.M. Lans M.C. Brower A. Saraiva M.J. Endocrine. 1997; 6: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Serum RBP was isolated by affinity in a TTR column and saturated with a molar excess of all-trans retinol (Sigma) by incubation at 37 °C in the dark for 1 h; excess retinol was separated from RBP by gel filtration in 10-ml Biogel P-6 DG columns (Bio-Rad). Recombinant RAP was expressed and purified as described previously (21Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Megalin was purified by RAP affinity chromatography from human kidney cortex according to standard procedures (22Moestrup S.K. Nielsen S. Andreasen P. Jorgensen K.E. Nykjaer A. Roigaard H. Gliemann J. Christensen E.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16564-16570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified sheep polyclonal antibodies against rat megalin have been described, and their specificity has been characterized (7Moestrup S.K. Birn H. Fischer P.B. Petersen C.M. Verroust P.J. Sim R.B. Christensen E.I. Nexo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8612-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Purified sheep non-immune IgG was used as a negative control in binding experiments. TTR and RAP were iodinated following the iodogen method. Briefly, to reaction tubes coated with 10 μg of iodogen (Sigma), 100 μl of 0.25 m phosphate buffer and 1 mCi (37 MBq) of Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added, followed by 10 μg of protein in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The reaction was allowed to proceed in an ice bath for 10 min. Labeled protein was separated from free iodide in a 5-ml Sephadex G50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For TTR, specific activities were determined after each iodination by a quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using polyclonal anti-human TTR (Dako) as the coating antibody and peroxidase-conjugated anti-human TTR (The Binding Site) as secondary antibody. 125I-labeled TTR (125I-TTR) concentration was calculated from a standard curve ranging from 5 to 200 ng/ml. Characteristic specific activities were of 104 cpm/ng. 125I-TTR was complexed with RBP by incubation with a 1:4 molar ratio of TTR:RBP for 2 h at 37 °C in the dark. 125I-TTR was complexed to T4 by incubation with a molar excess of the hormone in TNE buffer (1m Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). Free hormone was removed by gel filtration in 1-ml Sephadex LH20 columns (Sigma) equilibrated in TNE buffer. Megalin-expressing Brown Norway Rat yolk sac epithelial cells transformed with mouse sarcoma virus (BN cells) (24Le Panse S. Galceran M. Pontillon F. Lelongt B. van de Putte M. Ronco P.M. Verroust P.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 120-129PubMed Google Scholar) were grown to confluence in 24-well plates (Nunc A/S) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Before incubation cells were washed with ice-cold PBS. Incubation with 125I-TTR was carried out in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) ovalbumin for the indicated periods of time, either at 4 or 37 °C. In some experiments 125I-TTR was added in the presence of RAP (1 μm), IgG antibody against megalin (200 μg/ml), IgG antibody against cubilin (200 μg/ml), or sheep non-immune IgG (200 μg/ml). Degradation of labeled protein was measured by precipitation of the incubation medium in 10% trichloroacetic acid. In all experiments, a control was included in which the amount of degradation was assessed in the absence of cells. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by measuring radioactivity of the washed cell layer in ice-cold PBS followed by cell solubilization in 0.1 m NaOH. Total cellular protein was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cell association of 125I-TTR measured at a saturating concentration of unlabeled ligand (1 mg/ml) was considered nonspecific and subtracted from all values. Ligand and immunoblotting were performed essentially as described (7Moestrup S.K. Birn H. Fischer P.B. Petersen C.M. Verroust P.J. Sim R.B. Christensen E.I. Nexo E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8612-8617Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Briefly, BN cells were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–16%) and electroblotted onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore). Membrane strips were incubated with radiolabeled RAP (3 × 103 Bq/ml) in 10 mm Hepes, 140 mmNaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, and 1% bovine serum albumin (pH 7.8). Similar strips used for immunoblotting were blocked in 2% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in the Hepes buffer and subsequently incubated with antibody in the Hepes buffer with 0.2% nonfat dry milk. Sheep anti-rat megalin antibody was used at a dilution of 1:10,000. Receptor-ligand interactions were assessed by SPR analysis on a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore) as described (25Moestrup S.K. Schousboe I. Jacobsen C. Leheste J.R. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 902-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Megalin was immobilized onto a CM5 sensor chip, using the amine-coupling kit as described by the supplier, at indicated densities. A control channel was routinely activated and blocked in the absence of protein. Binding to coated channels was corrected for binding to noncoated channels. SPR analysis was assessed in 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20, and 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) at 20 °C. Megalin-deficient mice were produced by gene targeting as described (11Leheste J.R. Rolinski B. Vorum H. Hilpert J. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen C. Aucouturier P. Moskaug J.O. Otto A. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Wild type littermates were used as controls. Mouse megalin knockout and control kidneys were fixed by perfusion through the heart with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m sodium cacodylate buffer. The tissue was trimmed into small blocks, further fixed by immersion for 1 h in 1% paraformaldehyde, infiltrated with 2.3 m sucrose containing 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. For light microscopy, 0.8-μm cryosections were obtained at −80 °C with an FCS Reichert Ultracut cryoultramicrotome as described previously (1Christensen E.I. Nielsen S. Moestrup S.K. Borre C. Maunsbach A.B. de Heer E. Ronco P. Hammond T.G. Verroust P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 349-364PubMed Google Scholar). For immunolabeling, the sections were incubated with rabbit anti-rat TTR primary antibody (26Kato M. Kato K. Blaner W.S. Chertow B.S. Goodman D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), diluted 1:200, at room temperature for 1 h after preincubation in PBS containing 0.05 mglycine and 1% bovine serum albumin. The sections were subsequently incubated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako), and the peroxidase was visualized with diaminobenzidine. As control, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies alone or with nonspecific rabbit IgG. The sections were subsequently counterstained with Meier's stain for 2 min and examined in a Leica DMR microscope equipped with a Sony 3CCD color video camera attached to a Sony Digital still recorder. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 4.0. Overnight urine samples from six patients with Fanconi syndrome, four of whom had Dent's disease (27Wrong O.M. Norden A.G.W. Feest T.G. Q. J. Med. 1994; 87: 473-493Google Scholar) due to mutations of the renal chloride channel (28Lloyd S.E. Pearce S.H.S. Fisher S.E. Steimeyer K. Schwappach B. Scheinman S.J. Harding B. Bolino A. Devoto M. Goodyer P. Rigden S.P.A. Wrong O. Jentsch T.J. Craig I.W. Thakker R.V. Nature. 1996; 379: 445-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar), and from three healthy control subjects were refrigerated immediately after collection and stored at −80 °C until processed for immunoblotting. 10-μl urine samples were electrophoresed in 8–16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were blocked in 5% milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-human TTR (Dako) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. After washing in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, blots were incubated for 1 h with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Dako). Antibody binding was visualized using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-1-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color development substrates (Promega). To investigate the hypothesis that megalin might be responsible for the tubular uptake of T4 by internalizing TTR, we analyzed TTR binding/uptake using an established immortalized rat yolk sac epithelial cell line with high expression of megalin (24Le Panse S. Galceran M. Pontillon F. Lelongt B. van de Putte M. Ronco P.M. Verroust P.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 120-129PubMed Google Scholar).125I-TTR bound efficiently and in a saturable manner to the cells at 4 °C (Fig. 1 a), consistent with the existence of a TTR receptor. The apparentKd for the 4 °C, 4-h binding to the cells was estimated to be approximately 500 nm when assuming one class of binding sites (Fig. 1 b). 125I-TTR was rapidly taken up, and in accordance with an endocytic process, radiolabeled degradation products appeared in the medium after a lag time of approximately 30 min (Fig. 1 c). Saturating concentrations of polyclonal antibodies against megalin showed a 63% inhibition in uptake, whereas no significant effect was seen with anti-cubilin antibody nor with nonimmune IgG (Fig. 2 a). Cubilin, an apical receptor expressed in the same tissues as megalin (29Moestrup S.K. Kozyraki R. Kristiansen M. Kaysen J.H. Rasmussen H.H. Brault D. Pontillon F. Goda F.O. Christensen E.I. Hammond T.G. Verroust P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5235-5242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), is another apical receptor present in the BN cell line. The absence of significant inhibition of TTR uptake by the anti-cubilin antibody rules out the possibility of a nonspecific steric effect produced by the anti-megalin antibody that could be responsible for the observed inhibition of TTR uptake. Therefore, the BN cell line presents specific megalin-mediated TTR degradation.Figure 2a, cell association and degradation of125I-TTR in cultured rat yolk sac cells. Cell association (filled bars) and degradation (striped bars) were assessed after 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of RAP (1 μm), IgG antibody against megalin or cubilin (200 μg/ml), and sheep non-immune IgG (200 μg/ml). The data represent percents of control values (incubation of 125I-TTR plus buffer alone); the values presented represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Control incubation (100%) values were similar to the 2-h values in Fig. 1 b. b, anti-megalin immunoblotting (lane 1) and RAP ligand blotting (lane 2) of BN cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A strong inhibition in uptake was also observed with RAP (67%) (Fig. 2 a). These data further suggest that the mechanism of TTR uptake presents features of a low density lipoprotein receptor-mediated mechanism, namely, RAP sensitivity. BN cells were analyzed under non-reducing conditions by anti-megalin immunoblotting and ligand blotting with radiolabeled RAP (Fig. 2 b). The only RAP-binding protein observed was megalin, thus showing that in the BN cells, megalin is the prime RAP-binding receptor. Although these cells express cubilin, which has modest affinity for RAP, the involvement of this receptor in TTR internalization had been ruled out by competition experiments using the anti-cubilin antibody as described above. SPR (data not shown) confirmed binding of purified TTR to immobilized megalin with an approximate Kd of 5 μmat 20 °C, comparable with the low affinity of the interaction of RBP and megalin (9Christensen E.I. Moskaug J.O. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Gundersen T.E. Nykjaer A. Blomhoff R. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The influence of T4 on TTR binding to megalin could not be assessed by SPR due to the well known hydrophobicity of the hormone, resulting in nonspecific binding to the SPR sensor chip. The influence of TTR ligands on the interaction of the protein with megalin was further studied by uptake experiments of125I-TTR complexed with either RBP or T4 in the rat yolk sac epithelial cell line. No significant difference was observed, however, by the presence of TTR ligands on the degradation and cellular association of TTR (Fig. 3 a). Several point mutations in TTR have been described (30Saraiva M.J. Hum. Mutat. 1995; 5: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and most of them are associated with the occurrence of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, a disease characterized by the extracellular deposition of TTR amyloid fibrils in various tissues (31Andrade C. Brain. 1952; 75: 408-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). To study the influence of TTR mutations on the uptake by megalin, we tested TTR V30M, an amyloidogenic mutant, and TTR T199M, a non-amyloidogenic variant. The uptake of the different TTRs was corrected for their specific activities. TTR V30M was the mutant with the highest uptake, whereas TTR T119M was the variant with the lowest uptake (Fig. 3 b). These data suggested that the conformation of TTR influences the recognition by megalin. To evaluate the physiological importance of an endocytic mechanism for TTR uptake in the proximal tubules, we analyzed the urine of patients with Fanconi syndrome and Dent's disease. Dent's disease is known to be associated with tubular failure, which is probably caused by a defect in receptor-mediated endocytosis in the proximal tubules. The molecular basis of this disorder has been defined to be due to inactivating chloride channel 5 (CLC-5) mutations (28Lloyd S.E. Pearce S.H.S. Fisher S.E. Steimeyer K. Schwappach B. Scheinman S.J. Harding B. Bolino A. Devoto M. Goodyer P. Rigden S.P.A. Wrong O. Jentsch T.J. Craig I.W. Thakker R.V. Nature. 1996; 379: 445-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Furthermore CLC-5 has been shown to be present in the early endosomes of the receptor-mediated tubular endocytic pathway, in which megalin is the prime receptor (32Devuyst O. Christie P.T. Courtoy P.J. Beauwens R. Thakker R.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis clearly identified TTR in the urine of patients with Fanconi syndrome, whereas it was absent in control individuals (Fig. 4). This suggested that in vivo TTR might be taken up in the proximal tubules by an endocytic mechanism. To further demonstrate that the receptor responsible for tubular uptake of TTR in vivo is megalin, we compared proximal tubules of megalin knockout mice and control animals by TTR immunohistochemistry. Light microscope immunohistochemistry revealed a granular staining pattern for TTR in renal proximal tubules of control mice (Fig. 5 a). The staining was observed only in segment 1 of the proximal tubule and probably only the initial part of segment 1, indicating that the protein under physiological conditions is removed very efficiently in the early part of the proximal tubule after glomerular filtration. Megalin-deficient mice (Fig. 5 b) presented no staining in kidneys, suggesting absence of TTR uptake in the proximal tubules. In both wild type and knockout animals, erythrocytes were stained because of endogenous peroxidase activity (Fig. 5). The absence of TTR vesicular labeling in the proximal tubules of megalin-deficient mice demonstrates that these animals lack the endocytic mechanism of TTR tubular uptake present in the control animals. TTR therefore represents a novel megalin ligand. The present study reveals that megalin is a receptor for tubular uptake of TTR. Megalin interaction with TTR was demonstrated in vitro by SPR analysis and by uptake studies of125I-TTR in cells with high expression levels of megalin. Although the affinity of TTR for this receptor is relatively low, it is the same order of magnitude previously reported for other megalin ligands (11Leheste J.R. Rolinski B. Vorum H. Hilpert J. Nykjaer A. Jacobsen C. Aucouturier P. Moskaug J.O. Otto A. Christensen E.I. Willnow T.E. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1361-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Further evidence pointing to the in vivorelevance of this interaction came from the observations that patients with renal tubule failure excrete TTR in the urine and also that megalin knockout mice do not present lysosomal accumulation of TTR in renal tubules when compared with control wild type littermates. Because TTR is a carrier of T4 and retinol (in the latter case by the formation of a complex with RBP), it is possible that the presented mechanism is of potential importance in the transepithelial transport of retinol or thyroxine or both. Because RBP is also a megalin ligand (9Christensen E.I. Moskaug J.O. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Gundersen T.E. Nykjaer A. Blomhoff R. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TTR might be more important for the renal uptake of T4. Thyroid hormones are synthesized in the thyroid gland and are important in regulating basal metabolism and in controlling cellular growth and differentiation (33Stein S.A. Adams P.M. Shanklin D.R. Mihailoff G.A. Palnitkar M.B. Bercu B.B. Shulman D.I. Advances in Perinatal Thyroidology. Plenum Press, New York1991: 47-105Google Scholar). T4 represents the majority of the hormone synthesized and the major circulating form in the plasma. Triiodothyronine, the biologically active form of the hormone, derives mostly from T4 deiodination in the peripheral tissues including the kidney (15Kohrle J. Hesch R.D. Leonard J.L. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. The Thyroid. 6th Ed. Lippincott, Philadelphia1991: 144-189Google Scholar). Once secreted, more than 99% of the thyroid hormones in circulation are bound to plasma proteins. In human plasma, TTR is one of the three proteins responsible for the transport of T4, the main carrier being thyroxine-binding globulin; albumin is the third T4-binding protein and the one that presents the lowest affinity for the hormone (14Blake C.C.F. Swan I.D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 61: 217-224Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In rodent serum, TTR is the major carrier of T4. Interestingly, albumin is known to be taken up in the proximal tubules by two receptors: megalin and the co-localizing receptor, cubilin (34Birn H. Fyfe J. Jacobsen C. Mounier F. Verroust P.J. Ørskov H. Willnow T.E. Moestrup S.K. Christensen E.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Plasma TTR derives mostly from the liver and transports about 15% of T4, which may be reabsorbed via megalin. However, in transthyretin null mice (35Episkopou V. Maeda S. Nishiguchi S. Shimada K. Gaitanaris G.A. Gottesman M.E. Robertson E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2375-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) it was shown that T4 and triiodothyronine tissue content is normal in the case of the kidney and that the amount of deiodinase mRNA, which is directly correlated with the enzymatic activity, remains unaltered in this tissue (36Palha J.A. Hays M.T. Morreale de Escobar G. Episkopou V. Gottesman M.E. Saraiva M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E485-E493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the putative importance of TTR in the normal physiological uptake of T4 should not be disregarded, because it is possible that a redundant mechanism accounts for T4 uptake in TTR knockout mice. The thyroid hormone status of megalin knockouts should be addressed in the future for the possibility that these animals excrete T4 in the urine as a result of a lack of TTR uptake in the proximal tubules. Several point mutations have been described in TTR (30Saraiva M.J. Hum.

Mutat. 1995; 5: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Most of these mutations are related to the occurrence of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, which is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in several tissues, particularly in the peripheral nervous system (31Andrade C. Brain. 1952; 75: 408-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Some of these TTR mutants were used to evaluate binding to megalin, and in accordance with the binding data, TTR structure seems to be important for the uptake by megalin. It is interesting to note that TTR plasma levels are decreased in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy V30M patients (37Saraiva M.J. M Costa P.P. Goodman D.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2171-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), despite an equal expression of the variant and normal TTR in the liver. These facts suggested that TTR metabolism could be involved in the amyloid formation process. Comparative clearance studies of TTR V30M and TTR T119M have been performed (38Alves I. Hays M.T. Saraiva M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and showed a slower clearance for TTR T119M and a faster one for TTR V30M. This led to the hypothesis that, at least in part, the different clearances could account for the differences in circulating plasma levels observed for each of the mutations. It was speculated that one of the factors that might be involved in the existence of differences in clearance would be the existence of cellular receptors for TTR with different affinities for the two mutant forms of the protein. This has been demonstrated here in the case of megalin. TTR has also been described to interact with a variety of compounds; the significance of these interactions is, in most cases, still unexplained. These minor TTR ligands include noradrenaline oxidation products (39Boomsma F. Veld A.J.M. Schalekamp A.D.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 259: 551-557PubMed Google Scholar), pterins (40Ernstrom U. Petterson T. Jornvall H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), chicken lutein, hemin and hemoglobin (41Martone R. Herbert J. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 20: 176Google Scholar), polyhalogenated compounds (42Cheek A.O. Kow K. Chen J. McLachlan J.A. Environ.

Acta. 1994; 1199: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The megalin-mediated TTR uptake in the proximal tubules may also be important in the uptake of these TTR ligands. In conclusion, the findings here presented show TTR as a novel megalin ligand with potential importance in T4 transepithelial transport and reinforce the concept that megalin is a general endocytic receptor for protein in the proximal tubule (23Christensen E.I. Birn H. Verroust P. Moestrup S.K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 180: 237-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with a multifaceted role in retaining and capturing vital substances from the tubular fluid after glomerular filtration.

We have expressed and purified the full-length ClpB and three truncated variants with the N-terminal, C-terminal, and a double N- and C-terminal deletion. We studied the protein concentration-dependent and ATP-induced oligomerization of ClpB, casein-induced activation of ClpB ATPase, and ClpB-assisted reactivation of denatured firefly luciferase. We found that both the N- and C-terminal truncation of ClpB strongly inhibited its chaperone activity. The reasons for such inhibition were different, however, for the N- and C-terminal truncation. Deletion of the C-terminal domain inhibited the self-association of ClpB, which led to decreased affinity for ATP and to decreased ATPase and chaperone activity of the C-terminally truncated variants. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal domain did not inhibit the self-association of ClpB and its basal ATPase activity but decreased the ability of casein to activate ClpB ATPase.

Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Whereas chaperones promote protein folding and prevent protein aggregation, proteases eliminate damaged proteins and those that cannot be rescued by chaperones. Among protein families that are involved in such quality control, Clp ATPases (also referred to as Hsp100 proteins) play an essential role as members of both the chaperone and the protease machinery (1Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar, 2Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem.

The role of Clp ATPases in such complexes is to unfold protein substrates and deliver them to the peptidases for degradation (3Weber-Ban E.U. Reid B.G. Miranker A.D. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1999; 401: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). In contrast, ClpB from E. coli and Thermus thermophilus as well as Hsp104 fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae do not associate with peptidases. Instead, these proteins participate in multi-chaperone systems that efficiently inhibit and reverse protein aggregation (4Zolkiewski M. J. Biol.

ClpA, ClpB, and Hsp104 contain two highly conserved nucleotide binding domains that are separated by a variable-length middle region and enclosed between less conserved N- and C-terminal regions (see Fig. 1) (2Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). ClpX and ClpY contain a single nucleotide binding domain and the C-terminal domain that is similar to that of ClpA, ClpB, or Hsp104 (2Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S.

Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar) of Clp ATPases, it is evident that the nucleotide binding domains play an important functional role. The role of the N- and C-terminal regions in Clp ATPases is, however, less clear. The N-terminal sequences of Clp ATPases do not contain any recognized consensus motifs. The C-terminal sequences show a distant similarity to protein binding PDZ domains (13Levchenko I. Smith C.K. Walsh N.P. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 939-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been found that isolated C-terminal fragments of ClpA, ClpB, ClpX, and ClpY selectively interact with several proteins (14Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the C-terminal regions in Clp ATPases form “sensor and substrate discrimination” (SSD)1domains that are involved in recognizing protein substrates and guiding them into cavities inside the Clp hexamers. A recently determined crystal structure of ClpY (also known as HslU) does not support, however, the SSD hypothesis (15Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In hexameric ClpY, the C-terminal domain of each monomer faces either the outside of an adjacent monomer or the solvent. Thus, the C-terminal domain may not be involved in the transfer of protein substrates into the intra-hexamer cavity. The ClpB gene contains an internal translation-initiation site and is expressed in vivo as two gene products: a full-length 95-kDa and a truncated 80-kDa polypeptide chain (ClpB95 and ClpB80) (16Squires C.L. Pedersen S. Ross B.M. Squires C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4254-4262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The internal initiation site is located near the N terminus of the first nucleotide binding domain in ClpB. Thus, the N-terminal region of ClpB95 is not present in ClpB80. It has been found that although both ClpB95 and ClpB80 hydrolyze ATP, the ATPase activity of ClpB95, but not ClpB80, is strongly activated by other proteins (18Park S.K. Kim K.I. Woo K.M. Seol J.H. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggests that not only the C-terminal regions (SSD domains), but also the N-terminal regions in Clp ATPases, may be involved in binding protein substrates. In this study, we focused on the role of the N- and C-terminal domains in ClpB by comparing properties of the full-length and the truncated ClpB forms in which the terminal regions have been removed. We tested the ClpB variants using four assays that reflect four different aspects of ClpB activity: protein concentration-dependent self-association, ATP-induced self-association, casein-stimulated ATPase activity, and ClpB-assisted protein reactivation. We found that both terminal regions of ClpB are essential for the chaperone activity. However, whereas the N-terminal region of ClpB is involved in interactions with protein substrates, the C-terminal region supports protein self-association. This result demonstrates a previously unknown function of the PDZ-like SSD domain in ClpB. The DNA fragments encoding ClpB residues 1–857 (full-length ClpB), residues 149–857 (ClpBΔN), residues 1–769 (ClpBΔC), or residues 149–769 (ClpBΔNC) were produced by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned between theNdeI and XhoI sites of pET-20b (Novagen). The plasmid pBS-ClpB93 (18Park S.K. Kim K.I. Woo K.M. Seol J.H. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol.

The cloned DNA fragments contained 3′-end STOP codons to prevent translation of the 6-His C-terminal extension in pET-20b. ClpB and its truncated variants were overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)LysS (Novagen) and purified with the procedure similar to that used before to obtain wild type ClpB (9Zolkiewski M.

Protein expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were grown at 37 °C for 2 h after induction and were collected by centrifugation. Protein purification steps were performed on ice or at 4 °C. Cell pellets (∼10 g) were suspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) and disrupted by sonication. The cell extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 45 min. Polyethyleneimine was added to the supernatant (final concentration 0.04% polyethyleneimine), and the turbid solution was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 60 min. Supernatant was loaded onto a 170-ml Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after adding 0.1m KCl. After washing the column with buffer A with 0.1m KCl at 1 ml/min, proteins were eluted using a 0.1–0.4m KCl gradient. Collected fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the fractions containing ClpB were pooled and precipitated in 60% (NH4)2SO4. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dissolved in buffer A with 0.1m KCl. The sample was loaded onto a 70-cm Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 0.4 ml/min. Collected fractions were analyzed with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fractions containing >95% pure ClpB were pooled and precipitated with (NH4)2SO4. For further use, the ClpB samples were extensively dialyzed in buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m KCl, 20 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) or in modified buffers (see Figs. 3 and 5). Protein concentration was measured using the absorption coefficientA 280 = 0.38 cm2/mg (9Zolkiewski M. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Maurizi M.R.

The temperature of the cell was controlled by an external programmable water bath (Fisher Isotemp 1016P). For thermal stability studies, a 0.1-cm water-jacketed cell was used, the temperature was increased stepwise, and samples were equilibrated at a given temperature until a steady CD signal was obtained. A Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge with a four-position AN-Ti rotor was used for sedimentation velocity experiments. Protein solution and a reference buffer were loaded into the right and left sector, respectively, of a double sector 1.2-cm cell with an aluminum centerpiece. Three centrifuge cells containing three protein samples (ClpB, ClpBΔN, and ClpBΔC) were simultaneously analyzed in the centrifugation experiment. After equilibration at 3,000 rpm and 20 °C, the rotor was accelerated to a desired speed, and radial scans of protein concentration profiles in the cells were performed. The sedimentation velocity data were analyzed with a time-derivative method (19Stafford III, W.F. Anal.

HPLC gel filtration experiments were performed using Superose 6 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a Hewlett Packard 1050 liquid chromatography system with a diode array UV-visible absorption detector. Gel filtration standards were obtained from Bio-Rad. ClpB samples were incubated at 37 °C in the assay buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) without or with 0.1 mg/ml κ-casein (Sigma). Inorganic phosphate concentration was determined using the malachite green assay (20Hess H.H. Derr J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 21Lanzetta P.A.

Heat of ATP binding to ClpB was measured with a MicroCal MCS isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Northampton, Massachusetts). The 1.3-ml calorimetric cell was filled with degassed buffer B or with degassed ClpB solution. Aliquots of ATP in buffer B were added with a 250-μl injection syringe. Heat effects of the ATP injections were calculated by integrating the calorimetric output curves using software supplied with the calorimeter. Recombinant firefly luciferase (Promega) was diluted into the unfolding buffer (30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 7 m urea) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For refolding, the denatured luciferase was rapidly diluted 100-fold into the renaturation buffer (30 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 120 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing ClpB or its variants and DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE (StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, BC, Canada). The activity of luciferase during refolding was determined as described before (4Zolkiewski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28083-28086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the postulated domain structure of ClpB and compares four protein variants used in this study. We have purified the full-length 95-kDa ClpB, which corresponds to ClpB95, the N-terminally truncated 80-kDa ClpBΔN, which corresponds to ClpB80, and the C-terminally truncated 85-kDa ClpBΔC. The C-terminal region that has been removed in ClpBΔC is four amino acids shorter than the SSD domain from ClpB investigated by Smith et al. (14Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We have also purified a doubly-truncated 70-kDa ClpBΔNC with the combined N- and C-terminal deletions. The proteins were >95% pure, as determined by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels, and their apparent molecular weights corresponded to those predicted from the amino acid sequence. We have tested whether the terminal deletions affected the folding of ClpB and its thermodynamic stability. We measured circular dichroism (CD) spectra for ClpB and the truncated variants (Fig.2 A). The CD spectra showed a negative double band at 210–222 nm and a positive band at <200 nm, which indicates that ClpB contains α-helical structures. No apparent difference was observed between the CD spectra of the full-length and truncated ClpB. This result indicates that the average secondary structure (per residue) in all ClpB variants is similar. Thus, terminal truncations in ClpB do not affect secondary structure of the two ATP binding domains and the middle sequence region (see Fig. 1). ClpB contains two Trp residues. Trp-462 is located in the middle sequence region, and Trp-543 is within the C-terminal ATP binding domain (NBD2). The fluorescence spectrum of ClpB showed a single emission maximum at 350 nm, and no apparent differences in shape or intensity of the emission band were observed between the full-length ClpB and the truncated variants (not shown). This result indicates that the terminal truncations in ClpB do not produce changes in the environment of Trp residues. As shown by the temperature dependence of the CD signal (Fig.2 B), ClpB unfolds cooperatively during thermal denaturation, with a mid-point temperature of 56 °C. Cooperative transitions with similar mid-point temperatures (±1 °C) were also observed for the N-terminally and C-terminally truncated ClpB. Cooperative unfolding at 56 °C indicates that the conformation of ClpB is thermodynamically stable at the assay temperatures used in this study. We found that the N- and C-terminal truncations do not destabilize the folded conformation of ClpB. We conclude that the two ATP binding domains and the middle sequence region form the main folding stability core of ClpB. Association equilibria manifest themselves in a protein concentration dependence of the size of a protein. We used sedimentation velocity experiments (Fig.3) to monitor the difference in apparent size of ClpB between low protein concentration (0.2 mg/ml) and high concentration (4.0 mg/ml). In a sedimentation velocity experiment, protein concentration profiles in a centrifuge cell are measured at different times during centrifugation. The shape of such concentration profiles is related to homogeneity and diffusion properties of species in solution, whereas the rate of movement of a concentration boundary gives the sedimentation coefficient. At 0.2 mg/ml, both the full-length ClpB and ClpBΔC (Fig. 3, A and E) sedimented slower than ClpBΔN (Fig. 3 C). However, at 4.0 mg/ml, both the full-length ClpB and ClpBΔN (Fig. 3, B andD) sedimented faster than ClpBΔC (Fig. 3 F). Fig. 4 shows apparent distributions of the sedimentation coefficient (g(s*)) for ClpB obtained from the time-derivative analysis (19Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) of the data in Fig. 3. In Fig. 4, the s* values corresponding to the maxima ofg(s*) profiles approximate the observed sedimentation coefficients for molecular species predominating in a protein sample. Single g(s*) maxima were observed for the full-length ClpB and ClpBΔN at high concentration (Fig. 4,A and B, dotted lines) and for ClpBΔC at both low and high concentration (Fig. 4 C), which indicates that those protein samples contained a single predominant molecular component. In contrast, the sedimentation data for the full-length ClpB and, more noticeably, ClpBΔN at low concentration (Fig. 4, A and B, solid lines) indicated the presence of more components with significantly different sedimentation coefficients. The concentration dependence ofg(s*) profiles for ClpB and ClpBΔN is similar to that observed for wild type ClpB (a mixture of ClpB95 and ClpB80). It has been shown that wild type ClpB is monomeric at ∼0.1 mg/ml and forms hexamers at 4.0 mg/ml (9Zolkiewski M. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Maurizi M.R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the population of oligomers of ClpBΔN at 0.2 mg/ml is significantly higher than of the full-length ClpB. Table I contains the values of sedimentation coefficient of the ClpB variants at low and high protein concentration obtained from the maxima of g(s*). For comparison, the data for wild type ClpB from Zolkiewski et al. (9Zolkiewski M. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Maurizi M.R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) are also included. At 0.2 mg/ml, the sedimentation coefficients of the dominant component in full-length ClpB, a minor component of ClpBΔN, and ClpBΔC are close to that of the monomeric wild type ClpB. At 4.0 mg/ml, the sedimentation coefficients of the full-length ClpB and ClpBΔN approximate that of the oligomeric wild type ClpB. This result indicates that the full-length ClpB as well as ClpBΔN undergo a concentration-dependent self-association. Interestingly, unlike the full-length ClpB, ClpBΔN at low concentration contains a dominant fast sedimenting component. 2It has been shown that the apparent sedimentation coefficients observed when two components are present in solution do not represent the sedimentation coefficients of the pure components (22Stafford III, W.F. Schuster T.M. Laue T.M. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhaeuser Boston, Cambridge, MA1994: 119-137Crossref Google Scholar). This can be the reason fors 20,w of the major component in ClpBΔN at 0.2 mg/ml to be less than s 20,w of ClpBΔN at 4 mg/ml (Table I). This indicates that the association of ClpB is enhanced after removal of the N-terminal domain. In contrast, the sedimentation coefficient of ClpBΔC does not increase upon increasing protein concentration. This result implies that the self-association of ClpB is inhibited after removal of the C-terminal domain. It has been shown that the associated form of wild type ClpB is stabilized by ATP (9Zolkiewski M. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Maurizi M.R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We used gel filtration chromatography to study self-association of the truncated variants of ClpB in the presence of ATP (protein concentration on the column ∼0.1 mg/ml). As shown in Fig. 5, ATP stabilizes hexameric ClpB and ClpBΔN. Monomeric species of the full-length ClpB and ClpBΔN were not found in the presence of ATP (compare with Fig. 4 for 0.2 mg/ml ClpB). However, ATP does not induce self-association of ClpBΔC and ClpBΔNC, which elute as monomers. This result indicates that the association deficiency in the C-terminally truncated variants of ClpB cannot be overcome by ATP binding. Among the ClpB variants investigated in this work, ClpBΔN displayed the highest rate of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 6 A). The full-length ClpB hydrolyzed ATP with a lower rate than ClpBΔN, whereas ClpBΔC and ClpBΔNC had no detectable ATPase activity. It is known that Clp ATPases are activated by other proteins (2Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). We measured the rate of ATP hydrolysis by ClpB in the presence of κ-casein. We found that the ATPase of the full-length ClpB was activated ∼20-fold by casein, whereas that of ClpBΔN was activated only ∼5-fold (Fig.6 B). This indicates that the N-terminally truncated ClpB is deficient in transferring the protein binding signal to the ATPase active sites, in agreement with previous results (18Park S.K. Kim K.I. Woo K.M. Seol J.H. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No ATPase activity was detected for ClpBΔC and ClpBΔNC in the presence of casein. We investigated whether the loss of ATPase in ClpBΔC and ClpBΔNC is due to defects in ATP binding to the C-terminally truncated ClpB. Fig.7 shows calorimetric titrations of ClpB and ClpBΔC with ATP. Injections of ATP into the buffer produced endothermic effects due to the heat of dilution of ATP (Fig.7 A, upper trace). Injections of ATP into solution of the full-length ClpB resulted in a complex calorimetric output due to a combination of ATP binding to ClpB, ATP-induced association of ClpB, and ATP hydrolysis. However, it is evident from the lower trace in Fig. 7 A that a strong exothermic reaction became saturated after a few ATP injections, and the remaining part of the trace was dominated by the endothermic effect of ATP dilution. A similar calorimetric trace was also measured during titration of ClpBΔN with ATP (not shown). In contrast, injections of ATP into solution of ClpBΔC produced weak exothermic effects that did not show saturation up to 1 mm ATP (Fig. 7 A, middle trace, and B). ClpBΔC does not hydrolyze ATP (see Fig. 6) nor does it self-associate in the presence of ATP (see Fig. 5). Thus, heat effects of adding ATP to ClpBΔC can be attributed to protein-nucleotide interactions. We conclude that ClpBΔC binds ATP with a low affinity, most likely with K d > 1 mm. We tested the ClpB variants in a luciferase reactivation assay that had been previously used to detect chaperone activity of ClpB (4Zolkiewski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28083-28086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In this assay, no spontaneous recovery of luciferase is observed due to its intense aggregation. Efficient reactivation of luciferase requires ClpB and a group of three otherE. coli chaperones: DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE (4Zolkiewski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28083-28086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, the full-length ClpB efficiently reactivated luciferase with a ∼30-min “lag phase,” similar to that observed for wild type ClpB (4Zolkiewski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28083-28086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). All truncated variants, ClpBΔN, ClpBΔC, and ClpBΔNC, were deficient in their chaperone activity. This indicates that both terminal regions of ClpB are essential for its function as a molecular chaperone. We have purified and studied the full-length ClpB and its three terminally truncated variants. We have found full inhibition of the chaperone activity in all truncated ClpB variants. We have also observed inhibition of self-association and ATPase activity in the C-terminally truncated ClpB and inhibition of casein-activated ATPase in the N-terminally truncated ClpB. The N-terminal and C-terminal truncations did not apparently affect the folding and stability of the remaining domains of ClpB. Thus, the observed effects of truncations can be attributed to the roles of the N-terminal and C-terminal parts of ClpB. As shown in this study for the full-length ClpB and in Zolkiewskiet al. (9Zolkiewski M. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Maurizi M.R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) for wild type protein, there is a reversible equilibrium between monomeric and hexameric ClpB in solution without nucleotides. The most striking structural effect of the C-terminal deletion in ClpB is a complete inhibition of protein oligomerization (see Figs. 3 and 4). This result is consistent with position of the C-terminal domain in the crystal structure of ClpY (15Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of ClpY is located on the outside of the ClpY hexamer and is in contact with the neighboring subunit within the hexamer. Our results indicate that contacts maintained by the C-terminal domain are necessary for stabilization of the ClpB hexamer. Deletion of the C-terminal and the N-terminal regions of ClpB have opposite effects on protein oligomerization. Compared with the full-length ClpB, the association equilibrium in ClpBΔN is shifted toward the hexamer (Figs. 3 and 4). Since both the full-length ClpB (ClpB95) and ClpBΔN (ClpB80) are produced in vivo and form mixed oligomers (9Zolkiewski M. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Maurizi M.R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1899-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), our results raise a possibility that the association properties of wild type ClpB can be modulated by the relative amounts of ClpB95 and ClpB80. What is the reason for the observed inhibition of the ATPase activity of ClpB upon removal of the C-terminal domain (see Fig. 6)? Again, the crystal structure of ClpY provides a possible explanation. In the ClpY hexamer, nucleotide molecules are bound at the interfaces between adjacent subunits (15Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that nucleotide contacts with both adjacent subunits are necessary for maintaining strong nucleotide binding, because monomeric ClpBΔC binds ATP with low affinity (Fig. 7). In addition, ATP binding to two adjacent ClpB subunits may be necessary to trigger ATP hydrolysis. Since the chaperone function of ClpB requires ATP hydrolysis (4Zolkiewski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28083-28086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), the final result of the oligomerization deficiency in ClpBΔC and ClpBΔNC is an inhibition of chaperone activity of these proteins (Fig. 8). Weak binding of ATP to monomeric ClpBΔC indicates that in the monomer-hexamer equilibrium, ATP may bind predominantly to the hexameric ClpB. Such preferential binding of ATP results in a shift of the thermodynamic equilibrium in favor of the hexamer (23Wyman J. Gill S.J. Binding and Linkage. Functional Chemistry of Biological Macromolecules. University Science Books, Mill Valley, California1990: 206-207Google Scholar). Change in protein association equilibrium manifests itself as the ATP-induced stabilization of hexameric ClpB and ClpBΔN (Fig. 5). Such shifts in coupled equilibria can occur in addition to possible ATP-induced conformational changes within ClpB. Conversely, changes in the relative amounts of ClpB monomers and hexamers can modulate the ability of ClpB to bind and hydrolyze ATP. Enhanced self-association affinity of ClpBΔN, as compared with the full-length ClpB, may be the reason for the elevated basal ATPase activity of ClpBΔN (Fig.6 A). ClpBΔN displays a much weaker activation of its ATPase in the presence of casein than does the full-length ClpB (Fig. 6 Band Ref. 18Park S.K. Kim K.I. Woo K.M. Seol J.H. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the basal ATPase of ClpB is not inhibited by the N-terminal truncation, we conclude that the N-terminal region of ClpB is involved in either direct interaction with casein or in the coupling between the protein-binding site and the ATPase sites. Defects in protein binding properties manifest themselves in a decreased chaperone activity of ClpBΔN (Fig. 8). It should be noted, however, that although the ATPase of ClpBΔN does respond to casein to some extent, the chaperone activity of ClpB is completely abolished after the N-terminal truncation. In summary, all terminally truncated variants of ClpB have low chaperone activity, but the reasons for this deficiency are different for the C-terminal and the N-terminal truncation. Recent publication of the crystal structure of ClpY (HslU) and the ATP-dependent protease ClpYQ (HslU-HslV) gives, for the first time, high resolution structural information for a Clp ATPase (15Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Partial homology between ClpY and ClpB (2Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) suggests that the C-terminal domain of ClpB and its C-terminal ATP binding domain (NBD2) may assume conformations similar to analogous regions in ClpY. However, high resolution information is not available for the N-terminal domain, NBD1, and the middle domain of ClpB. As described above, our experiments in solution support predictions made from the ClpY crystal structure. In particular, we have shown that the C-terminal region of ClpB primarily supports protein self-association. This conclusion is consistent with the crystal structure of ClpY (15Bochtler M. Hartmann C. Song H.K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 2000; 403: 800-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and is different from that of Smith et al. (14Smith C.K. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6678-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), who postulated that the C-terminal fragment forms a substrate binding domain. Our results indicate that the site, which is essential for chaperone activity and is also responsive to casein binding, is located in the N-terminal region of ClpB. Although the N-terminal regions of ClpA and Hsp104 are similar to that of ClpB, other Clp ATPases (ClpX, ClpY) do not contain analogous domains. Thus, ClpX and ClpY may use other sequence motifs to recognize and bind protein substrates. Unifying biochemical characteristics of Clp ATPases are protein-activated ATPase activity and ATP-induced oligomerization (2Schirmer E.C. Glover J.R. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 289-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). So far, it has not been clear how these two properties are coupled with each other and with the activity of Clp proteins as either ATP-dependent chaperones or ATP-dependent proteases. Our results indicate that the propensity of Clp ATPases to form oligomers is an important feature of these proteins that is necessary for their ATPase activity and the biological function.

Chemokine activity of Trx has also recently been discovered in vivo and in vitro, and this function is not mediated via known chemokine receptors (22Bertini R. Howard O.M.Z. Dong H. Oppenheim J.J.

In this study we have prepared large quantities of recombinant homogenous Trx80 and characterized the molecule.

A product of approximately 240 base pairs was purified.Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) cells transformed with the pET 3d-Trx80 plasmid were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.5 at 595 nm and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside. The induced cells were harvested by centrifugation after 4 h of induction. The bacterial pellet was dissolved in 5 ml of TE buffer with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 1 gram of bacterial pellet and lyzed using a combination of lysozyme and sonication. Then 10 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, and 50 μg/ml DNase1 were added, and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min. Trx80 was found to be present in inclusion bodies. The pellet fraction was therefore washed with 0.5 murea, incubated on ice for 15 min, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min, and subsequently dissolved in 5 m urea. After this incubation the protein was soluble and was upon centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min dialyzed extensively against TE buffer. Subsequently the protein was applied to a DE52 column pre-equilibrated with TE buffer and was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. The protein was eluted around 125 mm NaCl and apparently pure when analyzed on a silver-stained 20% homogenous SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Nevertheless it was reduced by excess DTT and applied to a reverse-phase column (RPC 18, fast protein liquid chromatography) pre-equilibrated with 0.1% NH4HCO3 and eluted with 0.1% NH4HCO3 and 50% acetonitrile. To concentrate the protein, the acetonitrile was removed by evaporation, and the buffer was changed to TE by repeated additions using a Diaflo equipment and a 3-kDa cut-off membrane. This pure Trx80 was then aliquoted and stored at −20 °C. The protein was fully characterized as pure Trx80 using N-terminal sequencing and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Protein Analysis Center, Karolinska Institutet). Trx, calf thymus TrxR, and Trx84 were purified as described previously (9Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Sahaf B. Söderberg A. Spyrou G. Barral A.M. Pekkari K. Holmgren A. Rosén A. Exp.

A Coomassie-stained 20% homogenous SDS-polyacrylamide gel with Trx80 and Trx using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech phastgel system is shown in Fig. 1. A theoretical molar extinction coefficient for Trx80 was calculated to 8383 m−1 cm−1 (33Aitken A. Learmonth M. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 3-6Crossref Google Scholar). An experimental molar extinction coefficient was determined by dissolving 5 mg of dry protein powder in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and A 280 nm was recorded after appropriate dilutions. This gave an experimental value of 8250 m−1 cm−1. This was used to calculate concentrations of pure Trx80. Concentrations for Trx was measured at 280 nm and calculated with molar extinction coefficient 8250 m−1 cm−1 (9Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Free SH groups were determined at A 412 nm using 1 mm 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and a molar extinction coefficient of 13 600 m−1cm−1 (9Ren X. Björnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). CD spectra of Trx80 was recorded at 25 °C in TE buffer and was compared with the CD spectra of full-length Trx. The CD spectra analyses were performed in a cell path length of 0.2 mm on an Aviv spectrophotometer. Gel filtration experiments were carried out on Sephadex G-50 and G-75 columns. The Sephadex columns were pre-equilibrated with TE buffer containing 1 mm DTT. Both Trx and Trx80 were reduced with 10 mm DTT prior to applying the proteins on the columns. The Sephadex G-75 column had a volume of 131 ml, the sample volume was 2.6 ml, and the flow rate was 5 ml/cm2/h. The concentrations of protein ranged from 1.3 to 2.6 mg/ml. The NADPH consumption assay was carried out at 20 °C in a total volume of 500 μl with 200 μmNADPH in TE buffer. The reaction cuvette contained 10 μmoxidized Trx80 with three free SH groups, and the reaction was initiated by adding 10 μg of calf thymus TrxR (32Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) to both the reference and the reaction cuvette, and theA 340 nm was recorded. This was followed by addition of 1 μm Trx to both the reference and the reaction cuvette, and NADPH consumption was followed at 340 nm using a Zeiss PM Q3 spectrophotometer equipped with an automatic zero control of the reference cuvette and a recorder. Human PBMC were prepared by standard Ficoll-Paque centrifugation of heparinized blood from healthy donors (Blood Bank, Karolinska Hospital). The cells at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml were suspended in serum-free AIM V medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) for all cell experiments except the experiment where the increase in cell number was investigated. In this experiment PBMC were at a concentration of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Before addition to cell cultures, Trx and Trx80 were reduced with 10 mm of DTT in 37 °C for 60 min. To remove any possible contamination with endotoxin, the protein solutions were passed over a column with polymyxin B-linked agarose according to manufacturer's recommendation. Subsequently DTT was removed by chromatography at +4 °C over a PD 10 column pre-equilibrated with degassed ice-cold PBS. The number of free SH groups was determined, and all Trx and Trx80 used in this study had at least 2.8 free SH groups per molecule. The protein solutions were finally, prior to cell culture experiments, filtered with spin-X filters to ensure sterility. All [3H]thymidine assays were performed in 96-well flat bottom plates at 1 × 106 cells/ml in a final volume of 200 μl with all cultures incubated in triplicate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in humidified cell incubators. For determination of [3H]thymidine uptake, each well was pulsed with 0.5 μCi of 5-[3H]thymidine for 9 h prior to harvesting onto fiberglass filters using a multi-channel cell harvester (Tomtec, Wallac, Sweden). Filters were counted with a MicroBeta Plus Scintillation counter (Tomtec, Wallac). All data reported are mean cpm of triplicate cultures. Catabolism of [3H]thymidine to [3H]dihydrothymine was determined as described (34Bodycote J. Wolff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4749-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Arnér E.S.J. Valentin A. Eriksson S. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1993; 210: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and was found to be negligible in all treatments, showing that [3H]thymidine uptake thereby was a trustworthy measure of DNA replication (34Bodycote J. Wolff S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4749-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Arnér E.S.J. Valentin A. Eriksson S. J. Biol.

As controls to show that the cell growth effect seen was caused by Trx80 and not from any contaminant, two sets of experiments were performed. First, pure polyclonal goat anti-Trx80 antibodies were kept at 0.83 mg/ml in 0.2 m citrate buffer, pH 6.5, and coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B, to give a 1.5-ml column with 8 nmol of coupled antibody. Over this column 1.5 ml of Trx80 solution with 1.5 nmol of Trx80 was passed. After that 1.5 ml of PBS was added to column, and the flow through was collected; this was sterile-filtered and added to cells. In a second control experiment, the endotoxin inhibitor, polymyxin B sulfate, was added to cell cultures treated with Trx80 or lipopolysaccaride, and the [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined. Cell death was measured by trypan blue exclusion and did not exceed 10% in any experiment. The cell experiments where optical density of cell cultures were used to determine the cell number was performed as described earlier (37Kravtsov V.D. Eur. J. Cancer. 1994; 30A: 1564-1570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of cell suspension was seeded in 96-well plates with 3 μm DTT. 2.5 μg/ml phytohemoglutine A, 1 μm Trx80, or 1 μm Trx84 were added in triplicate to the cell suspension. Cells were grown for 6 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in humidified cell incubators, and the optical density at 650 nm was measured during the incubation time using a micro plate reader (Thermomax, Molecular Devices). Data were analyzed using the accompanying SOFTmax version 2.31 software. As a blank only medium and DTT was used, and as a control only 3 μm DTT was used. The final concentration of DTT was 3 μm in all cultures. Specific monoclonal mouse anti-Trx (clone 2G11) and anti-Trx80 (clone 7D11) antibodies were obtained as described previously (29Sahaf B. Söderberg A. Spyrou G. Barral A.M. Pekkari K. Holmgren A. Rosén A. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 236: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Standard samples of Trx and Trx80 were aliquoted at 100 μg/ml in PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and kept at −70 °C. Each aliquot was discarded after being thawed once. 96-well plates were coated with 50 μl of 10 μg/ml anti-Trx or anti-Trx80 antibody in PBS and incubated at +4 °C overnight. Subsequently the mixture was discarded, and 200 μl of incubation buffer (0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.02% NaN3 in PBS) was added and incubated 2 h in room temperature to block unspecific protein binding sites. Plates were washed four times with washing buffer (0.05% Tween 20 in 0.9% saline). Standard dilutions of Trx or Trx80, and samples were prepared in incubation buffer, and 50 μl of standards or samples were added in duplicates and incubated at +4 °C overnight. Thereafter plates were washed four times with washing buffer and biotinylated goat anti-Trx polyclonal antibody was added at 2 μg/ml in 50 μl and incubated 2 h in room temperature. Subsequently plates were washed four times with washing buffer, and 50 μl of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin diluted 1:1000 in incubation buffer was added and incubated 1 h in room temperature. Plates were then washed six times in washing buffer and 50 μl of 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate dissolved in 10% diethanolamine, 0.02% NaN3, 0.5 mmMgCl2, pH 9.8, was added to each well, and absorbance was recorded at 405 nm by a microplate reader (Thermomax, Molecular Devices). Data were analyzed using the accompanying SOFTmax version 2.31 software. Blood was collected anonymously by vein puncture in heparinized tubes from blood donors (n = 12) at Karolinska Hospital. Samples were subsequently centrifuged at 2000 × g for 20 min at room temperature and plasma was collected and kept at −20 °C. Degree of hemolysis in the plasma samples was determined using a commercial plasma hemoglobin kit from Sigma following the manufacturer's instructions. The hemoglobin levels in these samples varied from 29 to 67 μg/ml, corresponding to 0.02–0.05% hemolysis, assuming a normal total blood hemoglobin level of 140 g/liter. The contribution of released intracellular full-length Trx because of this degree of hemolysis to the total determined extracellular levels given in Table III was then calculated following the method of Nakamuraet al. (38Nakamura H. De Rosa S. Roederer M. Anderson M.T. Dubs J.G. Yodoi J. Holmgren A. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and found to be 2.7–6.3 ng/ml. Crude extracts of human placenta tissue were prepared by homogenization in 2 ml of TE buffer/gram of fresh placenta tissue using a Polytron tissue disruptor. The supernatant after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at +4 °C was used for the Trx determinations.Table IIIPlasma levels of thioredoxin and Trx80 in healthy individualsSubjectTrx 3-aMeasured with sandwich ELISA for Trx, presented as mean of duplicate values with standard deviations.Trx80 3-bMeasured with sandwich ELISA for Trx80, presented as mean of duplicate values with standard deviations.

Open table in a new tab The novel procedure to produce Trx80 developed in this study yielded pure protein (Fig. 1 A) free from LPS and suitable for testing in cell cultures. Because it was produced as inclusion bodies and refolded from 5 m urea, we established that the refolding had succeeded. Therefore, CD spectra of Trx80 and Trx were recorded and compared; Fig. 1 B shows that Trx and Trx80 had similar spectra with characteristic minima at 208–212 and 221–223 nm. The mean residue ellipticities of these signals were, however, lower for Trx80, which also showed a small negative band around 187 nm, whereas Trx only showed a positive shoulder at the same wavelength. The loss of the C-terminal 25 residues corresponds to loss of one helix (residues 93–105 of Trx) and one strand (residues 84–92 of Trx) (5Weichsel A. Gasdaska J.R. Powis G. Montfort W.R. Structure. 1996; 4: 735-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The CD spectra of Trx80 found here clearly established that truncated Trx80 has a substantial secondary structure and are compatible with loss of the C-terminal helix strand motif. When reduced Trx80 was applied to a G-50 Sephadex gel filtration column and chromatographed under reducing conditions, the protein eluted with the void volume and ahead of Trx (data not shown). However, Trx80 eluted at approximately 60% of the column volume on a calibrated Sephadex G-75 column, showing an apparent M r of 25,000 or double the size of Trx, which has a molecular weight of 12,000 (2Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The anomalous elution of Trx80 is compatible of a dimer in solution. Previous results showed that Trx80 as a fusion protein, in contrast to Trx, did not catalyze the reduction of insulin disulfides by DTT (28Silberstein D.S. McDonough S. Minkoff M.S. Balcewicz Sablinska M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9138-9142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our Trx80 was not a substrate for TrxR (Fig. 3). It also did not act as an inhibitor for reduction of oxidized Trx by TrxR (data not shown). We also tried to complement Trx80 with the C-terminal peptide of 24 residues of full-length Trx to examine whether this could restore any redox activity by noncovalent reconstitution (39Slaby I. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1340-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this was not the case (data not shown). Trx80 did not have any protein-disulfide isomerase-like activity in refolding of RNase when tested in an assay previously used to assess such activity (data not shown) (40Lundström J. Krause G. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9052-9407Google Scholar). When Trx was added to a mixture containing TrxR, NADPH, and oxidized Trx80 with three free SH groups, Trx80 was reduced by Trx (Fig. 3). This showed that Trx and Trx80 interact and that Trx can reduce disulfides in oxidized Trx80, whereas Trx80 itself lacks redox activity in all systems analyzed above. Knowing that Trx80 was homogeneous and devoid of detectable disulfide oxidoreductase activity, we wanted to analyze cytokine-like effects of the protein, and we chose normal human PBMC for this analysis. PBMC proliferation in RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum measured by optical density showed that 2.5 μg/ml phytohemaglutine A increased the cell number by 60% after 4 days in culture compared with 3 μm DTT alone. Trx80 at 1 μm indeed showed a stimulation of cell proliferation, with a significantly better effect than that of Trx84 (35% compared with 20% increase in cell number), whereas Trx alone showed no effect compared with DTT alone (data not shown). This finding made us continue with Trx80 for further analyses, and we switched to a serum-free synthetic AIM V medium with no fetal calf serum added, because Trx is known to be present in fetal calf serum (41Holmgren A. Luthman M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4071-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We confirmed the increase in cell number by an increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation after stimulation of PBMC with Trx80 using concentrations as low as 10 nm. The maximum thymidine incorporation was seen after 72 and 96 h of treatment. With 100 nm Trx80 there was a 10–15-fold increase in thymidine incorporation as compared with untreated cells. The effect of Trx80 increased dose-dependently up to 50–100 nm, after which the effect on cell proliferation was the same or even lower at higher Trx80. The stimulation of thymidine incorporation by 100 nm Trx80 was at the same level as that given by 5 units/ml of IL-2. In great contrast, Trx lacked PBMC-stimulating effects at concentrations up to 1 μm. These results are summarized in Fig.4. There were no synergy effects between IL-2 and Trx80/Trx or between Tr"

The C-terminal basic domain within residues 364–393 and the proline-rich domain within residues 64–91 are required for apoptotic activity. In addition, activation domain 2 within residues 43–63 is necessary for apoptotic activity when the N-terminal activation domain 1 within residues 1–42 is deleted (ΔAD1) or mutated (AD1−). Here we have discovered that an activation domain 2 mutation at residues 53–54 (AD2−) abrogates the apoptotic activity but has no significant effect on cell cycle arrest. We have also found that p53-(ΔAD2), which lacks activation domain 2, is inert in inducing apoptosis. p53-(AD2−ΔBD), which is defective in activation domain 2 and lacks the C-terminal basic domain, p53-(ΔAD2ΔBD), which lacks both activation domain 2 and the C-terminal basic domain, and p53-(ΔPRDΔBD), which lacks both the proline-rich domain and the C-terminal basic domain, are also inert in inducing apoptosis. All four mutants are still capable of inducing cell cycle arrest, albeit to a lesser extent than wild-type p53. Interestingly, we have found that deletion of the N-terminal activation domain 1 alleviates the requirement of the C-terminal basic domain for apoptotic activity. Thus, we have generated a small but potent p53-(ΔAD1ΔBD) molecule. Furthermore, we have determined that at least two of the three domains (activation domain 1, activation domain 2, and the proline-rich domain), are required for inducing cell cycle arrest. Taken together, our results suggest that activation domain 2 and the proline-rich domain form an activation domain for inducing pro-apoptotic genes or inhibiting anti-apoptotic genes.

Sabbatini P. White E. Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 887-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 17Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Zhu K. Chen X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2149-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Venot C. Maratrat M. Dureuil C. Conseiller E. Bracco L. Debussche L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4668-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In addition, the proline-rich domain plays an important role in the induction of several endogenous target genes, but is not required for activation of the exogenously introduced promoters of these target genes (17Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Zhu K. Chen X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2149-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the proline-rich domain may participate in the induction of cellular target gene(s) responsible for mediating apoptosis. However, the role of other p53 functional domains (especially the N-terminal activation domain 1 and the C-terminal basic domain) in apoptosis is still not certain. Earlier reports have shown that in some experimental protocols (19Caelles C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 370: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 20Wagner A.J. Kokontis J.M. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2817-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 21Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K.H. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) including our own (22Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), p53 transactivation activity is dispensable for apoptosis. It should be noted that this conclusion is based at least in part on the observation that an activation domain 1-deficient mutant (a double point mutation at residues 22–23, AD1−)1 is capable of inducing apoptosis (21Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K.H. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 22Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have shown that p53-(AD1−) contains an intact activation domain 2 (9Candau R. Scolnick D.M. Darpino P. Ying C.Y. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2405-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and therefore, p53-(AD1−) is still competent in transactivation (10Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when both activation domain 1 and activation domain 2 are mutated (a quadruple point mutation at residues 22–23 and 53–54, AD1−AD2−), the resulting protein is inert in transactivation and in inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (9Candau R.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2405-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The C-terminal basic domain has been subjected to extensive analysis, and all evidence suggests that the basic domain is a regulatory domain. This basic domain can regulate the DNA binding activity when it is phosphorylated (1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2288) Google Scholar, 5Giaccia A.J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the mechanism by which these latter peptides enhance p53 DNA binding activity is the ability of the peptides to interact with three separate domains in p53, that is, the proline-rich domain (30Muller-Tiemann B.F. Halazonetis T.D. Elting J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6079-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the DNA binding domain (31Selivanova G. Ryabchenko L. Jansson E. Iotsova V. Wiman K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3395-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the C-terminal basic domain (30Muller-Tiemann B.F. Halazonetis T.D. Elting J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6079-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 31Selivanova G. Ryabchenko L. Jansson E. Iotsova V. Wiman K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3395-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The C-terminal basic domain also interacts with several cellular proteins, such as TFIIH subunits XPB and XPD (32Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E. Forrester K. Xu G. Elmore L. Yeh H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 33Wang X.W.

Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), and Werner syndrome protein (WRN) (34Blander G. Kipnis J. Leal J.F., Yu, C.E. Schellenberg G.D. Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29463-29469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 35Spillare E.A. Robles A.I. Wang X.W. Shen J.C., Yu, C.E. Schellenberg G.D. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), which all lead to efficient induction of p53-mediated apoptosis. These results support a hypothesis that the C-terminal basic domain is a negative regulatory domain whose effect on the DNA binding activity can be alleviated by interacting with other cellular proteins, peptides derived from the p53 C terminus, or other modifications. However, several groups have shown that p53-(ΔBD), which lacks the C-terminal basic domain, has a reduced ability to induce several cellular target genes and becomes incapable of inducing apoptosis (22Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 32Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E. Forrester K. Xu G. Elmore L.

Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 843-848PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the C-terminal basic domain can regulate p53 activity both positively and negatively. In this study, we show that activation domain 2 and the proline-rich domain form an activation domain for inducing pro-apoptotic genes or inhibiting anti-apoptotic genes. The C-terminal basic domain is required for maintaining this activation domain competent for transactivation or transrepression. We also found that an activation domain capable of inducing at least partial cell cycle arrest can be formed by activation domain 1 plus activation domain 2, activation domain 1 plus the proline-rich domain, or activation domain 2 plus the proline-rich domain. The ability of these activation domains to induce cell cycle arrest can be enhanced by the presence of the C-terminal basic domain. Mutant p53 cDNA constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction, and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All p53 proteins were tagged at their N termini with an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) peptide recognizable by anti-HA antibody 12CA5. HA-tagged wild-type p53 was generated using 5′-end primer 5HA (GATCGAATTCACCATGGGCTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCC) and 3′-end primer C393 (GATCGAATTCTCAGTCTGAGTCAGGCCCTT). To generate p53-(AD2−), cDNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–59 and 60–393 were amplified independently and ligated through an internal AvaII site. The cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1–59 was amplified by 5′-end primer 5HA and 3′-end primer C59 (TTCATCTGGACCTGGGTCTTCAGTGCTCTGTTGTTCAATATC). The cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 60–393 was amplified by 5′-end primer N60 (ACTGAAGACCCAGGTCCA) and 3′-end primer C393. To generate p53-(ΔAD2), a cDNA fragment that encodes residues 41–393 but lacks residues 43–63 was amplified by 5′-end primer AD2 (TTGCAATGGATGATGCTCCCAGAATGCCAGA) and 3′-end primer C393. This fragment was then used to replace the HA-tagged wild-type p53 from residues 41–393 at a BsrD1 site. To generate p53-(ΔAD2ΔPRD), a cDNA fragment that encodes residues 41–393 but lacks residues 43–91 was amplified by 5′-end primer AP5 (TTGCAATGGATGATCCCCTGTCGTCTTCTGT) and 3′-end primer C393. This fragment was then used to replace the HA- tagged wild-type p53 from residues 41–393 at a BsrD1 site. p53-(ΔAD1), p53-(ΔPRD), p53-(ΔBD), p53-(ΔAD1AD2−), and p53-(ΔAD1ΔAD2) were generated as described previously (10Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Zhu K. Chen X.

To generate p53-(ΔAD1ΔPRD), p53-(ΔPRD) cDNA was amplified by 5′-end primer N43 (GATCGAATTCACCATGGGCTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTTTGATGCTGTCCCCG) and 3′-end primer C393. To generate p53-(AD2−ΔBD), p53-(ΔAD2ΔBD), p53-(ΔPRDΔBD), p53-(ΔAD1ΔBD), p53-(ΔAD1AD2−ΔBD), p53-(ΔAD1ΔPRDΔBD), p53-(ΔAD1ΔAD2ΔBD), and p53-(ΔAD2ΔPRDΔBD), the 3′-end cDNA fragments starting from the StuI site in p53-(AD2−), p53-(ΔAD2), p53-(ΔPRD), p53-(ΔAD1), p53-(ΔAD1AD2−), p53-(ΔAD1ΔPRD), p53-(ΔAD1ΔAD2), and p53-(ΔAD2ΔPRD) were replaced with the corresponding cDNA fragment in p53-(ΔBD). The above mutant p53 cDNAs were cloned separately into a tetracycline-regulated expression vector, pUHD10-3, at itsEcoRI site (37Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmids were used to generate cell lines that inducibly express p53. H1299 and MCF7 cell lines that express inducible proteins of interest were generated as described previously (10Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol.

The H1299 cell lines p53-3, p53-(R249S)-4, p53-(AD1−)-2, p53-(ΔBD)-1, p53-(ΔPRD)-5, and p53-(ΔAD1)-2 were as described previously (10Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol.

Growth rate analysis, trypan blue dye exclusion assay, and DNA histogram analysis were performed as described previously (10Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Zhu K. Chen X.

Propidium iodide and RNase A were purchased from Sigma. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled annexin V was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and staining was performed as described by the manufacturer. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.). Northern blot analysis was performed as described (10Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The p21,BAX, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes were prepared as described previously (10Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that the activity of activation domain 2 is required for inducing apoptosis when a double point mutation at residues 22–23 or deletion of the N-terminal 42 amino acid residues renders activation domain 1 dysfunctional (10Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To further determine the function of activation domain 2 in apoptosis, we generated an activation domain 2-deficient mutant, p53-(AD2−), which contains a double point mutation at residues 53–54. We then established several cell lines that inducibly express this mutant in p53-null H1299 lung carcinoma cells. Western blots from two representative cell lines, p53-(AD2−)-6 and -8, are shown in Fig. 1 A. After normalization to the levels of actin protein expressed, we found that the levels of p53 protein in p53-(AD2−)-6 and -8 cells were comparable with that in p53-3 and HA·p53-15 cells, which express wild-type p53 and HA-tagged wild-type p53, respectively (Fig. 1 A, upper two panels, compare lanes 5–8 with lanes 1–4). To determine the transcriptional activity of p53-(AD2−), we measured the level of p21 protein induced by p53-(AD2−). Surprisingly, we found that the ability of p53-(AD2−) to induce p21 was severely diminished (Fig. 1 A, p21 panel, lanes 5–8). These results are similar to that observed for the activation domain 1-deficient mutant (6Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 10Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). In contrast,p21 was strongly induced by wild-type p53 and HA-tagged wild-type p53 (Fig. 1 A, p21 panel, lanes 1–4). One of the hallmarks for p53 when overexpressed in cells is growth suppression (1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2288) Google Scholar, 2Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6727) Google Scholar, 3Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The HA-tagged wild-type p53 protein in HA·p53-15 cells, like the untagged wild-type p53 in p53-3 cells (10Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), inhibits cell proliferation (data not shown). To determine the activity of p53-(AD2−) in H1299 cells, the growth rate of p53-(AD2−)-6 cells was determined over a 5-day period. When induced to express p53-(AD2−), cells failed to multiply (Fig. 1 B), but visible microscopic cell death was not significantly increased (data not shown). Previously, several studies have shown that the C-terminal basic domain is necessary for inducing apoptosis but not cell cycle arrest (22Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 32Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E. Forrester K. Xu G. Elmore L. Yeh H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To determine whether this domain has any effect on the ability of p53-(AD2−) to induce growth suppression, we generated p53-(AD2−ΔBD), which is deficient in activation domain 2 and has a deletion of the C-terminal basic domain. We then established several cell lines that inducibly express p53-(AD2−ΔBD). Western blots from three representative cell lines, p53-(AD2−ΔBD)-2, -8, and -9, are shown in Fig. 1 A. We found that the levels of p53 in these cells were comparable with that in HA·p53-15 and p53-(ΔBD)-1 cells (Fig. 1 A, upper two panels, compare lanes 3–4 and 9–16). p53-(ΔBD)-1 cells are derived from H1299 cells that inducibly express p53-(ΔBD), which lacks the C-terminal basic domain (22Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Similarly, the transcriptional activity of p53-(AD2−ΔBD) was determined by measuring the level ofp21 induced. We found that, like p53-(AD2−), the ability of p53-(AD2−ΔBD) to induce p21was significantly diminished (Fig. 1 A, p21 panel, compare lanes 11–16 with lanes 1–4). In contrast, p21 was strongly induced by p53-(ΔBD) (Fig. 1 A, p21 panel, lanes 9–10), consistent with previous reports (22Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 32Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E. Forrester K. Xu G. Elmore L. Yeh H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, growth rate analysis showed that p53-(AD2−ΔBD) was still capable of inhibiting cell growth (Fig. 1 C), albeit to a lesser extent than p53-(AD2−) (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether the growth suppression by p53-(AD2−) is because of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and/or both, we performed a DNA histogram analysis and an annexin V staining assay. When induced to express the mutant p53-(AD2−) for three days, we found that the percentage of cells in S phase decreased from 35 to 8% whereas cells in G1 increased from 49 to 75%, suggesting that p53-(AD2−) arrested cells primarily in G1 (Fig. 1, D–E). However, no apparent apoptosis was detected by either DNA histogram analysis (Fig. 1,D–E) or annexin V staining (Fig. 1, F–G). Thus, the activity in activation domain 2 is necessary for inducing apoptosis. As a positive control, we analyzed p53-3 and HA·p53-15 cells. When induced to express wild-type or HA-tagged p53 for three days, we found that both p53-producing cells were arrested primarily in G1 and underwent apoptosis, consistent with previous reports (10Zhu J. Zhou W. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13030-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 22Chen X. Ko L.J. Jayaraman L. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2438-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). We also analyzed p53-(AD2−ΔBD)-9 cells. We found that no significant apoptosis was observed, and cells primarily arrested in G1 when induced to express p53-(AD2−ΔBD) (data not shown). To determine the activity of the entire activation domain 2 (residues 43–62), we generated p53-(ΔAD2), which lacks the entire activation domain 2 and p53-(ΔAD2ΔBD), which in turn lacks activation domain 2 and the C-terminal basic domain. We then established several cell lines that inducibly express p53-(ΔAD2) and p53-(ΔAD2ΔBD), respectively (Fig. 2, A and C). We found that p53-(ΔAD2) and p53-(ΔAD2ΔBD) suppressed cell proliferation (Fig. 2, B and D), albeit to a lesser extent than p53-(AD2−) and p53-(AD2−ΔBD) (Fig. 1, B and C). Furthermore, we found that cells were arrested primarily in G1 but did not undergo apoptosis when induced to express these p53 mutants (data not shown, TableI). However, we found that p21was not significantly induced (Fig. 2, A and C), suggesting that p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in G1 can be mediated by a gene(s) other thanp21.Figure 2The activity for cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis was partially retained in p53-(ΔAD2), p53-(ΔAD2Δ BD ), and p53-(Δ PRD Δ BD ). A, C, and E, levels of p53, p21, and actin were assayed by Western blot analysis in cell lines as shown in the absence (−) or presence (+) of p53 for 24 h.

https://openalex.org/W1989896377,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) induces survival and differentiation of the neural crest-derived PC12 cell line. Caveolae are cholesterol-enriched, caveolin-containing plasma membrane microdomains involved in vesicular transport and signal transduction. Here we demonstrate the presence of caveolae in PC12 cells and their involvement in NGF signaling. Our results showed the expression of caveolin-1 by Western blot and confocal immuno-microscopy. The presence of plasma membrane caveolae was directly shown by rapid-freeze deep-etching electron microscopy. Moreover, combined deep-etching and immunogold techniques revealed the presence of the NGF receptor TrkA in the caveolae of PC12 cells. These data together with the cofractionation of Shc, Ras, caveolin, and TrkA in the caveolae fraction supported a role for these plasma membrane microdomains in NGF signaling. To approach this hypothesis, caveolae were disrupted by treatment of PC12 cells with cholesterol binding drugs. Either filipin or cyclodextrin treatment increased basal levels of MAPK phosphorylation. In contrast, pretreatment of PC12 cells with these drugs inhibited the NGF- but not the epidermal growth factor-induced MAPK phosphorylation without affecting the TrkA autophosphorylation. Taken together, our results demonstrate the presence of caveolae in PC12 cells, which contain the high affinity NGF receptor TrkA, and the specific involvement of these cholesterol-enriched plasma membrane microdomains in the propagation of the NGF-induced signal.

Although initially described by Palade (1Palade G.E. J. Appl. Physics. 1953; 24: 1424Google Scholar) and Yamada (2Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) as small caves in the plasma membrane of endothelial and epithelial cells, caveolae have been found in many other cell types including adipocytes, muscle cells, fibroblasts, astrocytes, pneumocytes, and hepatocytes. The presence of caveolin and the enrichment in cholesterol are the two main molecular hallmarks of caveolae. Thus, 80–90% of the plasma membrane cholesterol is concentrated in caveolae and contributes to the characteristic low buoyant density and detergent insolubility of these plasma membrane microdomains (3Parton R.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 4Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). A family of caveolin proteins including caveolin-1 α and β forms, caveolin-2, and caveolin-3 has been described (5Glenney J.R.J. Soppet D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10517-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 6Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Caveolins are highly hydrophobic proteins with a characteristic hairpin shape located inside the plasma membrane, with both ends facing the cytoplasm. The N-terminal domain of the protein mediates homo- and hetero-oligomerization of the caveolin monomers as well as its binding to different molecules (8Lisanti M.P. Tang Z.L. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.S. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Caveolae were thought to be mainly involved in transport of molecules across the cell. Thus, transcytosis and potocytosis were described as mediated by caveolae in endothelial cells (12Anderson R.G. Kamen B.A. Rothberg K.G. Lacey S.W. Science. 1992; 255: 410-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 13Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J.

In fact, caveolae were found to carry the molecular machinery required for vesicular transport (15Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Science. 1996; 274: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar,16Scheiffele P. Verkade P. Fra A.M. Virta H. Simons K. Ikonen E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 795-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, the presence of caveolin-associated preassembled signaling complexes, including membrane receptors and downstream signal-transducing molecules, supports a role for these plasma membrane microdomains not only in transport but also in signal transduction (4Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar,17Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar). NGF1 is the prototypic member of the neurotrophin family of neurotrophic factors, which also includes brain-derived neurotrophic factor, NT3, and NT4/5 (18Levi-Montalcini R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1145-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 19Lewin G.R. Barde Y.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Two kinds of membrane receptors mediate neurotrophin signaling: theTrk family of tyrosine kinase receptors, including TrkA,TrkB, and TrkC, showing specific high affinity for NGF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor/NT4, and NT3, respectively, and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NR), with similar low affinity for all (20Barbacid M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 21Chao M. Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Carter B. Chittka A. Kong H. Yoon S.O. Brain Res. Brain Res.

Survival, differentiation, proliferation, or cell death may be induced by neurotrophins, depending on the specific background and physiological state of a cell. PC12 cells, derived from a pheochromatocytoma tumor of rat adrenal medulla (23Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4803) Google Scholar), which express both TrkA and p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NR), have been extensively used to study the NGF action. Undifferentiated, round-shaped PC12 cells grow exponentially in high serum conditions; in response to NGF they stop growing, extend neurites, and differentiate into cholinergic sympathetic-like neurons (23Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4803) Google Scholar). Moreover, NGF treatment could induce survival or cell death of serum-deprived PC12 cells, depending on the relative amounts of TrkA and p75, respectively (24Barrett G.L. Georgiou A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Taglialatela G. Robinson R. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To study the putative involvement of caveolae in NGF signaling, we have analyzed the presence of these plasma membrane microdomains in PC12 cells. Our results showed the expression of caveolin-1 together with the presence of prototypic caveolae clustered in specific membrane subdomains. Moreover, the presence of the high affinity NGF receptor TrkA in caveolae supported their putative involvement in NGF signaling. Finally, we show that drug-induced disruption of caveolae inhibits NGF-induced, but not EGF-induced, MAPK phosphorylation, with no effect on the NGF-induced TrkA autophosphorylation. A role for caveolae in cellular compartmentalization of signal transduction in PC12 cells is discussed. Two polyclonal antibodies produced against TrkA were used: RTA raised against the extracellular domain of rat TrkA (26Clary D.O. Weskamp G. Austin L.R. Reichardt L.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 549-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and a pan-trk antibody (α−203) raised against the 14 C-terminal amino acids of human TrkA (27Martin-Zanca D. Oskam R. Mitra G. Copeland T. Barbacid M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Three antibodies raised against the N-terminal domain of caveolin-1, a polyclonal (cavp) and two monoclonals, clones C060 and 2234, and a polyclonal antibody against Shc, all of them from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), were used. A monoclonal antibody, 4G10, directed against phosphorylated tyrosine and a monoclonal antibody against pan-Ras were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal antibodies against ERK-1 and ERK-2 were from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Polyclonal antibodies against phospho-ERK-1 and phospho-ERK-2 were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit and anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse and anti-rabbit were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit and rabbit anti-mouse were obtained from Bio-Rad. Goat anti-mouse conjugated to 10- or 15-nm colloidal gold and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10- or 15-nm colloidal gold were from BioCell. NGF was purified from salivary glands as described previously (28Mobley W.C. Schenker A. Shooter E.M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5543-5552Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were obtained from Dr. F. McKenzie (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf and 10% horse serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 56 units/ml penicillin, and 56 μg/ml streptomycin. For cell treatment, PC12 cells, around 4 weeks after thawing, were grown to 70% confluence and serum-deprived for 16–18 h. Cells were then stimulated for 5 min with NGF (100 ng/ml) or EGF (10 ng/ml). For drug treatments, PC12 cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of either vehicle alone or one of the following drugs: 10 mm β-hydroxypropyl cyclodextrin, 5 μg/ml filipin, or 5 μg/ml xylazine (Sigma). Reversibility of drug effects were achieved as follows: for filipin-treated cells, incubating with normal media for 1 h; for cyclodextrin-treated cells, with 16 μg/ml cholesterol and 0.4% cyclodextrin in normal culture media for 1 h (29Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To obtain lysates, cells were quickly rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, and lysis was performed at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100 containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmaprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate) or buffer B (buffer A containing 60 mm octylglucoside). After 45 min of incubation on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 30 min. Total cell extracts were obtained with buffer C (67 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 2% SDS). Protein was quantified by Bradford or Lowry assay reagents (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot. Cells were lysed in buffer B, and 400–2000 μg of protein in 1 ml were used for immunoprecipitation studies. 4 μg of rabbit anti-caveolin or mouse (clone 2234) anti-caveolin was used to immunoprecipitate caveolin. Pan-trk (α-203) or anti-TrkA (RTA) antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate TrkA. Immunoprecipitation was performed at 4 °C for 3 h. Protein immunocomplexes were incubated with 20 μl of bovine serum albumin-blocked protein A-Sepharose (50% suspension in lysis buffer) for 1 h at 4 °C, collected by a short centrifugation (30 s), and washed five times in buffer B. Samples for electrophoresis were solubilized with Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE using either 10 or 12.5% acrylamide. For Western blot, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P strips for 2 h at 60 V, blocked with 5% dried milk (except for the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10, which was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin) in Tris-buffered saline, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies (anti-caveolin-1 polyclonal 1:3000; RTA 1:500; anti-ERK-1 and ERK-2 1:500; anti-phospho-ERK-1 and ERK-2 1:500; anti-phosphorylated tyrosine 4G10 1:1000; anti-Shc 1:500; anti-pan-Ras 1:100) diluted in blocking solution. After three washes in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with peroxidase diluted 1:2000 in blocking solution. Developing was performed with the ECL kit. PC12 cells were plated on tissue culture dishes containing sterile glass coverslips coated with collagen and poly-ornitin. Cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed for 30 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then blocked with fetal calf serum (1%) in PBS-Gly for 30 min and incubated with the first antibody diluted in blocking solution. Dilutions used were 1:150 for anti-caveolin (polyclonal or monoclonal) and 1:500 for anti-TrkA (RTA or α−203). The incubation was carried out in a humidified chamber at 37 °C for 45 min. Three washes in PBS were performed to remove excess antibody before adding the secondary fluorescent-conjugated antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Mowiol. Confocal images were collected using a Leica TCS NT equipped with a 63× Leitz Plan-Apo objective, NA 1.4. Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) was used for image processing. PC12 cells grown to confluence in 150-mm diameter dishes were used to obtain caveolin-enriched membrane fractions essentially as described (30Song S.K. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Cyclodextrin-treated or untreated cells were used. After two washes in ice-cold PBS, PC12 cells from a confluent 150-mm flask were scraped in 0.5 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0, transferred to a plastic tub, and homogenized in two steps using a 0.9 × 40 needle and a ultrasound bath (5 min.). The homogenate was adjusted to 45% sucrose by the addition of 0.5 ml of 90% sucrose prepared in MBS (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl) and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5–35% discontinuous sucrose gradient (w/v) was formed above (0.6 ml of 5% sucrose, 2.4 ml of 35% sucrose; both in MBS containing 250 mm sodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 36,000 rpm for 7 h at 4 °C in an TI50 rotor. Sucrose gradient fractions (450 μl) were collected from the top of the ultracentrifuge tubes and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Rapid freezing and freeze-substitution PC12 cells were grown on transwell filters to facilitate further sectioning. Small pieces of the filters were cryo-fixed by projection against a copper block cooled in liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) using a Cryoblock (Leica) as described (31Escaig J. J. Microsc. (Oxford ). 1982; 126: 221-229Crossref Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Freeze-substitution was performed in a homemade cryo system (32Quintana C. Micron. 1994; 25: 63-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using acetone containing 0.5% of uranyl acetate for 3 days at −90 °C. On day 4 the temperature was slowly increased, 5 °C/h, to −50 °C. At this temperature samples were rinsed in acetone and then infiltrated and embedded in Lowicryl HM20 as follows: 50% Lowicryl 32 in acetone for 4 h; 75% Lowicryl in acetone overnight; 100% Lowicryl overnight and 100% fresh resin for 4 h. After infiltration, resin blocks were prepared and polymerized using UV light. Ultrathin sections were picked up on Formvar-coated gold grids in order to carry out the immunocytochemical labeling; samples were blocked with 2% ovalbumin for 30 min and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with rabbit anti-pan-trk antibody (α-203, 1:500) and mouse anti-caveolin-1 antibody (C060, 1:150). Washes were performed to remove excess antibody with PBS before adding goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 15- and 10-nm colloidal gold, respectively, for 45 min at room temperature. Finally, samples were washed and contrasted with 2% uranyl acetate. PC12 cells were grown to confluence on tissue culture dishes containing 8–12 sterile glass coverslips coated with collagen and poly-ornitin. Upper plasma membrane was removed by sonication (1-s burst) in an isotonic buffer that contained 70 mm KCl, 3 mm EGTA, 30 mm HEPES, and 5 mm MgCl2 after a hypotonic shock in a 1/3 solution of isotonic buffer for 1 min. Coverslips were immediately fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde in cold PBS, pH 7.4, then blocked with 10% fetal calf serum for 30 min and incubated with rabbit pan-trk (1:500) and mouse anti-caveolin-1 (1:150) antibodies. The incubation was carried out at room temperature for 45 min. Three washes were performed to remove excess antibody before adding goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10- and 15-nm colloidal gold, respectively, for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde before processing, as indicated below for rapid-freezing and deep-etching electron microscopy. Briefly, coverslips were cut into 2–3-mm squares and cryo-fixed by projection against a copper block cooled in liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) using a Cryoblock (Reichert-Jung, Leica). The frozen samples were stored at −70 °C until use. Samples were etched and coated with platinum and carbon using a freeze-etching unit (model BAF-060, BAL-TEC; Liechtenstein). A rotatory replica of the exposed surface was prepared by evaporating 1-nm platinum-carbon at an angle of 24° above the horizontal, followed by 10 nm of carbon evaporated at a 75° angle (33Heuser J.E. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The replica was separated from the coverslip by immersion in full-strength hydrofluoric acid, washed twice in distilled water, and digested with 5% sodium hypochlorite for 5–10 min. Finally, the replicas were washed several times in distilled water, broken into small pieces, and picked up on Formvar-coated copper grids for electron microscopy. When immunolabeling was carried out, the replicas were only washed in distilled water. All electron micrographs were obtained using an electron microscope Hitachi HU-600, operating at 75 kV. The photographic negatives were digitalized without contrast-reversing and treated by the IMAT program (Alejandro DiGiorgio, Serveis Cientı́fico Tècnics, Universitat de Barcelona). Confocal microscopy analyses were performed in paraformaldehyde-fixed PC12 cells with a monoclonal and a polyclonal antibody, both raised against the N-terminal domain of caveolin-1 (Fig.1 A). The polyclonal antibody has been shown to recognize all known members of the caveolin family, whereas the monoclonal (C060) recognizes only α and β isoforms of caveolin-1. Our immunofluorescence results showed different patterns of staining with the two antibodies: the polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 (a) revealed a general and punctate distribution of caveolin in asynchronic proliferating wild-type PC12 cells, whereas the monoclonal (b) showed a more restricted plasma membrane distribution of the caveolin immunoreactivity.Figure 1Wild-type PC12 cells express caveolin-1. A, confocal microscopy showing caveolin-1 expression in proliferating PC12 cells. Immunocytochemistry was performed with polyclonal (a) and monoclonal (b) anti-caveolin-1 antibodies. Note the general and diffuse signal distribution revealed by the polyclonal antibody in contrast to the more membrane-restricted pattern shown by the monoclonal antibody. Bar, 5 μm.B, Western blot analysis of caveolin expression with the polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody. The left panel shows total cell lysates from Swiss3T3, NIH3T3, and normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, obtained with the SDS-containing buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”). The panel in the middle shows different soluble (S) and insoluble (P) pools of caveolin-1 obtained from PC12 cells using Triton X-100 (S1/P1) or octylglucoside (S2/P2)-containing buffers (see “Experimental Procedures”). The panel on the right shows Western blot analyses using the polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody (cavp) after immunoprecipitation (Ip) with the same antibody or the monoclonal 2234 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Western blot analysis with the polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody revealed a major protein band with an apparent electrophoretic mobility of around 25 kDa in total cell extracts of Swiss3T3, NIH3T3, and normal rat kidney cells. In contrast, none of the two monoclonal antibodies against caveolin-1, 2234 and C060, revealed any immunoreactive band when used in Western blot (not shown). Because of the characteristic Triton X-100 insolubility of the oligomeric caveolin (10Monier S. Parton R.G. Vogel F. Behlke J. Henske A. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 911-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), two lysis buffers containing either Triton X-100 or Triton X-100 and octylglucoside were used. Caveolin immunoreactivity was partially solubilized (around 50%) by 1% Triton X-100, and almost all caveolin was solubilized by a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 plus 60 mm octylglucoside, supporting the presence of two different pools of caveolin in PC12 cells. Other higher molecular weight caveolin-1 immunoreactive bands, probably revealing SDS-resistant caveolin oligomers and/or other caveolin-like proteins, were also observed when films were overexposed (not shown). Specificity of the 25-kDa band was assessed by combining immunoprecipitation and Western blots. Immunoprecipitation with anti-caveolin-1, either monoclonal (2234) or polyclonal, antibodies followed by Western blot with the polyclonal revealed only the 25-kDa band (Fig. 1 B). Rapid-freeze deep-etching electron microscopy, which revealed the internal face of the basal plasma membrane, was performed in PC12 cells. Electron microscopy analysis showed different plasma membrane invaginations: clathrin-coated pits and caveolae. Although relatively smaller, between 100–200 nm in diameter, than the prototypic clathrin-coated pits, the characteristic basket-like structure of the clathrin coat was clearly seen (Fig.2 A). Other smaller invaginations, around 50–100 nm in diameter, that showed the characteristic striated coat of caveolae were also observed (Fig.2 B). Combined rapid-freeze deep etching and immunogold techniques using the polyclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody revealed the presence of caveolin in caveolae-like membrane invaginations and, also, outside the caveolae (Fig. 2 C). Caveolin immunoreactivity, however, was completely absent from the clathrin-coated pit-enriched areas. Moreover, clathrin-coated pits and prototypic caveolae were not interspersed in the plasma membrane but mainly distributed in different plasma membrane subdomains (Fig. 2, A and B). Double immunofluorescence was performed with polyclonal panTrk (α−203) or the TrkA-specific RTA antibodies and a monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 antibody (C060) on PC12 cells grown on collagen- and polyornitine-coated coverslides. Confocal microscopy analysis showed colocalization of TrkA and caveolin at the plasma membrane in proliferating PC12 cells (Fig.3 A). Double-immunogold analysis with the polyclonal anti-pan-trk antibody (α-203) and the monoclonal anti-caveolin-1 (C060) were performed on Lowicryl with ultrathin sections of exponentially growing PC12 cells and in rapid-freeze deep-etched material. Electron microscopic data showed the presence of TrkA in prototypic caveolae (Fig.3 B). Moreover, post-embedding double-immunogold labeling of Lowicryl sections showed typical bottle-shaped membrane invaginations of 50–100 nm in diameter containing both TrkA (10-nm gold particle) and caveolin-1 (15-nm gold particle) immunoreactivity. In contrast, the electron microscopy data did not show TrkA immunoreactivity in clathrin-enriched plasma membrane domains (Fig. 3 B). PC12 cells were treated with cholesterol binding drugs. Confocal microscopy showed that treatment with cyclodextrin (known to remove cholesterol), in contrast to filipin or xylazine, increased caveolin immunoreactivity in the perinuclear area of PC12 cells (Fig.4 A). Detergent-free cell membrane fractionation of cyclodextrin-treated or untreated cells was performed. Western blot analysis showed TrkA, caveolin, Shc, and Ras cofractioning in the upper fractions of the sucrose gradient interface between 5–35% sucrose (fractions 2 and 3) in untreated PC12 cells. Cyclodextrin treatment and, thus, cholesterol depletion of the cells caused a shift to higher bouyant density of membranes containing TrkA, caveolin, Shc, or Ras proteins (Fig. 4 B). Stimulation of PC12 cells with NGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min induced a significant increase of MAPK phosphorylation. Two cholesterol binding drugs known to functionally disrupt caveolae, filipin, and cyclodextrin were used to evaluate the putative involvement of cholesterol-sensitive structures such as caveolae in NGF signaling. Xylazine, a general lipid binding drug that does not show specific affinity for cholesterol was used as a control. Filipin and cyclodextrin slightly increased basal MAPK phosphorylation levels in PC12 cells (not shown, only detected in overexposed films). However, pretreatment of PC12 cells with either cyclodextrin or filipin, but not with xylazine, inhibited NGF-induced MAPK phosphorylation. Levels of solubilized MAPK in cell lysates from drug-treated or untreated cells were not altered. Drug effects were reversed, incubating PC12 cells with cyclodextrin-cholesterol (for cyclodextrin-treated cells) or with normal media (for filipin) (Fig.5 A). NGF-induced phosphorylation of TrkA was unaltered by any of the cholesterol binding drug treatments (Fig. 5 B) with respect to the control (xylazine). In contrast to NGF, the EGF-induced MAPK phosphorylation was unmodified by pretreatment with any of the drugs (Fig.5 C). The aims of the present study were to show the presence of caveolae in PC12 cells and to analyze its putative involvement in NGF signaling. Both the expression of caveolin-1 and the presence of plasma membrane caveolae microdomains have been shown in wild-type-proliferating PC12 cells. A putative involvement of caveolae in NGF signaling was supported by the presence of TrkA, the high affinity NGF receptor, together with other signaling intermediaries such as Shc and Ras in caveolae. Functional experiments, in which the integrity of caveolae was disrupted by pretreatment with the cholesterol binding drugs filipin or cyclodextrin, showed the specific involvement of these cholesterol-enriched plasma membrane microdomains in the propagation of NGF-induced signal. Taken together our data support a role for caveolae in specific compartmentalization of signal transduction in PC12 cells. Three methodological aspects have to be taken into account for the discussion of the results presented h"
https://openalex.org/W2080379916,"Smads, the intracellular effectors of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members, are somatically mutated at high frequency in particular types of human cancers. Certain of these mutations affect the Smad amino-terminal domain, which, in the case of Smad3 and Smad4, binds DNA. We investigated the functional consequences of four missense mutations in the Smad4 amino-terminal domain found in human tumors. The mutant proteins were found to have impaired abilities to bind DNA although they were fully capable of forming complexes with Smad3. All four Smad4 mutants showed decreased protein stability compared to wild-type Smad4. Two of the Smad4 mutants (G65V and P130S) were translocated to the nucleus and were capable of transactivating a Smad-dependent promoter in a ligand-dependent manner. In contrast, the L43S and R100T mutants were not translocated efficiently to the nucleus and consequently resulted in severely defective transcriptional responses to TGF-beta. Moreover, we demonstrate here the critical importance of two basic residues in the beta-hairpin loop of Smad3 or Smad4 for DNA binding, consistent with predictions from the Smad3 crystal structure. In addition, our results reveal that in the TGF-beta-induced heteromeric signaling complex, loss of DNA binding of Smad4 can be compensated by Smad3, however, both Smad3 and Smad4 are needed for efficient DNA binding and signaling. In conclusion, mutations in the amino-terminal domain of Smad4, that are found in cancer, show loss of multiple functional properties which may contribute to tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2331825045,"Insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) are secreted into the extra-cellular matrix and inhibit cell growth through IGF-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the role of IGFBP-6, a relatively unexplored member of the IGFBP family, in the proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Infection of NSCLC cell lines in vitro with an adenovirus expressing human IGFBP-6 under the control of a CMV promoter (Ad5CMV-BP6) reduced NSCLC cell number through activation of programmed cell death, as shown by cell staining with Hoechst 33342 or DNA end-labeling with bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate. The growth regulatory effect of IGFBP-6 was investigated in vivo by intratumoral injection of Ad5CMV-BP6 in NSCLC xenografts established in nu/nu mice. A single injection of Ad5CMV-BP6 reduced the size of NSCLC xenografts by 45%. These findings indicate that IGFBP-6 is a potent inducer of programmed cell death in cancer cells and support investigations into IGFBP-6 as a potential target in cancer therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W2149755295,"Hepatopoietin (HPO) is a novel human hepatotrophic growth factor, which specifically stimulates proliferation of cultured primary hepatocytes in vitro and liver regeneration after liver partial hepatectomy in vivo. Recently, the identification of the mitogenic effect of HPO on hepatoma cell lines and the existence of HPO-specific receptors indicate that HPO acts via its specific cell surface receptor. However, the molecular mechanism of HPO action is not fully elucidated. In this report, we examined the signal transduction events induced by HPO in hepatoma cell line (HepG2). Our results demonstrated that HPO induces phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in a rapid and transient manner. HPO stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Furthermore, we observed that both MAPK activation and the mitogenic effect of HPO on HepG2 cells were completely blocked by AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. However, the effects of HPO were not antagonized by an EGFR-blocking antibody, mAb528, which blocks the interaction between epidermal growth factor and EGFR, indicating that stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR by HPO was not mediated by epidermal growth factor. In contrast, genistein, a general tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in response to HPO.

Wu C. Chin. Sci. Bull. 1997; 42: 1505-1511Crossref Google Scholar). In 1975, LaBrecque and Pesh (2LaBrecque D.R. Pesh L.A. J. Physiol. 1975; 248: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) first reported that in the livers of weanling rats or partially hepatectomized rats, there existed a polypeptide, named hepatic stimulator substance, that could specifically stimulate DNA synthesis of hepatic cells. The existence of hepatic stimulator substance-related activities has been reported in other species including mice, cows, dogs, pigs, and humans (3LaBrecque D.R. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1994; 89 (suppl.): 90-96Google Scholar). Hagiya et al. (4Hagiya M. Francavilla A. Polimeno L. Ihara I. Sakai H. Seki T. Shimonishi M. Porter K.A. Starzl T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8142-8146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) cloned the cDNA of rat augmenter of liver regeneration, which is the same as rat hepatic stimulator substance. Subsequently, Giorda et al. (5Giorda R. Hagiya M. Seki T. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 97-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Yang et al. (6Yang X.M. Xie L. Qiu Z.H. Wu C. He F.C. Sci. China Ser. C Life Sci. 1997; 6: 642-647Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) cloned the cDNA of human augmenter of liver regeneration or HPO by screening the cDNA library of human fetal liver. HPO encodes a novel protein with no sequence similarity to any known growth regulator. Interestingly, HPO is highly related to the yeast ERV (essential for respiration and viability) gene products. However, the functional relevance of HPO and ERV is currently unclear (7Lisowsky T. Weinstat-Saslow D.L. Barton N. Reeders S.T. Schneider M.C. Genomics. 1995; 29: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Yang et al. (8,9) demonstrated that the recombinant human HPO stimulated proliferation of hepatocytes as well as hepatoma cells in vitro. HPO also promotes regeneration and recovery of damaged hepatocytes and rescues acute hepatic failurein vivo (8Yang X.M. Hu Z.Y. Xie L. Wu C. He F.C. Acta Physiol. Sin. 1997; 49: 557-561PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yang X.M Xie L. He H. Wei H.D. He F.C. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 1997; 29: 72-77Google Scholar). Thus, these observations support the contention that HPO is a hepatotrophic growth factor. Unlike other typical growth factors, HPO was discovered in the cytosol of liver parenchymal cells and was produced in an autocrined way (rather than in a paracrined way from mesenchymal cells or in an endocrined way from other glands) during liver regeneration or organogenesis (10LaBrecque D.R. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1991; 36: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, the effects of HPO are known to be liver-specific. HPO specifically stimulates proliferation of cultured primary hepatocytes in vitro and enhances liver regeneration after liver partial hepatectomy in vivo. HPO displays no significant effect on the proliferation of non-hepatocytes or tumor cell lines derived from tissues other than liver (10LaBrecque D.R. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1991; 36: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These unique characteristics distinguish HPO from various well known hepatic stimulators, such as insulin, epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and transformation growth factor (TGF-α), which can stimulate proliferation of a wide variety of cell types (11Fausto N. Lairo A.D. Webber E.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1527-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Because of the very specific effect of HPO, the mechanism of HPO action might be intriguing and different from other known growth factors. Recently, we characterized the mitogenic effect of HPO on hepatoma cell lines and demonstrated the existence of HPO receptors on the membranes of these cells (12Wang G. Yang X.M. Zhang Y. Wang Q.M. Chen H.P. Wei H.D. Xing G.C. Xie L. Hu Z.Y. Zhang C.G. Fang D.C. Wu C. He F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11469-11472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we showed that HPO acts as an autocrine growth factor to maintain the autonomous growth of hepatoma cell lines in vitro. These findings suggest that HPO binds a specific receptor on the cell membrane and triggers the signal transduction pathway leading to cell proliferation. Considering the importance of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in cell growth, we investigated activation of the MAPK pathway by HPO. EGF is also an important growth factor in liver regeneration (13Michalopoulos G.K. Defrances M. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2874) Google Scholar) and hepatoma progression in vivo (14Yamaguchi K. Carr B.I. Nalesnik M.A. J. Surg. Oncol. 1995; 58: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The autocrine loop of TGF-α/EGFR plays an important role in supporting autonomous growth of hepatoma cells in vitro (15Yang E.B. Wang D.F. Mack P. Cheng L.Y. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1996; 38: 813-820PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to activation by its ligands, such as EGF and TGF-α, EGFR could act as a downstream mediator in various signaling pathways via a novel ligand-independent pathway. In some tumor cell lines, EGFR is essential for a wide variety of mitogens to stimulate the MAPK pathway and cell proliferation (16Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that EGFR might play an important role for the mitogenic signaling triggered by HPO in hepatoma cell lines. HepG2 (a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line) and GLC-82 (a lung cancer cell line) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone). HPO open reading frame (375 base pairs) (6Yang X.M. Xie L. Qiu Z.H. Wu C. He F.C. Sci. China Ser. C Life Sci. 1997; 6: 642-647Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was subcloned into expression vector pBV220 to create vector pBV220-HPO. The vector containing HPO cDNA was transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM109. A single colony of JM109 containing pBV220-HPO to LB (5 ml) was seeded and cultured overnight at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. The culture was diluted 2:100 into fresh LB and incubated for 3 h at 30 °C; then expression of HPO protein was induced by heating (42 °C, 5 h). The bacteria cells were collected by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 10 min) and lysated with a sonicator. The sonicated cells were spun at 10,000 × g for 5 min; then the supernatant was discarded, and the inclusion body pellet was washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5% Triton X-100, 4m urea. The washed inclusion bodies were dissolved in solubilization buffer (8 m urea, 1 mm EDTA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was diluted to the protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. 5 ml of supernatant of the sample was loaded on the Superdex 75 prep grade 26/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the solubilization buffer. The column was eluted at 2 ml/min. The purity of the proteins of peak II was analyzed by silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified protein was refolded by dilution in refolding buffer (1 mm reduced glutathione, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The refolded protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) completely; then the solution was spun at 10,000 × gfor 20 min, and the supernatant was collected. EGF, IGF-1, tyrphostin AG1478, and genistein were from Sigma. Antibodies against active MAP kinase and pan-extracellular signal-regulated kinase were from Promega Corporation. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. EGFR, IGF-1 receptor, and HGF receptor antibodies and Protein A/G-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody mAb528 was from NeoMarkers. Phospho-tyrosine monoclonal antibody P-Tyr-100 was from BioLabs. Enhanced Chemiluminescense (ECL) kit and Hybond-P membrane were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodiumo-vanadate, 20 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin for 20 min at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. For detecting HGF receptor, IGF-1 receptor, and EGFR, the supernatant was collected and used in Western blot directly. For detecting the phospho-EGFR, the supernatant was incubated with anti-EGFR antibody for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with Protein A-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed by radioimmune precipitation buffer three times. The lysate or immunoprecipitate was fractionated via 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were blotted onto Hybond-P membranes. The membranes were first blocked by incubation in TTBS containing 3% BSA overnight at 4 °C, then incubated sequentially with primary antibody and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and detected using an ECL kit. Finally, the various Western blotting bands were scanned by GS-710 calibrated imaging densitometer (Bio-Rad) and analyzed by Quantity OneTMsoftware (Bio-Rad, PhotoShop 4.0). Activation of the MAPK pathway is a key event in cell growth regulation. Both MEK and MAPK are activated by phosphorylation of conserved residues in the activation loop of the kinase domains. Activities of endogenous MEK and MAPK can be indirectly determined by Western blot with phosphospecific antibodies. We tested whether MAPK is stimulated in HepG2 cells by HPO. Fig. 1 indicates that HPO induces phosphorylation of MEK and MAPK in serum-starved HepG2 cells. The increase of phosphorylation appeared in a rapid and transient manner. MEK phosphorylation was at a maximum 5 min after HPO treatment and declined to the basal level at 30 min. Similarly, phosphorylation of MAPK reached the peak at 10 min and dropped to the basal level at 30 min after HPO stimulation. The kinetics of MEK and MAPK induced by HPO is very similar to those activated by other growth factors (17Chaudhary L.R. Avioli L.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Dabrowski A. Groblewski G.E. Scher C. Guan K.L. Williams D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G1472-G1479Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The above data demonstrate that HPO activates the MAPK signaling pathway in HepG2 cells. EGFR is activated not only by EGF but also by a wide variety of mitogens. We examined whether HPO stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, HPO induces tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR but has no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of HGF receptor (c-MET) nor on IGF-1 receptor. The kinetics of HPO action on the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR parallels that of the phosphorylation of MEK and MAPK, suggesting that phosphorylation of EGFR may play a role in the activation of MEK and MAPK in response to HPO. The level of phosphorylated EGFR induced by HPO is approximately one-third of that induced by EGF (Fig.2 B). The specificity of phosphorylation of EGFR triggered by HPO is demonstrated by the observation that only HPO and EGF, but neither HGF nor IGF-1, stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig.2 A). To determine the significance of EGFR in HPO signaling, the effect of tyrphostin AG1478 was tested on MAPK activation by HPO. Tyrphostin AG1478 is a specific inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity (19Levitki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). Fig. 3indicates that the MAPK activation triggered by both HPO and EGF were completely blocked by AG1478. In contrast, IGF-1-induced MAPK activation was not unaffected. Furthermore, the effect of HPO is more sensitive to the AG1478 than is the effect of EGF (data not shown). This could be due to the fact that EGF induced a much stronger activation of EGFR than did HPO (Fig. 2 A). Our data show that EGFR is a prerequisite of the HPO signaling cascade leading to MAPK activation and that the role of EGFR in HPO signaling depends on its intrinsic AG1478-sensitive tyrosine kinase activity.Figure 1Activation of MEK and MAPK by HPO. HepG2 cells were cultured without serum for 24 h prior to stimulation with 50 ng/ml recombinant human HPO for the indicated times. Cell lysates (50 μg) were fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transfected to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with antibodies against phospho-MEK (A) or phospho-MAPK (B). The quantification data were obtained by scanning Western blot bands.

Serum-starved cells were pre-incubated without AG1478 (A) or with AG1478 (200 nm) (B) for 10 min before stimulation with the indicated ligands for 5 min. The cell lysates were analyzed by antibodies against phospho-MAPK or MAPK.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) HPO was reported to stimulate DNA synthesis of HepG2 cells. To further confirm the role of EGFR in HPO signaling, we measured the mitogenic function of HPO in the presence or absence of AG1478. DNA synthesis was determined by thymidine incorporation. The results in Fig. 4 show that AG1478 completely blocked the induction of DNA synthesis triggered by EGF and HPO, indicating that EGFR is essential for the mitogenic effect of HPO. Taking these results together, we conclude that the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of AG1478-sensitive kinase is a prerequisite of the HPO signaling leading to both MAPK activation and mitogenic response. It was previously demonstrated that the GLC-82 cell line (human lung cancer cells) does not express the specific receptor of HPO (12Wang G. Yang X.M. Zhang Y. Wang Q.M. Chen H.P. Wei H.D. Xing G.C. Xie L. Hu Z.Y. Zhang C.G. Fang D.C. Wu C. He F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11469-11472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To identify the potential role of the specific receptor of HPO in HPO signaling, GLC-82 cells were utilized to test whether the specific HPO receptor is required for the activation of EGFR and MAPK triggered by HPO. The results in Fig. 5 indicate that HPO had no effect on the phosphorylation of EGFR nor MAPK in GLC-82 cells, whereas EGF stimulated phosphorylation of both EGFR and MAPK. These data suggest that the specific receptor of HPO might be required for the activation of EGFR and MAPK during HPO signaling. It has been demonstrated that HPO has its own specific receptor that is different from the receptors of EGF, TGF-α, and insulin on the HepG2 cells, because EGF, TGF-α, and insulin have no competitive effect on125I-HPO binding to the cell surface sites (12Wang G. Yang X.M. Zhang Y. Wang Q.M. Chen H.P. Wei H.D. Xing G.C. Xie L. Hu Z.Y. Zhang C.G. Fang D.C. Wu C. He F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11469-11472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In vitro binding experiments indicate no direct physical interaction of HPO with the receptors of EGF, TGF-α, and insulin. Therefore, the induction of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation by HPO may be a ligand-independent event, i.e. the triggering of tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR by HPO might be different from a direct ligand-receptor interaction. To test this hypothesis, the specific antibody mAb528 against EGFR, which has been widely utilized to block the extracellular ligand-interacting domain (20Gabelman B.M. Emerman J.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was used. Our results show that mAb528 indeed had no effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR triggered by HPO, although it completely blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation triggered by EGF (Fig.6). The above results suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR triggered by HPO is independent of EGFR-ligand interaction. The effect of HPO on EGFR is not due to a direct binding of HPO to EGFR. The results in Figs. 5 and 6 indicate that HPO binds its own receptor and indirectly induces activation of a tyrosine kinase(s) and EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. Genistein is a universal inhibitor of tyrosine kinases (19Levitki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar). To provide further evidence, we compared the effect of genistein on EGFR phosphorylation triggered by HPO and EGF. The results (Fig.7) show that in the absence of genistein, tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR was induced 64.0 ± 7.5- and 24.0 ± 4.3-fold by EGF and HPO, respectively. In comparison, genistein significantly attenuated the effect of HPO on EGFR phosphorylation (reduced approximately 20-fold) at a relatively low dose (5 μg/ml) and completely blocked the effect of HPO at 10 μg/ml. However, genistein had no significant effect on EGFR phosphorylation induced by EGFR at the same doses (5 and 10 μg/ml) and displayed a mild effect at 15 μg/ml. These results indicate that HPO and EGF probably use different mechanisms to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. We propose that HPO may activate a tyrosine kinase(s), which is different from EGFR and more sensitive to genistein inhibition. Activation of this unidentified tyrosine kinase is likely to play an important role in HPO signaling because genistein completely blocked the HPO effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. Although the role of HPO as a stimulator of hepatocyte proliferation in liver regeneration has been systematically investigated since the 1970s, the molecular mechanisms of HPO action are unclear. The MAPK pathway is well demonstrated to be an important growth-related pathway in liver regeneration, which was activated by some hepatic growth factors, including the three most important mitogens, EGF, TGF-α, and HGF (11Fausto N. Lairo A.D. Webber E.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1527-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Those mitogens take effect in the course of the whole cell cycle, including an initial phase in which cells become primed to proliferation and a second phase in which competent hepatocytes progress through G1 and undergo proliferation (22Diehl A.M. Rai R.M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). However, HPO appears to act at the late G1/S interface and stimulates DNA synthesis of those hepatocytes that have already entered the second phase (3LaBrecque D.R. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1994; 89 (suppl.): 90-96Google Scholar). Intriguingly, our results here show that MAPK is also activated by HPO. However, in the view of divergent characteristics of HPO compared with those mitogens, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the HPO signaling leading to MAPK activation might be by a mechanism different from other hepatocyte mitogens. More and more evidence shows that EGFR acts not only as a receptor for EGF-like ligands but also as a mediator of diverse signaling systems (23Putz T. Culig Z. Eder I.E. Nessler-Menardi C. Bartsch G. Grunicke H. Uberall F. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 227-233PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cunnick J.M. Dorsey J.F. Standley T. Turkson J. Kraker A.J. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14468-14475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A wide variety of mitogens, including some agonists of G protein-coupled receptors such as lysophosphatic acid, thrombin (25Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), and agonists with unknown receptors (21Zanella C.L. Posada J. Tritton T.R. Mossman B.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5334-5338PubMed Google Scholar), stimulate cell growth via active EGFR in a ligand-independent pathway. In this study, we demonstrate that HPO triggers MAPK activation and proliferation in HepG2 cells through induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. Furthermore, our data suggest that activation of EGFR requires an HPO-specific receptor but not the direct binding of HPO or EGF to EGFR. The characteristics of EGFR activation by HPO are similar to those stimuli previously identified in an EGF-independent way. Our findings suggest that HPO binds its receptor and then triggers a tyrosine kinase(s) to activate EGFR or that HPO directly initiates the phosphorylation of EGFR. The difference of sensitivity to genistein of EGFR activation induced by HPO and EGF supports this hypothesis. Although HPO is capable of inducing phosphorylation of EGFR, HPO cannot cover the diverse function of EGF completely. For instance, unlike EGF, HPO cannot induce the phosphorylation of STAT3 (signal transducter and activator of transcription 3) in HepG2 cells (data not shown) and cannot stimulate growth of various tissues and cells other than liver and hepatocyte. This further indicates the difference of signaling pathways between HPO and EGF. This report provides the first biochemical data about the signal transduction pathway of HPO. We demonstrated that HPO stimulates the activation of EGFR and MAPK. Furthermore, our results show that tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR is important for the effect of HPO on activation of MAPK and stimulation of cell proliferation. These data provide important information for further investigation about the mechanisms of HPO action and the relationship between HPO and other hepatocyte mitogens, especially EGF. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of HPO action will be valuable for our understanding of liver organogenesis, regeneration, and oncogenesis.

Egr-1, a zinc finger transcription factor, is elevated more than 5-fold in human carotid lesions relative to the adjacent tunica media. Lesion cells in vitro also express 2–3-fold higher Egr-1 mRNA and protein levels but express much lower levels of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) Type II receptor (TβR-2) and are functionally resistant to the antiproliferative effects of TGF-β. Lesion cells fail to express a TβR-2 promoter/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct but overexpress an Egr-1-inducible platelet-derived growth factor-A promoter/CAT construct. Transfection of Egr-1 cDNA represses TβR-2/CAT constructs but induces PDGF-A/CAT. Egr-1 transfection reduces the levels of TβR-2 and confers resistance to the antiproliferative effect of TGF-β1. Egr-1 can interact directly with both the −143 Sp1 site and the positive regulatory element 2 (PRE2) (ERT/ets) region of the TβR-2 promoter. Thus, although activating a family of stress-responsive genes, Egr-1 also transcriptionally represses one of the major inhibitory pathways that restrains vascular repair.

Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9929) Google Scholar). However, it is evident that the major arteries tolerate these injuries for decades, successfully repairing the injury to maintain both vascular integrity and patency. After chronic injury, vascular repair cells, phenotypically similar to both smooth muscle cells and myofibroblasts (2Schmitt-Graff A. Desmouliere A. Gabbiani G. Virchows Arch. 1994; 425: 3-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), eventually accumulate in the vessel wall and occlude the vessel by progressive fibroproliferative remodeling. Atherosclerotic lesions commonly show a strong hyperplastic reaction to angioplasty or surgical endarterectomy, suggesting that their response to defined injuries is exaggerated. Vascular repair cells in the late lesion may suffer from a failure to die phenotype that allows the cell to respond to injury but disables its ability to undergo apoptosis as a natural part of wound regression (3Rembold C. Perspect. Biol. Med. 1996; 39: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells cultured from human atherosclerotic lesions initially show a high rate of apoptosis as they encounter in vitro conditions (4Bennett M.R. Evan G.I. Schwartz S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), but then a substantial subset of cells emerge that are resistant to apoptosis induced by factors such as TGF-β1 (5McCaffrey T.A. Consigli S. Du B. Falcone D.J. Sanborn T.A. Spokojny A.M. Bush H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2667-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and glucocorticoids (6Bray P. Du B. Mejia V. Hao S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).The resistance to the antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of TGF-β is principally due to a selective age-related loss of the Type II receptor for TGF-β (TβR-2) (5McCaffrey T.A.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), thus leading to fibrotic, antiproliferative, and apoptotic responses in human lesion cells (11McCaffrey T. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Transfection of cDNA for TβR-2 partially restores the antiproliferative response to TGF-β in lesion cells (5McCaffrey T.A. Consigli S. Du B. Falcone D.J. Sanborn T.A. Spokojny A.M. Bush H. J. Clin.

TβR-2 is expressed in early atherosclerotic lesions but is essentially undetectable in late lesions, except in discrete foci adjoining inflammatory regions (7McCaffrey T. Du B. Bray P. Fu C.

A small subset of patients can be defined in which acquired mutations in the TβR-2 contribute to the receptor loss, although the majority of cases cannot be explained by mutations in the receptor (13McCaffrey T. Du B. Consigli S. Szabo P. Bray P. Hartner L. Weksler B. Sanborn T. Bergman G. Bush H. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2182-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar).Using cDNA arrays to profile the mRNA transcripts of carotid artery lesions relative to the adjacent media, it was observed that the transcription factor Egr-1 was 5-fold higher in the human atherosclerotic lesion than in the adjacent media (14McCaffrey T. Fu C. Du B. Eksinar S. Kent K. Bush H. Kreiger K. Rosengart T. Cybulsky M. Silverman E. Collins T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed that Egr-1 levels were 4–8-fold higher in individual lesions relative to the adjacent media. Control studies rejected the possibility that the differences in Egr-1 were induced ex vivo because 1) this should induce Egr-1 in both media and lesion equally, and 2) Egr-1 mRNA levels in lesion and media were stableex vivo for an hour after surgery. The Egr-1 appeared to be transcriptionally active in the human lesion, because a high percentage of Egr-1-inducible genes were also elevated in the lesions relative to the adjacent media. Furthermore, in hypercholesterolemic mice, Egr-1 levels were found to parallel the development of the atherosclerotic lesion (14McCaffrey T. Fu C. Du B. Eksinar S. Kent K. Bush H. Kreiger K.

Egr-1 is potentially activated by a variety of cellular stressors: growth factors (15Silverman E.S. Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Am. J.

The results indicate that Egr-1 is a transcriptional repressor of TβR-2, presumably by interacting directly with both an Sp1 site and an ets-like ERT site in the proximal promoter of the TβR-2 gene. Thus, although activating a family of stress-responsive genes, Egr-1 also suppresses one of the major inhibitory pathways that restrains vascular repair.RESULTSExpression of Egr-1 in cells derived from human atherosclerotic lesions. Prior studies from this laboratory demonstrate that cells cultured from lesions or the adjacent media exhibit differences in their functional response to growth factors such as TGF-β1 (5McCaffrey T.A.

Hanauske-Abel H. McCaffrey T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1180-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The lesions, from which these cells derive, exhibit a 5-fold increase in Egr-1 levels compared with the adjacent media (14McCaffrey T. Fu C. Du B. Eksinar S. Kent K. Bush H. Kreiger K. Rosengart T. Cybulsky M. Silverman E. Collins T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To determine whether the elevated Egr-1 expression of lesion cells was retained by the cells migrating from the lesion and proliferating in tissue culture, two lesions (E196, E197) were identified that produced productive cell cultures from both the lesion and from the adjacent media. RNA was prepared from these cultures at identical, early subpassages (P2) and analyzed individually by cDNA arrays.Overall, the transcript profiles between medial and lesion cells were quite similar (r = 0.90, p < 0.001), with a relatively small set of genes that differed. TableI contains genes that were increased or decreased in lesion cells and might be relevant to a resistant phenotype. Among these genes is Egr-1, which was 1.9 times higher in lesion cells (L) than in autologous medial cells (M) in culture. In contrast, Sp1 mRNA levels in lesion cells were decreased to one-half the level in medial cells, so that the Egr-1/Sp1 mRNA ratio was effectively 4 times higher in lesion compared with medial cells.Figure 1Egr-1 protein levels in cells from lesionversus adjacent media. Cells were cultured by explant from the fibrous cap of human atherosclerotic plaques (L, lesion) or the adjacent tunica media of the carotid artery (M, media). Four patients (E197, etc.) are shown, representing a total of eight patients. Cells were plated in low passage (P2-P4) in 1% FBS for 24 h before harvest and then examined by Western blot analysis for Egr-1 or β-actin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ISelected transcripts detected by cDNA arraysGenBank™ accession numberTranscript nameMedialLesionRatio (L/M)%%Increased in lesion cells L05515CREB0.561.763.15 M25667GAP-431.273.222.55 M97796Id-22.114.742.25 M36711AP-21.162.542.19 M62829EGR-18.9717.221.92 M76541NF-E1 (YY1)0.901.701.90Decreased in lesion cells X60188ERK10.610.310.51 J03133Sp11.010.490.49 L05624MEK11.570.480.31 M21574PDGF-α receptor1.820.470.26 L31951JNK21.960.500.26 M97191Sp30.750.190.25 L36870Erk kinase 1 (MKK4/SEK1)2.520.400.16 Open table in a new tab Levels of Egr-1 Protein in Medial and Lesion CellsWhether these elevated Egr-1 mRNA levels translated to increased Egr-1 protein levels was examined by Western blot on eight lesion/media cultures, two of which had been tested in the cDNA arrays. In all eight lesion/media-matched cultures (E196, E197, E221, E243, E246, E278, E281, E291), the lesion cells (L) expressed markedly higher Egr-1 protein antigen than did the cells derived from the adjacent media (M) (Fig. 1, four patients shown). The same blots were reprobed with an antibody to β-actin, and equal levels were observed between samples (Fig. 1). Quantitation of the Egr-1 band intensities by densitometric scanning of film or by Storm chemiluminescence yielded similar results, both indicating that the level of Egr-1 antigen level was 2.6 times higher in lesion cells compared with medial cells (L/M ratio = 2.6, p < 0.0002). Thus, the elevated Egr-1 levels observed in the atherosclerotic lesion are retained by the lesion cells in culture and lead to elevated Egr-1 protein levels.Levels of TβR-2 Protein and Antiproliferative Response to TGF-β1 in Medial and Lesion CellsAlthough the lesion cells demonstrated elevated Egr-1 levels, levels of the TβR-2 protein were significantly lower in lesion cells than in medial cells (L/M ratio = 0.38, p < .01). This is consistent with prior data indicating both reduced125I-TGF-β cross-linking to the TβR-2 and reduced TβR-2 mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in lesion cells (5McCaffrey T.A. Consigli S. Du B. Falcone D.J. Sanborn T.A. Spokojny A.M. Bush H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2667-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, there was a consistent pattern of elevated Egr-1 and reduced TβR-2 in lesion-derived cells relative to their medial counterparts (Fig. 2 A). Furthermore, the reduced levels of the TβR-2 were associated with functional resistance to the antiproliferative effect of TGF-β1 in the lesion cells. The ability of TGF-β1 to inhibit DNA synthesis in two of the matched lesion/medial cell lines is shown in Fig. 2 B. Although cells from the media are inhibited 50–60% by 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 in 24 h, cells derived from the adjacent lesion are stimulated 50–60% under identical conditions. The ability of TGF-β to stimulate DNA synthesis is probably due to the induction of soluble mitogens such as PDGF (40Battegay E.J. Raines E.W. Seifert R.A. Bowen-Pope D.F. Ross R. Cell. 1990; 63: 515-524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) and connective tissue growth factor (41Grotendorst G.R. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 171-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) by a subset of cells possessing TβR-2. The mitogens can then diffuse in the culture flask to stimulate cells regardless of their TβR-2 status.Figure 2Expression of TβR-2, Egr-1, and antiproliferative responses to TGF-β in lesion (L) and medial (M) cells. A, protein was harvested as in Fig. 1. Western blots were probed for Egr-1 and TβR-2 using specific antibodies and chemiluminescent detection.

To determine whether Egr-1 levels could be induced by growth factor in medial cells, which have low Egr-1 levels, medial cells were subjected to serum withdrawal for 24 h and then stimulated with FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) or NGF (100 ng/ml) for specified periods of time up to 4 h.Both FGF-2 and NGF led to a rapid increase (30 min) in Egr-1 protein (82–85 kDa) to a level twice the base-line level in medial cells (Fig. 3, A and B). The effect was partially reversed at 1–2 h after growth factor treatment, remaining 50% above the unstimulated level. Based on parallel wells in which the media was changed, but without growth factor (4 h), the increase was not due to nonspecific stimulation of the cells. Although NGF was able to stimulate Egr-1 levels in medial cells (E196M is shown in Fig. 3), NGF had no mitogenic effect on this cell line, as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation 24 h after stimulation. Lesion-derived cells, which had very high basal levels of Egr-1 protein (E197L), did not show any further stimulation by NGF (Fig. 3 A). In lesion cells with lower base-line levels (E196L), stimulation of Egr-1 levels by FGF-2 was detectable.Figure 3Induction of Egr-1 by FGF-2 and NGF. Cells derived from carotid media (Medial) or atherosclerotic lesion (Lesion) were cultured under low serum conditions for 48 h and then stimulated with FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) or NGF (100 ng/ml) for the specified times. To control for nonspecific effects of adding media, parallel wells were treated identically, but no growth factor was added (4 h, panel A, and NO FGF andNO NGF in panel B). Cells were harvested, lysed, and analyzed by Western blot as described, and band intensity of Egr-1 in medial cells was semi-quantitated densitometrically (panel B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)TβR-2 Promoter Activity in Lesion and Medial CellsIn light of the association of high Egr-1 levels with low TβR-2 levels and resistance to TGF-β, the expression of TβR-2 promoter/reporter constructs was examined in lesion versusmedial cells. As shown in Fig. 4 the CAT reporter plasmid is essentially inactive in the absence of a promoter (CAT null). The introduction of the TβR-2 promoter from −274/+50 or −47/+50 causes an increase to 8–10-fold above base-line reporter activity in medial cells but not in lesion cells (n = 3 matched cell lines, mean ± S.E.). Conversely, the PDGF-A chain promoter, a prototype of Egr-1-inducible promoters (15Silverman E.S. Khachigian L.M. Lindner V. Williams A.J. Collins T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H1415-H1426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is about 2-fold more active in lesion cells than in medial cells, whereas the SV40-luciferase construct is more variable but unchanged.Figure 4Expression of TβR-2 promoter/reporter constructs by medial and lesion cells. Autologous media/lesion cultures from 3 patients (E278, E281, E291) were transfected with one of five promoter/reporter constructs: CAT null (no promoter), TβR-2-274/CAT (−274/+50), TβR-2-47/CAT (−47/+50), PDGF-A chain promoter/CAT, or SV40 promoter upstream of luciferase reporter.

To determine the effect of elevated Egr-1 on transcription of TβR-2, expression vectors containing Egr-1 or Sp1 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (pcDNA3) were transfected into several cell types, and then 48 h later, other plasmids containing regions of the TβR-2 promoter (−274/+50 or −47/+50) driving the CAT reporter gene were retransfected into the same cultures. Control studies transfecting either empty vector, human Egr-1, or murine Egr-1 into E12 cells and then harvesting the cells at specific time points for Western blot indicated that both human and murine Egr-1 expression vectors increased Egr-1 antigen to levels 3–5 times the control levels by 48 h and that these levels were sustained at 96 h post-transfection.Figure 5Structure of the proximal region of the TβR-2 promoter. Prior deletional analysis has identified a positive regulatory element (PRE1) that interacts with AP1 like factors, followed by two functional Sp1 sites at −143 and −25 relative to the predicted transcriptional start site. Current analysis of the −143 Sp1 site indicates that it shares homology to known Egr-1 binding sequences, as shown in the expanded sequence. Consensus Sp1 and Egr-1 sites are shown above the TβR-2 sequence and the PDGF-A chain sequence for comparison. This −143 site is flanked 3′ by a known negative regulatory element (NRE) with an unknown ligand. Oligo-capping of the mRNA suggests transcription may begin from a −36 GAA alternate start site. A second PRE (PRE2) was identified at +12, which was later shown to bind a novel member of theets family, ERT, recognizing tandem GGAA sites on the negative strand. The downstream ERT site appears to overlap a potential Egr-1 binding site on the negative strand.

Both IGF-1 and its receptor have been shown to be highly expressed in atherosclerotic lesions. Here we investigated whether part of the vasculoprotective properties of E2 may be mediated by its negative regulation of the IGF-1 system. HeLa cells, which do not contain endogenous estrogen receptors (ER), were transiently transfected with IGF-1R promoter constructs with or without a plasmid encoding human ERα or ERβ and treated with 100 nm 17β-estradiol (E2) for 24 h. E2 treatment decreased basal luciferase activity by 51%, and this effect was dependent on co-expression of ERα, whereas no repression was observed with ERβ. A mutation within the DNA binding domain of the ERα abolished the repressor function of the ER receptor. Similarly, E2 decreased IGF-1R transcription by 21% in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC), which express endogenous ER. This effect was specific for E2, because it was inhibited by an antiestrogen and because progesterone did not have any effect on IGF-1R expression in HeLa or RASMC transfected with progesterone receptor. Accordingly, E2 decreased IGF-1R and IGF-1 mRNA in RASMC by 47% and 33%. Western blot analysis and radioligand binding studies showed that E2 also dose-dependently decreased IGF-1R protein expression in RASMC by 40% and 30%, respectively, and that IGF-1 protein was reduced by 43%. Repression of IGF-1R promoter activity by a combination of ERα and E2 did not appear to be mediated via direct binding of ER to the IGF-1R promoter but rather by inhibition of SP1 binding to the IGF-1R promoter. Thus, E2down-regulates IGF-1R and IGF-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. This may have important implications for the understanding of the beneficial effects of estrogen in the cardiovascular system.

The possible involvement of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)1 and IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) in cardiovascular pathology has recently raised interest.In vitro data have shown that IGF-1 is a potent vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) mitogen (16Pfeifle B.

Furthermore, regulation of IGF-1 binding proteins (IGFBPs) by growth factors may be physiologically important (25Anwar A. Zahid A.A. Phillips L. Delafontaine P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Steroid receptors, including the estrogen receptors (ER) α and β, mediate the specific response of cells to their respective ligands by virtue of their ability to bind cis-acting regulatory sequences termed steroid response elements (for review see Ref. 26Evans R. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6326) Google Scholar). Although much is known about mechanisms of gene activation by ER, less information exists about repression of gene expression by ER. Although activation of genes by estrogens is typically mediated by binding of the activated receptor to the respective response element(s) present upstream of or within target genes, negative regulation by these hormones cannot always be explained by receptor-DNA interaction (27Beato M. Cell. 1989; 56: 335-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2851) Google Scholar, 28Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1131-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the inhibition of IL-6 in HeLa cells, lipoprotein lipase in 3T3-L1 cells, tumor necrosis factor α in U937 cells, IGF-1 gene expression in primary rat osteoblasts, and the mannose-6 IGF-II receptor gene in breast cancer cells by estrogens are the only documented examples of repression by estrogens (29Adler S.

It was therefore of interest to us to explore the effects of estradiol on IGF-1R and IGF-1 expression in vascular cells such as RASMC and to determine the molecular mechanisms of ER-mediated action on IGF-1R gene expression. We show that E2 dose-dependently decreases IGF-1R and IGF-1 expression and that the antiproliferative activity of E2 involves a down-regulation of IGF-1R and IGF-1. However, we found no direct binding of ER to sequences in the IGF-1R promoter that were sufficient to confer repression by ER in functional experiments. Nevertheless, results obtained from bandshift experiments indicated that there was an interaction between SP1 and ER, because ER decreased SP1 binding to the IGF-1R promoter. These data indicate that ER can modulate transcription from promoters that lack classical estrogen response elements (ERE) and have important implications for understanding cardiovascular effects of estrogens. Cell culture media and LipofectAMINE were purchased from Life Technologies (Basel, Switzerland). 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (OHT), 17β-estradiol, and progesterone were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The antiestrogen ICI 164,384 was a kind gift from Dr. A. Wakeling (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, UK).

Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Dübendorf, Switzerland). Iodinated IGF-1 was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). RASMC (kindly provided by Dr. K. Griendling, Emory University, Atlanta, GA) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. HeLa cells were cultured under similar conditions with 5% fetal bovine serum. The ER-expressing, human breast tumor cells, MCF-7 (34Horwitz K.B. Zara D.T. Thilagar A.K. Jensen E.M. McGuire W.L. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 2434-2437PubMed Google Scholar), were maintained in DMEM and 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to experiments, cell media were changed to DMEM without Phenol Red, containing dextran-coated, charcoal-treated, heat-inactivated (DCT) fetal bovine serum. The full-length promoter of the IGF-1R p(−2350/+640-Luc) and the shorter construct p(−476/+640-Luc) were a generous gift from Dr. H. Werner (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Deletion fragments were made from the full-length promoter construct and subcloned upstream of the firefly luciferase cDNA (35Scheidegger K.J. Du J. Delafontaine P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3522-3530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The plasmids encoding human ERα (HEG0), HE82, human ERβ (pCMV-hERβ), and pCMV-SP1 were kind gifts from Dr. P. Chambon (Strasbourg, France), Dr. S. Mader (Montreal, Canada), Dr. J.-Å. Gustafsson (Huddinge, Sweden), and Dr. R. Tjian (University of California at Berkeley, CA), respectively. The following constructs have previously been described: the empty vector pSG5 (36Green S. Issemann I. Sheer E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 369Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar), and XETL (37Bunone G. Briand P.A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2174-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). In brief, HEG0 carries human wild-type ERα cDNA, HE82 contains human ERα cDNA with a mutation in the DNA binding domain resulting in the recognition of a glucocorticoid response element instead of an ERE (38Mader S. Kumar V. Verneuil de H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and the reporter plasmid XETL expresses firefly luciferase under control of one vitellogenin A2 ERE upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. The coding sequence of the human progesterone receptor B (PRB) was subcloned into the unique EcoRI site of pSG5 resulting in pSG5/hPR. HeLa cells were plated in 24-well and RASMC in 12-well plates and transfected with 1 μg of reporter plasmid and 5 ng of pRL-TK per well with or without 200 ng of HEG0, pSG5/hPR, HE82, pCMV-hERβ, or pCMV-SP1 with LipofectAMINE reagent. 20 h after transfection, the DNA-containing medium was changed and the cells were treated with or without E2 (100 nm) or progesterone (100 nm) for 12–24 h. In some experiments transfected cells were incubated with OHT (1 μm) or ICI (0.1 μm) for 1 h prior to the addition of E2. Luciferase activity was measured with the Dual-Luciferase kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to the internal control Renillaluciferase (Luc/Ren). RNase protection assays were performed as described previously (18Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In brief, 20 μg of total RNA was hybridized with [32P]UTP-labeled antisense IGF-1R and IGF-1 riboprobe and cohybridized with an 18 S probe (Ambion, Austin, TX). After overnight hybridization at 42 °C and RNase digestion, samples were proteinase K-treated, phenol-extracted, and analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide/8 m urea denaturing gel electrophoresis. Densitometric analyses were performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Radioligand binding assays were performed as described previously (39Ververis J.J. Ku L. Delafontaine P. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, RASMC cultured under DCT serum conditions treated with or without E2 in 24-well plates were incubated with 0.1 nm125I-IGF-1 and 0–0.1 μm unlabeled IGF-1 for 90 min at room temperature. Cells were washed in ice-cold binding buffer and solubilized in 0.2 n NaOH before counting. All assays were performed in duplicate for each experimental point. Data were analyzed using the LIGAND program. Prior to the experiments, cultured RASMC were switched to Phenol Red-free DMEM containing DCT FBS for 48 h before adding E2 at various concentrations for 24 h. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed as previously published (35Scheidegger K.J. Du J. Delafontaine P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3522-3530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7.5% gels, and separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were blocked with 5% dry milk and incubated with anti-IGF-1Rβ antibody and secondary peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody. Immunopositive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Specific IGF-1 immunoreactivity of cell-conditioned medium was determined as described previously (18Delafontaine P. Bernstein K.E. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell medium was dialyzed, lyophilized, and chromatographed using Bio-Gel P-30 polyacrylamide columns (Bio-Rad Laboratories AG, Glattbrugg, Switzerland). IGF-1 fractions were assayed using a polyclonal anti-IGF-1 rabbit antiserum (kindly provided by Dr. A. F. Parlow, UCLA). Standard curves were generated using human recombinant IGF-1. RASMC were plated in 24-well plates in DMEM without Phenol Red alone or containing DCT FBS. After 48 h cells were treated with or without E2, for 24 h in complete medium. 1 μCi/ml of [3H]thymidine was added during the last 2 h of the incubation period. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, incubated for 30 min in 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice, washed two times in ice-cold 95% ethanol, and lysed in 0.2 n NaOH. Samples were measured by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. All experiments were performed in quadruplicates. The human ER, PRB, and HE82 proteins were synthesized in vitro in TNT-T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Nuclear extracts from untransfected MCF-7 and RASMC, or HeLa cells transfected with HEG0, were incubated with recombinant human SP1, NFκB, or ERα proteins in binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.3 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and32P-labeled DNA in a final volume of 20 μl at room temperature. Preincubations containing ligand, antibody, and/or cold competitor (200-fold excess) as indicated were performed at room temperature for 15 min. After the incubation step the probe was added and binding conducted for additional 20 min. Reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 6% PAGE gel in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA (TBE). The following oligonucleotide and its complement were used as labeled probes and cold/unlabeled competitors: ERE, 5′-GATCTCTTTGATCAGGTCACTGTGACCTGACTTTG-3′. The probe for the IGF-1R promoter extended from nucleotides −476/+21. All experiments were performed at least three times. Statistical significance was measured by Student's ttest. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To measure the effect of E2 on IGF-1R gene expression, HeLa cells, which do not contain endogenous ER, were transiently transfected with the full-length IGF-1R promoter reporter construct with or without cotransfecting HEG0, a plasmid encoding human ERα. In HeLa cells estradiol treatment (100 nm for 24 h) decreased basal luciferase activity to 49 ± 5% (Fig. 1 A). This effect was ER-dependent, because E2 did not reduce basal IGF-1R expression in HeLa cells when human ER was not cotransfected. Similarly, E2 decreased by 21% IGF-1R transcription in RASMC-expressing endogenous ER (p = 0.005) (Fig. 1 B). Using specific primers for rat ERα and rat ERβ, we found both transcripts in RASMC (data not shown) as has been previously published by others (40Kuiper G.G.J.M. Carlsson B. Grandien K. Enmark E.

The fact that E2 stimulated transactivation of a minimal ERE promoter reporter construct in RASMC without transfecting HEG0 (data not shown) supports the notion that the endogenous ERs were functional as has been previously shown by others (41Bayard F. Clamens S. Meggetto F. Blaes N. Delsol G. Faye J.-C. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 1523-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Accordingly, these effects of E2 appeared to be specific, because progesterone did not have any effect on IGF-1R expression in HeLa, or RASMC transfected with progesterone receptor (data not shown). In addition, the E2 antagonist ICI 164,384 reversed the reduction in IGF-1R promoter activity induced by E2, demonstrating a specific ER-mediated effect, whereas the partial antagonist OHT acted in a synergistic way by further decreasing luciferase activity (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, the repression of IGF-1R promoter activity by E2 was abrogated when smaller IGF-1R promoter deletion mutants were used. Indeed, the reduction in luciferase activity was maintained with the construct p(−476/+21) and p(−416/+21), however, the reduction disappeared with p(−330/+21), suggesting that the E2-responsive region was located 5′ of base pair −330 in the IGF-1R promoter (data not shown). Importantly, HE82, an ER mutant carrying a mutation within the DNA binding domain and thus recognizing a glucocorticoid response element instead of an ERE, was unable to repress expression from the IGF-1R promoter, suggesting that an ER with an intact DNA binding domain is required (Fig. 1 D). Since the identification of a second ER subtype, termed the ERβ (44Kuiper G.G.J.M. Enmark E. Pelto-Huikko M. Nilsson S. Gustafsson J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5925-5930Crossref PubMed Scopus (4224) Google Scholar, 45Mosselman S. Polman J. Dijkema R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar), much research has been focused on the potentially distinct role of ERα and ERβ in vasculoprotection. It was therefore of interest to determine whether the reduction in IGF-1R transcription by the combination of E2 and ERα was subtype-specific or whether it could also be observed using ERβ. Most interestingly, E2 did not repress IGF-1R transcription when HeLa cells were transfected with human ERβ, which suggests a ERα subtype-specific effect (Fig. 1 D). To confirm the results obtained in transfection studies, endogenous IGF-1 and IGF-1R mRNA levels were measured by RNase protection assay in RASMC treated with or without E2. In agreement with the transfection studies, E2 significantly and dose-dependently reduced basal levels of IGF-1 and IGF-1R by 47% and 33%, respectively (Fig. 2 A), whereas OHT had similar effects as E2 (Fig. 2 B). Similarly to the transcriptional assays, the antiestrogen ICI reversed the decreasing effect of E2 on IGF-1 and IGF-1R (Fig. 2 B). A dose-response with ICI on IGF-1R mRNA showed that 10−7m and 10−6m ICI, but not 10−8m ICI, blocked the effect of E2: control, 100 ± 0%; E2, 65 ± 11%; ICI 10−8m/E2, 63 ± 12%; ICI 10−7m/E2, 100 ± 17%; ICI 10−6m/E2, 109 ± 37%; ICI 10−8m, 88 ± 1%; ICI 10−7m, 114 ± 19%; ICI 10−6m, 104 ± 19%; n = 3. To assess whether E2 decreased IGF-1R protein levels, cell lysates of RASMC treated with or without increasing doses of E2 were assayed for IGF-1R protein level by Western immunoblot and radioligand binding. E2dose-dependently decreased IGF-1R protein expression after 24 h, starting with doses of 1 nmE2 and resulting in a 40% reduction with 100 nm E2 (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, E2(100 nm) reduced basal IGF-1 binding sites by approximately 30% as measured by radioligand binding studies, further confirming the results seen in Western blots (percentage change in IGF-1R number: control = 100 ± 0% and E2 = 71 ± 7%, respectively, n = 4). In addition, IGF-1 protein levels in RASMC were also significantly reduced by E2 (43% reduction with 100 nm E2) as measured by RIA of cell-conditioned medium (Fig. 3 B). IGF-1 is a potent mitogen, and a functional IGF-1R is required for the mitogenic effects of various growth factors (22Delafontaine P. Anwar A. Lou H. Ku L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Delafontaine P. Meng X.P. Ku L. Du J. J. Biol.

To determine whether the reduced levels of IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression induced by E2could explain the reduced DNA synthesis observed after E2treatment (14Bhalla R.C. Toth K.F. Bhatty R.A.

Hypertension. 1998; 32: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we measured [3H]thymidine incorporation in confluent RASMC. As shown in TableI, E2dose-dependently reduced DNA synthesis under serum conditions by approximately 50%.

In preliminary experiments, we tested our EMSA conditions by determining classical ER binding to its consensus response element and concurrent supershift with anti-ER antibodies (Fig. 4 A). To investigate the binding of ER to the IGF-1R promoter sequences, the ER-regulated promoter construct p(−476/+21) was used. Nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells formed retarded bands with the 32P-labeled IGF-1R probe, which could be supershifted by anti-ERα antibody (data not shown). However, neither in vitro synthesized or purified ER bound the IGF-1R promoter probe, whereas SP1 and NFκB proteins formed a retarded band complex (data not shown). Interestingly, the intensity of the two main SP1-dependent bands was significantly reduced by co-incubation with in vitro synthesized ER or purified ER (Fig. 4 B), whereas both ER preparations had no effect on the NFκB-dependent band (data not shown). Although ER protein diminished the SP1/probe band, in vitrotranslated PRB or HE82, human ERα carrying a mutation in the DNA binding domain, had no effect, indicating not only an ER-specific effect but also an effect dependent on a conserved ER DNA binding domain (Fig. 4 B). Because recent studies have demonstrated that physical and functional interactions exist between ERα and the transcription factor SP1 (50Batistuzzo de Medeiros S.R. Krey G. Hihi A.K. Wahli W. J.

We have previously reported a t(11;15)(q23;q14) in a case of acute myeloblastic leukaemia. Here, we report the cloning of a novel MLL partner, AF15q14, at chromosome 15q14. In this translocation, the breakpoint occurred in exon 8 of MLL and exon 10 of AF15q14. The normal AF15q14 transcripts of approximately 8.5 kb in size, are expressed in different tumoral cell lines, in a variety of normal tissues, and in all the foetal tissues tested. Sequencing of AF15q14 cDNA revealed a putative open reading frame of 1833 amino acids that had no homology with any other known protein. The C-terminal end of the putative AF15q14 contained a bipartite nuclear localization site. The translocation t(11;15) preserved the open reading frame between MLL and the 3′ end of AF15q14. The contribution of AF15q14 to the fusion protein was only 85 amino acids. Immunofluorescence staining experiments with expression vectors encoding these 85 amino acids confirmed the functionality of the predicted nuclear localization site."
https://openalex.org/W2105259312,"Two protein forms of tyrosine phosphatase epsilon (PTPepsilon) are known - receptor-like (tm-PTPepsilon) and non receptor-like (cyt-PTPepsilon), with each form possessing unique tissue-specific expression patterns, subcellular localization, and physiological functions. We describe two additional forms of PTPepsilon protein - p67 and p65. p67 is produced by initiation of translation at an internal initiation codon of PTPepsilon mRNA molecules, while p65 is produced by specific proteolytic cleavage of larger PTPepsilon proteins. Cleavage is inhibited by MG132, but is proteasome-independent. In contrast with full-length tm-PTPepsilon and cyt-PTPepsilon, p67 and p65 are exclusively cytoplasmic, are not phosphorylated by Neu, and do not associate with Grb2 in unstimulated cells. p67 and p65 are catalytically active and can reduce Src-mediated phosphorylation of the Kv2.1 voltage-gated potassium channel, albeit with reduced efficiency which most likely results from their cytoplasmic localization. We also show that full-length cyt-PTPepsilon protein can be found at the cell membrane and in the nucleus and that it is the first 27 residues of cyt-PTPepsilon which determine this localization. p67 and p65 provide mechanisms for removing PTPepsilon activity from the cell membrane, possibly serving to down-regulate PTPepsilon activity there. PTPepsilon emerges as a family of four related proteins whose expression, subcellular localization and most likely physiological roles are subject to complex regulation at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels."

It is located in the P domain with connections to M4 and M5, and the Asp710 side chain is the neighbor to the transiently phosphorylated residue Asp369 in a negatively charged surface of the domain. However, the role of the TGDGVND segment for binding of ATP or Mg2+ and its participation in the conformational transitions remain uncertain. The aim of the present work has been to establish structure-function relationships for the708TGDGVNDSPALKK720 segment, in particular concerning its role in coordination of Mg2+ or in binding of free ATP.Figure 6Effect of mutations of Asp710 or Asn713 on Mg2+ dependence of [3H]ouabain binding in phosphate or vanadate medium.Aliquots of about 200 μg of SDS-treated membranes were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 0.001–3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA-Tris, 3 mm Tris-phosphate, or 1 mm Tris-vanadate, 10 mm MOPS-Tris, pH 7.2, and [3H]ouabain (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, specific activity 36 Ci/mmol) and cold ouabain to final concentrations of 10 nm for wild type (●), 10 or 40 nm for D713A (♦), and 90 nm for D710A (▴).

The Asp712 → Asn mutation could be phosphorylated to 60% of wild type levels, whereas Asp716 → Asn was expressed without catalytic activity (9Lane L.K. Feldmann J.M. Flarsheim C.E. Rybczynski C.L. J.

Dupont Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and because mutation of Asp710 in the α-subunit of renal Na,K-ATPase did not interfere with free ATP binding (12Jorgensen P.L. Rasmussen J.H. Nielsen J.M. Pedersen P.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 834: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Contributions of Asp710 and Asp714 to coordination of Mg2+ was also proposed in attempts at modeling the active site of cation ATPases on the dehalogenase fold (13Ridder I.S. Dijkstra B.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In phosphoserine phosphatase, mutation of Asp179 in the sequence 178-GDGATD decreased Mg2+ affinity about 10-fold, whereas mutation of Asp183 did not interfere with Mg2+ binding (14Collet J.F. Stroobant V. Schaftingen E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33985-33990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For establishing structure-function relationships of the708TGDGVNDSPALKK720 segment in Na,K-ATPase, it is a problem that mutations in this segment elicit the unfolded protein response (15Chapman R. Sidrauski C. Walter P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 459-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and cause proteolytic degradation in yeast (16Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Using modified growth media and fermentation protocols with reduced temperatures (15 °C) during galactose-induced Na,K-pump synthesis, these mutations can be expressed in amounts sufficient for assay of high affinity binding of free ATP at equilibrium and interactions with Mg2+ (17Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2514-2522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the present work 14 mutations were introduced in the 708TGDGVNDSPALKK720 segment, and 11 of these mutations were expressed in yeast in yields sufficient for analysis of their ligand binding properties. Mutations of Asp714 were devoid of catalytic activity. Mutations of Asp710 and Asn713 reduced Na,K-ATPase activity without interfering with ATP binding. Assays were therefore developed to determine affinities of Mg2+ ions for activation of the transfer of γ-phosphate from ATP to form the Mg·E1P[3Na] complex in the presence of oligomycin and for formation of the Mg·E2·phosphate or Mg·E2·vanadate complexes with ouabain. Tl+binding and K+-ATP antagonism were assayed to look for changes in cation binding or in conformational equilibrium. The results show that Asp710 and Asn713 are important for coordination of Mg2+ in E1P, but transition to E2P involves a shift of Mg2+ coordination away from Asp710 and Asn713. In the E2P form, the two residues are more important for hydrolysis of the acyl phosphate bond at Asp369. Mutations of Asp710and Asp714 were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis according to Ho et al. (18Ho N.S. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The resulting polymerase chain reaction fragments were digested with BamHI andEagI and inserted into similarly digested pPAP1933 (17Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2514-2522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The remaining mutations were constructed by oligonucleotide cassette mutagenesis (16Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of all polymerase chain reaction fragments was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. Yeast cells were transformed according to Gietz et al. (19Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2863) Google Scholar). Transformed yeast cells were grown in an Applikon fermentor equipped with an ADI 1030 Bio Controller and connected to a computer running the BioXpert program. Growth of yeast cells expressing wild type Na,K-ATPase at 30 °C, and Na,K-pump protein synthesis induced with galactose was performed as before (17Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2514-2522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Yeast cells producing all other mutations were grown at 30 °C until all glucose was metabolized, transferred to 15 °C for 30 min, and then induced with 2% galactose (16Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Yeast cells were harvested 48 h later. Isolation of crude membranes, SDS treatment of membranes at 0.2–0.3 mg of SDS per ml, and protein analysis were performed as described previously (17Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2514-2522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Assay at 3 mmATP, 130 mm Na+, 20 mmK+ was performed as before (17Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H.

Assay at 25 μm ATP, 130 mm Na+, and 2 mm K+ were done in a recording spectrophotometer as described before (20Jorgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2889-2897Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The binding of these was done as described previously (17Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16085-16093Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At each concentration of ATP, specific binding was estimated as the binding in NaCl minus that in KCl. In plots of specific ATP or ouabain binding versus ligand concentration, lines were fitted using Sigmaplot 4.0 (Jandel Scientific) by nonlinear least squares regression analysis to the Michaelis-Menten equation: Specific ATP binding (pmol/mg of protein) =a × [ATP]/(c + [ATP]), in whicha is the maximum ATP binding, and c is the dissociation constant, K D. These were done as described before (22Pedersen P.A. Nielsen J.M. Rasmussen J.H. Jørgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17818-17827Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Free Mg2+ was calculated using the Bad Chelator program (23Marks P.W. Maxfield F.R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is seen from TableI that functional expression was achieved for all mutations except for Thr708 → Ser and substitutions of Asp714 for Asn or Ala. The ouabain binding capacities were 4.5–26 pmol/mg of protein and in the same range as the concentrations of α-subunit protein as estimated from Western blot analysis (not shown) on crude membranes, except for mutations of Asp714. For mutations of Asp714 to Asn or Ala, the proteins were expressed to 4.5–8.5 pmol of α-subunit/mg of protein, but they were devoid of all the catalytic properties that have been examined in this work. This complete absence of catalytic activity agrees with previous analysis of the Asp714 → Asn mutation in Na,K-ATPase and mutations of the homologous residue in Ca-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum, Asp707 (9Lane L.K.

The capacities and affinities of ouabain binding are average values for three or more consecutive preparations. Data are estimated by nonlinear regression analysis of binding at a series of [3H]ouabain concentrations as in Fig. 2. Data in Table I show that the dissociation constants for ouabain in vanadate medium of mutations of Thr708, Asn713, Ser715, Lys719, and Lys720 were 3.5–12 nm and close to the value for wild type enzyme (K D = 3.5–5 nm). Mutations of Asp710 caused serious reductions of the affinity for ouabain, by 5- to 7-fold in Asp710 → Asn and 20- to 30-fold in the Asp710 → Ala mutation (Fig.2 and Table I). Below, it is examined if the reduction of ouabain affinities is due to a change in conformational equilibrium or to interference with binding of ligands that are required for high affinity ouabain binding. It is seen from Table I that Na,K-ATPase activities were severely reduced in mutations of Thr708, Asp710, Asn713, and Asp714, both at high and low ATP concentrations in the assay. In the remaining mutations, activities at 3 mm ATP were moderately reduced or unaffected, whereas the activities measured at 25 μm ATP were further reduced for mutations of Ser715, Lys719, and Lys720. Assay at low ATP was included to reduce background and increase the fraction of ouabain-sensitive activity. The ATP binding assays repeatedly showed that the affinity of Na,K-ATPase for binding of ATP is much higher than that of the background H-ATPase in the yeast membranes (ATP binding in K+ medium, not shown). The fraction of ouabain-sensitive Na,K-ATPase activity over background in the coupled assay at low ATP (25 μm) and K+ (2 mm) was therefore more than 3-fold higher (33% in wild type) than in the assay at high ATP (3 mm) and K+ (20 mm). Comparison of data in Tables I and II shows that the capacities for binding of ATP at equilibrium were close to those of ouabain binding for the mutations in the conserved segment. The dissociation constants for ATP binding in the mutations of Thr708, Ser715, and Lys720 were not significantly different from wild type (TableII). A reduction of capacity and a moderate increase of the affinity for ATP were seen for the Lys719 → Arg mutation (Table II).Table IICapacities and affinities for ATP binding after substitutions of Thr 708 , Asp 710 , Asn 713 , Asp 714 , Ser 715 , Lys 719 , Lys 720AlleleATP bindingpmol/mgKD(nm)T708A3.4 ± 0.525 ± 13T708S0-D710A8.9 ± 0.413 ± 2D710N17.6 ± 0.519 ± 2N713A15.3 ± 0.534 ± 3N713Q12 ± 126 ± 5D714A0-D714N0-S715A22 ± 139 ± 7S715T11.6 ± 0.528 ± 4K719A5.9 ± 0.443 ± 8K719R5.4 ± 0.517 ± 6K720A7 ± 141 ± 25K720R7.5 ± 0.428 ± 4WT13 ± 134 ± 5The capacities and affinities of ATP binding are average values for two to three consecutive preparations.

Substitution of Asp710 for Asn or Ala increased the affinity for ATP 2- to 3-fold (Fig. 2 and Table II) corresponding to an increase in Gibb's free energy of ATP binding of −2 kJ/mol (Table III). This could be due to relief of electrostatic repulsion between Asp710 and the negatively charged γ-phosphate group of ATP, but the change is 3- to 4-fold smaller than the increase of Gibb's free energy of ATP binding after substitution of the phosphorylated residue Asp369with Ala (21Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jorgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16085-16093Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To see if these changes of affinity for ATP depend on interaction between the two carboxylates, binding of free ATP at equilibrium was also determined for the double mutations of Asp369 → Ala with Asp710 → Asn or Asp710 → Ala. The binding data in Fig.3 and Table III show that these mutations had very high affinities for ATP with K D values as low as 1.8 nm. Double mutant cycle energy analysis (24Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. W. H. Freeman and Co, New York1999: 129-131Google Scholar) of the data suggested that interaction between the two carboxylate groups in the E1 conformation contributed −2.0 kJ/mol to the electrostatic repulsion between the carboxylate and phosphate groups (Table III).Table IIIEffect of single and double mutations of Asp 710 and Asp 369 on ATP binding and E1→E2conformational equilibrium as estimated from K + -ATP antagonismAlleleK ATPΔGb (ATP)K+displacement of ATP [K+]1/2K c E2K/E1KnmkJ/molμmWild type38 ± 5−39.365 ± 51563D710N19 ± 2−40.930 ± 14166D710A16 ± 1−41.331 ± 13931D369A1.8 ± 0.1−46.433 ± 110915D369A/D710N3.2 ± 0.2−45.077 ± 147071D369A/D710A1.8 ± 0.1−46.461 ± 79845Wild type38 ± 5−39.357 ± 61876N713Q27 ± 5−40.128 ± 34286N713A34 ± 3−39.617 ± 16514Estimation of K c from [K+]1/2 in Fig. 5 and K ATP values in Figs. 2 and 3 under the assumption that K p is unaltered by the mutations (20Jorgensen P.L.

Preservation of high affinity binding of free ATP allowed assays of phosphorylation in mutations of Asp710and Asn713 in the presence of 30 μmoligomycin in the medium to stabilize the Mg·E1P[3Na] complex and prevent transition to the E2P conformation. To determine apparent affinities for Mg2+ for activation of transfer of γ-phosphate to Asp369, phosphorylation was determined at saturating concentration of Na+, 150 mm NaCl minus that in 150 mm KCl, in the presence of 0.2 mm EDTA (Fig.4 A). From the plot of specific phosphorylation versus free Mg2+ in Fig.4 B, apparent Mg2+ affinity for wild type ([Mg2+]12 = 24 ± 5 μm) was close to a value of 16 μmpreviously observed for renal Na,K-ATPase (25Helmich-De Jong M.L.

A large, 27-fold, reduction of Mg2+ affinity to [Mg2+]12 = 648 ± 88 μm was observed for the Asp710 → Asn mutation. For the Asp710 → Ala mutation, phosphorylation was almost abolished. Saturation with Mg2+ could not be achieved, because specific phosphorylation was increasing in the range of 1–3 mm Mg2+ but remained below 20% of the ouabain binding capacity (Fig. 4 B). Addition of Mg2+ up to 10 mm did not raise phosphorylation above 20% of the level for ouabain binding for Asp710 → Ala. A more moderate 4-fold decrease of apparent Mg2+affinity was observed after removal of the carboxamide group of Asn713 (Fig. 4 B). The data show that the carboxylate group of Asp710 is important for"

More than 30 years since the discovery of the first member, precise biological functions for the family as a whole, or for individual members has proven elusive. The isolation of Prostate Carcinoma Tumor Antigen-1 (PCTA-1), a cDNA closely related to rat and human Galectin-8, as a surface marker associated with prostate cancer was achieved using a previously described immunological subtraction approach, Surface Epitope Masking (SEM) approach, in combination with expression screening. It appears that PCTA-1 expression is almost ubiquitous in normal human tissues and could alter in specific contexts such as transformation or metastasis. Multiple expression isoforms of PCTA-1 at the mRNA level are observed. PCTA-1 maps to 1q42-43, a locus associated with predisposition to prostate cancer. We have determined the genomic structure of PCTA-1 to account for the several observed isoforms, performed expression analysis to determine distribution in normal and transformed contexts at the RNA and protein level and conducted over-expression studies to determine effects on cellular phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2332269749,"Mammalian hepatitis B viruses encode a unique regulatory protein termed X, which is essential for infection and likely plays a role in the carcinogenic process associated with hepadnaviral infection. Among the numerous properties ascribed to X protein, two have been widely documented: promiscuous transcriptional transactivation and proapoptosis. However, full understanding of the mechanisms underlying these activities requires the identification of the genuine X partners among the multiple X-binding host proteins. Here we show that (i) mutations in X protein, which markedly alter affinity for the host protein UVDDBp127, inactivate both transactivation and proapoptosis; (ii) ectopic fusion of a functional UVDDB-binding domain to a deficient binding X mutant restored its activity; (iii) in contrast to the loss-of-binding mutants, a mutant with a strong gain-of-binding exerted trans-dominant negative effects on wt X activity and localized in the nucleus and (iv) increase in intracellular UVDDB concentration enhanced both wt X-mediated transactivation and apoptosis. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for a common upstream step in X mode of action, consisting of its productive interaction with UVDDB, via a structurally and functionally autonomous module. In addition, they underscore a nuclear location step of the viral protein that depends on its ability to bind UVDDB."
https://openalex.org/W2077617975,"SecA initiates protein translocation by interacting with ATP, preprotein, and the SecYEG membrane components. Under such conditions, it undergoes a conformational change characterized as membrane insertion, which is then followed by hydrolysis of ATP, enabling the release of the preprotein and deinsertion of SecA itself for the next cycle of reactions. Without ongoing translocation, the ATPase activity of SecA is kept very low. Previously, it was shown that the C-terminal 34-kDa domain of SecA interacts with the N-terminal 68-kDa ATPase domain to down-regulate the ATPase. Here, we show, using a deregulated SecA mutant, that the intrinsic ATPase activity is subject to dual inhibitory mechanisms. Thus, the proposed second ATP-binding domain down-regulates the ATPase activity executed by the primary ATPase domain. This regulation, within the N-terminal ATPase domain, operates independently of the C-terminal domain-mediated regulation. The absence of both the mechanisms resulted in a 50-fold elevation of translocation-uncoupled ATP hydrolysis.

The membrane-integrated SecYEG component provides a translocation pathway, and SecA drives the movement of the preprotein. SecA is a dimeric ATPase, containing 901 amino acid residues in each subunit (1Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 686-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which consists of a C-terminal 34 kDa domain and an N-terminal ATPase domain (68 kDa). The ATPase domain has two proposed ATP-binding sites (2Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the high affinity site (NBS I) and the low affinity site (NBS II). Whereas NBS I acts as the primary ATPase domain, the role of the NBS II region is less clear (2Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The reaction cycle of SecA is accompanied by its striking conformational changes, in which the SecA-preprotein complex inserts into the membrane in response to ATP binding followed by deinsertion of SecA in response to ATP hydrolysis (3Economou A. Pogliano J.A. Beckwith J. Oliver D.B. Wickner W. Cell. 1995; 83: 1171-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 4Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In this way, SecA seems to drive the movement of an ∼20-amino acid segment of preprotein into the membrane (5Schiebel E. Driessen A.J. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The insertion of SecA was originally defined by thein vitro generation of a 30-kDa C-terminal fragment that was protected by membrane from proteolysis (4Economou A. Wickner W.

It was shown later that some N-terminal portions of SecA insert as well, because they were also protected from an external protease (7Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5574-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) or accessible from the periplasmic side (8Ramamurthy V. Oliver D. J. Biol.

Cell. 1990; 60: 271-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Although its intrinsic activity is very low, it is activated significantly by membranes or anionic phospholipids; the latter activity is called “membrane ATPase.” In the presence of both a preprotein and membrane vesicles containing functional SecYEG complexes, ATPase activity is enhanced markedly. This activity, referred to as “translocation ATPase,” should result from the SecA reaction cycles outlined above. The present work was aimed at elucidating the mechanisms by which the intrinsic ATPase activity of SecA is kept extremely low. Previous studies (6Price A. Economou A. Duong F. Wickner W. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). pHM348 was a similar plasmid with the secA348mutation, causing an Asp-580 to Val alteration in SecA.2This mutant SecA protein is called SecAD580V in this paper. pNH14 encoded SecAD209N (with an Asp-209 to Asn alteration) and was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange mutagenesis kit, Stratagene) using the mutagenic primers 5′-GCACTATGCGCTGGTGAACGAAGTGGACTCC-3′ and its complementary strand (mutation to be introduced is underlined). pNH15 encoded SecAD580V-D209N (Asp-209 to Asn and Asp-580 to Val double mutant); an ∼800-base pair BglII-SphI segment of pHM348 was replaced by the corresponding fragment from pNH14. pNH11 encoded the N68 fragment of SecA in which the Leu-610 codon (CTG) was mutated to UAG; a BglII-MfeI segment of pKY173 was replaced by a product of polymerase chain reaction (template, pKY173; primers, 5′-AATGATTCGTAAAGATCTGCCGG-3′ and 5′-GCTTCAATTGGCTTCATACCCTATTTACGCATCATGCCGG-3′, mutation to be introduced is underlined) and BglII-MfeI digestion. pNH12 encoded SecAD580V-N68, which was constructed as above but based on pHM348. pNH13 encoded C34-His6; a polymerase chain reaction product using pKY173 as template and a set of primers, 5′-TATCCGGCATGCATCGTAAACTGGG-3′ and 5′-GCATGCTCTAGATTAATGATGATGATGATGATGTTGCAGGCGGCCATGGCACTG-3′, was digested with NsiI and XbaI and cloned into a derivative of pUC118, named pNH10, in which the first two codons oflacZα (ATGACC) were mutated to the NsiI recognition sequence (ATGCAT). Wild-type SecA was overproduced from pKY173 in strain GN45 (a MC4100 derivative carryingleu-82::Tn10 and F′ lacIQlacPL8 lacZ + Y + A +) as described previously (14Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). SecAD580V was similarly overproduced from pHM348 in a GN45 equivalent strain with the chromosomalsecA348 and secY205 mutations. SecAD209N and SecAD580V-D209N were overproduced from pNH13 and pNH14, respectively, in strain CK4706 (F-ΔlacU araD rpsL relA thi zab::Tn10 secA853–128) (17McFarland L. Francetic O. Kumamoto C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2255-2262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) harboring pSTD343 (a pACYC184-derived plasmid carryinglacI). 3Y. Akiyama, personal communication. Thus, the mutant forms of SecA were overproduced either in cells having the identical secA allele both on the chromosome and on plasmid or in the presence of a chromosomally encoded SecA variant that was easily distinguishable from the SecA species to be purified. SecA proteins were purified as described previously by Mitchell and Oliver (2Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). N68 domains from wild-type SecA and from SecAD580V were overproduced from pNH11 and pNH12, respectively, in strain AD16 (Δpro-lac thi/F' lacIQ ZM15Y + pro + ) (18Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and purified essentially as described by Karamanou et al. (12Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), except that a phenyl-Superose column was used in place of phenyl-Sepharose and a MonoQ 5/5 column was used in place of Fast Flow Q-Sepharose. The His6-tagged C34 domain of SecA was overproduced from pNH13 in strain AD16 by culturing the cells in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside for 2 h. Cells were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonylfluoride and disrupted by sonication. The sample was then ultracentrifuged at 45,000 rpm for 30 min (Beckman, Ti-70 rotor), and supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column, which was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl and then eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mimidazole, 0.5 m NaCl. Intrinsic ATPase activity of SecA was assayed by means of the coupled enzyme reactions (19Tokuda H. Yamanaka M. Mizushima S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 195: 1415-1421Google Scholar). In this assay, ADP, the product of ATP hydrolysis, was recycled back to ATP by the coupled reactions of pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, in which the accompanying NADH consumption was followed spectroscopically. The reaction at 37 °C was started by the addition of a purified preparation of SecA (2–10 μg) to 200 μl of reaction mixture that consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgSO4, 3 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 0.25 mm NADH, 5 units of pyruvate kinase, 7.5 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and 1 mm (or other indicated concentrations) ATP. Absorbance at 340 nm due to NADH was monitored in real time. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was calculated from the linear phase of the decrease inA 340. We isolated a number of secA mutations as suppressors against cold-sensitive SecY defect caused by either the secY205(14Matsumoto G. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6384-6393Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Nakatogawa H. Mori H. Matsumoto G. Ito K. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 1071-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 16Matsumoto, G., Nakatogawa, H., Mori, H., and Ito, K. (2000) Genes Cells, in press.Google Scholar) or the secY39 (20Baba T. Jacq A. Brickman E. Beckwith J. Taura T. Ueguchi C. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7005-7010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)2 mutation. Many of these mutations proved to be omnipotent in that they suppressed a number of different secY and other sec mutations. This class of mutant SecA proteins that we examined all possessed increased intrinsic and membrane ATPase activities; they are called super-active variants. The suppressor secAalterations were found to cluster within or adjacent to NBS II, the proposed low affinity ATP-binding domain of SecA. We characterized one such secA mutant, secA348, to understand the mechanisms of SecA regulation. This mutant had an amino acid alteration at Asp-580 (to Val), a hot spot for the super-active suppressor mutations (16Matsumoto, G., Nakatogawa, H., Mori, H., and Ito, K. (2000) Genes Cells, in press.Google Scholar).2 The wild-type and the mutant forms of SecA were overproduced and purified to characterize their enzymatic activities. Measurements of ATP hydrolysis in the presence of varying concentrations of the substrate (Fig. 1) showed that the V max of the intrinsic ATPase reaction was more than 10 times higher for SecAD580V than for the wild-type SecA (27.5 versus 2.2 nmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/nmol of SecA-monomer). In contrast, the mutant enzyme had an ∼3-fold higher apparent K m value than the wild type (25.9 versus 8.4 μm). Thus, the mutational alteration only slightly affects the affinity for ATP but greatly enhances the rate of translocation-uncoupled ATP hydrolysis in the presence of sufficient concentrations of ATP. Although ATPase catalytic activity of SecA is supposed to be carried out by NBS I, the presence of the residue altered by thesecA348 mutation within NBS II raised a question of whether the mutationally enhanced ATPase activity was executed by NBS I or by NBS II itself. To examine this point, a known alteration in NBS I, Asp-209 to Asn (D209N), was combined with the D580V alteration. A previous study by Mitchell and Oliver (2Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) showed that the D209N alteration inactivated the translocation ATPase activity but did not crucially affect the binding of the nucleotide. However, the intrinsic and membrane ATPase activities were unchanged or apparently enhanced, respectively, by this mutation (2Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The D209N form of SecA as well as the D580V-D209N double mutant form were purified, and their intrinsic ATPase activities were measured. As shown in Fig.2, the introduction of the D209N alteration into SecAD580V strikingly lowered the activity (Fig. 2, compare open circles and crosses). Now, the activity was identical with that of the D209N single mutant protein (Fig. 2, open triangles). Thus, the D580V effect was suppressed completely by the D209N amino acid change. As observed previously (2Mitchell C. Oliver D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 483-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), the intrinsic ATPase activity of the wild-type protein was no higher than that observed for the D209N mutant protein. These results indicates that the NBS I domain function is required for the enhanced ATPase activity observed in the SecAD580V mutant form of SecA with alteration in the NBS II region. The latter domain may have a regulatory role against the ATPase activity executed by the former domain. Previous studies show that the SecA ATPase is down-regulated by an intramolecular domain interaction (6Price A. Economou A. Duong F. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31580-31584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Song M. Kim H. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 1010-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), in which the C-terminal 34-kDa domain acts as a negative regulatory element, termed IRA (12Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This regulation was reconstituted by combining separately the purified N-terminal 68-kDa domain and the C-terminal 34-kDa domain (12Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Given this mechanism, two possibilities are conceivable for the mechanism responsible for the D580V enhancement of the ATPase activity. First, the NBS II region normally down-regulates the NBS I activity, and the mutation impairs this regulation. Second, the IRA action is mediated by its interaction with the NBS II region, leading to the inhibition of the NBS I ATPase activity, and the mutation abolishes the IRA-NBS II interaction. As reported by Price et al. (6Price A. Economou A. Duong F. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31580-31584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), mild trypsin treatment activates the intrinsic ATPase activity of SecA by cleaving it at a boundary between the N-terminal ATPase and the C-terminal regulatory domains. We observed about 6-fold elevation of the wild-type ATPase activity upon trypsin treatment (data not shown). When the SecAD580V mutant protein was similarly treated, the activity, which was already ∼8-fold higher than the wild-type enzyme, was further stimulated ∼6-fold (data not shown). This result suggested that the negative regulation by the C-terminal domain was still operating for the full-length mutant enzyme. It in turn suggested that the altered N-terminal domain itself had the increased ATPase activity. To substantiate this point, we constructed clones encoding the N-terminal 68-kDa fragment either with the wild-type sequence (SecA-N68) or with the D580V alteration (SecAD580V-N68), as well as the C-terminal 34-kDa fragment (C34). These fragments were purified using published procedures (12Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). SecA-N68 had ATPase activity that was ∼10-fold higher than the intact protein (Fig.3 A). Whereas the full-length SecAD580V preparation used in Fig. 3 was already ∼8-fold higher in the ATPase activity than in the wild type, SecAD580V-N68 showed a further 5.6-fold elevation over the SecAD580V full-length molecule (Fig. 3 A). Thus, SecAD580V-N68 was 4.5-fold higher than SecA-N68 and 47-fold higher than the intact wild-type SecA in its activity to hydrolyze ATP. We then examined whether the inhibitory action of the C34 fragment was still observed against SecAD580V-N68. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the addition of increasing concentrations of C34 resulted in increasing extents of inhibition of the N68 ATPase activity (solid circles) as reported previously (12Karamanou S. Vrontou E. Sianidis G. Baud C. Roos T. Kuhn A. Politou A.S. Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 1133-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). When ATPase activity of SecAD580V-N68 was examined similarly, it was also inhibited by C34 (Fig. 3 B, open circles). The dose-response curves of C34 against the wild-type N68 and SecAD580V-N68 were nearly identical (Fig. 3 B). Physical interactions between C34 and N68 were examined by mixing either wild-type N68 or SecAD580V-N68 with C34 having a C-terminally attached hexahistidine tag (Fig. 3 C). Upon nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography, not only N68 but also SecAD580V-N68 was co-eluted with C34-His6 with imidazole. From these results, we conclude that the inter-domain interaction remained unimpaired in the SecAD580V mutant form of SecA. Thus, in the normal SecA protein, the C-terminal domain-dependent regulation is superimposed on the regulation within the N68 ATPase domain. According to the insertion/deinsertion model (4Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), ATP binding induces the membrane insertion of the SecA-preprotein complex, whereas hydrolysis of ATP occurs only after the above process. Consistent with this model, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog can drive insertion of about 20 residues of preprotein into the membrane (5Schiebel E. Driessen A.J. Hartl F.U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Thus, initiation of translocation is a prerequisite for the SecA-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Indeed, intrinsic ATPase of SecA, in the absence of preprotein and membrane, is kept very low. Although the SecA ATPase activity is stimulated significantly by the presence of membranes or anionic phospholipids (membrane ATPase), it is enhanced dramatically by the presence of both preprotein and SecYEG membrane vesicles (translocation ATPase). The present study has focused on the problem of how the intrinsic ATPase activity was kept extremely low in the normal SecA protein. Such information will then be directly relevant to the problem of how this ATPase is activated in the presence of preproteins and the SecYEG integral membrane channel components. We have shown in this paper that SecA ATPase is down-regulated by dual regulatory mechanisms that work independently. The SecAD580V alteration of Asp580 strikingly enhances the translocation-uncoupled ATP hydrolysis activity of SecA. The enhanced activity can be ascribed to the catalysis carried out by the NBS I ATPase site, because the Asp-209 to Asn mutation of the Walker motif in NBS I abolishes it. Because the D580V mutational effect was observed with the isolated N68 fragment, the NBS II region appears to have a direct role in down-regulating the NBS I activity. According to Ramamurthy and Oliver (8Ramamurthy V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23239-23246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the NBS II region is included in or close to the regions that are accessible from the periplasmic side of the membrane under certain conditions. It is possible that, when SecA is in the resting state, the NBS II region interacts with the NBS I catalytic region to suppress the intrinsic ATP hydrolysis. Binding of ATP and preprotein as well as interaction with the SecYEG channel components will then trigger the conformational changes of SecA leading to its “membrane-inserted” state (7Eichler J. Wickner W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5574-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 8Ramamurthy V. Oliver D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23239-23246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This conformational change will simultaneously allow the dissociation of NBS II from NBS I and the resulting release of the inhibition of ATP hydrolytic activity. In the SecAD580V mutant protein, the alteration in the central region in NBS II may disturb the NBS II-NBS I interaction that is required for down-regulating the NBS I ATPase. Thus, in the super-active class of SecA mutants, the ATPase activation step is bypassed, which may make the mutant SecA work better than wild-type SecA in combination with a partially defective channel component that only poorly activates SecA. The regulatory mechanism that operates within the N68 ATPase domain is not the sole mechanism that regulates the intrinsic ATPase of SecA. Our results indicate that the IRA-mediated regulation works independently. The 34-kDa C-terminal regulatory domain largely overlaps the 30-kDa membrane insertion domain of SecA (6Price A. Economou A. Duong F. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31580-31584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, a mechanism similar to that discussed above for the regulatory function of NBS II can be considered for the down-regulation exerted by the C-terminal domain as well; only under the active translocation conditions, the IRA region dissociates from the ATPase domain because of membrane insertion of the 30-kDa domain. SecA ATPase is fully activated under the conditions in which both the C-terminal region and the central NBS II region are engaged in the translocation-driving reactions. Our results demonstrate that in the absence of both the NBS II-mediated and the IRA-mediated regulatory mechanisms, intrinsic SecA ATPase activity is ∼50-fold as high as the wild-type resting activity. The dual regulatory mechanisms may have evolved to avoid such futile consumption of ATP and to couple ATP hydrolysis effectively with polypeptide movement across the membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2328109907,"Sialomucin complex (SMC, rat Muc4) is a membrane mucin implicated in the protection of epithelia and the metastasis of some tumors. It is a heterodimeric complex, containing a mucin subunit with anti-adhesive activity and a transmembrane subunit with epidermal growth factor-like domains, one of which acts as an intramembrane ligand for ErbB2. Serum, insulin and insulin-like growth factor, but not epidermal growth factor, induce the expression of sialomucin complex in mammary epithelial cells. Induction correlates with sustained, but not transient, activation of extracellular-regulated protein kinase (ERK). MEK inhibitor U0126 blocked the induction, while activated MEK-1 transfected into a rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell line induced a sustained activation of ERK and up-regulated SMC/Muc4 expression. Northern and Western blotting indicated that up-regulation occurred concomitantly at the transcript and protein levels, both of which could be blocked by U0126. These results suggest that expression of SMC/Muc4 in mammary epithelial cells is regulated by selected growth factors through an ERK-dependent pathway at the transcript level."
