https://openalex.org/W2023546642,"A given stimulus can induce a pleasant or unpleasant sensation depending on the subject's internal state. The word alliesthesia is proposed to describe this phenomenon. It is, in itself, an adequate motivation for behavior such as food intake or thermoregulation. Therefore, negative regulatory feedback systems, based upon oropharingeal or cutaneous thermal signals are peripheral only in appearance, since the motivational component of the sensation is of internal origin. The internal signals seem to be complex and related to the set points of some regulated variables of the ""milieu interieur,"" like set internal temperature in the case of thermal sensation (15). Alliesthesia can therefore explain the adaptation of these behaviors to their goals. Only three sensations have been studied- thermal, gustatory, and olfactory, but it is probable that alliesthesia also exists in such simple ways as in bringing a signal, usually ignored, to the subject's attention. For example, gastric contractions, not normally perceived, are felt in the state of hunger (16). Since alliesthesia relies on an internal input, it is possible that alliesthesia exists only with sensations related to some constants of the ""milieu interieur"" and therefore would not exist in visual or auditory sensations. As a matter of fact, luminous or auditory stimuli can be pleasing or displeasing in themselves, but there seems to be little variation of pleasure in these sensations, that is, no alliesthesia. There may be some esthetic value linked to these stimuli but it is a striking coincidence that they are in themselves rather neutral and that it is difficult to imagine a constant of the ""milieu interieur"" which could be possibly modified by a visual or an auditive stimulus-such as light of a certain wavelength or sound of a given frequency. In the light of this theory, it is possible to reconsider the nature of the whole conscious experience. The existence of alliesthesia implies the presence of internal signals modifying the concious sensations aroused from peripheral receptors. It is therefore necessary to question the existence of sensations aroused by direct stimulation of central receptors, such as hypothalamic temperature detectors, osmoreceptors, and others. Does their excitation arouse sensations of their own, or does the sensation have to pass through peripheral senses? Only human experimentation could answer this question. In the same way, it is possible that selfstimulation of the brain is pleasant, not by giving a sensation in itself, but because the electrical stimulus (17), renders peripheral stimuli pleasant."
https://openalex.org/W1567844991,Abstract A procedure is described for the radioactive labeling of proteins in vitro in which 3H- or 14C-methyl groups are attached to the protein amino groups by reductive alkylation. Several proteins and several viruses have been labeled to specific activities of typically 5 x 106 cpm per mg of protein. Some applications are illustrated.
https://openalex.org/W2112625833,"The early-stage annual rings in otoliths from some cold-temperate fish consist of thin growth bands, the number of which corresponds to that of the days in a year. This indicates that growth takes place by daily increments. Other recurrent patterns show a fortnightly and monthly periodicity. Spawning rings are microscopically distinguishable from winter rings."
https://openalex.org/W1993738089,"Single or repeated intraventricular injections of 6-hydroxydopamine caused marked and long-lasting deficits in brain self-stimulation and other rewarded behaviors in the rat. The behavioral deficits, as well as the depletion of brain norepinephrine induced by 6-hydroxydopamine, were prevented by prior treatment with chlorpromazine. Episodic or continuous formation of endogenous 6-hydroxydopamine in man as a result of a genetically determined enzymatic error could selectively damage the binding capacity and, eventually, the structural integrity of the noradrenergic reward mechanism. Such damage might cause the fundamental symptoms and long-term downhill course of schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2072948401,"Both thymus and bone marrow cells of adult mice can be made specifically unresponsive to human gamma globulin, but each cell population displays a distinct kinetic pattern for both the induction and spontaneous loss of the unresponsive state. These kinetics appear to be much slower in the bone marrow cells than in the thymus cells. In addition, the dose of deaggregated human gamma globulin needed to induce unresponsiveness in bone marrow cells is much greater than that needed to induce unresponsiveness in thymus cells. Apparently, unresponsiveness in only one cell type is sufficient for the tolerant state to be exhibited by the intact animal."
https://openalex.org/W2047588582,"Previous attempts to phosphorylate nucleosides by heating with inorganic phosphate succeeeded only when acid phosphates such as Ca(HPO(4))(2) were used. The addition of urea and ammonium chloride to the reaction mixture permits phosphorylation in high yield with neutral or basic phosphates at temperatures in the range of 65 degrees to 100 degrees C. Since the abundant mineral, hydroxylapatite, is a satisfactory substrate for this reaction, we believe that this procedure plausible model for prebiotic phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1558826859,Abstract Extracts of mammalian cells contain a 3.3 S deoxynucleotidyltransferase activity in addition to the 6 to 8 S DNA polymerase. The 3.3 S enzyme extracted from rabbit bone marrow uses template information for nucleotide selection and is therefore a DNA polymerase and not a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The 3.3 S enzyme also differs from the 6 to 8 S DNA polymerase in its behavior on phosphocellulose and its optimum activity at alkaline pH.
https://openalex.org/W1544756659,"Abstract The subunit structures of plasma and platelet factor XIII have been compared. Plasma factor XIII contains 2 different subunits, each with a molecular weight of 81,000. The 2 subunits are well resolved on analysis of unreduced factor XIII by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. One subunit, designated the a chain, contains no detectable carbohydrate, and on activation of factor XIII with thrombin its molecular weight drops to about 77,000. The other subunit, designated as b chain, contains carbohydrate and its molecular weight does not change on activation of factor XIII with thrombin. The a and b chains have markedly different amino acid compositions. Platelet factor XIII contains only one type of subunit, which is indistinguishable from the a chain of plasma factor XIII in its amino acid composition, lack of carbohydrate, and molecular weight, before and after thrombin activation. The pattern of fibrin cross-linking produced by either the plasma or platelet factor is identical."
https://openalex.org/W1580009330,"Abstract Sulfite oxidase (EC 1.8.3.1), when reduced by sulfite, exhibited the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of molybdenum(V). Specific colorimetric analyses demonstrated that the purified enzyme contained 1 molybdenum per heme. The electron paramagnetic resonance signal of molybdenum, which was generated by the addition of sulfite, was enriched by the purification procedure to the same degree as was the sulfite-reducible heme and the sulfite oxidase activity. Incubation of the enzyme with 5 x 10-3 m arsenite produced parallel losses of the sulfite-inducible molybdenum signal and the catalytic activity. Incubation of the enzyme with cyanide in the presence of sulfite resulted in slow, progressive, and irreversible inactivation. This treatment also caused a concomitant and proportional loss of the molybdenum signal. Cyanide had no effect on the absorption spectrum of the enzyme in the visible or near ultraviolet regions of the spectrum. Whereas the heme prosthetic group of the enzyme was oxidized in the steady state achieved by the simultaneous presence of sulfite and ferricyanide, the molybdenum component was in the reduced (pentavalent) state. Examination of the molybdenum signal as a function of pH, showed a shift in the field strength of maximum energy absorption, and a change in the shape of the signal. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of the enzyme in D2O at pD 7.5 and at pD 9.6 demonstrated that the environment of the unpaired electron was axially symmetrical at the lower pD but was asymmetrical at the more alkaline pD."

These agents may osmotically shrink barrier cells, possibly the vascular endothelium, and reversibly open spaces between them. Lipid-soluble nonelectrolytes damage the barrier irreversibly."
https://openalex.org/W1589373559,"Abstract The linear amino acid sequence of the two chains of bovine thyrotropin (TSH-α and TSH-β) have been determined except for assignment of some amides. The order of the tryptic peptides of TSH-β (described in the preceding publication) was established by studies on the peptides obtained from tryptic hydrolysates of maleylated, reduced, S-carboxymethyl TSH-β, and from the oxidized chain. The preparations of TSH-β exhibited heterogeneity at the COOH terminus; molecules of 113 residues terminate with the tripeptide sequence -Ser-Tyr-Met-COOH while others, of 112 residues terminate with -Ser-Tyr-COOH. Evidence for the heterogeneity of the NH2 terminus of TSH-α was again found in the peptides from its maleylated derivative. The molecular weight, calculated from the amino acid sequences and carbohydrate compositions, of TSH-α preparations is approximately 13,600, that of TSH-β preparations, 14,700. TSH-α contains two oligosaccharide moieties, TSH-β one. Both chains are extremely rich in intrachain disulfide bonds, five in TSH-α and six in TSH-β; their positions remain to be determined. There are no interchain disulfide bonds. The sequences of TSH-α and -β do not resemble each other superficially, but several very similar or identical sequences are found in TSH-β and in the hormone-specific chain, CII, of luteinizing hormone, despite marked differences in their amino acid compositions. The sequence of the latter has been announced recently by Liu et al. (Res. Commun. Chem. Path. Pharmacol., 1, 463 (1970)). The similarities may be a reflection of similar sites on the hormone-specific chains for interactions with the nearly identical subunits, TSH-α and CI of luteinizing hormone, which lead to the active hormones."
https://openalex.org/W1505888174,"The complete amino acid sequence of chicken egg white avidin has been elucidated from sequence studies on 4 cyanogen bromide peptides and 15 tryptic peptides obtained from the protein. Avidin consists of four essentially identical polypeptide chains, each containing 128 amino acid residues with a carbohydrate moiety attached at asparaginyl Residue 17. Each chain has NH2-terminal alanine, COOH-terminal glutamic acid, and an intrachain disulfide bond between Residues 4 and 83, but approximately half of the chains have isoleucine at Residue 34, and the other half have threonine at this position. No other evidence of heterogeneity in the sequence was found. The cyanogen bromide reaction with avidin represents another example of partial cleavage at Met-Ser or Met-Thr bonds, despite quantitative conversion of the methionyl residue to a homoseryl residue."
https://openalex.org/W1607443715,"Human proinsulin C-peptide has been extracted from human pancreas with acid-ethanol and purified by means of gel filtration, carboxymethyl-cellulose chromatography, paper electrophoresis, and partition chromatography. The purified material was judged to be about 98% pure by compositional analysis. Amino acid sequence analysis was carried out on the intact C-peptide and fragments derived by hydrolysis with chymotrypsin and thermolysin. On the basis of these results, and in accord with the compositional stoichiometry, the following 31-residue amino acid sequence is proposed: Glu-Ala-Glu-Asp-Leu-Gln-Val-Gly-Gln-Val-Glu-Leu-Gly-Gly-Gly-Pro-Gly-Ala-Gly-Ser-Leu-Gln-Pro-Leu-Ala-Leu-Glu-Gly-Ser-Leu-Gln. Although sufficient human proinsulin has not been available thus far for detailed structural studies, the probable identity of this pancreatic C-peptide with the corresponding region of human proinsulin is supported by both compositional and immunological studies on human proinsulin. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the bovine, porcine, and human C-peptides reveals homology but also much greater variability in both length and sequence than occurs among the insulins in these species. The conformation and role in peptide chain folding of the connecting polypeptide region of proinsulin is evaluated in the light of these findings."

https://openalex.org/W1525104650,"Pancreatic lipase is rapidly and irreversibly inactivated at a hexadecane-water interphase. The unfolded protein is only very slowly, in the course of hours or days, released into the aqueous phase. Bile salts prevent the denaturation of the lipase. Bovine albumin also protects the enzyme. Denaturation of lipase occurs also at the interphase of the substrates, tributyrin or olive oil, and water. Kinetic studies show that taurocholate and albumin prevent but cannot reverse the unfolding of the enzyme. The accelerating effect that these agents have on lipolysis can be explained on this basis. It is concluded that it is one of the functions of bile salts, and of proteid cofactors, to protect the native structure of lipase and to keep the oil-water interphase free from blockage by unfolded proteins. Despite its preferential specificity for insoluble triglycerides, lipase is not better adapted to an existence at the oil-water interphase than other enzymes. The enzyme requires isolation from rather than binding to the hydrophobic moieties of its substrates, and it relies on the help of surfactants for the prevention of hydrophobic bonding and unfolding. This interpretation is in harmony with previous evidence for the lack of lipophilic bonding in the substrate-enzyme complex."
https://openalex.org/W1573907714,"Sulfite oxidase (sulfite:O2 oxidoreductase EC 1.8.3.1) was purified 1000-fold from acetone powdered bovine liver and shown to be 65 to 80% pure by several criteria including disc gel electrophoresis, sedimentation velocity, and gel exclusion chromatography. The molecular weight of the enzyme was found to be 115,000 by the method of sedimentation equilibrium and it was shown to be composed of subunits, whose molecular weight was estimated by acrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, and found to be 55,000. The rate of sedimentation of the enzyme in dilute phosphate buffer at 20° was 5.8 S. The absorption spectrum of the enzyme exhibited a broad band centered at 530 nm with a shoulder at 560 nm and a sharp peak at 413 nm. Upon reduction of the enzyme with sulfite, absorption maxima were seen at 555, 526, 423, and 325 nm. The enzyme was found to contain heme which was quantitated as the pyridine-hemochromogen. Each molecule of enzyme contained 2 molecules of heme. Several lines of evidence indicated that the heme was a prosthetic group of the enzyme. Heme content and sulfite oxidase activity were enriched in parallel during the purification procedure. Heme and sulfite oxidase activity migrated identically when subjected to disc gel electrophoresis and sedimentation in a centrifugal field. In addition, when the enzyme was heated, its heme lost the ability to be reduced by sulfite and there was a concurrent and proportional loss of sulfite oxidase activity. The reduction of oxygen by sulfite oxidase exhibited an initially rapid phase which passed over into a slower and linear rate. This partial inactivation of the enzyme occurred by a first order process and correlated with reduction of half of the heme. When the sulfite was depleted, the heme reoxidized. When challenged with another aliquot of sulfite, the enzyme again exhibited the fast initial rate and the first order partial inactivation, thus demonstrating the complete reversibility of this phenomenon. The presence of sulfite did not change the sedimentation properties of sulfite oxidase. The heme of sulfite oxidase was reduced in the steady state achieved in the simultaneous presence of sulfite and oxygen, but was oxidized in the steady state when the electron acceptor was ferricyanide."

The Nauta method for impregnating degenerating axoplasm was used to reveal that degeneration resulting from lesions at quiet attack sites followed largely along the course of the medial forebrain bundle, while the degeneration after lesions of affective attack sites was concentrated more heavily in the periventricular system."
https://openalex.org/W1494095650,"Guanidination of the nine e-amino groups or picolinimidylation of the α- and e-amino groups yielded active derivatives of DNase. Since modification of the enzyme with these large substituents, which have delocalized positive charges, should have inactivated the protein if amino groups were involved in the catalytic reaction, none of the primary amino groups of DNase can be essential for catalysis. When positive charges on the enzyme were removed by carbamylation of the α-amino group and about seven e-amino groups, the protein had about half of its original activity. But the Ca++ complex of this derivative was almost fully active. Carbamylation of the remaining two amino groups inactivated DNase and Ca++ did not restore activity; therefore, the positive charges on these groups probably help to maintain the active structure of the enzyme. It is not likely that the two amino groups are involved in binding Mn++-DNA, since they do not seem to be freely available for reaction with cyanate. Trinitrophenylation gave results similar to those of carbamylation, but only one amino group of Ca++-free DNase or four to five groups of Ca++-DNase could be trinitrophenylated without inactivation. The neutral, hydrophobic trinitrophenyl groups probably distort the enzyme more than carbamyl groups do. Two to three amino groups resisted trinitrophenylation, which may also indicate that these groups have structural roles. Simplified procedures are described for the chromatographic determination of homocitrulline and for the spectrophotometric titration of free amino groups with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. The α-picolinimidyl, e-guanidino derivative of DNase A was active, and its metal-chelating picolinimidyl group could facilitate the preparation of isomorphous derivatives for x-ray studies."
https://openalex.org/W1596484246,"Abstract The tryptic peptides of reduced, S-carboxymethyl CI chain of bovine luteinizing hormone have been isolated by gel filtration and electrophoresis or chromatography on paper. The amino acid compositions of all peptides are identical with those of the α chain of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), whose sequence is described in the preceding communication. Chymotryptic-like cleavages also yielded the same peptides. Large fragments of CI chain, obtained either by cleavage with cyanogen bromide or tryptic hydrolysis of the maleylated, reduced, S-carboxymethyl derivative, were also separated, primarily by gel filtration. Although all these fractions were not completely purified, their compositions agreed well with the corresponding TSH-α fragments and the data demonstrate that the order of the tryptic peptides must be the same in both chains. Some heterogeneity was observed in various preparations of CI chain. A portion of one preparation appeared to lack the amino-terminal dipeptide, Phe-Pro, as does some TSH-α. The composition of another preparation indicated it to contain 1 less residue of phenylalanine than that studied in detail. While complete sequences of the tryptic peptides remain to be determined, the data show that the CI chain and TSH-α must have identical amino acid sequences other than minor heterogeneity or possible inversions or substitutions within the tryptic peptides. The two chains do, however, differ in their carbohydrate composition with a larger amount of mannose in the CI chain of luteinizing hormone most apparent."

https://openalex.org/W1668880997,Abstract The 8-carbon and the 7-carbon analogues of N-acetyl-neuraminic acid were necessary in order to study some of the structural requirements of N-acetylneuraminic acid in its role as substrate for certain enzymes. The 8-carbon analogue of N-acetylneuraminic acid was synthesized by the alkaline condensation of 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-lyxose and di-tert-butyloxaloacetate. This same 8-carbon compound and the 7-carbon analogue of N-acetylneuraminic acid were isolated after acid hydrolysis of Collocalia mucoid which had been modified by periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction. The two analogues could also be detected when periodate oxidation and borohydride reduction were applied to crystalline β-methoxy-N-acetylneuraminic acid methyl ester.

The release of laboratory-constructed strains differing from the field population for a number of chromosome interchanges should create an unstable situation leading to the rapid replacement of the field population.

These results support the view that the corpus luteum in this species is an estrogen-responsive tissue.
https://openalex.org/W1509760216,"Abstract Yeast phenylalanine tRNA (tRNAphe) exhibits a 4½-fold enhancement of fluorescence in response to the addition of Mg2+. Concurrently, over the same concentration range (0 to 0.4 mm) of Mg2+, the circular dichroism peak at 263 nm displays a 20% increase in ellipticity and a blue shift of 2 nm. The existence of the negative circular dichroism band at 295 nm appears to be cation-dependent. This conformational change is accompanied by a 5.4% hypochromicity and is readily observable by gel filtration. NaCl inhibits competitively the enhancement of fluorescence by Mg2+. High concentrations (2.0 m) of NaCl alone are only 47% as effective as Mg2+ in producing an increase in fluorescence. A series of organic diamines exhibits a diminishing ability to enhance the fluorescence of tRNAphe as the number of carbon atoms between the two amine groups increases. Spermine and spermidine are more effective than any of the diamines examined, but spermidine, which is the most active oligoamine tested, is only 41% as effective as Mg2+. Gel filtration results indicate that the level of fluorescence enhancement obtainable with various divalent cations corresponds qualitatively to the relative extent of folding of tRNAphe inducible by these cations. Heat denaturation of tRNAphe in the presence of Mg2+ revealed a preferential melting of the fluorescence enhancement at lower temperatures as compared with the hyperchromicity of the sample. The conformational change of tRNAphe induced by Mg2+ is interpreted to represent the formation of tertiary structure. Where comparisons are possible, yeast tRNAphe bears a close similarity to bovine liver tRNAphe in its fluorescence/conformational properties."

https://openalex.org/W1549748880,"Abstract Two forms of RNA polymerase (nucleoside triphosphate-RNA nucleotidyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.6) from Pseudomonas putida were resolved by chromatography in 50% glycerol on phosphocellulose and purified. As determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis, the subunit structures of the two forms of the enzyme were α2ββ'σ and α2ββ'. The molecular weights of α, β, β', and σ were 44,000, 155,000, 165,000, and 98,000, respectively. The sedimentation coefficients of α2ββ'σ and α2ββ' as determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation in 0.40 m potassium acetate were 13 S and 12 S, respectively, but in 0.05 m potassium acetate, the sedimentation coefficients were 19 S and 25 S. Similar results were obtained by analytical ultracentrifugation. Multiple protein bands resulted from polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis of α2ββ'σ and α2ββ'. Each band was enzymatically active in the unprimed synthesis of poly A · poly U. RNA polymerase α2ββ'σ was 4- to 5-fold more active in transcribing P. putida bacteriophage gh-1 DNA and coliphage T4 DNA than was α2ββ'. With calf thymus DNA as a template, the two forms were equally active in RNA synthesis. With denatured DNA or poly d(A-T), α2ββ' was twice as active as was α2ββ'σ. The rates of the DNA-directed polymerization reactions catalyzed by α2ββ'σ and α2ββ' were affected differently by added RNase. The initial rate of the reaction catalyzed by α2ββ'σ was increased 10%, whereas that catalyzed by α2ββ' was increased 80 to 110%."
https://openalex.org/W1499096996,"Abstract Bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase is desensitized to its allosteric inhibitor guanosine triphosphate upon reaction with tetranitromethane. The presence of GTP affords at most only a small protection against loss of the inhibitory effect of GTP. By amino acid analysis, the nitration of tyrosine appears to be the major change in the protein upon reaction with tetranitromethane and the modification most likely to be responsible for the loss of GTP inhibition. The rate of formation of 3-nitrotyrosine during the reaction of the enzyme with tetranitromethane is apparently the sum of two concurrent reactions, an initial rapid reaction which accounts for the nitration of approximately 1 tyrosyl residue per subunit chain and a slower reaction which also accounts for significant tyrosine nitration. We have identified the tyrosyl residue which is rapidly nitrated by the isolation of a single labeled peptide from a tryptic digest and by the isolation of a labeled cyanogen bromide peptide. In both cases, the modified residue proved to be tyrosine-412 according to the present tentative numbering of the polypeptide chain."

https://openalex.org/W1571093876,"From a tryptic hydrolysate of reduced and carboxymethylated egg white avidin, 16 major peptides, ranging from 2 to 17 residues, were isolated by further purification of the fractions obtained by gradient elution from Dowex 50-X2. The combined compositions of these 16 peptides, together with free lysine which was also isolated from the tryptic hydrolysate, account for 128 residues in agreement with the composition of the subunit of avidin, determined by amino acid analysis. The complete amino acid sequences of these peptides were determined, and the sequences of other peptides, resulting from secondary cleavage, were also investigated. The presence of heterogeneity in the sequence at one position was established by the isolation in approximately equal yield of two forms of the same peptide, one form with NH2-terminal threonine, and the other form with NH2-terminal isoleucine. Carbohydrate analyses of avidin and the only tryptic peptide found to contain carbohydrate gave 4 residues of glucosamine and 5 residues of mannose in each."

https://openalex.org/W1597179866,"Abstract The peptides produced from reduced S-carboxymethyl bovine thyrotropin (TSH) by hydrolysis with trypsin and by cleavage at its methionine residues with cyanogen bromide have been isolated. Partial or complete amino acid sequences of many of the tryptic peptides and of the smaller cyanogen bromide fragments have been determined. Twenty-five distinct primary tryptic peptides (of which three are glycopeptides) and free serine were recognized as well as several peptides originating from chymotryptic-like cleavages or partial cleavages of resistant bonds. Sufficient data were obtained from the studies on the composition and partial sequences of the cyanogen bromide fragments and the tryptic peptides derived from them to order 10 of the tryptic peptides plus free serine into a peptide chain of 96 residues whose composition exactly matches that of one of the recently discovered subunits of thyrotropin (TSH-α). This subunit, which is the one nearly identical with one chain of luteinizing hormone, shows heterogeneity at its NH2 terminus with some molecules lacking a Phe-Pro sequence. Seventy-six of the residues of TSH-α have been placed in sequence. Two additional large cyanogen bromide fragments, containing 49 to 53 and 51 to 53 residues, respectively, were also overlapped, and they, together with the single remaining cyanogen bromide fragment and free homoserine, accounted for the amino acid composition of TSH-β (the second of the two subunits). Only one tryptic peptide, Ser-Tyr, formerly thought to be at the COOH terminus of intact thyrotropin, could not be identified as part of a cyanogen bromide fragment. The data indicate that the two TSH subunits, while possessing quite similar amino acid compositions, have very different sequences."

Chromatographically purified bovine β-trypsin, which contains a single polypeptide chain, was treated with the water-soluble carbodiimide, 1-ethyl-3-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide, and glycinamide, according to the method of Koshland et al. (13–15). Coupling of the protein carboxyl groups with glycinamide in amide linkage resulted in nearly complete loss of the enzyme activity as determined by an esterolytic assay using Nα-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester as substrate. The extent of modification of the carboxyl groups and the extent of enzyme inactivation were found to be decreased in the presence of the competitive inhibitor benzamidine, indicating that certain essential carboxyl groups were protected from modification by the inhibitor. The carboxyl groups masked by the inhibitor were then reacted, after removal of the inhibitor by dialysis, with the carbodiimide reagent and 14C-glycinamide. After enzymatic degradation of the radioactive trypsin derivative, the labeled peptides were isolated and identified by their amino acid composition. The primary site of labeling was found to be aspartyl-177, strongly suggesting that this residue provides the anionic center for specific substrate binding. Some radioactivity was also associated with Asp-182. This residue reacted very slowly with the carbodiimide reagent, but it could be readily modified in the presence of 8 m urea, indicating that it is partially buried in the molecule. In 8 m urea, another carboxyl group, Asp-90, became available to modification. The failure of this residue to react in the native state suggests that Asp-90, which is homologous with an aspartyl residue known to be buried in chymotrypsin (21), is completely buried in the trypsin molecule. The enzyme which had been modified in the absence of benzamidine and had lost 99% of its specific esterolytic activity retained its reactivity toward diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate to a significant extent, indicating that the inactivation was due primarily to loss of the specificity site. The reaction of tyrosine with the carbodiimide was not a major cause of the inactivation because the regeneration of tyrosyl residues by hydroxylamine resulted in no significant change in the activity of modified trypsin preparations."
https://openalex.org/W1579895218,"Abstract Crystallized preparations of pancreatic deoxyribonuclease (deoxyribonucleate oligonucleotidohydrolase, EC 3.1.4.5) were further purified by gradient chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose and phosphocellulose and used to study the reversible thermal inactivation in acidic media which was originally described by Kunitz. Changes in enzymatic activity and in a typical tyrosine difference spectrum suggest that the thermal transition is an interconversion between two monomeric states. Equilibrium and kinetic data for this process were collected over a limited temperature range. Circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion results indicate that the thermal transition reflects a relatively limited disruption of structure (compared to that occurring in concentrated solutions of guanidine·HCl or urea). DNase which has undergone the thermal transition and then has been rapidly chilled exists largely as an enzymatically inactive dimer. The dimer was isolated by gel filtration; the apparent association constant is extremely large (Kassoc = 2 to 4 x 107 liters per mole at 0°)."
https://openalex.org/W2023212398,"Several reports have cast doubt on the cerebral origin of alpha and kappa electroencephalogram activity by charging that they are artifacts related to eye activity. Data are cited which eliminate the corneoretinal potential of the eyeball, tremor of the extraocular muscles, eye position, accommodation, and eye flutter as sources of alpha and kappa electroencephalogram activity. A subject with both eyes removed showed normal alpha and kappa electroencephalogram activity. Marked left-right differences in alpha activity were not found in one-eyed subjects whose eyes and extraocular muscles were completely removed on one side."
https://openalex.org/W1519609731,"The ionization of tyrosine residues in human lysozyme was investigated by measurement of spectral changes at pH values between 8.74 and 12.75. Below pH 11.70, at ionic strength 0.10, the titration curve is fully reversible. An average of 4 tyrosine eq per mole are ionized at this pH. At pH values higher than 11.70, the spectra are time-dependent. Reversal from any pH above 11.7, after 12 to 30 hours, leads to precipitation. Analysis of the results suggests that of the 6 tyrosine residues in the molecule, 3 are readily accessible and titrate as equivalent groups with pKint = 9.81. A 4th residue is inaccessible and can be titrated only after unfolding. The remaining 2 titrate with anomalously high pK values. When, on the average, more than one of these residues are ionized, a time-dependent exposure of the buried tyrosine residue occurs. A comparison of these results with the ionization behavior of the 3 tyrosine residues in hen egg white lysozyme is presented and discussed in terms of differences in the sequences of the two enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1585173965,"Abstract A method is described for the intramolecular pairing of the sulfhydryl groups in fully reduced bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase) by reaction with mercuric ions and formation of S-Hg-S cross-links. The protein derivative obtained contains 4 mercury atoms per protein molecule, sediments in the ultracentrifuge as a single symmetrical peak (s20,w = 1.81), and migrates as a single sharp band on acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The circular dichroism spectrum of the mercury derivative is consistent with the supposition that the tyrosine residue which has been found to be normalized in the RNase-mercury derivative, is tyrosine-92, although other interpretations are not excluded. The RNase-mercury derivative retains about 5% and 25% of the specific hydrolytic activity of the native enzyme towards RNA and cytidine 2',3'-cyclic monophosphate, respectively. Unlike the native protein it is digested by trypsin, although at a lower rate than oxidized RNase, with the consequence of complete loss of the enzymic activity. Both tryptic digestion and the concomitant loss of catalytic activity of the mercury derivative follow first order kinetics (trypsin concentration 10 µg per ml; initial protein concentration 0.1 mg per ml) with similar rate constants. These findings indicate that the RNase-mercury derivative is homogeneous and free of contamination by the native enzyme. It is concluded that the cysteine residues are predominantly paired in the RNase-mercury derivative in the same pattern as the cystines in native RNase, and that elongation of the internal cross-links in RNase by 3 A each does not abolish, but quantitatively modifies, the activity of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2022864192,"Female rats maintained on a diet deficient in vitamin E for a prolonged period of 100 to 135 days, starting from birth, failed to conceive in spite of repeated matings. Dietary vitamin E supplementation for a period of 60 days following prolonged deficiency was ineffective in reversing the sterility, although a definite growth response was observed. These observations suggest that the tissue damage caused by lipid peroxidation, as evidenced by distinct brown ceroid pigment in the uterus and fallopian tubes, may be responsible for the irreversible loss of fertility observed in the vitamin E-deficient female rats."
https://openalex.org/W1577410925,"Abstract Prothrombin conversion to thrombin in the biological anion and proteolytic activation systems have been explored with a water-insoluble derivative obtained from native material. Preparation of this derivative, its composition, and its stability are described. Since it is readily removable from components in interacting mixtures, the material has proven to be extremely valuable for study of several important aspects of thrombin formation. Insolubilization of prothrombin does not affect the convertibility or requirements of the activation of the precursor of thrombin. As with native material, Factors VII and X are crucial to biological and anion activation of the insoluble derivative, whereas trypsin converts it directly to thrombin, requiring no other factors. Thrombin is inert. Tissue thromboplastin somehow makes the prothrombin molecule more susceptible to activation, even after removal of the thromboplastin from the insoluble prothrombin. Concentrated anion (citrate), however, operates by activating Factor VII-X rather than affecting prothrombin itself. During activation of the insoluble derivative, thrombin clotting and esterase activities evolve, paralleled by declining prothrombin activity and concomitant appearance of trichloracetic acid-soluble, ninhydrin-reactive material. The thin layer electrophoretic profile of fragments in the latter resembled in distribution that obtained during activation of the native parent material."
https://openalex.org/W2052102530,"Administration of suspensions of Plasmodium berghei sporozoites by the oral route to groups of susceptible animals (A/J mice, young rats, hamsters, and Thamnomys) resulted in high rates of infection (66 to 100 percent). Control animals each given a suspension of 200,000 to 500,000 erythrocytes infected with P. berghei by the same oral route did not develop parasitemia. Direct intubation of sporozoite suspensions into the stomach failed to produce parasitemia. In vitro studies showed that sporozoites kept in medium M 199 acidified to pH 3.6 (the acid environment of the rat stomach) for 5 to 15 mtinutes lost their viability and infectivity. We believe that sporozoites of P. berghei find their way to the bloodstream during their brief sojourn in the esophagus."

The wastes were analyzed and were found to include lower chlorinated aliphatic compounds, vinyl esters, chlorinated aromatic amines and nitrocompounds, and the insecticide endosulfan. Because dropping these drums into the sea endangers the environment and results in damage to fishing operations, measures should be taken to stop this practice."
