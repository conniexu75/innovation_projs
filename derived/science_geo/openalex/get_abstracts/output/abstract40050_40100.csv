https://openalex.org/W1560360966,"Rabbit synovial fibroblasts induced to undergo a specific switch in gene expression by agents that alter cell morphology secreted the neutral proteinase precursor procollagenase (apparent Mr of 53,000 and 57,000). A major Mr = 51,000 polypeptide that was always induced coordinately with procollagenase has now been identified as the proenzyme form of a metal-dependent proteinase active at neutral pH. We have named this proteinase stromelysin. Prostromelysin and procollagenase were the most prominent [35S]methionine-labeled secreted proteins of the induced fibroblasts. By the use of casein degradation as an assay for enzyme activity, stromelysin was isolated with high yield from the conditioned culture medium of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-treated fibroblasts and migrated as an active form of Mr = 21,000 that was immunologically identical to the proteoglycan-degrading proteinase purified from rabbit bone. Immunoglobulin G from antiserum raised to purified rabbit bone proteoglycanase immunoprecipitated the Mr = 51,000 proenzyme form from conditioned medium of induced rabbit cells and also immunoprecipitated an Mr = 55,000 polypeptide from induced human fibroblasts. When rabbit prostromelysin was activated by trypsin or 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate, the proenzyme was converted to an active form of Mr = 41,000. During the course of the purification, prostromelysin was converted to an additional activatable form of Mr = 35,000 and additional active forms of Mr = 21,000-25,000, which had related peptide maps distinct from collagenase. All of these forms were immunologically cross-reactive. Purified stromelysin degraded casein, cartilage proteoglycans, fibronectin, alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, and immunoglobulin G2a and had limited activity on laminin, elastin, type IV collagen, and gelatin, but did not degrade type I collagen. Stromelysin was inhibited by EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, and the specific glycoprotein tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases isolated from human amniotic fluid and was therefore classified as a metalloproteinase."
https://openalex.org/W1569353770,"Fibrinogen binding to receptors on activated platelets is a prerequisite for platelet aggregation. However, the regions of fibrinogen interacting with these receptors have not been completely characterized. Fibronectin also binds to platelet fibrinogen receptors. Moreover, the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, corresponding to the cell attachment site of fibronectin, is located near the carboxyl-terminal region of the alpha-chain of fibrinogen. We have examined the ability of this tetrapeptide to inhibit platelet aggregation and fibrinogen binding to activated platelets. Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, but not the peptide Arg-Gly-Tyr-Ser-Leu-Gly, inhibited platelet aggregation stimulated by ADP, collagen, and gamma-thrombin without inhibiting platelet shape change or secretion. At a concentration of 60-80 microM, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser inhibited the aggregation of ADP-stimulated gel-filtered platelets approximately equal to 50%. Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, but not Arg-Gly-Tyr-Ser-Leu-Gly, also inhibited fibrinogen binding to ADP-stimulated platelets. This inhibition was competitive with a Ki of approximately equal to 25 microM but was incomplete even at higher tetrapeptide concentrations, indicating that Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser is a partial competitive inhibitor of fibrinogen binding. These data suggest that a region near the carboxyl-terminus of the alpha-chain of fibrinogen interacts with the fibrinogen receptor on activated platelets. The data also support the concept that the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser has been conserved for use in a variety of cellular adhesive processes."

https://openalex.org/W1555692677,"Using cloned human prealbumin cDNA as a probe, Southern blot hybridization of human genomic DNA revealed that the prealbumin gene consists of an unique, single-copy DNA. The nucleotide sequences of the entire human prealbumin gene, including both 581 base pairs of the 5'- and 95 base pairs of the 3'-flanking sequences, were determined. The gene spans about 7.0 kilobase pairs and consists of four exons and three introns. As in most eukaryotic genes, the consensus TATA and CAAT sequences are found 30 and 101 nucleotides, respectively, upstream from the putative cap site, and a polyadenylation signal sequence AA-TAAA is found in the 3'-untranslated region. Unexpectedly, two independent open reading frames provided with respective regulatory sequences were found within the gene: one in the first intron and the other in the third intron."
https://openalex.org/W1578152528,"The formation of large cholesterol-enriched high density lipoproteins (HDL1/HDLc) from typical HDL3 requires lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity, additional cholesterol, and a source of apolipoprotein (apo-) E. The present study explores the role of apo-E in promoting HDL1/HDLc formation and in imparting to these lipoprotein particles the ability to interact with the apo-B,E(low density lipoprotein (LDL] receptor. Incubation of normal canine serum with cholesterol-loaded mouse peritoneal macrophages resulted in the formation of HDL1/HDLc that competed with 125I-LDL for binding to the apo-B,E(LDL) receptors on cultured human fibroblasts. Cholesterol efflux from macrophages was necessary because incubation of normal canine serum with nonloaded macrophages did not cause HDL1/HDLc formation. However, cholesterol delivery to the serum was not sufficient to result in HDL1/HDLc formation. Apolipoprotein E had to be available. Incubation of apo-E-depleted canine serum with cholesterol-loaded J774 cells, a macrophage cell line that does not synthesize apo-E, demonstrated that no HDL1/HDLc formation was detected even in the presence of significant cholesterol efflux. However, addition of exogenous apo-E to the serum during the incubation with cholesterol-loaded J744 cells promoted the formation of large receptor-active HDL1/HDLc. The receptor binding activity of these particles produced in vitro correlated with the amount of apo-E incorporated into the HDL1/HDLc. Apolipoproteins A-I and C-III were ineffective in promoting HDL1/HDLc formation; thus, apo-E was unique in allowing HDL1/HDLc formation. These results demonstrate that when lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity, cholesterol, and apo-E are present in serum, typical HDL can be transformed in vitro into large cholesterol-rich HDL1/HDLc that are capable of binding to lipoprotein receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1547271459,"Using the membranes treated with Triton X-100, we studied the interaction between gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)B receptors and the GTP-binding proteins which are the substrates for ADP-ribosylation by the islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin. The addition of guanine nucleotides to the membranes markedly decreased the binding of GABA to GABAB receptors. Preincubation of the membranes with IAP plus NAD caused ADP-ribosylation of the 41,000- and 39,000-Da proteins selectively and decreased GABA binding to GABAB receptors in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This decrease of binding appeared to be due to the reduction of receptor affinity for agonist. The GTP-binding proteins which are ADP-ribosylated by IAP were purified from the membrane fraction of bovine cerebral cortex. The addition of the purified GTP-binding proteins to IAP-treated membranes restored the high affinity binding of GABA to GABAB receptor. The two GTP-binding proteins which were resolved by octyl-Sepharose column chromatography showed similar efficacy in restoring GABA binding. Thus, GABAB receptors are coupled to GTP-binding proteins, IAP-specific substrates, in the brain membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1581572500,"A 1-kilobase DNA fragment containing the promoter of the bovine prolactin gene was fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene and the activity of the promoter was assayed by transfection of the fusion gene into COS-1, HeLa, and GH3 cells. Transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene driven by the prolactin promoter was detected only in GH3 cells, a rat pituitary tumor cell line. Epidermal growth factor and thyroid releasing hormone produced a stimulation of transcription, and the synthetic glucocorticoid hormone dexamethasone effected an inhibition of transcription from the prolactin promoter. None of these factors significantly affected transcription of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene fused to the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. Deletion of all but 250 base pairs of bovine prolactin 5'-flanking DNA had no effect, indicating that the signals sufficient for both stimulation and inhibition of transcription reside in close proximity to the promoter."

https://openalex.org/W1571341395,"Human erythrocytes contained a soluble cytosolic epoxide hydrolase for stereospecific enzymatic hydration of leukotriene A4 into leukotriene B4. The enzyme was purified 1100-fold, to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity, by conventional DEAE-Sephacel fractionation followed by high performance anion exchange and chromatofocusing procedures. Its characteristics include a molecular weight of 54,000 +/- 1,000, an isoelectric point 4.9 +/- 0.2, a Km apparent from 7 to 36 microM for enzymatic hydration of leukotriene A4, and a pH optimum ranging from 7 to 8. The enzyme was partially inactivated by its initial exposure to leukotriene A4. There was slow but detectable enzymatic hydration (pmol/min/mg) of certain arachidonic acid epoxides including (+/-)-14,15-oxido-5,8-11-eicosatrienoic acid and (+/-)-11,12-oxido-5,8,14-eicosatrienoic acid, but not others, including 5,6-oxido-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid. Human erythrocyte epoxide hydrolase did not hydrate either styrene oxide or trans-stilbene oxide. In terms of its physical properties and substrate preference for leukotriene A4, the erythrocyte enzyme differs from previously described versions of epoxide hydrolase. Human erythrocytes represent a novel source for an extrahepatic, cytosolic epoxide hydrolase with a potential physiological role."
https://openalex.org/W1595879864,"We have isolated and partially purified an intracellular vesicle fraction from A-431 cells that contains both epidermal growth factor (EGF) and enzymatically active EGF:receptor/kinase. Exposure of intact A-431 cells to EGF leads to an accumulation of both EGF and kinase activity in this vesicle fraction. The accumulation is time- and temperature-dependent and is blocked by inhibitors of energy production. The EGF receptor in internalized vesicles is capable of autophosphorylation and, in the presence of Ca2+, of phosphorylation of the previously isolated 35-kDa protein (Fava, R. A., and Cohen, S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2636-2645). The demonstration of an EGF-induced increase in kinase activity of an internalized vesicle fraction lends credence to the hypothesis that EGF-induced endocytosis of the receptor is of physiological significance in the response of cells to this ligand. In addition, these results are consistent with the suggestion that the phosphorylation of the 35-kDa protein is associated with internalization of the EGF:receptor/kinase complex."
https://openalex.org/W212711927,"Abstract In several cell types, proliferation initiated by growth factors is associated with a rapid increase in cytoplasmic pH (pHi). This cytoplasmic alkalinization is due to the activation of an amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ antiport. It is unclear whether growth factor-induced activation of the antiport or the resultant increase in pHi is the trigger for proliferation, an obligatory requirement for proliferation, or simply an associated phenomenon. Interleukin 2 (IL 2) acts as a growth factor for mitogen or antigen-stimulated thymus-derived (T) lymphocytes. In this study, we established that IL 2 produces an increase in pHi and determined whether this increase in pHi plays a role in the proliferative response to IL 2. Monitoring pHi with an intracellularly trapped, pH-sensitive, fluorescent dye, 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein, we demonstrated that IL 2 rapidly (less than 90 s) initiates an increase in pHi in IL 2-sensitive human and murine T cells. Because intracellular alkalinization requires extracellular Na+ and is amiloride-sensitive, it likely occurs through activation of the Na+/H+ antiport. Using partitioning of a weak acid, 5,5-dimethyl-2,4-oxazolidinedione, we confirmed that the IL 2-dependent increase in pHi is sustained for several hours and returns to near base-line levels by 18 h. We also investigated the consequence of preventing Na+/H+ exchange on the proliferative response induced by IL 2. IL 2-driven proliferation occurred in nominally bicarbonate-free medium in the presence of concentrations of amiloride analogs sufficient to inhibit the Na+/H+ antiport and prevent intracellular alkalinization. These data suggest that although the antiport is activated by binding of IL 2 to its receptor, intracellular alkalinization is not essential for IL 2-dependent proliferation. It seems unlikely that either cytoplasmic alkalinization or activation of the Na+/H+ antiport are triggers for T cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W94763087,"The purpose of this study is to clarify the involvement of protein kinase C in pulmonary surfactant secretion from adult rat alveolar type II cells in primary culture. Surfactant secretion in vitro is stimulated by at least two classes of compounds. One class, (e.g. terbutaline) increases intracellular cyclic AMP, whereas the other class (e.g. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA] does not. TPA has been shown to activate protein kinase C in other cell systems. In our studies, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), which is a direct activator of protein kinase C, stimulated [3H] phosphatidylcholine secretion by alveolar type II cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Tetracaine, which is an inhibitor of protein kinase C, inhibited the TPA-induced secretion of [3H]phosphatidylcholine from alveolar type II cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, tetracaine had no effect on terbutaline-induced secretion. The effects of terbutaline and OAG upon surfactant secretion were significantly more than additive, but those of TPA and OAG were less than additive. The specific activity of protein kinase C was 6-fold higher than cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase found in type II cells when both kinases were assayed using lysine-rich histone as a common phosphate acceptor. Ninety-four per cent of protein kinase C activity was recovered in the cytosolic fraction of unstimulated type II cells, and 40% of activity in cytosolic fraction was translocated to particulate fraction upon treatment with TPA. As observed in other tissues, protein kinase C of alveolar type II cells was highly activated by 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol or TPA in the presence of Ca2+ and phosphatidylserine. These results suggest that pulmonary surfactant secretion in vitro is stimulated by both protein kinase C and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1582914326,"The receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) in the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A-431 is a glycoprotein of apparent molecular weight = 170,000. During biosynthesis, the receptor is first detected as a precursor of apparent Mr = 160,000. In this report we describe our studies on the structures of the oligosaccharide moieties of the mature receptor and its precursor. A-431 cells were grown in medium containing radioactive sugars and the radiolabeled receptors were purified by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radiolabeled glycopeptides were prepared from the purified receptor by proteolysis, and their structures were examined by a variety of techniques. The mature EGF receptor contains both complex-type and high mannose-type Asn-linked oligosaccharides in the approximate ratio of 2 to 1, while the precursor contains only high mannose-type chains. A number of experimental results demonstrate that the mature receptor does not contain oligosaccharides in O-linkage through N-acetylgalactosamine to either serine or threonine. The high mannose-type oligosaccharides in both precursor and mature receptor can be cleaved by endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and occur in the mature receptor as Man9GlcNAc2 (6%), Man8GlcNAc2 (49%), Man7GlcNAc2 (25%), and Man6GlcNAc2 (20%), whereas, in the receptor precursor the high mannose chains occur primarily as Man8GlcNAc2 (70%). The complex-type oligosaccharides in the mature receptor are predominantly tri- or tetraantennary species and are unusual in several respects. (i) Many of the chains do not contain sialic acid, while the remaining chains contain 1-2 sialic acid residues. (ii) Half of the [3H] mannose-derived radioactivity was recovered as [3H] fucose and the remaining half as [3H] mannose, indicating that there may be an average of 3 fucose residues/chain. (iii) About one-third of the [3H] glucosamine-derived radioactivity in these glycopeptides was recovered as N-acetylgalactosamine and these residues are all alpha-linked and occur at the nonreducing termini. These data demonstrate that the complex-type Asn-linked oligosaccharides in the EGF receptor from A-431 cells contain sugar residues related to human blood type A. In light of other recent studies, these results suggest that in A-431 cells blood group determinants in surface glycoproteins are contained in Asn-linked but not O-linked oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1578651746,"Serological studies indicate that HLA-B17 molecules are unusually cross-reactive with products of the HLA-A locus. In particular, a mouse monoclonal antibody MA2.1 defines an epitope that is shared by HLA-A2 and the two subtypes (Bw57 and Bw58) of B17. To investigate these relationships at the structural level, we have isolated a gene coding for Bw58 from the WT49 B cell line. The gene was transfected into mouse L cells and its protein product was characterized with a panel of monoclonal anti-HLA antibodies. The nucleotide sequence of 3520 base pairs of DNA encompassing the seven exons coding for Bw58 and associated introns was determined. The deduced protein sequences for Bw58 and eight other HLA-A,B,C molecules were compared. In the first polymorphic domain (alpha 1), Bw58 is unusual in that it is as homologous to HLA-A locus products as to HLA-B locus products. In the second polymorphic domain (alpha 2), Bw58 has greater homology to B locus products. In the alpha 1 domain of Bw58, small segments of amino acid and nucleotide sequence homology with A2 (residues 62-65) and with Aw24 (residues 75-83) are found in the major region of polymorphic diversity (residues 62-83). These similarities provide structural correlates for the serological relationships between Bw58 and A locus molecules, with residues 62-65 possibly being involved in the MA2.1 epitope. From comparisons of four HLA-A and four HLA-B sequences, there is a difference in the patterns of variation for A and B locus molecules. For B locus molecules there is greater variation in the alpha 1 domain than in the alpha 2 domain. For A locus molecules, variation in the two domains is similar and like that for B locus alpha 2 domains. In comparison to other HLA-A,B,C genes, novel inverted repeat sequences were found in the nucleotide sequence of HLA-Bw58. These sequences flank the putative RNA splicing sites at the 3' end of the exons encoding the alpha 2 and alpha 3 protein domains."
https://openalex.org/W1581503263,"Thyroid hormone has been shown to rapidly stimulate the rate of rat growth hormone gene transcription which parallels the kinetics of binding of 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (L-T3) to its nuclear receptor (Yaffe, B. M., and Samuels, H. H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 6284-6291). We have constructed a chimeric gene to explore whether the 5'-flanking region of the rat growth hormone gene contains a DNA element which could mediate thyroid hormone control of growth hormone gene expression. The construct consists of 1.8 kilobase pairs of the 5'-flanking region extending 11 nucleotides downstream from the transcription initiation (cap) site ligated to Escherichia coli DNA containing the structural gene for the enzyme xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. GC cells, a growth hormone producing rat pituitary cell line, were transfected with this chimeric gene and stable transformants in which the enzyme is regulated by L-T3 were isolated by positive selection using mycophenolic acid and xanthine. These stable transformants develop with relatively high frequency and show marked L-T3 stimulation of xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase mRNA which is initiated at the cap site of the growth hormone gene. This study provides the first evidence that the 5'-flanking region of the rat growth hormone gene contains a DNA regulatory element which can mediate control of gene expression by thyroid hormone."
https://openalex.org/W131107118,"We have expression-cloned in Escherichia coli the major polyoma virus capsid protein, VP1. Under the inducible control of the hybrid tac promoter, VP1 constituted between 2 and 3% of the total host cell protein. The expressed VP1 was purified to near homogeneity with initial yields to 10%. Optimal expression was temperature-dependent, and significant intracellular degradation could be demonstrated. The final product was obtained as one predominant isoelectric focusing species, without the pattern of post-translational modification seen in virus-infected eukaryotic cells. The purified VP1 from E. coli will be useful as a substrate for the purification of VP1 modification enzymes and in the study of inter-VP1 oligomerization."
https://openalex.org/W1552909757,"A phosphoprotein phosphatase that dephosphorylates smooth muscle myosin has been purified to apparent homogeneity from turkey gizzards. Smooth muscle phosphatase (SMP) IV has a molecular weight of 150,000 as determined by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-200 column and is composed of two subunits (Mr = 58,000 and 40,000). Although it is active toward a number of proteins, its activities toward the contractile proteins, intact myosin, heavy meromyosin, and isolated myosin light chains are higher than its activities toward phosphorylase alpha, histone IIA, and phosphorylase kinase. SMP-IV preferentially dephosphorylates the beta-subunit of phosphorylase kinase. The properties of the enzyme have been studied using heavy meromyosin, a soluble chymotryptic fragment of myosin, and isolated myosin light chains as substrates. SMP-IV has high affinity for both substrates and is optimally active at neutral pH. Divalent cations, Ca2+ and Mg2+, activate the dephosphorylation of heavy meromyosin but inhibit the activity toward myosin light chains. Low concentrations of ATP (1-5 mM) activate SMP-IV but concentrations higher than 5 mM are inhibitory. Inhibition of 50% of the activity of the enzyme by NaF and PPi requires concentrations higher than 10 mM. Rabbit skeletal muscle heat stable inhibitor-2 has no effect on the activity of SMP-IV toward heavy meromyosin, myosin light chains, and phosphorylase alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1486852747,"The enzyme CDP-diglyceride synthetase (CTP: phosphatidate cytidylyltransferase; EC 2.7.7.41) has been purified to 90% homogeneity from Escherichia coli cells that overproduce the enzyme 50-fold through the use of recombinant DNA technology. The purification required the use of different detergents at each step, illustrating the refractory hydrophobic nature of this protein. Apparent physical effects of EDTA on the enzyme were also utilized in the purification. The enzyme has an apparent minimum subunit mass of 27,000 daltons, as estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The amino acid composition of the protein was determined, and it correlates well with the theoretical protein product of the cds gene, the sequence of which is reported in the accompanying paper (Icho, T., Sparrow, C. P., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 12078-12083). The pure enzyme displays surface dilution kinetics when assayed in the presence of Triton X-100. As previously suggested on the basis of studies using partially purified preparations, the enzyme mechanism is sequential, and computer-calculated kinetic constants are reported herein. The substrate specificity of the enzyme is also investigated. This is the first time this enzyme has been purified to homogeneity from any source, despite the fact that it is essential for phospholipid biosynthesis in all organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1507235852,"Three hours after isolation, cultured hepatocytes have approximately 150,000 surface vasopressin receptors/cell, and these exhibit a Kd for 125I-vasopressin of 6 nM based on calculation of Koff/Kon, or a Kd of 9.5 nM based on Scatchard plot analysis. After the binding of 125I-vasopressin to its receptor on the hepatocyte surface, this complex is internalized with a t1/2 of 3-6 min. Following this internalization, the number of vasopressin receptors on the cell surface is restored both in vitro and in the isolated perfused liver with a t1/2 of 8-10 min. This restoration is blocked in vitro by incubation of the hepatocytes at 18 degrees C, but not by cycloheximide, suggesting that internalized vasopressin receptors recycle back to the cell surface. Prolonged incubation of hepatocytes with vasopressin results in the loss of greater than 75% of the vasopressin surface binding at concentrations of vasopressin approximately equivalent to its Kd. The binding of vasopressin to cultured hepatocytes 3-5 h after isolation resembles binding to the isolated perfused whole liver with respect to receptor dynamics. During culture for 48 h, however, we observe a progressive loss of hepatocyte surface vasopressin receptors. Concomitant with this reduction in surface receptors with time in culture, there appears to be a marked elevation in intracellular receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1497008230,"Friend virus transformed murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells are known to take up heme from the surrounding medium and to incorporate it into newly synthesized hemoglobin (Granick, J. L., and Sassa, S. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 5402-5406), but the mechanism of its uptake is unknown. We hypothesized the existence of a specific receptor for heme in the plasma membrane. Using [55Fe]heme, we examined the characteristics of its interaction with MEL cells at 4 degrees C. [55Fe]heme binding reached equilibrium within 4 h, was 80% dissociable by 16 h, and was independent of pH over the range 7.0-8.2. Specific heme binding was linear with cell number, and competitive binding studies with various heme analogues, such as free protoporphyrin IX, metal-substituted protoporphyrin IX, Fe-mesoporphyrin IX, and Fe-deuteroporphyrin IX, revealed significant stereospecificity for Fe-protoporphyrin IX. The dissociation constant of the interaction was 0.03 nM-1 with no evidence of cooperativity or multiple classes of sites. The average number of sites/cell was approximately 10,300. Reduction of binding following preincubation with trypsin, in conjunction with the above data, suggests that this cell type may display a receptor for heme which is comprised, as least in part, of protein."
https://openalex.org/W1518491715,"A soluble ATP-dependent system for protein degradation has been demonstrated in reticulocyte lysates, but not in extracts of nucleated cells. We report that extracts of undifferentiated murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells contain a labile ATP-stimulated proteolytic system. The addition of ATP to MEL cell extracts at alkaline pH enhances degradation of endogenous cell proteins and various radiolabeled exogenous polypeptides from 2-15-fold. Nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs had no effect. In reticulocytes, one role of ATP in proteolysis is for ubiquitin conjugation to protein substrates. MEL cells also contain ubiquitin and extracts can conjugate 125I-ubiquitin to cell proteins; however, this process in MEL cells seems unrelated to protein breakdown. After removal of ubiquitin from these extracts by DEAE- or gel chromatography, the stimulation of proteolysis by ATP was maintained and readdition of purified ubiquitin had no further effect. In addition, these extracts degraded in an ATP-dependent fashion casein whose amino groups were blocked and could not be conjugated to ubiquitin. After gel filtration or DEAE-chromatography of the MEL cell extracts (unlike those from reticulocytes), we isolated a high molecular weight (600,000) ATP-dependent proteolytic activity, which exhibits many of the properties of energy-dependent proteolysis seen in crude cell extracts. For example, both the protease and crude extracts are inhibited by hemin and N-ethylmaleimide and both hydrolyze casein, globin, and lysozyme rapidly and denatured albumin relatively slowly. The protease, like the crude extracts, is also stimulated by UTP, CTP, and GTP, although not as effectively as ATP. Also, nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs and pyrophosphate do not stimulate the protease. Thus, some mammalian cells contain a cytosolic proteolytic pathway that appears independent of ubiquitin and involves and ATP-dependent protease, probably similar to that found in Escherichia coli or mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1504757391,"The chemoreceptor for aspartate in Salmonella typhimurium was purified from an Escherichia coli strain containing a plasmid bearing the receptor's structural gene (tar). The receptor was solubilized from salt-washed membranes with the nonionic detergent octyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside and purified by a combination of ion exchange, molecular sieve and hydroxyapatite-agarose chromatography. The inclusion of glycerol and 1,10-phenanthroline in all buffers used prior to ion exchange chromatography prevented scission of the receptor by an endogenous proteolytic activity. The solubilized receptor was estimated to have a molecular weight of 248,000 from its behavior on Sephacryl S-300, suggesting that the receptor may be organized as a multimer containing 4 +/- 1 identical subunits. Circular dichroic measurements of the purified protein indicate that 78% of its residues are arranged in helical secondary structures."

We have cloned these genes onto plasmids that overproduce Arc and Mnt to greater than 1% of the soluble cellular protein. Both proteins were purified to greater than 95% homogeneity, and N-terminal sequences and amino acid compositions were determined. These data, in combination with previously determined gene sequences, establish the complete protein sequences for Arc (53 residues) and Mnt (82 residues). Both proteins have melting temperatures between 45 and 55 degrees C and can be renatured to a fully active species. Arc is a dimer in solution and Mnt is a tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1481765783,"Ubiquitin is a highly conserved, 76-amino acid polypeptide recently demonstrated to be involved in ATP-dependent protein degradation in mammalian cells. From immunoblot analyses with anti-human-ubiquitin antibodies we have detected the presence of free ubiquitin in green leaves, etiolated shoots, and dry seeds of the higher plant, oats (Avena sativa L.). We also find that crude oat extracts contain protease(s) that rapidly degrade both oat and human ubiquitin (t1/2 approximately 10 min at 27 degrees C). This proteolysis apparently cleaves ubiquitin at the carboxyl-terminal glycine dipeptide and results in inactivation of the molecule with respect to ligation but does not affect its mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Using homogenization conditions that preclude this proteolysis (low pH and the addition of the protease inhibitor p-chloromercuribenzoate) and immunoblotting as an assay for the protein, a procedure for the purification of ubiquitin from etiolated oat shoots was developed. Characterization of purified oat ubiquitin by absorption spectra, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, radioimmunoassay with anti-human-ubiquitin antibodies, and kinetic analyses using the ubiquitin activating enzyme isolated from rabbit liver indicates that this protein is remarkably similar to the mammalian form. Small differences between the oat and human proteins have been observed by amino acid compositional analyses indicating that the two forms are not totally homologous. Immunoblotting of crude oat extracts has revealed the presence of high molecular weight proteins recognized by anti-ubiquitin antibodies that represent ubiquitin-protein conjugates formed in vivo. Taken together, these data provide evidence that higher plants contain a ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway that is mechanistically identical to that present in animals."
https://openalex.org/W1492364002,"Abstract The yeast 2-micron circle plasmid encodes a protein, FLP, that mediates site-specific recombination across the two FLP-binding sites of the plasmid. We have used a novel technique, exonuclease-treated substrate analysis, to determine the minimal duplex DNA sequence needed for this recombination event. A linear DNA containing two FLP sites in a direct orientation was treated with the double-strand specific 3'-exonuclease, exonuclease III, to generate molecules with a nested set of single-strand deletions that extended into one of the FLP sites. The DNA was then end-labeled at the sites of the deletions and used as a substrate for recombination in vitro. FLP-mediated recombination between two FLP sites excised a restriction endonuclease cleavage site from the DNA. Comparison of the fragments produced by restriction enzyme digestion of untreated and FLP-treated DNA showed to the nucleotide the duplex DNA sequence required for FLP-mediated recombination. To examine essential sequences in the opposite DNA strand, similar experiments were done using the 5'-exonuclease encoded by phage T7. The minimal essential duplex DNA sequence lies within the region of the FLP site that was previously shown to be protected from nuclease digestion in the presence of FLP. A modified form of this technique can be used to study the minimal sequence requirements of site-specific DNA binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1560558716,"Two proteolytic fragments generated during the preparation of the aspartate receptor from Salmonella typhimurium have been purified. These fragments are the products of a single cleavage by an endogenous protease after amino acid 259 in the sequence of the intact receptor. Proteolytic fragment 1 (PF1) represents amino acids 1-259 (Mr = 29,000); this unit retains the aspartate-binding function of the intact receptor. The second fragment (PF2) includes residues 260-552 (Mr = 31,000) and has the normal sites of reversible methylation for the receptor. Like the purified intact receptor, this fragment can be methylated in vitro, although at a much slower rate. Circular dichroic measurements suggest that both proteolytic fragments contain substantial alpha-helical structure, approximately 95 and 53% for PF1 and PF2, respectively. No beta-structure could be detected in either fragment. Molecular sieve chromatography in the presence of detergent suggests that PF1 occurs as a stable multimer of an order equivalent to that observed for the detergent-solubilized aspartate receptor, i.e. a tetramer (+/- 1). PF2 is found to have a multimeric form which is sensitive to the removal of detergent. It is proposed that these fragments represent structural and functional domains of the aspartate receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1517500075,"Most laboratory strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain many copies of an autonomously replicating plasmid called 2-micron circle DNA. This plasmid codes for a site-specific recombinase, the FLP protein which promotes recombination across two 599-base pair inverted repeats of the plasmid DNA. We have cloned the FLP gene under the control of a strong Escherichia coli promoter and have hyperproduced the protein in that organism. Cell-free extracts from this source promote highly efficient site-specific recombination in vitro and we have used this activity to purify the FLP protein substantially. The enzyme acts efficiently on circular and linear substrates and requires only monovalent or divalent cations for activity."
https://openalex.org/W1525485438,"The bacteriophage T4 primase, composed of the T4 proteins 41 and 61, synthesizes pentaribonucleotides used to prime DNA synthesis on single-stranded DNA in vitro. 41 protein is also a DNA helicase that opens DNA in the same direction as the growing replication fork. Previously, Mattson et al. (Mattson, T., Van Houwe, G., Bolle, A., Selzer, G., and Epstein, R. (1977) Mol. Gen. Genet. 154, 319-326) located part of gene 41 on a 3400-base pair EcoRI fragment of T4 DNA (map units 24.3 to 21.15). In this paper, we report the cloning of T4 DNA representing map units 24.3 to 20.06 in a multicopy plasmid vector. Extracts of cells containing this plasmid complement gene 41- extracts in a DNA synthesis assay, indicating that this region contains all the information necessary for the expression of active 41 protein. We located gene 41 more precisely between T4 map units 22.01 to 20.06 since our cloning of this region downstream of the strong lambda promoter PL results in the production of active 41 protein at a level 100-fold greater than after T4 infection. We have purified 133 mg of homogeneous 41 protein from 27 g of these cells. Like the 41 protein from T4 infected cells, the purified 41 protein in conjunction with the T4 gene 61 priming protein catalyzes primer formation (assayed by RNA primer-dependent DNA synthesis with T4 polymerase, the genes 44/62 and 45 polymerase accessory proteins, and the gene 32 helix-destabilizing protein) and is a helicase whose activity is stimulated by T4 61 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1553605076,"Previous work from this laboratory had demonstrated that CDP-diglyceride hydrolase of Escherichia coli is encoded by the cdh gene that maps near minute 88 (Bulawa, C. E., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 11257-11264). We now report the construction of hybrid plasmids and the sequencing of a 1,243-base pair insert carrying cdh. The further construction of BAL31 deletions of this insert, in conjunction with maxicell experiments and in vitro enzyme assay, has led to the identification of a 756-base pair coding sequence for the cdh polypeptide. The molecular weight of the primary translation product deduced from the DNA sequence of the cdh gene is 28,450, in agreement with maxicell experiments. Parallel purification of the enzyme from extracts of wild-type and overproducing strains confirms the presence of a 27-kDa polypeptide in the overproducer, as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the most purified fractions. Inspection of the DNA sequence reveals a very hydrophobic N-terminal domain that may be either a signal peptide or a special region, anchoring the hydrolase to the membrane. In contrast to the CDP-diglyceride synthetase, the overall amino acid composition of the CDP-diglyceride hydrolase is not extraordinarily hydrophobic. Although both CDP-diglyceride synthetase and CDP-diglyceride hydrolase can transfer the CMP moiety of CDP-diglyceride to a suitable acceptor, the primary structures and mechanisms of action of these two enzymes are very different."
https://openalex.org/W1644277640,"Mouse L-929 fibroblasts, an established line of cells, are very sensitive to lysis by human lymphotoxin (hTNF-beta). Specific binding of a highly purified preparation of hTNF-beta to these cells was examined. Recombinant DNA-derived hTNF-beta was radiolabeled with [3H]propionyl succinimidate at the lysine residues of the molecule to a specific activity of 200 microCi/nmol of protein. [3H]hTNF-beta was purified by high performance gel permeation chromatography and the major fraction was found to be monomeric by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The labeled hTNF-beta was fully active in causing lysis of L-929 fibroblasts and bound specifically to high affinity binding sites on these cells. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed the presence of a single class of high affinity receptors with an apparent Kd of 6.7 X 10(-11) M and a capacity of 3200 binding sites/cell. Unlabeled recombinant DNA-derived hTNF-beta was found to be approximately 5-fold more effective competitive inhibitor of binding than the natural hTNF-beta. The binding of hTNF-beta to these mouse fibroblasts was also correlated with the ultimate cell lysis. Neutralizing polyclonal antibodies to hTNF-beta efficiently inhibited the binding of [3H]hTNF-beta to the cells. We conclude that the specific high affinity binding site is the receptor for hTNF-beta and may be involved in lysis of cells."
https://openalex.org/W1858599486,"Incubation of intact Sendai virions or reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes with phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes at 37 degrees C results in virus-liposome fusion. Neither the liposome nor the virus content was released from the fusion product, indicating a nonleaky fusion process. Only liposomes possessing virus receptors, namely sialoglycolipids or sialoglycoproteins, became leaky upon interaction with Sendai virions. Fusion between the virus envelopes and phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes was absolutely dependent upon the presence of intact and active hemagglutinin/neuraminidase and fusion viral envelope glycoproteins. Fusion between Sendai virus envelopes and phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes lacking virus receptors was evident from the following results. Anti-Sendai virus antibody precipitated radiolabeled liposomes only after they had been incubated with fusogenic Sendai virions. Incubation of N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole-labeled fusogenic reconstituted Sendai virus particles with phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes resulted in fluorescence dequenching. Incubation of Tb3+-containing virus envelopes with phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol liposomes loaded with sodium dipicolinate resulted in the formation of the chelation complex Tb3+-dipicolinic acid, as was evident from fluorescence studies. Virus envelopes fuse efficiently also with neuraminidase/Pronase-treated erythrocyte membranes, i.e. virus receptor-depleted erythrocyte membranes, although fusion occurred only under hypotonic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1488427520,"The synthesis and maturation of the precursor forms of three mitochondrial enzymes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis have been studied in vivo. Primary cultures of bovine adrenocortical cells were radiolabeled with [35S] methionine and newly synthesized cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 (P-450scc), 11 beta-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450 (P-450(11)beta), and adrenodoxin immunoisolated using specific antibodies. Both the precursor and mature forms of P-450scc and P-450(11)beta were detected during short periods of pulse labeling; however, the precursor forms were transitory in nature while their corresponding mature forms accumulated. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the precursor form of each cytochrome P-450 had an apparent half-life of 3.5 min. In contrast, the precursor form of adrenodoxin was not readily detected in pulse-labeling experiments until a substantial amount of its mature form had accumulated. When the cultured cells were treated with a chelator of divalent cations (o-phenanthroline) or a mitochondrial uncoupler (dinitrophenol), the maturation of all three precursors was inhibited. The synthesis of the P-450scc and P-450(11)beta precursors was induced in cells maintained in the presence of adrenocorticotropin, and the rates of appearance of their processed forms were also increased. The mature forms of all three proteins were immunoisolated from a trypsinized mitochondrial fraction prepared from the radiolabeled cells, demonstrating that the mature proteins were localized within the organelle. These studies establish that the maturation of the precursor forms of the mitochondrial steroidogenic enzymes are characterized by steps similar to those reported for other mitochondrial precursor proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1499828469,"In outer medullary kidney tubules, both specific mineralocorticoid, and specific glucocorticoid Na+/K+-ATPase activation in vitro were inhibitable by amiloride, an inhibitor of a number of Na+-transporting mechanisms (Bentley, P.J. (1968) J. Physiol. (Lond.) 195, 317-330; Kinsella, J. L., and Aronson, P. S. (1980) Am. J. Physiol. 238, F461-F469). In addition, dexamethasone raised, whereas amiloride reduced, intracellular Na+ levels. These observations are consistent with the possibility that the steroidal responses are mediated by changes in intracellular Na+ ion activity. However, when intracellular Na+ levels were increased by the incubation of tubule segments in medium containing ouabain (10(-4) M), no Na+/K+-ATPase activation was observed, over incubation periods of up to 6 h. As mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid effects are maximal within 2 h (Rayson, B.M., and Lowther, S.O. (1984) Am. J. Physiol. 246, F656-F662), these results suggest that the Na+ ion per se does not mediate the steroidal effects observed, directly. Incubation of tubule segments in medium containing 10(-4) M ouabain, at 37 degrees C, for longer periods (18 h), however, did indeed increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity, markedly. Thus, a potential homeostatic mechanism was demonstrable, where a chronic increase in intracellular Na+ level, measured after 2-4 h of treatment, resulted in an increase in Na+/K+-ATPase activity, such that the intracellular Na+ level was restored after 18-20 h of incubation to one not significantly different from the control value. This mechanism, however, appears to be clearly distinguishable from that which mediates steroidal Na+/K+-ATPase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2155292329,"Adenosine 5-phosphosulfate (APS) kinase from Penicillium chrysogenum is irreversibly inactivated by trinitrobenzene sulfonate in a pseudo-first order process. Under standard assay conditions kapp was 1.9 X 10(-3) s-1. Saturating MgATP or MgADP decreased Kapp to a limit of 4.1 X 10(-4) s-1. There are several explanations for the partial protection, including the presence of two essential lysyl side chains, only one of which is at the active site. Analysis of the inactivation kinetics by means of linear plots derived for partial protection yielded dissociation constants for E X MgATP (Kia) and E X MgADP (Kiq) of 2.9 mM and 1.8 mM, respectively. Low concentrations of APS alone provided no protection against trinitrobenzene sulfonate inactivation, but in the presence of 1 mM MgADP, as little as 2 microM APS provided additional protection while 100 microM APS reduced kapp to the limit of 4.1 X 10(-4) s-1. The results confirm the formation of a dead end E X MgADP X APS proposed earlier as the cause of the potent substrate inhibition by APS. Linear plots of 1/delta k versus 1/[MgADP] at different fixed [APS] and of 1/delta k versus 1/[APS] at different fixed [MgADP] were characteristic of the ordered binding of MgADP before APS (or the highly synergistic random binding of the two ligands). The true APS dissociation constant of the dead end E X MgADP X APS complex (K'ib) was determined to be 1.9 microM. From the value of K'ib and the previously reported value of KIB (apparent inhibition constant of APS as a substrate inhibitor of the catalytic reaction at saturating MgATP), the ratio of the MgADP and PAPS release rate constants (k4/k3) was calculated to be 11. Inactivation kinetics was used to study the effects of Mg2+ and high salt on ADP and APS binding. The results indicated that free ADP binds to the enzyme more tightly than does MgADP at low ionic strength. High salt decreased free ADP binding, but had little effect on MgADP binding. APS binds more tightly to E X MgADP in the absence or presence of salt than to E X ADP."
https://openalex.org/W1535564119,"A cDNA library of Tangier liver mRNA has been established, and two apo-A-I-containing clones were identified. The complete derived amino acid sequence of preproapo-A-I has been established by nucleic acid sequence analysis of cloned apo-A-I cDNA and specific primer extensions on Tangier liver RNA. Sequence analysis of the longest cDNA clone, pMDB136T, established the derived amino acid sequence of residues 116-243 of plasma apo-A-I. The remaining portion of the sequence of Tangier preproapo-A-I mRNA was established by sequence analysis of specific primer extensions of synthetic oligonucleotides on Tangier liver mRNA. This latter technique provided the derived amino acid sequence of residues -24 to 116, thus completing the entire preproapo-A-I structure. The structure of Tangier preproapo-A-I was identical to normal preproapo-A-I except for a single base substitution (G----T) which resulted in the isosteric replacement of a glutamic acid residue at position 120 to aspartic acid. These results are interpreted as indicating that there is no major structural defect in Tangier apo-A-I, and the rapid rate of catabolism of apo-A-I in Tangier disease is due to a post-translational defect in apo-A-I metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2915245647,"In vitro, a bacteriophage T4 primase composed of T4 61 and 41 proteins, catalyzes the formation of pentaribonucleotides used to initiate DNA synthesis on single-stranded DNA. We have determined that cells containing a plasmid with the T4 DNA from 18.68 to 15.05 map units express an activity that substitutes for authentic 61 protein in vitro in catalyzing primer-dependent DNA synthesis with six other T4 DNA replication proteins. This result establishes that this region, genetically assigned to gene 61, is the structural gene for the priming protein. Cells containing a plasmid with gene 61 downstream of the strong phage lambda promoter PL and the antitermination site nutL produce 100-fold more 61 protein than T4-infected cells. We have developed an improved purification procedure which yields 100 mg of homogeneous, active protein from 178 g of these cells. In the plasmid, the T4 DNA downstream of gene 61 expresses a protein of 30,000 daltons. This protein may be the T4 DNA adenine methylase (dam) gene product, since Schlagman and Hattman (Schlagman, S. L. and Hattman, S. (1983) Gene 22, 139-156) have shown that this activity is expressed by plasmids containing T4 DNA from this region. In the PL, nutL vector, the expression of both the 30,000-dalton and 61 proteins is enhanced up to 20-fold by the presence of the phage lambda N protein, a transcription antitermination protein, suggesting that expression of the T4 DNA in the plasmid may be regulated transcriptionally. In addition, in both N+ and N- cells, the level of 61 protein, whose gene is proximal to PL on the plasmid, is lower than that of the product of the promoter distal 30,000-dalton protein gene. This result suggests that, at least in the plasmid construction, the expression of 61 protein may also be regulated after transcription."
https://openalex.org/W306094050,"Alterations in the functional capacity of pancreatic beta cells appear to contribute to coxsackievirus B4-induced, long-term hyperglycemia in mice. Mice infected with prototype B4 or its diabetogenic E2 variant were monitored for abnormalities in sugar metabolism (by the glucose tolerance test), for total protein and insulin synthesis in intact beta cells, for alterations in beta cell proteins, and for virus replication. The infected mice were hypoglycemic at 72 h postinfection and hyperglycemic at 6 weeks. At 8 weeks postinfection, few of the prototype- but most of the E2-infected mice remained hyperglycemic. Total protein and synthesis of immunoprecipitable insulin decreased during early infection. At 8 weeks postinfection, insulin synthesis in the prototype-infected mice increased almost to the level of control mice. Although insulin synthesis increased likewise in the E2-infected mice, it remained well below the control level. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed the disappearance of many cellular proteins in beta cells from E2-infected mice but of very few in cells from prototype-infected mice at 72 h postinfection. Many of the disappearing proteins reappeared gradually in the E2-infected group. Infectious virus was recovered from the infected beta cells only at 72 h postinfection. Functional impairment in these cells appears to be a factor in virus-induced hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2417275310,DNA fragments containing either one or both of the 72-base pair (bp) elements which constitute the SV40 enhancer and the three adjacent 21-bp repeats were associated with histone octomers from chicken erythrocytes in vitro. Both fragments formed complexes with electrophoretic mobilities of nucleosomes containing the appropriate length of DNA. Analysis of DNase I cutting of uniquely end-labeled complexes suggests that the fragment containing a single 72-bp element forms a positioned core particle. Control experiments show that positioning is not due to the 21-bp repeats or to end effects. The fragment with a tandem repeat of the 72-bp element also does not associate randomly with histones. The data are consistent with formation of a core particle on one or the other of the repeated enhancer sequences. We discuss possible functional consequences of such nucleosome positioning.
https://openalex.org/W1566592886,"Abstract Lysyl-tRNA synthetase, dissociated from the multienzyme complexes of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases from rat liver, was previously found to be 6-fold more active than the synthetase complex in the enzymatic synthesis of P1,P4-bis(5'-adenosyl)tetraphosphate. The bi-substrate and product inhibition kinetics of the reaction are analyzed. Free lysyl-tRNA synthetase exhibits distinctly different kinetic patterns from those of an 18 S synthetase complex containing lysyl-tRNA synthetase. The 18 S synthetase complex shows kinetic patterns which are consistent with an ordered Bi Uni Uni Bi ping-pong mechanism. Free lysyl-tRNA synthetase shows kinetic patterns consistent with a random mechanism. The differences in the enzymatic properties are attributed to the organization of the supramolecular structure of the synthetase complex. The results suggest that association of the synthetases may affect the mechanisms of the synthesis of AppppA."
https://openalex.org/W1602189664,"Abstract New multisubstrate-type inhibitors of the deoxynucleoside kinases have been synthesized, tested for their specificity as soluble inhibitors of enzymes from Lactobacillus acidophilus, and used to construct media for affinity chromatography. Each inhibitor was a deoxynucleoside 5'-adenosine 5'-P1,P4-tetraphosphate (abbreviated dNp4A, where dN represents a dAdo, dCyd, dGuo, or dThd moiety linked through its 5'-hydroxyl to the terminal phosphate of adenosine tetraphosphate). At micromolar concentrations, each inhibitor strongly and specifically inhibited the corresponding deoxynucleoside kinase. Each of the four Lactobacillus deoxynucleoside kinase activities was selectively retained on its homologous dNp4A-Sepharose affinity medium. The activity was eluted on addition of the respective dNp4A with up to 70% recovery and 300-500-fold purification (relative to an ammonium sulfate fraction). Whereas dThd kinase was retained only by the dTp4A column, a portion of the dAdo kinase activity was retained, along with all the dCyd kinase or dGuo kinase, on dCp4A- or dGp4A-Sepharose, respectively, and coeluted with these activities. Conversely, all three activities were quantitatively retained on dAp4A-Sepharose, without competition from either dCyd or dGuo, and were eluted simultaneously upon addition of dAp4A. These observations further confirm the understanding that this organism employs paired, and presumably bifunctional, kinases, namely dCyd/dAdo kinase and dGuo/dAdo kinase, along with a separate thymidine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1521809407,"Until now it had been assumed that mammalian skin contains only one provitamin D, 7-dehydrocholesterol, that is eventually converted to vitamin D3 after the skin is exposed to sunlight. Examination by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography of lipid extracts from young rat skin, however, led to the observation that 7-dehydrocholesterol is not the only provitamin D in rat skin. Another provitamin D, accounting for 22 +/- 3% of the total provitamin content of the skin, was resolved from 7-dehydrocholesterol, and, on the basis of ultraviolet spectrophotometry, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry, was identified as 24-dehydroprovitamin D3 (cholesta-5,7,24-trien-3 beta-ol). This new cutaneous provitamin D is not unique to the rat because it was also detected in the skin of reptiles, amphibians, birds, aquatic mammals, and humans. To be certain that the cutaneous 24-dehydroprovitamin D3 was as susceptible as 7-dehydrocholesterol to ultraviolet photolysis, rat skin was exposed to ultraviolet radiation. A reverse phase high performance liquid chromatographic analysis of a lipid extract of rat skin previously exposed to ultraviolet radiation demonstrated the presence of both previtamin D3 and 24-dehydroprevitamin D3. Therefore, these observations demonstrate for the first time that mammalian skin has the capacity to produce not one but at least two different vitamin Ds."
https://openalex.org/W1496582212,"Atractyloside inhibited gluconeogenesis from dihydroxyacetone in hepatocytes from fasted rats and increased lactate synthesis. In the presence of atractyloside, lactate/pyruvate and beta-hydroxybutyrate/aceto-acetate ratios were increased and the accumulation of Fru-2,6-P2 was prevented. In the absence of atractyloside, gluconeogenesis from dihydroxyacetone was stimulated by dibutyryl-cAMP and, to a much lesser extent, by norepinephrine and vasopressin. Omission of Ca2+ increased the stimulation by norepinephrine but prevented that by vasopressin. High concentrations (greater than or equal to 40 microM) of atractyloside abolished the stimulation of gluconeogenesis by dibutyryl-cAMP but not that by norepinephrine or vasopressin. Exogenous Ca2+ was not required for hormonal stimulation in the presence of atractyloside. The stimulation by norepinephrine was inhibited by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N-tetraacetic acid or prazosin but not by propranolol. Atractyloside caused decreases of all glycolytic intermediates and an activation of pyruvate kinase. Norepinephrine partially reversed these effects. The mitochondrial and cytosolic ATP/ADP ratios were determined by digitonin fractionation of hepatocytes. Norepinephrine or vasopressin increased the cytosolic ATP/ADP in the presence of atractyloside. We suggest that the increased availability of cytosolic ATP could be responsible for the stimulation of gluconeogenesis by these hormones."

The denatured form of this 18.5-kilodalton polypeptide, isolated on a preparative polyacrylamide gel run in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, has been used as an antigen to direct the production of rabbit anti-helicase III antibodies. The antibodies obtained fail to inhibit directly either the helicase activity or the DNA-dependent adenosine nucleoside 5'-triphosphatase activity of helicase III. However, when the antigen-antibody complex is removed from solution by binding to Staphylococcus aureus cells with subsequent sedimentation, there is excellent correlation between the loss of both enzymatic activities and the loss of the helicase III polypeptide. The anti-helicase III antibodies have been used as a reagent to probe immunologically a library of E. coli DNA fragments inserted into the plasmid pBR322 for expression of the helicase III antigen. The gene encoding helicase III has been localized on a 2.0-kilobase pair PvuII-EcoRI fragment. Bacterial cells harboring a multicopy plasmid containing this fragment overproduce the helicase III antigen approximately 100-fold."
