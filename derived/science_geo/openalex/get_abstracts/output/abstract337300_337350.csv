https://openalex.org/W1974476190,"Biodiversity studies comprise the systematic examination of the full array of different kinds of organisms together with the technology by which the diversity can be maintained and used for the benefit of humanity. Current basic research at the species level focuses on the process of species formation, the standing levels of species numbers in various higher taxonomic categories, and the phenomena of hyperdiversity and extinction proneness. The major practical concern is the massive extinction rate now caused by human activity, which threatens losses in the esthetic quality of the world, in economic opportunity, and in vital ecosystem services."

Scattering walls used in this experiment included human breast tissue, chicken breast tissue, and a water suspension of polystyrene particles with scattering coefficients up to 21.7. Submillimeter resolution was achieved for two-dimensional ballistic images of a single point, a double-point fluorescence source, and a bar test chart in or behind these different turbid media."

https://openalex.org/W2028701737,"Two modified forms of carbon were quenched by a rapid-cooling technique from graphite sheets shock-compressed to 65 gigapascals and 3700 K. One form, ""n-diamond,"" which was obtained from the most rapidly cooled part, has a crystal structure close to that of cubic diamond. The other form, found in the relatively slow-cooled part, was comparable to an i-carbon prepared by an ion-beam technique. The n-diamond is interpreted as a metastable form, the same as hexagonal diamond, converted from graphite through a martensitic transition, for which either the region or the path may be different from that of hexagonal diamond. The second form was found to be produced through reconstruction."

This ""cold welding"" is remarkable both for the low loads required and for the fact that it occurs under ambient laboratory conditions, conditions in which the gold surfaces are covered with films of weakly adsorbed organic impurities. These impurities are probably displaced laterally during the welding. Welding can be prevented by the presence of a self-assembled gold(I) alkylthiolate monolayer on the gold surfaces. The welded contacts have low electrical resistivity and can be made thin enough to transmit light. This system is a promising one with which to study interaction between interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2029540169,Cold oceanic water upwells along the western coastline of most major continents. The thermal front that demarcates the farthest seaward extent of this upwelled water is sometimes characterized by extensive whisps or cross-frontal filaments. These may play an important role in the functioning of the upwelling ecosystem as a whole. Satellite observations on filaments of the Benguela upwelling system show filaments that exceed 1000 kilometers in length. Two mechanisms that may produce the exceptional length of these filaments are interaction with Agulhas rings and the effect of intense berg winds.

https://openalex.org/W2009195153,"High-level nuclear wastes (HLW) is defined as a high concentration of radioactive elements that will remain dangerous for a length of time - up to a few million years - if released to the biosphere. The question can high-level nuclear wastes be disposed? remains unanswered. Congress has designated Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the place for long-term storage of wastes that originate from fuel rods discarded from nuclear reactors or from the liquid waste produced when fuel rods are dissolved. Currently the State of Nevada is suing the Department of Energy (DOE) to stop any activity at Yucca Mountain, and DOE is suing Nevada for its obstruction tactics. It is predicted that it will be at least 2010 before any HLW will be put underground. The question is then raised if perhaps the US is pushing too hard to begin storing HLW underground. In Europe, no imminent storage is anticipated, and it is pointed out that current storage under water near surface leaves waste available if a use for it occurs, and also continued storage renders the waste easier to handle. Public opinion remains the final obstacle to underground storage of HLW."
