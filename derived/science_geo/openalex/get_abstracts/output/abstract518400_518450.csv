To understand whether experience also modifies the connectivity of new neurons, we systematically investigated changes in their innervation following environmental enrichment (EE). We found that EE exposure between 2–6 weeks following neuron birth, rather than merely increasing the number of new neurons, profoundly affected their pattern of monosynaptic inputs. Both local innervation by interneurons and to even greater degree long-distance innervation by cortical neurons were markedly enhanced. Furthermore, following EE, new neurons received inputs from CA3 and CA1 inhibitory neurons that were rarely observed under control conditions. While EE-induced changes in inhibitory innervation were largely transient, cortical innervation remained increased after returning animals to control conditions. Our findings demonstrate an unprecedented experience-dependent reorganization of connections impinging onto adult-born neurons, which is likely to have important impact on their contribution to hippocampal information processing.

Newly generated neurons in the adult dentate gyrus (DG) contribute uniquely to hippocampal information processing (Marín-Burgin et al., 2012Marín-Burgin A. Mongiat L.A. Pardi M.B. Schinder A.F.

It is believed that the unique functional contribution of these neurons depends on their heightened electrical excitability facilitating neuronal spiking in response to excitatory input (Mongiat et al., 2009Mongiat L.A.

While early (N-methyl-D-aspartate) (NMDA) receptor activation is important for the survival of adult-generated neurons (Tashiro et al., 2006Tashiro A. Sandler V.M. Toni N. Zhao C. Gage F.H. NMDA-receptor-mediated, cell-specific integration of new neurons in adult dentate gyrus.Nature. 2006; 442: 929-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), increased excitability favors the preferential recruitment of new neurons into active hippocampal memory circuits (Kee et al., 2007Kee N.

Neurosci. 2012; 32: 8696-8702Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), underscoring the importance of the critical period for the functional integration of adult-generated neurons in the DG. Very little is known about how the connectivity pattern of adult-generated neurons develops during their own ontogeny and how this is modified by experience, particularly during the critical period. Indeed, it is very likely that the state of connectivity is of similar importance for the functional contribution of adult-generated neurons to network activity as are their well-known characteristic cell-intrinsic properties of heightened excitability and synaptic plasticity. In the DG, a temporal sequence of presynaptic innervation onto adult-generated neurons, at first by local interneurons, then followed later by subcortical and finally cortical projection neurons, results in a stepwise integration into the pre-existing network (Deshpande et al., 2013Deshpande A.

Commun. 2012; 3: 1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). An intriguing aspect of this integration process is that the extent of neurons added to the network can be modulated by experiences such as exposure to an enriched environment (EE) and voluntary exercise (Kempermann et al., 1997Kempermann G.

While merely increasing the number of newly added neurons may improve hippocampal information processing capacity and thereby exert beneficial effects on cognition and affective disorders (Aimone et al., 2011Aimone J.B.

Sahay A. Hen R. Neurogenesis and generalization: a new approach to stratify and treat anxiety disorders.Nat. Neurosci. 2012; 15: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), it has remained entirely elusive whether experience also affects the establishment of new neurons’ connectivity. Here, by taking advantage of a previously validated rabies virus (RABV)-based monosynaptic tracing technique (Wickersham et al., 2007Wickersham I.R. Lyon D.C. Barnard R.J. Mori T. Finke S. Conzelmann K.K. Young J.A. Callaway E.M.

After having confirmed that neuronal activity does not directly affect the transsynaptic spread of RABV (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Figure S1 available online) (Ugolini, 2011Ugolini G. Rabies virus as a transneuronal tracer of neuronal connections.Adv.

Monosynaptic inputs to new neurons in the dentate gyrus.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), we exposed adult mice to a 4-week-long period of EE (Figure S2A) and examined the resulting alterations in the spectrum of presynaptic inputs impinging onto adult-generated DG granule neurons. To this end, a GFP-encoding, EnvA-pseudotyped ΔG RABV (Wickersham et al., 2007Wickersham I.R. Lyon D.C. Barnard R.J. Mori T. Finke S. Conzelmann K.K. Young J.A. Callaway E.M. Monosynaptic restriction of transsynaptic tracing from single, genetically targeted neurons.Neuron. 2007; 53: 639-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) was delivered to the DG of adult mice at different times following infection with a G-TVA retrovirus encoding (1) the EnvA receptor (TVA) for restricting primary RABV infection to newborn neurons as “starter” population and (2) the RABV glycoprotein (G), which is necessary for subsequent monosynaptic transfer (via transcomplementation) to their first-order presynaptic partners (Figure 1A). As EE may have distinct effects on new neurons’ survival (Tashiro et al., 2007Tashiro A. Makino H. Gage F.H. Experience-specific functional modification of the dentate gyrus through adult neurogenesis: a critical period during an immature stage.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 3252-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and synaptic integration according to their stage of maturation, we designed an experimental protocol of exposing neurons to EE at different times following their birth (Figure 1B): during their first 3 weeks of life (EE 3 weeks), between weeks 2 and 6 after their birth (EE 6 weeks), and between weeks 9 and 13 (EE 13 weeks). Starter cells were transduced with RABV 1 week prior to sacrifice and sections analyzed for reporter double-positive (DsRed+/GFP+) starter neurons (Figure S2B) and GFP-only positive first-order presynaptic partner neurons (Figure 1C). Based on their anatomical localization, morphology, and marker expression (Deshpande et al., 2013Deshpande A. Bergami M. Ghanem A. Conzelmann K.K. Lepier A. Götz M. Berninger B. Retrograde monosynaptic tracing reveals the temporal evolution of inputs onto new neurons in the adult dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E1152-E1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the type of GFP-only positive presynaptic neurons within the DG were identified as glutamatergic hilar mossy cells or distinct types of GABAergic interneurons distributed between the hilus (e.g., HIPP cells), the subgranular zone (SGZ)/granule cell layer (GCL) (e.g., basket cells and hilar commissural-associational pathway-related cells [HICAP] cells) and the molecular layer (ML; e.g., MOPP and axo-axonic cells) (Figure 2A). We also observed occasional labeling of mature granule neurons, which, however, declined with increasing intervals between retrovirus and RABV infection, suggesting that this labeling is due to pseudotransduction of mature granule neurons as argued previously (Deshpande et al., 2013Deshpande A. Bergami M. Ghanem A. Conzelmann K.K. Lepier A. Götz M. Berninger B. Retrograde monosynaptic tracing reveals the temporal evolution of inputs onto new neurons in the adult dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E1152-E1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). EE exposure starting 1 week before and continuing for the entire first 3 weeks following new neurons’ birth (EE 3 weeks) did not produce overt changes in their local connectivity as revealed by RABV tracing in comparison to nonenriched animals (Figures 1C and 2B). Likewise, the number of labeled presynaptic cells was similar for control and EE-exposed mice following EE 13 weeks (Figures 1C and 2B). In contrast, a significantly higher proportion (about 2-fold) of all classes of presynaptic local interneurons was detected, when EE was provided between the second and sixth week of the neurons’ life (Figures 1C and 2B). These changes were mirrored by a sharp increase in the amount of GFP+ axonal fibers within the DG, which profusely innervated the SGZ, GCL, and inner portions of the ML (Figure 2C). Most of these axon terminals originated from the aforementioned local interneurons; however, part of the axon collaterals invaded the DG from adjacent hippocampal structures. Intriguingly, following EE 6 weeks, a considerable amount of GFP+ presynaptic neurons was found within the CA1 and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus (Figures 3A and 3B ), projecting to the DG. These neurons were distributed throughout the CA hippocampal subfields, yet with the exception of occasional CA3 pyramidal cells (Vivar et al., 2012Vivar C. Potter M.C. Choi J. Lee J.Y. Stringer T.P. Callaway E.M. Gage F.H. Suh H. van Praag H. Monosynaptic inputs to new neurons in the dentate gyrus.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) (Figure S3A), their position, marker expression, and morphology were characteristic of interneurons (Freund and Buzsáki, 1996Freund T.F. Buzsáki G. Interneurons of the hippocampus.Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 347-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures 3C and S3B–S3E). The majority of the GFP+ neurons and their smooth dendritic arbors were located in stratum oriens, often bordering with the alveus (Figures 3B and 3C). The remaining of the labeled interneurons was found in the strata lacunosum moleculare, radiatum, and lucidum/pyramidale (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3B–S3D). While some classes of interneurons have been previously described to directly project to the DG by crossing the hippocampal fissure (Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008Klausberger T. Somogyi P. Neuronal diversity and temporal dynamics: the unity of hippocampal circuit operations.Science. 2008; 321: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar, Sik et al., 1994Sik A. Ylinen A. Penttonen M. Buzsáki G. Inhibitory CA1-CA3-hilar region feedback in the hippocampus.Science. 1994; 265: 1722-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), these neurons were only sporadically labeled in nonenriched animals or following EE 3 weeks and 13 weeks (at about 6- to 13-fold lower frequency in controls compared with EE 6 weeks; Figure 3D). Of note, a conspicuous number of GFP+ projection neurons were also found in the subiculum (Deshpande et al., 2013Deshpande A. Bergami M. Ghanem A. Conzelmann K.K. Lepier A. Götz M. Berninger B. Retrograde monosynaptic tracing reveals the temporal evolution of inputs onto new neurons in the adult dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E1152-E1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Figure S3D). Intriguingly, voluntary exercise between weeks 2 and 6 (Run 6 weeks) alone, while known to enhance neurogenesis similar to EE (van Praag et al., 1999van Praag H. Kempermann G. Gage F.H. Running increases cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the adult mouse dentate gyrus.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (3069) Google Scholar), elicited only a modest change in inputs arising from hippocampal interneurons (Figures 2B, 3B, and 3D), suggesting for a specific effect of EE on local innervation and cross-regional inhibitory feedback onto newborn neurons during a defined period of synaptic integration. Next, we examined the innervation by long-range projection neurons of subcortical and cortical origins previously shown to impinge onto adult-born hippocampal neurons (Deshpande et al., 2013Deshpande A. Bergami M. Ghanem A. Conzelmann K.K. Lepier A. Götz M. Berninger B. Retrograde monosynaptic tracing reveals the temporal evolution of inputs onto new neurons in the adult dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E1152-E1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, Vivar et al., 2012Vivar C. Potter M.C. Choi J. Lee J.Y. Stringer T.P. Callaway E.M. Gage F.H. Suh H. van Praag H. Monosynaptic inputs to new neurons in the dentate gyrus.Nat. Commun. 2012; 3: 1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). With the exception of neurons located in the mammillary bodies (Mamm), whose small proportion remained overall stable between all the experimental paradigms, the number of labeled cholinergic neurons located in the medial septum/nucleus of diagonal band of Broca (Ms/Ndb) and in particular that of projection neurons within the lateral EC steadily increased over time in nonenriched animals (Figure 4A). Strikingly, however, following both EE 6 weeks and Run 6 weeks, but not upon EE 3 weeks and 13 weeks, the number of GFP+ neurons dramatically increased in Ms/Ndb and EC (Figures 4A, 4B, S4A, and S4B). These data show that like local inputs, long-range projections are selectively increased in number following exposure to EE during a specific time window, but also provide evidence for differential regulation of local and long-range connection in response to running. In order to subject the finding that EE can modify the extent of cortical innervation to an independent experimental test, we measured the density of mushroom spines in newly generated DG neurons at 6 and 13 weeks after their generation (EE 6 weeks and 13 weeks). EE 6 weeks produced a 2- to 3-fold increase in overall mushroom spine density compared with control conditions (Figures 4C and 4D), irrespective of the position along the dendritic shaft and the location of the neuron along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus (Figures 4E–4G). These data show that 4 weeks of EE can induce structural rearrangements in the dendritic innervation of adult-born neurons, thus independently corroborating the increase in EC innervation observed by RABV tracing. In contrast, EE 13 weeks did not elicit any significant changes in mushroom spine density compared with controls (Figures 4C and 4D), again arguing in favor of a restricted period of enhanced structural plasticity in new neurons between weeks 2 and 6 after their generation. Overall, during a specific period, EE produced significant changes in the presynaptic connectivity of new neurons comprising a 1.8- ± 0.3-fold increase in local inputs, a 4.1- ± 0.8-fold increase in hippocampal inputs, and a 4.1- ± 0.7-fold increase in long-range cortical and subcortical inputs (Figure 4H). Intriguingly, patch-clamp recordings from hippocampal slices of control and EE 6-week-exposed animals revealed a reduction in the ratio between excitation and inhibition as evidenced by the frequency of spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents (Figures S4E–S4G), which indicates additional layers of regulation by EE 6 weeks on the synaptic level. Finally, we asked the question to which extent the enhancement of local and long-range connectivity induced by EE 6 weeks remained stable following the return of animals to control housing conditions for additional 7 weeks (EE 13 weeks—return; Figure 1B). Notably, the pattern of innervation of newborn neurons by hippocampal interneurons (both of local origin or arising from interneurons in the CA subfields) was virtually indistinguishable from controls of the same age, suggesting that the changes in intrahippocampal connectivity required active maintenance and became reversed following environmental impoverishment (Figures 2B and 3D). In sharp contrast, the increase in cortical innervation as well as mushroom spine density induced during EE 6 weeks remained stable even after returning mice to standard cages (Figures 4A–4D). These data indicate that some changes in connectivity, presumably via pruning mechanisms, can still occur after the end of the critical period, yet innervation from the EC, once established, appears to be robust against experience-dependent changes after closure of the critical window. In this study we provide evidence for an experience-dependent reorganization of the presynaptic connectivity of adult-generated DG granule neurons, as evidenced by quantitative and qualitative alterations in the labeling of presynaptic partners using a RABV-based tracing technique. Several lines of control experiments (Figure S1) corroborate that the alterations in tracing were not due to activity-dependent changes in RABV biosynthesis and transsynaptic spread itself. Thus, the data presented here provide evidence for true structural plasticity and demonstrate that important changes in network connectivity can occur within a specific time window during the maturation of newly generated neurons (2–6 weeks of age; Figure 1B). This time window coincides with the well-known critical period of enhanced synaptic plasticity previously described (Ge et al., 2007Ge S. Yang C.H. Hsu K.S. Ming G.L. Song H. A critical period for enhanced synaptic plasticity in newly generated neurons of the adult brain.Neuron. 2007; 54: 559-566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, Kheirbek et al., 2012bKheirbek M.A. Tannenholz L. Hen R. NR2B-dependent plasticity of adult-born granule cells is necessary for context discrimination.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 8696-8702Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), suggesting that synaptic plasticity mechanisms may contribute to the establishment and stabilization of the presynaptic innervation pattern (Chancey et al., 2013Chancey J.H. Adlaf E.W. Sapp M.C. Pugh P.C. Wadiche J.I. Overstreet-Wadiche L.S. GABA depolarization is required for experience-dependent synapse unsilencing in adult-born neurons.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 6614-6622Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). While the increase in local and long-range connectivity was restricted to a critical time window of 2–6 weeks following neuron birth, intrahippocampal connections appeared to be still capable of undergoing refinement, as evidenced by the decline in most of the local connectivity upon returning the animals from EE to control conditions, indicating some degree of plasticity still beyond the critical period. Of note, in controls, connections arising from interneurons in the stratum pyramidale and stratum lucidum had increased by 13 weeks to a similar level as reached following EE 6 weeks, suggesting that exposure to EE may have accelerated the establishment of this source of inhibitory input. It is tempting to speculate that the dynamic turnover of inhibitory synaptic contacts onto new neurons contributes to shaping the window of the critical period and thus sculpting the final connectivity of adult-generated neurons. In contrast to local innervation, the tracing of cortical inputs remained unaffected by the return to standard housing, arguing for a more stable nature of these connections once they have been established. This stability may reflect the establishment of specific information channels by mapping specific EC inputs onto particular newborn granule neurons during the critical period as hypothesized previously (Bergami and Berninger, 2012Bergami M. Berninger B. A fight for survival: the challenges faced by a newborn neuron integrating in the adult hippocampus.Dev. Neurobiol. 2012; 72: 1016-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Besides revealing canonical connections onto adult-generated neurons, RABV tracing of EE-exposed mice also disclosed a previously unknown source of input arising from interneurons of the CA3 and CA1 subfields. This set of connections was virtually undetectable under control conditions, suggesting that during basal levels of network activity, they may exert little regulatory influence on the activity of adult-generated neurons, but became manifest following EE 6 weeks, embedding adult-generated neurons into a novel feedback inhibitory circuitry. Given that EE represents a more physiological condition than standard housing, this feedback inhibitory circuit may be functionally important in facilitating the sparse activation of newborn neurons by cortical inputs (hence favoring pattern separation) and modulating the way spatial information is conveyed to the downstream CA3 region (Aimone et al., 2011Aimone J.B.

Neuronal diversity and temporal dynamics: the unity of hippocampal circuit operations.Science. 2008; 321: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the fact that these inhibitory connections appear mostly transient in nature might suggest that they play a specific role in the regulation of excitatory cortical inputs during activity-dependent synaptic refinement. Our findings also demonstrate the existence of a more complex effect of EE and voluntary exercise than the previously described mere increase in newborn neuron numbers, which has been correlated with the amelioration of cognitive abilities and anxiety- and depression-related behaviors (van Praag et al., 2000van Praag H.

In fact, while genetic manipulations aimed at increasing adult neurogenesis are sufficient to improve pattern separation, they only reproduce the behavioral response of antidepressants when coupled to voluntary exercise (Sahay et al., 2011Sahay A. Scobie K.N. Hill A.S. O’Carroll C.M. Kheirbek M.A. Burghardt N.S. Fenton A.A. Dranovsky A. Hen R. Increasing adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve pattern separation.Nature. 2011; 472: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). One may therefore hypothesize that some of the anxiolytic effects produced by exercise and EE, rather than depending on the simple addition of more neurons, require a functional reorganization of the synaptic circuitry during newborn neurons’ incorporation. Of note, exercise and EE differentially affected presynaptic connectivity of newborn neurons. For instance, while cortical innervation was increased similar to EE following voluntary running (Figure 4A), local and hippocampal connectivity were only slightly modified (Figures 2B and 3D). These differences in circuit remodeling reveal paradigm-specific effects on the connectivity of newborn neurons well in line with the differential behavioral consequences observed after EE and running (Clemenson et al., 2014Clemenson G.D. Lee S.W. Deng W. Barrera V.R. Iwamoto K.S. Fanselow M.S. Gage F.H. Enrichment rescues contextual discrimination deficit associated with immediate shock.Hippocampus. 2014; (Published online October 31, 2014)https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.22380Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the overall excitation/inhibition balance of synaptic inputs in EE-exposed new neurons (6-week paradigm) was decreased compared with control neurons (Figures S4E–S4G), hinting at a dissociation of spine density and frequency of excitatory synaptic input. This may reflect additional, potentially homeostatic, changes in the quality of synaptic transmission, such as reduced release probability at excitatory synapses (given the lack of changes in synaptic current amplitude and the apparent increase in the number of synaptic connections as revealed by monosynaptic tracing). These changes in excitation/inhibition balance may result in a reduced activation of neurons exposed to EE, which suggests an accelerated acquisition of more mature functional properties (Marín-Burgin et al., 2012Marín-Burgin A. Mongiat L.A. Pardi M.B. Schinder A.F. Unique processing during a period of high excitation/inhibition balance in adult-born neurons.Science. 2012; 335: 1238-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In conclusion, understanding the functional implications of the experience-dependent remodeling of presynaptic connectivity described here may provide fundamental new insights into the unique contribution of adult-born neurons to information processing and how environmental factors can result in the emergence of individual differences in brain plasticity and emotional behavior (Freund et al., 2013Freund J. Brandmaier A.M. Lewejohann L. Kirste I. Kritzler M. Krüger A. Sachser N. Lindenberger U. Kempermann G.

Eight- to 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice were housed in groups of three to four. Housing conditions included nesting and bedding material, standard pellet food, and water provided ad libitum, 12 hr light and dark cycle, temperature of 21°C–22°C and cage replacement once per week. EE was provided for 4 consecutive weeks by housing mice in larger cages (about 100 × 50 cm) equipped with paper tunnels, colored plastic tunnels and other toys, nesting material, and running wheels. For surgery, mice were anesthetized via an intraperitoneal injection of midazolam (5 mg per kg of body weight), medetomidine (0.5 mg per kg), and fentanyl (0.05 mg per kg) and placed in a stereotactic apparatus. A small craniotomy was performed, and ∼0.5 μl of retrovirus or ∼0.2 μl RABV was slowly injected in the dorsal DG (relative to Bregma: caudal 2.0, lateral 1.6, and ventral 1.8–2.0) during a time window of 10–20 min, by using a finely pulled capillary connected to a pulse generator (WPI). After infusion, the capillary was left in place for additional 10 min to allow complete diffusion of the virus. The skin incision was closed carefully after retroviral injection to minimize inflammation and in order to facilitate the subsequent RABV injection. After surgery, anesthesia was antagonized with an intraperitoneal injection of atipamezol (2.5 mg per kg), flumazenil (0.5 mg per kg), and naloxone (1.2 mg per kg). Animals were allowed to recover, and physical conditions were monitored daily to improve their welfare before euthanizing them. All animal procedures were performed in agreement with the European Union and German guidelines and were approved by the Government of State of Upper Bavaria. The retroviral constructs used in this study were derived from a Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus-based retroviral vector in which gene expression is driven by the chicken beta-actin promoter (van Praag et al., 2002van Praag H.

The retrovirus encoding for DsRedExpress2, the RABV glycoprotein (G) and the TVA800 (the GPI anchored form of the TVA receptor), designed as CAG-DsRedExpress2-2A-G-IRES2-TVA (i.e., G-TVA retrovirus), was described previously (Deshpande et al., 2013Deshpande A.

Retroviral plasmid was used to transfect the helper-free HEK293 gpg cell line using Lipofectamine 2000T, and virus was harvested at 2, 4, and 6 days after transfection, followed by ultracentrifugation. Titers used for experiments were typically in the range of 5 − 9 × 107. Construction of the G gene-deleted GFP-expressing RABV (SADΔG-GFP) has been described before (Wickersham et al., 2007Wickersham I.R. Lyon D.C. Barnard R.J. Mori T. Finke S. Conzelmann K.K. Young J.A.

Samples were imaged with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 710, Zeiss) equipped with four laser lines (405, 488, 561, and 633 nm) and 10× (NA 0.3), 25× (NA 0.8), 40× (NA 1.1), or 63× (NA 1.3) objectives. In alternative, a TCS SP8 Leica confocal system equipped with a white light laser was used. Quantifications were performed by counting the number of double-transduced (GFP+ and DsRed+) and RABV-only transduced cells (GFP+) per mouse (or culture). The number of RABV-only transduced cells was normalized on double-transduced cells to take into account for changes in the number of starter neurons. For quantification of mushroom spine density in labeled adult-born neurons, dendritic segments in the outer- and inner-medial ML of the septal and temporal hippocampal poles were randomly acquired at 80× or 100×, using an interstack interval of 0.3 μm. Images were subsequently processed by deconvolution (Huygens Pro, Scientific Volume Imaging). Upon image calibration, ImageJ was used to manually quantify linear spine density and to estimate the individual cross-sectional area of relatively large spines (mushroom spines were classified having an area ≥0.4 μm2) (Zhao et al., 2006Zhao C.

Methods A total of 131 frail, elderly women over 75 years were randomly assigned to one of four groups: exercise and MFGM supplementation (Ex+MFGM), exercise and placebo (Ex+Plac), MFGM supplementation, or the placebo group. The exercise group attended a 60-minute training program twice a week for three months, and the MFGM group ingested 1g of the MFGM supplement in pill form, daily for 3 months. The primary outcome measure was change in frailty status based on Fried’s frailty phenotype. Secondary outcome measures included body composition, physical function and hematological parameters, and interview survey components assessing lifestyle factors. Participants were followed for 4 months post-intervention. Results Significant group×time interactions were observed for usual walking speed (P = 0.005), timed up & go (P<0.001), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 / insulin-like growth factor 1 ratio (P = 0.013). The frailty components revealed that weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, and slow walking speed were reversed, but low muscle strength did not significantly changed. Frailty reversal rate was significantly higher in the Ex+MFGM (57.6%) than in the MFGM (28.1%) or placebo (30.3%) groups at post-intervention (χ2 = 8.827, P = 0.032), and at the follow-up was also significantly greater in the Ex+MFGM (45.5%) and Ex+Plac (39.4%) groups compared with the placebo (15.2%) group (χ2 = 8.607, P = 0.035). The exercise+MFGM group had the highest odds ratio (OR) for frailty reversal at post-intervention and follow-up (OR = 3.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13–8.60; and OR = 4.67, 95% CI = 1.45–15.08, respectively). Conclusion This study suggests that interventions including exercise and nutrition can improve frailty status. Statistically significant additive effects of MFGM with exercise could not be confirmed in this population, and further investigation in larger samples is necessary.

Here we performed a large-scale mass spectrometry-based analysis of the lipid composition of three brain regions as well as kidney and skeletal muscle of humans, chimpanzees, rhesus macaques, and mice. The human brain shows the most distinct lipid composition: 76% of 5,713 lipid compounds examined in our study are either enriched or depleted in the human brain. Concentration levels of lipids enriched in the brain evolve approximately four times faster among primates compared with lipids characteristic of non-neural tissues and show further acceleration of change in human neocortical regions but not in the cerebellum. Human-specific concentration changes are supported by human-specific expression changes for corresponding enzymes. These results provide the first insights into the role of lipids in human brain evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1999294081,"The mucin 1 (MUC1) oncoprotein has been linked to the inflammatory response by promoting cytokine-mediated activation of the NF-κB pathway. The TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is an essential effector of proinflammatory NF-κB signaling that also regulates cancer cell survival. The present studies demonstrate that the MUC1-C transmembrane subunit induces TAK1 expression in colon cancer cells. MUC1 also induces TAK1 in a MUC1+/−/IL-10−/− mouse model of colitis and colon tumorigenesis. We show that MUC1-C promotes NF-κB-mediated activation of TAK1 transcription and, in a positive regulatory loop, MUC1-C contributes to TAK1-induced NF-κB signaling. In this way, MUC1-C binds directly to TAK1 and confers the association of TAK1 with TRAF6, which is necessary for TAK1-mediated activation of NF-κB. Targeting MUC1-C thus suppresses the TAK1→NF-κB pathway, downregulates BCL-XL and in turn sensitizes colon cancer cells to MEK inhibition. Analysis of colon cancer databases further indicates that MUC1, TAK1 and TRAF6 are upregulated in tumors associated with decreased survival and that MUC1-C-induced gene expression patterns predict poor outcomes in patients. These results support a model in which MUC1-C-induced TAK1→NF-κB signaling contributes to intestinal inflammation and colon cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2016580965,"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) play important roles in angiogenesis and tumor growth. Tanshinone IIA (T2A) is a novel antiangiogenic agent with promising antitumor effects; however, the molecular mechanism underlying the antiangiogenic effects of T2A remains unclear. In the present study, we provided evidence showing that T2A inhibited angiogenesis and breast cancer growth by down-regulating VEGF expression. Specifically, T2A repressed HIF-1α expression at the translational level and inhibited the transcriptional activity of HIF-1α, which led to the down-regulation of VEGF expression. Suppression of HIF-1α synthesis by T2A correlated with strong dephosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its effectors ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), a pathway regulating HIF-1α expression at the translational level. In addition, we also found that T2A inhibited the angiogenesis and growth of human breast cancer xenografts in nude mice through suppression of HIF-1α and VEGF. Our study provides novel perspectives and potential targets for the treatment of human breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2329067927,"The median survival time of breast cancer patients with brain metastasis is less than 6 months, and even a small metastatic lesion often causes severe neurological disabilities. Because of the location of metastatic lesions, a surgical approach is limited and most chemotherapeutic drugs are ineffective owing to the blood brain barrier (BBB). Despite this clinical importance, the molecular basis of the brain metastasis is poorly understood. In this study, we have isolated RNA from samples obtained from primary breast tumors and also from brain metastatic lesions followed by microRNA profiling analysis. Our results revealed that the miR-509 is highly expressed in the primary tumors, whereas the expression of this microRNA is significantly decreased in the brain metastatic lesions. MicroRNA target prediction and the analysis of cytokine array for the cells ectopically expressed with miR-509 demonstrated that this microRNA was capable of modulating the two genes essential for brain invasion, RhoC and TNF-α that affect the invasion of cancer cells and permeability of BBB, respectively. Importantly, high levels of TNF-α and RhoC-induced MMP9 were significantly correlated with brain metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, the results of our in vivo experiments indicate that miR-509 significantly suppressed the ability of cancer cells to metastasize to the brain. These findings suggest that miR-509 has a critical role in brain metastasis of breast cancer by modulating the RhoC-TNF-α network and that this miR-509 axis may represent a potential therapeutic target or serve as a prognostic tool for brain metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2093699603,"In this study, we investigated changes in resting state networks (RSNs) in patients with gliomas located in the left hemisphere and its relation to cognitive function. We hypothesized that long distance connection, especially between hemispheres, would be affected by the presence of the tumor. We further hypothesized that these changes would correlate with, or reflect cognitive changes observed in patients with gliomas. Resting state functional MRI datasets from 12 patients and 12 healthy controls were used in the analysis. The tumor’s effect on three well-known RSNs including the default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), and salience network (SN) identified using independent component analysis were investigated using dual regression analysis. Scores of neuropsychometric testing (WAIS-III and WMS-R) were also compared. Compared to the healthy control group, the patient group showed significant decrease in functional connectivity in the right angular gyrus/inferior parietal lobe of the ventral DMN and in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of the left ECN, whereas a significant increase in connectivity in the right ECN was observed in the right parietal lobe. Changes in connectivity in the right ECN correlated with spatial memory, while that on the left ECN correlated with attention. Connectivity changes in the ventral DMN correlated with attention, working memory, full IQ, and verbal IQ measures. Although the tumors were localized in the left side of the brain, changes in connectivity were observed in the contralateral side. Moreover, these changes correlated with some aspects of cognitive function indicating that patients with gliomas may undergo cognitive changes even in the absence of or before the onset of major symptoms. Evaluation of resting state networks could be helpful in advancing our hodological understanding of brain function in glioma cases."
https://openalex.org/W1995846850,"An inverted pH gradient across the cell membranes is a typical feature of malignant cancer cells that are characterized by extracellular acidosis and cytosol alkalization. These dysregulations are able to create a unique milieu that favors tumor progression, metastasis and chemo/immune-resistance traits of solid tumors. A key event mediating tumor cell pH alterations is an aberrant activation of ion channels and proton pumps such as (H+)-vacuolar-ATPase (V-ATPase). TM9SF4 is a poorly characterized transmembrane protein that we have recently shown to be related to cannibal behavior of metastatic melanoma cells. Here, we demonstrate that TM9SF4 represents a novel V-ATPase-associated protein involved in V-ATPase activation. We have observed in HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer cell lines that TM9SF4 interacts with the ATP6V1H subunit of the V-ATPase V1 sector. Suppression of TM9SF4 with small interfering RNAs strongly reduces assembly of V-ATPase V0/V1 sectors, thus reversing tumor pH gradient with a decrease of cytosolic pH, alkalization of intracellular vesicles and a reduction of extracellular acidity. Such effects are associated with a significant inhibition of the invasive behavior of colon cancer cells and with an increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of 5-fluorouracil. Our study shows for the first time the important role of TM9SF4 in the aberrant constitutive activation of the V-ATPase, and the development of a malignant phenotype, supporting the potential use of TM9SF4 as a target for future anticancer therapies."

https://openalex.org/W1994830230,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promotes cancer cell invasion, metastasis and treatment failure. EMT may be activated in cancer cells by reactive oxygen species (ROS). EMT may promote conversion of a subset of cancer cells from a CD44(low)-CD24(high) (CD44L) epithelial phenotype to a CD44(high)-CD24(-/low) (CD44H) mesenchymal phenotype, the latter associated with increased malignant properties of cancer cells. ROS are required for cells undergoing EMT, although excessive ROS may induce cell death or senescence; however, little is known as to how cellular antioxidant capabilities may be regulated during EMT. Mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) is frequently overexpressed in oral and esophageal cancers. Here, we investigate mechanisms of SOD2 transcriptional regulation in EMT, as well as the functional role of this antioxidant in EMT. Using well-characterized genetically engineered oral and esophageal human epithelial cell lines coupled with RNA interference and flow cytometric approaches, we find that transforming growth factor (TGF)-β stimulates EMT, resulting in conversion of CD44L to CD44H cells, the latter of which display SOD2 upregulation. SOD2 induction in transformed keratinocytes was concurrent with suppression of TGF-β-mediated induction of both ROS and senescence. SOD2 gene expression appeared to be transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB and ZEB2, but not ZEB1. Moreover, SOD2-mediated antioxidant activity may restrict conversion of CD44L cells to CD44H cells at the early stages of EMT. These data provide novel mechanistic insights into the dynamic expression of SOD2 during EMT. In addition, we delineate a functional role for SOD2 in EMT via the influence of this antioxidant upon distinct CD44L and CD44H subsets of cancer cells that have been implicated in oral and esophageal tumor biology."

https://openalex.org/W2060102282,"Monomeric α-synuclein (αSN) species are abundant in nerve terminals where they are hypothesized to play a physiological role related to synaptic vesicle turn-over. In Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy body (DLB), αSN accumulates as aggregated soluble oligomers in terminals, axons and the somatodendritic compartment and insoluble filaments in Lewy inclusions and Lewy neurites. The autosomal dominant heritability associated to mutations in the αSN gene suggest a gain of function associated to aggregated αSN. We have conducted a proteomic screen to identify the αSN interactome in brain synaptosomes. Porcine brain synaptosomes were fractionated, solubilized in non-denaturing detergent and subjected to co-immunoprecipitation using purified recombinant human αSN monomers or oligomers as bait. The isolated αSN binding proteins were identified with LC-LTQ-orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry and quantified by peak area using Windows client application, Skyline Targeted Proteomic Environment. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD001462. To quantify the preferential binding an average fold increase was calculated by comparing binding to monomer and oligomer. We identified 10 proteins preferentially binding monomer, and 76 binding preferentially to oligomer and a group of 92 proteins not displaying any preferred conformation of αSN. The proteomic data were validated by immunoprecipitation in both human and porcine brain extracts using antibodies against monomer αSN interactors: Abl interactor 1, and myelin proteolipid protein, and oligomer interactors: glutamate decarboxylase 2, synapsin 1, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and VAMP-2.

https://openalex.org/W2034030812,"Elevated levels of the inducible heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp72) have been implicated in mammary tumorigenesis in histological investigations of human breast cancer. We therefore examined the role of Hsp72 in mice, using animals in which the hsp70 gene was inactivated. We used a spontaneous tumor system with mice expressing the polyomavirus middle T (PyMT) oncogene under control of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long-terminal repeat (MMT mice). These mice developed spontaneous, metastatic mammary cancer. We then showed Hsp72 to be upregulated in a fraction of mammary cancer initiating cells (CIC) within the MMT tumor cell population. These cells were characterized by elevated surface levels of stem cell markers CD44 and Sca1 and by rapid metastasis. Inactivation of the hsp70 gene delayed the initiation of mammary tumors. This delay in tumor initiation imposed by loss of hsp70 was correlated with a decreased pool of CIC. Interestingly, hsp70 knockout significantly reduced invasion and metastasis by mammary tumor cells and implicated its product Hsp72 in cell migration and formation of secondary neoplasms. Impaired tumorigenesis and metastasis in hsp70-knockout MMT mice was associated with downregulation of the met gene and reduced activition of the oncogenic c-Met protein. These experiments therefore showed Hsp72 to be involved in the growth and progression of mammary carcinoma and highlighted this protein as a potential target for anticancer drug development."

In this study we present a novel approach to rapidly and efficiently down regulate pluripotency genes during initiation of differentiation to DE cells by addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to Activin A-based culture medium and report its effects on the downstream differentiation to hepatocyte-like cells.Human embryonic stem cells (hESC) were differentiated to DE using standard methods in medium supplemented with 100ng/ml of Activin A and compared to cultures where DE specification was additionally enhanced with different concentrations of DMSO. DE cells were subsequently primed to generate hepatic-like cells to investigate whether the addition of DMSO during formation of DE improved subsequent expression of hepatic markers. A combination of flow cytometry, real-time quantitative reverse PCR and immunofluorescence was applied throughout the differentiation process to monitor expression of pluripotency (POUF5/OCT4 & NANOG), definitive endoderm (SOX17, CXCR4 & GATA4) and hepatic (AFP & ALB) genes to generate differentiation stage-specific signatures.Addition of DMSO to the Activin A-based medium during DE specification resulted in rapid down regulation of the pluripotency genes OCT4 and NANOG, accompanied by an increase expression of the DE genes SOX17, CXCR4 and GATA4. Importantly, the expression level of ALB in DMSO-treated cells was also higher than in cells which were differentiated to the DE stage via standard Activin A treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2068091177,"The transition from ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to invasive breast cancer (IBC) is a crucial step in breast cancer progression. The specific alterations that govern this transition have not been elucidated. HER2/neu is frequently overexpressed in DCIS but is less common in IBC, thereby suggesting additional requirements for transformation. To identify genes capable of cooperating with HER2/neu to fully transform mammary epithelial cells, we used an insertional mutagenesis screen on cells isolated from wild-type neu expressing mice and identified the E3 ligase HACE1 as HER2 cooperative tumor suppressor gene. Loss of HACE1 expression is commonly seen in clinical breast cancer data sets. HACE1 downregulation in normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) results in the accumulation of the activated GTP-bound Rac1 partially transforming these cells. Overexpression of HER2 activates Rac1, which further accumulates upon HACE1 loss resulting in Rac1 hyperactivation. Although the knockdown of HACE1 or overexpression of HER2 alone in HMECs is not sufficient for tumorigenesis, HER2 overexpression combined with HACE1 downregulation fully transforms HMECs resulting in robust tumor formation. The pharmaceutical interference of Rac function abrogates the effects of HACE1 loss both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in marked reduction in tumor burden. Our work supports a critical role for HACE1 in breast cancer progression and identifies patients that may benefit from Rac-targeted therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1585843179,"Purpose Skin temperature assessment has historically been undertaken with conductive devices affixed to the skin. With the development of technology, infrared devices are increasingly utilised in the measurement of skin temperature. Therefore, our purpose was to evaluate the agreement between four skin temperature devices at rest, during exercise in the heat, and recovery. Methods Mean skin temperature () was assessed in thirty healthy males during 30 min rest (24.0 ± 1.2°C, 56 ± 8%), 30 min cycle in the heat (38.0 ± 0.5°C, 41 ± 2%), and 45 min recovery (24.0 ± 1.3°C, 56 ± 9%). was assessed at four sites using two conductive devices (thermistors, iButtons) and two infrared devices (infrared thermometer, infrared camera). Results Bland–Altman plots demonstrated mean bias ± limits of agreement between the thermistors and iButtons as follows (rest, exercise, recovery): -0.01 ± 0.04, 0.26 ± 0.85, -0.37 ± 0.98°C; thermistors and infrared thermometer: 0.34 ± 0.44, -0.44 ± 1.23, -1.04 ± 1.75°C; thermistors and infrared camera (rest, recovery): 0.83 ± 0.77, 1.88 ± 1.87°C. Pairwise comparisons of found significant differences (p < 0.05) between thermistors and both infrared devices during resting conditions, and significant differences between the thermistors and all other devices tested during exercise in the heat and recovery. Conclusions These results indicate poor agreement between conductive and infrared devices at rest, during exercise in the heat, and subsequent recovery. Infrared devices may not be suitable for monitoring in the presence of, or following, metabolic and environmental induced heat stress."
https://openalex.org/W2042229191,"A truncation mutant of the epidermal growth factor receptor, EGFRvIII, is commonly expressed in glioma, an incurable brain cancer. EGFRvIII is tumorigenic, in part, through its transactivation of other receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Preventing the effects of this transactivation could form part of an effective therapy for glioma; however, the mechanism by which the transactivation occurs is unknown. Focusing on the RTK MET, we show that MET transactivation in U87MG human glioma cells in vitro is proportional to EGFRvIII activity and involves MET heterodimerization associated with a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) scaffold. The transactivation of certain other RTKs was, however, independent of FAK. Simultaneously targeting EGFRvIII (with panitumumab) and the transactivated RTKs themselves (with motesanib) in an intracranial mouse model of glioma resulted in significantly greater survival than with either agent alone, indicating that cotargeting these RTKs has potent antitumor efficacy and providing a strategy for treating EGFRvIII-expressing gliomas, which are usually refractory to treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2060543783,"Background Mammographic density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer and is highly variable, but, to date, few studies have examined density in Asian women, particularly those in low and middle-income Asian countries where genetic and lifestyle determinants may be significantly different. Methods A total of 1,240 women who attended an opportunistic mammogram screening programme were eligible for analysis. Mammographic density was estimated using a fully-automated thresholding method and differences across ethnic groups were examined using linear regression in 205 randomly selected Chinese women, 138 Malay and 199 Indian women. Results Percent density was significantly higher in Chinese women (28.5%; 95% CI 27.0%, 30.0%) compared to Malay (24.2%; 95% CI 22.5%, 26.0%) and Indian (24.3%; 95% CI 22.8%, 25.7%) women (p<0.001), after adjustment for age, BMI, menopausal status, parity and age at first full term pregnancy. Correspondingly, adjusted nondense area was significantly lower in Chinese (72.2cm2; 95% CI 67.9cm2, 76.5cm2) women compared to Malay (92.1cm2; 95% CI 86.9cm2, 97.2cm2) and Indian (97.7cm2; 95% CI 93.4cm2, 101.9cm2) women (p<0.001), but dense area did not differ across the three ethnic groups. Conclusions Our study shows that higher percent density and lower nondense area reflect the higher incidence of breast cancer in Chinese compared to Malay and Indian women in Malaysia. Known lifestyle determinants of mammographic density do not fully account for the ethnic variations observed in mammographic density in this Asian cohort."
https://openalex.org/W2054397328,"Objective To evaluate incidence of breastfeeding initiation according to maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) in “Grossesse en Santé”, a large prospective birth cohort in Quebec City. Methods Breastfeeding initiation in the post-partum period, pre-pregnancy BMI, sociodemographic determinants and obstetrical and neonatal factors were collected from years 2005 to 2010 in 6592 women with single pregnancies. Prenatal non-intention to breastfeed was documented in a subgroup of the cohort (years 2009–2010). Log-binomial regression analyses were performed to assess relative risk (RR) of non-initiation of breastfeeding between maternal BMI categories in models including pre- and post-natal determinants, after exclusion of variables with a mediating effect. Results Twenty percent (20%) of obese women did not initiate breastfeeding in the post-natal period at hospital compared to 12% for normal weight women. Compared with those having a normal pre-pregnancy BMI, obese women had a higher risk of non-initiation of breastfeeding (RRunadj 1.69, 95% CI 1.44–1.98), even after adjustment for prenatal and sociodemographic factors (RRadj 1.26, 95% CI 1.08–1.46). Furthermore, the risk of non-initiation of breastfeeding in obese women still remained higher after introduction of per- and post-natal factors (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04–1.42). The prenatal non-intention to breastfeed was strongly associated with the non-initiation of breastfeeding for all categories of BMI. Conclusion Maternal obesity is associated with a two-fold rate of non-initiation of breastfeeding. Considering the benefits of breastfeeding and the increasing obesity rate, adapted interventions and specialized support should target both pre- and immediate post-natal periods in this population."
https://openalex.org/W2082578748,"Kinases play fundamental roles in the brain. Through complex signaling pathways, kinases regulate the strength of protein:protein interactions (PPI) influencing cell cycle, signal transduction, and electrical activity of neurons. Changes induced by kinases on neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity and brain connectivity are linked to complex brain disorders, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these cellular events remain for the most part elusive. To further our understanding of brain disease, new methods for rapidly surveying kinase pathways in the cellular context are needed. The bioluminescence-based luciferase complementation assay (LCA) is a powerful, versatile toolkit for the exploration of PPI. LCA relies on the complementation of two firefly luciferase protein fragments that are functionally reconstituted into the full luciferase enzyme by two interacting binding partners. Here, we applied LCA in live cells to assay 12 kinase pathways as regulators of the PPI complex formed by the voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.6, a transmembrane ion channel that elicits the action potential in neurons and mediates synaptic transmission, and its multivalent accessory protein, the fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14). Through extensive dose-dependent validations of structurally-diverse kinase inhibitors and hierarchical clustering, we identified the PI3K/Akt pathway, the cell-cycle regulator Wee1 kinase, and protein kinase C (PKC) as prospective regulatory nodes of neuronal excitability through modulation of the FGF14:Nav1.6 complex. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis shows convergence of these pathways on glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and functional assays demonstrate that inhibition of GSK3 impairs excitability of hippocampal neurons. This combined approach provides a versatile toolkit for rapidly surveying PPI signaling, allowing the discovery of new modular pathways centered on GSK3 that might be the basis for functional alterations between the normal and diseased brain."
https://openalex.org/W1992243940,"The human IgG1 antibody subclass shows distinct properties compared with the IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 subclasses and is the most exploited subclass in therapeutic antibodies. It is the most abundant subclass, has a half-life as long as that of IgG2 and IgG4, binds the FcγR receptor, and activates complement. There is limited structural information on full-length human IgG1 because of the challenges of crystallization. To rectify this, we have studied the solution structures of two human IgG1 6a and 19a monoclonal antibodies in different buffers at different temperatures. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that both antibodies were predominantly monomeric, with sedimentation coefficients s20,w (0) of 6.3-6.4 S. Only a minor dimer peak was observed, and the amount was not dependent on buffer conditions. Solution scattering showed that the x-ray radius of gyration Rg increased with salt concentration, whereas the neutron Rg values remained unchanged with temperature. The x-ray and neutron distance distribution curves P(r) revealed two peaks, M1 and M2, whose positions were unchanged in different buffers to indicate conformational stability. Constrained atomistic scattering modeling revealed predominantly asymmetric solution structures for both antibodies with extended hinge structures. Both structures were similar to the only known crystal structure of full-length human IgG1. The Fab conformations in both structures were suitably positioned to permit the Fc region to bind readily to its FcγR and C1q ligands without steric clashes, unlike human IgG4. Our molecular models for human IgG1 explain its immune activities, and we discuss its stability and function for therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W2057459090,"Objectives This study estimates HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Jamaica and explores social determinants of HIV infection among MSM. Design An island-wide cross-sectional survey of MSM recruited by peer referral and outreach was conducted in 2011. A structured questionnaire was administered and HIV/STI tests done. We compared three groups: MSM who accepted cash for sex within the past 3 months (MSM SW), MSM who did not accept cash for sex (MSM non-SW), and MSM with adverse life events (ever raped, jailed, homeless, victim of violence or low literacy). Results HIV prevalence among 449 MSM was 31.4%, MSM SW 41.1%, MSM with adverse life events 38.5%, 17 transgender MSM (52.9%), and MSM non-SW without adverse events 21.0%. HIV prevalence increased with age and number of adverse life events (test for trend P < 0.001), as did STI prevalence (P = 0.03). HIV incidence was 6.7 cases/100 person-years (95% CI: 3.74, 12.19). HIV prevalence was highest among MSM reporting high-risk sex; MSM SW who had been raped (65.0%), had a STI (61.2%) and who self identified as female (55.6%). Significant risk factors for HIV infection common to all 3 subgroups were participation in both receptive and insertive anal intercourse, high-risk sex, and history of a STI. Perception of no or little risk, always using a condom, and being bisexual were protective. Conclusion HIV prevalence was high among MSM SW and MSM with adverse life events. Given the characteristics of the sample, HIV prevalence among MSM in Jamaica is probably in the range of 20%. The study illustrates the importance of social vulnerability in driving the HIV epidemic. Programs to empower young MSM, reduce social vulnerability and other structural barriers including stigma and discrimination against MSM are critical to reduce HIV transmission."

Conventional multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays confirmed the presence of the aggR gene (69%), ipaH gene (23%) and the stx gene (15%) carried by Enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and Enterohermorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), respectively, in river water samples collected from the Berg River (Paarl, South Africa). Only the aggR gene was present in 23% of samples collected from the Plankenburg River system (Stellenbosch, South Africa). In a comparative study, real-time multiplex PCR assays confirmed the presence of aggR (EAEC) in 69%, stx (EHEC) in 15%, ipaH (EIEC) in 31% and eae (EPEC) in 8% of the river water samples collected from the Berg River. In the Plankenburg River, aggR (EAEC) was detected in 46% of the samples, while eae (EPEC) was present in 15% of the water samples analyzed using real-time multiplex PCR in the Plankenburg River. Pearson Chi-square showed that there was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) between the conventional and real-time multiplex PCRs for the detection of virulent E. coli genes in water samples. However, the McNemar’s test showed some variation in the co-detection of virulent E. coli genes, for example, there was no statistical difference in the misclassification of the discordant results for stx versus ipaH, which implies that the ipaH gene was frequently detected with the stx gene. This study thus highlights the presence of virulent E. coli genes in river water and while early detection is crucial, quantitative microbial risk analysis has to be performed to identify and estimate the risk to human health."
https://openalex.org/W1986164938,"Sister chromatid cohesion is established during replication by entrapment of both dsDNAs within the cohesin ring complex. It is dissolved in anaphase when separase, a giant cysteine endopeptidase, cleaves the Scc1/Rad21 subunit of cohesin, thereby triggering chromosome segregation. Separase is held inactive by association with securin until this anaphase inhibitor is destroyed at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition by ubiquitin-dependent degradation. The relevant ubiquitin ligase, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, also targets cyclin B1, thereby causing inactivation of Cdk1 and mitotic exit. Although separase is essential, securin knock-out mice are surprisingly viable and fertile. Capitalizing on our previous finding that Cdk1-cyclin B1 can also bind and inhibit separase, we investigated whether this kinase might be suitable to maintain faithful timing and execution of anaphase in the absence of securin. We found that, similar to securin, Cdk1-cyclin B1 regulates separase in both a positive and negative manner. Although securin associates with nascent separase to co-translationally assist proper folding, Cdk1-cyclin B1 acts on native state separase. Upon entry into mitosis, Cdk1-cyclin B1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser-1126 renders separase prone to inactivation by aggregation/precipitation. Stable association of Cdk1-cyclin B1 with phosphorylated separase counteracts this tendency and stabilizes separase in an inhibited yet activatable state. These opposing effects are suited to prevent premature cleavage of cohesin in early mitosis while ensuring timely activation of separase by anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome-dependent degradation of cyclin B1. Coupling sister chromatid separation with subsequent exit from mitosis by this simplified mode might have been the common scheme of mitotic control prior to the evolution of securin.

https://openalex.org/W2038387729,"The delivery of primary care to homeless individuals with mental health conditions presents unique challenges. To inform healthcare improvement, we studied predictors of favorable primary care experience among homeless persons with mental health conditions treated at sites that varied in degree of homeless-specific service tailoring. This was a multi-site, survey-based comparison of primary care experiences at three mainstream primary care clinics of the Veterans Administration (VA), one homeless-tailored VA clinic, and one tailored non-VA healthcare program. Persons who accessed primary care service two or more times from July 2008 through June 2010 (N = 366) were randomly sampled. Predictor variables included patient and organization characteristics suggested by the patient perception model developed by Sofaer and Firminger (2005), with an emphasis on mental health. The primary care experience was assessed with the Primary Care Quality-Homeless (PCQ-H) questionnaire, a validated survey instrument. Multiple regression identified predictors of positive experiences (i.e. higher PCQ-H total score). Significant predictors of a positive experience included a site offering tailored service design, perceived choice among providers, and currently domiciled status. There was an interaction effect between site and severe psychiatric symptoms. For persons with severe psychiatric symptoms, a homeless-tailored service design was significantly associated with a more favorable primary care experience. For persons without severe psychiatric symptoms, this difference was not significant. This study supports the importance of tailored healthcare delivery designed for homeless persons’ needs, with such services potentially holding special relevance for persons with mental health conditions. To improve patient experience among the homeless, organizations may want to deliver services that are tailored to homelessness and offer a choice of providers."
https://openalex.org/W1986186902,"Consumption of Pu-erh has been reported to result in numerous health benefits, but the mechanisms underlying purported weight-loss and lowering of lipid are poorly understood. Here, we used the nematode Caenorhaditis elegans to explore the water extract of Pu-erh tea (PTE) functions to reduce fat storage. We found that PTE down-regulates the expression of the master fat regulator SBP-1, a homologue of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) and its target stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), a key enzyme in fat biosynthesis, leading to an increased ratio of stearic acid (C18:0) to oleic acid (C18:1n-9), and subsequently decreased fat storage. We also found that both the pharyngeal pumping rate and food uptake of C. elegans decreased with exposure to PTE. Collectively, these results provide an experimental basis for explaining the ability of Pu-erh tea in promoting inhibition of food uptake and the biosynthesis of fat via SBP-1 and SCD, thereby reducing fat storage."

We did not observe any differences in the kinetics of the protochlorophyllide photoreduction at room temperature among the PORA, PORB and PORC proteins. In contrast, the PORC protein showed lower yield of Chlide formation than PORA and PORB when preincubated in the dark for 30 min and then illuminated for a short time. The most significant observation was that reconstituted Pchlide-POR-NADPH complexes showed fluorescence maxima at 77 K similar to those observed for highly aggregated Pchlide-POR-NADPH complexes in prolamellar bodies (PLBs) in vivo. Homology models of PORA, PORB and PORC of Arabidopsis thaliana were developed to compare predicted structures of POR isoforms. There were only slight structural differences, mainly in the organisation of helices and loops, but not in the shape of whole molecules. This is the first comparative analysis of all POR isoforms functioning at different stages of A. thaliana development."
https://openalex.org/W2073423152,"We previously found that peroxisomal biogenesis factor 11a (Pex11a) deficiency is associated with a reduction in peroxisome abundance and impaired fatty acid metabolism in hepatocytes, and results in steatosis. In the present study, we investigated whether butyrate induces Pex11a expression and peroxisome proliferation, and studied its effect on lipid metabolism. C57BL/6 mice fed standard chow or a high-fat diet (HFD) were treated with tributyrin, 4-phelybutyrate acid (4-PBA), or the butyrate-producing probiotics (Clostridium butyricum MIYAIRI 588 [CBM]) plus inulin (dietary fiber), and the body weight, white adipose tissue, serum triglycerides, mRNA expression, and peroxisome abundance were evaluated. Tributyrin or 4-PBA treatment significantly decreased body weight and increased hepatic mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPARα) and Pex11a. In addition, 4-PBA treatment increased peroxisome abundance and the expression of genes involved in peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation (acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 and hydroxysteroid [17-beta] dehydrogenase 4). CBM and inulin administration reduced adipose tissue mass and serum triglycerides, induced Pex11a, acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1, and hydroxysteroid (17-beta) dehydrogenase 4 genes, and increased peroxisome abundance in mice fed standard chow or an HFD. In conclusion, elevation of butyrate availability (directly through administration of butyrate or indirectly via administration of butyrate-producing probiotics plus fiber) induces PPARα and Pex11a and the genes involved in peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation, increases peroxisome abundance, and improves lipid metabolism. These results may provide a new therapeutic strategy against hyperlipidemia and obesity."

Non-motor symptoms and signs such as psychiatric disturbances, sleep problems and metabolic dysfunction are part of the disease manifestation. These aspects may relate to changes in the hypothalamus, an area of the brain involved in the regulation of emotion, sleep and metabolism. Neuropathological and imaging studies using both voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as positron emission tomography (PET) have demonstrated pathological changes in the hypothalamic region during early stages in symptomatic HD. In this investigation, we aimed to establish a robust method for measurements of the hypothalamic volume in MRI in order to determine whether the hypothalamic dysfunction in HD is associated with the volume of this region. Using T1-weighted imaging, we describe a reproducible delineation procedure to estimate the hypothalamic volume which was based on the same landmarks used in histologically processed postmortem hypothalamic tissue. Participants included 36 prodromal HD (pre-HD), 33 symptomatic HD (symp-HD) and 33 control participants who underwent MRI scanning at baseline and 18 months follow-up as part of the IMAGE-HD study. We found no evidence of cross-sectional or longitudinal changes between groups in hypothalamic volume. Our results suggest that hypothalamic pathology in HD is not associated with volume changes."

Transcriptional profiling between M. tuberculosis H37Rv and a ΔnarL mutant strain during exponential growth in broth cultures with or without nitrate defined an ∼30-gene NarL regulon that exhibited significant overlap with DevR-regulated genes, thereby implicating a role for the DevR response regulator in the regulation of nitrate metabolism. Notably, expression analysis of a subset of genes common to NarL and DevR regulons in M. tuberculosis ΔdevR, ΔdevSΔdosT, and ΔnarL mutant strains revealed that in response to nitrite produced during aerobic nitrate metabolism, the DevRS/DosT regulatory system plays a primary role that is augmented by NarL. Specifically, NarL itself was unable to bind to the narK2, acg, and Rv3130c promoters in phosphorylated or unphosphorylated form; however, its interaction with DevR∼P resulted in cooperative binding, thereby enabling co-regulation of these genes.

https://openalex.org/W2089891477,"Background and Aims Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) is a non-tyrosine kinase receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and class 3 semaphorins, playing a role in angiogenesis and neuronal axon guidance, respectively. NRP1 is expressed in smooth muscle cells (SMC) but the functional role of NRP1 in SMC has not been elucidated. We therefore investigated the biological relevance of NRP1 in SMC in vivo by generating mice with SMC-specific Nrp1 deficiency. Methods Conditional gene targeting generated SMC-specific Nrp1 knockout mice (Nrp1SMKO) in which Cre recombinase is driven by the smooth muscle-specific myosin heavy chain (smMHC) promoter. Results SMC-specific Nrp1 deficiency resulted in a significant reduction in intestinal length by 6 months, and, by 18 months, in severe constipation, and enlargement of the intestine consistent with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. These effects were associated with significant thinning of the intestinal smooth muscle, and decreased intestinal contractility. Expression of contractile proteins was reduced in Nrp1SMKO mice, including the smMHC isoform, SMB, whereas we observed a significant increase in the expression of the small-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel 3 (SK3/KCa2.3), implicated in negative regulation of smooth muscle contraction. Conclusions Nrp1 deficiency in visceral SMC results in adult-onset defects in gastrointestinal contractility and motility and causes a shift to a less contractile SMC phenotype. These findings indicate a new role for Nrp1 in the maintenance of the visceral SMC contractile phenotype required for normal GI motility in aged mice."
https://openalex.org/W1977391109,"Sepsis, a devastating and often lethal complication of severe infection, is characterized by fever and dysregulated inflammation. While infections activate the inflammatory response in part through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), fever can partially activate the heat shock response with generation of heat shock proteins (HSPs). Since extracellular HSPs, especially HSP70 (eHSP70), are proinflammatory TLR agonists, we investigated how exposure to the TLR4 agonist, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and febrile range hyperthermia (FRH; 39.5°C) modify HSP70 expression and extracellular release. Using differentiated THP1 cells, we found that concurrent exposure to FRH and LPS as well as TLR2 and TLR3 agonists synergized to activate expression of inducible HSP72 (HSPA1A) mRNA and protein via a p38 MAP kinase-requiring mechanism. Treatment with LPS for 6 h stimulated eHSP70 release; levels of eHSP70 released at 39.5°C were higher than at 37°C roughly paralleling the increase in intracellular HSP72 in the 39.5°C cells. By contrast, 6 h exposure to FRH in the absence of LPS failed to promote eHSP70 release. Release of eHSP70 by LPS-treated THP1 cells was inhibited by glibenclamide, but not brefeldin, indicating that eHSP70 secretion occurred via a non-classical protein secretory mechanism. Analysis of eHSP70 levels in exosomes and exosome-depleted culture supernatants from LPS-treated THP1 cells using ELISA demonstrated similar eHSP70 levels in unfractionated and exosome-depleted culture supernatants, indicating that LPS-stimulated eHSP70 release did not occur via the exosome pathway. Immunoblot analysis of the exosome fraction of culture supernatants from these cells showed constitutive HSC70 (HSPA8) to be the predominant HSP70 family member present in exosomes. In summary, we have shown that LPS stimulates macrophages to secrete inducible HSP72 via a non-classical non-exosomal pathway while synergizing with FRH exposure to increase both intracellular and secreted levels of inducible HSP72. The impact of increased macrophage intracellular HSP70 levels and augmented secretion of proinflammatory eHSP70 in the febrile, infected patient remains to be elucidated."

Dpb11 binds to S-phase cyclin-dependent kinase-phosphorylated Sld2 and Sld3 to form a ternary complex during S phase.

We show here, using purified proteins from budding yeast, that Dpb11 alone binds to Mcm2-7 and that Dpb11 also competes with GINS for binding to Mcm2-7. Furthermore, Dpb11 binds directly to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and ssDNA inhibits the Dpb11 interaction with Mcm2-7. We also found that Dpb11 can recruit Cdc45 to Mcm2-7. We identified a mutant of the BRCT4 motif of Dpb11 that remains bound to Mcm2-7 in the presence of ssDNA (dpb11-m1,m2,m3,m5), and this mutant exhibits a DNA replication defect when expressed in budding yeast cells. Expression of this mutant results in increased interaction between Dpb11 and Mcm2-7 during S phase, impaired GINS interaction with Mcm2-7 during S phase, and decreased replication protein A (RPA) interaction with origin DNA during S phase. We propose a model in which Dpb11 first recruits Cdc45 to Mcm2-7. Dpb11, although bound to Cdc45·Mcm2-7, can block the interaction between GINS and Mcm2-7. Upon extrusion of ssDNA from the central channel of Mcm2-7, Dpb11 dissociates from Mcm2-7, and Dpb11 binds to ssDNA, thereby allowing GINS to bind to Cdc45·Mcm2-7.

Although there is considerable understanding of the molecular mechanisms that allow KLF3 to silence the activity of its target genes, less is known about the signal transduction pathways and post-translational modifications that modulate KLF3 activity in response to physiological stimuli. We observed that KLF3 is modified in a range of different tissues and found that the serine/threonine kinase homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) can both bind and phosphorylate KLF3. Mass spectrometry identified serine 249 as the primary phosphorylation site. Mutation of this site reduces the ability of KLF3 to bind DNA and repress transcription. Furthermore, we also determined that HIPK2 can phosphorylate the KLF3 co-repressor C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2) at serine 428. Finally, we found that phosphorylation of KLF3 and CtBP2 by HIPK2 strengthens the interaction between these two factors and increases transcriptional repression by KLF3.

https://openalex.org/W1982435944,"Spondylocostal dysostosis is a congenital disorder of the axial skeleton documented in human families from diverse racial backgrounds. The condition is characterised by truncal shortening, extensive hemivertebrae and rib anomalies including malalignment, fusion and reduction in number. Mutations in the Notch signalling pathway genes DLL3, MESP2, LFNG, HES7 and TBX6 have been associated with this defect. In this study, spondylocostal dysostosis in an outbred family of miniature schnauzer dogs is described. Computed tomography demonstrated that the condition mirrors the skeletal defects observed in human cases, but unlike most human cases, the affected dogs were stillborn or died shortly after birth. Through gene mapping and whole genome sequencing, we identified a single-base deletion in the coding region of HES7. The frameshift mutation causes loss of functional domains essential for the oscillatory transcriptional autorepression of HES7 during somitogenesis. A restriction fragment length polymorphism test was applied within the immediate family and supported a highly penetrant autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The mutation was not observed in wider testing of 117 randomly sampled adult miniature schnauzer and six adult standard schnauzer dogs; providing a significance of association of Praw = 4.759e-36 (genome-wide significant). Despite this apparently low frequency in the Australian population, the allele may be globally distributed based on its presence in two unrelated sires from geographically distant locations. While isolated hemivertebrae have been observed in a small number of other dog breeds, this is the first clinical and genetic diagnosis of spontaneously occurring spondylocostal dysostosis in a non-human mammal and offers an excellent model in which to study this devastating human disorder. The genetic test can be utilized by dog breeders to select away from the disease and avoid unnecessary neonatal losses."
https://openalex.org/W2139499629,"The small GTPase Rac1 is crucial for maintaining stem cells (SCs) in mammalian epidermis, and Rac1 activation leads to SC expansion. Loss or inhibition of Rac1 correlates with decreased frequency of skin cancer formation in a chemical carcinogenesis model. Here, we have addressed whether Rac1 activation would enhance carcinogenesis and result in tumor progression. We used K14ΔNLef1 mice, a model for differentiated sebaceous adenomas (SAs), and activated Rac1 in an epidermis-specific manner (K14L61Rac1). Surprisingly, Rac1 activation did not change the incidence and frequency of sebaceous tumors. However, tumors, which occurred exclusively in K14ΔNLef1/K14L61Rac1 double-transgenic mice, were poorly differentiated resembling malignant sebaceous tumors and were termed sebaceous carcinoma-like tumors (SCLTs). Compared with SAs, SCLTs showed an aberrant pattern of cell proliferation, invasive growth and less abundant expression of sebocyte differentiation markers, including stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 and adipophilin. Interestingly, the adnexal SC marker Lrig1 was upregulated in SCLTs, showing that active Rac1 leads to the accumulation of sebocyte precursors in the context of K14ΔNLef1-induced skin tumors. In a search for targets of Rac1, we found cancer progression-related proteins, Dhcr24/Seladin1 and Nuclear protein 1/P8, to be strongly regulated in SCLTs. At last, Rac1 and Dhcr24/Seladin1 were detected in human sebaceous tumors demonstrating a potential high impact of our findings for human skin disease. This is the first study showing that Rac1 activity can lead to malignant progression of skin tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1989518283,"RanBPM/RanBP9 is a ubiquitous, nucleocytoplasmic protein that is part of an evolutionary conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase complex whose function and targets in mammals are still unknown. RanBPM itself has been implicated in various cellular processes that involve both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions. However, to date, little is known about how RanBPM subcellular localization is regulated. We have conducted a systematic analysis of RanBPM regions that control its subcellular localization using RanBPM shRNA cells to examine ectopic RanBPM mutant subcellular localization without interference from the endogenously expressed protein. We show that several domains and motifs regulate RanBPM nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. In particular, RanBPM comprises two motifs that can confer nuclear localization, one proline/glutamine-rich motif in the extreme N-terminus which has a dominant effect on RanBPM localization, and a second motif in the C-terminus which minimally contributes to RanBPM nuclear targeting. We also identified a nuclear export signal (NES) which mutation prevented RanBPM accumulation in the cytoplasm. Likewise, deletion of the central RanBPM conserved domains (SPRY and LisH/CTLH) resulted in the relocalization of RanBPM to the nucleus, suggesting that RanBPM cytoplasmic localization is also conferred by protein-protein interactions that promote its cytoplasmic retention. Indeed we found that in the cytoplasm, RanBPM partially colocalizes with microtubules and associates with α-tubulin. Finally, in the nucleus, a significant fraction of RanBPM is associated with chromatin. Altogether, these analyses reveal that RanBPM subcellular localization results from the combined effects of several elements that either confer direct transport through the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery or regulate it indirectly, likely through interactions with other proteins and by intramolecular folding."
https://openalex.org/W2042940459,"Tumour cells often acquire the ability to escape cell death, a key event leading to the development of cancer. In almost half of all human cancers, the capability to induce cell death is reduced by the mutation and inactivation of p53, a tumour suppressor protein that is a central regulator of apoptosis. As a result, there is a crucial need to identify different cell death pathways that could be targeted in malignancies lacking p53. p73, the closely related p53 family member, can regulate many p53 target genes and therefore some of the same cellular responses as p53. Unlike p53, however, p73 is seldom mutated in cancer, making it an attractive, alternative death effector to target. We report here the ability of p73 to upregulate the expression of the A2B receptor, a recently characterized p53 target that effectively promotes cell death in response to extracellular adenosine--a metabolite that accumulates during various forms of cellular stress. Importantly, we show that p73-dependent stimulation of A2B signalling markedly enhances apoptosis in cancer cells that are devoid of p53. This mode of death is caspase- and puma-dependent, and can be prevented by the overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-X(L). Moreover, treatment of p53-null cancer cells with the chemotherapeutic drug adriamycin (doxorubicin) induces A2B in a p73-dependent manner and, in combination with an A2B agonist, substantially enhances apoptotic death. We therefore propose an alternate and distinct p53-independent pathway to stimulate programmed cell death involving p73-mediated engagement of adenosine signalling."
https://openalex.org/W1999863914,"To evaluate hepatic fat fraction on dual- and triple-echo gradient-recalled echo MRI sequences in healthy children.We retrospectively reviewed the records of children in a medical check-up clinic from May 2012 to November 2013. We excluded children with abnormal laboratory findings or those who were overweight. Hepatic fat fraction was measured on dual- and triple-echo sequences using 3T MRI. We compared fat fractions using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement. The correlation between fat fractions and clinical and laboratory findings was evaluated using Spearman's correlation test, and the cut-off values of fat fractions for diagnosing fatty liver were obtained from reference intervals.In 54 children (M:F = 26:28; 5-15 years; mean 9 years), the dual fat fraction (0.1-8.0%; median 1.6%) was not different from the triple fat fraction (0.4-6.5%; median 2.7%) (p = 0.010). The dual- and triple-echo fat fractions showed good agreement using a Bland-Altman plot (-0.6 ± 2.8%). Eight children (14.8%) on dual-echo sequences and six (11.1%) on triple-echo sequences had greater than 5% fat fraction. From these children, six out of eight children on dual-echo sequences and four out of six children on triple-echo sequences had a 5-6% hepatic fat fraction. When using a cut-off value of a 6% fat fraction derived from a reference interval, only 3.7% of children were diagnosed with fatty liver. There was no significant correlation between clinical and laboratory findings with dual and triple-echo fat fractions.Dual fat fraction was not different from triple fat fraction. We suggest a cut-off value of a 6% fat fraction is more appropriate for diagnosing fatty liver on both dual- and triple-echo sequences in children."
https://openalex.org/W2083577592,"Aims Although we previously demonstrated abdominal paracentesis drainage (APD) preceding percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) as the central step for treating patients with moderately severe (MSAP) or severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), the predictors leading to PCD after APD have not been studied. Methods Consecutive patients with MSAP or SAP were recruited between June 2011 and June 2013. As a step-up approach, all patients initially received medical management, later underwent ultrasound-guided APD before PCD, if necessary, followed by endoscopic necrosectomy through the path formed by PCD. APD primarily targeted fluid in the abdominal or pelvic cavities, whereas PCD aimed at (peri)pancreatic fluid. Results Of the 92 enrolled patients, 40 were managed with APD alone and 52 received PCD after APD (14 required necrosectomy after initial PCD). The overall mortality was 6.5%. Univariate analysis showed that among the 20 selected parameters, 13 factors significantly affected PCD intervention after APD. Multivariate analysis revealed that infected (peri)pancreatic collections (P = -0.001), maximum extent of necrosis of more than 30% of the pancreas (P = -0.024), size of the largest necrotic peri(pancreatic) collection (P = -0.007), and reduction of (peri)pancreatic fluid collections by <50% after APD (P = -0.008) were all independent predictors of PCD. Conclusions Infected (peri)pancreatic collections, a largest necrotic peri(pancreatic) collection of more than 100 ml, and reduction of (peri)pancreatic fluid collections by <50% after APD could effectively predict the need for PCD in the early course of the disease."

In order to investigate the association of HLA Class I and II alleles and dengue disease severity in a cohort of Filipino children, we performed a case control study in 2 hospitals in Metro Manila from June 2008 to December 2009. A total of 250 laboratory confirmed dengue patients and 300 healthy individuals aged 5 to 15 years old were typed for HLA-A, B and DRB1 alleles. The frequency of HLA-A*33:01 was significantly decreased in severe dengue (DHF/ DSS; Pc = 0.0016)) and DSS (Pc = 0.0032) compared to the background population. These findings support a previous study that this allele may confer protection against the severe form of dengue and provide the first evidence of HLA association with dengue in the Philippines. Future studies should be directed in investigating the possible mechanisms of protection."
https://openalex.org/W2094808103,"ATP-binding cassette sub-family E member 1 (ABCE1) is a highly conserved protein among eukaryotes and archaea. Recent studies have identified ABCE1 as a ribosome-recycling factor important for translation termination in mammalian cells, yeast and also archaea. Here we report another conserved function of ABCE1. We have previously described AtRLI2, the homolog of ABCE1 in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, as an endogenous suppressor of RNA silencing. In this study we show that this function is conserved: human ABCE1 is able to suppress RNA silencing in Nicotiana benthamiana plants, in mammalian HEK293 cells and in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Using co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we found a number of potential ABCE1-interacting proteins that might support its function as an endogenous suppressor of RNA interference. The interactor candidates are associated with epigenetic regulation, transcription, RNA processing and mRNA surveillance. In addition, one of the identified proteins is translin, which together with its binding partner TRAX supports RNA interference."

We describe Ultra-fast Shape Recognition with Atom Types (UFSRAT), an efficient algorithm that considers both the 3D distribution (shape) and electrostatics of atoms to score and retrieve molecules capable of making similar interactions to those of the supplied query. Results Computational optimization and pre-calculation of molecular descriptors enables a query molecule to be run against a database containing 3.8 million molecules and results returned in under 10 seconds on modest hardware. UFSRAT has been used in pipelines to identify bioactive molecules for two clinically relevant drug targets; FK506-Binding Protein 12 and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1. In the case of FK506-Binding Protein 12, UFSRAT was used as the first step in a structure-based virtual screening pipeline, yielding many actives, of which the most active shows a KD, app of 281 µM and contains a substructure present in the query compound. Success was also achieved running solely the UFSRAT technique to identify new actives for 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, for which the most active displays an IC50 of 67 nM in a cell based assay and contains a substructure radically different to the query. This demonstrates the valuable ability of the UFSRAT algorithm to perform scaffold hops.

https://openalex.org/W2091549291,"Background Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been employed for decades as a non-pharmacologic treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although a link has been suggested between PTSD and impaired sensorimotor gating (SG), studies assessing the effects of rTMS against PTSD or PTSD with impaired SG are scarce. Aim To assess the benefit of rTMS in a rat model of PTSD. Methods Using a modified single prolonged stress (SPS&S) rat model of PTSD, behavioral parameters were acquired using open field test (OFT), elevated plus maze test (EPMT), and prepulse inhibition trial (PPI), with or without 7 days of high frequency (10Hz) rTMS treatment of SPS&S rats. Results Anxiety-like behavior, impaired SG and increased plasma level of cortisol were observed in SPS&S animals after stress for a prolonged time. Interestingly, rTMS administered immediately after stress prevented those impairment. Conclusion Stress-induced anxiety-like behavior, increased plasma level of cortisol and impaired PPI occur after stress and high-frequency rTMS has the potential to ameliorate this behavior, suggesting that high frequency rTMS should be further evaluated for its use as a method for preventing PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W2108726068,"Despite the substantial knowledge on the antidiabetic, antiobesity and antihypertensive actions of tungstate, information on its primary target/s is scarce. Tungstate activates both the ERK1/2 pathway and the vascular voltage- and Ca2+-dependent large-conductance BKαβ1 potassium channel, which modulates vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and function, respectively. Here, we have assessed the possible involvement of BKαβ1 channels in the tungstate-induced ERK phosphorylation and its relevance for VSMC proliferation. Western blot analysis in HEK cell lines showed that expression of vascular BKαβ1 channels potentiates the tungstate-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a Gi/o protein-dependent manner. Tungstate activated BKαβ1 channels upstream of G proteins as channel activation was not altered by the inhibition of G proteins with GDPβS or pertussis toxin. Moreover, analysis of Gi/o protein activation measuring the FRET among heterologously expressed Gi protein subunits suggested that tungstate-targeting of BKαβ1 channels promotes G protein activation. Single channel recordings on VSMCs from wild-type and β1-knockout mice indicated that the presence of the regulatory β1 subunit was essential for the tungstate-mediated activation of BK channels in VSMCs. Moreover, the specific BK channel blocker iberiotoxin lowered tungstate-induced ERK phosphorylation by 55% and partially reverted (by 51%) the tungstate-produced reduction of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced proliferation in human VSMCs. Our observations indicate that tungstate-targeting of BKαβ1 channels promotes activation of PTX-sensitive Gi proteins to enhance the tungstate-induced phosphorylation of ERK, and inhibits PDGF-stimulated cell proliferation in human vascular smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2008335425,"G protein β subunits (Gβ) play essential roles in phototransduction as part of G protein βγ (Gβγ) and regulator of G protein signaling 9 (RGS9)-Gβ5 heterodimers. Both are obligate dimers that rely on the cytosolic chaperone CCT and its co-chaperone PhLP1 to form complexes from their nascent polypeptides. The importance of PhLP1 in the assembly process was recently demonstrated in vivo in a retinal rod-specific deletion of the Phlp1 gene. To test whether this is a general mechanism that also applies to other cell types, we disrupted the Phlp1 gene specifically in mouse cones and measured the effects on G protein expression and cone visual signal transduction. In PhLP1-deficient cones, expression of cone transducin (Gt2) and RGS9-Gβ5 subunits was dramatically reduced, resulting in a 27-fold decrease in sensitivity and a 38-fold delay in cone photoresponse recovery. These results demonstrate the essential role of PhLP1 in cone G protein complex formation. Our findings reveal a common mechanism of Gβγ and RGS9-Gβ5 assembly in rods and cones, highlighting the importance of PhLP1 and CCT-mediated Gβ complex formation in G protein signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2010521473,"Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2 (c-IAP1/2) have central roles in signal transduction mediated by numerous receptors that participate in inflammatory and immune responses. In certain pathways, such as activation of NF-κB, their degradation is a major regulatory event and is physiologically induced by activation of receptors. In addition, a number of synthetic compounds have been developed that also target the c-IAPs and induce their degradation. However, the extent of a synthetic IAP antagonist’s ability to mirror the transcriptional program by a physiological signal remains unclear. Here we take a systems approach to compare the transcriptional programs triggered by activation of CD30, a well-characterized receptor previously shown to induce the degradation of the c-IAPs, to SM-164, a synthetic IAP antagonist that specifically triggers c-IAP degradation. Employing a technique that allows the specific analysis of newly transcribed RNA, we have generated comparative transcriptome profiles for CD30 activation and SM-164 treatment. Analysis of these profiles revealed that the genes regulated by each stimulus were not completely shared, indicating novel functions of IAP antagonists and consequences of c-IAP1/2 degradation. The data identified a role for c-IAP1/2 in the regulation of the ribosome and protein synthesis, which was subsequently confirmed by biological assays. These findings expand our knowledge of the roles of c-IAP1/2 in signaling and provide insight into the mechanism of synthetic IAP antagonists, furthering our understanding of their therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2008135647,"Objectives To apply contact measurement and reference point system (RPS) alignment techniques to establish a method for 3D reconstruction of the edentulous jaw models with centric relation and to quantitatively evaluate its accuracy. Methods Upper and lower edentulous jaw models were clinically prepared, 10 pairs of resin cylinders with same size were adhered to axial surfaces of upper and lower models. The occlusal bases and the upper and lower jaw models were installed in the centric relation position. Faro Edge 1.8m was used to directly obtain center points of the base surface of the cylinders (contact method). Activity 880 dental scanner was used to obtain 3D data of the cylinders and the center points were fitted (fitting method). 3 pairs of center points were used to align the virtual model to centric relation. An observation coordinate system was interactively established. The straight-line distances in the X (horizontal left/right), Y (horizontal anterior/posterior), and Z (vertical) between the remaining 7 pairs of center points derived from contact method and fitting method were measured respectively and analyzed using a paired t-test. Results The differences of the straight-line distances of the remaining 7 pairs of center points between the two methods were X: 0.074 ± 0.107 mm, Y: 0.168 ± 0.176 mm, and Z: −0.003± 0.155 mm. The results of paired t-test were X and Z: p >0.05, Y: p <0.05. Conclusion By using contact measurement and the reference point system alignment technique, highly accurate reconstruction of the vertical distance and centric relation of a digital edentulous jaw model can be achieved, which meets the design and manufacturing requirements of the complete dentures. The error of horizontal anterior/posterior jaw relation was relatively large."
https://openalex.org/W2092698106,"Deficits in attentional-inhibitory control have been reported to correlate to anger, hostility, and aggressive behavior; therefore, inhibitory control appears to play an important role in prosocial behavior. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that oxytocin (OT) exerts a prosocial effect (e.g., decreasing negative behaviors, such as aggression) on humans. However, it is unknown whether the positively valenced effect of OT on sociality is associated with enhanced attentional-inhibitory control. In the present study, we hypothesized that OT enhances attentional-inhibitory control and that the positively valenced effect of OT on social cognition is associated with enhanced attentional-inhibitory control. In a single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, we tested this hypothesis using 20 healthy male volunteers. We considered a decrease in the hostility detection ratio, which reflects the positively valenced interpretation of other individuals’ facial expressions, to be an index of the positively valenced effects of OT (we reused the results of our previously published study). As a measure of attentional-inhibitory control, we employed a modified version of the flanker task (i.e., a shorter conflict duration indicated higher inhibitory control). These results failed to demonstrate any significant behavioral effects of OT (i.e., neither a positively valenced effect on facial cognition nor an effect on attentional-inhibitory control). However, the enhancement of attentional-inhibitory control after OT administration significantly correlated to the positively valenced effects on the interpretation of uncertain facial cognition (i.e., neutral and ambiguous facial expressions)."
https://openalex.org/W2035163215,"Numerous activities require an individual to respond quickly to the correct stimulus. The provision of advance information allows response priming but heightened responses can cause errors (responding too early or reacting to the wrong stimulus). Thus, a balance is required between the online cognitive mechanisms (inhibitory and anticipatory) used to prepare and execute a motor response at the appropriate time. We investigated the use of advance information in 71 participants across four different age groups: (i) children, (ii) young adults, (iii) middle-aged adults, and (iv) older adults. We implemented ‘cued’ and ‘non-cued’ conditions to assess age-related changes in saccadic and touch responses to targets in three movement conditions: (a) Eyes only; (b) Hands only; (c) Eyes and Hand. Children made less saccade errors compared to young adults, but they also exhibited longer response times in cued versus non-cued conditions. In contrast, older adults showed faster responses in cued conditions but exhibited more errors. The results indicate that young adults (18–25 years) achieve an optimal balance between anticipation and execution. In contrast, children show benefits (few errors) and costs (slow responses) of good inhibition when preparing a motor response based on advance information; whilst older adults show the benefits and costs associated with a prospective response strategy (i.e., good anticipation)."
