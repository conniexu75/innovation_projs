https://openalex.org/W2005097199,Bone morphogenetic protein and bone-derived growth factors are biochemical tools for research on induced cell differentiation and local mechanisms controlling cell proliferation. Bone morphogenetic protein irreversibly induces differentiation of perivascular mesenchymal-type cells into osteoprogenitor cells. Bone-derived growth factors are secreted by and for osteoprogenitor cells and stimulate DNA synthesis. Bone generation and regeneration are attributable to the co-efficiency of bone morphogenetic protein and bone-derived growth factors.
https://openalex.org/W2151335002,"When human platelets were stimulated by synthetic diacylglycerol such as 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glycerol, which was a potent activator in vitro of Ca2+-activated, phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) (Mori, T., Takai, Y., Yu, B., Takahashi, J., Nishizuka, Y., and Fujikura, T. (1982) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 91, 427-431), a protein having Mr approximately 40,000 (40-kilodalton protein) was rapidly phosphorylated, just as it was by natural extracellular messengers such as thrombin. Fingerprint analysis appeared to indicate that protein kinase C was indeed responsible for this 40-kilodalton protein phosphorylation in intact platelets. Under these conditions, neither inositol phospholipid breakdown nor endogenous diacylglycerol formation was observed, indicating that the synthetic diacylglycerol intercalated into the membrane and directly activated protein kinase C without interaction with cell surface receptors. During this process, the diacylglycerol was converted in situ to the corresponding phosphatidate, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-glyceryl-3-phosphoric acid. Experiments with the synthetic diacylglycerol and Ca2+ ionophore A23187 suggested that the protein phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinase C was a prerequisite requirement for the release of serotonin, and that the receptor-linked protein phosphorylation and Ca2+ mobilization acted synergistically to elicit the full physiological cellular response."

https://openalex.org/W1614185919,"Biochemical properties of the heat shock or stress proteins of mammalian cells have been investigated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunological techniques. Of the major mammalian stress proteins (Mr = 72,000, 73,000, and 90,000) and minor stress proteins (Mr = 80,000, 100,000, and 110,000), the 80- and 90-kDa proteins were found to be phosphoproteins in all cell types examined. The 100-kDa protein was found to incorporate phosphate in only some cell types examined. In studies of the metabolic incorporation of mannose into the stress proteins, only the 100-kDa protein was found to be a glycoprotein. Two of the stress proteins, the 80- and 100-kDa species, were found to be identical with the proteins induced in cells grown in the absence of glucose (i.e. the glucose-regulated proteins). These same two proteins also were induced in cells treated with the calcium ionophore A23187. To begin examining the intracellular location of these multiregulated proteins, immunofluorescence microscopy studies were carried out using a monoclonal antibody against the 100-kDa stress protein. The antigen was localized primarily with the Golgi apparatus and less prominently with the plasma membrane and nucleus. Heat shock treatment resulted in an increased number of the cells exhibiting a nuclear location of 100 kDa."
https://openalex.org/W2089240756,"During normal development in D. melanogaster, messenger RNAs for three of the seven heat shock proteins (hsp83, hsp28 and hsp26) accumulate in adult ovaries and are abundant in embryos until blastoderm. The three mRNAs appear to originate in nurse cells and subsequently pass, during stages 10â€“11, into the oocyte. Little if any of the four other heat shock mRNAs is present in unshocked ovaries or embryos at any time examined. Pre-blastoderm embryos fail to accumulate these heat shock mRNAs even if subjected to heat shock. The accumulation in normal oogenesis of mRNAs for only three of the seven heat shock proteins indicates the existence of differential, possibly multiple controls of heat shock gene expression, and suggests that heat shock proteins hsp83, hsp28 and hsp26 function in the oocyte or early embryo."
https://openalex.org/W1596523068,"The tissue sites of degradation of apoprotein A-I were determined in the rat in vivo using a newly developed tracer of protein catabolism, an adduct of 125I-tyramine and cellobiose. This methodology takes advantage of the fact that when a protein labeled with 125I-tyramine-cellobiose is taken up and degraded, the radiolabeled ligand remains trapped intracellularly. Thus, radio-iodine accumulation in a tissue acts as a cumulative measure of protein degradation in that tissue. In the present studies, apoprotein AI (apo-A-I) was labeled with tyramine-cellobiose (TC). The TC-labeled apo-A-I was then reassociated with high density lipoprotein (HDL) in vivo by injection into donor animals. After 30 min, serum from donor animals was recovered and then injected into recipient rats. TC-labeled apo-A-I in the donor serum was shown to be exclusively associated with HDL. The fractional catabolic rate of 125I-TC-apo-A-I was not significantly different from that of conventionally labeled apo-A-I. The kidney was the major site of degradation, accounting for 39% of the total. The liver was responsible for 26% of apo-A-I catabolism, 96% of which occurred in hepatocytes. The kidney was also the most active organ of catabolism/g of wet weight. The tissues next most active/g of wet weight were ovary and adrenal, a finding that is compatible with a special role of HDL in the rat for delivery of cholesterol for steroidogenesis. Immunofluorescence studies of frozen sections of rat kidney demonstrated the presence of apo-A-I on the brush-border and in apical granules of proximal tubule epithelial cells. Preliminary studies using HDL labeled both with 125I-TC-apo-A-I and [3H]cholesteryl ethers again demonstrated high rates of renal uptake of apo-A-I but less than 1% of total ether uptake. It is postulated that the high activity of kidney was not due to uptake of intact HDL particles, but rather, due to glomerular filtration and tubular reabsorption of free apo-A-I."

https://openalex.org/W1567023633,"Arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase was isolated from guinea pig peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and partially purified from a high speed supernatant of a homogenate. 5-Hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid was a predominant reaction product. The enzyme reaction required specifically calcium ion (20 microM for half-maximal activity), and other divalent cations such as magnesium and cobalt were ineffective. The calcium-dependent 5-lipoxygenase reaction was stimulated by several nucleotides, most prominently by ATP in the order of 1 mM. 5,8,11,14,17-Eicosapentaenoic acid as substrate was as active as arachidonic acid, and was oxygenated at the C-5 position."
https://openalex.org/W1529402584,"Smooth muscle cells derived from monkey aorta were cultured in medium with [35S]sulfate and [3H]glucosamine as labeling precursors. Proteoglycans in the medium and in 4 M guanidine HCl extracts of the cell layer were purified by DEAE-Sephacel and molecular sieve chromatography. Both preparations contained a predominant, large chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (Kav = 0.30 on Sepharose CL-2B) with glycosaminoglycan chains of Mr approximately 43,000 average containing a ratio of 6-sulfate to 4-sulfate of approximately 2. Approximately 7 and 27% of the 3H label in this proteoglycan were present in N-linked and O-linked oligosaccharides, respectively. Reaggregation experiments indicated that a large proportion of these proteoglycans can form link protein-stabilized aggregates. The medium fraction also contained a smaller dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (Kav = 0.67 on Sepharose CL-2B) with glycosaminoglycan chains of Mr approximately 43,000 containing a ratio of 6-sulfate to 4-sulfate of about 0.5. This proteoglycan contained approximately the same percentage of N-linked oligosaccharides as the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, but few or no O-linked oligosaccharides. A smaller dermatan sulfate proteoglycan with a single chain was present only in the cell layer. Additionally, small amounts of heparan sulfate proteoglycans were synthesized by the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1639651656,"The binding of bovine Factor V, isolated Factor Va, and isolated activation intermediates to single bilayer phospholipid vesicles was studied by light scattering. The vesicles composed of 25% phosphatidylserine and 75% phosphatidylcholine had a mean radius of approximately 163 A as determined by quasi-elastic light scattering. When these vesicles were saturated with Factor V, the radii increased by approximately 120 A in both 0.15 and 1 M NaCl. At saturation, about 35 molecules of Factor V and 141 molecules of Factor Va were bound to each vesicle. Studies of the binding of Factor V and Factor Va at various ionic strengths showed little change in either Kd or n, suggesting that the binding is not electrostatic. The dissociation constants (Kd) and the lipid to protein ratios at saturation, moles/mol (n), obtained by relative light scattering intensities were: Factor V (Kd = 4.3 X 10(-8) M, n = 214); isolated Factor Va (Kd = 1.7 X 10(-7) M, n = 57); component B, Mr = 205,000 (Kd = 1.8 X 10(-7) M, n = 140); component C, Mr = 150,000 (Kd = 7.0 X 10(-7) M, n = 136); component D, Mr = 94,000 (no binding could be demonstrated); component E, Mr = 74,000 (Kd = 3.8 X 10(-7) M, n = 42). The results presented here indicate that the lower Kd exhibited by Factor V compared to Factor Va (components D and E) is primarily due to the interaction present within the component C portion of the molecule which is destroyed when component C is further cleaved to give component D. The interactions responsible for the binding of Factor Va are expressed in component E as well as in its precursor peptide component B. Dissociation of components D and E by the addition of EDTA indicate that component E alone is responsible for the interaction of bovine Factor Va with phospholipid."
https://openalex.org/W1668382251,"The metallochromic indicator arsenazo III was used to study the effect of oxidative stress on ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by rat liver microsomes. Addition of ATP caused a rapid increase in ionophore A23187-releasable Ca2+ which stabilized in 2-3 min and provided a rapid and very sensitive assay for ATP-dependent Ca2+ sequestration. Quantitatively, this fraction was sufficient to account for virtually all of the nonmitochondrial ionophore-releasable Ca2+ of rat hepatocytes. Incubation with t-butyl hydroperoxide caused a rapid loss in the ability of microsomes to sequester Ca2+ in the presence of ATP. Addition of dithiothreitol or a physiological concentration of GSH to these incubations provided effective protection against the oxidative damage. ATP-dependent microsomal Ca2+ sequestration is therefore sensitive to oxidative damage and may be a primary site of injury leading to disturbed Ca2+ homeostasis during the early stages of drug hepatotoxicity. Intracellular thiols, notably GSH, may prevent these changes by protecting the microsomal Ca2+ pump from oxidative damage."

https://openalex.org/W1539674135,"The synthesis of platelet activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) was studied in rabbit peritoneal polymorphonuclear neutrophils. Upon stimulation with ionophore A23187 and Ca2+, these cells are able to incorporate [3H]acetate or 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine into platelet activating factor. Under the same incubation conditions, however, the cells do not synthesize platelet activating factor from [14C]hexadecanol, which is an immediate precursor of O-alkyl chains in the de novo pathway. In the absence of ionophore, [14C] hexadecanol is incorporated into 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate and subsequently into the 1-O-alkyl-linked choline and ethanolamine phosphoglyceride pools. However, in the presence of ionophore, [14C] hexadecanol incorporation is limited to phosphatidic acid, perhaps due to the inhibition of choline phosphotransferase. These findings provide strong evidence that platelet activating factor is synthesized by a deacylation-reacylation mechanism. Upon stimulation, these cells can utilize both plausible substrates of this pathway to make the final product, while under the same conditions it appears that a key step of the de novo pathway is inhibited."
https://openalex.org/W1589885787,"Arachidonic acid and 12-hydroperoxyeicosa-5,8, 10, 14-tetraenoic acid are converted by a 0-30% ammonium sulfate fraction (Fraction A) of the high speed supernatant of rat lung into two hydroxy epoxides (EH-1 and EH-2) which have been purified by high performance liquid chromatography. These hydroxy epoxides are converted quantitatively into two triols (10,11,12- from EH-1 and 8,11,12- from EH-2) by a 30-50% ammonium sulfate fraction (Fraction B) of the high speed supernatant. We propose the structures, 8-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyeicosa-5,9,14-trienoic acid (EH-2) and 10-hydroxy-11,12-epoxyeicosa-5,8,14-trienoic acids (EH-1) for these intermediates on the basis of mass spectral interpretation of several derivatives including the lithium aluminum hydride reduction product of both natural and 18Oxygenated derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2167649192,"We have examined the carbohydrate binding specificity of the B4 lectin from Vicia villosa seeds. The B4 lectin agglutinates Tn-exposed erythrocytes specifically and binds to these erythrocytes (1.4 X 10(6) sites/cell) with an association constant of 4.2 X 10(7) M-1. The concentrations of saccharides and glycopeptides of defined structure which cause 50% inhibition of B4 lectin binding to Tn-exposed erythrocytes were determined. N-Acetylgalactosamine is the best monosaccharide inhibitor, causing 50% inhibition of binding at a concentration of 0.04 mM. Other monosaccharides inhibit lectin binding in the following order of decreasing potency: N-acetylgalactosamine greater than methyl-alpha-galactopyranoside greater than p-nitrophenyl-alpha- or beta-galactopyranoside greater than methyl-beta-galactopyranoside, galactose greater than galactosamine greater than mannose, N-acetylglucosamine. The disaccharide Gal beta 1,3GalNAc causes 50% inhibition of binding at a concentration of 2.8 mM, a concentration similar to that of the p-nitrophenyl-alpha- or beta-galactopyranosides. Glycopeptides containing O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharide units are significantly more potent inhibitors of lectin binding than the oligosaccharide units alone. The most potent glycopeptide inhibitor is a fetuin glycopeptide containing two alpha-linked N-acetylgalactosamine units. This glycopeptide causes 50% inhibition of lectin binding at a concentration of 0.00034 mM and probably closely resembles the B4 lectin binding site on Tn-exposed erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1636104439,"A glycoprotein-enriched fraction derived from 3T3-L1 adipocyte membranes by Triton X-100 extraction and chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose contains an insulin-activable protein kinase that catalyzes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in proteins (Petruzzelli, L. M., Ganguly, S., Smith, C.J., Cobb, M. H., Rubin, C.S., and Rosen, O. M. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 6792-6796). The best peptide substrates for the enzyme are angiotensin II, and a synthetic peptide related to the amino acid sequence surrounding the site of tyrosine phosphorylation in the transforming protein kinase of Rous sarcoma virus. Kinetic analysis of the phosphorylation reaction with angiotensin II showed that insulin decreased the Km from 5.0 to 2.6 mM, and increased the Vmax from 0.6 to 2.2 pmol/min/10 fmol of insulin binding capacity. For the src-related peptide, the addition of insulin decreased the Km from 1.6 to 1.2 mM and increased the Vmax from 0.17 to 2.2 pmol/min/10 fmol of insulin binding capacity. Angiotensin III inhibitor, proctolin, beta-lipotropin (61-65) and Tyr-Arg were poorer substrates for the protein kinase. Protein substrates for the insulin-stimulated protein kinase include anti-src IgG, tubulin, casein, and histone H2b. The data suggest that the substrate specificity of the insulin-activable protein kinase is similar to that reported for the src and epidermal growth factor receptor protein kinases."

https://openalex.org/W1512279465,"Genetic factors controlling the structure of high density lipoproteins (HDL) in mice have been examined. Surveys of inbred strains of mice revealed genetic structural variations of the two major apolipoproteins of mouse HDL, apolipoproteins A-I and A-II. The structural variations alter the charge of the proteins as judged by isoelectric focusing of HDL under denaturing conditions. The structural variations are inherited as single Mendelian genes exhibiting co-dominant expression. The structural gene for mouse apolipoprotein A-II, designated Alp-2, resides on mouse chromosome 1, tightly linked to Ly-m20, a lymphocyte alloantigen locus. Previous studies, as well as our results, suggest that the structural gene for mouse apolipoprotein A-I, designated Alp-1, is on mouse chromosome 9. The genetic structural variation for apo-A-I results in a shift in the charge of the entire family of apo-A-I isoforms, indicating that they are all encoded by a common structural gene. The structure of intact HDL, examined primarily by electrophoretic techniques, exhibits numerous and complex phenotypes among different strains of mice. One variation, controlling the density and possibly the size of HDL, has been studied in two sets of recombinant inbred strains of mice. The results indicate that the variation is controlled by a single major gene that is either tightly linked to or identical with the Alp-2 gene on chromosome 1. In addition to structural variation, inbred strains of mice exhibited considerable quantitative variation of plasma HDL. Thus, the mouse provides a useful model system for examining the genetic control of mammalian HDL structure and regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1488028995,"Monoclonal antibodies against prostaglandin H (PGH) synthase have been used to precipitate cyclooxygenase and peroxidase activities from detergent-solubilized preparations of ram seminal vesicle microsomes. Approximately 85% of the solubilized cyclooxygenase activity was precipitated using an excess of anti-PGH synthase antibody; under similar conditions, immunoprecipitation of 60% of the diphenylisobenzofuran peroxidase, 75% of the phenylbutazone peroxidase, and 50% of the epinephrine peroxidase activities occurred. In contrast, less than 10% of the cyclooxygenase or peroxidase activities could be precipitated with nonimmune, control antibody preparations. These data indicate that the hydroperoxidase activity of PGH synthase is the major peroxidase activity catalyzing the co-oxidation of xenobiotics in ram seminal vesicle microsomes."
https://openalex.org/W1585265298,"Our results demonstrate that the organic hydroperoxide t-butyl-hydroperoxide (TBHP) influences the synthesis of prostaglandins in the human embryo lung fibroblast. TBHP inhibits or stimulates prostaglandin synthesis as a function of its concentration. Regardless of the concentration employed in these experiments however, TBHP stimulated the release of arachidonate from lipid stores. When the arachidonate release step in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis was bypassed by the addition of free arachidonate to the cell cultures, t-butyl hydroperoxide further stimulated PG synthesis, indicating that the hydroperoxide activates arachidonate conversion to prostaglandins. 4-Hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxy radical, a scavenger of oxygen radicals, when added to cell cultures alone had no measurable effect on either arachidonate release or prostaglandin synthesis. When 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxy radical was administered to cell cultures in combination with t-butyl hydroperoxide, it increased prostaglandin synthesis while inhibiting arachidonate release by the hydroperoxide. The participation of hydroperoxides and trappers of oxygen radicals in the regulation of PG synthesis is not unique to lung fibroblasts. Endothelial cells from the vasculature as well as fibroblasts from the cornea also appear to be affected by these compounds with respect to prostaglandin synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1555321622,"Vascular and nonvascular smooth muscles in 12 different organs from the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts of the rabbit, cow, dog, sheep, pig, and rat were examined for prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) synthase immunoreactivity by indirect immunocytofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies against the enzyme. Each of 35 different smooth muscle layers tested stained for the PGI2 synthase antigen except the circular smooth muscle of the rabbit large intestine. Interestingly, PGI2 synthase-positive fluorescent staining of smooth muscle was always observed to be associated with both the nuclear and plasma membranes. Our results indicate that most smooth muscle, both vascular and nonvascular, has the capacity to synthesize PGI2. Moreover, the fact that the PGI2 synthase antigen is associated with at least two different organelles in each cell suggests that there are two independent PGI2-synthesizing systems in smooth muscle; one on the nuclear membrane, and one on the plasma membrane. PGI2 formed at these different sites may subserve different functions within the same cell."

Ser/Thr-linked (O-linked) oligosaccharides were released by alkaline borohydride treatment, and fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography with an anion-exchange resin. The structure of a major oligosaccharide alditol separated by high performance liquid chromatography was investigated by a combination of compositional analyses, methylation and glycosidase treatments, and proposed to be a hexasaccharide alditol, NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-6(NeuAc alpha 2-3Gal beta 1-3) N-acetylgalactosaminitol.

https://openalex.org/W2084711270,"There has been an increasing interest in the use of immobilized cells for the production of pharmaceuticals as well as for products such as high fructose syrup or ethanol. Some of these compounds are now produced on an industrial scale whereby the cells are used in a resting or growing state or in a nonviable form as natural carriers of the enzyme(s) involved in the synthesis. The advantages of immobilized cell technology should also apply to microorganisms modified by recombinant DNA techniques to produce a variety of eukaryotic proteins such as hormones. We describe here the properties of immobilized Bacillus subtilis cells carrying plasmids encoding rat proinsulin. Cell proliferation normally coupled to DNA replication is undesirable in immobilized cell systems as ""clogging' of the system occurs due to cells growing outside the beads. Therefore, different ways were investigated to inhibit cell division while allowing continued protein synthesis. We found that the addition of certain antibiotics in the growth medium, such as novobiocin which inhibits DNA replication, fulfills these requirements, allowing proinsulin synthesis and excretion to take place over a period of several days."

https://openalex.org/W1544302659,"Apart from causing the formation of gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine cross-linked polymers, exposure of human erythrocytes to Ca2+ and ionophore A23187 leads to a breakdown of the two major transmembrane proteins, i.e. the anion-transporting band 3 and glycophorin. This apparently proteolytic phenomenon was examined by crossed immunoelectrophoretic techniques. The main product of the cleavage of band 3 had a chain weight of about 55,000 and showed good precipitation with the antibody raised against the intact protein. The degradation of glycophorin was more rapid and, when complete, gave rise to small fragments which were barely precipitated with antiglycophorin antibody. Incubation of the cells with pepstatin or N-ethylmaleimide prior to and during Ca2+ loading prevented the breakdown of both transmembrane proteins. Histamine, a competitive inhibitor of the transglutaminase-catalyzed formation of gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine cross-links in Ca2+-enriched erythrocytes, also provided some protection, suggesting that the breakdown of the two transmembrane proteins might in some manner be related to the transglutaminase-dependent polymerization process. Pathophysiological implications of the proteolytic event, which would distort the normal interaction of membrane proteins with the cytoskeleton, are discussed."

Three major bands were visualized by fluorography after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the fibroblast proteins. These bands corresponded to pyruvate carboxylase (Mr = 125,000), the biotin-containing subunit of methyl crotonyl-CoA carboxylase (Mr = 75,000) and the biotin-containing subunit of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (Mr = 73,000) as judged by molecular weight markers, purified carboxylase protein standards, and interaction with monospecific antisera. Four out of 5 cell lines from patients with classical pyruvate carboxylase deficiency (less than 5% of normal activity) labeled with this technique displayed a normal band in the position of pyruvate carboxylase while one cell line showed complete absence of any labeled protein in this area. These results demonstrate heterogeneity in the etiology of pyruvate carboxylase deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1579600861,"The binding of EDTA and EGTA to bovine alpha-lactalbumin was shown to stabilize the native conformation relative to that characteristic of the metal-free protein (A conformer). Fluorescence titration of the metal-free protein with Ca2+ in the presence of EDTA was markedly influenced by micromolar concentrations of EDTA such that the apparent association constant of calcium binding would be significantly larger than obtained in the absence of chelator. These observations explain the discrepancy in values of K alpha reported by different investigators for binding near neutral pH: 2.75 X 10(6) M-1 (Kronman, M. J., Sinha, S. K., and Brew, K. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 8582-8586); 6.3 X 10(8) M-1 (Permyakov, E. A., Yarmolenko, V. V., Kalinichemko, L. P., Morozova, L. A., and Burstein, E. A. (1981) Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The last two high values were obtained by fluorescence titration in the presence of EGTA, while the former lower one was determined by a gel filtration technique in the absence of chelators. The anomolous association constants for calcium binding and the alteration of a conformational equilibrium observed in the presence of chelators demonstrate the need for great care in the use of chelating metal ion buffers in the studying of metalloproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2089215810,An 831-base pair segment of the corynebacteriophage beta tox-45 genome encoding fragment A of diphtheria toxin was cloned into plasmid pUC8 in Escherichia coli K12. Strains containing recombinant plasmids expressed the adenosine diphosphate ribosyl transferase activity characteristic of fragment A; this activity could be inhibited by polyvalent antiserum to fragment A as well as by the appropriate monoclonal antibodies to diphtheria toxin. The transferase activity was secreted into the periplasmic space of E. coli. These findings have implications for the future construction of genetically engineered chimeric toxins.
https://openalex.org/W1937650685,"Evidence was obtained for tight association of DNA primase activity with a subspecies of mouse DNA polymerase alpha by study with immunoadsorption assay using two monoclonal antibodies specific for human DNA polymerase alpha that have been shown to react with mouse murine myeloma DNA polymerase alpha (Tanaka, S., Hu, S.-Z., Wang, T.-S.-F. & Korn, D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 8386-8390). This result was supported by the finding that ethidium bromide at concentrations of less than 20 microM somewhat stimulated the syntheses of DNA and initiator RNA on unprimed poly(dT) by the novel subspecies of DNA polymerase alpha, but strongly inhibited DNA synthesis with poly(dT) X oligo(rA), suggesting that the conversion of synthesis from initiator RNA to DNA is continuous. Furthermore, the results of neutralization assay with the antibodies and experiment using aphidicolin suggested that the primase site is functionally distinguishable from the catalytic site of DNA polymerase activity."
https://openalex.org/W188370024,"The present work shows that chick breast muscles synthesize and secrete a protein which is very similar to chicken serum apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-A1), the major protein constituent of serum density lipoprotein particles. This conclusion is based on the following observations. 1) When chick breast muscle explants were incubated in the presence of radioactive amino acids, a labeled protein of the same size as serum Apo-A1 (Mr approximately equal to 27,000) accumulated in the incubation media; 2) the muscle-derived secretory protein and serum Apo-A1 generated the same size distribution of peptide fragments following digestion with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease; and 3) antibodies raised against serum Apo-A1 specifically precipitated the radioactive muscle secretory protein. The newly secreted muscle-derived Apo-A1 was associated with lipid, as judged by its flotation behavior during centrifugation of the labeled incubation media in the presence of 0.2 g/ml of sodium bromide; this observation suggests that muscle explants secreted Apo-A1 molecules as part of lipoprotein particles or that these Apo-A1 molecules became associated with lipid shortly after their secretion. The present work, together with the very recent report by Blue et al. (Blue, M.L., Ostapchuk, P., Gordon, J.S., and Williams, D.L. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11151-11159) demonstrate that avian tissues other than liver and intestinal mucosa synthesize and secrete Apo-A1. Results of short term amino acid incorporation experiments showed that chick breast muscles synthesize Apo-A1 at high rates only during the terminal stages of embryonic development and early stages of postembryonic maturation. Around the time of hatching, the relative rate of synthesis of Apo-A1 by chick breast muscle was found to be higher than in liver, a documented major site of synthesis of this apolipoprotein. Possible physiological implications of the present work will be considered."

The purification includes sequential affinity chromatography on blue-Sepharose and a thymidine column. The molecular weight of the enzyme determined by gel filtration and sucrose density ultracentrifugation is 92,000. The subunit molecular weight is 44,000, suggesting that the enzyme is a dimer in its native state. With isoelectric focusing, placental thymidine kinase demonstrated a single form with an isoelectric point of 9.1. The final purified enzyme preparation exhibits no immunological cross-reactivity with human mitochondrial thymidine kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1602766123,"2,3-Butanedione inactivates the pure form of UDP-glucuronyltransferase used in these experiments (GT2P) (EC 2.4.1.17) purified from pig liver microsomes. The kinetics of the reaction indicates that 2,3-butanedione reacts with two amino acids that affect activity. A rapid, partial inactivation is followed by a slower rate of inactivation that leads eventually to completely inactive enzyme. UDP-glucuronic acid and glucuronic acid, as compared with UDP, are effective as protectors against the slow, secondary phase of inactivation; no ligand tested protected against the rapid phase of inactivation. The lipid environment of GT2P was a determinant of the pseudo-first order rate constant for the slow phase of inactivation, but did not affect the rate of the rapid phase of inactivation. The data suggest that GT2P contains an active site arginine that interacts with the -COO- at C-6 of the glucuronic acid moiety of UDP-glucuronic acid."
https://openalex.org/W85293829,"Benzphetamine demethylase and aniline hydroxylase activities were determined with various hemoproteins including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in a cytochrome P-450-like reconstituted system containing NADPH, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, and O2. The highest specific activities, almost comparable to those of liver microsomal cytochrome P-450, were detected with indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase from the rabbit intestine. The indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-catalyzed benzphetamine demethylation reaction was inhibited by catalase but not by superoxide dismutase. Exogenous H2O2 or organic hydroperoxides was able to replace the reducing system and O2. The stoichiometry of H2O2 added to the product formed was essentially unity. These results indicate that the dioxygenase catalyzes the demethylation reaction by the so-called peroxygenation mechanism using H2O2 generated in the reconstituted system. On the other hand, the dioxygenase-catalyzed aniline hydroxylation reaction was not only completely inhibited by catalase but also suppressed by superoxide dismutase by about 60%. Although the O2- and H2O2-generating system (e.g. hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase) was also active as the reducing system, neither exogenous H2O2 nor the generation of O2- in the presence of catalase supported the hydroxylation reaction, indicating that both H2O2 and O2- were essential for the hydroxylation reaction. However, typical scavengers for hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen were not inhibitory. These results suggest that a unique, as yet unidentified active oxygen species generated by H2O2 and O2- participates in the dioxygenase-mediated aniline hydroxylation reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1539347517,"Oral administration of triacetyloleandomycin (TAO), 1 mmol/kg/day for 7 days to mature male New Zealand White rabbit results in a significant increase in the content of liver microsomal cytochrome P-450. This increase is accompanied by the occurrence on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the microsomes of a strong band in the zone of electrophoretic mobility associated with the LM3 isozymes and the stimulation of a number of monooxygenase activities of these microsomes including aminopyrine, chlorcyclizine, TAO, and erythromycin demethylation as well as 2-OH-estradiol and 6 beta OH-testosterone hydroxylation. Cytochrome P-450 LM3 (TAO) from these liver microsomes, purified to electrophoretic homogeneity, had Mr = 52,000 as determined by calibrated sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Comparison with isozymes LM3a, LM3b, and LM3c isolated from control animals, by a number of criteria including spectral data, amino acid content, NH2-terminal sequence analysis, peptide mapping, immunological properties, and monooxygenase activities of reconstituted system, indicated that isozymes LM3 (TAO) and LM3b are very similar, if not identical, proteins. We conclude that TAO must be considered as a new type of inducer of microsomal cytochrome P-450 from rabbit liver."
https://openalex.org/W1490111500,"Steady state kinetic parameters (kcat and Km) which were determined for the D-serine dehydratase-catalyzed decomposition of the isomers of serine and threonine at pH 5.7, 7.8, and 8.9 indicated that the enzyme exhibited considerable kinetic specificity. At pH 7.8 and 25 degrees C, the specificity constants (kcat/Km) were as follows: D-serine (3.4 X 10(5) M-1 s-1), D-threonine (2.9 X 10(4) M-1 s-1), D-allothreonine (7.5 X 10(3) M-1 s-1), and L-serine (38 M-1 s-1). Substrate C-2 deuterium atom isotope effects on the steady state kinetic parameters disclosed that the rate-determining step in the catalytic pathway varied with substrate structure and pH. Removal of the C-2 hydrogen atom of the substrate was shown to be fully rate-determining with L-serine and partially rate-determining with D-allothreonine as substrate at pH 7.8. Stopped flow measurements of absorbance and fluorescence were used to characterize intermediates in the catalytic pathway. These measurements indicated that D-serine, in addition to being the best substrate, was processed faster than the other substrates through steps in the catalytic pathway which were not rate-controlling. Kinetic evidence also was obtained which indicated that the base which accepts the proton from the C-2 carbon atom of the substrate must be aprotic. Thus, the catalytic site of D-serine dehydratase should contain a basic group in addition to the active site lysyl residue."

https://openalex.org/W1648430573,"Purified hepatic NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase, which was reconstituted with dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, catalyzed a one-electron reductive denitrosation of 1-(2-[14C]-chloroethyl)-3-(cyclohexyl)-1-nitrosourea ([14C]CCNU) to give 1-(2-[14C]-chloroethyl)-3-(cyclohexyl)urea at the expense of NADPH. Ambient oxygen or anoxic conditions did not alter the rates of [14C]CCNU denitrosation catalyzed by NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase with NADPH. Electron equivalents for reduction could be supplied by NADPH or sodium dithionite. However, the turnover number with NADPH was slightly greater than with sodium dithionite. Enzymatic denitrosation with sodium dithionite or NADPH was observed in anaerobic incubation mixtures which contained NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase with or without cytochrome P-450 purified from livers of phenobarbital (PB)-treated rats; PB cytochrome P-450 alone did not support catalysis. PB cytochrome P-450 stimulated reductase activity at molar concentrations approximately equal to or less than NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase concentration, but PB cytochrome P-450 concentrations greater than NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase inhibited catalytic denitrosation. Cytochrome c, FMN, and riboflavin demonstrated different degrees of stimulation of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase-dependent denitrosation. Of the flavins tested, FMN demonstrated greater stimulation than riboflavin and FAD had no observable effect. A 3-fold stimulation by FMN was not observed in the absence of NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. These studies provided evidence which establish NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase rather than PB cytochrome P-450 as the enzyme in the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum responsible for CCNU reductive metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1595883618,"Abstract Two vitamin B6 derivatives, N-bromoacetylpyridoxamine (BAPM) and its phosphate ester have been found to be affinity-labeling reagents for mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase (EC 2.6.1.1). These derivatives were first shown to react with a critical sulfhydryl group in tryptophan synthase (Higgins, W., and Miles, E. W. (1978) J. Biol. Chem. 253, 4648-4652). In the apoaminotransferase, BAPM has now been found to inactivate by covalently modifying a critical lysyl residue, preventing reconstitution of the apoenzyme by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. The dependence of the rate of inactivation upon the concentration of the reagent is consistent with a rapid equilibrium binary complex formation prior to the inactivation reaction. Both the dissociation constant for this complex and the rate of the reaction leading to inactivation are dependent on pH. BAPM binds best from pH 7.5 to 8.5. The rate of inactivation increases from pH 6 to 9. Succinate and phosphate competitively bind to the apoenzyme, protecting against BAPM inactivation. The C-5'-phosphorylated derivative is rapidly and tightly bound by the apotransaminase to form an inactive, noncovalent adduct. This bound reagent subsequently alkylates Lys-258. The rate of this covalent incorporation increases from pH 6 to 9 and is greater than the rate of BAPM modification at all pH values. The effect of pH on the reaction rates of both pyridoxal derivatives is interpreted to indicate protonation of Lys-258 at neutral pH values. These derivatives may also be analogs to a reaction intermediate different from those observed in other affinity-labeling studies. The ionization states of the Lys-258 epsilon-amino group apparently vary with the nature of the affinity label. These variations can be explained in terms of changing ionization states of Lys-258 in the steps of catalysis as well as in terms of the occupancy of charged sites on the protein by active site-directed substrates or inhibitory compounds."
https://openalex.org/W22403693,"Hereditary nephritis protein (HNP), an unusual urine protein from patients with hereditary nephritis (Alport Syndrome), was purified 120-fold to homogeneity. A slightly larger protein, pro-HNP, was similarly purified and was found to be a precursor of HNP. Both pro-HNP and HNP showed immunological identity to the third component of human complement, C3, and to its catabolite C3c. Pro-HNP had a molecular weight of 143,000 and, in equimolar ratio, polypeptide chains or fragments of molecular weights 75,000, 40,000, and 28,000. The largest and smallest chains contained carbohydrate. HNP had a molecular weight of 141,000 and fragments of molecular weights 60,000, 38,000, 26,000, and 17,000 in equimolar ratio; the two smallest fragments contained carbohydrate. Plasmin digestion of pro-HNP showed that the 75,000-Da chain, identical with the intact beta-chain of C3, broke down to the 60,000- and 17,000-Da fragments of HNP. In both pro-HNP and HNP, the polypeptide chains were linked by disulfide bonds, with the exception of the 17,000-Da fragment of HNP. This fragment was readily dissociated from the rest of the HNP molecule in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Amino acid analyses showed that both pro-HNP and HNP contained approximately 22 half-cystine residues per molecule. Extinction coefficients, epsilon 1% 1cm, at 280 nm were calculated to be 8.5 and 8.8 for pro-HNP and HNP, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2070225991,"Male hybrids from a cross between female mice of strain C57BL/6Kh and males of strain DBA/2J lived longer after injection of P815 mastocytoma cells of DBA/2 origin than did their female siblings. Responses to the histocompatibility antigen on the X chromosome of the DBA/2 strain may be involved in resistance to the tumor. When the female parent was replaced with a C57BL/6Kh carrying one of several mutations in the H-2 region, this sex effect disappeared in some of the hybrid combinations. Thus, the H-2 complex appears to be involved in the regulation of the immune response to the X-linked histocompatibility antigen in this tumor model."
