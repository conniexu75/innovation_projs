https://openalex.org/W2037786814,"Messenger RNA lacking stop codons ('non-stop mRNA') can arise from errors in gene expression, and encode aberrant proteins whose accumulation could be deleterious to cellular function. In bacteria, these 'non-stop proteins' become co-translationally tagged with a peptide encoded by ssrA/tmRNA (transfer-messenger RNA), which signals their degradation by energy-dependent proteases. How eukaryotic cells eliminate non-stop proteins has remained unknown. Here we show that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ltn1 RING-domain-type E3 ubiquitin ligase acts in the quality control of non-stop proteins, in a process that is mechanistically distinct but conceptually analogous to that performed by ssrA: Ltn1 is predominantly associated with ribosomes, and it marks nascent non-stop proteins with ubiquitin to signal their proteasomal degradation. Ltn1-mediated ubiquitylation of non-stop proteins seems to be triggered by their stalling in ribosomes on translation through the poly(A) tail. The biological relevance of this process is underscored by the finding that loss of Ltn1 function confers sensitivity to stress caused by increased non-stop protein production. We speculate that defective protein quality control may underlie the neurodegenerative phenotype that results from mutation of the mouse Ltn1 homologue Listerin."

However, the molecular mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Here we show that in liver the activity of PARP-1, an NAD(+)-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase, oscillates in a daily manner and is regulated by feeding. We provide biochemical evidence that PARP-1 binds and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ates CLOCK at the beginning of the light phase. The loss of PARP-1 enhances the binding of CLOCK-BMAL1 to DNA and leads to a phase-shift of the interaction of CLOCK-BMAL1 with PER and CRY repressor proteins. As a consequence, CLOCK-BMAL1-dependent gene expression is altered in PARP-1-deficient mice, in particular in response to changes in feeding times. Our results show that Parp-1 knockout mice exhibit impaired food entrainment of peripheral circadian clocks and support a role for PARP-1 in connecting feeding with the mammalian timing system."

Dendritic spines undergo actin-based growth and shrinkage during synaptic plasticity, in which the actin depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family of actin-associated proteins are important. Elevated ADF/cofilin activities often lead to reduced spine size and immature spine morphology but can also enhance synaptic potentiation in some cases. Thus, ADF/cofilin may have distinct effects on postsynaptic structure and function. We found that ADF/cofilin-mediated actin dynamics regulated AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking during synaptic potentiation, which was distinct from actin's structural role in spine morphology. Specifically, elevated ADF/cofilin activity markedly enhanced surface addition of AMPARs after chemically induced long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas inhibition of ADF/cofilin abolished AMPAR addition. We found that chemically induced LTP elicited a temporal sequence of ADF/cofilin dephosphorylation and phosphorylation that underlies AMPAR trafficking and spine enlargement. These findings suggest that temporally regulated ADF/cofilin activities function in postsynaptic modifications of receptor number and spine size during synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2022562381,"Two classes of kinases, CDK and DDK, facilitate the initiation of DNA replication in S phase. In two studies, the Diffley and Toczyski labs show that when damage is sensed, another kinase — the checkpoint kinase Rad53 — halts replication by inhibiting both the CDK and DDK pathways through the phosphorylation of Sld3 and Dbf4, respectively. These results reveal that regulation of the firing of origins is the means by which the intra-S checkpoint slows S phase. Two classes of enzyme — cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) — facilitate the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes. It is now shown that, when DNA damage is sensed, another kinase, Rad53, halts the firing of late replication origins by inhibiting both the CDK and the DDK pathways. Rad53 acts on DDK directly by inhibiting Dbf4, whereas the CDK pathway is blocked by Rad53-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream CDK substrate Sld3. The initiation of eukaryotic DNA replication is regulated by three protein kinase classes: cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) and the DNA damage checkpoint kinases1. CDK phosphorylation of two key initiation factors, Sld2 and Sld3, promotes essential interactions with Dpb11 (refs 2–4), whereas DDK acts by phosphorylating subunits of the Mcm2-7 helicase5. CDK has an additional role in replication by preventing the re-loading of Mcm2-7 during the S, G2 and M phases6, thus preventing origin re-firing and re-replication. During the G1 phase, both CDK and DDK are downregulated, which allows origin licensing and prevents premature replication initiation3. Origin firing is also inhibited during the S phase when DNA damage or replication fork stalling activates the checkpoint kinases7,8,9,10. Here we show that, analogous to the situation in the G1 phase, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae checkpoint kinase Rad53 inhibits both CDK- and DDK-dependent pathways, which acts redundantly to block further origin firing. Rad53 acts on DDK directly by phosphorylating Dbf4, whereas the CDK pathway is blocked by Rad53-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream CDK substrate, Sld3. This allows CDK to remain active during the S phase in the presence of DNA damage, which is crucial to prevent re-loading of Mcm2-7 onto origins that have already fired6. Our results explain how checkpoints regulate origin firing and demonstrate that the slowing of S phase by the ‘intra-S checkpoint’ is primarily due to the inhibition of origin firing."
https://openalex.org/W1990204447,"To better understand the mechanisms that regulate stem cell identity and function, we sought to identify genes that are preferentially expressed by stem cells and critical for their function in multiple tissues. Prdm16 is a transcription factor that regulates leukaemogenesis, palatogenesis and brown-fat development, but which was not known to be required for stem cell function. We demonstrate that Prdm16 is preferentially expressed by stem cells throughout the nervous and haematopoietic systems and is required for their maintenance. In the haematopoietic and nervous systems, Prdm16 deficiency led to changes in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), depletion of stem cells, increased cell death and altered cell-cycle distribution. In neural stem/progenitor cells, Prdm16 binds to the Hgf promoter, and Hgf expression declined in the absence of Prdm16. Addition of recombinant HGF to Prdm16-deficient neural stem cells in cell culture reduced the depletion of these cells and partially rescued the increase in ROS levels. Administration of the anti-oxidant, N-acetyl-cysteine, to Prdm16-deficient mice partially rescued defects in neural stem/progenitor cell function and neural development. Prdm16 therefore promotes stem cell maintenance in multiple tissues, partly by modulating oxidative stress."

https://openalex.org/W2154099646,"Proprioceptive sensory signals inform the CNS of the consequences of motor acts, but effective motor planning involves internal neural systems capable of anticipating actual sensory feedback. Just where and how predictive systems exert their influence remains poorly understood. We explored the possibility that spinocerebellar neurons that convey proprioceptive sensory information also integrate information from cortical command systems. Analysis of the circuitry and physiology of identified dorsal spinocerebellar tract neurons in mouse spinal cord revealed distinct populations of Clarke's column neurons that received direct excitatory and/or indirect inhibitory inputs from descending corticospinal axons. The convergence of these descending inhibitory and excitatory inputs to Clarke's column neurons established local spinal circuits with the capacity to mark or modulate incoming proprioceptive input. Together, our genetic, anatomical and physiological results indicate that Clarke's column spinocerebellar neurons nucleate local spinal corollary circuits that are relevant to motor planning and evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W2157382059,"The angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3) is an important inhibitor of the endothelial and lipoprotein lipases and a promising drug target. ANGPTL3 undergoes proprotein convertase processing (RAPR(224)↓TT) for activation, and the processing site contains two potential GalNAc O-glycosylation sites immediately C-terminal (TT(226)). We developed an in vivo model system in CHO ldlD cells that was used to show that O-glycosylation in the processing site blocked processing of ANGPTL3. Genome-wide SNP association studies have identified the polypeptide GalNAc-transferase gene, GALNT2, as a candidate gene for low HDL and high triglyceride blood levels. We hypothesized that the GalNAc-T2 transferase performed critical O-glycosylation of proteins involved in lipid metabolism. Screening of a panel of proteins known to affect lipid metabolism for potential sites glycosylated by GalNAc-T2 led to identification of Thr(226) adjacent to the proprotein convertase processing site in ANGPTL3. We demonstrated that GalNAc-T2 glycosylation of Thr(226) in a peptide with the RAPR(224)↓TT processing site blocks in vitro furin cleavage. The study demonstrates that ANGPTL3 activation is modulated by O-glycosylation and that this step is probably controlled by GalNAc-T2."
https://openalex.org/W2024307523,"Oxidative stress plays an important role in alcohol-induced inflammation and liver injury. Relatively less is known about how Kupffer cells respond to oxidative stress-induced expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) to blunt inflammation and liver injury. We showed that Kupffer cells from ethanol-fed rats and ethanol-treated rat Kupffer cells and THP-1 cells displayed increased mRNA expression of HO-1, NQO1, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Our studies showed that silencing with HIF-1α and JNK-1 siRNAs attenuated ethanol-mediated mRNA expression of HO-1, but not NQO1, whereas Nrf2 siRNA attenuated the mRNA expression of both HO-1 and NQO1. Additionally, JunD but not JunB formed an activator protein-1 (AP-1) oligomeric complex to augment HO-1 promoter activity. Ethanol-induced HO-1 transcription involved antioxidant response elements, hypoxia-response elements, and an AP-1 binding motif in its promoter, as demonstrated by mutation analysis of the promoter, EMSA, and ChIP. Furthermore, livers of ethanol-fed c-Jun(fl/fl) mice showed reduced levels of mRNA for HO-1 but not of NQO1 compared with ethanol-fed control rats, supporting the role of c-Jun or the AP-1 transcriptional complex in ethanol-induced HO-1 expression. Additionally, attenuation of HO-1 levels in ethanol-fed c-Jun(fl/fl) mice led to increased proinflammatory cytokine expression in the liver. These results for the first time show that ethanol regulates HO-1 and NQO1 transcription by different signaling pathways. Additionally, up-regulation of HO-1 protects the liver from excessive formation of inflammatory cytokines. These studies provide novel therapeutic targets to ameliorate alcohol induced inflammation and liver injury."
https://openalex.org/W2060130496,"It is conceivable that stimulating proteasome activity for rapid removal of misfolded and oxidized proteins is a promising strategy to prevent and alleviate aging-related diseases. Sulforaphane (SFN), an effective cancer preventive agent derived from cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to enhance proteasome activities in mammalian cells and to reduce the level of oxidized proteins and amyloid β-induced cytotoxicity. Here, we report that SFN activates heat shock transcription factor 1-mediated heat shock response. Specifically, SFN-induced expression of heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) underlies SFN-stimulated proteasome activity. SFN-induced proteasome activity was significantly enhanced in Hsp27-overexpressing cells but absent in Hsp27-silenced cells. The role of Hsp27 in regulating proteasome activity was further confirmed in isogenic REG cells, in which SFN-induced proteasome activation was only observed in cells stably overexpressing Hsp27, but not in the Hsp27-free parental cells. Finally, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of Hsp27 is irrelevant to SFN-induced proteasome activation. This study provides a novel mechanism underlying SFN-induced proteasome activity. This is the first report to show that heat shock response by SFN, in addition to the antioxidant response mediated by the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, may contribute to cytoprotection."
https://openalex.org/W1971338943,"The immune system is complex, with multiple layers of regulation that serve to prevent the production of self-antigens. One layer of regulation involves regulatory T cells (Tregs) that play an essential role in maintaining peripheral self-tolerance. Patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis have decreased levels of HDL, suggesting that apoA-I concentrations may be important in preventing autoimmunity and the loss of self-tolerance. In published studies, hypercholesterolemic mice lacking HDL apoA-I or LDLr−/−, apoA-I−/− (DKO), exhibit characteristics of autoimmunity in response to an atherogenic diet. This phenotype is characterized by enlarged cholesterol-enriched lymph nodes (LNs), as well as increased T cell activation, proliferation, and the production of autoantibodies in plasma. In this study, we investigated whether treatment of mice with lipid-free apoA-I could attenuate the autoimmune phenotype. To do this, DKO mice were first fed an atherogenic diet containing 0.1% cholesterol, 10% fat for 6 weeks, after which treatment with apoA-I was begun. Subcutaneous injections of 500 μg of lipid-free apoA-I was administered every 48 h during the treatment phase. These and control mice were maintained for an additional 6 weeks on the diet. At the end of the 12-week study, DKO mice showed decreased numbers of LN immune cells, whereas Tregs were proportionately increased. Accompanying this increase in Tregs was a decrease in the percentage of effector/effector memory T cells. Furthermore, lipid accumulation in LN and skin was reduced. These results suggest that treatment with apoA-I reduces inflammation in DKO mice by augmenting the effectiveness of the LN Treg response.

IntroductionIncreased concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in plasma are a well established negative risk factor for coronary heart disease (1Gordon T. Castelli W.P. Hjortland M.C. Kannel W.B. Dawber T.R. Am. J. Med. 1977; 62: 707-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4053) Google Scholar). ApoA-I is the major protein contained in HDL, and it is essential for its formation and function (2Zannis V.I. Chroni A. Krieger M. J. Mol. Med. 2006; 84: 276-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), as well as associated anti-inflammatory properties (3Zhang Y. Zanotti I. Reilly M.P. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. Rader D.J.

Decreased concentrations of HDL apoA-I are associated not only with increased atherosclerosis but also with autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis (6Bresnihan B.

Although the effects of HDL on atherosclerosis have been widely reported, its effects on autoimmunity are not well understood. Recent studies from our laboratory indicate that in hypercholesterolemic mice lacking plasma apoA-I, an increased susceptibility to autoimmunity exists.

This raises the possibility that HDL apoA-I may be a common link between autoimmunity, inflammation, and atherosclerosis.Therefore, to test whether treatment with lipid-free apoA-I could attenuate ongoing inflammation, DKO mice were first fed an atherogenic diet containing 0.1% cholesterol, 10% fat for 6 weeks, after which treatment with apoA-I was begun. Subcutaneous injections of 500 μg of lipid-free apoA-I was administered every 48 h during the treatment phase. These and control mice were maintained for an additional 6 weeks on diet. At the end of the 12-week study, DKO mice showed decreased numbers of LN immune cells, whereas Tregs were proportionately increased. Accompanying this increase in Treg cell number was a decrease in the percentage of effector/effector memory T cells as well as a reduction in the amount of lipid accumulation in LN and skin. Overall, these results suggest that treatment with apoA-I reduced inflammation and the accompanying autoimmune phenotype by restoring the effectiveness of the LN Treg response.DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that the administration of lipid-free human apoA-I reduces inflammation and cholesterol accumulation in the skin and skin-draining LN of diet-fed male DKO mice. These conclusions were based on the findings that subcutaneous injections of apoA-I decreased cholesterol accumulation as well as the activation state of immune cells in LNs. In addition, in response to apoA-I treatment, there was a large decrease in skin cholesterol and an increase in triglyceride content accompanied by decreased cellularity and the restoration of skin architecture, morphology, and composition. Most importantly, a significant increase in the LN Tregs population was associated with a decrease in LN effector/effector-memory cells and an improved Treg/Teff ratio as well as a reduction in the activation state and proliferative response of the T cells. Taken together, these results suggest that treatment with human apoA-I reduced inflammation within the skin and LNs, possibly through an increased Treg response.The importance of Tregs in modulating T cell responses is of great significance because the immune system is complex, with multiple levels of regulation in place to prevent reaction against self. Tregs maintain peripheral self-tolerance by suppressing activation of T cells (28Gotsman I. Sharpe A.H. Lichtman A.H. Circ. Res. 2008; 103: 1220-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, Tregs can act on dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells by inducing apoptosis or by inhibiting their function (29André S. Tough D.F. Lacroix-Desmazes S. Kaveri S.V. Bayry J. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 174: 1575-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Tregs exert their inhibitory effects by either a contact-dependent process or by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β (29André S. Tough D.F. Lacroix-Desmazes S. Kaveri S.V.

Hematol. 2009; 16: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Although Tregs have the ability to suppress other cells, it is known that under chronic inflammatory conditions both effector cells and antigen-presenting cells can become resistant to Treg suppression and produce cytokines that inhibit Treg function (29André S. Tough D.F. Lacroix-Desmazes S. Kaveri S.V. Bayry J. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 174: 1575-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 32Walker L.S. Immunology. 2009; 126: 466-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, targeting of pathways to inhibit the inflammatory response is a potential therapeutic approach that may result in improved Treg function (29André S. Tough D.F. Lacroix-Desmazes S. Kaveri S.V. Bayry J. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 174: 1575-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). It is important, however, to maintain a balance between Treg and effector cells because, although a deficiency of Tregs can result in severe autoimmune disease (33Dejaco C. Duftner C. Grubeck-Loebenstein B. Schirmer M. Immunology. 2006; 117: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 34Wildin R.S. Smyk-Pearson S. Filipovich A.H. J. Med.

Grubeck-Loebenstein B. Schirmer M. Immunology. 2006; 117: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).Previous studies from our laboratory indicate that the lack of cholesterol efflux in DKO mice was responsible for inflammation in the skin and LNs and the autoimmune phenotype (8Zabalawi M.

Could treatment with human lipid-free apoA-I reverse inflammation and autoimmunity in DKO mice? Given that cholesterol accumulation in DKO mice begins as early as 4 weeks on the diet (8Zabalawi M. Bharadwaj M. Horton H. Cline M. Willingham M. Thomas M.J. Sorci-Thomas M.G. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 52-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Zabalawi M. Bhat S.

Pathol. 2003; 163: 1201-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we chose to start apoA-I injections after mice had been on the diet for 6 weeks, a time point where the cascade of inflammation and cholesterol accumulation has already begun. As expected, injection of human apoA-I resulted in the formation of HDL.With HDL apoA-I injections, male DKO mice exhibited reduced infiltrates and inflammation in skin and LNs, including a decrease in LN-activated T cells. These effects have not been demonstrated in female diet-fed DKO mice. We speculate that this was due to both the anti-inflammatory properties of HDL apoA-I and the restoration of cellular cholesterol efflux. These beneficial effects may be due in part to direct effects of apoA-I on cellular function as apoA-I has been shown to inhibit the contact-mediated activation of monocytes by stimulated T cells (46Hyka N. Dayer J.M. Modoux C. Kohno T. Edwards 3rd, C.K. Roux-Lombard P. Burger D. Blood. 2001; 97: 2381-2389Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 47Wang L. Chen W.Z. Wu M.P. Cytokine. 2010; 49: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). ApoA-I of HDL has been shown to reduce the monocyte inflammatory response (48Murphy A.J. Woollard K.J. Hoang A. Mukhamedova N. Stirzaker R.A. McCormick S.P. Remaley A.T. Sviridov D. Chin-Dusting J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 2071-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Interestingly, when ABCA1 was blocked, the beneficial effect of apoA-I was also blocked, suggesting that cholesterol efflux is essential for this mechanism (48Murphy A.J. Woollard K.J. Hoang A. Mukhamedova N. Stirzaker R.A. McCormick S.P. Remaley A.T. Sviridov D. Chin-Dusting J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 2071-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Thus, cholesterol efflux to apoA-I plays an important role in maintaining both cholesterol and immune system homeostasis.With cholesterol efflux restored in DKO + A-I mice, cholesterol along with macrophage and DC cell infiltrates were removed from the skin, resulting in an overall reversal of inflammation. This is significant given that skin cholesterol accumulation can prove to be fatal for DKO mice (8Zabalawi M. Bharadwaj M. Horton H. Cline M. Willingham M. Thomas M.J. Sorci-Thomas M.G. J. Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 52-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 9Zabalawi M. Bhat S. Loughlin T. Thomas M.J. Alexander E. Cline M. Bullock B. Willingham M. Sorci-Thomas M.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1201-1213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We speculate that cholesterol efflux and the presence of apoA-I reduced cellular activation and inflammation in the skin, allowing for this restoration of skin structure. Importantly, two potentially inflammatory cell types, macrophages and DCs, were reduced in the skin. The decrease in DCs and macrophages in the skin was accompanied by a trend toward increases in both of these cell populations in the LNs, suggesting that these cells may have migrated from the skin to the LNs. This would agree with results from previous studies that indicated that HDL restored migration of DCs from the skin to LNs in hypercholesterolemic mice (49Angeli V. Llodrá J. Rong J.X. Satoh K. Ishii S. Shimizu T. Fisher E.A. Randolph G.J. Immunity. 2004; 21: 561-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In hypercholesterolemic apoE−/− mice, the DCs that are in the skin are activated, and their inability to migrate back to the LNs results in poor immunologic priming and contributes to local inflammation in the skin (49Angeli V. Llodrá J. Rong J.X. Satoh K. Ishii S. Shimizu T. Fisher E.A. Randolph G.J. Immunity. 2004; 21: 561-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It is possible that impaired migration of activated DCs from the periphery may aid in exacerbating memory responses to the periphery (49Angeli V. Llodrá J. Rong J.X. Satoh K. Ishii S. Shimizu T. Fisher E.A. Randolph G.J. Immunity. 2004; 21: 561-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). By helping maintain normal DC migration, HDL supports a healthy protective immune response.Following treatment with apoA-I, the total cholesterol in LNs was reduced compared with DKO mice. This reduction in cholesterol is significant given that an environment with increased cholesterol can lead to increased T cell proliferation (50Armstrong A.J. Gebre A.K. Parks J.S. Hedrick C.C. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, a reduction in the total LN cell number was seen in DKO + A-I mice compared with DKO mice; however, this was not different from 6-week diet-fed DKO. This suggests that apoA-I treatment did not reverse the cellular accumulation in LNs but rather served to arrest the accumulation and proliferation. It is also possible, however, that the LN cells are involved in cholesterol removal from the skin, with lymphocytes constantly moving from the skin to the LNs, and that the number would be further reduced if the treatment period had been extended to the point where the skin cholesterol accumulation was completely reversed. Nevertheless, the reduction in cells, especially activated T cells, in the LNs demonstrates an important effect of apoA-I treatment on the LNs, where immune responses are stimulated.Tregs are an important component of the immune response, acting to maintain self-tolerance. The absence of or defects in Treg can lead to severe autoimmune disorders (29André S. Tough D.F. Lacroix-Desmazes S. Kaveri S.V. Bayry J. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 174: 1575-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Dejaco C. Duftner C. Grubeck-Loebenstein B. Schirmer M.

Science. 2003; 299: 1057-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Despite the autoimmune phenotype in diet-fed DKO mice, Tregs were increased in LNs. This is similar to findings from previous studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, where Tregs were increased in synovial fluid of inflamed joints (52Monte K. Wilson C. Shih F.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 3730-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 53Cao D. van Vollenhoven R. Klareskog L. Trollmo C. Malmström V. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2004; 6: R335-R346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The increase of Treg in tissue suggests that Tregs are homing to sites of inflammation. The correlation between Treg levels in peripheral blood and disease activity is not clear, as some studies have reported increased Tregs in blood, and others show no difference or decreased Tregs compared with healthy patients (33Dejaco C. Duftner C. Grubeck-Loebenstein B. Schirmer M. Immunology. 2006; 117: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 54Crispin J.C. Martínez A. Alcocer-Varela J. J.

Med. 2004; 199: 971-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). Thus, the level of circulating Treg does not always reflect the levels at the site of inflammation because Treg are typically increased at sites of inflammation (33Dejaco C. Duftner C. Grubeck-Loebenstein B. Schirmer M. Immunology. 2006; 117: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).When Tregs are increased at sites of inflammation, why does the autoimmunity still exist? Studies suggest that the suppressive activity of Treg may be maintained but that Teffs or chronically activated antigen-presenting cells in some autoimmune models may be able to resist this suppression (29André S. Tough D.F. Lacroix-Desmazes S. Kaveri S.V. Bayry J. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 174: 1575-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 32Walker L.S.

Clark R.B. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Both the MAPK and NFκB pathways have been implicated in the chronic activation of antigen-presenting cells (29André S. Tough D.F. Lacroix-Desmazes S. Kaveri S.V. Bayry J. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 174: 1575-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, the MAPK pathway, which is affected in cholesterol-loaded T cells from ABCG1−/− mice (50Armstrong A.J. Gebre A.K. Parks J.S. Hedrick C.C. J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), may also play a role in the ability of cells to overcome suppression by Treg. In addition, the cytokine environment may have an effect on the ability of Teff to overcome suppression by Treg, and resistance to Treg suppression by Teff typically occurs in the setting of chronic inflammation (29André S. Tough D.F. Lacroix-Desmazes S. Kaveri S.V. Bayry J. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 174: 1575-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 32Walker L.S. Immunology. 2009; 126: 466-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Dejaco C. Duftner C. Grubeck-Loebenstein B. Schirmer M. Immunology. 2006; 117: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although Tregs produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that can act to suppress Teff, Teffs produce inflammatory cytokines that can render Treg ineffective. Thus, it is important to maintain a balance between Treg and Teff.Although the increase in Treg in DKO mice may seem paradoxical considering the autoimmune phenotype, it may be that the function of LN Treg in DKO mice is impaired or that the Teffs are simply more effective at overcoming suppression. We have previously shown increased proliferation in CD4+ cells in DKO mice. The increase in LN Treg (which are CD4+) in DKO mice may be a direct result of increased CD4+ cell proliferation. In other words, Treg may be proliferating along with other CD4+ cells. It appears, however, that the Tregs are not proliferating to the same extent as other CD4+ cells because the ratio of Treg/Teff in DKO mice is reduced compared with both SKO and DKO+A-I. Nevertheless, treatment with apoA-I reduces inflammation in DKO mice, resulting in an increased LN Treg population. In this case, T cell activation is also reduced, suggesting that the Treg function is improved or that Teff cells are less resistant to Treg suppression. Overall, the ratio of Treg/Teff is increased in DKO+A-I mice compared with diet-fed mice. In DKO + A-I mice, apoA-I reduces inflammation, improving the ability of Treg to respond to Teff. In this case, the increased Treg/Teff ratio may be a result of selective proliferation of Treg. In other words, Tregs are now proliferating in increased proportion compared with other CD4+ cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that DKO mice have a defective Treg response caused by impaired Treg function or by improved ability of Teff to resist suppression and that the reduction of systemic inflammation in DKO + A-I mice allows for an improved Treg response.Interestingly, studies have suggested that Treg can prime DCs in sites of inflammation, leading to a reduction in co-stimulatory signaling with T cells (61Onishi Y. Fehervari Z. Yamaguchi T. Sakaguchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10113-10118Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 62Wing K. Lindgren S. Kollberg G. Lundgren A. Harris R.A. Rudin A. Lundin S. Suri-Payer E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These DCs gain the ability to migrate to secondary lymphoid organs where they present self-antigen to Teff. The reduction in co-stimulatory signaling results in reduced T cell activation (29André S. Tough D.F. Lacroix-Desmazes S. Kaveri S.V. Bayry J. Am. J. Pathol. 2009; 174: 1575-1587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This is an interesting point of reference considering the trend toward increased DCs in the LNs. It is possible that Tregs are also present in increased numbers in the skin, a major site of inflammation in DKO diet-fed mice (8Zabalawi M. Bharadwaj M. Horton H. Cline M. Willingham M. Thomas M.J.

Oral delivery of BSA bearing 51 molecules of mannoside (Man(51)-BSA) substantially reduced the BSA-induced anaphylactic response. Man(51)-BSA selectively targeted LPDCs that expressed SIGNR1 and induced the expression of interleukin-10 (IL-10), but not IL-6 or IL-12 p70. We found the same effects in IL-10-GFP knock-in (tiger) mice treated with Man(51)-BSA. The Man(51)-BSA-SIGNR1 axis in LPDCs, both in vitro and in vivo, promoted the generation of CD4(+) type 1 regulatory T (Tr1)-like cells that expressed IL-10 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), in a SIGNR-1- and IL-10-dependent manner, but not of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells. The Tr1-like cells could transfer tolerance. These results suggest that sugar-modified antigens might be used to induce oral tolerance by targeting SIGNR1 and LPDCs."
https://openalex.org/W2035136072,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an etiological agent of pulmonary tuberculosis, causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Pathogenic mycobacteria survive in the host by subverting host innate immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that are vital for eliciting immune responses to infectious agents, including pathogenic mycobacteria. DCs orchestrate distinct Th responses based on the signals they receive. In this perspective, deciphering the interactions of the proline-glutamic acid/proline-proline-glutamic acid (PE/PPE) family of proteins of M. tuberculosis with DCs assumes significant pathophysiological attributes. In this study, we demonstrate that Rv1917c (PPE34), a representative member of the proline-proline-glutamic-major polymorphic tandem repeat family, interacts with TLR2 and triggers functional maturation of human DCs. Signaling perturbations implicated a critical role for integrated cross-talk among PI3K-MAPK and NF-κB signaling cascades in Rv1917c-induced maturation of DCs. However, this maturation of DCs was associated with a secretion of high amounts of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, whereas Th1-polarizing cytokine IL-12 was not induced. Consistent with these results, Rv1917c-matured DCs favored secretion of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 from CD4(+) T cells and contributed to Th2-skewed cytokine balance ex vivo in healthy individuals and in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Interestingly, the Rv1917c-skewed Th2 immune response involved induced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in DCs. Taken together, these results indicate that Rv1917c facilitates a shift in the ensuing immunity toward the Th2 phenotype and could aid in immune evasion by mycobacteria."

Mitochondria were found to be the target both for amyloid precursor protein (APP) that accumulates in the mitochondrial import channels and for Aβ that interacts with several proteins inside mitochondria and leads to mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we have studied the role of mitochondrial γ-secretase in processing different substrates. We found that a significant proportion of APP is associated with mitochondria in cultured cells and that γ-secretase cleaves the shedded C-terminal part of APP identified as C83 associated with the outer membrane of mitochondria (OMM). Moreover, we have established the topology of the C83 in the OMM and found the APP intracellular domain (AICD) to be located inside mitochondria. Our data show for the first time that APP is a substrate for the mitochondrial γ-secretase and that AICD is produced inside mitochondria. Thus, we provide a mechanistic view of the mitochondria-associated APP metabolism where AICD, P3 peptide and potentially Aβ are produced locally and may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD.—Pavlov, P.

It is also shown that the pattern of differentiation seen in these cells is similar to wild-type (WT). Cells from open caudal neural tubes of Sp−/− embryos exhibit increased H3K27 methylation and decreased expression of KDM6B possibly due to up-regulation of KDM6B targeting micro-RNAs such as miR-138, miR-148a, miR-185, and miR-339-5p. In our model, folate reversed these epigenetic marks in folate-rescued Sp−/− embryos. Using tissue from caudal neural tubes of murine embryos we also examined H3K27me2 and KDM6B association with Hes1 and Neurog2 promoters at embryonic day E10.5, the proliferative stage, and E12.5, when neural differentiation begins. In Sp−/− embryos compared with WT, levels of H3K27me2 associated with the Hes1 promoter were increased at E10.5, and levels associated with the Neurog2 promoter were increased at E12.5. KDM6B association with Hes1 and Neurog2 promoters was inversely related to H3K27me2 levels. These epigenetic changes were reversed in folate-rescued Sp−/− embryos.

Introduction of FABP7 into FABP7-negative MG cells confers a pro-migratory/pro-invasive phenotype to the cells, whereas knockdown of FABP7 in MG cells that naturally express FABP7 results in reduced migration/invasion (4Liang Y.

These combined data suggest that FABP7 may enhance the infiltrative and/or invasive properties of tumor cells, thereby contributing to tumor recurrence and decreased patient survival. FABP7 is a member of the FABP family of lipid chaperones involved in the uptake and intracellular trafficking of fatty acids. In vitro ligand binding studies have shown that the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ω-3-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6) is the preferred ligand of FABP7. FABP7 also binds ω-6-arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4), albeit with an ∼4-fold lower affinity (11Balendiran G.K. Schnutgen F. Scapin G. Borchers T. Xhong N. Lim K. Godbout R. Spener F. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27045-27054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DHA and AA have been shown to have opposite effects on tumor growth, with DHA inhibiting growth and AA promoting growth (12Larsson S.C. Kumlin M. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Wolk A. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2004; 79: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). FABPs, found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, are believed to play a role in gene regulation by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), nuclear receptors that function as transcription factors. Specifically, liver FABP (FABP1) has been shown to bind and activate PPARα and PPARγ (13Wolfrum C. Borrmann C.M. Borchers T. Spener F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 2323-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Adipocyte FABP (FABP4) and keratinocyte FABP (FABP5) bind PPARγ and PPARβ, respectively (14Tan N.S. Shaw N.S. Vinckenbosch N.

Acta. 2006; 1761: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that nuclear FABPs can deliver their fatty acid ligands to PPARs, thereby regulating PPAR transcriptional activity. Increased expression of PPARα is associated with a worse prognosis in MG (17Benedetti E. Galzio R. Laurenti G. D'Angelo B. Melchiorre E. Cifone M.G. Fanelli F. Muzi P. Coletti G. Alecci M. Sotgiu A. Cerù M.P. Cimini A. Int. J. Immunopathol. Pharmacol. 2010; 23: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), whereas PPARγ is generally associated with growth arrest and apoptosis in these tumors (18Papi A. Tatenhorst L. Terwel D.

Cancer. 2008; 99: 2044-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although relationships between specific fatty acids and FABPs, FABPs and cancer, and fatty acids and cancer have been described previously, there has been no concerted effort to investigate the interdependence of fatty acids and FABPs on tumorigenic properties. In a previous study, Wang et al. (20Wang M. Liu Y.E. Ni J. Aygun B. Goldberg I.D. Shi Y.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6482-6487PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated ∼50% growth inhibition of breast cancer cells stably transfected with an FABP7 expression construct in the presence of DHA. Furthermore, treatment of FABP5-expressing PC12 cells with DHA increased neurite extension (21Liu J.W. Almaguel F.G. Bu L. De Leon D.D. De Leon M. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 2015-2029PubMed Google Scholar). These data highlight the importance of FABPs in determining tumor cell response to fatty acids. Here, we examine the effect of DHA and AA on FABP7-mediated cell migration in MG. We describe an inhibitory role for DHA in FABP7-mediated cell migration and a permissive role for AA in FABP7-mediated cell migration. Intriguingly, DHA-mediated inhibition of cell migration functions through PPARγ and requires nuclear localization of FABP7, whereas stimulation of cell migration by FABP7 and AA is dependent on activation of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. We propose a model whereby relative levels of DHA and AA, and the fatty acid-dependent subcellular distribution of FABP7, determine the migratory potential of MG cells. The importance of our findings resonates 2-fold as they provide a molecular mechanism for FABP7-induced MG cell migration and point to the potential use of DHA as an anti-infiltrative therapeutic agent in the treatment of MG. The origin and FABP7 status of MG cell lines U87, U251, U373, and M049, as well as the generation of stable U87 clonal populations transfected with either empty pREP4 vector (FABP7(−)) or a pREP4-FABP7 expression construct (FABP7(+)), have been described previously (10Mita R. Coles J.E. Glubrecht D.D. Sung R. Sun X. Godbout R. Neoplasia. 2007; 9: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Bisgrove D.A. Monckton E.A. Packer M. Godbout R. J. Biol.

Biol. 2009; 391: 282-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of U87 cells was by calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation, with 40–50% transfection efficiency. Transiently transfected cells were analyzed 48 h after removal of the DNA. Unless otherwise stated, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Whole cell lysates were prepared by incubating cells on ice for 20 min in 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm NaF, 0.1% SDS, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sci), 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm DTT. Nuclear cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells at 4 °C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation (15,000 × g at 4 °C for 3 min) and lysed by vigorous shaking in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF. Nuclear lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Lysates were electrophoresed in a 13.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by electroblotting to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were immunostained with rabbit anti-FABP7 (3Godbout R. Bisgrove D.A. Shkolny D. Day 3rd, R.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), mouse anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-FABP5 (HyCult Biotechnology), goat anti-COX-2 (sc-1747; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-PPARα (Chemicon), mouse anti-PPARβ (Chemicon), or mouse anti-PPARγ (Chemicon) antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) using the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare). Twenty thousand cells were plated in DMEM (without FCS) in the top chamber of HTS multiwell inserts with a porous 8 μm PET membrane separating the top and bottom chambers (Transwell; BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated for 6 h in a CO2 incubator to allow cell migration to the bottom chamber containing chemoattractant (DMEM plus 10% FCS). Cells that migrated to the bottom chamber were fixed and stained with 2% crystal violet in 20% methanol. The cells were photographed using a 2.5× lens and four frames combined to reconstruct the entire well. Cells were then counted using Metamorph version 7.7 imaging software. Cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then permeabilized in PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-FABP7 antibody was used at a 1:200 dilution, followed by secondary Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cedarlane Laboratories). All images were collected on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a 40×/1.3 oil immersion lens. Lipidex® 1000 (Sigma) was used to delipidate recombinant FABP7 and carry out the fatty acid binding assays. Lipidex 1000 removes unbound and/or protein-bound fatty acids from aqueous solutions in a temperature-dependent manner. For delipidation, recombinant GST-tagged FABP7 was incubated in 1.0-ml amber glass vials along with 50% w/v Lipidex in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 10 min at 37 °C. The Lipidex/protein mixture was then spun down for 2 min at 4,000 × g, and the incubation repeated twice using fresh Lipidex-conjugated beads. For fatty acid binding assays, delipidated FABP7 was incubated in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with varying concentrations of [1-14C]DHA (Moravek Biochemicals) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Unbound fatty acids were removed from the solution by adding 50 μl of an ice-cold Lipidex/buffer suspension (1:1, w/v) followed by a 10-min incubation at 4 °C. The mixture was then centrifuged for 5 min at 4,000 × g, and fatty acid binding was calculated from the amount of radioactivity present in the supernatant as measured by a scintillation counter. Graphs were generated and analyzed using GraphPad Prism software version 5. Cells were transfected with 10 nm of the following Stealth siRNAs (Invitrogen) using LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX (Invitrogen): FABP7 (5′-CAAACCAACGGUAAUUAUCAGUCAA-3′ (NM_001446_stealth_405)); PPARγ (5′-CCAGUGGUUGCAGAUUACAAGUAUG-3′ (NM_13872_stealth_425)); PPARγ (5′-AGGGAGUUUCUAAAGAGCCUGCGAA-3′ (NM_13772_stealth_1295)); PPARβ (5′-CCACUACGGUGUUCAUGCAUGUGAG-3′ (NM_006238_stealth_561)); PPARβ (5′-UCAGUGAUAUCAUUGAGCCUAAGUU-3′ (NM_006238_stealth_1280)); scrambled siRNA (StealthTM RNAi Negative Control Low and Medium GC Duplex). The Transwell migration assay was carried out 72 h post-transfection using 20,000 cells/well. The remaining cells were used for the preparation of cell lysates and used for Western blot analysis to verify knockdown. PGE2 levels were determined by ELISA using the protocol supplied by the manufacturer (prostaglandin E2 Biotrak Enzyme Immunoassay System, GE Healthcare). Cells were seeded in triplicate on 96-well plates at 50,000 cells/well and cultured for 24 h. Plates were read at 450 nm using a microplate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA, BMG LABTECH). Fatty acids (Sigma) were dissolved in ethanol and then complexed to fatty acid-free BSA (Roche Applied Science) over a steady stream of nitrogen gas. The final concentration of ethanol in our experiments was 0.1%. NS398 (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO (Sigma) to generate a 200 mm (1000×) stock solution. The final concentration of DMSO in the medium was 0.1%. The 400-bp human FABP7 cDNA encoding the entire open reading frame was inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector at the EcoRV site. To generate the nuclear localization signal (NLS) mutant, site-directed mutagenesis of FABP7 at K21A (AAG→GCG), R30A (AGG→GCG), and Q31A (CAG→GCG) was carried out by sequential PCR (24Cormack B. Castaño I. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 199-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using partially complementary primers carrying the appropriate point mutations. These primers were used in conjunction with pcDNA3.1 vector primers to generate DNA fragments corresponding to full-length FABP7. To generate the nonfatty acid-binding mutant, the same technique was applied, using primers carrying the following point mutations: F104A (TTT→AGA), R126A (CGC→GCC), and Y128A (TAT→GCT). These primers, which contained an XhoI recognition site, were used along with primers to the pcDNA3.1 vector sequence spanning the BamHI site to allow directional cloning into pcDNA3.1. The FABP7 cDNA inserts were sequenced to ensure that they were error-free. Expression of mutant FABP7 was confirmed by transfection into U87MG and Western blot analysis. Previous work has shown that stable transfection of an FABP7 expression construct into FABP7(−) U87MG cells results in increased motility and migration (10Mita R. Coles J.E. Glubrecht D.D. Sung R. Sun X. Godbout R. Neoplasia. 2007; 9: 734-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In vitro ligand binding studies indicate that FABP7 binds both DHA and AA, with equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of 53.4 and 207 nm, respectively (11Balendiran G.K. Schnutgen F. Scapin G. Borchers T. Xhong N. Lim K. Godbout R. Spener F. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27045-27054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore used the Transwell assay to examine the effect of DHA and AA on the migration of FABP7(−) and FABP7(+) U87 cells. Cells were cultured in growth medium (DMEM plus 10% FCS) supplemented with 60 μm BSA-complexed DHA, AA, palmitic acid (PA; 16:0), or BSA alone for 24 h. As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, none of the fatty acids tested had an effect on FABP7(−) U87 cell migration, with an average of ∼250 cells migrating through the upper chamber of Transwell inserts. As expected, FABP7-expressing U87 cells cultured in 10% FCS supplemented with BSA showed increased migration compared with FABP7(−) U87 cells (1553 versus 294 cells/well). Growth in PA had no effect on FABP7(+) U87 cell migration; however, growth in DHA resulted in a 5-fold decrease in cell migration, with an average of 279 cells migrating to the bottom chamber compared with 1553 cells in the BSA control (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1A). In contrast, FABP7(+) U87 cells cultured in AA showed a small but significant increase in cell migration, with 1812 cells/well migrating to the bottom chamber compared with 1553 in the BSA control (p < 0.01). These results indicate a strong link between FABP7-mediated cell migration and the presence of DHA or AA. Studying clonal populations of U87 cells that differ in whether they have been transfected with empty vector or an FABP7 expression construct represents a highly controlled experimental situation. To broaden the scope of our study, we examined the effect of AA and DHA on three MG cell lines that naturally express FABP7: U251, U373, and M049 (Fig. 2A). U251 and U373 cultured in the presence of BSA had migratory activities that were similar to that of FABP7(+) U87 cells (Fig. 2A). Although growth of U251 and U373 cells in AA did not significantly increase cell migration, U251 and U373 cells cultured in DHA showed the same decrease in migration observed for FABP7(+) U87 cells. In contrast, M049 cells showed significantly reduced migration compared with the other FABP7-expressing MG cell lines. Similar to FABP7(−) U87 cells, neither DHA nor AA had an effect on M049 cell migration. These results indicate that factors other than FABP7 can affect MG cell migration. Of note, FABP5 is highly expressed in M049 compared with U251 and U373 (Fig. 2A). We then used siRNA to reduce FABP7 levels in U251 cells. Knockdown of FABP7 resulted in a significant decrease in cell migration, with 641 FABP7(↓) U251 cells migrating to the bottom chamber in comparison with 1490 cells for U251 control (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2B). Growth in the presence of DHA or AA had little effect on the migration of FABP7(↓) U251 cells, in keeping with the results obtained with FABP7(−) U87 cells. Because there was general, if not complete, agreement between the results obtained with U87, U251, and U373, we pursued our analyses with the U87-FABP7(−) and U87-FABP7(+) clonal populations. Fetal calf serum contains >20 different fatty acids, including DHA and AA at concentrations of 4 and 11.5 μm, respectively. To study the effects of DHA and AA on migration in the absence of FCS, U87-FABP7(−) and U87-FABP7(+) MG cells were cultured in DMEM without FCS for 24 h and then treated with DHA, AA, PA, or BSA in the absence of FCS for 24 h (i.e. 48-h total serum starvation). Although there was a 30% decrease in the number of serum-starved BSA-treated U87-FABP7(+) cells that migrated to the bottom chamber compared with cells cultured in 10% FCS (Fig. 1B), the overall trend was similar to that observed for cells grown in the presence of FCS, with DHA inhibiting and AA stimulating cell migration. There was an average of 1202 cells/well for the BSA control compared with 199 cells/well for DHA-treated cells and 1446 cells/well for AA-treated cells. Again, PA treatment did not affect cell migration, and none of the fatty acids affected the migration of U87-FABP7(−) cells. These results indicate that DHA and AA can regulate FABP7-mediated U87 cell migration. A number of studies have shown that ω-3 fatty acids have anti-tumorigenic properties, inhibiting tumor growth and preventing vascularization and cell migration. In contrast, ω-6 fatty acids have pro-tumorigenic properties. It has been postulated that the ratio of ω-3 to ω-6 fatty acids is key to the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer (25Simopoulos A.P. World Rev. Nutr. Diet. 2009; 99: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To address whether the ratio of DHA:AA, as opposed to individual concentrations of DHA or AA, is driving the effects observed in Fig. 1, A and B, we treated U87-FABP7(+) MG cells with varying concentrations of both DHA and AA, and we measured their migration using the Transwell assay (Fig. 1C). The migration of U87-FABP7(+) cells cultured in growth medium supplemented with 60 μm each of DHA and AA was inhibited by 75%, with an average of 371 cells/well migrating to the bottom chamber compared with 1513 cells/well in the untreated control (Fig. 1C). Cell migration was also inhibited by 74% when the concentration of DHA was halved (30 μm DHA; 60 μm AA). However, when levels of AA exceeded those of DHA by 3-fold or more, the inhibitory effects of DHA on cell migration were negated, with 1596 cells/well migrating to the bottom chamber when the DHA:AA ratio was 1:3 (30 μm DHA; 90 μm AA), and 1646 cells/well migrating to the bottom chamber with a DHA:AA ratio of 1:4 (30 μm DHA; 120 μm AA). These results are expected in light of in vitro data indicating that DHA has a four times greater binding affinity for FABP7 than AA (11Balendiran G.K. Schnutgen F. Scapin G. Borchers T. Xhong N. Lim K. Godbout R. Spener F. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27045-27054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increasing the concentration of DHA, from 60 to 120 μm, in the presence of 30 μm AA, did not result in further inhibition of cell migration (Fig. 1C). PA at concentrations ranging from 30 to 120 μm had no effect on cell migration (Fig. 3). Based on cellular morphology and growth rate, high concentrations of fatty acids had no adverse effect on the survival of FABP7(+) U87 cells. These combined data suggest that different pathways are activated when FABP7 is bound to DHA or AA, with DHA inhibiting and AA stimulating cell migration. FABPs play an important role in the transport of their fatty acid ligands to various subcellular compartments, including endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and nucleus. FABP7 is found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of MG cells, with some tumors preferentially expressing FABP7 in either the nucleus or cytoplasm (4Liang Y. Diehn M. Watson N. Bollen A.W. Aldape K.D. Nicholas M.K. Lamborn K.R. Berger M.S. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Israel M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 5814-5819Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 6Kaloshi G. Mokhtari K.

To investigate whether the subcellular localization of FABP7 might be dependent on availability of specific fatty acid ligands, we examined the subcellular distribution of FABP7 in U87-FABP7(+) and U251, in the presence and absence of DHA and AA. When cells were cultured in medium depleted of fatty acids (i.e. serum-starved for 24 h), FABP7 was primarily found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, A and D). Addition of 60 μm DHA to DMEM resulted in FABP7 localization to the nucleus (Fig. 4, B and E), suggesting that DHA-bound FABP7 is sequestered to the nucleus. In contrast, a relatively uniform distribution of FABP7 was observed throughout the cell in the presence of 60 μm AA (Fig. 4, C and F). Alterations in the subcellular distribution of FABP7 were not accompanied by any changes in the levels of FABP7 protein (Fig. 5). The dynamic shuttling of FABP7 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in the presence of DHA (and to a lesser extent AA) suggests a role for FABP7 in delivering its fatty acid ligands to the nucleus.FIGURE 5Western blot analysis of FABP7 in U87-FABP7(+) stable transfectants treated with 60 μm BSA, AA, DHA, or PA. Whole cell lysates (25 μg/lane) were prepared from U87-FABP7(+) and electrophoresed in a 13.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and sequentially immunostained with rabbit anti-FABP7 antibody and mouse anti-actin antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies.

We therefore mutated the FABP7 Phe-104/Arg-126/Tyr-128 residues to Ala-104/Ala-126/Ala-128 (FABP7FAB) to gain further insight into the importance of fatty acid binding to FABP7-mediated migration in MG cells. FABP7FAB was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector and transfected into U87-FABP7(−) MG cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of FABP7FAB in the cytoplasm with little mutant protein in the nucleus (Fig. 6). The abundance of FABP7FAB in the cytoplasm indicates that any structural changes resulting from the site-directed mutagenesis had little or no effect on protein stability. Subcellular localization experiments verified that FABP7FAB mostly resides in the cytoplasm, in contrast to wild-type FABP7 (FABP7WT), which is abundant in the nucleus (Fig. 7, A and B). These findings are in keeping with our previous results indicating that serum starvation prevents FABP7 from accumulating in the nucleus.FIGURE 7Fatty acid binding is required for migration.

https://openalex.org/W2164773432,"We demonstrate here that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) uses sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 4 (S1P4) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) to stimulate the extracellular signal regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK-1/2) pathway in MDA-MB-453 cells. This was based on several lines of evidence. First, the S1P stimulation of ERK-1/2 was abolished by JTE013, which we show here is an S1P2/4 antagonist and reduced by siRNA knockdown of S1P4. Second, the S1P-stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 was almost completely abolished by a HER2 inhibitor (ErbB2 inhibitor II) and reduced by siRNA knockdown of HER2 expression. Third, phyto-S1P, which is an S1P4 agonist, stimulated ERK-1/2 activation in an S1P4- and HER2-dependent manner. Fourth, FTY720 phosphate, which is an agonist at S1P1,3,4,5 but not S1P2 stimulated activation of ERK-1/2. Fifth, S1P stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2, which was reduced by JTE013. HER2 which is an orphan receptor tyrosine kinase is the preferred dimerization partner of the EGF receptor. However, EGF-stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 was not affected by siRNA knockdown of HER2 or by ErbB2 (epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (or HER2)) inhibitor II in MDA-MB-453 cells. Moreover, S1P-stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 does not require an EGF receptor. Thus, S1P and EGF function in a mutually exclusive manner. In conclusion, the magnitude of the signaling gain on the ERK-1/2 pathway produced in response to S1P can be increased by HER2 in MDA-MB-453 cells. The linkage of S1P with an oncogene suggests that S1P and specifically S1P4 may have an important role in breast cancer progression. We demonstrate here that the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) uses sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 4 (S1P4) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) to stimulate the extracellular signal regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK-1/2) pathway in MDA-MB-453 cells.

Moreover, S1P-stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 does not require an EGF receptor. Thus, S1P and EGF function in a mutually exclusive manner. In conclusion, the magnitude of the signaling gain on the ERK-1/2 pathway produced in response to S1P can be increased by HER2 in MDA-MB-453 cells. The linkage of S1P with an oncogene suggests that S1P and specifically S1P4 may have an important role in breast cancer progression. There is increasing evidence that suggests a role for the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) 2The abbreviations used are: S1Psphingosine 1-phosphateSKsphingosine kinaseGPCRG protein-coupled receptorERestrogen receptorQRT-PCRquantitative RT-PCRPTXpertussis toxin. in breast cancer. S1P binds to a family of five GPCR, termed S1Pn (where n = 1–5), that are differentially coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins (Gi, Gq, and G12/13) to regulate various effectors such as MAP kinases linked to diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, cell survival, and differentiation (1Pyne S.

The specificity of signaling in terms of which kinase modules are activated is dependent upon the receptor sub-type involved and is cell context-specific. S1P is produced by the enzyme sphingosine kinase (SK), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine to produce S1P. SK (which exists as two isoforms termed SK1 and SK2) is activated by agonists such as antigen, platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor, tumor necrosis factor α, and epidermal growth factor (EGF), resulting in an increase in intracellular S1P. SK1 activation and/or translocation is regulated by phosphorylation catalyzed by ERK-1/2 and by CIB1 (calcium and integrin-binding protein 1) (14Pitson S.M. Moretti P.A. Zebol J.R. Lynn H.E. Xia P.

S1P has an important role in breast cancer cells in terms of regulating survival, proliferation, and migration (16Nava V.E. Hobson J.P. Murthy S. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 281: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 17Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Edsall L. Nava V.E. Spiegel S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6185-6191PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sarkar S.

For instance, ectopic expression of SK1 increased S1P levels, estrogen-dependent tumorigenesis, and blocked apoptosis of MCF-7 cells induced by anticancer drugs, sphingosine, and tumor necrosis factor α (16Nava V.E. Hobson J.P. Murthy S. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 281: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). SK1 and S1P also are required for EGF-induced MCF-7 migration, proliferation, and cell survival (18Sarkar S. Maceyka M. Hait N.C. Paugh S.W. Sankala H. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 5313-5317Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). S1P also stimulates breast cancer cell growth through activation of the serum response element and indirectly by enhancing insulin-like growth factor (IGF) II synthesis and function (19Goetzl E.J. Dolezalova H. Kong Y. Zeng L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4732-4737PubMed Google Scholar). The HER2/neu/c-erbB-2 gene encodes a 185-kDa transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, which is related to other members of the EGF receptor family (20Schechter A.L. Hung M.C. Vaidyanathan L. Weinberg R.A. Yang-Feng T.L. Francke U. Ullrich A. Coussens L. Science. 1985; 229: 976-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overexpression of HER2/neu is found in up to 30% of primary breast cancers and increased tumor invasion, poor prognosis, and therapeutic resistance is correlated with its expression (21Borg A. Tandon A.K. Sigurdsson H. Clark G.M. Fernö M. Fuqua S.A. Killander D. McGuire W.L. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4332-4337PubMed Google Scholar). A soluble ligand for HER2 has not been identified, although HER2 operates as a shared receptor subunit of other ErbBs. In this regard, HER2 is a heterodimerization partner of the EGF receptor (22Graus-Porta D. Beerli R.R. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1647-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). HER2 delays EGF dissociation from its receptor, improves coupling of the EGF receptor and stimulation of the ERK-1/2 pathway, and impedes EGF receptor down-regulation. Thus, HER2 is a master regulator that drives epithelial cell proliferation. An example of this is evident from studies that demonstrate that the ectopic expression of HER2/neu in MCF-7 (estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative) cells stimulates the PI3K/Akt pathway and down-regulates p53 (23Zheng L. Ren J.Q. Li H. Kong Z.L. Zhu H.G. Cell Res. 2004; 14: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which increases cell survival. Breast cancer cell lines can be categorized into three major phenotypic groups that include the following: (i) luminal epithelial-like ER-positive/HER2-negative cells (e.g. MCF-7 cells, weakly invasive); (ii) weakly luminal epithelial-like HER2-positive cells (e.g. MDA-MB-453 cells); and (iii) stromal/mesenchymal phenotype (e.g. MDA-MB-231), which are characterized as ER-negative/HER2-negative cells. In this study, we have used MDA-MB-453 cells to investigate the role of S1P in regulating the ERK-1/2 pathway, which is well established as having a role in cancer metastasis. All general biochemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. High glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and European fetal calf serum, penicillin-streptomycin were from Invitrogen. DharmaFECTTM 2 reagent was from Dharmacon (Dharmacon, Cromlington, UK). BioScriptTM was from Bioline (London, UK). HER2 and S1P2 and S1P4 siRNA and anti-phosphorylated ERK-1/2 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. EGF receptor siRNA was a gift from V. Natarajan (University of Chicago).

S1P and phyto-S1P were from Avanti Polar Lipids, EGF was from Sigma, JTE013 was from Tocris Biosciences (Bristol, UK), and CAY10444 and SEW2871 were from Cayman Chemicals (Tallinn, Estonia). Recombinant heregulin, ErbB2 inhibitor II, AG 879, and AG 1478 were from Merck Biosciences (Nottingham, UK). FTY720 and FTY720 phosphate were gifts from R. Bittman (The City University of New York). MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Rockville, MD) and were grown in a monolayer culture in high glucose DMEM with 10% European FCS and 1% Pen-Strep (104 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 10 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HEK 293 cells were grown as above with the exception that minimum essential medium was used instead of DMEM. MCF-7 Neo and MCF-7 HER2 breast cancer cells (from R. Schiff, Baylor College) were grown in a monolayer culture in DMEM with 10% European FCS and 1% Pen-Strep, 0.4% geneticin, and 15 μg/ml insulin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. HTC4 cells stably expressing S1P2, S1P3, or S1P4 receptors were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 500 μg/ml of geneticin. Knockdown of HER2 expression was achieved using sequence-specific HER2 siRNA (HER2 receptor siRNA (AAGGGGCUGGCUCCGAUGUAUUUdTdT and AAAUACAUCGGAGCCAGCCCCUUdTdT)) and scrambled siRNA as control (GCGUCGGAGUGGCAUCUUAAUGUdTdT and ACAUUAAGAUGCCACUCCGACGCdTdT). The HER2 receptor-targeted sequence is AAGGGGCUGGCUCCGAUGUAUUU. siRNA transfection was performed according to the protocol detailed by Dharmacon. Briefly, cells grown on 24-well plates were transfected with 100–400 nm siRNA prepared in a mix with DharmaFECTTM 2 reagent and DMEM containing 10% European FCS. Cells were also treated with EGF receptor siRNA (100 nm, Dharmacon) in the same manner. The cells were cultured for 48 h before being serum-starved for 24 h prior to stimulation. RNA was isolated from MDA-MB-453 cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis was performed by using the SuperScript First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Amplification was performed for 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s with initial activation of enzyme at 94 °C for 1 min using the ABI Model 7300 Real Time PCR machine. The following primer pairs were used: GAPDH, (forward) CTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG and (reverse) GGGCCATCCACAGTCTTCT; S1P1, (forward) GCTGGGTCATCTCCCTCAT and (reverse) GCAGTTCCAGCCCATGAT; S1P2, (forward) CCAACAAGGTCCAGGAACAC and (reverse) GCAACAGAGGATGACGATGA; S1P3, (forward) TCAGGGAGGGCAGTATGTTC and (reverse) CCAGTAAGCTGCAGGTGGA; S1P4, (forward) GAAGACGGTGCTGATGATCC and (reverse) CAGAGGTTGGAGCCAAAGAC; and S1P5, (forward) GGTGAGCGAGGTCATCGT and (reverse) CCAGGAGCAGGAACATGG. Quantitative values were obtained from the threshold cycle value (Ct). GAPDH was quantified as an internal RNA control, and each sample was normalized on the basis of its GAPDH content. Samples were run in quadruplicate. Data are representative of three independent experiments. HEK 293 and MDA-MB-453 cells were transfected with HA-tagged S1P4 plasmid constructs using LipofectamineTM 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection was performed for 24 h at 37 °C before serum starvation for a further 24 h prior to harvesting in Laemmli buffer and analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Analysis of proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was performed as described previously (24Alderton F. Rakhit S. Kong K.C. Palmer T. Sambi B. Pyne S. Pyne N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28578-28585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) using anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2, anti-ERK2, anti-HER2, and anti-HRP phosphotyrosine antibodies. Monitoring of S1P-evoked changes in intracellular Ca2+ was done in HTC4 cells stably expressing S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, or S1P4 receptors originally described by An et al. (10An S. Bleu T. Zheng Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 787-794PubMed Google Scholar), which were generously provided by Dr. Edward Goetzl (University of California, San Francisco). The assay protocol was identical to that described in our previous publication (25Lu X. Sun C. Valentine W.J. Shuyu E. Liu J. Tigyi G. Bittman R. J. Org. Chem. 2009; 74: 3192-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Wild type HTC4 cells do not respond to S1P with changes in [Ca2+]i. HTC4 cells stably expressing each receptor were plated onto black-wall clear-bottom 96-well plates (Corning Inc. Life Sciences, Acton, MA) at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and cultured overnight. The following day, the culture medium was replaced with modified Krebs buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.62 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 6 mm glucose, pH 7.4), and the cells were serum-starved for 4 h. Subsequently, cells were loaded with Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen) for 30 min in modified Krebs buffer containing 2% (v/v) pluronic acid. After incubating the cells with Fura-2 AM, the cells were rinsed with Krebs buffer, and changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration were monitored by determining the ratio of emitted light intensities at 520 nm in response to excitation at 340 and 380 nm using FLEXstation II (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Each well was monitored for 80 s. To test antagonist activity of the inhibitors JTE013 and CAY10444, increasing concentrations of the inhibitors were mixed with a constant concentration of S1P and added automatically after 15 s of baseline measurement. Each test was performed in quadruplicate. Significant difference between two experimental groups was determined by the Student's t test at a p value of 0.05. Data were plotted and fitted a sigmoid function by using the nonlinear curve-fitting feature of KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Essex Junction, VT). The medium was removed, and cells were lysed in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (1 ml) containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and aprotinin (all protease inhibitors were at 10 μg/ml, pH 8) for 10 min at 4 °C. The material was harvested, centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and 200–400 μl of cell lysate supernatant (equalized for protein, 0.5–1 mg/ml) combined with 20 μl of protein A or G-Sepharose and incubated for 20 min at 4°c. The samples were centrifuged at 22,000 × g, and the supernatant was taken for immunoprecipitation with anti-HER2 or anti-ERK-1/2 antibody (5 μg of anti-HER2 antibody or 3 μg of anti-ERK-1/2 antibody and 20–40 μl of one part immunoprecipitation buffer and one part protein A or G Sepharose CL4B, respectively). After agitation for 2 h at 4 °C, the immune complex was collected by centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 15 s at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and once in buffer A without Nonidet P-40. The immunoprecipitates were then combined with boiling sample buffer containing 62 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.7, 1.25% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 3.75% (v/v) mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunoprecipitates were combined with a phosphorylation mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 5 mm-MgCl2, 25 μm ATP, and 5μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg myelin basic protein (MBP) and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. Incubations were terminated by addition of boiling sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The cell pellet slides were first dewaxed and rehydrated through a series of xylene and alcohol washes. Antigen retrieval was performed for S1P2 by microwaving the slides under pressure in a Tris EDTA buffer for 5 min (pH 8.0) and for S1P4 in 10 mm citrate buffer at 96 °C in for 20 min. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked using 3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 min, and nonspecific background staining was reduced by blocking with a 1:20 concentration of horse serum diluted in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min. The sections were incubated with the primary antibody for S1P2 and S1P4 (Exalpha, Shirley, MA). Each antibody was incubated at a dilution of 1:100 at 4 °C overnight. EnVision-HRP conjugate (DAKO, Cambridgeshire, UK) was used for signal amplification and positive staining was identified using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine chromagen (Vector Laboratories). The slides were then counterstained with hematoxylin and Scott's tap water substitute before dehydration and mounting (26McGlynn L.M. Kirkegaard T. Edwards J. Tovey S. Cameron D. Twelves C.

Breast Cancer Research. 2004; 6: R246-R251Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Densitometric quantification of Western blots was performed using the Molecular Analyst Software (Bio-Rad). Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism software, using one-way analysis of variance followed by a Newman-Keuls post hoc test. MDA-MB-453 cells are HER2+ as evidenced by immunodetection of HER2 (Mr = 185 kDa) with anti-HER2 antibody (Fig. 1a). In these experiments, MDA-MB-231 cells were used as a negative control for Western blotting, as these cells are HER2-null (Fig. 1a). Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that S1P3 was the most abundant S1P receptor mRNA transcript, with small quantities of S1P2/4, and very minor expression of S1P1/5 mRNA (Fig. 1b). Treatment of MDA-MB-453 cells with S1P stimulated the phosphorylation/activation of ERK-1/2, which was reduced by pretreating these cells with pertussis toxin (PTX, which uncouples GPCR from Gi) (Fig. 2, a and b). These data suggest that S1P uses a heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptor to regulate the ERK-1/2 pathway. PTX did not significantly reduce EGF-induced activation of ERK-1/2 (Fig. 2, a and b, p > 0.05 for EGF + PTX versus EGF). The identity of the S1P receptor involved in regulating the ERK-1/2 pathway was evaluated using pharmacological agents that demonstrate selectivity at S1P receptors. We used JTE013, which is reported to be an S1P2-selective antagonist (28Ohmori T. Yatomi Y. Osada M. Kazama F. Takafuta T. Ikeda H. Ozaki Y. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and CAY10444 (29Koide Y. Hasegawa T. Takahashi A. Endo A. Mochizuki N. Nakagawa M. Nishida A. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which is an S1P3 antagonist. To further characterize the pharmacological specificity of JTE013 and CAY10444, we used HTC4 cells in which S1P2,3,4 were separately stably expressed, and intracellular calcium mobilization was measured using the Fura-2 indicator dye. We found that JTE013 reduced S1P-stimulated calcium mobilization in cells overexpressing S1P2, whereas CAY10444 was very weakly effective at concentrations >1 μm (Fig. 3a). In contrast, JTE013 had no effect on calcium mobilization induced by S1P in cells overexpressing S1P3, whereas CAY10444 reduced this response (Fig. 3a), thereby confirming specificity of CAY10444 at S1P3. Surprisingly, we found that JTE013 can also function as an S1P4 antagonist, as evidenced by results showing that JTE013 potently reduced S1P-stimulated calcium mobilization (Ki = 236.9 nm) in cells overexpressing S1P4, whereas CAY10444 was without effect (Fig. 3a). As there are no selective S1P4 antagonists available, we used JTE013 as a tool to investigate the role of S1P2/4 in mediating the effect of S1P on the activation of ERK-1/2 in MDA-MB-453 cells. We found that the S1P-induced activation of ERK-1/2 was substantially reduced by JTE013 and was not affected by CAY10444 (Fig. 3, b and c). Confirmation that MDA-MB-453 cells lack functional S1P1 was evidenced by the finding that the S1P1-selective agonist SEW2871 was without effect on ERK-1/2 activation (Fig. 3d).FIGURE 3S1P receptor specificity by JTE013 and CAY10444 and their effect in MDA-MB-453 cells. a, specificity of S1P antagonists: graphs showing the effect of JTE013 or CAY10444 on S1P-stimulated calcium mobilization in HTC4 cells overexpressing recombinant S1P2 or S1P3 or S1P4. b–d, MDA-MB-453 cells were pretreated with vehicle, JTE013 (10 μm), or CAY10444 (10 μm) for 15 min prior to stimulation with and without EGF (50 ng/ml) or S1P (5 μm or indicated concentration) or SEW 2871 (1 or 10 μm) for 10 min. b, the Western blot shows the effect of JTE013 or CAY10444 on S1P- and EGF-stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 in MDA-MB-453 cells.

In b and d, phosphorylated ERK-1/2 was detected on Western blots probed with anti-phosphorylated ERK-1/2 antibody. Blots were also probed with anti-ERK-1/2 antibody to ensure equal protein loading. In c, results are expressed as P-ERK-1/2:ERK-2 ratios (mean ± S.D.) for n = 3 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also used specific siRNA approaches to knock down expression of the S1P4 receptor in MDA-MB-453 cells. In this regard, we found that siRNA knockdown of S1P4 reduced the S1P-stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 (Fig. 4, a and b). We confirmed by QRT-PCR that S1P4 siRNA reduced S1P4 mRNA transcript and had no effect on the S1P2 or S1P3 mRNA transcript (Fig. 4c). We also detected S1P4 protein (Mr = 42 kDa) in lysates of MDA-MB-453 cells on Western blots probed with anti-S1P4 antibody and found that S1P4 siRNA partially reduced expression (55 ± 12% reduction, n = 5) of the protein (Fig. 4c). In addition, immunohistochemical staining of MDA-MB-453 cells with anti-S1P4 antibody demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of S1P4 reduced immunostaining (Fig. 4d). We could also confirm increased immunostaining when MDA-MB-453 cells were transfected with a S1P4 plasmid construct (Fig. 4d). Collectively, these data confirm expression of S1P4 protein in MDA-MB-453 cells, specificity of the antibody, and effectiveness of S1P4 siRNA treatment. Evidence to exclude S1P2 was obtained using S1P2 siRNA, which did not reduce activation of ERK-1/2 by S1P (Fig. 4e). immunohistochemical staining of MDA-MB-453 cells with anti-S1P2 antibody demonstrated that siRNA knockdown of S1P2 eliminated immunostaining (Fig. 4d), thereby confirming expression of S1P2 protein in MDA-MB-453 cells, specificity of the antibody and successful knockdown of S1P2. Knockdown of S1P2 with specific siRNA was more effective than corresponding knockdown of S1P4 with its respective siRNA (Fig. 4d). The residual S1P4 expression after siRNA knockdown might explain the incomplete abolition of S1P-stimulated ERK-1/2 activation with S1P4 siRNA (Fig. 4a), whereas JTE013 via S1P4 antagonism is completely effective (Fig. 3b). In addition, we used FTY720 (which is phosphorylated by SK2 to FTY720 phosphate) and FTY720 phosphate, which is an agonist at S1P1,3,4,5 but not S1P2 and which stimulated activation of ERK-1/2 in MDA-MB-453 cells (Fig. 4f). Finally, we used phyto-S1P, which is an agonist at S1P4 (30Inagaki Y. Pham T.T. Fujiwara Y. Kohno T. Osborne D.A. Igarashi Y. Tigyi G. Parrill A.L. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and demonstrated that this agent also induced activation of ERK-1/2 (Fig. 4g), which was reduced by siRNA knockdown of S1P4 (Fig. 4g), but not S1P2 (Fig. 4e). S1P4 knockdown was more effective against phyto-S1P compared with S1P. This apparent anomaly might be explained by a model in which there is higher fractional receptor occupancy with phyto-S1P compared with S1P for ERK-1/2 activation and where efficacy for each phyto-S1P-bound S1P4 receptor is less than for each S1P-bound S1P4 receptor. We conclude that S1P4 mediates the effect of S1P on ERK-1/2 activation in MDA-MB-453 cells. Evidence that a functional interaction occurs between S1P and HER2 was obtained by the finding that S1P but not EGF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2, and this was severely reduced by JTE013 (Fig. 5, a and b). Evidence for the involvement of HER2 in regulating S1P4 signaling to the ERK-1/2 pathway was demonstrated by results showing that siRNA knockdown HER2 expression reduced S1P-stimulation of ERK-1/2 by ∼50% compared with cells treated with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 6, a and b). The incomplete reduction in ERK-1/2 activation might be due to residual HER2 expression after siRNA treatment. To confirm data obtained by Western blotting with antiphospho-ERK-1/2 antibody, we immunoprecipitated ERK-1/2 with anti-ERK-1/2 antibody and measured ERK-1/2 activity against MBP in the immunoprecipitates. This assay confirmed that S1P or EGF stimulated ERK-1/2 activity (Fig. 6a). Moreover, siRNA knockdown of HER2 reduced the stimulation of ERK-1/2 activity by S1P and had no effect on the response to EGF (Fig. 6a). HER2 siRNA had no effect on cell integrity as assessed using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Fig. 6a). We also used the HER2 inhibitor, ErbB2 inhibitor II (4-(3-phenoxyphenyl)-5-cyano-2H-1,2,3-triazole), which is a cell-permeable HER2 ATP binding kinase inhibitor and reduces phosphorylation of HER2 in MDA-MB-453 cells but not that of an overexpressed EGF receptor in MDA-MB-468 cells, even at concentrations as high as 100 μm (31Cheng Z.Y. Li W.J. He F. Zhou J.M. Zhu X.F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2007; 15: 1533-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The inhibitor was discovered from a computer-aided drug design approach and searched from molecule libraries. Modeling has also been used to demonstrate binding of the inhibitor in the HER2 ATP binding site (31Cheng Z.Y. Li W.J. He F. Zhou J.M. Zhu X.F. Bioorg. Med.

https://openalex.org/W2020932787,"Asthmatic airway smooth muscle (ASM) expresses interferon-γ-inducible protein-10 (CXCL10), a chemokine known to mediate mast cell migration into ASM bundles that has been reported in the airways of asthmatic patients. CXCL10 is elevated in patients suffering from viral exacerbations of asthma and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diseases in which corticosteroids are largely ineffective. IFNγ and TNFα synergistically induce CXCL10 release from human ASM cells in a steroid-insensitive manner, via an as yet undefined mechanism. We report that TNFα activates the classical NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) pathway, whereas IFNγ activates JAK2/STAT-1α and that inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway is more effective in abrogating CXCL10 release than the steroid fluticasone. The synergy observed with TNFα and IFNγ together, however, did not lie at the level of NF-κB activation, STAT-1α phosphorylation, or in vivo binding of these transcription factors to the CXCL10 promoter. Stimulation of human ASM cells with TNFα and IFNγ induced histone H4 but not histone H3 acetylation at the CXCL10 promoter, although no synergism was observed when both cytokines were combined. We show, however, that TNFα and IFNγ exert a synergistic effect on the recruitment of CREB-binding protein (CBP) to the CXCL10, which is accompanied by increased RNA polymerase II. Our results provide evidence that synergism between TNFα and IFNγ lies at the level of coactivator recruitment in human ASM and suggest that inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling may be of therapeutic benefit in steroid-resistant airway disease.

Additionally, viral exacerbations of asthma are a major cause of morbidity and mortality associated with asthma and are relatively unresponsive to steroids (1Johnston N.W. Johnston S.L. Duncan J.M.

CXCL10 is elevated in the airways of asthmatic patients and has been implicated in mast cell migration to the ASM bundles (3Bradding P. Brightling C. Respir.

CXCL10 also is elevated in the bronchial mucosa and broncho alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of subjects with moderate/severe asthma, which is largely steroid-resistant (4Ying S. O'Connor B. Ratoff J.

Given the heightened cytokine milieu observed in severe asthma and COPD, understanding the mechanism for this increase clearly is a central question to address and requires an understanding of the mechanisms involved in transcription and translation of inflammatory products by ASM cells.Transcriptional regulation involves transcription factors binding to recognition sequences in gene promoters (17Stocks J.

In quiescent cells, DNA is packaged tightly in chromatin, which must unravel to allow access of basal transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. Chromatin consists of four core histones, an H3-H4 tetramer and two H2A-H2B dimers that undergo covalent modifications (acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation), which control the unraveling process and thereby gene transcription (20Wolffe A.P.

Our previous studies of CCL11 and CXCL8 have identified important transcription factors for these genes and, moreover, identified histone H4 acetylation as a key event in inflammatory gene transcription (18Nie M.

One study by Hardaker and colleagues (6Hardaker E.L. Bacon A.M. Carlson K. Roshak A.K. Foley J.J. Schmidt D.B. Buckley P.T. Comegys M. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Sarau H.M. Belmonte K.E.

This study also highlighted a synergistic interaction between TNFα and IFNγ on CXCL10 release but did not explore the mechanism involved. TNFα also has been reported to cooperate with IFNγ to synergistically induce CCL5 (26John M. Hirst S.J. Jose P.J. Robichaud A. Berkman N. Witt C. Twort C.H. Barnes P.J. Chung K.F. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1841-1847PubMed Google Scholar), CX3CL1 (fractalkine, 27Sukkar M.B. Issa R. Xie S. Oltmanns U. Newton R. Chung K.F. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol.

Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), although here, too, the underlying mechanisms are unclear.Other potentially important transcription factors involved in CXCL10 regulation by IFNγ are STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription). STATs are a family of latent cytoplasmic proteins that are activated when cells encounter various extracellular polypeptides, such as interferons and interleukins (29Heim M.H. Moradpour D. Blum H.E. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8469-8475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and appear to be essential for responsiveness to IFNα and IFNγ (30Durbin J.E. Hackenmiller R. Simon M.C. Levy D.E.

Ohmori and colleagues (32Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5235-5244PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the frequently observed synergy between TNFα and IFNγ depends in part upon cooperation between STAT-1α and NF-κB in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and is likely mediated by their independent interaction with one or more components of the basal transcription complex. However, the authors but did not explore this possibility experimentally. IFNγ alone, or in combination with TNFα, also has been reported to involve p48, a transcription factor that complexes with STAT-1α and binds to interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) sites on the promoter. Induction of CXCL10 by TNFα/IFNγ also required NF-κB binding sites that bound p65 homodimeric NF-κB (15Majumder S. Zhou L.Z. Chaturvedi P. Babcock G. Aras S. Ransohoff R.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4736-4744PubMed Google Scholar, 16Majumder S. Zhou L.Z. Chaturvedi P. Babcock G. Aras S. Ransohoff R.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The aim of the present study was to characterize the transcription factors, histone modifications, and RNA polymerase II recruitment to the CXCL10 promoter to determine at which point of regulation synergism can be explained between TNFα and IFNγ. We show that TNFα activates the classical NF-κB pathway, IFNγ signals via STAT-1, and their synergism on CXCL10 gene induction is due not to their effects on transcription factor activation or histone modification, but rather a direct effect on the recruitment of the transcriptional coactivator CBP and RNA polymerase II. We also demonstrate that inhibition of the janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling pathway may be a novel approach to targeting steroid-resistant inflammatory lung disease. This is the first observation in primary airway cells and could highlight a novel anti-inflammatory therapy for the treatment of airway inflammation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and PlasmidsPolyclonal anti-human pJAK1, pJAK2, pSTAT-1α, STAT-1α, and RNA polymerase II antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology; anti-human p65 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; acetylated histone H3 and H4 was from Upstate Biotech, Inc.; JAK inhibitor 1 was from Calbiochem; recombinant human IFNγ and TNFα were from R&D Systems (Abingdon, Oxon, UK); MB120L and fluticasone propionate were kind gifts from GlaxoSmithKline; FuGENE 6 was from Roche Applied Science; the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system, Renilla luciferase pRL-SV40 was from Promega; SYBR Green and Excite Master Mix for real-time PCR was from Biogene; primers were from MWG Biotech; ChIP-IT kits were from Active Motif; human and murine CXCL10 ELISA duosets and human and murine recombinant IFNγ and TNFα were from R&D Systems.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Newton (University of Calgary). The CXCL10 promoter-driven luciferase, mutation and deletion constructs has been described previously (34Spurrell J.C. Wiehler S. Zaheer R.S. Sanders S.P. Proud D. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2005; 289: L85-L95Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In all experiments, empty vector experiments were performed, which had little or no significant effect on luciferase activity (data not shown).Cell CultureHuman tracheas were obtained from three to six post-mortem individuals. Primary cultures of human ASM cells were prepared from explants of ASM according to methods reported previously (25Clarke D.L. Sutcliffe A. Deacon K. Bradbury D. Corbett L. Knox A.J. J.

This protocol was approved by the Nottingham City Hospital Research Ethics Committee. Cells at passages 6–7 were used for all experiments. We have shown previously that cells grown in this manner have the immunohistochemical and light microscopic characteristics of typical ASM cells.Experimental ProtocolHASM cells were cultured to confluence in either six-well plates for Western blotting experiments or 24-well culture plates for other all experiments in a humidified, 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Seralab, Crawly Down, Sussex, UK), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 4 mm l-glutamine, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B (Sigma). The cells were growth-arrested in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to experiments. Immediately before each experiment, fresh serum-free medium containing cytokine or relevant vehicle was added. In concentration response experiments, cells were incubated for 24 h with 0.001–100 ng/ml TNFα or IFNγ. When cytokines were used in combination cells were stimulated with submaximal concentrations of each cytokine (0.1 ng/ml TNFα and 10 ng/ml IFNγ). Chemical inhibitors and steroids were incubated for 30–60 min before cytokine exposure as indicated in the figure legend. At the indicated times, the culture media were harvested and stored at −20 °C for subsequent ELISAs.CXCL10 AssayThe enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure CXCL10 (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions.RNA Isolation and Reverse TranscriptionCells in six-well plates were treated with cytokines and collected at times indicated in the text. Total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) following the manufacturer's protocol with on-column DNase digestion. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed in a total volume of 20 μl including 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI), 25 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega), 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)15 primer, 0.5 mm each dNTPs, and 1× first-strand buffer provided by Promega. The reaction was incubated at 42 °C for 90 min.Quantitative Real-time RT-PCRCXCL10 expression was determined using the following primer sequences: sense, 5′-GAAATTATTCCTGCAAGCCAATTT-3′ and antisense, 5′-TCACCCTTCTTTTTCATGTAGCA-3′ (34Spurrell J.C. Wiehler S. Zaheer R.S. Sanders S.P. Proud D. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2005; 289: L85-L95Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). β2-Microglobulin was used validated for use in this assay and used as the housekeeping gene. 1 ng of reverse-transcribed cDNA was subjected to real-time PCR using Excite Real-time Mastermix with SYBR Green (Biogene, Cambridge, UK) and the ABI Prism 7700 detection system (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK) as described previously (25Clarke D.L. Sutcliffe A. Deacon K. Bradbury D. Corbett L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 3503-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). CXCL10 expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene by dividing the mean of the CXCL10 triplicate value by the mean of the β2-microglobulin triplicate value. This was then expressed as fold increase over nonstimulated cells at each time point.Western Blot AnalysisHASM cells were treated for times indicated in the text, cells were washed, and proteins were extracted as described previously (25Clarke D.L. Sutcliffe A. Deacon K. Bradbury D. Corbett L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 3503-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Anti-human pSTAT-1, total STAT-1, or pJAK1 and pJAK2 polyclonal antibody were used at 1:1,000 dilution.CXCL10 mRNA StabilitySerum-starved HASM cells were treated with or without TNFα (1 ng/ml), IFNγ (100 ng/ml), or TNFα (0.1 ng/ml) and IFNγ (10 ng/ml) in combination for 3 h before the addition of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) for the times indicated to block new transcript generation. RNA was extracted and quantitative real-time RT-PCR of CXCL10 expression was measured as detailed above.Transient Transfection of CXCL10 Promoter-driven Luciferase ConstructsAll transient transfections were conducted by using FuGENE 6 according to the recommended protocol of the manufacturer and as described previously (25Clarke D.L. Sutcliffe A. Deacon K. Bradbury D. Corbett L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 3503-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A 1:3 ratio was used; 0.4 μg/well plasmid per 1.2 μl FuGENE 6, together with 0.8 ng/well of Renilla luciferase reporter/well as an internal control. Relative luciferase activity was obtained by normalizing the firefly luciferase activity against the internal control Renilla luciferase activity. The fold increase was obtained by comparing relative luciferase activity from experiment groups against that from their respective controls. Data are expressed as fold difference, as little and no significant difference was seen in baseline levels observed between each construct when nonstimulated (data not shown). The transfection rate was between 25 and 30% as measured by transfection with a green fluorescent protein expression vector.Chromatin Immunoprecipiation Assay (ChIP)HASM cells were cultured to confluence in T75 cm2 flasks, growth arrested, and incubated with media or cytokines for 60 min. The ChIP assay was performed using the ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium) following the manufacturer's protocol and as described previously (25Clarke D.L. Sutcliffe A. Deacon K. Bradbury D. Corbett L. Knox A.J. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 3503-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 4 μg of antibody or IgG control was used for each immunoprecipitation and stimulation parameter. IgG binding control levels did not chance significantly from nonstimulated levels for each antibody tested indicating specificity of antibodies used (data not shown). The CXCL10 primers used yielded a 134-bp product corresponding to −224 to −90 of the CXCL10 gene promoter and were as follows: forward, 5′-TTTGGAAAGTGAAACCTAATTCA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CAGGAACAGCCAGCAGGTTTT-3′.Cell ViabilityDrug and vehicles toxicity was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, as described previously (35Clarke D.L. Belvisi M.G. Catley M.C. Yacoub M.H. Newton R. Giembycz M.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 141: 1141-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). None of the drugs/vehicles altered cell viability (data not shown).Statistical AnalysisTo determine whether there was synergy between TNFα and IFNγ, the sum of TNFα (0.1 ng/ml) and IFNγ (10 ng/ml) alone was compared with TNFα and IFNγ, Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to determine differences, and a p value ≤ 0.05 was assumed to be significant. For all other experiments, statistical analysis was performed on the absolute data using a t test with a Mann-Whitney posttest for single comparisons and a Kruskal-Wallis test with a Dunn's post-test for multiple comparisons. A plus sign (+) represents a significant (p < 0.05) differences from the nonstimulated control group; and the number sign represents a significant (p < 0.05) difference from stimulated control group.RESULTSTNFα and IFNγ Synergistically and Transcriptionally Induce CXCL10 Release and mRNAIn the absence of stimulus, HASM cells released an undetectable amount of CXCL10. TNFα and IFNγ (0.01–100 ng/ml for 24 h) concentration-dependently increased CXCL10 release from HASM cells (from 0 to 6886.3 ± 2403.3 pg/ml for TNFα and 248.7 ± 65.2 pg/ml for IFNγ each at 100 ng/ml; n = 3) (Fig. 1A). In all further experiments, CXCL10 release was stimulated using 1 ng/ml TNFα and 100 ng/ml IFNγ.To explore synergy between TNFα and IFNγ, submaximal concentrations of each cytokine were chosen (10 ng/ml IFNγ and 0.1 ng/ml TNFα) to ensure that cytokine release was not supramaximal and could be modulated by pharmacological inhibitors in future experiments. Using these concentrations, IFNγ induced 61.9 ± 29.2 pg/ml, and TNFα induced 567.3 ± 197.5 pg/ml CXCL10. However, addition of these cytokines together synergistically induced CXCL10, inducing 19,920.9 ± 3454.8 pg/ml (Fig. 1A).These experiments were mirrored at the level of mRNA. After a 6-h stimulation, TNFα (1 ng/ml) and IFNγ (100 ng/ml) increased CXCL10 mRNA from 0 to 0.42 ± 0.14 and 0.096 ± 0.02, respectively. Synergy also was observed at the mRNA level as the mRNA level increased to 1.44 ± 0.07 in the presence of both cytokines (10 ng/ml IFNγ and 0.1 ng/ml TNFα; Fig. 1B, n = 3). Actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) addition indicated that the increase in CXCL10 mRNA observed was mediated transcriptionally (Fig. 1B).TNFα and IFNγ Do Not Regulate CXCL10 via Post-transcriptional MechanismsRegulation of CXCL10 has been reported previously to be mediated via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (38Dhillon N.K. Peng F. Ransohoff R.M. Buch S. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 2722-2730Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); therefore, we investigated whether costimulation with TNFα and IFNγ affect CXCL10 mRNA stability. As can be seen in Fig. 1C, CXCL10 decay over time was not affected by TNFα or IFNγ alone, or when cells were costimulated with these cytokines, indicating post-transcriptional regulation does not play a role in this pathway. These data support that shown in Fig. 1B suggesting CXCL10 is regulated transcriptionally under these experimental conditions.TNFα and IFNγ Synergistically Enhance CXCL10 Promoter ActivityTNFα (1 ng/ml) and IFNγ (100 ng/ml) increased luciferase activity 2.5 ± 0.2-fold and 4.5 ± 0.8-fold, respectively (Fig. 1D). To determine whether synergism also exists at the promoter level, transfected cells were stimulated with TNFα and IFNγ together (0.1 ng/ml TNFα plus 10 ng/ml IFNγ). This resulted in a 13.4 ± 3.4-fold increase in promoter activity, confirming that synergy lies at the transcriptional level (Fig. 1D).TNFα- and IFNγ-induced CXCL10 Release Is Steroid-insensitiveTo determine whether cytokine-induced CXCL10 release is steroid-sensitive, we tested the corticosteroid fluticasone. TNFα-induced CXCL10 release was concentration-dependently inhibited by fluticasone (from 1811.6 ± 252.2 pg/ml using 1 ng/ml TNFα to 62.3 ± 31.9 pg/ml using 10−6 m fluticasone; 96.5 ± 1.9% inhibition; Fig. 2A). IFNγ-induced CXCL10 was less sensitive to a steroid, with the highest concentration of fluticasone inhibiting CXCL10 release by 30.6 ± 6.8% (from 535.5 ± 19.8 pg/ml to 369.6 ± 29.8 pg/ml; Fig. 2B). In keeping with data published previously (28Tliba O. Cidlowski J.A. Amrani Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 588-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 39Tliba O. Tliba S. Da Huang C.

Preliminary data in our groups also showed that other CC and CXC T cell chemokines such as CXCL11 and CXCL9, which are induced synergistically by IFNγ and TNFα, exhibited the same pattern of steroid sensitivity as CXCL10. Indeed, TNFα-induced ITAC and MIG mRNAs were steroid-sensitive, whereas IFNγ or IFNγ and TNFα combined induced a steroid-insensitive response. RANTES was induced by TNFα only in a steroid-sensitive manner (data not shown). Given the functional implications of the lack of effectiveness of steroids in severe disease where the cytokine milieu is heightened, we wanted to determine which signaling pathways were activated by TNFα and IFNγ to induce CXCL10 release with the aim to highlight novel therapeutics for the treatment of steroid-resistant disease.FIGURE 2Effect of the steroid fluticasone on cytokine-induced CXCL10 release HASM cells grown on 96-well plates were growth arrested for 24 h and pretreated for 60 min with fluticasone (10−11 to 10−6 m) before stimulation with TNFα (1 ng/ml) (A), or IFNγ (100 ng/ml) (B), or both cytokines in combination (0.1 ng/ml TNFα and 10 ng/ml IFNγ) (C) for 24 h.

https://openalex.org/W2027602112,"Background This is the first study to experimentally explore the direct relationship between circulating VEGF levels and body mass index (BMI) as well as to unravel the role of insulin sensitivity in this context under standardized glucose clamp conditions as the methodical gold-standard. In order to control for known influencing factors such as gender, medication, and arterial hypertension, we examined a highly homogeneous group of young male subjects. Moreover, to encompass also subjects beyond the normal BMI range, low weight and obese participants were additionally included and stress hormones as a main regulator of VEGF were assessed. Methodology/Principal Findings Under euglycemic clamp conditions, VEGF was measured in 15 normal weight (BMI 20–25 kg/m2), 15 low weight (BMI<20 kg/m2), and 15 obese (BMI>30 kg/m2) male subjects aged 18–30 years and the insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was calculated. Since stress axis activation promotes VEGF secretion, concentrations of ACTH, cortisol, and catecholamines were monitored. Despite of comparable ACTH (P = 0.145), cortisol (P = 0.840), and norepinephrine (P = 0.065) levels, VEGF concentrations differed significantly between BMI-groups (P = 0.008) with higher concentrations in obese subjects as compared to normal weight (P = 0.061) and low weight subjects (P = 0.002). Pearson's correlation analysis revealed a positive relationship between BMI and VEGF levels (r = 0.407; P = 0.010) but no correlation of VEGF with ISI (r = 0.224; P = 0.175). Conclusions/Significance Our data demonstrate a positive correlation between concentrations of circulating VEGF levels and BMI in healthy male subjects under highly controlled conditions. This relationship which is apparently disconnected from insulin sensitivity may be part of some pathogenetic mechanisms underlying obesity and type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2107061183,"Background Abnormal DNA methylation is well established for breast cancer and contributes to its progression by silencing tumor suppressor genes. DNA methylation profiling platforms might provide an alternative approach to expression microarrays for accurate breast tumor subtyping. We sought to determine whether the distinction of the inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) phenotype from the non-IBC phenotype by transcriptomics could be sustained by methylomics. Methodology/Principal Findings We performed methylation profiling on a cohort of IBC (N = 19) and non-IBC (N = 43) samples using the Illumina Infinium Methylation Assay. These results were correlated with gene expression profiles. Methylation values allowed separation of breast tumor samples into high and low methylation groups. This separation was significantly related to DNMT3B mRNA levels. The high methylation group was enriched for breast tumor samples from patients with distant metastasis and poor prognosis, as predicted by the 70-gene prognostic signature. Furthermore, this tumor group tended to be enriched for IBC samples (54% vs. 24%) and samples with a high genomic grade index (67% vs. 38%). A set of 16 CpG loci (14 genes) correctly classified 97% of samples into the low or high methylation group. Differentially methylated genes appeared to be mainly related to focal adhesion, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, Wnt signaling pathway, chemokine signaling pathways and metabolic processes. Comparison of IBC with non-IBC led to the identification of only four differentially methylated genes (TJP3, MOGAT2, NTSR2 and AGT). A significant correlation between methylation values and gene expression was shown for 4,981 of 6,605 (75%) genes. Conclusions/Significance A subset of clinical samples of breast cancer was characterized by high methylation levels, which coincided with increased DNMT3B expression. Furthermore, an association was observed with molecular signatures indicative of poor patient prognosis. The results of the current study also suggest that aberrant DNA methylation is not the main force driving the molecular biology of IBC."
https://openalex.org/W2091489434,"MyD88 is an essential adaptor molecule for Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor. MyD88 is thought to be present as condensed forms or aggregated structures in the cytoplasm, although the reason has not yet been clear. Here, we show that endogenous MyD88 is present as small speckle-like condensed structures, formation of which depends on MyD88 dimerization. In addition, formation of large aggregated structures is related to cytoplasmic accumulation of sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1; also known as p62) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which are involved in accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins. A gene knockdown study revealed that SQSTM1 and HDAC6 were required for MyD88 aggregation and exhibited a suppressive effect on TLR ligand-induced expression of IL-6 and NOS2 in RAW264.7 cells. SQSTM1 and HDAC6 were partially involved in suppression of several TLR4-mediated signaling events, including activation of p38 and JNK, but they hardly affected degradation of IκBα (inhibitor of nuclear factor κB). Biochemical induction of MyD88 oligomerization induced recruitment of SQSTM1 and HDAC6 to the MyD88-TRAF6 signaling complex. Repression of SQSTM1 and HDAC6 enhanced formation of the MyD88-TRAF6 complex and conversely decreased interaction of the ubiquitin-specific negative regulator CYLD with the complex. Furthermore, ubiquitin-binding regions on SQSTM1 and HDAC6 were essential for MyD88 aggregation but were not required for interaction with the MyD88 complex. Thus, our study reveals not only that SQSTM1 and HDAC6 are important determinants of aggregated localization of MyD88 but also that MyD88 activates a machinery of polyubiquitinated protein accumulation that has a modulatory effect on MyD88-dependent signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2022553568,"Calcium signaling is a key regulator of pathways important in tumor progression, such as proliferation and apoptosis. Most studies assessing altered calcium homeostasis in cancer cells have focused on alterations mediated through changes in cytoplasmic free calcium levels. Here, we show that basal-like breast cancers are characterized by an alteration in the secretory pathway calcium ATPase 1 (SPCA1), a calcium pump localized to the Golgi. Inhibition of SPCA1 in MDA-MB-231 cells produced pronounced changes in cell proliferation and morphology in three-dimensional culture, without alterations in sensitivity to endoplasmic reticulum stress induction or changes in global calcium signaling. Instead, the effects of SPCA1 inhibition in MDA-MB-231 cells reside in altered regulation of calcium-dependent enzymes located in the secretory pathway, such as proprotein convertases. Inhibition of SPCA1 produced a pronounced alteration in the processing of insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R), with significantly reduced levels of functional IGF1Rβ and accumulation of the inactive trans-Golgi network pro-IGF1R form. These studies identify for the first time a calcium transporter associated with the basal-like breast cancer subtype. The pronounced effects of SPCA1 inhibition on the processing of IGF1R in MDA-MB-231 cells independent of alterations in global calcium signaling also demonstrate that some calcium transporters can regulate the processing of proteins important in tumor progression without major alterations in cytosolic calcium signaling. Inhibitors of SPCA1 may offer an alternative strategy to direct inhibitors of IGF1R and attenuate the processing of other proprotein convertase substrates important in basal breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2079562074,"Met, the high affinity receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, is one of the most frequently activated tyrosine kinases in human cancer and a validated target for cancer therapy. We previously developed a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular portion of Met (DN-30) that induces Met proteolytic cleavage (receptor “shedding”) followed by proteasome-mediated receptor degradation. This translates into inhibition of hepatocyte growth factor/Met-mediated biological activities. However, DN-30 binding to Met also results in partial activation of the Met kinase due to antibody-mediated receptor homodimerization. To safely harness the therapeutic potential of DN-30, its shedding activity must be disassociated from its agonistic activity. Here we show that the DN-30 Fab fragment maintains high affinity Met binding, elicits efficient receptor shedding and down-regulation, and does not promote kinase activation. In Met-addicted tumor cell lines, DN-30 Fab displays potent cytostatic and cytotoxic activity in a dose-dependent fashion. DN-30 Fab also inhibits anchorage-independent growth of several tumor cell lines. In mouse tumorigenesis assays using Met-addicted carcinoma cells, intratumor administration of DN-30 Fab or systemic delivery of a chemically stabilized form of the same molecule results in reduction of Met phosphorylation and inhibition of tumor growth. These data provide proof of concept that monovalency unleashes the full therapeutic potential of the DN-30 antibody and point at DN-30 Fab as a promising tool for Met-targeted therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2016235886,"The polyubiquitin chain is generated by the sequential addition of ubiquitin moieties to target molecules, a reaction between specific lysine residues that is catalyzed by E3 ubiquitin ligase. The Lys(48)-linked and Lys(63)-linked polyubiquitin chains are well established inducers of proteasome-dependent degradation and signal transduction, respectively. The concept has recently emerged that polyubiquitin chain-mediated regulation is even more complex because various types of atypical polyubiquitin chains have been discovered in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that a novel complex ubiquitin chain functions as an internalization signal for major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) membrane proteins in vivo. Using a tetracycline-inducible expression system and quantitative mass spectrometry, we show that the polyubiquitin chain generated by the viral E3 ubiquitin ligase of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, MIR2, is a Lys(11) and Lys(63) mixed-linkage chain. This novel ubiquitin chain can function as an internalization signal for MHC I through its association with epsin1, an adaptor molecule containing ubiquitin-interacting motifs."

This study aims at determining whether B(1)R activation could perpetuate the oxidative stress which leads to diabetic complications.Young Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with 10% D-Glucose or tap water (controls) for 8-12 weeks. A selective B(1)R antagonist (SSR240612) was administered acutely (3-30 mg/kg) or daily for a period of 7 days (10 mg/kg) and the impact was measured on systolic blood pressure, allodynia, protein and/or mRNA B(1)R expression, aortic superoxide anion (O(2)(*-)) production and expression of superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and catalase. SSR240612 reduced dose-dependently (3-30 mg/kg) high blood pressure in 12-week glucose-fed rats, but had no effect in controls. Eight-week glucose-fed rats exhibited insulin resistance (HOMA index), hypertension, tactile and cold allodynia and significant increases of plasma levels of glucose and insulin. This was associated with higher aortic levels of O(2)(*-), NADPH oxidase activity, MnSOD and catalase expression. All these abnormalities including B(1)R overexpression (spinal cord, aorta, liver and gastrocnemius muscle) were normalized by the prolonged treatment with SSR240612. The production of O(2)(*-) in the aorta of glucose-fed rats was also measured in the presence and absence of inhibitors (10-100 microM) of NADPH oxidase (apocynin), xanthine oxidase (allopurinol) or nitric oxide synthase (L-NAME) with and without Sar[D-Phe(8)]des-Arg(9)-BK (20 microM; B(1)R agonist). Data show that the greater aortic O(2)(*-) production induced by the B(1)R agonist was blocked only by apocynin.Activation of kinin B(1)R increased O(2)(*-) through the activation of NADPH oxidase in the vasculature. Prolonged blockade of B(1)R restored cardiovascular, sensory and metabolic abnormalities by reducing oxidative stress and B(1)R gene expression in this model."
https://openalex.org/W2162495597,"Some organisms are able to survive the loss of almost all their body water content, entering a latent state known as anhydrobiosis.

A third major feature is the predicted increase in trehalose synthesis and in the expression of various transporter proteins allowing the distribution of trehalose and other solutes to all tissues. IntroductionWater is essential for life, and terrestrial organisms have developed various strategies to avoid water loss, which would ultimately be fatal. Small organisms are particularly sensitive to desiccation due to their relatively large body-surface-to-volume ratio (1Danks H.V. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 837-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2Gibbs A.G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2002; 133: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Under extreme conditions, such as drought or in arid environments, animals may avoid desiccation in a behavioral manner (by migration or burying deeply in the soil) or physiologically (by entering into diapause, or estivation). Some aquatic insects, which can resist moderate desiccation, secrete a thick cuticle, thus limiting the rate of water loss (3Suemoto T. Kawai K. Imabayashi H. Hydrobiologia. 2004; 57: 107-114Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Nakahara Y. Watanabe M. Fujita A. Kanamori Y. Tanaka D. Iwata K. Furuki T. Sakurai M. Kikawada T. Okuda T. J. Insect Physiol. 2008; 54: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Alternatively, various organisms have developed the opposite strategy; they allow water loss relatively easily but are able to survive essentially complete desiccation (4Nakahara Y. Watanabe M. Fujita A. Kanamori Y. Tanaka D. Iwata K. Furuki T. Sakurai M. Kikawada T. Okuda T. J. Insect Physiol. 2008; 54: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This phenomenon, known as anhydrobiosis, is a specific example of the more general cryptobiosis, which is an ametabolic state induced by various adverse environmental conditions, such as desiccation, low temperature, or lack of oxygen. Cryptobiosis was first defined by Keilin (5Keilin D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1959; 150: 149-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the observation of bdelloid rotifers resurrecting from dry mud samples had already been described in the early 18th century. Anhydrobiosis represents an extreme case of dormancy during which the water content falls to less than 3% of the body weight and no metabolic activity can be detected (6Crowe J.H. Hoekstra F.A. Crowe L.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 579-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 7Watanabe M. Kikawada T. Okuda T. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 2281-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, anhydrobiotic individuals can revive and rapidly resume activity once in contact with water (8Sømme L. Invertebrates in Hot and Cold Arid Environments. Springer-Verlag, New York1995: 95-114Crossref Google Scholar). The most familiar cases of anhydrobiosis are plant seeds or fungal spores, but many microscopic organisms, such as terrestrial tardigrades, bdelloid rotifers, or nematodes, can survive in an anhydrobiotic state (5Keilin D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1959; 150: 149-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sømme L. Invertebrates in Hot and Cold Arid Environments. Springer-Verlag, New York1995: 95-114Crossref Google Scholar, 9Clegg J.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2001; 128: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). For plant seeds or the cysts of some crustacean embryos (Artemia, Triops), anhydrobiosis is only observed in early developmental stages (10Hochachka D.W. Guppy M. Metabolic Arrest and the Control of Biological Time. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts and London1987: 146-165Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, tardigrades and rotifers enter anhydrobiosis also during postembryonic stages in response to environmental change and can experience anhydrobiosis several times successively (11Watanabe M. Kikawada T. Fujita A. Forczek E. Adati T. Okuda T. Eur. J. Entomology. 2004; 101: 439-444Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Ricci C. Hydrobiologia. 2001; 446/447: 1-11Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This is also the case for the sleeping chironomid (Polypedilum vanderplanki), the largest anhydrobiotic animal known to date. However, in P. vanderplanki, only the larval stages are able to enter anhydrobiosis; the other stages (eggs, pupae, adults) last only a couple of days, and such a rapid development is more adapted to a strategy of desiccation avoidance.P. vanderplanki lives in small temporary rock pools in the semi-arid regions of the African continent (13Hinton H.E. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond. 1951; 121: 371-380Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Its larvae are found in small tubular nests in the mud at the bottom of pools, and when the water dries up, they can survive in an almost completely desiccated anhydrobiotic state throughout the dry season, which may last up to 8 months (14Hinton H.E. J. Insect Physiol. 1960; 5: 286-300Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Kikawada T. Minakawa N. Watanabe M. Okuda T. Integ. Comp. Biol. 2005; 45: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To achieve successful anhydrobiosis, P. vanderplanki larvae need an appropriate desiccation rate and, experimentally, at least 2 days are required for the necessary physiological adjustments; appropriate conditions for successful anhydrobiosis have been reproduced in the laboratory (4Nakahara Y. Watanabe M. Fujita A. Kanamori Y. Tanaka D. Iwata K. Furuki T. Sakurai M. Kikawada T. Okuda T. J. Insect Physiol. 2008; 54: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Watanabe M.

Biol. 2005; 45: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Viably desiccated larvae will recover normal activity within 1 h of contact with water (see Fig. 1). The mechanism of anhydrobiosis induction in P. vanderplanki was found to be independent of any control by the central nervous system or endocrine influence (16Watanabe M. Kikawada T. Minagawa N. Yukuhiro F. Okuda T. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 2799-2802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and salt concentration apparently plays an important role in the induction of this phenomenon (7Watanabe M. Kikawada T. Okuda T. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 2281-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, anhydrobiosis can even be successfully induced in isolated fat body tissue (17Watanabe M. Kikawada T. Fujita A. Okuda T. J. Insect Physiol. 2005; 51: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As observed in many other anhydrobionts (18Madin K.A. Crowe J.H. J. Exp. Zool. 1975; 193: 335-342Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 19Crowe L.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2002; 131: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 20Clegg J.S. Campagna V. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 145: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with the exception of bdelloid rotifers and some tardigrades (21Hengherr S.

Hydrobiologia. 2005; 546: 315-321Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the accumulation of trehalose in the tissues of P. vanderplanki has a central protective role against desiccation stress, and the induction period of 2 days leading up to successful anhydrobiosis is thus necessary for appropriate levels of trehalose accumulation in the larval body (7Watanabe M.

During this induction phase, trehalose is thought first to act as a water replacement molecule and then to form a glassy matrix, which protects cells and their biomolecules against desiccation stress (23Sakurai M. Furuki T. Akao K. Tanaka D. Nakahara Y. Kikawada T. Watanabe M. Okuda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5093-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Apart from the important role of trehalose, the molecular mechanisms of anhydrobiosis are still poorly understood. Molecular studies led to the identification in nematodes and in a rotifer of proteins related to desiccation tolerance, called late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) 4The abbreviations used are: LEAlate embryogenesis abundantESTexpressed sequence tagHspheat shock proteinROSreactive oxygen species. proteins, which were originally known only in plants (22Tunnacliffe A.

Anhydrobiosis-related gene expression has been also investigated in a brine shrimp (26Qiu Z. Tsoi S.C. MacRae T.H. Mech. Dev. 2007; 124: 856-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Chen W.H. Ge X. Wang W. Yu J. Hu S. BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and a rotifer species, allowing the identification of desiccation-responsive genes such as LEA proteins, heat shock proteins, and some antioxidants. However, more information about the molecular mechanisms of desiccation resistance is needed to fully understand the anhydrobiosis phenomenon. The construction of an anhydrobiosis-related EST library in P. vanderplanki (see Fig. 1) has already led to the characterization of genes involved in the desiccation tolerance of this chironomid, such as LEA proteins (28Kikawada T. Nakahara Y. Kanamori Y. Iwata K. Watanabe M. McGee B. Tunnacliffe A. Okuda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the trehalose transporter Tret1 (29Kikawada T. Saito A. Kanamori Y. Nakahara Y. Iwata K. Tanaka D. Watanabe M. Okuda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 11585-11590Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), or aquaporins (30Kikawada T. Saito A. Kanamori Y. Fujita M. Snigórska K. Watanabe M. Okuda T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The present work describes the construction and general analysis of this anhydrobiosis-related EST database. Many genes involved in the protection of cellular components and biomolecules, such as chaperone proteins and enzymes governing trehalose metabolism, were found to be up-regulated during the process of desiccation, and the dataset also provides evidence that the response to oxidative stress appears to play a central role in anhydrobiosis. IntroductionWater is essential for life, and terrestrial organisms have developed various strategies to avoid water loss, which would ultimately be fatal. Small organisms are particularly sensitive to desiccation due to their relatively large body-surface-to-volume ratio (1Danks H.V. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 837-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2Gibbs A.G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2002; 133: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Under extreme conditions, such as drought or in arid environments, animals may avoid desiccation in a behavioral manner (by migration or burying deeply in the soil) or physiologically (by entering into diapause, or estivation). Some aquatic insects, which can resist moderate desiccation, secrete a thick cuticle, thus limiting the rate of water loss (3Suemoto T. Kawai K. Imabayashi H. Hydrobiologia. 2004; 57: 107-114Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 4Nakahara Y. Watanabe M. Fujita A. Kanamori Y. Tanaka D. Iwata K. Furuki T. Sakurai M. Kikawada T. Okuda T. J. Insect Physiol. 2008; 54: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Alternatively, various organisms have developed the opposite strategy; they allow water loss relatively easily but are able to survive essentially complete desiccation (4Nakahara Y. Watanabe M. Fujita A. Kanamori Y. Tanaka D. Iwata K. Furuki T. Sakurai M. Kikawada T. Okuda T. J. Insect Physiol. 2008; 54: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This phenomenon, known as anhydrobiosis, is a specific example of the more general cryptobiosis, which is an ametabolic state induced by various adverse environmental conditions, such as desiccation, low temperature, or lack of oxygen. Cryptobiosis was first defined by Keilin (5Keilin D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1959; 150: 149-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the observation of bdelloid rotifers resurrecting from dry mud samples had already been described in the early 18th century. Anhydrobiosis represents an extreme case of dormancy during which the water content falls to less than 3% of the body weight and no metabolic activity can be detected (6Crowe J.H. Hoekstra F.A. Crowe L.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 579-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 7Watanabe M. Kikawada T. Okuda T. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 2281-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, anhydrobiotic individuals can revive and rapidly resume activity once in contact with water (8Sømme L. Invertebrates in Hot and Cold Arid Environments. Springer-Verlag, New York1995: 95-114Crossref Google Scholar). The most familiar cases of anhydrobiosis are plant seeds or fungal spores, but many microscopic organisms, such as terrestrial tardigrades, bdelloid rotifers, or nematodes, can survive in an anhydrobiotic state (5Keilin D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1959; 150: 149-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sømme L. Invertebrates in Hot and Cold Arid Environments. Springer-Verlag, New York1995: 95-114Crossref Google Scholar, 9Clegg J.S. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. 2001; 128: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). For plant seeds or the cysts of some crustacean embryos (Artemia, Triops), anhydrobiosis is only observed in early developmental stages (10Hochachka D.W. Guppy M. Metabolic Arrest and the Control of Biological Time. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts and London1987: 146-165Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, tardigrades and rotifers enter anhydrobiosis also during postembryonic stages in response to environmental change and can experience anhydrobiosis several times successively (11Watanabe M. Kikawada T. Fujita A. Forczek E. Adati T. Okuda T. Eur. J. Entomology. 2004; 101: 439-444Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 12Ricci C. Hydrobiologia. 2001; 446/447: 1-11Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). This is also the case for the sleeping chironomid (Polypedilum vanderplanki), the largest anhydrobiotic animal known to date. However, in P. vanderplanki, only the larval stages are able to enter anhydrobiosis; the other stages (eggs, pupae, adults) last only a couple of days, and such a rapid development is more adapted to a strategy of desiccation avoidance.P. vanderplanki lives in small temporary rock pools in the semi-arid regions of the African continent (13Hinton H.E. Proc. Zool. Soc. Lond. 1951; 121: 371-380Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Its larvae are found in small tubular nests in the mud at the bottom of pools, and when the water dries up, they can survive in an almost completely desiccated anhydrobiotic state throughout the dry season, which may last up to 8 months (14Hinton H.E. J. Insect Physiol. 1960; 5: 286-300Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Kikawada T. Minakawa N. Watanabe M. Okuda T. Integ. Comp. Biol. 2005; 45: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To achieve successful anhydrobiosis, P. vanderplanki larvae need an appropriate desiccation rate and, experimentally, at least 2 days are required for the necessary physiological adjustments; appropriate conditions for successful anhydrobiosis have been reproduced in the laboratory (4Nakahara Y. Watanabe M. Fujita A. Kanamori Y. Tanaka D. Iwata K. Furuki T. Sakurai M. Kikawada T. Okuda T. J. Insect Physiol. 2008; 54: 1220-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 7Watanabe M.

Biol. 2005; 45: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Viably desiccated larvae will recover normal activity within 1 h of contact with water (see Fig. 1). The mechanism of anhydrobiosis induction in P. vanderplanki was found to be independent of any control by the central nervous system or endocrine influence (16Watanabe M. Kikawada T. Minagawa N. Yukuhiro F. Okuda T. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 2799-2802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and salt concentration apparently plays an important role in the induction of this phenomenon (7Watanabe M. Kikawada T. Okuda T. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 2281-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, anhydrobiosis can even be successfully induced in isolated fat body tissue (17Watanabe M. Kikawada T. Fujita A. Okuda T. J. Insect Physiol. 2005; 51: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As observed in many other anhydrobionts (18Madin K.A. Crowe J.H. J. Exp. Zool. 1975; 193: 335-342Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 19Crowe L.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2002; 131: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 20Clegg J.S. Campagna V. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 145: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) with the exception of bdelloid rotifers and some tardigrades (21Hengherr S. Heyer A.G. Köhler H.R. Schill R.O. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Tunnacliffe A. Lapinski J. McGee B. Hydrobiologia. 2005; 546: 315-321Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the accumulation of trehalose in the tissues of P. vanderplanki has a central protective role against desiccation stress, and the induction period of 2 days leading up to successful anhydrobiosis is thus necessary for appropriate levels of trehalose accumulation in the larval body (7Watanabe M.

https://openalex.org/W2149729250,"Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an important component of marine lipids, exhibits anti-inflammatory activity related to some of its oxygenated metabolites, such as neuroprotectin/protectin D1 [NPD1/PD1; 10(R),17(S)-dihydroxy-docosa-4Z,7Z, 11E,13E,15Z,19Z-hexaenoic acid] produced through the 15-lipoxygenase pathway. However, other metabolites from DHA can be produced through this pathway, and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of nutritional value may be oxygenated as well. Their biological activities remain unknown. Isomers of protectin D1 were synthesized using soybean lipoxygenase and tested for their ability to inhibit human blood platelet aggregation. A geometric isomer called PDX, previously described with the 11E,13Z,15E geometry, instead of 11E,13E,15Z in PD1, inhibited platelet aggregation at submicromolar concentrations when induced by either collagen, arachidonic acid, or thromboxane. The inhibition occurred at the level of both the cyclooxygenase activity and thromboxane receptor site. Interestingly, all the metabolites tested exhibiting the E,Z,E-conjugated triene were active, whereas E,E,Z trienes (as in PD1) or all-trans (E,E,E) trienes were inactive. We conclude that PDX and other oxygenated products from PUFAs of nutritional interest, having the E,Z,E-conjugated triene motif and collectively named poxytrins (PUFA oxygenated trienes), might have antithrombotic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2076027733,"Semen was recently shown to contain amyloid fibrils formed from a self-assembling peptide fragment of the protein prostatic acid phosphatase. These amyloid fibrils, termed semen-derived enhancer of virus infection, or SEVI, have been shown to strongly enhance HIV infectivity and may play an important role in sexual transmission of HIV, making them a potential microbicide target. One novel approach to target these fibrils is the use of small molecules known to intercalate into the structure of amyloid fibrils, such as derivatives of thioflavin-T. Here, we show that the amyloid-binding small molecule BTA-EG6 (the hexa(ethylene glycol) derivative of benzothiazole aniline) is able to bind SEVI fibrils and effectively inhibit both SEVI-mediated and semen-mediated enhancement of HIV infection. BTA-EG6 also blocks the interactions of SEVI with HIV-1 virions and HIV-1 target cells but does not cause any inflammation or toxicity to cervical epithelial cells. These results suggest that an amyloid-binding small molecule may have utility as a microbicide, or microbicidal supplement, for HIV-1.

These results suggest that an amyloid-binding small molecule may have utility as a microbicide, or microbicidal supplement, for HIV-1. The global HIV-1 epidemic remains a pressing public health threat nearly 30 years after its identification. The vast majority of cases worldwide are acquired by heterosexual transmission, especially male to female (1Royce R.A. Seña A. Cates Jr., W. Cohen M.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). Therefore, a microbicide that could limit the sexual transmission of HIV might provide an affordable and feasible way to decrease the spread of the virus, especially in developing countries. Recently, Münch et al. (2Münch J. Rücker E. Ständker L. Adermann K. Goffinet C. Schindler M. Wildum S. Chinnadurai R. Rajan D. Specht A. Giménez-Gallego G. Sánchez P.C. Fowler D.M. Koulov A.

These fibrils, which Münch et al. termed the “semen-derived enhancer of virus infection” (SEVI), are highly cationic and enhance infectivity by at least two mechanisms. First, they decrease the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged surface of the virion and the target cell. Second, they bind virions and increase their rate of sedimentation onto the target cell surface, enhancing the likelihood of receptor-mediated viral entry (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J. Kobayashi A. Smith-McCune K. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The effect of SEVI fibrils is greatest with low levels of infectious virus (2Münch J. Rücker E. Ständker L. Adermann K. Goffinet C. Schindler M. Wildum S. Chinnadurai R. Rajan D. Specht A.

Other amyloid fibrils, especially amyloid-β (Aβ), which is associated with Alzheimer disease (5Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5181) Google Scholar), have been well studied as potential therapeutic or diagnostic targets. One approach to target Aβ fibrils is the use of small molecules that bind the fibrils at a high density and thereby sterically inhibit their interactions with proteins (6Inbar P. Li C.Q. Takayama S.A. Bautista M.R. Yang J. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The amyloid imaging agent, thioflavin-T (ThT) is one such molecule. Substituted 2-(4-aminophenyl)benzothiazoles (commonly referred to as “benzothiazole aniline” or BTA) are biocompatible analogues of ThT that bind to an increased number of sites along the Aβ fibril axis (7Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P.N. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Specifically, the hexa(ethylene glycol) derivative of BTA, BTA-EG6, has been shown to bind to Aβ fibrils and to inhibit the interaction of Aβ fibrils with other proteins (6Inbar P. Li C.Q. Takayama S.A. Bautista M.R. Yang J. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8Inbar P. Bautista M.R. Takayama S.A. Yang J. Anal. Chem. 2008; 80: 3502-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ThT and its derivatives are believed to bind to Aβ based on the β-sheet structure that is common to all amyloid fibrils (9Khurana R. Coleman C. Ionescu-Zanetti C. Carter S.A. Krishna V. Grover R.K. Roy R. Singh S. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 151: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the ability of these small molecules to bind to SEVI and interfere with SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity. We show here that BTA-EG6 is able to inhibit both SEVI-mediated and semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity in a dose-dependent fashion while remaining nontoxic to cervical cells. Therefore, BTA-EG6 might be a good candidate for addition to potential microbicide formulations. BTA-EG6 was synthesized as described previously (6Inbar P. Li C.Q. Takayama S.A. Bautista M.R. Yang J. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). CEM-M7 (a gift from N. Landau, New York University, New York, NY) and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). SiHa cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). A2En cells (a gift from S. Greene, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA), and 3EC1 cells (a gift from R. Pyles, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX) were cultured in keratinocyte serum-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with bovine pituitary extract (50 mg/liter), recombinant epidermal growth factor (5 μg/liter), CaCl2 (44.1 mg/liter), and Primocin (0.1 mg/ml). PBMCs were isolated from whole blood by Lymphoprep density gradient centrifugation. PBMCs were stimulated for 48 h in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% human IL-2 (ZeptoMetrix), 5 μg/ml PHA (Sigma), 20% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). PAP248–286 and biotinylated PAP248–286, in which a biotin was added to the amino terminus of the peptide, was synthesized by New England Peptide and dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. Fibrils were formed by agitation in an Eppendorf Thermomixer at 1400 rpm and 37 °C for 72 h. Semen samples were obtained from the Strong Fertility Center (Rochester, NY) and Fairfax CryoBank (Fairfax, VA). Samples were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. 100 μg/ml SEVI was mixed with 16 μg/ml FITC-heparin and concentrations of BTA-EG6 ranging from 0 to 200 μg/ml. Samples were incubated 1 h at room temperature and read on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Envision 2012 multilabel reader at an excitation λ = 480 nm and emission λ = 535 nm. The horizontal and vertical polarized fluorescence intensities were recorded, and the calculated polarization was determined in millipolarization units. Binding of BTA-EG6 to SEVI fibrils was measured according to the centrifugation assay described by Levine (10LeVine 3rd, H. Amyloid. 2005; 12: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) for BTA-1 to Aβ fibrils. Briefly, 200 μl of various concentrations of BTA-EG6 in PBS were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μg of SEVI fibrils to give a final volume of 220 μl of solution. These incubations were performed in duplicate runs and allowed to equilibrate overnight at room temperature. After equilibration, each solution was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were separated from the pelleted fibrils, and 220 μl of fresh PBS was added to resuspend the pellets. A-100 μl aliquot of each resuspended pellet was pipetted into a cuvette (ultra-microcuvette, 10-mm light path, Hellma®, Müllheim, Germany), and the fluorescence of BTA-EG6 was determined at 355 nm excitation and 430 nm emission using a spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Inc., Birmingham, NJ). Error bars represent standard deviations from the mean. The graph was plotted and fitted using the following one-site specific binding algorithm to determine Kd: Y = Bmax ×X/(Kd+X), where X is the concentration of BTA-EG6, Y is the specific binding fluorescence intensity, and Bmax corresponds to the apparent maximal observable fluorescence upon binding of BTA-EG6 to SEVI fibrils. The data were processed using Origin 7.0 (MicroCal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). 105 Jurkat cells were incubated with biotinylated SEVI fibrils (40 μg/ml) with and without BTA-EG6 at a concentration of 10 (low) or 30 μg/ml (high) or heparin (100 μg/ml) as a positive control for interfering with SEVI binding to the cell surface. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and stained for 1 h with a covalent conjugate of streptavidin and fluorescein isothiocyanate (SA-FITC). Cells were washed and run on an Accuri C6 Flow Cytometer. Data were analyzed using FlowJo (TreeStar Inc, Ashland, OR). For infection of CEM-M7 cells, X4 tropic HIV-1IIIB (21 ng/ml p24) or R5 tropic HIV-1ADA (60 ng/ml p24) was pretreated for 10 min at room temperature with 15 μg/ml SEVI in the presence or absence of BTA-EG6. Treated virions were then added to 5 × 104 CEM-M7 cells/well in 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates. After 2 h, the medium axis were replaced. Infection was assayed after 48 h by quantifying luciferase expression using the Promega Dual-Luciferase assay and a Beckman Coulter DTX880 plate reader. For infections using semen, pooled human semen samples were added to virions at a 1:1 dilution and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of BTA-EG6. After 15 min, the semen and virus mixture was diluted 1:15 into 5 × 104 CEM-M7 cells/well in a 96-well plate. Cells were washed after 1 h, and infection was assayed at 48 h as above. For infections of PBMCs, R5 tropic HIV-1BaL preincubated with 15 μg/ml SEVI in the presence or absence of BTA-EG6 was added to 2 × 105 PHA/IL-2-stimulated PBMCs/well in 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates. Cells were washed at 3 h, and infection was analyzed at day 4 using the HIV-1 p24 antigen capture assay (Advanced Bioscience Laboratory). HIV-1 IIIB or ADA virions were pretreated with 15 μg/ml SEVI and added to 5 × 104 Jurkat cells, or A2En cells, in the presence or absence of BTA-EG6. After 90 min, cells were washed to remove any unbound virus, and bound virions were detected using an HIV-1 p24 antigen capture assay (Advanced Bioscience Laboratory). HIV-1 BaL virions were pretreated with 15 μg/ml SEVI and added to 5 × 104 A2En cells in the presence or absence of BTA-EG6. Supernatant was collected at 6 and 24 h, and the production of the chemokines IL-8 and Mip-3α was measured by ELISA (R&D Systems). To assess semen-mediated chemokine production, SiHa cells were treated with semen, as described above, in the presence or absence of BTA-EG6. After 6 h, supernatants were collected, and the production of the chemokines IL-8 and Mip-3α was measured by ELISA (R&D systems). The cervical epithelial cell lines SiHa, A2En (endocervical, data not shown), and 3EC1 (ectocervical, data not shown) were treated for 12 h with BTA-EG6 at concentrations up to 66 μg/ml, 10 times the IC50. After 12 h, cell viability was analyzed by measuring cellular metabolic activity using the resazurin cytotoxicity assay, alamarBlue® (Invitrogen), in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Cytokine and chemokine production was assessed at 12 h by ELISA (R&D systems). Cells were also treated with 0.1% nonoxynol-9 as a positive control for cytotoxicity and with 0.1 μg/ml FSL1, a synthetic diacylated lipoprotein derived from Mycoplasma salivarium (InvivoGen), as a positive control for chemokine production. ThT is able to intercalate into the generic β-sheet structure of amyloid fibrils. The benzothiazole aniline derivative, BTA-EG6, is a ThT analog carrying a hexa(ethylene glycol) moiety (Fig. 1A). This molecule has been previously shown to bind Aβ fibrils and interfere with the ability of Aβ-binding proteins to interact with the fibrils (6Inbar P. Li C.Q. Takayama S.A. Bautista M.R. Yang J. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Based on these interactions with Aβ, we hypothesized that BTA-EG6 might also bind to SEVI fibrils. To test this hypothesis, we used fluorescence polarization to measure the ability of BTA-EG6 to bind SEVI. Increasing concentrations of BTA-EG6 were added to 50 μg/ml SEVI that had been preincubated with 16 μg/ml FITC-heparin, a known SEVI binder (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J. Kobayashi A. Smith-McCune K. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). BTA-EG6 was able to displace fluorescent heparin from the SEVI fibrils in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 1B), suggesting an interaction between these molecules and the fibrils. Having observed an interaction between these molecules, we wanted to more closely assess the binding of BTA-EG6 to SEVI fibrils by quantifying its binding affinity. We therefore used a previously reported fluorescence-based assay (10LeVine 3rd, H. Amyloid. 2005; 12: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) to determine the Kd between BTA-EG6 and the SEVI fibrils. Fig. 1C shows the relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) of BTA-EG6 bound to SEVI fibrils as a function of exposure of the SEVI peptides to increasing concentrations of BTA-EG6. Fitting the data in Fig. 1C with a one-site specific binding algorithm revealed a value of Kd = 127 ± 22 nm (R2 = 0.98). For comparison, we used this same fluorescence binding assay (10LeVine 3rd, H. Amyloid. 2005; 12: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) to measure the affinity of BTA-EG6 for binding to aggregated Alzheimer disease-related Aβ (1–42) peptides, which gave a value of Kd = 111 ± 32 nm (R2 = 0.95, data not shown); this value was similar to the Kd value for binding of BTA-EG6 to SEVI fibrils. To examine whether the interaction of BTA-EG6 with SEVI impacted the stability of the fibrils, preformed SEVI fibrils were incubated with BTA-EG6 for 3 h. After that time, fibrillar structures were examined by ThT fluorescence. ThT changes in fluorescence intensity when intercalated into the β-sheet structure common to amyloid fibrils; therefore, ThT fluorescence serves as a surrogate measure for fibrillar structure of SEVI and for the stability of SEVI fibrils. As seen in Fig. 1D, the addition of BTA-EG6 had no effect on fibrillar stability as measured by ThT. Unlike in the case with ThT, the fluorescence intensity of BTA-EG6 does not change upon binding to amyloid fibrils (10LeVine 3rd, H. Amyloid. 2005; 12: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The intrinsic fluorescence of BTA-EG6, therefore, does not interfere with the analysis of fibril stability using this assay. To further explore the interactions between SEVI fibrils and BTA-EG6, we tested whether binding of this compound to SEVI could inhibit the ability of the fibrils to interact with the negatively charged surface of mammalian cells (2Münch J. Rücker E. Ständker L. Adermann K. Goffinet C. Schindler M. Wildum S. Chinnadurai R. Rajan D. Specht A. Giménez-Gallego G. Sánchez P.C. Fowler D.M. Koulov A. Kelly J.W. Mothes W. Grivel J.C.

Jurkat T-cells were incubated with 35 μg/ml SEVI-biotin fibrils, which were formed by fibrillization of a biotinylated PAP248–286 peptide, in the presence of 5.5 or 13 μg/ml BTA-EG6. Heparin was used as a positive control as this polyanionic compound has been shown to inhibit the binding of SEVI fibrils to the cell surface (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J. Kobayashi A. Smith-McCune K. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Binding of the fibrils to the cell surface was detected using SA-FITC. As seen in Fig. 1E and Table 1, increasing concentrations of BTA-EG6 inhibited the ability of SEVI fibrils to interact with and bind the cell surface, as measured by both the percentage of cells with bound fibrils and the mean fluorescence intensity of the cells.TABLE 1BTA-EG6 binding to SEVI inhibits interaction of SEVI fibrils with the cell surfaceSampleSA-FITC+MFI%Unstained1.6528SEVI-Bio48.12525SEVI-Bio + BTA-EG6 (low)36.695.3SEVI-Bio + BTA-EG6 (high)21.238.7SEVI-Bio + heparin31.7376 Open table in a new tab Having observed that BTA-EG6 was able to inhibit the interaction of SEVI with the cell surface, we investigated whether it could effectively inhibit SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection. CEM-M7 cells were infected with HIV-1 strain IIIB plus 15 μg/ml SEVI fibrils in the presence of increasing concentrations of BTA-EG6. CEM-M7 cells are a CD4+ CCR5+ CXCR4+ T/B cell hybrid cell line and contain HIV LTR-driven luciferase and GFP reporter gene cassettes. The HIV LTR is a weak transcriptional regulator in the absence of its cognate, virally encoded trans-activator, Tat. As a result, luciferase and GFP expression levels in these cells are directly responsive to HIV-1 infection; this property therefore provides a convenient method to determine the extent of viral infection. BTA-EG6 was able to effectively inhibit SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV infection in a dose-dependent fashion, reducing infectivity nearly back to baseline levels (i.e. levels detected in the absence of SEVI) at the highest concentrations tested (Fig. 2A). Importantly, BTA-EG6 had no effect on the infectivity of HIV virus alone, even at the highest concentrations (Fig. 2B), suggesting that this effect was not due to direct inhibition of intrinsic virus infectivity. Because most sexually transmitted HIV-1 infections are the result of R5 viruses (11Pope M. Haase A.T. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we also examined whether the effect of BTA-EG6 extended to a well characterized R5 strain. CEM-M7 cells were infected with HIV-1ADA and 15 μg/ml SEVI, with and without increasing concentrations of BTA-EG6. Once again, BTA-EG6 showed a significant dose-dependent inhibition of SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection (Fig. 2C). No effect on the infectivity of HIV-1ADA was observed in the absence of SEVI (Fig. 2C). We next determined the IC50 of the BTA-EG6 for inhibition of SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection. To do this, CEM-M7 cells were infected with HIV-1ADA and 15 μg/ml SEVI in the presence of BTA-EG6. Ten different BTA-EG6 concentrations were tested, ranging from 0.4 to 50 μg/ml. The data were fit to an exponential decay curve to calculate the IC50, and results are shown in Fig. 2D. The calculated IC50 was 6.6 μg/ml for BTA-EG6 (equivalent to 13 μm). We also wanted to confirm whether the effects of SEVI and BTA-EG6 extended to infection in primary cells. Therefore, we infected PBMCs with HIV-1BAL with 15 μg/ml SEVI in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of BTA-EG6. BTA-EG6 was able to inhibit SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection in PBMCs at similar concentrations to those seen in other cell lines (Fig. 2E). BTA-EG6 had no effect on the infectivity of HIV-1BaL in PBMCs in the absence of SEVI (Fig. 2E). Thus, the effects of BTA-EG6 are neither strain-dependent nor cell type-dependent, and the compound has no effect on HIV-1 infection in the absence of SEVI. For BTA-EG6 to be a viable microbicide candidate, it must be effective not just against the effects of SEVI but should be able to effectively inhibit the infection-enhancing activity of human semen. Therefore, we examined the effect of this compound on semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection. As human semen has been reported to be toxic to cultured cells (12Kiessling A.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 304: 71-86PubMed Google Scholar), we followed the previously described protocol to minimize this toxicity (2Münch J. Rücker E. Ständker L. Adermann K. Goffinet C. Schindler M. Wildum S. Chinnadurai R. Rajan D. Specht A. Giménez-Gallego G. Sánchez P.C. Fowler D.M. Koulov A. Kelly J.W. Mothes W. Grivel J.C. Margolis L. Keppler O.T. Forssmann W.G. Kirchhoff F. Cell. 2007; 131: 1059-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Pooled human semen was added to HIV-1IIIB virus in a 1:1 dilution. After 15 min, this solution was added to cells at a 1:15 dilution for a final concentration of 3.3%. As shown in Fig. 3A, BTA-EG6 efficiently inhibited the semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection at similar concentrations to those active against SEVI alone. Fig. 3B shows that this effect extended to infection with an R5 virus, HIVADA as well. We performed a follow-up experiment to test whether the effects of BTA-EG6 on semen were specific to the infection-enhancing components in semen (i.e. SEVI) or due to a more general inhibitory effect against semen. To do this, we examined whether BTA-EG6 inhibited semen-mediated chemokine release. Human semen has been shown to be pro-inflammatory, mediating the release of IL-8 and MIP-3α from cervical endothelial cells (13Sharkey D.J. Macpherson A.M. Tremellen K.P. Robertson S.A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2007; 13: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This property is thought to be due to the presence of several pro-inflammatory mediators but is not due to the presence of SEVI as we have found that SEVI does not stimulate the release of IL-8 or MIP-3α (data not shown). We treated SiHa cells, a cervical endothelial cell line, with pooled human semen with or without 33 μg/ml BTA-EG6, a dose five times higher than the IC50. After 6 h, supernatants were collected and analyzed for production of IL-8 or MIP-3α. Pooled human semen effectively elicited the production of these chemokines from SiHa cells as expected, whereas BTA-EG6 had no inhibitory effect on semen-stimulated chemokine production (Fig. 3, C and D). To more closely examine how BTA-EG6 mediates its inhibitory effects on SEVI-mediated HIV-1 infection enhancement, we examined the ability of this compound to interfere with SEVI-enhanced binding of HIV-1 virions to the cell surface. The cationic nature of SEVI has been shown to enhance the binding of virions to the cell surface, which allows it to neutralize the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged HIV-1 virion and target cell surface (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J. Kobayashi A. Smith-McCune K. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells were incubated with HIV-1IIIB virions and 15 μg/ml SEVI in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of BTA-EG6. Surface-bound virions were then measured by p24 ELISA after washing off unbound virus. SEVI was able to strongly enhance the binding of virions to the cell surface, and this effect was efficiently abrogated by BTA-EG6 (Fig. 4A). BTA-EG6 had no effect on the binding of HIV virions to the cell surface in the absence of SEVI (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained with an R5 virus, HIV-1ADA (Fig. 4B). Additionally, we performed this experiment using A2En cells, a primary cell-derived endocervical cell line. We found that SEVI also enhanced binding of virions to the surface of these cervical epithelial cells and that this effect was inhibited by BTA-EG6 (Fig. 4C). We also tested whether SEVI would increase HIV-1-mediated chemokine production and whether BTA-EG6 could inhibit this effect. HIV has previously been shown to stimulate the release of MIP-3α and IL-8 from vaginal and cervical epithelial cells (14Li Q. Estes J.D. Schlievert P.M. Duan L. Brosnahan A.J. Southern P.J. Reilly C.S. Peterson M.L. Schultz-Darken N. Brunner K.G. Nephew K.R. Pambuccian S. Lifson J.D. Carlis J.V. Haase A.T. Nature. 2009; 458: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Because SEVI increases the interactions between virions and epithelial cells, we hypothesized that it would likely increase HIV-mediated chemokine release as well. Therefore, we exposed A2En cells to HIV-1BAL virions with and without SEVI, in the presence or absence of BTA-EG6. As seen in Fig. 4D, SEVI modestly increased the release of IL-8 from cells treated with virus, and BTA-EG6 was able to inhibit this release. Similar results were also obtained for MIP-3α (data not shown). For a compound to be a legitimate HIV-1 microbicide candidate, it must not have toxic or inflammatory effects on the cervical endothelium. Loss of this protective layer leads to an increased ability for HIV-1 to cross the mucosal barrier, and inflammatory effects drive recruitment of HIV-1 target cells, further decreasing the natural barriers against successful transmission of HIV. Therefore, we examined the effects of BTA-EG6 on cervical endothelial cells. To do this, we used: 1) SiHa cells, a cervical carcinoma cell line; 2) A2En cells, a primary cell-derived line from the endocervical endothelium; and 3) 3EC1 cells, a primary cell-derived line from the ectocervical endothelium. To evaluate the effects of BTA-EG6 on cell viability, the compound was added to cells at concentrations up to 10× the IC50 for up to 24 h. Viability was assessed at 24 h by using the resazurin cytotoxicity assay. Resazurin cytotoxicity data were confirmed by trypan blue counts of viable cells (data not shown). Fig. 5A shows that BTA-EG6 did not have any effects on cell viability, even at the highest concentrations tested. Nonoxynol-9 (non-9), a spermicide, was used as a positive control as it is known to be toxic to cervical epithelial cells (15Beer B.E. Doncel G.F. Krebs F.C. Shattock R.J. Fletcher P.S. Buckheit Jr., R.W. Watson K. Dezzutti C.S. Cummins J.E. Bromley E. Richardson-Harman N. Pallansch L.A. Lackman-Smith C. Osterling C. Mankowski M. Miller S.R. Catalone B.J. Welsh P.A. Howett M.K. Wigdahl B. Turpin J.A. Reichelderfer P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We also examined whether treatment with BTA-EG6 led to the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from the cervical cell lines. All three cervical cell lines were treated for 6 h with concentrations of BTA-EG6 ranging from 6.6 to 66 μg/ml. Cell culture supernatants were then assessed for the presence of the inflammatory cytokines and chemokines Mip-3α (Fig. 5B), IL-8 (Fig. 5C), IL-1β, and TNF-α (data not shown). These cytokines and chemokines were selected because they have been shown to be up-regulated by other candidate microbicides and because they may play a role in microbicide-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection (16Alt C.

Martin A.P. Hazrati E. Garin A. Guzman E. Wilson S.S. Porter D.D. Lira S.A. Keller M.J. Herold B.C. J. Infect. Dis. 2007; 195: 1332-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Cone R.A. Hoen T. Wong X. Abusuwwa R. Anderson D.J. Moench T.R. BMC Infect Dis. 2006; 6: 90Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). BTA-EG6 did not lead to the release of any of these cytokines or chemokines, even at the highest doses tested. Although more in-depth assessment is obviously necessary, these preliminary results suggest that BTA-EG6 is not toxic to cervical endothelial cells. In this study, we demonstrate that an amyloid-binding small molecule is an efficient inhibitor of SEVI- and semen-mediated enhancement of HIV infectivity. We chose to examine the amyloid-binding small molecule BTA-EG6 based on the hypothesis that it would effectively bind and coat SEVI fibrils as it has been previously shown to do for Aβ (6Inbar P. Li C.Q. Takayama S.A. Bautista M.R. Yang J. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We found that BTA-EG6 bound to the SEVI fibrils and interfered with their ability to enhance HIV infectivity, suggesting that other amyloid-binding small molecules might also prove to be effective microbicide candidates targeting SEVI. Importantly, BTA-EG6 did not have any direct inhibitory effects on the infectivity of HIV-1 alone. BTA-EG6 inhibited SEVI-mediated enhancement of infection by both X4 (HIV-1IIIB) and R5 (HIV-1ADA) strains, in a dose-dependent fashion. In the case of HIV-1ADA, we calculated the IC50 to be 13 μm; this value is 100-fold higher than the measured Kd of BTA-EG6 for binding to aggregated SEVI peptides (127 nm). One explanation for this difference is that the ability of BTA-EG6 to compete with virion/fibril or virion/cell interactions requires a greater number of BTA-EG6 molecules than the noncompetitive binding of BTA-EG6 to SEVI alone. BTA-EG6 also inhibited SEVI-enhanced infection of primary cells (human peripheral blood mononuclear cells) in a dose-dependent fashion, and it blocked SEVI-enhanced binding of X4 (HIV-1IIIB) and R5 (HIV-1ADA) strains to target cells (including both Jurkat T cells and A2En endocervical cells). The ability of SEVI to enhance virus binding to endocervical cells suggests an additional mechanism by which these fibrils might enhance HIV-1 transmission in vivo. The fibrils may enhance the attachment of virus to cells at the cervicovaginal barrier, thereby increasing the likelihood of productive infection of viral target cells in the cervicovaginal mucosa and also eliciting increased production of pro-inflammatory chemokines from cervicovaginal epithelial cells (14Li Q. Estes J.D. Schlievert P.M. Duan L. Brosnahan A.J. Southern P.J. Reilly C.S. Peterson M.L. Schultz-Darken N. Brunner K.G. Nephew K.R. Pambuccian S. Lifson J.D. Carlis J.V. Haase A.T. Nature. 2009; 458: 1034-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar, 19McGowin C.L. Ma L. Martin D.H. Pyles R.B. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our data are consistent with this prediction and show that (i) SEVI enhances the ability of HIV-1 virions to elicit IL-8 and MIP-3α from A2En endocervical cells and (ii) this can be inhibited by BTA-EG6. This is important because it suggests that BTA-EG6 and related compounds may have the potential not only to reduce the efficiency of HIV-1 infection of target cells but also to reduce the level of target cell recruitment to virus-exposed genital mucosal tissue. Our results show that BTA-EG6 effectively prevents semen-mediated enhancement of HIV infectivity, suggesting that this activity of semen can be targeted by specifically inhibiting the SEVI fibrils. BTA-EG6 did not inhibit other properties of semen, such as the ability to elicit pro-inflammatory chemokines (13Sharkey D.J. Macpherson A.M. Tremellen K.P. Robertson S.A. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2007; 13: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), further reinforcing the idea that this small molecule specifically targets the fibrils present in semen. These data not only suggest that BTA-EG6 may be an effective microbicide target but also offer proof of principle support for the concept that screening amyloid- or SEVI-binding molecules may allow identification of additional anti-SEVI microbicide candidates. In the case of BTA-EG6, it is likely that the thioflavin-T analog allows it to intercalate into the SEVI fibrils, whereas the hexa(ethylene glycol) moiety extends and inhibits the interactions of SEVI with cells and virions (6Inbar P. Li C.Q. Takayama S.A. Bautista M.R. Yang J. Chembiochem. 2006; 7: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Oligomeric derivatives of BTA-EG6 and related compounds may prove even more effective due to increased avidity and affinity, as may amyloid binders with modified functional groups. Studies to address these hypotheses are presently underway. Some previous microbicide candidates have not fared well in clinical trials, frequently due to pro-inflammatory properties that damage the cervical mucosa and drive the recruitment of HIV target cells. An instructive example is the nonionic surfactant, nonoxynol-9. Nonoxynol-9 showed strong antiviral activity in preclinical trials but failed to protect against virus transmission in human clinical trials, and in fact, increased the risk of HIV-1 infection by almost 2-fold in women who used the agent several times a day (20Van Damme L. Ramjee G. Alary M. Vuylsteke B. Chandeying V. Rees H. Sirivongrangson P. Mukenge-Tshibaka L. Ettiègne-Traoré V. Uaheowitchai C. Karim S.S. Mâsse B. Perriëns J. Laga M.

Dis. 2002; 2: 613-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This infection-enhancing activity has been attributed to toxic and pro-inflammatory effects on female reproductive tissue, which increase susceptibility to virus transmission (22Fichorova R.N. Tucker L.D. Anderson D.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2001; 184: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to consider toxicity when evaluating candidate microbicides. We have found that BTA-EG6 is not toxic to a variety of cervical cells and that it does not drive the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that have been shown to be important in recruiting HIV target cells. An additional consideration for many candidate microbicides is that their properties can, in some cases, be negatively impacted by the presence of semen. The anionic polymer PRO-2000 also showed robust activity in in vitro studies and preclinical models (23Dezzutti C.S. James V.N. Ramos A. Sullivan S.T. Siddig A. Bush T.J. Grohskopf L.A. Paxton L.

C. Reasons for the futility of PRO-2000 remain unclear but may include inhibition of its antiviral activity by seminal plasma (27Patel S. Hazrati E. Cheshenko N. Galen B. Yang H. Guzman E. Wang R. Herold B.C. Keller M.J. J. Infect. Dis. 2007; 196: 1394-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); this may contribute to its decreased effectiveness in postcoital cervicovaginal fluid (28Keller M.J. Mesquita P.M. Torres N.M.

In our experiments, the presence of semen had no effect on the microbicidal activity of BTA-EG6. It is important to compare the properties of the anti-SEVI small molecules described here with those of previously identified inhibitors of SEVI-enhanced HIV infection activity. Other previously described SEVI inhibitors, such as polyanionic compounds (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J. Kobayashi A. Smith-McCune K. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and the heparin antagonist surfen (29Roan N.R. Sowinski S. Münch J. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 1861-1869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), block the actions of SEVI at least in part due to simple electrostatic interactions with the cationic fibrils. Given recent experience with the polyanionic agent PRO-20003 and the presence of small cationic peptides in both semen and cervicovaginal fluid (30Lai S.K. Hida K. Shukair S. Wang Y.Y. Figueiredo A.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 7560-7567Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), this raises concerns. In contrast, amyloid-binding small molecules, such as BTA-EG6, do not rely on electrostatic properties to bind to SEVI and are therefore expected to offer a new class of SEVI inhibitors whose effects are more specifically targeted at the fibrils themselves. This is expected to reduce potential for off-target effects and increase potential for effectiveness in an in vivo setting. Finally, current microbicide candidates target the HIV virus itself (32Cutler B. Justman J. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2008; 8: 685-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), whereas the inhibitor described here does not. We propose that because semen is the vector in the vast majority of transmitted HIV-1 infections, it is reasonable to consider that the addition of a SEVI inhibitor to microbicide formulations might improve the efficacy of antiviral microbicides.

Warren of the National Institutes of Health for support and encouragement, and Dr. Jim Turpin of the National Institutes of Health for advice and discussions."

The expression of Gb3 also affects several diseases, including cancer metastasis and Fabry disease, which prompted us to look for factors involved in its metabolism. In the present study, we isolated two cDNAs that conferred resistance to Stx-induced cell death in HeLa cells by expression cloning: ganglioside GM3 synthase and the COOH terminus region of glutamate receptor, ionotropic, N-methyl-D-asparate-associated protein 1 (GRINA), a member of the transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif containing (TMBIM) family. Overexpression of the truncated form, named GRINA-C, and some members of the full-length TMBIM family, including FAS inhibitory molecule 2 (FAIM2), reduced Gb3, and lactosylceramide was accumulated instead. The change of glycolipid composition was restored by overexpression of Gb3 synthase, suggesting that the synthase is affected by GRINA-C and FAIM2. Interestingly, the mRNA level of Gb3 synthase was unchanged. Rather, localization of the synthase as well as TGN46, a trans-Golgi network marker, was perturbed to form punctate structures, and degradation of the synthase in lysosomes was enhanced. Furthermore, GRINA-C was associated with Gb3 synthase. These observations may demonstrate a new type of posttranscriptional regulation of glycosyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W2138387509,"Background Mater and Padi6 are maternal effect genes that are first expressed during oocyte growth and are required for embryonic development beyond the two-cell stage in the mouse. We have recently found that PADI6 localizes to, and is required for the formation of, abundant fibrillar Triton X-100 (Triton) insoluble structures termed the oocyte cytoplasmic lattices (CPLs). Given their similar expression profiles and mutant mouse phenotypes, we have been testing the hypothesis that MATER also plays a role in CPL formation and/or function. Methodology/Findings Herein, we show that PADI6 and MATER co-localize throughout the oocyte cytoplasm following Triton extraction, suggesting that MATER co-localizes with PADI6 at the CPLs. Additionally, the solubility of PADI6 was dramatically increased in Matertm/tm oocytes following Triton extraction, suggesting that MATER is involved in CPL nucleation. This prediction is supported by transmission electron microscopic analysis of Mater+/+ and Matertm/tm germinal vesicle stage oocytes which illustrated that volume fraction of CPLs was reduced by 90% in Matertm/tm oocytes compared to Mater+/+ oocytes. Conclusions Taken together, these results suggest that, similar to PADI6, MATER is also required for CPL formation. Given that PADI6 and MATER are essential for female fertility, these results not only strengthen the hypothesis that the lattices play a critical role in mediating events during the oocyte-to-embryo transition but also increase our understanding of the molecular nature of the CPLs."

https://openalex.org/W1982106400,"Antiretroviral cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G, which is abundantly expressed in peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages, strongly protects these cells against HIV-1 infection. The HIV-1 Vif protein overcomes this antiviral effect by enhancing proteasome-mediated APOBEC3G degradation and is key for maintaining viral infectivity. The 579-bp-long vif gene displays high genetic diversity among HIV-1 subtypes. Therefore, it is intriguing to address whether Vif proteins derived from different subtypes differ in their viral defense activity against APOBEC3G. Expression plasmids encoding Vif proteins derived from subtypes A, B, C, CRF01_AE, and CRF02_AG isolates were created, and their anti-APOBEC3G activities were compared. Viruses produced from cells expressing APOBEC3G and Vif proteins from different subtypes showed relatively different viral infectivities. Notably, subtype C-derived Vif proteins tested had the highest activity against APOBEC3G that was ascribed to its increased binding activity, for which the N-terminal domain of the Vif protein sequences was responsible. These results suggest that the biological differences of Vif proteins belonging to different subtypes might affect viral fitness and quasispecies in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2099102877,"Neuropeptides are critical integrative elements within the central circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), where they mediate both cell-to-cell synchronization and phase adjustments that cause light entrainment. Forward peptidomics identified little SAAS, derived from the proSAAS prohormone, among novel SCN peptides, but its role in the SCN is poorly understood.Little SAAS localization and co-expression with established SCN neuropeptides were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using highly specific antisera and stereological analysis. Functional context was assessed relative to c-FOS induction in light-stimulated animals and on neuronal circadian rhythms in glutamate-stimulated brain slices. We found that little SAAS-expressing neurons comprise the third most abundant neuropeptidergic class (16.4%) with unusual functional circuit contexts. Little SAAS is localized within the densely retinorecipient central SCN of both rat and mouse, but not the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). Some little SAAS colocalizes with vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) or gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), known mediators of light signals, but not arginine vasopressin (AVP). Nearly 50% of little SAAS neurons express c-FOS in response to light exposure in early night. Blockade of signals that relay light information, via NMDA receptors or VIP- and GRP-cognate receptors, has no effect on phase delays of circadian rhythms induced by little SAAS.Little SAAS relays signals downstream of light/glutamatergic signaling from eye to SCN, and independent of VIP and GRP action. These findings suggest that little SAAS forms a third SCN neuropeptidergic system, processing light information and activating phase-shifts within novel circuits of the central circadian clock."

Here we investigate stereopsis in the neurological patient D.F., whose ventral stream, specifically lateral occipital cortex, has been damaged bilaterally, causing profound visual form agnosia. Despite her severe damage to cortical visual areas, we report that DF's stereo vision is strikingly unimpaired. She is better than many control observers at using binocular disparity to judge whether an isolated object appears near or far, and to resolve ambiguous structure-from-motion. DF is, however, poor at using relative disparity between features at different locations across the visual field. This may stem from a difficulty in identifying the surface boundaries where relative disparity is available. We suggest that the ventral processing stream may play a critical role in enabling healthy observers to extract fine depth information from relative disparities within one surface or between surfaces located in different parts of the visual field."

Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) activate GTPases by catalyzing the exchange of their GDP for GTP. Here we present crystallographic and biochemical studies of a GEF reaction with four crystal structures of Arabidopsis thaliana ARA7, a plant homolog of Rab5 GTPase, in complex with its GEF, VPS9a, in the nucleotide-free and GDP-bound forms, as well as a complex with aminophosphonic acid-guanylate ester and ARA7·VPS9a(D185N) with GDP. Upon complex formation with ARA7, VPS9 wedges into the interswitch region of ARA7, inhibiting the coordination of Mg2+ and decreasing the stability of GDP binding. The aspartate finger of VPS9a recognizes GDP β-phosphate directly and pulls the P-loop lysine of ARA7 away from GDP β-phosphate toward switch II to further destabilize GDP for its release during the transition from the GDP-bound to nucleotide-free intermediates in the nucleotide exchange reaction.

https://openalex.org/W2044089069,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most frequent monogenic cause of kidney failure, characterized by the development of renal cysts. ADPKD is caused by mutations of the polycystin-1 (PC1) or polycystin-2 (PC2) genes. PC2 encodes a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel, and its dysfunction has been implicated in cyst development. The transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ) is required for the integrity of renal cilia. Its absence results in the development of renal cysts in a knock-out mouse model. TAZ directly interacts with PC2, and it has been suggested that another yet unidentified PDZ domain protein may be involved in the TAZ/PC2 interaction. Here we describe a novel interaction of TAZ with the multi-PDZ-containing PALS1-associated tight junction protein (PATJ). TAZ interacts with both the N-terminal PDZ domains 1-3 and the C-terminal PDZ domains 8-10 of PATJ, suggesting two distinct TAZ binding domains. We also show that the C terminus of PC2 strongly interacts with PDZ domains 8-10 and to a weaker extent with PDZ domains 1-3 of PATJ. Finally, we demonstrate that both TAZ and PATJ impair PC2 channel activity when co-expressed with PC2 in oocytes of Xenopus laevis. These results implicate TAZ and PATJ as novel regulatory elements of the PC2 channel and might thus be involved in ADPKD pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2085693741,"The ERK5 cascade is a MAPK pathway that transmits both mitogenic and stress signals, yet its mechanism of activation is not fully understood. Using intracellular calcium modifiers, we found that ERK5 activation by EGF is inhibited both by the depletion and elevation of intracellular calcium levels. This calcium effect was found to occur upstream of MEKK2, which is the MAP3K of the ERK5 cascade. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that EGF increases MEKK2 binding to the adaptor protein Lad1, and this interaction was reduced by the intracellular calcium modifiers, indicating that a proper calcium concentration is required for the interactions and transmission of EGF signals to ERK5. In vitro binding assays revealed that the proper calcium concentration is required for a direct binding of MEKK2 to Lad1. The binding of these proteins is not affected by c-Src-mediated phosphorylation on Lad1, but slightly affects the Tyr phosphorylation of MEKK2, suggesting that the interaction with Lad1 is necessary for full Tyr phosphorylation of MEKK2. In addition, we found that changes in calcium levels affect the EGF-induced nuclear translocation of MEKK2 and thereby its effect on the nuclear ERK5 activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that calcium is required for EGF-induced ERK5 activation, and this effect is probably mediated by securing proper interaction of MEKK2 with the upstream adaptor protein Lad1."

Pichia pastoris Pfk (PpPfk) is, with ~1 MDa, the most complex and probably largest eukaryotic Pfk. We have determined the crystal structure of full-length PpPfk to 3.05 Å resolution in the T state. PpPfk forms a (αβγ)4 dodec-amer of D2 symmetry with dimensions of 161 × 157 × 233 Å mainly via interactions of the α chains. The N-terminal domains of the a and β chains have folds that are distantly related to glyoxalase I, but the active sites are no longer functional. Interestingly, these domains located at the 2 distal ends of this protein along the long 2-fold axis form a (aβ)2 dimer as does the core Pfk domains;however, the domains are swapped across the tetramerization interface. In PpPfk, the unique γ subunit participates in oligomerization of the αβ chains. This modulator protein was acquired from an ancient S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyl-transferase. The identification of novel ATP binding sites, which do not correspond to the bacterial catalytic or effector binding sites, point to marked structural and functional differences between bacterial and eukaryotic Pfks.—Strater, N., Marek, S., Kuettner, E.

Like all other herpesviruses, HHV-6 and -7 remain latent or establish persistent infections. To do so, they must avoid detection and elimination by the immune system.

Judging from the number and molecular diversity of these strategies, the removal of class I MHC-peptide complexes from the cell surface must be evolutionarily advantageous to these viruses as a means of escaping immune detection and thriving in a host. Because so many of the viral immunoevasins affect trafficking or stability of class I MHC molecules, in previous work, we took a biochemical approach to examine the maturation and stability of class I molecules in HHV-7-infected T cells (11Hudson A.W. Howley P.M. Ploegh H.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12347-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We found that class I MHC stability was indeed decreased in HHV-7-infected T cells and that a 55-kDa viral glycoprotein coimmunoprecipitated with class I MHC molecules. We identified this associated protein as the product of the HHV-7 U21 open reading frame. HHV-7 U21 lacks homology to any other gene product or domain, with the exception of the U21 encoded by HHV-6. U21 is a type I membrane protein that binds to newly synthesized, properly folded MHC class I molecules in the ER, shortly after their synthesis. In previous studies, we expressed the U21 open reading frame in U373 astrocytoma cells, in the absence of viral context. Expression of U21 in U373 cells resulted in a dramatic redistribution of class I molecules to lysosomes and a commensurate reduction of class I molecules on the plasma membrane (see Fig. 2) (10Glosson N.L. Hudson A.W. Virology. 2007; 365: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Hudson A.W. Howley P.M. Ploegh H.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12347-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We first hypothesized that the lumenal domain of U21 bound to class I MHC molecules, and the cytoplasmic tail of U21 contained the lysosomal targeting information necessary to reroute the two molecules to the lysosomal compartment. We tested this hypothesis by expressing a U21 molecule lacking its cytoplasmic tail in U373 cells. We found, to our surprise, that the cytoplasmic tail of U21 was not necessary for the ability of U21 to divert class I molecules to lysosomes (18Hudson A.W. Blom D. Howley P.M. Ploegh H.L. Traffic. 2003; 4: 824-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The tailless U21 molecule could divert class I MHC molecules to lysosomes, as could the lumenal domain of U21 fused to the transmembrane and the cytoplasmic tail of a heterologous type I membrane protein, CD4 (18Hudson A.W. Blom D. Howley P.M. Ploegh H.L. Traffic. 2003; 4: 824-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the lumenal domain of U21 is not only responsible for associating with class I molecules, but it also contains the information necessary to induce rerouting of class I MHC molecules to the lysosomal compartment. In the current study, we examine some of the molecular properties that govern U21-mediated diversion of class I MHC molecules to the lysosomal compartment. For the generation of β2-microglobulin (β2m) shRNA in human U373-MG cells, a 19-nucleotide region of the human β2m cDNA was cloned into pRETRO (19Mostoslavsky G. Fabian A.J. Rooney S. Alt F.W. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16406-16411Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The selected 19-nucleotide sequence is as follows (the numbers in parentheses indicate human β2m nucleotide coordinates, where 1 represents the adenosine of the start codon): TTGTGGAGCTTGTTGAATT (286–304). All cDNAs of U21 were cloned into the retroviral vectors pLNCX (Clontech), pHAGE-MCS (for K562 cells), or pHAGEpuroMCS (PPM). The lentiviral vector pHAGE was generously provided by Drs. Gustavo Mostoslavsky and Richard Mulligan (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) (19Mostoslavsky G. Fabian A.J. Rooney S. Alt F.W. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16406-16411Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The U21NSBPHA tandem tag construct consists of amino acids 1–358 of U21 followed by a streptavidin-binding protein tag and an HA epitope tag, separated by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site (SBPHA) (20Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The U21NSBPHA KDEL construct contains an additional aaggatgaactgtga (KDEL) sequence following the HA portion of the tag. The HLA-A2-HA construct contains amino acids 1–336 of HLA-A2, followed by an HA tag and a stop codon. The murine H-2Kb chimera was constructed by fusing the cytoplasmic tail of HLA-A2 to the transmembrane region of H-2Kb. The amino acid sequence at the junction of the two molecules is as follows: VAVLVVLGAAIVTGAVVAFVRRRSSDRRGGSYSQAASSDSAQGSDVSLTACRV*, where the underline indicates the transmembrane sequence of H-2Kb, the plain type indicates the cytoplasmic tail of the HLA-A2 molecule, the bold type indicates the three lysines in the cytoplasmic tail of HLA-A2 that were mutated to arginines. The asterisk represents the stop codon. U373 astrocytoma cells were cultured in DMEM including 5% fetal bovine serum and 5% newborn calf serum in the presence or absence of puromycin (375 ng/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or geneticin (500 μg/ml) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Expression of the viral protein U21 and its variants in U373, HeLa, or K562 cells was carried out via retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. U373 astrocytoma cells were infected with retroviruses encoding HHV7-U21, a small hairpin RNA directed against β2m (shβ2m), U21NSBPHAKDEL, HHV-6A U21SBPHA, HHV-6B U21SBPHA, HHV-7 U21SBPHA, U21NSBPHA, HHV-6A U21HA, and the U21 glycosylation mutants. In most cases, the neomycin-resistant clones exhibited some heterogeneity of expression level, so clonal cell lines were analyzed, rather than pooled neomycin-resistant clones, so that cell populations appeared fairly uniform and are representative of >80% of the cells examined. The cell lines expressing HHV-7, -6A, and -6B U21SBPHA are described in Ref. 10Glosson N.L. Hudson A.W. Virology. 2007; 365: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar. Cell lines expressing shβ2m were characterized and described in detail in Ref. 21Blom D. Hirsch C. Stern P. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar. The myeloid K562 cells were spinoculated twice with a lentivirus encoding HHV7-U21. W6/32 is a mAb that recognizes assembled, β2m-associated HLA-A, -B, or -C molecules. Anti-Giantin was purchased from Covance (San Diego, CA). Immunofluorescence studies were performed either with a polyclonal antibody (HA.11) directed against the HA epitope tag (Affiinity BioReagents, Golden, CO) or the anti-HA mAb 12CA5. Anti-HA immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with the 12CA5 mAb. Alexa Fluor 488- and 594-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). In some instances, Alexa 594-conjugated Fab fragments (Zenon; Invitrogen) were used to label lamp2 mAbs. Anti-lamp2 mAb was the generous gift of Dr. T. August (Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore, MD). A phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-HLA-A,B,C mAb (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ) was used in flow cytometry experiments. Polyclonal anti-protein-disulfide isomerase antiserum was generously supplied by Dr. H. Ploegh (Whitehead Institute, MIT, Boston, MA). The polyclonal antibody MCW50 is a rabbit polyclonal antibody that was raised against native GST fused in frame to the cytoplasmic tail of U21. The mAb Y3, directed against H-2Kb, was generously supplied by Dr. P. Cresswell (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). The rabbit polyclonal antibody GM130 was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. The cells were detached with trypsin and incubated with methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were labeled with 350 μCi/ml of [35S]-Express label (1175Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Waltham, MA) at 37 °C for the indicated times and chased with complete DMEM supplemented with nonradiolabeled methionine and cysteine to a final concentration of 1 mm at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl). The lysates were centrifuged for 5–10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C in an Eppendorf centrifuge to pellet nuclei and debris, followed by immunoprecipitation with specific antiserum and protein A-agarose (RepliGen Corporation, Waltham, MA). Immunoprecipitates were normalized to equal trichloroacetic acid-precipitable 35S-labeled protein. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with Nonidet P-40 wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Leupeptin (200 μm) (EMD Biosciences, Inc., Gibbstown, NJ) and folimycin (20 nm) (concanamycin A) (EMD Biosciences, Inc.) were added to the cells 45 min prior to the pulse and were also included in the pulse and chase medium at the same concentrations. In some experiments, tunicamycin (Sigma) was added to the starvation medium at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml for 45 min and to the pulse and chase medium at the same final concentration. Peptide:N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) or and endoglycosidase Hf (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) were added to the immunoprecipitates according to the vendor's instructions. The cells were washed and lysed as described above. The cell lysates were assayed for protein concentration in triplicate using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo-Fisher, Rockford, IL). For immunoblotting of cell lysates, equal concentrations of protein from each sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to BA-85 nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ). Equal loading was further confirmed using Ponceau S staining of the nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was simultaneously probed with HC10 (anti-class I MHC) and HA.11, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The bands were visualized using the Pierce SuperSignal chemiluminescence reagents (Thermo-Fisher). Immunofluorescence was performed as described (18Hudson A.W. Blom D. Howley P.M. Ploegh H.L. Traffic. 2003; 4: 824-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and followed by Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibodies. Tunicamycin (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was added to the cells at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml 10 h prior to fixation. Flow cytometry was performed as described (18Hudson A.W. Blom D. Howley P.M. Ploegh H.L. Traffic. 2003; 4: 824-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), using phycoerythrin anti-human class I MHC (anti-HLA-A,B,C). To extend our knowledge of the ability of U21 to reroute class I MHC molecules to lysosomes, we next asked whether a soluble, secreted form of U21 could also divert class I molecules to lysosomes. To address this question, we generated a soluble form of U21 lacking a transmembrane domain (U21N), fused to a tandem affinity tag (SBPHA), comprised of a 46-amino acid streptavidin-binding protein domain and an HA epitope tag separated by a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site (20Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The entire tag, including spacer amino acids, is 78 amino acids long (Fig. 1a). To determine whether the soluble U21NSBPHA molecule could associate with class I MHC molecules, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments from cells expressing U21NSBPHA. We recovered class I MHC molecules from U373 control cells, U21 cells, and U21NSBPHA cells with W6/32, an antibody directed against properly folded class I MHC molecules. In U21NSBPHA cells, a diffuse polypeptide of ∼65–75 kDa was recovered with class I molecules that is absent in immunoprecipitations from U373 control cells or U21-expressing cells (Fig. 1b, compare lane 3 with lanes 1 and 2). Immunoblotting confirmed the identity of this polypeptide as U21NSBPHA (data not shown). As would be predicted of a soluble U21NSBPHA molecule, it is secreted into the medium (data not shown), which, together with its ability to bind to class I MHC molecules, suggests that the soluble U21NSBPHA molecule is folded properly. In addition, soluble U21NSBPHA migrates diffusely in this SDS gel. We believe this diffuse migration to be due to complex-type oligosaccharide modifications that occur as the secreted U21NSBPHA molecule makes its way through the secretory pathway. The 78-amino acid SBPHA tag increases the size of the U21 molecule by only 8 amino acids, because the chimera lacks its cytoplasmic tail (50 amino acids) and transmembrane domain (20 amino acids). Thus, U21NSBPHA should closely comigrate with U21. However, soluble U21NSBPHA exhibits aberrantly slow mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1b, lane 3). To determine whether the soluble U21NSBPHA could divert class I MHC molecules to the lysosomal compartment, we examined the localization of class I MHC molecules in cells expressing soluble U21NSBPHA (Fig. 2). For comparison, we show class I MHC localization on the cell surface in control U373 cells (Fig. 2a) and localization of class I MHC molecules in the lysosomal compartment in U21 cells (Fig. 2b). In cells expressing soluble U21NSBPHA, we observe a combination of these two phenotypes; there are intense perinuclear puncta that are never evident in control U373 cells (Fig. 2, c versus a), yet there is slightly more class I MHC labeling of the cell surface in U21NSBPHA cells when compared with U21 cells (Fig. 2, c versus b). We attribute greater surface expression of class I molecules in U21NSBPHA cells to the freedom of soluble U21 from membrane constraint: U21NSBPHA may exist in the ER lumen at lower effective concentration near the membrane, in the vicinity of class I MHC molecules. To confirm that the puncta we observe in U21NSBPHA cells are indicative of lysosomal localization, we performed colocalization experiments with the lysosomal marker lamp2 and found that the puncta colocalize (Fig. 2, compare c and e). Thus, in addition to associating with class I MHC molecules, soluble U21NSBPHA can also divert class I molecules to a lysosomal compartment, albeit less efficiently than membrane-constrained U21. We also examined the steady state localization of the U21NSBPHA molecules themselves, using an antibody directed against the HA epitope within the SBPHA tag. As with most secreted proteins, at steady state, soluble U21NSBPHA is localized in the secretory pathway, primarily in the ER (Fig. 2d). Strangely, despite its ability to bind to and reroute class I MHC molecules to the lysosomal compartment, soluble U21N molecules localize to a different intracellular compartment than the class I MHC molecules they reroute. Initially when we expressed full-length U21, we found that class I MHC molecules were redistributed to the lysosomal compartment (Fig. 2) (11Hudson A.W. Howley P.M. Ploegh H.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 12347-12358Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We first hypothesized that U21 escorted class I MHC molecules to a lysosomal compartment, and we fully expected U21 to colocalize with class I molecules in lysosomes. Without an antibody directed against U21, we resorted to tagging U21 at its C terminus with an HA tag (U21HA). Expression of U21HA also resulted in the rerouting of class I MHC molecules to the lysosomal compartment. Interestingly, however, when we examined the localization of the HA-tagged U21 molecules themselves, we found U21HA localized in the ER and secretory pathway (data not shown). Because the U21HA molecule was tagged, we were unable to rule out the possibility that the epitope tag impaired its normal trafficking and localization. To better ascertain the steady state localization of U21, we have now raised a polyclonal antibody to the cytoplasmic tail of U21. To examine the localization of U21, we expressed nontagged full-length U21 in U373 or HeLa cells using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer and examined U21 and class I MHC localization using immunofluorescence microscopy. We performed double-label immunolocalization experiments with anti-U21 and W6/32. Like the HA-tagged U21, nontagged U21 was localized to the biosynthetic compartments of ER and Golgi (Fig. 3, b and e), whereas class I MHC molecules were located in lysosomes (Fig. 3, a and d). Interestingly, a few of the cells labeled with U21 also exhibited faint puncta that colocalize with class I MHC molecules, in addition to the overwhelming ER and Golgi pattern (Fig. 3, b and e, white arrows coincident with pink arrows in a and d). Although visible colocalization of U21 and class I molecules is infrequent and difficult to see, we hypothesize that the steady state abundance of U21 in the biosynthetic pathway “outshines” the U21 that ultimately travels to the lysosomal compartment. One possible explanation for the relative difference in colocalization between U21 and class I molecules is that U21 may be more exquisitely sensitive to lysosomal proteases than class I molecules; thus, U21 may be less visible in the lysosomes at steady state. If this were the case, we would expect that incubation of the cells in lysosomal protease inhibitors might stabilize U21 and class I molecules in lysosomes, and this is indeed the case (10Glosson N.L. Hudson A.W. Virology. 2007; 365: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To better illustrate the localization of U21 in the Golgi, we performed a double labeling experiment with GM130, a Golgi marker, and HA-tagged U21 (Fig. 3, g–i). U21 in the perinuclear region colocalizes with GM130. ER (and nuclear envelope) localization is also visible (Fig. 3h, arrowheads). The steady state distribution of U21 is puzzling: how can U21 be located primarily in the ER, whereas the class I molecules with which it associates are concentrated in lysosomes? Can U21 somehow modify class I molecules in the ER, rendering them competent to travel to the lysosome without U21 accompaniment? Is the continued association of U21 with class I molecules necessary for diversion of class I molecules to lysosomes? To determine whether U21 is capable of directing class I molecules to lysosomes while itself remaining in the ER, we placed an ER localization signal on the cytoplasmic tail of U21. There are two types of ER localization signals, both of which signal the retrieval of ER-resident proteins from the cis-Golgi, returning them to the ER (22Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 23Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). A C-terminal cytoplasmic KKXX motif mediates retrieval of transmembrane proteins via cytoplasmic recognition of the ER retrieval signal, and a C-terminal KDEL sequence, found on soluble proteins, is the signal for retrieval of soluble proteins from the cis-Golgi (22Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 24Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 25Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar, 26Nilsson T. Jackson M. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We first engineered a C-terminal KKXX (KKMP) sequence on the cytoplasmic tail of U21. However, the KKMP sequence resulted in the accumulation of U21 at ER exit sites (data not shown). We therefore placed a KDEL ER retrieval signal on the C terminus of the soluble U21NSBPHA. As shown in Fig. 2, soluble U21NSBPHA also diverts class I MHC molecules to the lysosomal compartment, albeit less efficiently than U21 containing an integral membrane domain. To determine whether our soluble U21NSBPHA-KDEL molecules were successfully localized in the ER at steady state, we performed pulse-chase experiments with U21NSBPHA-KDEL cells. At each chase point, we recovered class I molecules with W6/32 and digested half of the immunoprecipitates with endoglycosidase H (EndoH), which cleaves N-linked glycans, but only if they have not progressed beyond the early Golgi. When a glycoprotein travels beyond the medial Golgi, it becomes resistant to EndoH digestion. Thus, assessment of EndoH sensitivity is a way to monitor the progress of a glycoprotein as it traverses the secretory pathway. Immunoprecipitation of class I molecules with W6/32 recovers U21NSBPHA-KDEL molecules (Fig. 4a, compare lanes 4–6 with lanes 1–3), demonstrating that the truncated KDEL-fused U21NSBPHA molecules associate with class I MHC molecules. In U21NSBPHA-KDEL cells, approximately half of the class I molecules remain EndoH-sensitive at 30 min (compare acquisition of EndoH resistance; Fig. 4a, lanes 10–12 versus lanes 7–9). If U21NSBPHA-KDEL were expressed in every cell at levels comparable with the expression levels of class I MHC molecules, we would expect all of the class I MHC molecules to remain EndoH-sensitive. The U21NSBPHA-KDEL cells, however, are pooled neomycin-resistant cells expressing heterogeneous levels of U21NSBPHA-KDEL molecules. The EndoH-resistant class I molecules present in lanes 11 and 12 likely represent class I molecules from cells with low levels of U21NSBPHA-KDEL expression. All of the ER-tethered U21NSBPHA-KDEL molecules that coprecipitate with the anti-class I MHC antibody are EndoH-sensitive (Fig. 4a, compare lanes 10–12 with lanes 4–6). Likewise, all of the class I molecules associated with the KDEL-retained version of U21NSBPHA are EndoH-sensitive (Fig. 4b, compare class I heavy chain molecules in lanes 7 and 8 with lanes 5 and 6). Thus, the KDEL sequence successfully results in the steady state localization of U21N molecules in the ER; when U21 is localized in the ER, the class I MHC molecules with which it associates are also retained in the ER, suggesting that to divert class I MHC molecules, U21 must accompany them out of the ER and travel with them through the Golgi. To examine the localization of class I molecules in U21NSBPHA-KDEL cells, we performed double-label immunofluorescence localization experiments, using W6/32 to examine the localization of class I MHC molecules and an antibody directed against the ER-resident protein, protein-disulfide isomerase, to mark the ER. Control U373 cells express class I MHC molecules on their cell surface, and protein-disulfide isomerase is distributed in the reticular pattern characteristic of the ER (Fig. 5, a and b). For comparison, in cells expressing U21, class I MHC molecules are localized to lysosomes (Fig. 5c). Class I MHC molecules in cells expressing soluble U21NSBPHA are present in lysosomes and on the cell surface (Fig. 5e). However, when U21NSBPHA molecules are retained in the ER with a KDEL sequence, class I MHC molecules also remain in the ER (Fig. 5, g and h), corroborating the pulse-chase experiments shown in Fig. 4 and suggesting that W6/32-reactive class I molecules are bound by U21 in the ER and that U21 must be able to leave the ER with class I MHC molecules to effect their diversion to lysosomes. The observation that the majority of U21 is present in the ER at steady state (Fig. 3b) prompted us to delve more deeply into the trafficking of U21: is U21 retained in the ER until it binds to a class I MHC molecule, or is it synthesized and immediately routed to lysosomes, regardless of whether it is bound to class I? To address this question, we examined U21 trafficking in the absence of class I molecules. Because most nucleated cells express both alleles of three different class I MHC genes (HLA-A, -B, and -C), rather than knock down all six of the class I heavy chains, we employed retrovirally encoded RNAi to knock down the class I MHC light chain, β2m. In the absence of β2m, class I heavy chain molecules cannot fold properly, and any remaining unfolded class I molecules are unable to bind to U21 (18Hudson A.W. Blom D. Howley P.M. Ploegh H.L. Traffic. 2003; 4: 824-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The resulting reduction in W6/32-reactive class I MHC molecules is illustrated in Fig. 6, where W6/32 labeling of U21-expressing cells (Fig. 6a) is depicted at the same exposure as U21 cells lacking β2m (Fig. 6b). Immunoblots confirmed knockdown of β2m to undetectable levels (21Blom D. Hirsch C. Stern P. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 650-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). If"
https://openalex.org/W2073169638,"Background Automated standoff detection and classification of explosives based on their characteristic vapours would be highly desirable. Biologically derived odorant receptors have potential as the explosive recognition element in novel biosensors. Caenorhabditis elegans' genome contains over 1,000 uncharacterised candidate chemosensory receptors. It was not known whether any of these respond to volatile chemicals derived from or associated with explosives. Methodology/Principal Findings We assayed C. elegans for chemotactic responses to chemical vapours of explosives and compounds associated with explosives. C. elegans failed to respond to many of the explosive materials themselves but showed strong chemotaxis with a number of compounds associated with commercial or homemade explosives. Genetic mutant strains were used to identify the likely neuronal location of a putative receptor responding to cyclohexanone, which is a contaminant of some compounded explosives, and to identify the specific transduction pathway involved. Upper limits on the sensitivity of the nematode were calculated. A sensory adaptation protocol was used to estimate the receptive range of the receptor. Conclusions/Significance: The results suggest that C. elegans may be a convenient source of highly sensitive, narrowly tuned receptors to detect a range of explosive-associated volatiles."
https://openalex.org/W2091358872,"Past studies of bone extracellular matrix phosphoproteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein have yielded important biological information regarding their role in calcification and the regulation of cellular activity. Most of these studies have been limited to proteins extracted from mammalian and avian vertebrates and nonvertebrates. The present work describes the isolation and purification of two major highly glycosylated and phosphorylated extracellular matrix proteins of 70 and 22 kDa from herring fish bones. The 70-kDa phosphoprotein has some characteristics of osteopontin with respect to amino acid composition and susceptibility to thrombin cleavage. Unlike osteopontin, however, it was found to contain high levels of sialic acid similar to bone sialoprotein. The 22-kDa protein has very different properties such as very high content of phosphoserine (∼270 Ser(P) residues/1000 amino acid residues), Ala, and Asx residues. The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of both the 70-kDa (NPIMA(M)ETTS(M)DSKVNPLL) and the 22-kDa (NQDMAMEASSDPEAA) fish phosphoproteins indicate that these unique amino acid sequences are unlike any published in protein databases. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that the 70-kDa phosphoprotein was present principally in bone and in calcified scales, whereas the 22-kDa phosphoprotein was detected only in bone. Immunohistological analysis revealed diffusely positive immunostaining for both the 70- and 22-kDa phosphoproteins throughout the matrix of the bone. Overall, this work adds additional support to the concept that the mechanism of biological calcification has common evolutionary and fundamental bases throughout vertebrate species."
