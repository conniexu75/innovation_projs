https://openalex.org/W1992771067,"A nonhomologous integration vector was used to identify the Toxoplasma gondii hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HXGPRT) gene by insertional mutagenesis. Parasite mutants resistant to 6-thioxanthine arose at a frequency of ∼3 × 10−7. Genomic DNA flanking the insertion sites was retrieved by marker rescue and used to identify molecular clones exhibiting unambiguous homology to H(X)GPRT genes from other species. Sequence analysis of vector/genome junction sites reveals that integration of the linearized vector occurred with minimal rearrangement of either vector or target sequences, although the addition of filler DNA and small duplications or deletions of genomic sequences at the transgene termini was observed. Two differentially spliced classes of cDNA clones were identified, both of which complement hpt and gpt mutations in Escherichia coli. Kinetic analysis of purified recombinant enzyme revealed no significant differences between the two isoforms. Internally deleted clones spanning the genomic locus were used to create “knock-out” parasites, which lack all detectable HXGPRT activity. Complete activity could be restored to these knock-out mutants by transient transformation with either genomic DNA or cDNA-derived minigenes encoding both enzyme isoforms. Stable HXGPRT+ transformants were isolated under selection with mycophenolic acid, demonstrating the feasibility of HXGPRT as both a positive and negative selectable marker for stable transformation of T. gondii.

The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous intracellular pathogen that has recently received considerable attention as a leading opportunistic infection associated with AIDS (Luft and Remington, 30Luft B.J. Remington J.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 211-222Google Scholar). Aside from its clinical significance, T. gondii is also a useful model for the study of intracellular protozoan parasites, due to its genetic accessibility and ease of culture (Pfefferkorn, 44Pfefferkorn E.R.

Molecular genetic tools for analyzing the haploid tachyzoite form of T. gondii parasites include transient and stable transformation vectors (Donald and Roos, 9Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl.

Insertional mutagenesis in Toxoplasma is based on the parasite's dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase (DHFR-TS) 1The abbreviations used are: DHFR-TSdihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase6-TX6-thioxanthineFUDR5-fluorodeoxyuridineHXGPRThypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferaseMPAmycophenolic acidUPRTuracil phosphoribosyl transferasebpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase pair(s)PrPPphosphoribosylpyrophosphatentnucleotide(s)PRTphosphoribosyl transferase. gene, mutated to encode a highly pyrimethamine-resistant enzyme (Donald and Roos, 9Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Google Scholar, 10Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 243-253Google Scholar). Using this selectable marker, drug-resistant parasites containing transgenes integrated throughout the T. gondii genome (∼1-2 copies/parasite) are obtained at sufficiently high frequency to make insertional mutagenesis feasible (Donald and Roos, 10Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 243-253Google Scholar, 11Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5749-5753Google Scholar). The availability of genetic selection schemes for mutations in nonessential nucleotide salvage pathway enzymes (Pfefferkorn, 43Pfefferkorn E.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1978; 44: 26-35Google Scholar; Pfefferkorn and Pfefferkorn, 47Pfefferkorn E.R. Pfefferkorn L.C. J.

Parasitol. 1994; 79: 374-382Google Scholar) has provided suitable targets to directly assess the frequency and randomness of chromosomal integration events. In the first validation of this system, insertional mutants defective in uracil phosphoribosyl transferase (UPRT) were obtained by 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) selection, and the UPRT gene was subsequently cloned by the direct rescue of genomic DNA flanking a single-copy transgene insertion (Donald and Roos, 11Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5749-5753Google Scholar). dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase 6-thioxanthine 5-fluorodeoxyuridine hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase mycophenolic acid uracil phosphoribosyl transferase base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction kilobase pair(s) phosphoribosylpyrophosphate nucleotide(s) phosphoribosyl transferase. We were also interested in exploiting this approach to identify the parasite hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HXGPRT) gene, both as a possible target for antiparasitic chemotherapy (Ullman and Carter, 62Ullman B. Carter D. Infect. Agents Dis. 1995; 4: 29-40Google Scholar) and because of its potential as a safe, versatile selectable marker for T. gondii transformation. Toxoplasma tachyzoites deficient in HXGPRT activity can be selected in the presence of 6-thioxanthine (6-TX), whereas strains expressing HXGPRT activity can be selected in mycophenolic acid (MPA; Pfefferkorn and Borotz, 45Pfefferkorn E.R. Borotz S. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 374-382Google Scholar). In this report we describe (i) cloning of the T. gondii HXGPRT gene by insertional mutagenesis, (ii) mapping and analysis of transgene insertion sites, (iii) identification of differentially spliced cDNAs predicted to encode two HXGPRT isoforms, (iv) bacterial overexpression, purification, and preliminary characterization of the recombinant enzymes, (v) production of defined HXGPRT knock-out parasites, and (vi) the feasibility of both positive and negative selection for/against HXGPRT activity in transgenic parasites. Vectors, libraries, and parasite strains described herein are available free of charge through the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Ogden BioServices Corp, Rockville MD; [email protected]). All experiments were carried out using a clonal isolate of the virulent T. gondii strain RH. Procedures for routine parasite maintenance, cloning, transfection, and insertional mutagenesis have been described elsewhere (Roos et al., 49Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Google Scholar; Donald and Roos, 11Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5749-5753Google Scholar). Negative selections for HXGPRT-deficient parasites were carried out using 80 µg/ml 6-TX. Positive selections for HXGPRT+ parasites were carried out in 25 µg/ml MPA supplemented with 50 µg/ml xanthine to ensure sufficient substrate for the enzyme. 6-TX, MPA, and xanthine were obtained from Sigma. Parasites were transfected with plasmid pTgDHFR-TSc3/M2M3 (Ogden Bioservices catalog number 2854), which harbors a cDNA-derived T. gondii DHFR-TS minigene mutated to produce a pyrimethamine-resistant allele (Donald and Roos, 9Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Google Scholar, 10Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 243-253Google Scholar). This vector integrates throughout the parasite genome by nonhomologous recombination, conferring resistance to >1 µM pyrimethamine (Donald and Roos, 9Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Google Scholar, 11Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5749-5753Google Scholar). ∼2 × 107 freshly harvested tachyzoites were electroporated with 50 µg of undigested or HindIII-linearized plasmid and inoculated onto a monolayer of human foreskin fibroblast fibroblasts in 25-cm2 T-flasks containing growth medium supplemented with 1 µM pyrimethamine to enrich for parasites expressing the DHFR-TS transgene. After 2–3 days, parasites emerging spontaneously from the lysed host cell monolayer were inoculated into multiple 175-cm2 T-flasks containing 80 µg/ml 6-TX in addition to pyrimethamine. Flasks containing healthy parasites after 1–2 weeks in drug were passaged under continued selection for two further cycles of growth to ensure stable drug resistance and parasite tachyzoites cloned by limiting dilution (Roos et al., 49Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Google Scholar). Genomic DNA downstream of the pDHFR-TSc3 transgene insertion points in 6-TX-resistant clones 2 and 3 was recovered by EcoRI digestion of total DNA, intramolecular ligation under dilute conditions, and direct transformation into Escherichia coli as described previously (Donald and Roos, 11Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5749-5753Google Scholar). The upstream junction from 6-TXR mutant 2 was subsequently cloned in the pCR-II vector (Invitrogen) as a 760-bp fragment by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using an HXGPRT-specific sense-strand primer H3 (5′-GCCTACCAACTTTTCCCTAACGT-3′) upstream of the insertion point and an antisense primer homologous to the 5′ end of the HindIII-linearized pDHFR-TSc3 transformation vector (TS49; 5′-GTTACACGTGACCACGCCAAAGT-3′). A similar PCR-based strategy was used to recover the upstream vector junction in 6-TXR clone 3, where multiple copies of the transgene integrated at the insertion site. Because the terminal transgenes in this array are in opposite orientation, pKS Reverse Primer was used to amplify both a 1.2-kb upstream and a 2.5-kb downstream PCR fragment using primers H3 (see above) or H11 (5′-GTGTTGTTCTCACCTGCAGTGTC-3′), respectively. Flanking sequences from both sides of the insertion junction in FUDRR mutant 3 (Donald and Roos, 11Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5749-5753Google Scholar) were recovered by marker rescue using the restriction enzyme NcoI, which does not cut within the insertional mutagenesis plasmid. DNA manipulations, hybridizations, etc. were performed according to standard procedures (Maniatis et al., 32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Sequencing was carried out using double-stranded plasmid and Sequenase-modified T7 polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.; Kraft et al. (28Kraft R. Tardiff J. Krauter K.S. Leinwand L.A. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 544-547Google Scholar)). HXGPRT λ clones were screened from T. gondii genomic and cDNA libraries in λ DASH-II and λ ZAP-II vectors, respectively (vectors from Stratagene; libraries available as Ogden Bioservices catalog numbers 1896, 2861, and 2862). Genomic HXGPRT clones used in expression studies were constructed using restriction fragments isolated from overlapping λ clones and subcloned into pKS (Stratagene). Clone pTgHXGPRTg8 contains a 6.7-kb BamHI fragment including the entire known HXGPRT transcription unit (3.0 kb, including introns), along with 2.7- and 1.0-kb of 5′- and 3′-flanking DNA, respectively. The complete sequence of this region has been deposited in. A gene targeting construct was produced by ligating a 5.8-kb 5′ genomic fragment (extending from the 5′ end of a λ clone upstream of the gene through a SalI restriction site within the HXGPRT coding sequence) to a 5.5-kb 3′ SalI genomic fragment from downstream of the HXGPRT gene. The resulting 11.3-kb construct,pTgHXGPRTg11ΔSal (Ogden Bioservices catalog number 2856), lacks an internal 1.5-kb SalI fragment, which is predicted to encode the COOH-terminal 82 amino acids of the HXGPRT enzyme. pSK phagemids were recovered from purified λ ZAP-II cDNA clones encoding T. gondii HXGPRT, using the ExAssist/SOLR system (Stratagene). Two differentially spliced classes of cDNA predicted to encode two HXGPRT isoforms were identified. Minigene constructs pTgHXGPRTcI and pTgHXGPRTcII were created by adding 554 bp of genomic sequence from upstream of the first known cDNA 5′ end to clones from each cDNA class using a common KpnI site located 156 bp 5′ to the presumed translational start site. To facilitate the construction of heterologous promoter fusions, restriction sites were engineered into cDNA clones at the 5′ end of the HXGPRT coding region by site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel, 29Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar; McClary et al., 34McClary J.A. Witney F. Geisselsoder J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 282-289Google Scholar). For bacterial expression, oligonucleotide HM2 (5′-CTAACGTGAAGCCATATGGCGTCCAAACCC-3′) was employed to introduce an NdeI site (bold) at the initiation codon (italicized). Taking advantage of a fortuitous NdeI restriction site 7 bp downstream of the termination codon, a 702-bp NdeI fragment encoding HXGPRT isoform I and a 849-bp NdeI fragment encoding HXGPRT isoform II were cloned into the E. coli expression vector pBAce (Craig et al., 8Craig S.P. Yuan L. Kuntz D.A. McKerrow J.H. Wang C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2500-2504Google Scholar). For expression in transgenic parasites, oligonucleotide HM3 (5′-ACCAACTTTTCCCTAGGATCCAGCAAAATGGCGTCCAAACCC-3′) was used to introduce a BamHI site (bold), preserving the immediate context of the initiation codon (italicized). BamHI to NdeI fragments encoding HXGPRT-I or HXGPRT-II were placed under control of minimal promoter and 3′-untranslated regions derived from the T. gondii DHFR-TS gene 2A. L. C. Moulton and D. S. Roos, unpublished observations. by replacing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase cassette in pminCAT (Ogden Bioservices Corp catalog number 2850). Plasmid constructs pBAce-TgHXGPRT-I and pBAce-HXGPRT-II (or pBAce alone, as a control) were transformed into E. coli strains genetically deficient in hypoxanthine, xanthine, and guanine phosphoribosylation (Sφ606: pro-gpt-lac, thi, hpt; Sφ609: gpt-pro-lac, thi, hpt, pup, purH, purJ, strA; Jochimsen et al., 24Jochimsen B. Nygaard P. Vestergaard T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 143: 85-91Google Scholar) and induced by growth in low phosphate medium as described (Allen and Ullman, 1Allen T.E. Ullman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5431-5438Google Scholar). Recombinant HXGPRT proteins were purified by GTP-agarose affinity chromatography and elution with 1.0 mM phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PrPP) (Allen and Ullman, 1Allen T.E. Ullman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5431-5438Google Scholar, 2Allen T.E. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 233-245Google Scholar). Alternatively (for HXGPRT-I only), E. coli were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol (TMD-50). Cells were lysed in a French press at 16,000 psi, and debris was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 30,000 × g. The supernatant was chromatographed on a DEAE-cellulose (Sigma D-8382) column, and unbound protein was precipitated with (NH4)2SO4 at 65% saturation. Pelleted protein was resuspended in TMD-50 containing 10% glycerol, and salt was removed by gel sieving on a Sephadex G-100 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Proteins were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and HXGPRT activity was measured as described previously (Allen and Ullman, 1Allen T.E. Ullman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5431-5438Google Scholar). HXGPRT activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of [2,8-3H]hypoxanthine, [8-3H]xanthine, or [8-3H]guanine (Moravek Biochemicals) by T. gondii-infected cultures of HGPRT-deficient human fibroblasts (Mi-Ten cells, from a patient with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome; American Type Culture Collection, CRL 1113). Transiently or stably transfected HXGPRT− knock-out parasites (see below) were inoculated into confluent host cell monolayers grown in 24-well tissue culture dishes at 37°C (105 parasite tachyzoites/well). 24 h post-infection, 1 µCi of radiolabel was added to each well, and incubation was continued for 4 h before the monolayers were fixed with trichloroacetic acid, rinsed, and counted as described (Pfefferkorn and Guyre, 46Pfefferkorn E.R. Guyre P.M. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 211-216Google Scholar; Roos et al., 49Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Google Scholar). Experiments were carried out in triplicate in parallel with mock-infected and wild-type parasite controls. Crude sonicated extracts from transfected parasites were also assayed for HXGPRT activity by incubating labeled hypoxanthine, xanthine, and guanine with PrPP and quantitating the reaction products separated by ascending paper chromatography (Pfefferkorn and Borotz, 45Pfefferkorn E.R. Borotz S. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 374-382Google Scholar). Predicted H(X)GPRT protein sequences were downloaded from GenBank™, EMBL, SwissProt, and PIR data bases using the NCBI “retrieve” E-mail server (Henikoff, 20Henikoff S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 267-268Google Scholar) and Network Entrez (Schuler et al., 53Schuler G.D. Epstein J.A. Ohkawa H. Kans J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Sequences were aligned using MACAW and ClustalW software (Schuler et al., 52Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proteins. 1991; 9: 180-190Google Scholar; Thompson et al., 60Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar) with manual adjustment. Unambiguously aligned loci were analyzed using heuristic search algorithms in PAUP 3.0s software (Swofford, 59Swofford D.L. PAUP: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony. Illinois Natural History Survey, Champaign, IL1991Google Scholar) and subjected to bootstrap analysis (Hillis and Bull, 22Hillis D.M. Bull J.J. Syst. Biol. 1993; 42: 182-192Google Scholar) using 100 replicates. Studies by 45Pfefferkorn E.R. Borotz S. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 374-382Google Scholar have demonstrated that T. gondii parasites deficient in HXGPRT activity are viable, presumably synthesizing guanine nucleotides via AMP deaminase. We therefore sought to clone the parasite's HXGPRT gene by insertional mutagenesis, followed by selection with 6-TX (this subversive substrate is specific for the parasite enzyme, because the mammalian host cells lack xanthine phosphoribosyl transferase activity). Freshly harvested tachyzoites were electroporated with insertional mutagenesis vector pDHFR-TSc3/M2M3 (Donald and Roos, 9Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11703-11707Google Scholar, 11Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5749-5753Google Scholar) and mutant clones resistant to 6-TX isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At least four independent 6-TX-resistant mutants were obtained from two mutagenesis experiments. Clone 1 was capable of growth in MPA + xanthine and exhibited wild-type HXGPRT activity, but clones 2, 3 and 4 were sensitive to MPA + xanthine, consistent with the phenotype of a known HXGPRT mutant (previously isolated by direct selection of chemically mutagenized parasites; 45Pfefferkorn E.R. Borotz S. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 374-382Google Scholar). Assays of crude cell extracts confirmed that these clones lacked HXGPRT activity (not shown). Clones 2 and 3 were produced using linearized vector DNA, which typically integrates as a single unrearranged unit, facilitating retrieval of flanking DNA by “marker rescue” through restriction of total genomic DNA, self-ligation, and direct transformation of E. coli (Roos et al., 49Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Google Scholar; Donald and Roos, 11Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5749-5753Google Scholar). Hybridization analysis indicated that an EcoRI rescue strategy should be feasible, and recombinant plasmids containing genomic sequences flanking the insertion points for 6-TXR clones 2 and 3 were obtained by direct transformation of E. coli with self-ligated, EcoRI-digested DNA. These clones contained T. gondii genomic DNA exhibiting high homology to H(X)GPRT genes from other organisms (see below). Probing bacteriophage λ libraries identified overlapping genomic clones and two distinct classes of differentially spliced HXGPRT cDNA clones, as shown in Fig. 1A. The first intron of class I cDNAs (represented by five clones) was not eliminated in the class II cDNA (represented by a single clone). This intron is predicted to lie within the 5′-untranslated region and hence should not affect the enzyme's amino acid sequence. (Introns within the 5′-untranslated region have been reported in T. gondii previously (Parmley et al., 41Parmley S.F. Yang S. Harth G. Sibley L.D. Sucharczuk A. Remington J.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 66: 283-296Google Scholar).) Class II cDNA also contains an additional 147-nt exon within the second intron of class I. This exon is predicted to encode a 49-amino acid insertion near the amino terminus of the mature protein (asterisk in Fig. 2). All cDNA clones (including five shorter clones consistent with either class) were in perfect agreement with the genomic sequence except for polyadenylylation at the 3′ terminus and elimination of intervening sequences; Southern blotting indicates the presence of only a single gene (not shown). Conceptual translation of these cDNAs reveals that the T. gondii locus identified by insertional mutagenesis is predicted to encode proteins with molecular weights of 26,369 and 31,464 (for HXGPRT-I and HXGPRT-II, respectively). The predicted sequence is similar to H(X)GPRT enzymes from other species, as shown in Fig. 2A. Sequence conservation is highest within the putative PrPP-binding domain (Hershey and Taylor, 21Hershey H.V. Taylor M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 43: 287-293Google Scholar). Interestingly, the T. gondii sequence differs substantially from other H(X)GPRT enzymes in a signature sequence near the COOH terminus that is thought to be part of the purine binding domain (Eads et al., 12Eads J.C. Scapin G. Xu Y. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C. Cell. 1994; 78: 325-334Google Scholar): the eukaryotic consensus sequence (F/Y)(V/I)(V/I)G(Y/F)(A/G)(L/M)D(Y/F), preserved in organisms as diverse as mammals and Tritrichomonas foetus, is replaced with the sequence WIVGCCYDF in T. gondii. The loss of this otherwise well conserved region may explain the difficulty several groups have had in identifying the T. gondii HXGPRT gene by PCR. The novel exon present only in cDNA class II introduces 49 amino acids near the poorly conserved NH2 terminus and shows no significant homology to other H(X)GPRTs (or any other sequence in the data base). Phylogenetic analysis of unambiguously aligned regions demonstrates that the predicted T. gondii HXGPRT sequence is most closely related to Plasmodium falciparum (Fig. 2B), also a member of the phylum Apicomplexan (Wolters, 64Wolters J. Biosystems. 1991; 25: 75-93Google Scholar; Gagnon et al., 17Gagnon S. Levesque R.C. Sogin M.L. Gajadhar A.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 145-148Google Scholar; Cavalier-Smith, 7Cavalier-Smith T. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 953-994Google Scholar). The unrooted tree shown in Fig. 2B is the single most parsimonious tree found and is identical to the consensus of the 114 shortest trees. All groupings were supported by bootstrap analysis, although the clustering of Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi is relatively weak. The shortest tree in which the T. brucei branch is deep to a clade containing T. cruzi, Leishmania, and Crithidia (Fernandes et al., 16Fernandes A.P. Nelson K. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11608-11612Google Scholar; Vickerman, 63Vickerman K. Int. J. Parasitol. 1994; 24: 1317-1331Google Scholar) is only one step shorter than the tree shown, and this alternative topology is supported by 47% of bootstrap replicates. In order to map the location of transgene insertions, DNA from wild-type parasites and each of the four 6-TXR mutants was hybridized with a probe spanning the HXGPRT coding sequence (Fig. 1B). Digestion with both EcoRI and PstI cuts the wild-type HXGPRT gene into three restriction fragments of 1.38, 0.77, and 0.73 kb. Mutant 1 (which showed normal HXGPRT activity) retains the wild-type hybridization pattern. Each of the three HXGPRT-deficient mutants displays a disrupted band; however, transgene integration occurred within the middle (0.73-kb) fragment in 6-TXR clone 2 and within the 3′ (1.38-kb) fragment in 6-TXR clones 3 and 4. Thus the three transgene integrations occurred in at least two different locations within the HXGPRT locus. To examine the structure of transgene integrations more precisely, junction regions from 6-TXR clones 2 and 3 and an unrelated integration at the UPRT locus (FUDRR clone 3; 11Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5749-5753Google Scholar) were cloned and sequenced, as shown in Fig. 3. All of these insertions were produced using HindIII-linearized vector in order to facilitate cloning (see “Experimental Procedures”); no junctions have been sequenced from insertional mutants produced using circular plasmids (e.g., 6-TX 4). Insertions in 6-TXR clones 2 and 3 map to intron III and exon IV of the T. gondii HXGPRT gene, respectively (Fig. 1A). FUDRR clone 3 occurred within UPRT exon IV, near the intron IV boundary; as at the HXGPRT locus, other mutants (not precisely mapped) harbor integrations at different sites throughout the UPRT gene (Donald and Roos, 11Donald R.G.K. Roos D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5749-5753Google Scholar). Small deletions (4–31 nt; 4 nt of which were single-stranded DNA produced by HindIII digestion) were observed at vector termini, presumably the result of exonuclease activity prior to insertional ligation. Deletions of 3 or 6 nt were observed at the genomic integration site in clones 6-TX 2 and 3, respectively. Integration at the UPRT locus occurred at an endogenous HindIII site and was accompanied by a 5-nt duplication. It is unlikely that this duplication was produced by filling in the ends of the transfected plasmid, because both ends of the integrated plasmid were truncated. We also consider it unlikely that this integration event was catalyzed by exogenous restriction enzyme, because HindIII was removed from digested plasmid by ethanol precipitation and washing prior to electroporation.

The Ang II-induced MAPK activation was not affected by the protein kinase C inhibitor, GF109203X, and was only partially impaired by pretreatment with a phorbol ester, whereas both treatments completely prevented MAPK activation by the phorbol ester. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation by TMB-8, but not extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation or inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, abolished Ang II-induced MAPK activation. The calmodulin inhibitor, calmidazolium, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, completely blocked MAPK activation by Ang II as well as by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore A23187. Ang II caused a rapid increase in the binding of GTP to p21<sup>ras</sup>, and this was inhibited by genistein, TMB-8, and calmidazolium but not by pertussis toxin or GF109203X. These data suggest that Ang II-induced MAPK activation through the Ang II type 1 receptor could be mediated by p21<sup>ras</sup> activation through a currently unidentified tyrosine kinase that lies downstream of G<sub>q</sub>-coupled Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin signals."

https://openalex.org/W2086383194,"Nonsteroidal agent tamoxifen (Tam), a therapeutic/chemopreventive agent for breast cancer, inhibits protein kinase C (PKC), which is considered to be one of its extra-estrogen receptor sites of action. This drug is required at higher (>100 µM) concentrations to inhibit PKC in the test tube, whereas it is required at lower (1-10 µM) concentrations to induce inhibition of cell growth in estrogen receptor-negative cell types. To identify additional mechanisms of action of Tam on PKC and cell growth, studies with MDA-MB-231, an estrogen receptor-negative breast carcinoma cell type, have been carried out. Upon treatment with 5-20 µM Tam, a cytosol to membrane translocation of PKC occurred within 30 min, which was then followed by a down-regulation of the enzyme within 2 h. A transient generation of Ca2+/lipid-independent activated form of PKC was observed during this period. Rapidly growing cells require nearly 2-3-fold lower concentrations (2-5 µM) of Tam than do confluent cells to induce changes in PKC. Furthermore, phorbol ester binding observed with intact cells also decreased in Tam-treated cells only under the conditions PKC was inactivated. Unlike phorbol esters, Tam did not directly support the membrane association of PKC. The release of arachidonic acid correlated with the PKC membrane translocation. Studies carried out with [3H]Tam revealed that Tam partitioned into the membrane, and there was no appreciable covalent association of [3H]Tam with cellular proteins within this limited time period (2 h). Various antioxidants (vitamin E, vitamin C, β-carotene, catalase, and superoxide dismutase) inhibited all these cellular effects of Tam. Moreover, vitamin E strikingly blocked Tam-induced growth inhibition. To determine whether oxymetabolites of Tam can affect PKC permanently, OH-Tam was tested with purified PKC. In contrast to Tam, which reversibly inhibited PKC, OH-Tam permanently inactivated the enzyme by modifying the catalytic domain at lower concentrations. The vicinal thiols present within this domain were found to be required to induce this inactivation. This effect was partially blocked by various antioxidants. This is the first report showing the role of oxidative stress in mediating the actions of Tam. Taken together these results suggest that Tam, by initially partitioning into the membranes, induces a generation of transmembrane signals and an oxidative stress to elicit the membrane association of PKC, followed by an irreversible activation, and subsequent down-regulation of this enzyme, which, in part, may lead to cell growth inhibition.

The antiproliferative actions of Tam and other triphenylethylene derivatives at submicromolar concentrations in estrogen-dependent breast carcinoma cells are believed to be mediated by high affinity binding to the estrogen receptor (ER) (4Dickson R.B.

Furthermore, it inhibits growth of other cell types, which have no ER, in some cases at nanomolar concentrations (11Croxtall J.D. Emmas C. White J.O. Choudhary Q. Flower R.J. Biochem.

Binding to so-called anti-estrogen sites and the inhibitions of calmodulin and protein kinase C (PKC) are considered to be some known additional sites of action of Tam-related agents (12Sudo K.

Since PKC may play a crucial role in the signal transduction that influences cell growth and transformation (17Nishizuka Y.

Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the observation of the inhibition of PKC by Tam has gained considerable attention. Purified PKC has been shown to be reversibly inhibited by Tam-related agents in the test tube (15O'Brian C.A. Liskamp R.M. Solomon D.H. Weinstein I.B.

This inhibition seems to involve a number of different mechanisms including binding of the drug to phospholipids that are required for activation, binding to the catalytic domain at ATP-binding site, and binding to the regulatory domain (15O'Brian C.A. Liskamp R.M. Solomon D.H. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2362-2365Google Scholar, 16Su H. Mazzel G. Yogler W.R. Kuo J.F. Biochem.

Moreover, the modes of action have been found to be slightly different for individual types of triphenylethylene anti-estrogens tested (22Bignon E. Pons M. Gilbert J. Nishizuka Y. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The metabolites of Tam, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OH-Tam) and N-demethyltamoxifen, have also been shown to inhibit PKC in a reversible manner (23O'Brian C.A. Liskamp R.M. Solomon D.H. Weinstein I.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1986; 76: 1243-1246PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibition of PKC in the test tube requires higher concentrations of Tam (IC50 100 µM) (15O'Brian C.A. Liskamp R.M. Solomon D.H. Weinstein I.B. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2362-2365Google Scholar), while the ER-independent cell growth inhibition requires only 1-5 µM Tam. This raises the possibility that Tam induces growth inhibition at this low concentrations by acting on cellular targets other than PKC and/or by inducing other cellular mechanism(s), which may complement its action at PKC. We have been involved in studies of regulation of PKC by oxygen radicals and thiol modifying agents (24Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 134-148Google Scholar, 25Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H Gundimeda U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12233-12237Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Such studies also facilitated understanding of the mechanisms of inactivation of PKC by its commonly used inhibitors, calphostin C, hypericin, and chelerythrine. These inhibitors induce an irreversible inactivation of PKC either involving oxygen radical production or alkylating mechanisms (24Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 134-148Google Scholar). PKC inhibitors are classified based on their site of action, either related to regulatory or to catalytic domains. Based on the mechanism of action, these inhibitors also can be classified as reversible inhibitors or irreversible inactivators (24Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 134-148Google Scholar). However, in order to identify irreversible inhibitors, it is not only necessary to evaluate them using an isolated enzyme in the test tube, it is also important to study them in intact cells. A reversible inhibitor in test tube could become an irreversible inactivator after metabolic activation. This is especially important for Tam, which is known to be oxidatively metabolized in the cell and can form reactive metabolites that can covalently bind to DNA and proteins (26Han X. Liehr J.G.

Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 2197-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Tamoxifen also has been shown to stimulate the Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent PKC activity in test tube at high concentrations of Ca2+ (30Cooney R.V. Pung A. Harwood P.J. Boynton A.L. Zhang L. Hossain M.H. Betram J.S. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Unlike in test tubes, where Tam inhibited PKC-mediated phosphorylation of proteins, with intact cells Tam did not inhibit phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of endogenous proteins, but instead by itself stimulated the phosphorylation of some endogenous proteins (31Issandou M. Faucher C. Bayard F. Darbon J.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5845-5850PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that staurosporine, an inhibitor for PKC in a test tube, could function as an activator of PKC in intact cells inducing the membrane translocation of PKC (32Yoshizawa S. Fujiki H. Suguri H. Suganuma M. Nakayasu M. Matsushima R. Sugimura T. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4974-4978PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H.

Staurosporine also induced a release of arachidonic acid, which is a common effect induced by a variety of structurally unrelated tumor promoters (32Yoshizawa S. Fujiki H. Suguri H. Suganuma M. Nakayasu M. Matsushima R. Sugimura T. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4974-4978PubMed Google Scholar, 35Fischer S.M. Furstenberger G. Marks F. Slaga T.J. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3174-3179PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, in the mouse skin carcinogenesis model, staurosporine acts as a tumor promoter (32Yoshizawa S. Fujiki H. Suguri H. Suganuma M. Nakayasu M. Matsushima R. Sugimura T. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4974-4978PubMed Google Scholar, 33Dlugosz A.A. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4677-4684PubMed Google Scholar). In this contest it is noteworthy that Tam acts as a chemopreventive agent in mammary carcinogenesis, while it can also induce uterine cancer in humans as well as liver cancer in rats (10Jordan V.C.

Therefore, it is important to extend the studies of Tam to intact cells to understand whether it directly or after metabolic activation can influence PKC or the upstream signal transduction mechanisms in a bimodel manner. However, to date, such studies have not been carried out with Tam in intact cells. In this report we show that Tam and other related agents at low (1-10 µM) concentrations can induce the membrane association of PKC, the irreversible activation and the subsequent down-regulation of the enzyme involving the generation of transmembrane signals, and oxidative regulation in a ER-negative breast cancer cell line, MBA-MB-231. Unlike Tam, which inhibits PKC in a reversible way, at least one of its oxymetabolites, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OH-Tam), can induce an irreversible oxidative inactivation of the isolated kinase, probably by interacting with the vicinal thiols present within the catalytic domain. Tamoxifen (trans) citrate, catalase from bovine liver, and superoxide dismutase from bovine liver were obtained from Sigma. Vitamin E (D-α-tocopherol) and β-carotene were from Fluka. [N-methyl-3H]Tamoxifen citrate (specific activity 84 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp.; [20-3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (specific activity 20 Ci/mmol), and myo-[2-3H]inositol (specific activity 17.5 Ci/mmol) [5,6,8,9,11,12,14-3H]arachidonic acid (specific activity 210 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN; [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 20 Ci/mmol), [methyl-3H]thymidine (specific activity 20 Ci/mmol), and 45CaCl2 (specific activity 12 mCi/mg Ca) were from ICN. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen was a generous gift from Besins Iscovesco Laboratories, Paris. Human breast carcinoma cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Rabbit brain PKC (a mixture of α, β, and γ isoenzymes) was purified as described previously (24Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 134-148Google Scholar). Unless otherwise mentioned, unfractionated mixture of these Ca2+-dependent isoenzymes of PKC was used for modification studies. In some cases individual isoenzymes separated by hydroxylapatite (39Huang K. Huang F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were used. The catalytic and regulatory domains were separated after treating PKC with a low (1 µg/ml) concentration of trypsin (19Nakadade T. Jeng A.Y. Blumberg P.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 1541-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 100-mm Petri dishes in minimal essential medium with Earl's salts (MEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. Either subconfluent (25%) or confluent cells were changed to fresh serum-free MEM and incubated with various concentrations of Tam, OH-Tam, or control vehicle (ethanol) for the indicated periods of time at 37°C. Then the soluble and detergent-solubilized membrane fractions were prepared from the treated cells and subjected to DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described previously (40Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Wilson J.C. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Ca2+/phospholipid-stimulated PKC activity (proform) was eluted using 0.1 M NaCl (peak A) and the Ca2+/phospholipid-independent and the modified PKC activity was eluted with 0.25 M NaCl (peak B). The assays of PKC as well as cAMP-dependent protein kinase were carried out in 96-well plates with fitted filtration discs made of Durapore membranes (40Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Wilson J.C. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, PKC reaction samples containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.33 mM CaCl2, 0.1 mM ATP, histone H1 (0.1 mg/ml), 0.04 µM leupeptin, and 25 µl of PKC sample in a total volume of 125 µl were incubated at 30°C for 5 min. PKC activity was expressed as units, where 1 unit of enzyme transfers 1 nmol of phosphate to histone H1/min at 30°C. Since protein phosphatase 2A activity was high in the peak B fraction, microcystin-LR (100 nM) was included during PKC assay to obtain a reliable measure of histone H1 phosphotransferase activity in this fraction. [3H]Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) was used as a ligand for the determination of phorbol ester binding, using the multiwell filtration approach (40Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Wilson J.C. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For optimal PDBu binding to purified PKC, the conditions discussed in method 1, described previously, were used (40Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Wilson J.C. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine the optimal PDBu binding to PKC fraction that was isolated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography from the crude cell extracts, the conditions standardized with the cytosolic receptor (method 2) were used (40Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Wilson J.C. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 35-mm Petri dishes. Sets of three Petri dishes were used for determining specific and nonspecific bindings. The medium was changed to a fresh MEM (no serum), and then the cells were treated with various concentrations of Tam for a 2-h time period. Then 37.5 nM [3H]PDBu (0.25 µCi) was added to the medium and cells were further incubated for 45 min. For determining nonspecific binding 10 µM unlabeled PDBu was included with radiolabel. After incubations, cells were washed four times with ice-cold saline and lysed with 0.2 M NaOH, and the radioactivity present in the cell extract was determined. The specific binding was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the observed total binding. Whether Tam or OH-Tam induce chelator-stable membrane association of PKC in the homogenates or with isolated membrane using purified PKC was determined using previously described procedures (41Gopalakrishna R. Barsky S.H. Thomas T.P. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16438-16445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, crude cell homogenates were incubated with Tam or OH-Tam (10 µM) or PMA (100 nM) in the presence of 0.1 mM CaCl2 at room temperature for 10 min. Then EGTA was added to the homogenate, and the membrane and cytosolic fractions were separated to determine PKC activity associated with these fractions. Similarly, experiments were conducted using the isolated membrane and purified PKC. Subconfluent cells (10-15 × 106) were incubated with 25 µM [3H]Tam (3.75 µCi) for a 2-h period at 37°C in a serum-free MEM to allow substantial inactivation of PKC. Then, under these conditions, whether Tam covalently bound to protein or not was determined. The cells treated with [3H]Tam were washed four times with saline and then scrapped into 10 ml of saline and collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was then lysed with 3 ml of cold acetone by sonication, and then the protein was allowed to precipitate by keeping it at −10°C for 30 min. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation. The protein pellet was washed twice with each organic solvent, acetone, n-hexane, and methanol. The washed protein pellet was suspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer without mercaptocompounds and heated at 100°C for 3 min to solubilize the protein, and then the radioactivity was counted. To determine a covalent binding of [3H]Tam to PKC, the detergent-solubilized cell extract was prepared from the cells treated with [3H]Tam and it was subjected to the centrifuge column technique to remove free Tam. The protein fraction was incubated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against PKC (mixture of α, β, and γ) at 30°C for 4 h, and then the antibody-PKC complex was isolated by incubation with protein A-Sepharose, followed by centrifugation. From the Sepharose beads, protein was extracted with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and the radioactivity was counted. Initially mercaptocompounds present within the PKC preparation were removed by using a PD-10 gel filtration column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The column chromatography also facilitated the exchange of buffer in PKC preparation to buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 150 nM pepstatin, 1 µM leupeptin. PKC (approximately 1-1.5 units) was incubated with various concentrations of Tam or OH-Tam in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 in a total volume of 0.5 ml for 10 min at 37°C. Then 25 µl of bovine serum albumin solution (10 mg/ml) and 25 µl of 0.1 M EDTA in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, were added. 2While chelating high concentrations of Ca2+ with EDTA, it is important to use high strength alkaline buffer (pH 8) to neutralize the acid released during this process. Tam and other low molecular weight compounds present in the treated PKC samples were removed by subjecting them to the centrifuge column technique using Sephadex G-50 (24Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 134-148Google Scholar). The used Sephadex G-50 columns were washed with 2 bed volumes of ethanol to remove the trapped Tam in the gel and then equilibrated with buffer. This ethanol wash to remove Tam that retained within the gel was required to reuse the column, which otherwise would result in a low recovery of PKC from the column upon subsequent reuse. Cells were grown to subconfluence or confluence in a regular medium in 96-well plates. The medium was then replaced with MEM with 0.1% serum and [3H] arachidonic acid, 0.5 µCi/ml medium, and the cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. Then the cells were washed four times with MEM medium. The labeled cells (four wells for each point) were incubated with MEM supplemented with 0.1% serum along with various concentrations of Tam. At the indicated periods of time, the medium was transferred from the wells of the culture plate to appropriate wells in a 96-well filtration plate fitted with Durapore membrane filtration disks. Then the samples were filtered into an ordinary 96-well plate by using a minivacuum manifold (Millipore). The filters removed any radiolabeled cells that were detached during the incubation of the cells. The radioactivity present in the filtrates was then counted. Initially, MDA-MB-231 cells were grown to confluence in 96-well plates. The serum-containing medium was removed. Then serum-free MEM containing 45CaCl2 (2.5 µCi/ml) along with various concentrations of Tam was added to the wells, and the cells were incubated at 37°C. At various time intervals, the medium was quickly removed and then the cells were washed three times with 150 µl of MEM containing 1 mM LaCl3. Then the cells were lysed with 0.2 M NaOH, and the radioactivity retained within the cell was counted. Cells were grown in 35-mm Petri dishes and labeled overnight with myo-[2-3H]inositol (10 µCi/ml) in a inositol-free MEM supplemented with dialyzed FCS (5%). Cells were washed and treated with various concentrations of Tam for given periods of time in a serum-free MEM supplemented with 10 mM LiCl. The treated cells were then washed and extracted with perchloric acid. From the neutralized perchloric acid extracts, inositol phosphates were separated by ion-exchange chromatography using Dowex-1 (42Downes C.P. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The size of the intracellular thymidine pool was shown to be reduced by Tam, which can cause artifacts in thymidine incorporation into the cell (43Lippman M.E. Aitken S.C. Iacobelli S. Lindner H.R. King R.J.B. Lippman M.E. Hormones and Cancer. Raven Press, New York1980: 3Google Scholar). Therefore, two approaches were used to measure the cell growth rate. Cells were seeded in 96-well multiwell plate to 25% confluence in MEM supplemented with 5% FCS. After allowing the cells to attach, various concentrations of Tam were added (four wells for each point) and the cells were incubated for 48 h at 37°C. Then, from one set of multiwell plates, the medium was removed and the cells were incubated with MEM supplemented with 5% dialyzed FCS and 0.5 µCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine. After 6 h of incubation, the cells were washed four times with saline and lysed with 0.2 M NaOH and the radioactivity retained in the cells was counted. Alternatively, cells treated with Tam in another set of multiwell plates were stained with sulforhodamine B, and the absorbance was measured at 550 nm using Thermomax multiwell plate reader as a growth index (44Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8938) Google Scholar). An ER-negative cell line, MDA-MB-231, was employed to understand ER-independent effects of Tam-related agents on PKC. The changes that occurred with the treatment of Tam and OH-Tam were compared with that of tumor promoter, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In confluent cells treated in a serum-free medium with 20 µM Tam or OH-Tam, there was a substantial decrease in the activity of PKC in the cytosol fraction within 30 min (Fig. 1). A concomitant increase in the activity of PKC in the membrane fraction was found. With Tam treatment, the extent of membrane translocation of PKC was not appreciable up to 15 min. However, PMA-induced membrane association of PKC occurred within 15 min. In another experiment carried out with treatments for limited time (2 and 5 min), only PMA induced PKC translocation within these short periods of time but not Tam and OH-Tam. Thus, there was a lag period of nearly 15 min in i"

https://openalex.org/W2051222628,"The modulation of the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by endogenous growth factors or growth inhibitors provides a potential means of regulating cell proliferation. We determined the effect of the endogenous anti-proliferative peptide, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), on the ability of MAPK to phosphorylate myelin basic protein. In astrocytes, MAPK activity was significantly stimulated (up to 3-fold) by three known glial mitogens, endothelin-3, platelet-derived growth factor, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. ANP inhibited by 55–70% the ability of each of these mitogens to activate MAPK. The effects of ANP were equipotent to those caused by C-ANP 4–23, a peptide that specifically binds to the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor. Additionally, both natriuretic peptides caused a 70–80% inhibition of the sodium vanadate-stimulated MAPK activity, complete inhibition of the okadaic acid-stimulated activity, and inhibition of the mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation of MAPK. To understand the potential mechanism by which the natriuretic peptides act, we found that both ANP and C-ANP inhibited the mitogen-stimulated activity of the immediate upstream kinase in the cascade, MAPK kinase (MEK). C-ANP also strongly inhibited the endothelin-3-, platelet-derived growth factor-, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced stimulation of DNA synthesis in the astrocytes, while both okadaic acid and sodium vanadate significantly reversed these anti-proliferative actions. Our results identify ANP as a peptide hormone that inhibits growth factor-stimulated MAPK. These data suggest that the ability of the natriuretic peptides to inhibit MAPK may be important for their anti-growth actions. This effect likely occurs via the inhibition of upstream kinase(s), including MEK, uniquely resulting from ligand binding to the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor."

When U937 cells were treated with 10−8M bufalin in the absence of serum, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity was markedly increased 6 h after the start of treatment and elevated so for 12 h. Prior to the activation of MAP kinase, increased activities of Ras, Raf-1, and MAP kinase kinase were found, but these enzymes were transiently activated by the treatment with bufalin. These results suggest that the signal was transmitted sequentially from Ras, Raf-1, and MAP kinase kinase to MAP kinase. In association with this signal transduction, the concentration of cAMP in the cells decreased markedly, suggesting that Raf-1 was also activated by a decrease in the extent of phosphorylation by protein kinase A. In fact, pretreatment of U937 cells with forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, which are known to increase the concentration of cAMP in the cells, and subsequent treatment with bufalin resulted in a decrease in both Raf-1 activity and DNA fragmentation. To confirm the participation of MAP kinase in the apoptotic process, antisense cDNA for MAP kinase kinase 1 was expressed in U937 cells.

Basal concentrations of Ins(3,4,5,6)P4 (1 µM) present in the pipette solution had no significant effect on Cl− current; however, as the concentration of the polyphosphate was increased there was a corresponding reduction in anion current, with near complete inhibition at 8–10 µM Ins(3,4,5,6)P4. Corresponding levels are found in cells after sustained receptor-dependent activation of phospholipase C. The Ins(3,4,5,6)P4-induced inhibition of gClCa was isomer specific; neither Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, Ins(1,3,4,6)P4, Ins(1,4,5,6)P4, nor Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 induced current inhibition at concentrations of up to 100 µM.

In a Madin-Darby canine kidney cell model for intercellular junction assembly, TG treatment inhibited the development of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), a measure of tight junction assembly, in a dose-dependent manner. The TG-induced inhibition of tight junction assembly was paralleled by a defect in the sorting of the tight junction protein, ZO-1. An even more dramatic delay in sorting of the desmosomal protein, desmoplakin, was observed in the presence of TG. In addition, while both ZO-1 and desmoplakin-I in control cells were shown to become associated with the Triton X-100 insoluble cytoskeleton during intercellular junction assembly, prior treatment with 100 nM TG diminished this biochemical stabilization into the detergent-insoluble fraction, particularly in the case of ZO-1. Although spectrofluorimetric measurements in fura-2 loaded Madin-Darby canine kidney cells confirmed the occurrence of TG-mediated release of calcium from internal stores, total cytosolic calcium during junction assembly remained similar to untreated cells.

https://openalex.org/W2020741020,"A cluster of 18 point mutations in exon 17b of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene has been detected in patients with cystic fibrosis. These mutations cause single amino acid substitutions in the most C-terminal cytoplasmic loop (CL4, residues 1035-1102) of the CFTR chloride channel. Heterologous expression of the mutants showed that 12 produced only core-glycosylated CFTR, which was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum; the other six mutants matured and reached the cell surface. In some cases substitution of one member of pairs of adjacent residues resulted in misprocessing, whereas the other did not. Thus, the secondary structure of CL4 may contribute crucially to the proper folding of the entire CFTR molecule. Cyclic AMP-stimulated iodide efflux was not detected from cells expressing the misprocessed variants but was from the other six, indicating that their mutations cause relatively subtle channel defects. Consistent with this, these latter mutations generally are present in patients who are pancreatic-sufficient, while the processing mutants are mostly from patients who are pancreatic-insufficient. Single-channel patch-clamp analysis demonstrated that the processed mutants had the same ohmic conductance as wild-type CFTR, but a lower open probability, generally due to an increase in channel mean closed time and a reduction in mean open time. This suggests that mutations in CL4 do not affect pore properties of CFTR, but disrupt the mechanism of channel gating. A cluster of 18 point mutations in exon 17b of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene has been detected in patients with cystic fibrosis. These mutations cause single amino acid substitutions in the most C-terminal cytoplasmic loop (CL4, residues 1035-1102) of the CFTR chloride channel. Heterologous expression of the mutants showed that 12 produced only core-glycosylated CFTR, which was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum; the other six mutants matured and reached the cell surface. In some cases substitution of one member of pairs of adjacent residues resulted in misprocessing, whereas the other did not. Thus, the secondary structure of CL4 may contribute crucially to the proper folding of the entire CFTR molecule. Cyclic AMP-stimulated iodide efflux was not detected from cells expressing the misprocessed variants but was from the other six, indicating that their mutations cause relatively subtle channel defects. Consistent with this, these latter mutations generally are present in patients who are pancreatic-sufficient, while the processing mutants are mostly from patients who are pancreatic-insufficient. Single-channel patch-clamp analysis demonstrated that the processed mutants had the same ohmic conductance as wild-type CFTR, but a lower open probability, generally due to an increase in channel mean closed time and a reduction in mean open time. This suggests that mutations in CL4 do not affect pore properties of CFTR, but disrupt the mechanism of channel gating.

CFTR was predicted to form a transmembrane pore with regulatory segments protruding into the cell cytoplasm (Riordan et al., 27Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z.

Jensen T.J. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1995; 50: 125-137Google Scholar). The channel consists of two structurally similar halves, each containing six transmembrane segments (TMs) and a nucleotide binding fold (NBF) with which ATP interacts. The two halves are connected by the R-domain, rich in consensus sequences for phosphorylation by several kinases, including cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C. On the cytoplasmically exposed side of the protein the TMs are linked to each other by cytoplasmic loops (CLs), which vary between 55 and 65 amino acids in length. There is evidence that the concerted action of ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis at the NBFs (Anderson et al., 2Anderson M.P. Berger H.A. Rich D.P. Gregory R.J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 775-784Google Scholar; Hwang et al., 20Hwang T.-C. Baukrowtiz G. Nagel G. Horie A.C. Gadsby D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11304-11311Google Scholar) are necessary to allow channel activation, however, little information is available regarding the importance of the CLs in CFTR function. Only recently, a report by Xie et al. (36Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Google Scholar), which studied the effect of a 19-amino acid deletion in CL2 (residues 242–307), suggested that this region is involved in stabilizing the full conductance state of the CFTR chloride channel.The CLs are highly conserved between CFTRs expressed in different species (Diamond et al., 9Diamond G. Scanlin T.F. Zasloff M.A. Bevins C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22761-22769Google Scholar) and moderately conserved in comparison to the CLs of other ABC transporters (Manavalan et al., 23Manavalan P. Smith A.E. McPherson J.M. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 279-290Google Scholar). Their possible significance is highlighted by the fact that 20% of all identified CF-associated mutations lie within CLs. Thus far in CF patients, 18 different point mutations have been described in exon 17b, which approximately corresponds to CL4 (amino acids 1035-1142); however, as yet the mechanistic impact of alterations in this segment of CFTR on its function and biosynthetic processing has not been investigated. The detailed analysis of amino acid substitutions in other CFTR domains has shown that the CF phenotype usually is attributable to either a lack of the channel at the cell surface or the production of a channel with impaired function (Welsh and Smith, 33Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Cell. 1993; 73: 1251-1254Google Scholar). The failure of many mutant forms of CFTR, including the most frequent ΔF508 variant, to be biosynthetically processed beyond the core-glycosylated form present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), has become a hallmark of CFTR (Cheng et al., 7Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. O'Riordan C.R. Smith A.E. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Google Scholar) and the focus of intense research. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of mutations in CL4 on processing, intracellular transport, and chloride channel activity of CFTR.DISCUSSIONCurrent models of CFTR suggest that the molecule utilizes three major cytoplasmic domains (NBF-1, NBF-2, and the R-domain) in the regulation of its chloride channel activity (Hanrahan et al., 18Hanrahan J.W. Mathews C.J. Grygorczyk R. Tabcharani J.A. Grzelczak Z. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. J. Exp. Zool. 1996; 275 (in press)Google Scholar). An additional set of cytoplasmic domains is constituted by four fairly large CLs, connecting the TMs on the cytoplasmic side of the protein; little is known about their function. It would not be surprising if these loops also were involved in regulation of channel activity due to their position close to the putative pore-forming TM segments and their potential proximity to the major regulatory domains. Such a general view is consistent with the recent findings of Xie et al. (36Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Google Scholar) who concluded from studies of a 19-residue deletion variant (amino acids 266–284) that CL2 is required to stabilize the full conductance state of the CFTR chloride channel. For the investigation presented here, a different strategy was applied to study CLs. Eighteen CF-associated point mutations in CL4 were reconstructed to determine which cause CF, because the channel cannot reach the plasma membrane, and which cause disease due to defective functioning at the cell surface.Previous studies have shown that many mutations in CFTR, including the most frequent Δ508 deletion, prevent biosynthetic maturation (Gregory et al., 15Gregory R.J. Rich D.P. Cheng S.H. Souza D.W. Paul S. Manavalan P. Anderson M.P. Welsh M.I. Smith A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3886-3893Google Scholar). We find that this is also true of several mutations in CL4, in that 12 of the 18 resulted in misprocessing of the protein and its retention in the ER. Thus, for patients that carry these mutations, the CF phenotype most likely is a result of lack of channel expression at the cell surface. In the case of previously studied CFTR mutations known to result in ER retention, including ΔF508, it is believed that local misfolding prevents the attainment of the global cytoplasmic conformation of CFTR that is required for maturation and ER to Golgi transport. CL4 would be expected to contribute to this overall tertiary structure of the cytoplasmic aspect of the molecule on the ER surface. Disturbance of the local secondary structure of CL4 due to point mutations may prevent it from adequately making this contribution. It is not obvious why amino acid substitutions at 9 of the 14 different positions may compromise secondary structure, whereas those at the remaining 5 positions appear not to (see Table I). However, all of the substitutions resulting in misprocessing involve either charge changes or the introduction of a proline. Alterations at all of the positions in the C-terminal half of CL4 result in misprocessing, but only half of those in the N-terminal portion do so. Mutations at adjacent residues in that portion may either prevent maturation or not, viz. 1060 and 1061; 1066 and 1067; 1070 and 1071. Different substitutions at the same residue always produced the same effect, i.e. R1066C, R1066H, and R1066L, as well as M1101K and M1101R all inhibited maturation, whereas R1070W and R1070Q were both normally processed. The impacts of the mutations on CFTR maturation are compared with the reported pancreatic status of the patients in which they were detected in Table I. For 8 of 11 mutations resulting in misprocessing and failure of maturation, the patients were pancreatic-insufficient and for two of three mutations allowing processing the patients were pancreatic-sufficient. This is consistent with the possibility that biosynthetic arrest of CFTR in the ER may cause severe disease, whereas some point mutations, compatible with transport of the protein to the cell surface, may result in less severe disease.Table I.Pancreatic status of patients containing CL4 mutationsMutationBiosynthetic processingPancreatic statusRef.F1052V+—aNot reported.

Open table in a new tab Those amino acid substitutions that do not interfere with maturation have relatively minor effects on channel activity. Bulk measurements of cyclic AMP-stimulated iodide efflux from entire populations of cells expressing these variants showed that they did not differ drastically from wild type. Patch-clamp analysis demonstrated that the CFTR channel in all six processed mutants had similar current-voltage relationships and conductances as the wild-type channel, indicating that once the channel was open, chloride permeation was not altered. This suggests that despite their close proximity to the putative pore entrance, these residues do not contribute to interactions between the channel and the permeant anion. However, all of these mutant channels had decreased open probability. Their residual partial activity correlates well with a less severe phenotype in that two out of three of the fully processed were found in pancreatic-sufficient patients. The significance of the altered open probabilities is highlighted by the fact that each of the single amino acid substitutions in CL4 reduced the open probability of the channel, whereas deletion of 19 residues in CL2 had no effect on the open probability (Xie et al., 36Xie J. Drumm M.L. Ma J. Davis P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28084-28091Google Scholar). Generally, the decreased open probability of the CL4 mutants resulted from both a decrease in channel open time and an increase in closed time. An understanding of how residues Phe1052, Lys1060, Ala1067, Gly1069, and Arg1070 in the N-terminal half of CL4 affect channel opening and closing must await more information about the structure of the molecule. However, it seems reasonable to postulate that this segment may interact with one or more of the large regulatory cytoplasmic domains, possibly providing a link between these domains and the pore-forming parts of CFTR.Comparison of CFTR sequences among species shows that 13 of the 14 residues investigated in this study are 100% conserved (Diamond et al., 9Diamond G. Scanlin T.F. Zasloff M.A. Bevins C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22761-22769Google Scholar), consistent with the hypothesis that these amino acids are important to the proper folding and function of CFTR. Only Gly1069 is replaced by different residues in other species. Interestingly in murine CFTR, Gly1069 is replaced by Arg, a human mutation that we found to leave biosynthetic processing unaffected but to reduce channel open probability. Alignment of CFTR with a number of other traffic ATPases (Manavalan et al., 23Manavalan P. Smith A.E. McPherson J.M. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 279-290Google Scholar) indicates that Arg1066 is the most conserved of the 14 residues studied in CL4. All three of the mutations reported at this position result in failure of maturation. The conservation of this residue may thus be a result of its importance for the proper biosynthetic processing of these proteins.In summary, it was found that 12 of the mutations identified in CL4 result in the CF phenotype due to misprocessing of CFTR, thus showing that point mutations in CL4 can perturb the overall structure of the molecule sufficiently to mark it for retention in the ER. Six mutations allowed the protein to mature, and in these, the CF phenotype is likely a consequence of the decreased channel open probability detected. The decrease in open probability could generally be attributed to an increase in the channel mean closed time and a decrease in the mean open time. This result together with the unaltered conductance suggests that mutations in CL4 do not affect pore properties of CFTR, but rather the mechanism of channel gating. Finally, these data provide the first functional evidence that this set of mutations probably does cause disease.

Three new residues in the carboxyl half of the Na,K-ATPase, Phe-786, Leu-793 (PFLIF786IIANIPL793PLGT797), and Phe-863 (FTYF863VIM) have been identified as ouabain sensitivity determinants using random mutagenesis. Polymerase chain reaction was utilized to randomly mutate the DNA sequence encoding the amino acids between Lys-691 and Lys-945 in the α subunit of the Na,K-ATPase. This region contains four transmembrane segments (H5, H6, H7, and H8) and the connecting extracellular and cytoplasmic loops. Diverse substitutions of these three residues resulted in proteins displaying 2.8-48-fold increases in the I50 of different cardiac glycosides for inhibition of the Na,K-ATPase activity. By locating these residues, in conjunction with Thr-797 (Feng, J., and Lingrel, J.

Thus, a link between the cardiac glycoside binding site and the cation transport sites of the Na,K-ATPase transpires giving a structural base to the cation antagonism of ouabain binding.

The Na,K-ATPase is the pharmacological target for the cardiac glycoside class of drugs, such as digitoxin, which is used in the treatment of congestive heart failure and certain arrhythmias (5Hansen O. Pharmacol. Rev. 1984; 36: 143-163Google Scholar, 6Thomas R. Gray P. Andrews J. Adv. Drug Res. 1990; 19: 311-562Google Scholar). Defining the residues involved in the binding of these drugs will aid in our understanding of their inhibition mechanism. Approaches to identify regions of the enzyme that interact with the cardiac glycosides have included both affinity labeling and molecular biology techniques. For example, binding of these drugs to the extracellular surface of the α subunit of the Na,K-ATPase was shown by probing the enzyme with photoactivable cardiac glycoside analogues (7Forbush III, B. Kaplan J. Hoffman J.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 3667-3676Google Scholar, 8Rossi B. Vuilleumier P. Gache C. Balerna M. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9936-9941Google Scholar). Chemical modification studies also showed that these drugs interact with both the N-terminal and C-terminal half of the protein (9Antolovic R. Schoner W. Geering K. Canesa C. Rossier B.C.

Site-directed mutagenesis has been useful in identifying specific amino acid residues that are involved in cardiac glycoside binding (9Antolovic R. Schoner W. Geering K. Canesa C. Rossier B.C.

In these mutagenesis studies, specific amino acid substitutions were introduced into a ouabain-sensitive α isoform by site-directed mutagenesis, and the altered cDNAs were transfected into cells carrying an endogenous ouabain-sensitive α1 isoform. Amino acid substitutions that prevent inhibition by ouabain conferred ouabain resistance to the sensitive cells (11Price E.M. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Google Scholar, 12Price E.M.

Cantley L. Levenson R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7726-7733Google Scholar). Since ouabain interacts with the extracellular portion of the Na,K-ATPase, initial studies concentrated on substituting amino acids in the extracellular loops of the enzyme (Fig. 1). Species-specific differences between the ouabain-sensitive sheep α1 and ouabain-resistant rat α1 subunits were observed in the first extracellular loop of the protein. When the border residues of this loop were substituted in the sheep α1 subunit, Gln-111 and Asn-122, with those amino acids naturally appearing in the ouabain-resistant rat α1 subunit, Arg and Asp, respectively, a subunit with ouabain-resistant binding properties equal to that of the rat α1 subunit was produced (11Price E.M. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8400-8408Google Scholar). Additional studies identified substitutions at Asp-121 of the first extracellular loop (12Price E.M. Rice D.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21902-21906Google Scholar, 13Price E.M. Rice D.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6638-6641Google Scholar) as well as Cys-104 and Tyr-108 of the first transmembrane region as conferring resistance to ouabain (15Canesa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Louvard D. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1681-1687Google Scholar, 16Schultheis P.J. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 544-550Google Scholar). In agreement with these results, when the N-terminal portion of the Ca-ATPase was replaced with the corresponding region of the chicken Na,K-ATPase, the resulting chimeric protein exhibited Ca-ATPase activity that was sensitive to ouabain (22Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8881-8885Google Scholar). However, a chimera carrying the N-terminal half of the ouabain-insensitive rat gastric H,K-ATPase and the C-terminal portion of the rat α1 subunit was also inhibited by ouabain implicating the C-terminal portion of the Na,K-ATPase in ouabain binding (23Blostein R. Zhang R. Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10654-10658Google Scholar). This finding was supported by the identification of Thr-797 (18Burns E.L. Price E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25632-25635Google Scholar, 19Feng J. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4218-4224Google Scholar) and Arg-880 (17Schultheis P.J. Wallick E.T. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22686-22694Google Scholar) as required for ouabain binding. The complex nature of the protein-drug interaction is also suggested by binding kinetics that indicate that the interaction of the glycoside with the Na,K-ATPase is dependent on the conformation of the protein (25Yoda A. Yoda S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1975; 11: 653-662Google Scholar, 26Wallick E.T. Schwartz A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 156: 201-213Google Scholar, 27Akera T. Brody T.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 1978; 29: 311-562Google Scholar). For example, when the enzyme is phosphorylated in the catalytic cycle (E2P) it binds ouabain with high affinity (KD≈1 × 10−9M). However, when Na+ or K+ binds to the ATPase (E1(Na) or E2(K)), the conformation of the enzyme changes such that its affinity for ouabain is greatly reduced. From these binding characteristics, it can be deduced that the residues that coordinate the cardiac glycoside must be spatially rearranged upon conformational changes during the catalytic cycle (i.e. hidden, exposed, or moved with respect to one another and the drug). Thus, in spite of considerable studies, the three-dimensional organization of the cardiac glycoside binding site and the structural basis for the inhibition mechanism remain unknown. Several reports from our laboratory and others (28Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13523-13530Google Scholar, 29Argüello J.M. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Google Scholar) have recently identified the hairpin loop comprised of the fifth and sixth transmembrane helices as critical for cation binding and energy transduction. This region contains four residues, Ser-775, Glu-779, Asp-804, and Asp-808, most likely involved in cation coordination and transport (28Jewell-Motz E.A. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13523-13530Google Scholar, 30Argüello J.M. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6892-6899Google Scholar, 31Vilsen B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Google Scholar). Furthermore, different experimental approaches suggest that this domain may move during the catalytic cycle following phosphorylation (29Argüello J.M. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14627-14635Google Scholar, 33Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4555-4564Google Scholar, 34Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Google Scholar). Consequently, the interaction of ouabain with the H5-H6 segment would be critical in terms of the binding and inhibition mechanisms. One residue in this hairpin, Thr-797, was already shown to be involved in ouabain sensitivity (18Burns E.L. Price E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25632-25635Google Scholar, 19Feng J. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4218-4224Google Scholar). Due to the importance of this domain in enzyme function, we have targeted this region in search of other residues that might be important for cardiac glycoside inhibition. While most of the substitutions that affect ouabain sensitivity have been identified using site-directed mutagenesis, Thr-797 (18Burns E.L. Price E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25632-25635Google Scholar) and Arg-880 (17Schultheis P.J. Wallick E.T. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22686-22694Google Scholar) were produced by chemically treating the DNA to randomly introduce mutations (36Myers R.M. Lerman L.S. Maniatis T. Science. 1985; 224: 242-247Google Scholar). This type of mutagenesis alters particular codons more frequently than others due to the higher reactivity of certain bases with the mutating reagent. Recently, a new approach utilizing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionI50concentration of cardiac glycoside which produces 50% of inhibitionDEAC4-(diazomethyl)-7-(diethylamine) coumarinbpbase pair. has been developed which in principle allows unbiased, saturating mutagenesis of large DNA cassettes (37Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods and Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Google Scholar). The work reported here utilizes this PCR-random mutagenesis approach to thoroughly examine the region of the Na,K-ATPase between transmembrane segments H5 and H8, including both cytoplasmic and extracellular amino acids (4Jørgensen P.L. De Pont J.J. Molecular Aspects of Transport Proteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1992: 1Google Scholar). Three new residues have been identified as determinants of cardiac glycoside inhibition, Leu-793, Phe-786, and Phe-863. Two of these amino acids in conjunction with Thr-797 are located in the H5-H6 hairpin loop suggesting a major role for this domain in cardiac glycoside binding and inhibition. polymerase chain reaction concentration of cardiac glycoside which produces 50% of inhibition 4-(diazomethyl)-7-(diethylamine) coumarin base pair. A 429-base pair SalI-XbaI fragment encoding amino acid residues 87–229 and a 763-base pair HindIII-BglII fragment encoding amino acid residues 691–945 of the sheep α1 subunit were randomly mutated using the PCR conditions described by Cadwell and Joyce (37Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. PCR Methods and Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Google Scholar). The mutagenized cassettes were isolated and subcloned into the corresponding fragment in the wild type sheep α1 cDNA in a pKC4 expression vector (8Rossi B. Vuilleumier P. Gache C. Balerna M. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9936-9941Google Scholar). The constructs were transformed into DH5αf bacterial cells and grown in the presence of ampicillin. The mutant population size was calculated from the number of ampicillin-resistant colonies surviving on an LB-Amp plate. Several colonies were picked at random from the plates, and the plasmid DNA was isolated for sequencing. The mutated cassette was sequenced to determine the number of mutations introduced. The mutation rate was calculated as the percentage of mutated bases in the sequenced fragments. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. The pooled mutant plasmids were linearized with ScaI and electroporated into wild type HeLa cells. The electroporation was performed in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 0.1 mM dithiothreitol and 10 mM dextrose at 300 V and 960 microfarads. 5 × 106 cells/ml and 12.5 µg of DNA/ml were suspended in electroporation media and preincubated at 0°C for 5 min. After electroporation, the cells were transferred to tissue culture dishes. 24 h after transfection, cells were selected by the addition of 0.2 µM ouabain in the growth media during a period of 2–3 weeks. The transfection efficiency was calculated to be 25 colonies/µg transfected DNA. Ouabain-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded into stable lines. Whole cell Western blots were performed to analyze the proteins from the ouabain-resistant cells (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press Plainview, NY1989: 18.60Google Scholar). The antibody M8-P1-A3 that does not recognize the endogenous human α1 isoform of the HeLa cells was used as the specific sheep α1 probe (39Malik B. Jamieson G.A. Ball Jr., W. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2103-2111Google Scholar). DNA isolated from the clonal cell lines was amplified and sequenced using procedures previously described (20Askew G.R. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24120-24126Google Scholar). The 763-bp HindIII-BglII cassette (see above) was subcloned into the M13mp19 vector, and specific single mutations were introduced by the method of Kunkel (40Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Google Scholar). Mutated cassettes were sequenced and then ligated back into the wild type sheep α1 cDNA in the pKC4 expression vector. The pKC4 vectors were linearized with ScaI and electroporated into HeLa cells. Crude membranes from control and transfected HeLa cells were isolated using a NaI treatment (41Lane L.K. Copenhaver Jr., J.H. Lindenmayer G.E. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7197-7200Google Scholar) as described previously by Jewell and Lingrel (42Jewell E.A. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16925-16930Google Scholar). The protein concentration of each preparation was determined by the method of Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase activity in crude membrane preparation was quantitated as described previously (35Argüello J.M. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22764-22771Google Scholar) using the following assay medium: 0.5 mM EGTA, 130 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 3 mM ATP, and 50 mM imidazole, pH 7.2 (20°C), 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1–2 µg/ml membrane protein and varying concentrations of cardiac glycoside. The cardiac glycosides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide in order to increase solubility. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide in the ATPase assay media was 1%. The assay was performed at 37°C for 30 min and the released inorganic phosphate determined by the colorimetric method of Lanzetta et al. (44Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 5-97Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase activities at each inhibitor concentration were expressed as percentages of the total Na,K-ATPase activity, which was estimated as the difference in activity in presence of 0 and 10 mM ouabain. The total Na,K-ATPase activity in membrane preparations from the different substituted enzymes was between 10–15 µmol of Pi/mg/h. The ATPase data were fit to a four-parameter logistic function for inhibition: V = {(Vmax− Vmin)/(1 + (X/I50)n) + Vmin} where Vmin and n were fixed at 0 and 1, respectively, representing the minimum activity and the Hill coefficient. Vmax is the maximum activity in the absence of inhibitor and X is the concentration of inhibitor. The I50 value is the concentration of ligand which produces 50% of the inhibition. Random mutagenesis coupled with a ouabain selection system provides a powerful method for identifying residues that are involved in ouabain binding to the Na,K-ATPase. The random mutagenesis procedure used in this work is PCR-based which under appropriate conditions misincorporates nucleotides into amplified DNA in an unbiased manner. In principle, every nucleotide can be replaced by the other three, resulting in at least four amino acid substitutions at each site in the primary sequence. However, due to the redundancy in the amino acid codons, it is not possible to convert each residue to every other amino acid. By using this approach, a pool of mutant cDNAs is introduced into cells, and the ouabain selection system screens for the mutants of interest. If an α subunit cDNA encoding a substitution in a residue critical for ouabain binding is expressed in sensitive HeLa cells, resistance to ouabain is conferred. Untransfected cells are not able to survive in the presence of 0.2 µM ouabain in the growth media since this level of drug inhibits the endogenous Na,K-ATPase activity. The objective of random mutagenesis is to introduce saturating levels of substitutions into the cDNA, such that all residues are replaced by several if not all other amino acids. An indication that a specific fragment has been saturated can be deduced from the appearance of positive controls (i.e. substitutions that have been determined in the past to influence ouabain binding to the enzyme). The cassette of interest encodes amino acids 691–945 which includes two residues previously implicated in ouabain binding (Arg-880 and Thr-797). We also randomly mutated the DNA cassette which codes for amino acids 87–229, which contains six residues known to be involved in ouabain binding as additional positive controls (Fig. 1). As expected some of these residues were found in our PCR mutagenesis study (Table I). Statistical calculations can also provide a good indication of the number of mutant plasmids that would represent more than 99% of all the possible single base substitutions (45Feller W. An Introduction to Probability Theory and Its Application. 3rd Ed. Wiley Publishing Co., New York1970Google Scholar); however, these calculations do not account for redundancy in the DNA code. Using a trinomial distribution, the number of DNAs required for saturation was estimated to be 55,000 for the 430-bp fragment encoding amino acid residues 86–229 and 80,000 for the 763-bp fragment encoding amino acid residues 691–945. The mutant plasmid pool for each of the cassettes used in this study is shown in Table I. This value demonstrates that saturation was likely achieved for the region of interest, namely Lys-691 to Lys-945. Another important parameter indicating the efficiency of this PCR mutagenesis approach is the average mutation rate. This is the number of single base substitutions found in 100 bp of mutagenized DNA. This value indicated that more than one base was substituted for each cassette mutated. Therefore, after the substitutions in the cassette were identified, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to isolate the amino acid replacement that conveyed the ouabain-resistant phenotype.Table I.Results of random mutagenesisMutagenized cassetteNumber of mutant plasmids transfectedMutation rateSubstitutions found in resistant coloniesaUnderlined substitutions have previously been found to be resistant; substitutions in bold are new mutants found in this work.%Arg-87 to Pro-22916,0000.4Clone 1, I199LH1-H2Clone 2, Clone 3, V184VLys-691 to Lys-94580,4000.3Clone 4, 1742L, L793PClone 5, T781A, T807AH5-H8Clone 6, I769L, F786I, G858S, F863La Underlined substitutions have previously been found to be resistant; substitutions in bold are new mutants found in this work. Open table in a new tab Pools of mutated DNA were transfected into HeLa, and the ouabain-resistant clones were isolated. Six of these clones are listed in Table I. Immunoblot analysis of total protein isolated from ouabain-resistant clones verified that the transfected sheep α1 cDNA was expressed (data not shown). The DNA from clones 1–6 was amplified by PCR and sequenced across the entire mutated cassette to determine the base changes responsible for the phenotype. Table I shows that each mutant clone contained more than one amino acid change, either a new amino acid substitution, a known substitution, or a silent mutation. Some mutations were identified in conjunction with substitutions previously shown to affect ouabain binding (Table I, clones 1, 3, and 5). Since the mutation in the codon for Val-184 was silent and both Thr-781 → Ala and Thr-807 → Ala were previously shown not to affect ouabain sensitivity (19Feng J. Lingrel J.B Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4218-4224Google Scholar), the ouabain-resistant phenotype of clones 3 and 5 was obviously due to substitutions in residues previously identified. Due to the location of Ile-199 in the first cytoplasmic loop, the phenotype of clone 1 was thought to be due to the Asn-122 → Asp substitution. For those clones containing only new amino acid changes (clones 4 and 6), each amino acid substitution was made independently by site-directed mutagenesis to identify the mutation that was responsible for the phenotype. Three new individual amino acid substitutions were shown to confer ouabain resistance, Leu-793 → Pro, Phe-863 → Ile, and Phe-863 → Leu (Table I). No ouabain-resistant colonies were observed in cells transfected with substitutions Ile-742 → Leu, Ile-769 → Leu, or Gly-858 → Leu. To explore the structure/function role of the side chains at position 793, 863, and 786, site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert these residues to others which vary in their chemical nature (Table II). In the case of Leu-793, the conservative substitution, Leu-793 → Ile, and the radical change, Leu-793→ Glu, did not result in ouabain-resistant cells. The nonconservative amino acid changes of Phe-786 and Phe-863 to asparagine resulted in ouabain-resistant cells for the former but not the latter. On the other hand, the replacement of the aromatic side chains at position 786 and 863 with hydrophobic, linear side chains conferred ouabain resistance to cells. As expected, the substitutions that produced ouabain-resistant colonies reduced the affinity of the enzyme for the drug, as indicated by ouabain I50 values (Table II). Leu-793 → Pro was found to be the most highly resistant of the three original substitutions (24-fold) when compared with the human isoform encoded by the wild type HeLa cells.Table II.Ouabain inhibition of substituted enzymes constructed by site-directed mutagenesisAmino acid substituionaSheep α1 mutants were constructed as described under “Materials and Methods.”I50× 106 MFold resistanceWild type HeLa0.751 ×L793P1824 ×L793INRbOuabain-resistant colonies were not detected.L793N2.12.8 ×L793ENRbOuabain-resistant colonies were not detected.L793K6.68.8 ×F786I8.411 ×F786N1419 ×F863L4.35.7 ×F863NNRbOuabain-resistant colonies were not detected.a Sheep α1 mutants were constructed as described under “Materials and Methods.”b Ouabain-resistant colonies were not detected. Open table in a new tab Naturally occurring cardiac glycosides share the common basic structure shown in Fig. 2. They are characterized by a steroid ring system (5β,14β-androstane-3β,14-diol) which is the “lead” structure in cardiac glycosides (48Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1693-1703Google Scholar). Both the lactone ring at position C17 and the sugar moiety at C3 increase the specificity and stability of the drug-enzyme complex (6Thomas R. Gray P. Andrews J. Adv. Drug Res. 1990; 19: 311-562Google Scholar). Although cardiac glycosides share the same basic structural features, it is predicted that the Na,K-ATPase contains different binding pockets that interact with specific moieties of the cardiac glycosides in a complex manner (6Thomas R. Gray P. Andrews J. Adv. Drug Res. 1990; 19: 311-562Google Scholar), as demonstrated by Askew and Lingrel (20Askew G.R. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24120-24126Google Scholar). To test for putative interactions between the newly identified residues and a specific moiety of the cardiac glycoside, inactivation of the mutant enzyme activities by a series of cardiac glycosides was analyzed. The results of these studies are shown in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table III, Table IV. All the substitutions increased the I50 values of each drug tested (Table III). For example, the substitution Phe-863 → Leu increases the I50 values of all the drugs 4–8-fold compared with wild type. On the contrary, substitutions of Leu-793 affect the I50 values for each of the cardiac glycosides to a different degree (2–48-fold). The largest change in I50 values was observed with the Leu-793 substitutions and the inhibition by ouabagenin (28–48-fold increase). Fig. 3, A and B, shows the differential effects of the substitutions at Leu-793, compared with those at Phe-786 and Phe-863, on the inhibition patterns of ouabain and ouabagenin. The large ouabagenin I50 values observed for the Leu-793 substitutions increase the ouabagenin/ouabain ratios suggesting that the sugar moiety of ouabain stabilizes the mutant-drug interactions. However, this trend was not observed between digitoxigenin and digitoxin which also vary only in the sugar moiety. Unlike Leu-793, the substitutions in Phe-786 decrease the ratios of the I50 values for the paired drugs indicating that the sugar moiety is less important for cardiac glycoside binding to these mutants.Table IIII50 values for various cardiac glycosides (I50× 106 M)MutantOuabainOuabageni"

https://openalex.org/W2001206569,"We have cloned from a Xenopus ovary cDNA library a novel protein kinase gene whose expression peaks in the oocyte and unfertilized egg, begins to decrease gradually after fertilization, and disappears during the gastrulation stage of embryogenesis. The cloned gene, termed XEEK1 (for enopus gg and mbryo inase), encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 49 kDa. Bacterially expressed XEEK1 migrates at 57 kDa upon polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, and a XEEK1-specific antibody recognizes a protein of 57 kDa in Xenopus oocyte and egg extracts. The XEEK1 kinase domain shares 35% identity (∼65% similarity) with the yeast SNF1 kinase and related kinases. However, expression of XEEK1 does not complement a snf1 deletion mutation in yeast, which suggests that it is probably not a Xenopus homolog of SNF1. Recombinant XEEK1 protein autophosphorylates on threonine residues in vitro in a reaction that prefers Mn2+ to Mg2+ ions. Site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved lysine residue (Lys-81) within the kinase domain to isoleucine totally abolishes kinase activity, and threonine 192 has been identified as the autophosphorylation site. This site is distinct from the conserved threonine (Thr-215 in XEEK1) present in the protein kinase activation loop that is the site of autophosphorylation for many protein kinases. XEEK1 is a substrate for the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a possible mode of regulation of XEEK1. An immunoprecipitate of oocyte/egg extracts with anti-XEEK1 serum contains a protein of ∼155 kDa that may be a substrate and/or a regulatory component of the kinase.

One of the main mechanisms that govern cell cycle progression in eukaryotic cells is the sequential activation and deactivation of Cdc2 kinase. Several lines of evidence have shown that the Wee1 protein kinase and its related kinases, Mik1 and Myt1, negatively regulate Cdc2 kinase activity by phosphorylating a conserved tyrosine residue in the Cdc2 kinase (Russell and Nurse, 32Russell P.

This negative regulation is believed to be a major control mechanism that prevents the onset of mitosis until the completion of DNA synthesis (Enoch and Nurse, 11Enoch T. Nurse P. Cell. 1991; 65: 921-923Google Scholar). Because of the central importance of Wee1-related kinases in cell cycle control, we undertook a polymerase chain reaction strategy to identify and characterize such kinases in Xenopus, where the availability of cycling egg extracts provides a system for functional analysis of cell cycle biochemistry. We report here the analysis of one protein kinase, XEEK1, identified in this manner, that is likely to play a role in early embryonic development.

BamHI and SalI restriction sites, underlined in the primer sequences, were generated at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the PCR products, respectively. Total Xenopus ovary cDNA was prepared as described previously (Su and Maller, 40Su J.Y. Maller J.L. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 387-396Google Scholar), except that synthesized cDNA was used directly as template for PCRs. For the first PCR, 10 ng of cDNA, 50 pmol each of primers VIb-5′ and IX-3′, dNTPs, and Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in a final volume of 100 µl were subjected to five cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 37°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 52°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. Products from the first PCR were purified by a QIAquick-spin PCR purification kit (QIAGEN Inc.) and used as template for the second PCR. The second PCR, containing 1 µl of the first PCR products, 50 pmol each of primers VII-5′ and VIII-3′, dNTPs, and Taq polymerase, was subjected to 40 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 52°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min. Amplified fragments of ∼100-300 bp were purified from a 2% agarose gel and cloned into the pCR-Script SK(+) vector (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's suggestions. Cloned DNA was recovered and subjected to DNA sequencing analysis on both DNA strands by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method with the Sequenase version 2 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The DNA sequence data were analyzed with a MacVector 3.5 program (IBI) on a Macintosh Quadra 800 and through the NCBI BLAST E-mail Server. From initial screening of 10 clones, six protein kinase-related sequences were obtained. Among them, five clones belonged to the known protein kinase families of XMEK2, PKC, and CDK2 in Xenopus. However, one novel protein kinase sequence, designated XEEK1, was also identified and chosen for further study. We adopted, with slight modification, a recently developed protocol to isolate the full-length cDNA clone of this protein kinase from Xenopus (Pippin et al., 31Pippin J. Contractor V. Ambrus Jr., J.L. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 676-680Google Scholar). A DNA fragment (∼150 bp) containing the novel kinase sequence was excised from the pCR-Script plasmid and purified. Ten micrograms of this purified DNA fragment was dissolved in 20 µl of H2O, and 2 µl was spotted onto each of 10 1-cm2 nylon membranes (Boehringer Mannheim). After the membranes were dried, they were placed on 0.5 M NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl-saturated Whatman No. 3MM filter paper for 30 min; transferred to dry filter paper; and UV-cross-linked with a Stratalinker UV cross-linker (Stratagene). DNA-bound membranes were neutralized in 10 ml of 1 M Tris-HCl, 1.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0, for 5 min and rinsed in 10 ml of 5 × SSC (Sambrook et al., 34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) for another 5 min. Prehybridization was then performed with 10 ml of 1 × prehybridization solution from a µWAVE screening kit (Invitrogen) at 65°C for 1 h. A microcentrifuge tube containing 200 µg of plasmid DNA from a Xenopus ovary cDNA library (Su and Maller, 40Su J.Y. Maller J.L. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 387-396Google Scholar) was prepared as follows. DNA was denatured by the addition of NaOH to a final concentration of 0.2 N and incubation at room temperature for 5 min. Next, 0.1 volume of 3 M sodium acetate, pH 4.8, was added along with 2 volumes of 100% ethanol to precipitate the DNA. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, the cDNA was resuspended in 100 µl of H2O and placed in a 15-ml tube. Five milliliters of 1 × hybridization solution (µWAVE screening kit) that had been prewarmed to 65°C was added immediately, and the solution was boiled for 2 min. The DNA-bound membranes were removed from the prehybridization solution, added to the tube, and incubated at 65°C overnight. The membranes were washed for 5 min twice with 50 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% SDS, pH 7.6, and once with 50 ml of 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.6. Each individual membrane was then placed in a microcentrifuge tube containing 300 µl of H2O and 30 µg of yeast tRNA. DNA was eluted from the membranes by incubation at 95°C for 2 min, mixed briefly by vortexing, and then snap-frozen in dry ice. The samples were allowed to thaw slowly on ice and mixed. DNA eluted from the membranes was recovered by alcohol precipitation, resuspended in 50 µl of H2O, and used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α ElectroMAX competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.). A few hundred bacterial colonies were obtained on the selective plates. The original DNA fragment (∼150 bp) containing the novel kinase sequence was radiolabeled and used as a probe to screen these colonies with the µWAVE screening kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Several positive colonies were recovered and used to prepare plasmid DNA for further analysis. GST-XEEK1 was constructed by subcloning fragments amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5′-GCC ATG CTG TGT CCT TCC AGT ATG-3′ (a 5′-primer introducing a BglII site upstream of the ATG initiation codon) and 5′-GCC TCA CTG TTG TTT GCA GGC AGA-3′ (a 3′-primer introducing an EcoRI site downstream of the TGA termination codon). The 1299-bp BglII-EcoRI fragment containing the entire XEEK1 coding region was subcloned into the plasmid pGEX-2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at BamHI and EcoRI sites to form pGEX2-XEEK1. The site-directed mutagenesis of pGEX2-XEEK1 was performed by a PCR method essentially as described previously (Landt et al., 22Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Google Scholar), except that Taq polymerase was replaced by Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) in the PCRs with the following oligonucleotides: K81I, 5′-TTT TTT CAG GAT TT GAC AGC ACG GCG-3′; T192A, 5′-AGA TTT TGA GTG CC CGT CTG TTG T-3′; T212A, 5′-TGG TCC TAC AAG AT CAC CTT CAG C-3′; and T215A, 5′-AGA TCC CTG GCT GG CCT ACA AGT ATC-3′. The lower-case letters underlined in the primer sequences indicate the introduced mutation sites, and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild-type or mutant clones of pGEX2-XEEK1 were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) for recombinant protein expression. Expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 50 µM and incubation at ambient temperature for 4–5 h. The bacteria were lysed, and the GST-tagged proteins were adsorbed onto glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) as described elsewhere (Crews et al., 9Crews C.M. Alessandrini A.A. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8845-8849Google Scholar). The proteins were eluted with 10 mM glutathione, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol; dialyzed against 25 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.05% Brij-35, 50% ethylene glycol; and stored at −20°C. The concentration was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Laemmli, 21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), Coomassie Blue staining, and densitometry on a Molecular Dynamics computing densitometer using bovine serum albumin as a standard (A280 of a 1% solution = 6.5). The 1299-bp BglII-EcoRI DNA fragment containing the entire XEEK1 coding region was subcloned into a yeast expression vector, pMC944 (provided by Dr. M. Castañón, Ernst Boehringer Institute, Vienna), to form pMC944-XEEK1, in which expression is driven by a yeast mating factor promoter (MFα1) (Spevak et al., 36Spevak W. Keiper B.D. Stratowa C. Castañón M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4953-4966Google Scholar). pMC944-XEEK1 was then transformed into yeast strain MCY2916 carrying a snf1Δ mutation (MATα snf1Δ his3 ura3 lys2 leu2; obtained from Dr. M. Carlson, Columbia University, New York). The expression of XEEK1 in yeast was verified by immunoblotting with anti-XEEK1 serum. Yeast SNF1 function is required for expression of various glucose-repressible genes in response to glucose deprivation; snf1 mutants are unable to utilize sucrose, galactose, maltose, or nonfermentable carbon sources (Carlson et al., 7Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1981; 98: 25-40Google Scholar). Thus, yeast transformants were tested for complementation of snf1 by screening their ability to grow in medium containing sucrose or glycerol as the sole carbon source. Unfertilized eggs were obtained from female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus I, Ann Arbor, MI), primed with 75 units of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin 5 days prior to the experiment, and induced to ovulate by the injection of 550 units of human chorionic gonadotropin 14–16 h prior to the experiment. Metaphase II-arrested, cytostatic factor extracts were prepared from unfertilized eggs as described (Murray, 28Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Google Scholar). For oocyte extracts, stage VI oocytes were manually dissected from their follicular envelopes, homogenized in 2 volumes of extraction buffer (80 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 15 mM MgCl2, 20 mM EGTA, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 30 mM p-nitrophenol phosphate, 10 µg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin), and centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. The supernatants were used for analysis. For embryos, eggs were fertilized in vitro; dejellied in 2% cysteine, pH 7.8; washed in 0.1 × MMR buffer (10 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM KCl, 0.1 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM CaCl2, and 0.5 mM Hepes, pH 7.8); and cultured at room temperature in 0.1 × MMR buffer. The embryos were staged according to 29Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1975Google Scholar. Embryos were collected at the indicated stages, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80°C until further analysis. The embryos were homogenized in 10 volumes of extraction buffer and centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatants were used for immunoblotting. Total RNA was isolated from staged embryos by homogenizing frozen samples in guanidinium isothiocyanate; extracting with acidic phenol, chloroform, and isoamyl alcohol; and precipitating in isopropyl alcohol (Sambrook et al., 34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA (10 µg/lane) was fractionated by electrophoresis through a horizontal 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted under standard conditions. To determine the migration of the molecular mass markers, the portion of the gel with the RNA molecular mass markers (Life Technologies, Inc.) was stained with ethidium bromide (1 µg/ml) and illuminated by shortwave UV light. The DNA probe was the 1299-bp BglII-EcoRI XEEK1 DNA fragment radiolabeled using a random hexamer kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Hybridization and wash conditions were as described (Sambrook et al., 34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The blot was then stripped of the XEEK1 probe and reprobed with c-src to control for RNA loading since c-src expression is constant in Xenopus embryos (Steele et al., 37Steele R.E. Unger T.F. Mardis M.J. Fero J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10649-10653Google Scholar). This probe was the 1300-bp EcoRI fragment of Xenopus src-1 excised from a cDNA clone kindly provided by Dr. R. Steele (University of California, Irvine, CA). Antiserum was raised in rabbits against purified recombinant XEEK1 protein expressed in bacteria. The antibody was affinity-purified on nitrocellulose blots of full-length recombinant XEEK1 as described (Olmsted, 30Olmsted J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11955-11957Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of XEEK1 was performed essentially as described (Harlow and Lane, 17Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Briefly, oocyte/egg extract (5–10 µl) was diluted in extraction buffer to a final volume of 150 µl, precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma), incubated with 2.5 µl of affinity-purified antibody for 2 h on ice, mixed with 25 µl of 50% protein A-Sepharose for 1 h, washed with 0.5 ml of high and low salt buffers (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and either 1 M or 100 mM NaCl, respectively), and finally washed with buffer without any divalent cation (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1% Brij-35). Precipitates were resuspended in the same buffer and subjected to phosphorylation analysis. For the experiments analyzing the phosphorylation of XEEK1 in vivo, immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described previously with a slight modification (Erikson and Maller, 12Erikson E. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13711-13717Google Scholar). Briefly, [γ-32P]ATP (20 mCi/ml) was added to oocyte extract in the presence or absence of PKI and incubated at ambient temperature for 10 min. The reaction was then diluted in 3 volumes of buffer containing 55 mMβ-glycerophosphate, pH 6.8, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaF, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 100 µM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 µg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin. After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, 0.125 volume of 5 × concentrated electrophoresis sample buffer was added to the supernatant, and the samples were boiled for 3 min. The samples were centrifuged again at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were diluted and processed as described (Erikson and Maller, 12Erikson E. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13711-13717Google Scholar). A sample of recombinant XEEK1 protein or immunoprecipitate was incubated at 30°C for 15 min in 30 µl of 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2 or MnCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 µM [γ-32P]ATP (150 cpm/fmol). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.25 volume of 5 × concentrated sample buffer and incubation at 95°C for 2 min. Products of the reaction were resolved by PAGE and visualized by staining and autoradiography. Phosphorylation reactions with PKA were done as described above, except that the reaction buffer comprised 25 mM MES, pH 6.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 3.75 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 µg/ml bovine serum albumin, and the concentration of [γ-32P]ATP (1–5 cpm/fmol) was 100 µM. The products of the reaction were diluted with an equal volume of 50 mM CaCl2, digested with thrombin (16 µg/ml) for 1 h at ambient temperature, and analyzed as described above. For phosphoamino acid analysis, radiolabeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.), visualized by autoradiography, and excised. The samples were hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl at 100°C for 1 h and lyophilized twice, and phosphoamino acids were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis as described (Kamps and Sefton, 19Kamps P.K. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Google Scholar). For phosphopeptide mapping, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and digested with trypsin as described (Gabrielli et al., 13Gabrielli B.G. Lee M.S. Walker D.H. Piwnica-Worms H. Maller J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18040-18046Google Scholar). Tryptic phosphopeptides were separated by electrophoresis (pH 1.9, 1000 V, 30 min) in the first dimension and by chromatography (pyridine/butanol/acetic acid/water (3.3:5:1:4)) in the second dimension. During a search for kinases related to Wee1, we cloned a cDNA encoding a novel protein kinase, XEEK1, from a Xenopus ovary cDNA library using PCR technology. The cloning was performed in a two-step PCR in which primers corresponding to kinase domains VIb and IX were used in the first PCR to amplify total Xenopus ovary cDNA, and DNA products from the first reaction were subsequently amplified with a different set of primers corresponding to kinase domains VII and VIII to increase the specificity for kinase sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”). The final PCR products were cloned into the pCR-Script vector and subjected to DNA sequencing. After DNA sequence analysis, ∼60% of the clones contained authentic protein kinase sequences. However, only those containing novel protein kinase sequences were used to isolate full-length cDNA and subjected to further study. It has been shown recently that Wee1 kinase and its related kinases from different organisms have a unique Glu-Gly-Asp triplet within kinase domains VII and VIII (Booher et al., 3Booher R.N. Deshaies R.J. Kirschner M.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3417-3426Google Scholar; Mueller et al., 25Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6 (a): 119-134Google Scholar; Campbell et al., 5Campbell S.D. Sprenger F. Edgar B.A. O'Farrell P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1333-1347Google Scholar). One of the cloned novel protein kinases, XEEK1, which contains a Glu-Gly-Asp triplet in this region, was thus chosen for this study. A full-length XEEK1 cDNA clone from a Xenopus ovary cDNA library was isolated using the cloned kinase PCR fragment as a hybridization probe (see “Experimental Procedures”). Plasmids recovered from five positive colonies identified by the hybridization screening appeared to have identical insert sequences as judged by restriction enzyme mapping (data not shown). The sequence of the 1.9-kilobase XEEK1 cDNA open reading frame (1296 bp) encodes a protein of 432 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 49 kDa (Fig. 1A). Northern analysis of total RNA from Xenopus embryos using cloned XEEK1 cDNA as a probe identified a unique mRNA species of ∼2.0 kilobases (see below), indicating that the cDNA analyzed was full-length. The predicted amino acid sequence of XEEK1 exhibits the conserved elements of all other protein kinases within the 12 subdomains of the catalytic domain (Hanks and Quinn, 15Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-81Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that XEEK1 is most similar to the yeast SNF1 kinase, with ∼35% identity (∼65% similarity) within the catalytic domain. We have aligned the sequences of the catalytic domains from XEEK1, yeast SNF1 (Celenza and Carlson, 8Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Google Scholar), and a tobacco SNF1-related kinase, NPK5 (Muranaka et al., 27Muranaka T. Banno H. Machida Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2958-2965Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, XEEK1 displays significant homology to these kinases, especially in the amino-terminal half of the catalytic domain. Yeast SNF1 is a protein serine/threonine kinase that has a major role in regulating glucose-repressed genes in response to glucose limitation (Carlson et al., 7Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1981; 98: 25-40Google Scholar; Celenza and Carlson, 8Celenza J.L. Carlson M. Science. 1986; 233: 1175-1180Google Scholar). Both mammalian and plant homologs of the SNF1 gene have been identified and shown to functionally complement a snf1 mutation in yeast (Alderson et al., 1Alderson A. Sabelli P.A. Dickinson J.R.

To examine whether XEEK1 can complement the yeast snf1 mutation, XEEK1 was subcloned into a yeast expression vector, pMC944, in which expression is under the control of a constitutive mating factor promoter (MFα1) (Spevak et al., 36Spevak W. Keiper B.D. Stratowa C. Castañón M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4953-4966Google Scholar). Because the yeast SNF1 function is required for expression of various glucose-repressible genes in response to glucose deprivation, snf1 mutants are unable to utilize sucrose, galactose, maltose, or nonfermentable carbon sources (Carlson et al., 7Carlson M. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1981; 98: 25-40Google Scholar). After pMC944-XEEK1 was transformed into a yeast snf1 truncation mutant strain, transformants were tested for their ability to grow in medium containing either glucose, galactose, or glycerol as the sole carbon source. Only those transformants growing in the presence of glucose were viable (data not shown). The expression of XEEK1 in yeast was confirmed by immunoblotting the yeast crude extract with anti-XEEK1 serum (Fig. 2). These results suggest that XEEK1 is not a homolog of SNF1. Furthermore, when expressed in two fission yeast mitotic catastrophe mutants using a fission yeast expression vector (Su and Maller, 39Su J.Y. Maller J.L. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 145: 155-156Google Scholar, 40Su J.Y. Maller J.L. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 387-396Google Scholar), XEEK1 did not complement defects in Wee1 and Mik1 kinases (data not shown). This result suggests that XEEK1 is not functionally related to Wee1 or its related kinases.Fig. 2Expression of XEEK1 in yeast. The yeast expression construct of XEEK1, pMC944-XEEK1, or the expression vector, pMC944, alone was transformed into yeast strain MCY2916 (MAT α snf1Δ his3 ura3 lys2 leu2). URA+ transformants were selected and grown to mid-log phase in minimal synthetic medium without uracil. Sixty micrograms of crude extract protein prepared from a fresh yeast culture was then resolved by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-XEEK1 serum, and visualized by ECL. Molecular mass markers are indicated in kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Expression of the XEEK1 gene was assessed by Northern blot analysis. Hybridization of total RNA prepared from staged embryos with a probe derived from the full-length XEEK1 cDNA clone revealed a single major species of ∼2.0-kilobase mRNA (Fig. 3A). XEEK1 mRNA was detected in oocytes, eggs, and early embryos and therefore represents a maternal mRNA species. The level of XEEK1 mRNA changed significantly during early development (Fig. 3A). It was expressed at the highest level in the mature oocyte and unfertilized egg (Fig. 3A and data not shown) and declined gradually after fertilization, reaching a barely detectable level at stage 10 (gastrulation). Equal loading of RNA was judged by stripping the same blot and probing with a c-src clone, as shown in Fig. 3A (lower panel). This result clearly indicates that XEEK1 is expressed as an egg and early embryonic kinase. To examine whether the protein level of XEEK1 correlates with the mRNA during the same developmental stages, extracts of eggs and embryos were analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 3B, consistent with the RNA result, the protein level of XEEK1 also peaked in the oocyte (Fig. 3C) and unfertilized egg and began to decrease gradually upon fertilizatio"

It is, however, associated with a short hydrophilic carboxyl-terminal region, containing no cysteine, that bears no resemblance to the alternative COOH-terminal peptides of the GPI-anchored molecules (H) or of other homomeric or heteromeric tailed molecules (T). Expression of complete and truncated AChE in COS cells showed that active hydrophilic monomers are produced and secreted in all cases, and that cleavage of a very basic 8-residue carboxyl-terminal fragment occurs upon secretion. The COS cells produced Bungarus AChE about 30 times more efficiently than an equivalent secreted monomeric rat AChE. The recombinant Bungarus AChE, like the natural venom enzyme, showed a distinctive ladder pattern in nondenaturing electrophoresis, probably reflecting a variation in the number of sialic acids.By mutagenesis, we showed that two differences (methionine instead of tyrosine at position 70; lysine instead of aspartate or glutamate at position 285) explain the low sensitivity of Bungarus AChE to peripheral site inhibitors, compared to the Torpedo or mammalian AChEs. These results illustrate the importance of both the aromatic and the charged residues, and the fact that peripheral site ligands (propidium, gallamine, D-tubocurarine, and fasciculin 2) interact with diverse subsets of residues.

Despite attempts at eradication made since the 1950's, malaria is still the most important parasitic disease of man. The disease affects 300–500 million people each year and is caused by four species of Plasmodium. Plasmodium falciparum, the predominant species in tropical Africa, eastern Asia, Australasia, and the Amazon region, may cause severe morbidity and mortality (1WHO Weekly Epidemiol. Record. 1993; 68: 245-252Google Scholar). Resistance of P. falciparum to most available antimalarials is now widespread (2Wernsdorfer W.H. Kouznetsov R.L. Bull. W. H. O. 1980; 58: 341-352Google Scholar), and the development of new drugs is regarded as a priority. This task requires a thorough knowledge of the biochemistry of P. falciparum. Yet the glycobiology of the parasite, and more precisely the understanding of the role of oligosaccharides in host-parasite interaction (3Dieckmann-Schuppert A. Bender S. Odenthal-Schnittler M. Bause E. Schwarz R.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 815-825Google Scholar), is still a neglected area in malaria biochemistry. In certain parasites glycoconjugates have been shown to be important in penetration mechanisms, cellular growth, host immunity regulation, and differentiation (4Zingales B. Katzin A.M. Arruda M.V. Colli W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 16: 21-34Google Scholar, 5Funk V.A. Jardim A. Olafson R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 23-35Google Scholar, 6Wilson M.E. Hardin K.K. Donelson J.E. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 678-684Google Scholar). In P. falciparum, glycoproteins have been studied in intraerythrocytic stages. Some of them, such as HRP-1 and HRP-2, 1The abbreviations used are: HRP-1histidine-rich protein 1HRP-2histidine-rich protein 2MSP1merozoite surface protein 1TUNYCtunicamycinCHXcycloheximideDoldolicholConAconcanavalin APAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatography. are probably associated with the formation of knobs on red blood cells parasitized by mature-stage parasites. These knobs are involved in the sequestration mechanism of infected red blood cells (7Pologe L.G. Pavlovec A. Shio H. Ravetch J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7139-7143Google Scholar, 8Howard R.J. Uni S. Aikawa M. Aley S.B. Leech J.H. Lew A.M. Willems T.G. Rener J. Taylor D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1269-1277Google Scholar, 9Kilejian A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3695-3699Google Scholar). MSP-1, or Gp 195, is synthesized in trophozoites and is present in the schizont stage and on the merozoite surface (10Howard R.J. Lyon J.A. Diggs C.L. Haynes J.D. Leech J.H. Barnwell J.W. Aley S.B. Aikawa M. Miller L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 11: 349-362Google Scholar). This protein is processed in small glycosylated and unglycosylated fragments; it may be responsible for penetration mechanisms (11McBride J.S. Heidrich H.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1987; 23: 71-84Google Scholar) or related to growth during the intraerythrocytic stage (12Schimdt-Ullirch R. Brown J. Whittle H. Lin P.S. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 179-188Google Scholar). In schizonts Gp 195 is O-glycosylated and contains O-linked N-acetylglucosamine, as demonstrated by Ud-Din et al. (13Ud-Din N. Drager-Dayal R. Decrind C. Hu B. Giudice G. Hoessli D. Biochem. Int. 1992; 27: 55-64Google Scholar). During the asexual intraerythrocytic stage (at 28–40 h of culture) of P. falciparum, an apparent lack of N-glycosylation in glycoproteins was shown by use of gel filtration after specific cleavage of N-glycans or O-glycans and by the nontransference in vitro of several donors, (Dol-P-P)[14C]GlcNAc2, (Dol-P-P)GlcNAc2[14C]Man9, and (Dol-P-P)GlcNAc2[14C]Glc3, to peptide acceptors. Glycoproteins are O-GlcNAc linked in old trophozoites (at 40–45 h of culture) as shown by gel filtration, alditol analysis, and transference of Dol-P-[3H]Man and Dol-P-[3H]Glc to pentapeptides (3Dieckmann-Schuppert A.

TUNYC blocks the formation of dolichol-P-P-oligosaccharides by inhibiting the synthesis of dolichol-P-P-N-acetylglucosamine (15Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Google Scholar). In P. falciparum, it has been shown that the antibiotic inhibits development of the parasite after 96 h of treatment, without ring stage formation in the 3rd cycle of culture (3Dieckmann-Schuppert A. Bender S. Odenthal-Schnittler M. Bause E. Schwarz R.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 815-825Google Scholar, 16Udeinya I.J. Van Dyke K.

Odenthal-Schnittler M. Bause E. Schwarz R.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 815-825Google Scholar, 17Dieckmann-Schuppert A. Hensel J. Schwarz R.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 184SGoogle Scholar), which claim the absence of N-glycosylation in glycoproteins, have induced us to reinvestigate the glycosylation of proteins during the intraerythrocyte stages of P. falciparum. In this report we demonstrate the presence of N-glycosylation at the intraerythrocytic stage of P. falciparum. We also suggest that the absence of schizonts in the 2nd cycle of culture in the presence of TUNYC is due to the inhibition of the N-glycosylation pathway during the trophozoite stage. N-Linked glycoproteins presents at the trophozoite stage appear to be important for the differentiation mechanisms of the asexual erythrocytic forms of P. falciparum. Reagents were obtained from the following sources. RPMI 1640 medium, RPMI 1640 medium without glucose and methionine, Hepes, hypoxanthine, glucose, gentamycin, TUNYC, CHX, Tris, EDTA, SDS, 2-mercaptoethanol, Nonidet P-40, Triton X-100, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, iodoacetamide, Nα-p-tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, methyl α-D-mannopyranoside, methyl α-D-glucopyranoside, N-acetylglucosamine, N,N′-diacetylchitobiose, trichloroacetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, n-butyl alcohol, pyridine, dextran blue, and maltooligosaccharides were purchased from Sigma. Percoll® and concanavalin A-Sepharose were purchased from Pharmacia Chemicals (Uppsala, Sweden). Plasmagel® was purchased from Laboratoire Roger Bellon (Nevilly-sur-Seine, France). L-[35S]Methionine, D-[U-14C]glucose, D-[U-14C]mannose, and Amplify® were obtained from Amersham International (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). N-Glycanase® and O-Glycanase® were purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Bio-Gel P-4 was acquired from Bio-Rad. Standard of N-glycans: Man3GlcNAc2 and Man9GlcNAc2 were purchased from Oxford Glycosystem (Abingdon, UK). The experiments were performed with an isolate (S20) of P. falciparum obtained from a patient living in Porto Velho (State of Rondônia, Brazil) (18Katzin A.M. Kimura E.A.S. Alexandre C.O.P. Val Ramos A.M. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1991; 45: 453-462Google Scholar). The parasites were cultivated in 100-mm diameter Falcon Petri dishes and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mM Hepes, 21 mM sodium bicarbonate, 370 µM hypoxanthine, 11 mM glucose, 40 µg/ml gentamycin, and 10% (v/v) human A+ serum. Washed human O+ erythrocytes were added to the culture medium to a hematocrit of 5%. In vitro culture was carried out according to Trager and Jensen (19Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1978; 193: 673-675Google Scholar). The Petri dishes were incubated at 37°C in a candle jar with daily medium changes. Development and multiplication of the culture were followed by microscopic evaluation of Giemsa stained thin smears. Synchronization was obtained by two treatments with Plasmagel® (6% (w/v) solution of gelatin in physiological saline) (20Pasvol G. Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1978; 72: 87-88Google Scholar). Starting with asynchronous cultures, schizonts were concentrated by flotation in Plasmagel® and subcultured with fresh erythrocytes at 48-h intervals. All experiments were carried out using extracts from ring-infected, young trophozoite-infected erythrocytes (at 20–25 h of culture time), and old trophozoite-infected erythrocytes (at 35–40 h of culture time), purified on a 40/70/80% discontinuous Percoll® gradient (15,000 × g, 30 min, 25°C). This yielded an upper band from the old trophozoite stage (40%), another band from the young trophozoite stage (70–80% interface), and a pellet of ring stage and uninfected cells (21Braun-Breton C. Jendoubi M. Brunet E. Perrin L. Scaife J. Pereira da Silva L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 20: 33-43Google Scholar). Various concentrations of TUNYC (3, 6, and 12 µM) diluted in 1 mM NaOH or CHX (8, 17, and 35 µM) diluted in RPMI 1640 medium were tested. Inhibition tests were carried out in flat-bottom microtitration plates (Falcon). Freshly synchronized cultures of 5% hematocrit and 1% parasitemia (ring-stage parasites) were exposed to serial dilutions of the compound to be tested in normal culture medium. After 48 and 96 h (if not otherwise stated), the multiplication rate was assessed from the number of newly formed ring-stage parasites. The experiments with labeled parasites were performed in three different protocols. Synchronous P. falciparum ring-stage cultures, untreated or treated with 12 µM TUNYC or 17 µM CHX for 48 h, were labeled with 25 µCi/ml L-[35S]methionine (>1,000 Ci/mmol) in 10 µM methionine-deficient RPMI medium, at the beginning or after 10 h of treatment with each antibiotic (Fig. 1, arrows 1 and 3). Other synchronous cultures at the ring stage were treated with 12 µM TUNYC and at the start or after 10 h of treatment were labeled with 6.25 µCi/ml D-[U-14C]glucose (283 mCi/mmol) or D-[U-14C]mannose (289 mCi/mmol) in RPMI 1640 medium without addition of 11 mM glucose (Fig. 1, arrows 1 and 3). Aliquots were collected at different times (0–48 h), precipitated with 12% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and radioactivity was measured with a Beckman 5,000 β-counter. Other cultures were treated for 96 h with each antibiotic in the same concentrations. After 48 h of treatment with TUNYC or CHX, the cultures and nontreated controls were labeled with the same isotopes, and aliquots were precipitated at different times with trichloroacetic acid, under the conditions described above (Fig. 1, arrow 4). Cultures of P. falciparum with parasitemia around 20% (2nd cycle, 98% ring forms, 2% schizont forms) pretreated with 12 µM TUNYC for 52 h, were labeled for 18 h with various isotopes in the presence of 12 µM TUNYC (Fig. 1, arrow 5, point D). Radiolabeled amino acid L-[35S]methionine (25 µCi/ml) was incorporated into 10 µM methionine-deficient RPMI. Incorporation of D-[U-14C]glucose or D-[U-14C]mannose was performed using 6.25 µCi/ml the radiolabeled sugar in RPMI 1640 medium without addition of 11 mM glucose. All the cultures were incubated in methionine- or glucose-deficient medium for 1 h before the addition of the radioactive substance, so as to deplete endogenous stores. The cultures were then washed three times in a 10-fold volume of RPMI 1640 medium without sera. Ring, young trophozoite, and old trophozoite forms were purified by discontinuous Percoll® gradient as described above, followed by lysis of the cells in twice their volume of ice-cold 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM Nα-p-tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone and 1 µg/ml leupeptin. After incubation for 15 min at 4°C, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min, and supernatants were stored in liquid N2 for subsequent chromatography on ConA-Sepharose or SDS-PAGE analysis. P. falciparum parasites were cultured for 7 h, starting with initial parasitemia around 20% (1st cycle, 80% ring forms, 15% trophozoite forms, and 5% schizont forms). Parasites were labeled for 18 h with the same isotopes and treated as described above (Fig. 1, arrow 2, point B). Each stage, purified by Percoll® gradient, was lysed in the appropriate buffer for chromatography on a ConA-Sepharose column, for enzymatic treatment or for column gel filtration. The lysate of P. falciparum labeled with L-[35S]methionine was applied to a ConA-Sepharose column (2 × 0.8 cm), previously equilibrated with 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, and 2% (v/v) Triton X-100. Bound glycoproteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 100 mM methyl α-D-mannopyranoside and 100 mM methyl α-D-glucopyranoside. Unbound material was denominated peak 1, and the glycoproteins eluted with the specific sugars corresponded to peak 2. All fractions were independently monitored by liquid scintillation counting, pooled, and precipitated with 3 volumes of cold ethanol (22Katzin A.M. Colli W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 727: 403-411Google Scholar). After standing for 48 h at −20°C, the fractions were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C and the precipitates analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The same number of treated and untreated parasites was applied to each column for the analysis of each stage. As an additional control, parasites were purified through activated Sepharose 4B; no unspecific affinity toward the dextran was shown, since it all percolated in peak 1. Gel electrophoresis was carried out on 8% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) as described previously (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The same number of parasites at each stage, lysed in sample buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), was applied to each well for analysis. All gels were treated with Amplify®, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film with intensifying screen sets at −70°C. Ring forms and young and old trophozoites, labeled for 18 h with D-[U-14C]glucose as described under “Metabolic Labeling” (see “Protocol 3”), were lysed in buffer: 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM Nα-p-tosyl-lysine chloromethyl ketone and 1 µg/ml leupeptin. Each parasite stage was chromatographed using a Bio-Gel P-4 column (1.9 × 80 cm) equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and the distribution of radioactivity in the eluates was monitored by liquid scintillation counting. Dextran blue was used as marker for the void volume (V0). Fractions eluting in the void volume were pooled in all cases for further enzymatic treatment (24Plummer Jr., T.H. Tarentino A.L. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 257-263Google Scholar). Lysates from the three intraerythrocytic parasite stages, treated as described under “Metabolic Labeling” (“Protocol 3”) were submitted to O-Glycanase® enzyme (bovine serum albumin-free) and recombinant N-Glycanase® enzyme (glycerol-free) cleavage. Samples were denatured by boiling for 3 min in the presence of 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.2, 50 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM EDTA, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. Nonidet P-40 1% (v/v) and O-Glycanase® (2 units/ml) were added, and the sample was incubated in a water bath at 37°C for 24 h. Treatment with N-Glycanase® (0.6 unit/ml) was performed under the same conditions, except that the pH was changed to 7.4. In all chromatographic procedures involving enzymatic hydrolysis, controls without enzyme were submitted to the same experimental conditions (25Maley F. Trimble R.B. Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 195-204Google Scholar). After enzymatic hydrolysis, samples were either: (a) analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described or (b) chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-4 under the conditions described above. In every chromatographic procedure involving enzymatic hydrolysis, the amount of radioactivity spotted was 30% more than the amount used for controls; this was to ensure that disappearance was in fact due to the action of the enzyme. Acid hydrolysis was performed with 2 N trifluoroacetic acid for 3 h at 100°C. Acid was removed by several distillations with water, and the hydrolysate was analyzed by paper chromatography. Paper chromatography was carried out on Whatman No. 1 paper with n-butyl alcohol/pyridine/water (6:4:3, v/v/v) as solvent. Radioactivity was determined after cutting 1-cm paper strips. TLC was performed on silica gel 60 precoated plates (Merck), using n-propyl alcohol/ethanol/water (7:1:2, v/v/v) as solvent. For analysis of oligosaccharides obtained after N-Glycanase® digestion, double or triple developments were carried out as required. The plates were dried, sprayed with EN3HANCE spray (DuPont NEN), and exposed to X-Omat AR films at −70°C. HPLC was performed on a Spectra-Physics liquid chromatograph equipped with a refractive index detector and a Rheodyne injection valve. A Lichrospher 100 NH2 (Merck, 5 µm) column eluted with acetonitrile:water solvent system: (a) 70:30, v/v or (b) 85:15, v/v, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was used. Aliquots of 0.5 ml were collected and counted for radioactivity. Standards of GlcNAc, N,N′-diacetylchitobiose and maltooligosaccharides were used. Acid hydrolysis was performed with (100 µl) 2 N trifluoroacetic acid for 3 h at 100°C. The sample was dried in a Speedvac, re-N-acetylated in saturated solution CO3HNa by three additions of 2.5% (v/v) acetic anhydride over 30 min, re-dried, and passed through a tandem column of Dowex 50 H+ (0.5 ml) over Dowex 1 (OH−) (0.5 ml). Elution was performed with 3 ml of water. The hydrolysate was dried in Speedvac and analyzed by HPLC. Treatment of P. falciparum with 12 µM TUNYC for 96 h caused a 90% inhibition in development of the young trophozoite to the schizont stage of the second cycle, without pigment formation. This has been described elsewhere (16Udeinya I.J. Van Dyke K. Pharmacology. 1981; 23: 165-170Google Scholar, 17Dieckmann-Schuppert A. Hensel J. Schwarz R.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 184SGoogle Scholar). Parasites at the old trophozoite stage (35–40-h culture, 83–88-h TUNYC exposure) of the second cycle were interrupted in their development and died (Fig. 1, photo 6′). Parasites developed through three cycles in erythrocytes pre-treated for 48 h with 12 µM TUNYC; this suggests that inhibition does not occur as a result of drug accumulation in the erythrocytes and agrees with the findings of Dieckmann-Shuppert et al. (17Dieckmann-Schuppert A. Hensel J. Schwarz R.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 184SGoogle Scholar). Parasites treated with 8 µM CHX did not change their developmental patterns. They were able to proceed with their life cycle even in the presence of 17 µM CHX, although at that concentration a 10–15% inhibition of L-[35S]methionine incorporation was observed, as measured by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (Fig. 1, 2nd cycle, ▪). Parasites in the 1st cycle died within 30 h when treated with CHX concentrations above 35 µM. No differences have been observed in the incorporation of L-[35S]methionine, D-[U-14C]glucose, and D-[U-14C]mannose into the trichloroacetic acid pellet from 1st cycle untreated parasites by comparison with parasites treated with 12 µM TUNYC and simultaneously labeled for 48 h or even by comparison with parasites pretreated for 10 h with 12 µM TUNYC and labeled for 38 h in the presence of the antibiotic. Ring-stage synchronous cultures of P. falciparum, preincubated for 48 h with 12 µM TUNYC and labeled with each metabolic precursor for an additional 48 h in the presence of the antibiotic (Fig. 1, arrow 4), showed 10–15% inhibition of protein synthesis (Fig. 1, ○, •, 2nd cycle). Under these conditions a 60–70% inhibition of sugar incorporation was observed, an effect which was more pronounced in young trophozoites during differentiation to old trophozoites in the 2nd cycle (22–42-h culture time, 70–90-h TUNYC treatment) (Fig. 1, ▵, ▴, photos 4, 5, 6, 4′, 5′, 6′). Both treated and untreated parasites displayed asynchronous forms in the 2nd cycle after 22–30 h under culture (see “Experimental Procedures” and “Protocol 2” under “Metabolic Labeling”). Nevertheless, while untreated parasites displayed 30% of young trophozoites, 60% of old trophozoites and 10% of ring forms, TUNYC-treated parasites displayed 80% of young trophozoites, 15% of old trophozoites and 5% of ring forms. All these developmental stages were purified by discontinuous Percoll® gradient and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Electrophoretic profiles of L-[35S]methionine-labeled proteins from TUNYC (70 h)-treated or untreated parasites did not differ significantly (not shown). Previous results obtained by us have shown that very similar electrophoretic profiles can be obtained using either D-[U-14C]mannose or D-[U-14C]glucose as marker (not shown). The following experiments have thus been made only with D-[U-14C]glucose. Only slight differences (Fig. 2A) have been observed in comparison of young and old trophozoites from untreated cultures or cultures treated with TUNYC for 52 h and pulsed for 8 h with D-[U-14C]glucose in the presence of the antibiotic (cf. Fig. 1, arrow 5, point C). However, when the parasites were subjected to the same experimental protocol but pulse-labeled for 18 h (cf. Fig. 1, arrow 5, point D, photos 5 and 5′), significant differences in the electrophoretic patterns were detected among ring-stage, young, and old trophozoites of the 2nd cycle. In the ring-stage form treated with TUNYC, one band >200 kDa disappeared (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, and 1′). TUNYC-treated young trophozoites of the 2nd cycle do not show bands of 205 and 109 kDa, while other bands (93, 80, 70, 43, 30 kDa) were less intense than in the corresponding TUNYC-untreated control (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 1′). Band intensity reduction was likewise observed in TUNYC-treated old trophozoite parasites (200, 120, 104, 70, 43 kDa) when compared with antibiotic untreated controls (Fig. 2D, lanes 1 and 1′). Under identical experimental conditions, uninfected erythrocytes did not incorporate labeled sugars into glycoproteins (Fig. 2E) (see 3Dieckmann-Schuppert A. Bender S. Odenthal-Schnittler M. Bause E. Schwarz R.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 815-825Google Scholar, 13Ud-Din N. Drager-Dayal R. Decrind C. Hu B. Giudice G. Hoessli D. Biochem. Int. 1992; 27: 55-64Google Scholar, 26Varki A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 16-32Google Scholar, and 27). When forms of the 1st erythrocytic stage are employed, TUNYC treatment does not affect biosynthesis of glycoproteins (Fig. 1); this is confirmed by SDS-PAGE and analysis of peaks 1 and 2 of L-[35S]methionine-labeled parasites subjected to ConA-Sepharose columns (not shown). These results confirm similar conclusions by Dieckmann-Shuppert et al. (3Dieckmann-Schuppert A. Bender S. Odenthal-Schnittler M. Bause E. Schwarz R.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 815-825Google Scholar, 17Dieckmann-Schuppert A. Hensel J. Schwarz R.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 184SGoogle Scholar) using SDS-PAGE analysis. Parasites, untreated or treated with 12 µM TUNYC for 52 h and incubated with L-[35S]methionine for an additional 18 h (see “Experimental Procedures” and “Protocol 2” under “Metabolic Labeling,”Fig. 1, arrow 5, point D), were chromatographed on ConA-Sepharose. In the ring stage, no significant differences were detect in peaks 1 and 2 from treated and untreated parasites (Fig. 3A). However, in young trophozoite-stage parasites of the 2nd cycle differences became apparent in the material that bound to ConA-Sepharose (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 2′). TUNYC treatment caused the disappearance of bands of 205 and 109 kDa and bands in the range from 97 to 30 kDa. Concomitantly, these bands were intensified in peak 1, which suggests that the difference observed can only be ascribed to the lack of carbohydrate residues after TUNYC treatment. When TUNYC-treated and -untreated old trophozoites of the 2nd cycle were compared, the only difference found was a protein band of 43 kDa (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 2′). In order to confirm the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides in P. falciparum proteins, peak 2 of ConA-Sepharose chromatography of non-TUNYC-treated young 1st cycle trophozoites (labeled with L-[35S]methionine as described under “Experimental Procedures” and “protocol 3” under “Metabolic Labeling”) was treated with N-Glycanase® or O-Glycanase® after purification by affinity chromatography. After N-Glycanase® treatment, the fraction was rechromatographed on ConA-Sepharose; proteins of 205 kDa and in the range of 109–30 kDa, which had previously eluted in peak 2, now appeared in peak 1 (Fig. 4, lanes 1, 2, and 3). Treatment with O-Glycanase® produced quantitative, but not qualitative, differences when peaks 1 and 2 were compared (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5). Old trophozoites were not affected by N-Glycanase® treatment, whereas O-Glycanase® hydrolyzed the carbohydrate residues of proteins present in peak 2 (not shown). An asynchronous culture of P. falciparum (25% parasitemia) was metabolically labeled with D-[U-14C]glucose for 18 h and each stage was separated on a discontinuous Percoll® gradient and treated with N-Glycanase® or O-Glycanase®. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In the ring stage, one band of >200 kDa disappeared after treatment with N-Glycanase® (Fig. 5A, lane 3). Bands ranging from to 130 to 80 kDa were sensitive to O-Glycanase® treatment, but the >200-kDa band did not disappear after this treatment (Fig. 5A, lane 2). In the young trophozoite stage, bands of 205, 109, 93, and 80 kDa disappeared or decreased in intensity after N-Glycanase® treatment (Fig. 5B, lane 3); this was not the case with O-Glycanase®, which did not substantially alter the electrophoretic profiles (Fig. 5B, lane 2). In the old trophozoite stage, changes in bands of 70 kDa and 45–40 kDa were detected after N-Glycanase® treatment (Fig. 5C, lane 2), whereas after treatment with O-Glycanase®, all bands disappeared or decreased in intensity with the exception of a 45–40-kDa band (Fig. 5C, lane 3). Asynchronous cultures of P. falciparum (25% parasitemia) labeled for 18 h with D-[U-14C]glucose (Fig. 1, arrow 2, point B) were purified by discontinuous Percoll® gradient. Each stage was lysed in buffer as described above for gel filtration column analysis, and each V0 was recovered and subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis with N- or O-Glycanase®. Comparison of chromatographic profiles showed that the material recovered in the V0 contained 48.4, 22.3, and 32.5%, respectively, of the total radioactivity incorporated by ring, young-trophozoite, and old-trophozoite forms (Fig. 6, A1, B1, and C1). These V0 peaks were divided into three aliquots, two of which were treated respectively with N-Glycanase® and O-Glycanase®, while the third was left untreated. Experimental conditions were otherwise the same for the three aliquots. All three aliquots were then rechromatographed on Bio-Gel P-4. Recovery in V0 of the control sample (no enzyme added) was 100% of the radioactivity (Fig. 6, A2, B2 and C2). The distribution of radioactivity after N-Glycanase® treatment was 28.8% in V0 and 71.19% of included material (ring forms), 29.40% in V0, and 70.60% of included material (young trophozoites) and 71% in V0 and 29% of included material (old trophozoites) (Fig. 6, A3, B3, and C3, respectively). The distribution of radioactivity after O-Glycanase® treatment was 66.96% in V0 and 33.03% of included material (ring forms, Fig. 6, A4), 66.30% in V0 and 33.70% of included material (young trophozoites, Fig. 6, B4) an"

INTRODUCTIONAn emerging hallmark of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes is the assembly of multiprotein complexes at the enhancer and promoter regions of target genes (1Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). These complexes are formed and stabilized through multiple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. Tissue specificity of many liver-specific genes, the expression of which is restricted to the liver, is imparted by combinatorial interactions between liver-enriched and ubiquitous transcription factors (2Lai E. Darnell J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 427-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Xanthopoulos K.G. Mirkovitch J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The unique expression program of a hepatic gene is thus primarily determined by the configuration of cis-elements containing binding sites for these factors and may be fine tuned by secondary interactions among the proteins.The liver-specific enhancer of the gene encoding apolipoprotein AI (apoAI), 1The abbreviations used are: apoAIapolipoprotein AIHNFhepatocyte nuclear factorLUCluciferaseEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayERestrogen receptor. the major protein component of high density lipoprotein (reviewed in Ref. 4Karathanasis S.K.

Sites A and C serve as sites of action for many nuclear receptors including retinoid X receptor α (6Rottman J.N. Widom R.L. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28220-28226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Maximal activity of the apoAI enhancer depends upon the integrity of each of the sites A, B, and C, suggesting that synergistic interactions resulting from a factor binding to them dominate transcription activation from the enhancer (5Widom R.L. Ladias J.A.A. Kouidou S. Karathanasis S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).In previous studies, we showed that the apoAI enhancer can be activated in non-hepatic cell types if hepatocyte-enriched factors HNF-4 and HNF-3β are also provided (11Harnish D.C. Malik S. Karathanasis S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28220-28226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current report, we first define the minimum requirements for efficient enhancer function and then experimentally address several possible explanations for how the transcriptional synergy may arise. Our results suggest that the synergy may result from an additional factor, possibly a coactivator, acting in concert with the liver-enriched transcription factors HNF-3 and HNF-4.DISCUSSIONEarly models for transcriptional synergy among distinct cis-acting modules (28Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar) postulated that synergy may result from cooperative binding of the transcription factors to their respective cognate sites (29Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 355: 683-689Crossref Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Alternatively, multiple secondary interactions of enhancer-bound factors with targets in the core transcription machinery could result in transcriptional synergy (23Sheldon M. Reinberg D. Current Biol. 1995; 5: 43-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Chi T. Lieberman P. Ellwood K. Carey M. Nature. 1995; 377: 254-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 30Lin Y.S. Green M.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 971-981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 31Lin Y.S. Carey M. Ptashne M. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The latter could occur directly, involving components of the RNA polymerase II-specific basal transcriptional factors (including the TATA box-binding protein-associated factors; Refs. 32Hoey T. Weinzierl R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.-L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar and 33Chen J.-L. Attardi L.D. Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 79: 93-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) or indirectly, through adaptors and/or coactivators that serve to bridge the enhancer and core complexes (1Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 34Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar).The present data unequivocally rule out cooperative DNA binding of HNF-3 and HNF-4 as a contributing factor for the synergistic transactivation of the apoAI enhancer. Therefore, it is likely that these factors synergize at a secondary level wherein protein-protein interactions with the transcription machinery are exclusively used. Similar conclusions have also been reached by other studies investigating the molecular basis of transcriptional synergy (35Metzger S. Halaas J.L. Breslow J.L. Sladek F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16831-16838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Martinez E. Dusserre Y. Wahli W. Mermod N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2937-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 37Wu K.-J. Wilson D. Shih C. Darlington G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1177-1182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our observation that the cell type repertoire in which this synergy operates is rather limited raises the possibility that the factor responsible for this synergy is unlikely to be one of the ubiquitous basal transcriptional factors or the TATA box-binding protein-associated factors. Cell type-restricted coactivators have been described recently (38Luo Y. Fujii H. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 231-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 39Strubin M. Newell J.W. Matthias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and are thus plausible candidates for factors through which HNF-3 and HNF-4 might channel their combined transactivation potential. Therefore, we propose that an intermediary factor normally present in liver cells is recruited to the enhancer and core transcription complexes when both HNF-3 and HNF-4 occupy their binding sites but not with either of them occupying their cognate sites individually (Fig. 2B). In this way, this factor, in addition to simply being an adaptor molecule, could also function to integrate the signals regulating the primary transcription factors (HNF-3 and HNF-4).This observation also adds another level at which apoAI tissue restriction is enforced. Thus, it is not expressed in some extrahepatic tissues because they lack the primary transcription factors, and in others, because the intermediary factor is absent. It also follows that the expression through the enhancer could be modulated by regulating the activity of this factor in addition to regulation of the primary transcription factors HNF-3 and HNF-4.Indeed, our results raise the possibility that estrogen may be among the physiologically relevant signals using such a pathway to modulate apoAI expression. Although the estrogen response is primarily mediated by site A-bound HNF-4 (Fig. 8A), it is interesting that estrogen stimulation of HNF-4 activity (in the absence of cotransfected HNF-3) also required an intact site B (Fig. 8B). This may be due to a DNA-binding factor present in CV-1 cells that can substitute for HNF-3 or, less likely, to site B-dependent allosteric influences in HNF-4 activity. Thus, since estrogen stimulates apoAI enhancer activity through a mechanism that relies on factors binding to both sites A (HNF-4) and B (either HNF-3 or a CV-1 factor), it could, in accord with our suggestion, influence an intermediary factor responsible for the synergy. Although this could be a secondary effect of the liganded ER (i.e. through induction of an alternative intermediary factor) an intriguing interpretation is that the receptor per se facilitates communication of the enhancer-bound HNF-4 (and of HNF-3 in collaboration with HNF-4; Fig. 8) with the basal transcription complex. Since no consensus estrogen response element is discernible in the apoAI minimal enhancer, this is reminiscent of the involvement of the ER in activating the brain creatine kinase gene promoter (40Sukovich D.A. Mukherjee R. Benfield P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7134-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or the fos-jun complex at the ovalbumin gene promoter (41Gaub M.-P. Bellard M. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Sassne-Corsi P. Cell. 1990; 63: 1267-1276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). As in our model, the ER is thought to be tethered to the nucleoprotein complex solely by protein-protein interactions as in each of these examples.

In the current report, we first define the minimum requirements for efficient enhancer function and then experimentally address several possible explanations for how the transcriptional synergy may arise. Our results suggest that the synergy may result from an additional factor, possibly a coactivator, acting in concert with the liver-enriched transcription factors HNF-3 and HNF-4. An emerging hallmark of transcriptional regulation in eukaryotes is the assembly of multiprotein complexes at the enhancer and promoter regions of target genes (1Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). These complexes are formed and stabilized through multiple protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. Tissue specificity of many liver-specific genes, the expression of which is restricted to the liver, is imparted by combinatorial interactions between liver-enriched and ubiquitous transcription factors (2Lai E. Darnell J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 427-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Xanthopoulos K.G. Mirkovitch J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The unique expression program of a hepatic gene is thus primarily determined by the configuration of cis-elements containing binding sites for these factors and may be fine tuned by secondary interactions among the proteins.

Maximal activity of the apoAI enhancer depends upon the integrity of each of the sites A, B, and C, suggesting that synergistic interactions resulting from a factor binding to them dominate transcription activation from the enhancer (5Widom R.L.

DISCUSSIONEarly models for transcriptional synergy among distinct cis-acting modules (28Mitchell P.J. Tjian R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar) postulated that synergy may result from cooperative binding of the transcription factors to their respective cognate sites (29Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 355: 683-689Crossref Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Alternatively, multiple secondary interactions of enhancer-bound factors with targets in the core transcription machinery could result in transcriptional synergy (23Sheldon M. Reinberg D. Current Biol. 1995; 5: 43-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24Chi T. Lieberman P. Ellwood K. Carey M.

The latter could occur directly, involving components of the RNA polymerase II-specific basal transcriptional factors (including the TATA box-binding protein-associated factors; Refs. 32Hoey T.

Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 34Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar).The present data unequivocally rule out cooperative DNA binding of HNF-3 and HNF-4 as a contributing factor for the synergistic transactivation of the apoAI enhancer. Therefore, it is likely that these factors synergize at a secondary level wherein protein-protein interactions with the transcription machinery are exclusively used. Similar conclusions have also been reached by other studies investigating the molecular basis of transcriptional synergy (35Metzger S. Halaas J.L. Breslow J.L. Sladek F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16831-16838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Martinez E. Dusserre Y. Wahli W. Mermod N. Mol. Cell.

However, our observation that the cell type repertoire in which this synergy operates is rather limited raises the possibility that the factor responsible for this synergy is unlikely to be one of the ubiquitous basal transcriptional factors or the TATA box-binding protein-associated factors. Cell type-restricted coactivators have been described recently (38Luo Y. Fujii H. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 231-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 39Strubin M. Newell J.W. Matthias P. Cell. 1995; 80: 497-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and are thus plausible candidates for factors through which HNF-3 and HNF-4 might channel their combined transactivation potential. Therefore, we propose that an intermediary factor normally present in liver cells is recruited to the enhancer and core transcription complexes when both HNF-3 and HNF-4 occupy their binding sites but not with either of them occupying their cognate sites individually (Fig. 2B). In this way, this factor, in addition to simply being an adaptor molecule, could also function to integrate the signals regulating the primary transcription factors (HNF-3 and HNF-4).This observation also adds another level at which apoAI tissue restriction is enforced. Thus, it is not expressed in some extrahepatic tissues because they lack the primary transcription factors, and in others, because the intermediary factor is absent. It also follows that the expression through the enhancer could be modulated by regulating the activity of this factor in addition to regulation of the primary transcription factors HNF-3 and HNF-4.Indeed, our results raise the possibility that estrogen may be among the physiologically relevant signals using such a pathway to modulate apoAI expression. Although the estrogen response is primarily mediated by site A-bound HNF-4 (Fig. 8A), it is interesting that estrogen stimulation of HNF-4 activity (in the absence of cotransfected HNF-3) also required an intact site B (Fig. 8B). This may be due to a DNA-binding factor present in CV-1 cells that can substitute for HNF-3 or, less likely, to site B-dependent allosteric influences in HNF-4 activity. Thus, since estrogen stimulates apoAI enhancer activity through a mechanism that relies on factors binding to both sites A (HNF-4) and B (either HNF-3 or a CV-1 factor), it could, in accord with our suggestion, influence an intermediary factor responsible for the synergy. Although this could be a secondary effect of the liganded ER (i.e. through induction of an alternative intermediary factor) an intriguing interpretation is that the receptor per se facilitates communication of the enhancer-bound HNF-4 (and of HNF-3 in collaboration with HNF-4; Fig. 8) with the basal transcription complex. Since no consensus estrogen response element is discernible in the apoAI minimal enhancer, this is reminiscent of the involvement of the ER in activating the brain creatine kinase gene promoter (40Sukovich D.A. Mukherjee R. Benfield P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7134-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) or the fos-jun complex at the ovalbumin gene promoter (41Gaub M.-P. Bellard M. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Sassne-Corsi P. Cell. 1990; 63: 1267-1276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar).

Inappropriate transcriptional inactivation of MGMT, therefore, does not require methylation of transcription factor binding sites within the 5′-CpG island.

Mutation of 3 sites, Ser190 at the N terminus of A-receptors, a cluster of serines just upstream of the DBD, or Ser676 in the hinge region, inhibits transcription by 20-50% depending on cell or promoter context. These sites lie outside the AF1 activation function. M-series mutants are substrates for a hormone-dependent phosphorylation step, and they all bind well to DNA. Progressive mutation of the B-series clusters leads to the gradual dephosphorylation of BUS, but only the 6-site mutant, involving 10 serine residues, is completely dephosphorylated. These data suggest that in BUS alternate serines are phosphorylated or dephosphorylated at any time. However, even when BUS is completely dephosphorylated, both BUS-DBD-NLS and full-length B-receptors remain strong transactivators. Mutant B-receptors also do not acquire the dominant negative properties of A-receptors, and they retain the ability to activate transcription in synergy with 8-Br-cAMP and antiprogestins. We conclude that phosphorylation has subtle effects on the complex transcriptional repertoire that distinguishes the two hPR isoforms and does not influence transactivation mediated by AF1 or AF3, but subserves other functions.

The steroid/thyroid receptor family of proteins are ligand-activated transcription factors. Like many other transcription factors, steroid receptors are phosphorylated at sites and for functions that are under intensive study (1Hunter T. Karin M.

Four phosphoserines have been sequenced in cPR; all in Ser-Pro proline-directed kinase consensus sites. Of 5 confirmed sites in hPR, only 1, Ser345, shares homology with a known cPR site (Ser260). Three of the sequenced hPR sites are in BUS, the 164-amino acid B-upstream segment unique to the B-isoform (15Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol.

In vivo treatments that raise cellular cAMP levels increase cPR-mediated transcription in a ligand-independent manner, but have not been shown to increase phosphate incorporation by the receptors (27Denner L.A. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W. Weigel N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16548-16555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Denner L.A. Weigel N.L. Maxwell B.L. Schrader W.T. O'Malley B.W.

Science. 1991; 254: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Transactivation by hPR is also increased by treatments that raise cellular cAMP levels; an effect that requires ligand occupancy (30Beck C.A. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31Sartorius C.A. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9262-9266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the robust transcription produced by synergism between cAMP-dependent protein kinase and ligand-occupied hPR is not accompanied by obvious changes in the phosphorylation state of the receptors. Of the 5 sequenced phosphoserines in hPR and 4 in cPR, none have been shown to be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C. There are two phosphorylation states of hPR: a basal state characteristic of unliganded holoreceptors and a ligand-induced state in which phosphate incorporation is severalfold higher than basal. The ligand-induced hyperphosphorylation of hPR is further subdivided into a DNA binding-independent stage and a DNA binding-dependent stage (32Takimoto G.S. Tasset D.M. Eppert A.C. Horwitz K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3050-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Bagchi M.K. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2664-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the function of phosphorylation remains unknown. It has been speculated to play a role in regulation of transcription and, indeed, for human estrogen receptors (hER) and mouse glucocorticoid receptors (mGR), modest reductions in transcriptional activity have been observed using site-directed mutants. Bai et al. (37Bai W. Tullos S. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1465-1473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that phosphorylation of Ser530 in the hinge region of cPR increases their transcriptional activity; an effect observed only at low ligand concentrations. On the other hand, mutation of all 5 putative phosphoserines in tau1 of hGR has no effect on transcription (34Almlof T. Wright A.P.H. Gustafsson J.-Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17535-17540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Of course, a role for phosphorylation in functions other than transcription is also possible, as, for example, in ligand-induced dimerization or DNA binding (35Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1451-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 36Arnold S.F. Notides A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7475-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Analysis of phosphorylation function in hPR is complicated by the existence of two isoforms: B-receptors which contain BUS at their N termini and A-receptors which lack it. B- and A-receptors have important functional differences in response to agonists (38Meyer M.-E. Pornon A. Ji J. Bocquel M.-T. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9262-9266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41McDonnell D.P. Goldman M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11945-11949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Beck C.A.

These differences appear to reside in BUS, which contains a strong autonomous activation function (AF3) and is heavily phosphorylated (6Sheridan P.L. Evans R.M. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6520-6528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zhang Y. Beck C.A. Poletti A. Edwards D.P. Weigel N.L. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). No phosphoserines have yet been localized within AF1, which lies in the N terminus just upstream of the DBD. Two phosphoserines map to the region between the A-receptor translation start site and AF1 which includes a region that possesses a transcriptional inhibitory function in the context of A-receptors. 2A. Rudie Hovland, R. L. Powell, G. S. Takimoto, L. Tung, and K. B. Horwitz, submitted for publication. We have undertaken an extensive series of studies to test the role of hPR phosphorylation on DNA binding and transcriptional activity and constructed two series of serine to alanine substitution mutants. The M-series mutants (Fig. 1) involve 10 clusters of serine residues located in the N-terminal arm or hinge region common to both isoforms, cloned into the background of either A- or B-receptors, and include all Ser-Pro and potential CKII motifs in or around AF1. The B-series mutants (Fig. 1) involve 6 serine clusters located in BUS, cloned into BUS-DBD-NLS (40Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and into full-length B-receptors, and include all Ser-Pro motifs that might influence AF3. Using the M-series mutants in the background of full-length B- or A-receptors, we observe no effects on DNA binding with any of the mutants and modest effects on transactivation, dependent on cell and promoter context with 3 out of 10 mutants. Using the B-series mutants, we find that completely dephosphorylated BUS-DBD-NLS constructs retain the strong AF3 transactivating capacity of their wild-type counterparts. Additionally, the unique properties of RU486-occupied full-length B-receptors are retained despite complete BUS dephosphorylation. We conclude that phosphorylation has subtle overall effects on hPR transcription and that neither the activation function of AF3 in BUS, nor of AF1 in the N terminus, is controlled by its phosphorylation state. Complementary DNAs, hPR2 and hPR1, encoding A- and B-receptors, respectively, cloned into the pSG5 expression vector (44Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar) were gifts from P. Chambon (Strasbourg, France). BUS-DBD-NLS cloned into pSG5 was described in Sartorius et al. (40Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). M- and B-series site-specific serine to alanine substitution mutants were made either by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis employing a single-stranded template DNA (45Takimoto G.S. Tasset D.M. Miller L.A. Horwitz K.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 39: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using overlapping primer products to generate a heteroduplex with the mutant residues placed within a DNA fragment containing convenient restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends (46Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 177Google Scholar). For screening purposes, new restriction sites were introduced within or adjacent to the nucleotide sequence associated with the serine to alanine mutation. Individual mutants, particularly those within the B-series BUS-DBD-NLS, were grouped to form combination mutants. The B12 mutant was constructed by PCR amplification of a fragment in the B1 mutant containing AvrII and SacI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. This fragment was then subcloned into the large AvrII/SacI vector-containing fragment of the B2 mutant plasmid. Ligation at the SacI site recreated the B2 mutant resulting in the B12 combination mutant. The B123 combination mutant was constructed by PCR amplification of an AvrII/PstI fragment in the B12 mutant plasmid. This fragment was then subcloned into the AvrII/PstI-digested B3 mutant plasmid. The B1234 combination mutant was constructed by PCR amplification of a PstI/BglII fragment from the B4 mutant plasmid and was subcloned into the PstI/BglII-digested B123 mutant plasmid. The B12345 combination mutant was constructed by PCR amplification of a PstI/BglII fragment from a B45 combination mutant plasmid, which was subcloned into the B123 combination mutant plasmid. The B45 combination mutant plasmid was constructed by digesting the B4 and B5 plasmids with BstEII/RsrII and subcloning the small fragment from the B5 plasmid into the large fragment from the B4 plasmid. The CK mutant was constructed in both the wild-type BUS-DBD-NLS construct and the BUS12345-DBD-NLS combination mutant plasmids. All BUS individual and combination mutants were inserted into the hPR1 plasmid encoding full-length B-receptors by subcloning either an EcoRI/BstEII or EcoRI/RsrII fragment from the mutant BUS-DBD-NLS plasmid into the hPR1 wild-type plasmid. All mutants were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. All mutant plasmids were transfected into COS-1 or HeLa cells, and the molecular size and structure of the expressed proteins were determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblotting as described previously (32Takimoto G.S. Tasset D.M. Eppert A.C. Horwitz K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3050-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Transient transfections into PR-negative COS-1 monkey kidney epithelial, HeLa human cervicocarcinoma, and T47DD human breast cancer cells were performed by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (31Sartorius C.A. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9262-9266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Receptors included wild-type and mutant hPR expression plasmids and the human estrogen receptor (hER) expression vector HEGO (47Tora L. Mullick A. Metzger D. Ponglikitmongkol M. Park I. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1981-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) (a gift of P. Chambon). Reporter plasmids PRE-tkHSV, PRE2-TATAAd2MLP, and MMTV-CAT were gifts of P. Chambon. PRE2-TATAtk-CAT was constructed as described previously (31Sartorius C.A. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9262-9266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the two PREs were replaced by two EREs derived from the vitellogenin promoter to generate ERE2-TATAtk-CAT. β-Galactosidase expression plasmids, pCH110 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or CMV-β-gal (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), were used to correct for transfection efficiency, and the Bluescribe plasmid (Stratagene) was used as a carrier. Wild-type and mutant expression plasmids were also transiently transfected into HeLa cells containing the stably integrated MMTV-CAT promoter-reporter introduced into these PR-negative cells as described previously (48Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.P. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3868-3877PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transiently transfected with full-length hPR1, hPR2, or their respective mutants, were treated with R5020 or alcohol vehicle 10 min prior to the addition of [32P]orthophosphate (0.15 mCi/ml of medium) as described previously (6Sheridan P.L. Evans R.M. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6520-6528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 4 to 17 h after incubation with [32P]orthophosphate, homogenized in buffer containing 0.6 M KCl, desalted over Sephadex G-25, and immunoprecipitated with B-30 and/or AB52 monoclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitated receptors were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, immunoblotted with mAb B-30 and/or AB-52, and the specific bands were visualized on x-ray film by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham), as described previously (48Sartorius C.A. Groshong S.D. Miller L.A. Powell R.P. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3868-3877PubMed Google Scholar). The sheets were air-dried, the chemiluminescence was allowed to decay over 24 h, and the 32P radioactivity present in receptor-associated bands was visualized by autoradiography of another x-ray film. Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described (31Sartorius C.A. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9262-9266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using whole cell extracts prepared from transfected COS-1 cells. Hormone (0.1 µM R5020) was added 2 h prior to cell harvest. 32P-Labeled oligonucleotide probes were 27 base pairs in length and contained either a palindromic progesterone response element (PRE) from the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) promoter, or the distal palindromic PRE of the MMTV long terminal repeat (30Beck C.A.

A. 1992; 89: 3050-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Twenty-four h after transfection, the cell medium was changed and the cells were incubated with or without R5020 for an additional 24 h. Cells were then harvested, and lysates were analyzed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), as described previously (40Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The specific amino acids mutated, and their designations are illustrated in Fig. 1. Among the mutated residues are ones that have been identified as phosphoserines in hPR (* in Fig. 1) including Ser81 (BCK), Ser102 (B3), Ser162 (B5), and Ser345 (M3); ones that have been identified as phosphoserines in cPR and bear homology to sites in hPR including Ser345 (M3) and Ser676 (MH); and ones that represent consensus phosphorylation sites for CKII and proline-directed kinases and have at least a Ser-Pro motif. In the M-series mutants, 10 clusters of serine residues located downstream of Met165 in regions common to both PR isoforms were mutated in expression vectors encoding both isoforms. In the B-series mutants, 6 clusters of serine residues located in BUS were mutated in BUS-DBD-NLS and in the full-length B-receptors.

Initial studies involved a series of 9 different serine to alanine mutant clusters located in the N terminus of A-receptors upstream of the DBD (designated M1 to M9) and 1 located in the hinge region downstream of the DBD (designated MH) (Fig. 1). Mutants M5 to M9 either surround or are located within the AF1 transcription activation domain. The mutant proteins were all well expressed as demonstrated by immunoblotting (not all shown, but see Fig. 3). They were tested for transcriptional activity by transient cotransfection with the minimal PRE2-TATAAd2MLP and PRE2-TATAtk promoters or the complex PRE-tkHSV promoter, using either HeLa or COS cells. Transcription of the CAT gene by a majority of these constructs when occupied by R5020 was no different than transcription by wild-type A-receptor controls (data not shown). Three sets of A-receptor mutants, M1, M9, and MH, described in Fig. 1, have some inhibitory effects on transcription, that are promoter- and cell-specific (Figs. 2, A and B). In COS cells (Fig. 2A), M1 mutants were less active on the simple PRE2-TATAAd2MLP promoter than on the complex PRE-tkHSV promoter; M9 and MH were weaker receptors than wild-type A-receptors on both promoters. In HeLa cells (Fig. 2B), transcription controlled by M1 and M9 is variable and promoter-dependent, and no clear rules can be deduced. The MH hinge region mutation at Ser676 appears to have the most consistent deleterious effect on A-receptor activity. The data in Fig. 2 represent average values for duplicates of 2-8 assays per set and include the range of variability among assays. The overall impression is that these three mutants have a 20-50% transcription inhibitory effect. Mutants M1, M9, and MH were also cloned into the B-receptor expression vector and tested on PRE2-TATAtk in HeLa cells, with results analogous to those seen with their A-receptor counterparts (data not shown).Fig. 2Transcriptional activity of M-series mutants according to cell and promoter tested.

Affinities (Kd values) between 0.03 and 0.5 nM have been reported for IGF-I/IGFBP-3 binding, but no kinetic data are available. In this study we measured the high affinity binding of unlabeled IGFs and IGF analogues to recombinant unglycosylated IGFBP-3, using a BIAcore™ instrument (Pharmacia Biosensor AB). IGF-I binding showed fast association and slow non-first-order dissociation kinetics, and an equilibrium Kd of 0.23 nM. IGF-II had similar kinetics with slightly higher affinity. Analogues with mutations in the first 3 amino acids of the B-region (des(1–3) IGF-I and long IGF-I) showed 25 and 50 times lower affinity than IGF-I. Replacement of residues 28–37 by Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly or deletion of residues 29–41 in the C-region had little effect on the kinetic parameters, contrasting with the markedly impaired binding of these analogues to the IGF-I receptor. Swapping of the disulfide bridges in IGF-I and the C-region mutants decreased the affinity dramatically for IGFBP-3, primarily by decreasing the association rate.

LeRoith D. Insulin-like Growth Factors: Molecular and Cellular Aspects. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 49Google Scholar). The peptides consist of four regions: A- and B-regions, which are homologous to the A and B chains of insulin; a C-region, which is analogous to but unrelated to the C peptide of insulin that connects the A- and B-regions; and a short carboxyl-terminal D-region, with no counterpart in insulin (2LeRoith D. Clemmons D. Nissley P. Rechler M.M. Ann. Intern. Med. 1992; 116: 854-862Google Scholar, 3Sussenbach J.S. Steenbergh P.H. Holthuizen P. Growth Regul. 1992; 2: 1-9Google Scholar).IGF-I and -II form complexes with six different IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) in the circulation and in the extracellular environment (4Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1994; 1: 16-21Google Scholar). In the circulation the majority of IGFs are bound in a 140-kDa complex consisting of IGFBP-3 of 40–50 kDa, an approximately 85-kDa so-called acid-labile subunit, and IGF-I or IGF-II (5Baxter R.C.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6898-6902Google Scholar). The IGFs bind to IGFBP-3 with high affinity, and the acid-labile subunit is then capable of binding to the formed complex with a somewhat lower affinity (11Baxter R.C. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 60-65Google Scholar). The major biological function of IGFBP-3 is believed to be to extend the circulating half-lives of IGFs, since IGFs bound to the 140-kDa complex are cleared from the circulation much slower than free IGFs (12Guler H. Zapf J. Schmid C. Froesch E.R. Acta Endocrinol. 1989; 121: 753-758Google Scholar).Wild type IGFBP-3 is heavily glycosylated, which results in an apparent molecular mass of 40–50 kDa on denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, while the non-glycosylated molecule has a molecular mass of approximately 29 kDa. The non-glycosylated protein's binding characteristics are reported to be identical to those of the wild type molecule (13Tressel T.J. Tatsuno G.P. Spratt K. Sommer A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 625-633Google Scholar).Attempts have been made to identify the regions of IGF-I involved in the high affinity binding to IGFBP-3 by constructing insulin/IGF-I hybrids and by using site-directed mutagenesis of the IGF-I gene. From the studies involving insulin/IGF-I hybrids, it was established that the B-region but not the D-region of IGF-I is important for binding to IGFBP-3 (14Joshi S. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4208-4214Google Scholar, 15Joshi S. Ogawa H. Burke G.T. Tseng L.Y.-H. Rechler M.M. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

From the studies using site-directed mutagenesis, it was found that the C-region is of less importance than the B-region for high affinity binding to IGFBP-3 (17Bayne M.L. Applebaum J. Underwood D. Chicchi G.G. Green B.G. Hayes N.S. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11004-11008Google Scholar), and that residues 3 and 4, the region between residues 8 and 18, and residues 49–51 appear to be most important for IGFBP-3 binding (11Baxter R.C. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 60-65Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the detailed association and dissociation binding kinetics between IGFBP-3 and IGF-I, IGF-II, insulin, and seven synthetic IGF-I analogues with mutations in the B- or C-regions and with normal and swapped disulfide bridges. In order to generate detailed kinetics, we have employed the BIAcore™ instrument developed by Pharmacia, and analyzed the data by using computer fitting programs developed at the Hagedorn Research Institute.The BIAcore™ technology makes it possible to visualize macromolecular interactions directly and in “real time” (18Fägerstam L.G. Frostell-Karlsson A. Karlsson R. Persson B. Ronnberg I. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 597: 397-410Google Scholar). The BIAcore is a biosensor-based instrument that uses surface plasmon resonance as the detection principle. One molecule of the interaction to be studied is immobilized covalently to a sensor chip, and the other interactant is then passed over the chip in solution. The detection system measures and displays on a computer screen a signal proportional to the mass of protein bound to the surface. In this way, the association phase can be directly visualized as the ligand-containing solution flows over the surface, and the subsequent dissociation is similarly displayed after the flow switches to buffer containing no ligand (18Fägerstam L.G. Frostell-Karlsson A. Karlsson R. Persson B. Ronnberg I. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 597: 397-410Google Scholar).The determination of the binding kinetics of IGF-I analogues toward IGFBP-3 is important for the development of IGF-I analogues with reduced affinity for IGFBP-3 and normal affinity for the IGF-I receptor, which could be of clinical interest.RESULTSTo study the binding of IGF-I/analogue to IGFBP-3, the binding protein was immobilized to the BIAcore sensor chip as described above. Kinetic binding assays were carried out for IGF-I, IGF-II, human insulin, and seven IGF-I analogues with the following code names and mutations: des(1–3) IGF-I (deletion of amino acids 1–3), long IGF-I (possessing a 13-amino acid extension at the NH2 terminus, and amino acid at position 3 changed from Glu to Arg), 4-Gly IGF-I (IGF-I with residues 28–37 replaced by a 4-glycine bridge), mini-IGF-I (deletion of the C-region residues 28–41). There are three proteins with swapped disulfide bridges: IGF-I swap, mini-IGF-I swap, and 4-Gly IGF-I swap, where swap indicates that the disulfide bridge normally connecting residue 52 to 47 now connects residue 52 to 48, and the disulfide bridge normally connecting residue 6 to 48 now connects residue 6 to 47. The analogues can be divided into four groups according to their mutations; the wild type hormones IGF-I, IGF-II and insulin, the C-region mutants 4-Gly IGF-I and mini-IGF-I, the B-region mutants des(1–3) IGF-I and long IGF-I, and finally the analogues with swapped disulfide bridges IGF-I swap, 4-Gly IGF-I swap, and mini-IGF-I swap. Fig. 3 shows examples of association and dissociation curves for the analogues grouped according to their mutations. Sensorgrams are shown prior to correction for refractive index shift, and the figures show the curve for IGF-I for comparison. In each experiment, the assays were carried out at a ligand concentration of 50 nM on a surface with the same amount of immobilized IGFBP-3. Fig. 3a shows that IGF-I and IGF-II have very similar curves with fast association and slow dissociation, whereas insulin has a very low binding affinity for the binding protein. In Fig. 3b, curves for the two analogues with the C-region mutations are shown. Both analogues have almost identical kinetics, which resemble the kinetics of IGF-I, although they do display a slower association and a faster dissociation rate.In Fig. 3c are shown kinetic curves for the two analogues with B-region mutations. These mutations reduce the analogue's affinity for IGFBP-3 when compared to wild type IGF-I, by decreasing the association rate and increasing the dissociation rate. This finding is in agreement with previously published work carried out with crude acid-stable serum-binding proteins (21Bayne M.L. Applebaum J. Chicchi G.G. Hayes N.S. Green B.G. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6233-6239Google Scholar) and also with work carried out with a 4-kDa binding protein secreted from bovine kidney cells (22Szabo L. Mottershead D.G. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 207-214Google Scholar). Fig. 3d shows binding curves for the three IGF-analogues with swapped disulfide bridges. It is clear from this picture that swapping of the disulfide bridges in IGF-I greatly reduces its affinity for IGFBP-3.Data points obtained from the above-mentioned curves were used to calculate kinetic constants. This was done by fitting the binding model described earlier to the data points after correction for the bulk refractive index shift. Fig. 4 shows an example of a curve fit done on corrected data from IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin experiments. The association, dissociation, and equilibrium dissociation constants calculated from these data are presented in Table I. The analogues in the table have been grouped according to their mutations. IGF-I and IGF-II have the fastest association rate and the slowest dissociation rate of all the analogues, resulting in the highest affinities, with IGF-II having about twice the affinity of IGF-I for IGFBP-3. The calculated affinities of the other analogues are in good agreement with the degree of binding observed in the kinetic binding curves in Fig. 3.Fig. 4Association and dissociation curves for IGF-I (○), IGF-II (□), and insulin (⋄) corrected for bulk refractive index shift. A two-site binding model is fitted to the data points, as described under “Data Analysis.” The ordinate gives the measured signal in RU, representing the mass of protein bound.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IBinding parameters derived from the BIAcore experimentsPeptideka× 104± S.E.kd× 104± S.E.Kd± S.E.s−1 nM−1s−1nMIGF-I3.5 ± 0.370.78 ± 0.110.23 ± 0.04IGF-II5.2 ± 0.740.62 ± 0.0050.12 ± 0.02Insulin0.04 ± 0.0089.5 ± 2.8251 ± 914-Gly IGF-I1.8 ± 0.111.4 ± 0.150.8 ± 0.096Mini-IGF-I1.5 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.24Des (1Lowe W.L.

Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8754-8760Google Scholar). We found the equilibrium dissociation constants for IGF-I and IGF-II to be 0.23 nM and 0.12 nM, respectively, which is approximately 5 times higher than reported by Martin et al. and Sommer et al. (23Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8754-8760Google Scholar, 24Sommer A. Spratt S.K. Tatsumo G.P. Tressel T. Lee R. Maack C.A. Growth Regul. 1993; 3: 46-49Google Scholar). The discrepancy might be explained by differences in the assays used. Martin et al. (23Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8754-8760Google Scholar) used competition assays with 125I-labeled IGF, and we have found that the binding kinetics tend to be faster on the BIAcore than in solution, 3A. Heding, L. Schäffer, I. Søndergaard, P. De Meyts, and R. M. Shymko, manuscript in preparation. which might account for the difference. Sommer et al. (24Sommer A. Spratt S.K. Tatsumo G.P. Tressel T. Lee R. Maack C.A. Growth Regul. 1993; 3: 46-49Google Scholar) used the BIAcore instrument, but do not describe experimental conditions such as temperature, pH, buffer composition, immobilization level, and method of data analysis for determining kinetic constants.Human insulin was found to have a measurable, but extremely low, affinity for the binding protein-3. It has been reported that insulin is unable to bind to serum-binding proteins (16De Vroede M.A. Rechler M.M. Nissley S.P. Joshi S. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3010-3014Google Scholar, 22Szabo L. Mottershead D.G. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 207-214Google Scholar); the BIAcore assay used in this study therefore appears to be more sensitive for the detection of low affinity interactions than the competition assays used previously.The C-region mutants 4-Gly IGF-I and mini-IGF-I displayed a similar affinity for IGFBP-3, with Kd values 3 and 6 times higher than the Kd value of wild type IGF-I. Bayne et al. (17Bayne M.L. Applebaum J. Underwood D. Chicchi G.G. Green B.G. Hayes N.S. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11004-11008Google Scholar) have reported that 4-Gly IGF-I has a 2–3-fold higher affinity than IGF-I for acid-stable human serum-binding proteins and purified IGFBP-3. This slight discrepancy might be due to the different natures of the binding assays used: competition assays with 125I-labeled IGF-I as opposed to the direct binding of unlabeled ligands in the BIAcore assay. The 2-fold lower affinity of mini-IGF-I for IGFBP-3 compared with that of 4-Gly IGF-I might be explained by the complete absence of the C-region in mini-IGF-I, since this presumably causes a greater conformational change in the molecule than the replacement of the C-region residues 28–37 with a 4-glycine bridge. The relatively high affinity of these analogues for IGFBP-3 is in contrast to their affinity for the IGF-I receptor, which has been found by Bayne et al. (17Bayne M.L. Applebaum J. Underwood D. Chicchi G.G. Green B.G. Hayes N.S. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11004-11008Google Scholar) and Cascieri et al. (25Cascieri M.A. Bayne M.L. LeRoith D. Raizada M.K. Molecular and Cellular Biology of Insulin-like Growth factors and Their Receptors. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 285Google Scholar) to be approximately 30 times lower than that of the wild type molecule. Gill et al.2 found that 4-Gly IGF-I has 100 times lower affinity for the IGF-I receptor than wild type IGF-I and that mini-IGF-I has an immeasurably low receptor affinity. These results indicate that the C-region is crucial for receptor binding but is of less importance for the binding to IGFBP-3.It has been reported by several groups that amino acid 3 in the B-region of IGF-I is important for its binding to binding proteins (11Baxter R.C. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 60-65Google Scholar, 16De Vroede M.A. Rechler M.M. Nissley S.P. Joshi S. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 207-214Google Scholar, 26Forbes B. Szabo L. Baxter R.C. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 196-202Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that des(1–3) IGF-I and long IGF-I have a greatly reduced affinity for IGFBP-3, since both analogues have a mutation at amino acid 3. Both analogues are known to be more mitogenic than IGF-I in L6 myoblasts (27Ballard F.J. Francis G.L. Ross M. Bagley C.J. May B. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 398-404Google Scholar). Since des(1–3) IGF-I and a related analogue with amino acids 3 and 4 mutated to glutamine and alanine respectively have a normal affinity for the IGF-I receptor (21Bayne M.L. Applebaum J. Chicchi G.G. Hayes N.S. Green B.G. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6233-6239Google Scholar, 27Ballard F.J. Francis G.L. Ross M. Bagley C.J. May B. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 398-404Google Scholar), the increased mitogenic potency of these analogues appears to result from their low affinity for IGFBP-3 and possibly other binding proteins. Long IGF-I has half the affinity of des(1–3) IGF-I for IGFBP-3, which indicates that the 13 amino acid amino-terminal extension of long IGF-I has a disturbing effect on the binding to IGFBP-3.It is clear from the low affinities of IGF-I swap, 4-Gly IGF-I swap and mini-IGF-I swap that swapping of the disulfide bridges of IGF-I greatly impairs the hormone's ability to bind to IGFBP-3. This is primarily due to a decreased association rate. The swapped IGF-I analogues also have extremely low IGF-I receptor affinity,2 which indicates that swapping of the disulfide bridges causes a major conformational change of the entire hormone as found by Miller et al. (28Miller J.A. Narhi L.O. Hua Q.X. Rosenfeld R. Arakawa T. Rohde M. Prestrelski S. Lauren S. Stoney K.S. Tsai L. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5203-5213Google Scholar). These findings are important as IGF-I swap is secreted from recombinant organisms (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E. coli) and arises from the refolding of denatured IGF-I in quantities similar to those of the normally folded product (29Elliott S. Fagin K.D. Narhi L.O. Miller J.A. Jones M. Koski R. Peters M. Hsieh P. Sachdev R. Rosenfeld R.D. Rohde M.F. Arakawa T. J. Protein Chem. 1990; 9: 95-104Google Scholar, 30Meng H. Burleigh B.D.

Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 797-806Google Scholar).In this study we found IGFBP-3 to have a high and a low affinity binding site for the IGFs, where the high affinity binding site is responsible for approximately 90% of the binding. However, it is unclear whether the low affinity binding site has any biological relevance, since in these experiments IGFBP-3 is immobilized to the sensor chip via amine groups in a random way, and some IGFBP-3 molecules might be bound to the sensor chip close to the ligand binding site, thus impairing their affinity for the ligand.We have found that the BIAcore assay used in this study has several advantages over the classic 125I-based tracer assays. Most importantly, the BIAcore system is label-free and shows the binding of IGF-I analogues to IGFBP-3 in real time. The BIAcore system is also time saving since the system's robotic unit allows for large series of samples to be assayed automatically. Since the other five IGF-I-binding proteins are structurally related to IGFBP-3 (4Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1994; 1: 16-21Google Scholar), we believe that it should also be possible to use the assay described here for the study of interactions between these proteins and IGF-I analogues.

The peptides consist of four regions: A- and B-regions, which are homologous to the A and B chains of insulin; a C-region, which is analogous to but unrelated to the C peptide of insulin that connects the A- and B-regions; and a short carboxyl-terminal D-region, with no counterpart in insulin (2LeRoith D. Clemmons D. Nissley P. Rechler M.M. Ann. Intern. Med. 1992; 116: 854-862Google Scholar, 3Sussenbach J.S. Steenbergh P.H. Holthuizen P. Growth Regul. 1992; 2: 1-9Google Scholar).IGF-I and -II form complexes with six different IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) in the circulation and in the extracellular environment (4Martin J.L. Baxter R.C. Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes. 1994; 1: 16-21Google Scholar). In the circulation the majority of IGFs are bound in a 140-kDa complex consisting of IGFBP-3 of 40–50 kDa, an approximately 85-kDa so-called acid-labile subunit, and IGF-I or IGF-II (5Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Google Scholar, 6Kaufmann U. Zapf J. Torretti B. Froesch E.R. J. Clin.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6898-6902Google Scholar). The IGFs bind to IGFBP-3 with high affinity, and the acid-labile subunit is then capable of binding to the formed complex with a somewhat lower affinity (11Baxter R.C. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 60-65Google Scholar). The major biological function of IGFBP-3 is believed to be to extend the circulating half-lives of IGFs, since IGFs bound to the 140-kDa complex are cleared from the circulation much slower than free IGFs (12Guler H. Zapf J. Schmid C. Froesch E.R. Acta Endocrinol. 1989; 121: 753-758Google Scholar).Wild type IGFBP-3 is heavily glycosylated, which results in an apparent molecular mass of 40–50 kDa on denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, while the non-glycosylated molecule has a molecular mass of approximately 29 kDa. The non-glycosylated protein's binding characteristics are reported to be identical to those of the wild type molecule (13Tressel T.J. Tatsuno G.P. Spratt K. Sommer A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 625-633Google Scholar).Attempts have been made to identify the regions of IGF-I involved in the high affinity binding to IGFBP-3 by constructing insulin/IGF-I hybrids and by using site-directed mutagenesis of the IGF-I gene. From the studies involving insulin/IGF-I hybrids, it was established that the B-region but not the D-region of IGF-I is important for binding to IGFBP-3 (14Joshi S. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4208-4214Google Scholar, 15Joshi S. Ogawa H. Burke G.T. Tseng L.Y.-H. Rechler M.M. Katsoyannis P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

From the studies using site-directed mutagenesis, it was found that the C-region is of less importance than the B-region for high affinity binding to IGFBP-3 (17Bayne M.L. Applebaum J. Underwood D. Chicchi G.G. Green B.G. Hayes N.S. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11004-11008Google Scholar), and that residues 3 and 4, the region between residues 8 and 18, and residues 49–51 appear to be most important for IGFBP-3 binding (11Baxter R.C. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 60-65Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated the detailed association and dissociation binding kinetics between IGFBP-3 and IGF-I, IGF-II, insulin, and seven synthetic IGF-I analogues with mutations in the B- or C-regions and with normal and swapped disulfide bridges. In order to generate detailed kinetics, we have employed the BIAcore™ instrument developed by Pharmacia, and analyzed the data by using computer fitting programs developed at the Hagedorn Research Institute.The BIAcore™ technology makes it possible to visualize macromolecular interactions directly and in “real time” (18Fägerstam L.G. Frostell-Karlsson A. Karlsson R. Persson B. Ronnberg I. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 597: 397-410Google Scholar). The BIAcore is a biosensor-based instrument that uses surface plasmon resonance as the detection principle. One molecule of the interaction to be studied is immobilized covalently to a sensor chip, and the other interactant is then passed over the chip in solution. The detection system measures and displays on a computer screen a signal proportional to the mass of protein bound to the surface. In this way, the association phase can be directly visualized as the ligand-containing solution flows over the surface, and the subsequent dissociation is similarly displayed after the flow switches to buffer containing no ligand (18Fägerstam L.G. Frostell-Karlsson A. Karlsson R. Persson B. Ronnberg I. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 597: 397-410Google Scholar).The determination of the binding kinetics of IGF-I analogues toward IGFBP-3 is important for the development of IGF-I analogues with reduced affinity for IGFBP-3 and normal affinity for the IGF-I receptor, which could be of clinical interest."

The Km values of M184A RT for dNTPs were larger than those of wt RT for RNA-directed synthesis; the kcat values of M184A RT for processive or distributive synthesis were similar. In contrast to M184A RT, the Km and kcat values of M184V RT for dNTP substrates were similar to those of wt RT. The Ki values of M184V RT for 1-β-L-nucleoside analogs were increased 30-500-fold relative to wt RT for both RNA- and DNA-directed synthesis. The Kd and kp values of wt RT and M184V RT for dCTP and cis-5-fluoro-1-[2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-oxathiolan-5-yl]cytosine 5′-triphosphate (1-β-L-FTCTP) were estimated from pre-steady-state kinetics for single nucleotide incorporation. The Kd value of M184V RT for 1-β-L-FTCTP was 19-fold greater than that of wt RT; the kp values of the two enzymes were similar. These results support the hypothesis that methionine 184 in the highly conserved YMDD region of wt RT participates in the binding of the nucleoside (analog) 5′-triphosphate.

https://openalex.org/W2054373032,"Gp130 transducing protein was shown to be involved in the formation of the high affinity receptors for interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin-11 (IL-11), leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and cardiotrophin-1. In the present study we have characterized the functional properties of antibodies directed against this protein and identified a group of monoclonal antibodies able to antagonize the biological activities of all the cytokines belonging to the IL-6 cytokine family. The B-R3 pan-blocking antibody weakly interfered with the binding of the radiolabeled ligands (with the exception of OSM, whose binding was abrogated in the presence of B-R3 monoclonal antibody) but inhibited the gp130 homodimerization or its association with gp190/leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, as well as the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation events. In addition we identified antibodies that were able to neutralize only one single cytokine of the IL-6 family. This was the case for the B-K5 antibody, which antagonized the binding of OSM to gp130 but did not interfere with the signals provided by the related cytokines triggering the proliferation of the TF1 erythroleukemia cell line or the induction of haptoglobin synthesis in the HepG2 hepatoma cell line. Similarly, we also characterized two additional antibodies B-P8 and B-P4, which inhibited the TF1 cell proliferation observed in the presence of CNTF and IL-11, respectively. B-P8 antibody only faintly interfered with the binding of the gp130-ligands and might modulate the signal transduction pathways. This study indicates that in addition to functional site(s) required by the whole family of IL-6 type cytokines to transduce the signal insight the cell, specific cognate functional sites were recruited by OSM, CNTF, or IL-11.

https://openalex.org/W2121784695,"GM-95, a mutant cell line derived from mouse melanoma MEB-4 cells, is deficient in glycosphingolipids (GSLs) due to the lack of ceramide glucosyltransferase-1 activity (Ichikawa, S., Nakajo, N., Sakiyama, H., and Hirabayashi, Y. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 2703-2707). In this study, we examined the involvement of the complex sphingolipids in cell to substratum adhesion. Immunofluorescent and chemical analyses revealed that the complex sphingolipids were significantly concentrated in the detergent-insoluble substrate attachment matrix of both GM-95 and MEB-4 cells. In spite of the absence of GSLs, GM-95 cells retained the ability to adhere to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin. When both GM-95 and MEB-4 cells were treated with neutral sphingomyelinase, GM-95 cells were rounded up and detached from all ECM proteins examined. In contrast, neither the morphology nor the adherence of MEB-4 cells was altered. Under this treatment, sphingomyelin (SM) became undetectable in both cells. A similar inhibition was observed upon pretreatment of cells with fumonisin B1 or ISP-1, both of which block the synthesis of ceramide, a common precursor of both GSLs and SM. Stable transfectants expressing GSLs, which were established by transfection of glucosyltransferase-1 cDNA into GM-95 cells, became resistant to neutral sphingomyelinase-mediated rounding up and detachment from ECM proteins. In conclusion, the complex sphingolipids play critical roles in cell to substratum adhesion, and the presence of either GSLs or SM is sufficient for the adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1991329078,"α2-Macroglobulin (α2M) activated with methylamine binds to two distinct cell-surface receptors: low density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2M receptors and α2M signaling receptors. Binding to lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2M receptor but not α2M signal receptor is inhibitable by another ligand, receptor-associated protein. Direct binding studies with a recombinant receptor binding fragment (RBF) from rat α1M and murine macrophages demonstrate two classes of binding sites of apparent Kd = 90 pM (1500 sites/cell) and 40 nM (60,400 sites/cell). Receptor-associated protein competes with RBF for binding to the lower but not the higher affinity site. Site-directed mutation of Lys-1374 (human numbering) in RBF to Arg or Ile residues almost completely abolishes signal transduction as compared to wild-type RBF. Direct binding studies with K1374R demonstrated no significant alteration in binding to the lower affinity site; however, binding to the high affinity site is reduced by 83%. Mutation of Lys-1370 to Ala resulted in a 4–5-fold increase in the Kd for binding to the lower affinity site with no significant alteration in binding to the high affinity site or signal transduction properties. Studies demonstrate comparable internalization and degradation of wild-type RBF and K1374R; however, internalization and degradation of K1370A is negligible. These studies suggest that regions around Lys-1370 and Lys-1374 are involved in lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2M receptor and α2M signaling receptor binding, respectively. α2-Macroglobulin (α2M) activated with methylamine binds to two distinct cell-surface receptors: low density-lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2M receptors and α2M signaling receptors.

Putnam F.W. Plasma Proteins. Academic Press, New York1987: 191Google Scholar and 2Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 792-812Google Scholar). Reaction of α2M with proteinases causes a major conformational change in the inhibitor which physically entraps the proteinase and also exposes receptor recognition sites on each of the four identical subunits of the inhibitor. Each α2M subunit contains an internal β-cysteinyl-γ-glutamyl thiol ester which can undergo direct nucleophilic attack by methylamine or ammonia. This reaction also causes a conformational change in the inhibitor exposing the receptor recognition sites. The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2M receptor (LRP/α2MR) has been identified as an α2M receptor (for review, see 3Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-638Google Scholar). This multivalent receptor binds many ligands besides α2M-proteinase or -methylamine including receptor-associated protein (RAP), apolipoprotein E, lactoferrin, lipoprotein lipase, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, plasminogen activators alone or in complex with inhibitors, and potentially other serpin-proteinase complexes. Most of these ligands do not compete for binding with each other; however, RAP is able to block binding of all known ligands to LRP/α2MR. α2-macroglobulin low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2M receptor α2M signaling receptor cloned and expressed 20-kDa receptor binding fragment from rat α1M receptor-associated protein inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate intracellular free Ca2+ 1-[2-(5-carboxyoxazol-2-yl)-6-aminobenzofuran-5-oxyl-2-(2′-amino-5′-methylphenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester the concentration of a competing ligand which displaces 50% of the binding of a radiolabeled probe glutathione S-transferase. We have recently identified a second α2M receptor which activates a typical signaling cascade after ligation by α2M-methylamine or a cloned and expressed receptor-binding fragment (RBF) from rat α1M (4Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Google Scholar, 5Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 6Misra U.K. Chu C.T.

This receptor is coupled to a pertussis toxin-insensitive G protein and activation of this cascade causes a rapid increase in the synthesis of IP3 with a related increase in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i). Ligation of α2MSR also promotes activation of protein kinase C (8Misra U.K. Pizzo S.V. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 486-489Google Scholar) and several phospholipases, including activation and phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ1 (7Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 151-158Google Scholar). α2MSR ligation also promotes alkalinization of the cell cytoplasm (7Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 151-158Google Scholar), and these latter two effects are typical of those seen when certain growth factors, such as epidermal growth factor, bind to their respective cellular receptors. More recently, studies have shown that RBF regulates the growth of smooth muscle cells (9Webb D.J. Hussaini I.M. Weaver A.M. Atkins T.L. Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Owens G.K. Gonias S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 714-722Google Scholar). We suggest that the role of α2MSR is to sense proteolysis in the environment and initiate macrophage responses, some of which may be growth factor-like (7Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 151-158Google Scholar). Recent studies examining binding characteristics of RBF with murine macrophages have demonstrated two classes of cell surface binding sites (10Howard G.C. Misra U.K. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1193-1203Google Scholar). The higher affinity class of sites comprises approximately 4–8% of the total α2M binding sites. In the present study, we identify two similar classes of binding sites using wild-type RBF and mutant RBF ligands and show a correlation between the binding to the high and low affinity sites and signal transduction and ligand internalization and degradation, respectively. The lower affinity site demonstrates characteristics of LRP/α2MR since RAP competes for binding to this class of receptors while it fails to compete for binding to the higher affinity site, a characteristic of α2MSR. Site-directed mutagenesis together with secondary structure prediction was employed to probe regions of RBF which might be important for binding to LRP/α2MR and α2MSR. The FLAG-1/rat α1M construct, containing coding sequences for residues 1313-1451 (human numbering; residues 1336-1476 rat numbering) of the rat α1M RBF, served as a template for polymerase chain reaction (11Salvesen G. Quan L.T. Enghild J.J. Snipas S. Fey G. Pizzo S.V. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 198-202Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was amplified using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GCCGGATCCGGCGGTGAAGGAGAAGCACCC-3′ and 5′-GAGAGATCTGTCGACGAT-3′. To facilitate cloning, these primers contained restriction sites for BamHI and SalI, respectively. Following amplification, the DNA was cloned into pBluescript SK− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutagenesis was performed on the RBF using the Muta-Gene Phagemid In Vitro mutagenesis kit, version 2 (Bio-Rad). Manipulations were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions and the uracil-laden single-stranded DNA was purified using the Prep-A-Gene DNA purification kit (Bio-Rad). 24-Base oligonucleotides were used to create mutations and silent restriction sites. Mutant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5α and screened by colony polymerase chain reaction, restriction digest, and DNA sequencing using Sequenase version 2 (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Using the BamHI and SalI restriction sites, wild-type or mutant RBF was cloned into the pGEX-4T-3 expression vector (Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). Mutant RBFs are represented as follows: original amino acid/human RBF numbering/new amino acid, such as K1370A in which a lysine at residue 1370 (human RBF numbering) has been mutated to an alanine. RBF was expressed and purified by the method of Herz et al. (12Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Google Scholar) with the following modifications. DH5α bacteria containing the pGEX-4T-3/RBF construct were grown to an A600 nm of 0.6-0.8, induced with isopropylthio-β-D-galactoside at a final concentration of 1 mM, and grown for an additional 2 h at 37°C. Prior to passing the bacterial lysate through needles, DNase and MgCl2 were added to a final concentration of 20 mg/liter and 10 mM, respectively. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 40 min. Affinity chromatography was performed using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech). The RBF was cleaved from the GST-RBF fusion protein by incubating 1 mg of fusion protein with 10 units of bovine thrombin (U. S. Biochemical) in a 1-ml volume for 2 h at room temperature. Free RBF was obtained by applying the incubation mixture to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column and collecting the flow-through. Protein samples were dialyzed against 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, containing 150 mM NaCl, sterile-filtered, and stored in aliquots at −80°C. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Yields of GST-RBF fusion protein varied from 1 to 8 mg/liter of culture, with approximately 30% recovery after thrombin cleavage and repurification. The pGEX-39 kDa expression construct was the kind gift of Dr. Joachim Herz (University of Texas-Southwestern, Dallas, TX). The protein was expressed and purified as described in Herz et al. (12Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Google Scholar) with the following modifications.

After a 30-min incubation on ice, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 40 min. During the affinity chromatography step, glutathione-Sepharose 4B was substituted for glutathione-agarose. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, and dialyzed extensively against 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, containing 150 mM NaCl. Protein samples were sterile-filtered and stored in aliquots at −80°C. The GST has been cleaved from the recombinant RAP-GST product and removed from the RAP preparation. A secondary structure profile for RBF was computed from the amino acid sequence of RBF with the Profile-fed neural network system (13Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Google Scholar). 2Input to the program (the primary sequence of RBF, with program instructions) was submitted by e-mail to the internet address [email protected] Program help information can be obtained by e-mail to [email protected] The primary sequences of seven proteins in the α2-macroglobulin/complement 3–5 family were used in constructing the profile. The homologous protein domains of these molecules ranged from 31 to 62% in sequence identity to rat α1M RBF. Primary sequences used in the analysis were accessed directly from release 28.0 of the EMBL/Swiss-Prot data base by the PHD program and included (code and accession number in parentheses): murinoglobulin 1 precursor (mug1) (a2mg-mouse, P28665); murinoglobulin 2 precursor (mug2) (a2mh-mouse, P28666); α-1-inhibitor III precursor (a1i3-rat, P14046); pregnancy zone protein precursor (pzp-human, P20742); rat α-2-macroglobulin precursor (α2MG-rat, P06238); human α-2-macroglobulin precursor (α2MG-human, P01023); complement c3 precursor (co3-cavpo, P12387). Circular dichroism spectroscopy was performed on wild-type RBF in order to empirically corroborate the secondary structure prediction. The studies were performed using an AVIV 62 DS instrument at 25°C. RBF (0.16 mg/ml) in 2 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 15 mM NaCl, was studied over the wavelength range of 200 to 260 nM with 5-s averaging times. For each sample nine scans were taken. Secondary structure content was estimated with the program CONTIN (14Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 30: 33-37Google Scholar). Macrophages were obtained from C57B1/6 mice and were plated in 48-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well) and incubated for 3 h at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator. After equilibrating at 4°C, monolayers were rinsed three times with ice-cold buffer A (Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 25 mM HEPES (HHBSS) containing 12.5 units/ml penicillin, 6.5 µg/ml streptomycin, 5% bovine serum albumin). To assess nonspecific binding, some wells were rinsed three times with ice-cold buffer B (HHBSS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ containing 12.5 units/ml penicillin, 6.5 µg/ml streptomycin, 5% bovine serum albumin, 5 mM EDTA). Increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor ligands were co-incubated with 15.0 nM125I-wild-type RBF in each well and allowed to incubate at 4°C for 16–18 h. Radioligand solutions were removed from the wells, and the wells were rinsed two times in ice-cold buffer A or B. Solubilization solution was added to the wells (1.0 M NaOH, 0.1% SDS) and allowed to incubate at room temperature for ∼5 h before transferring the solution to tubes to be counted in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined by buffer B in some of the wells containing radioligands and averaged 10–15% of total binding over several assays. Specific binding equals total binding minus nonspecific binding. Percentage of total (maximal) binding achieved was determined for each concentration of unlabeled competitor and evaluated using the Sysstat® program for estimation of a Ki value. This Ki value equals 1/2 × (50% inhibitory ligand concentration or IC50) as described previously (15Roche P.A. Strickland D.K. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6715-6721Google Scholar). The term, Ki, is used because this assay examines binding to a mixed complement of receptors on the cell surface. Two or more experiments in duplicate were performed for each ligand tested. Standard errors of the mean (S.E.) for these experiments were ≤10%, and r2 values for each curve were ≥0.98. Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was determined by digital imaging microscopy in cells pre-loaded with 1-[2-(5-carboxyoxazol-1-yl)-6-aminobenzofuran-5-oxyl-2-(2′-amino-5′-methylphenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2/AM) as described in detail previously (4Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Google Scholar, 5Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophages were plated on glass coverslips sitting in 35-mm Petri dishes at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/cm2 and incubated for 16–18 h in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. Cells were removed from the incubator and 4 µM Fura-2/AM was incubated with the cells for 30 min in the dark. [Ca2+]i measurements were obtained using a digital imaging microscope. After taking baseline measurements for 5 min, ligands were added and multiple [Ca2+]i measurements were taken. Intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was determined in macrophages by digital imaging microscopy in cells pre-loaded with Fura-2/AM as described under “Screening Signaling Studies ([Ca2+]i).” After baseline measurements, ligands were added and multiple measurements were taken. A second ligand was added later in the assay in order to investigate competition between ligands for the signaling receptor. Macrophages were obtained and prepared as described under “Screening Binding Competition Assays.” Monolayers were equilibrated to 4° C and rinsed with buffers A and B as described under “Screening Binding Competition Assays.” Increasing concentrations of 125I-ligands were added to each well and allowed to incubate at 4° C for 16–18 h. Radioligand solutions were removed from the wells, which were rinsed and solubilized and counted as described under “Screening Binding Competition Assays.” Nonspecific binding averaged 10–30% of total binding over several assays. Specific binding is reported as total binding minus nonspecific binding. The competitor RAP was included in some wells along with 125I-ligands to determine which class of binding sites represents the RAP-competable site, LRP/α2MR. Scatchard analysis was used to determine the best fit to either one- or two-site binding models (based on r2 values), number of binding sites per cell, and an apparent Kd for each class of sites determined. Three or more independent experiments were used for determination of S.E. for each ligand tested. Macrophages were obtained and prepared as described under “Screening Binding Competition Assays.” Increasing concentrations of 125I-ligands were added to each well and allowed to incubate at 37°C for 2 h. Wells were rinsed two times in ice-cold buffer A or B, well solution samples were collected, and well contents were solubilized as described under “Screening Binding Competition Assays.” Nonspecific uptake averaged ≤15% of total uptake over several assays. Specific uptake is reported as total uptake minus nonspecific uptake. A 100-fold molar excess of RAP was included with the radioligand in some wells to investigate competition for internalization of the radioligand. Trichloroacetic acid (15%) and 5% bovine serum albumin were added to the well solution samples and the mixtures were centrifuged and incubated at 4°C for several hours. Aliquots were then removed for counting on a γ-counter. Nonspecific degradation averaged ≤10% of total degradation in two assays performed in triplicate. IP3 was quantified as reported by Berridge (16Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 709-724Google Scholar) and detailed for macrophages in a previous report (4Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Google Scholar). Briefly, macrophages were plated on 6-well plates (4 × 106 cells/well) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 12.5 units/ml penicillin, 6.5 µg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were allowed to adhere at 37°C for 3 h in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Media was aspirated from the monolayers and inositol-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin was added, followed by addition of 2-myo-[3H]inositol (8 µCi/ml) to each well. The cells were incubated at 37°C for an additional 16–18 h. Monolayers were rinsed three times with HHBSS containing 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM LiCl, pH 7.4, and 0.5 ml of this solution was added to each well and preincubated with the cells for 3 min at 37°C prior to stimulation with ligand for various time periods. The reaction was stopped by aspirating the medium containing the ligand and adding 6.25% perchloric acid solution. Cells were scraped and transferred to tubes containing 1 ml of octylamine:freon (1:1, v/v) and 5 mM EDTA. The tubes were centrifuged at 5600 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The upper phase solution was applied to a 1-ml Dowex resin column (AG1-X8 formate, Bio-Rad) and eluted sequentially in a batch process with H2O, and 50, 200, 400, 800, 1200, and 2000 mM ammonium formate containing 0.1 M formic acid. Aliquots were evaluated by a liquid scintillation counter. Previous studies have demonstrated two distinct macrophage binding sites for receptor-recognized forms of α-macroglobulins. Ligation of only one of these receptors, namely α2MSR, by receptor-recognized forms of α2M activates a signaling cascade, while LRP/α2MR appears to be important in uptake and degradation of α2M-proteinase complexes (9Webb D.J. Hussaini I.M. Weaver A.M. Atkins T.L. Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Owens G.K. Gonias S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 714-722Google Scholar). By virtue of this uptake function, it can also facilitate antigen presentation mediated by macrophages (17Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 48-58Google Scholar, 18Chu C.T. Oury T.D. Pizzo S.V. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1538-1545Google Scholar). The α2M receptor binding sites for both LRP/α2MR and α2MSR are located in a carboxyl-terminal region of Mr∼ 20,000 (5Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Google Scholar, 11Salvesen G. Quan L.T.

The three-dimensional structure of the RBF is unknown, and high-resolution chemical mapping studies of RBF-receptor interactions have not been reported. We have used secondary structure prediction methods to determine which residues reside in loops or on solvent-exposed surfaces of amphipathic helices and have targeted these residues for site-directed mutagenesis. The algorithm implemented in the PHD program uses a trained neural network which acts upon a primary sequence profile derived from aligned similar sequences to develop a secondary sequence prediction. In this report, secondary sequence predictions for rat RBF were made using amino acid sequences of corresponding domains of seven proteins with sequence similarity to RBF. Rost and Sander (13Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Google Scholar) report an overall three-state prediction accuracy of 72% for globular proteins. In agreement with previous analysis of native human α2M (21Welinder K.G. Mikkelsen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8328-8331Google Scholar), RBF is predicted to consist mostly of β-structure (40.8%). In addition, PHD predicts that a short segment of residues in the middle of the domain (residues 1372 to 1376, human numbering; residues 1395 to 1399, rat numbering) is helical. Circular dichroic spectra analysis also indicates that RBF is comprised of mostly β-sheet structure (37%), with a small amount of α-helix content (8%). The predicted distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues suggests that the helical segment in the middle of the domain is likely to be amphipathic. RBF could be expected to fold into a 6–8-stranded antiparallel β-sheet sandwich in which the helical segment is exposed as a surface loop connecting opposing sheets. Such a structure is likely to be a candidate receptor binding site. Residues between 1359 and 1376 (human numbering) show greater than 95% identity for sequences occurring in receptor-recognized forms of α-macroglobulins. Moreover, very few non-conservative substitutions occur in this region. Accordingly, we have designed degenerate oligonucleotide primers to introduce mutations at residues within the highly conserved, putative α-helical region and in other highly conserved regions of RBF. Binding competition assays were performed for wild-type RBF and RBF mutants and the Ki values were obtained (Table I). The Ki value obtained using this method does not differentiate between classes of binding sites; however, it does provide a gross estimate of alterations in cell surface binding of the ligand. RBF mutants found to have a significant change in this Ki value or loss of signal transduction were then further analyzed using direct binding methods which provide detailed characterization for one or more classes of binding sites. RBF mutant K1370A was found to have a Kd value of ∼1500 nM as compared to 25 nM for the wild-type RBF and was selected for more detailed characterization of binding and IP3 studies.Table I.The effect of wild-type RBF and mutant RBFs on [Ca2+]i in murine peritoneal macrophages and screening binding competition Ki valuesLigandNumber of studiesNumber of cells quantified per study[Ca2+]iScreening KiBasalaThe stimulated value represents the peak response which occurred between 1 and 2 min after exposure of macrophages to ligand in experiments which were performed at 37°C.

As a means to screen for alterations in signal transduction, [Ca2+]i studies were performed for wild-type RBF and RBF mutants (Table I). Ligands identified to have lost the ability to stimulate an increase in [Ca2+]i were then selected for studies of IP3 synthesis. Mutant RBFs K1374R and K1374I did not demonstrate a significant [Ca2+]i response. Five to 10% of the macrophages exposed to these RBF mutants show a very minimal response while 80–85% of cells show a significant response to wild-type RBF. The single cell response of macrophages exposed to wild-type RBF and mutant RBFs K1374R, K1374I, and K1370A are shown in Fig. 1. RBF mutant K1370A which shows a significantly increased Kd value in the screening binding competition assay elicits a 61% increase in [Ca2+]i (Table I), a response comparable to that obtained in other studies with wild-type RBF (5Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Google Scholar) which suggests that the interaction of RBF mutant K1370A with α2MSR is similar to that of wild-type RBF. Signaling studies were also performed to investigate cross-competition between some of the ligands. We have previously shown that exposure of macrophages to a ligand for α2MSR results in a refractory period during which time addition of a second dose of ligand for α2MSR does not result in signaling. Wild-type RBF and mutant RBF K1370A demonstrate such cross-competition for the signaling binding site (Fig. 2). Lactoferrin, a LRP/α2MR ligand which does not signal through α2MSR but through LRP/α2MR (6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Google Scholar), fails to show cross-competition with mutant RBF K1370A for binding to a signaling receptor site.Fig. 2Single cell response of macrophages exposed to sequential ligands.

Wild-type RBF displays binding to two distinct sites, one class having 1,500 sites/cell with an apparent Kd of 90 pM and the other site having 60,400 sites/cell with an apparent Kd of 40 nM. Only binding to the lower affinity site is competable by RAP. The Kd of 40 nM for the lower affinity site is consistent with published values for cloned and expressed RBF binding to cells (20 nM) (11Salvesen G. Quan L.T. Enghild J.J. Snipas S. Fey G. Pizzo S.V. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 198-202Google Scholar, 19Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Roche P.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1406-1412Google Scholar, 22Van Leuven F. Marynen P. Sottrup-Jensen L.

It is possible that the data determined by Scatchard analysis to fit a two-site model may actually represent a complicated one-site model, such as dimerization of receptors by a multivalent ligand as in the case of human α2M which may create a high affinity component, or negative cooperativity of binding to a receptor which may create a low affinity component. Neither of these explanations seems likely given the use of a monomeric ligand and the selective inhibition of only one binding site by the competitor RAP. K1374R mutant RBF demonstrates comparable binding to lower affinity sites; however, binding to high affinity sites is reduced by 83%. Mutation of Lys-1370 to Ala results in an increase in the apparent Kd to the lower affinity site from 40 to 150–200 nM, while binding to the high affinity site is unaltered. This decreased affinity for the low affinity site makes the K1370A mutant RBF a poor competitor against wild-type RBF for binding to cells (Table I), with only 2–3% of cell surface α2M receptors being the high affinity class, to which the K1370A mutant RBF still binds comparably to wild-type RBF. Studies completed with E1431A mutant RBF show that no apparent alterations result in either binding assay or the signal transduction assay from this mutation. Two classes of binding sites are identified with similar characteristics as the wild-type RBF binding sites: apparent Kd values = 40 pM (1100 receptors/cell) and 10 nM (40,500 receptors/cell).Fig. 4Direct binding of wild-type125I-K1374R mutant RBF to macrophages at 4°C in the absence or presence of 100-fold molar excess RAP.

Internalization is comparable for wild-type RBF, K1374R, and E1431A mutant RBFs and is RAP-inhibitable. Internalization and degradation of K1370A mutant RBF, however, is negligible as compared to wild-type RBF, and K1374R and E1431A mutant RBFs. Effects of wild-type RBF and mutant RBFs on the generation of IP3 by macrophages was studied (Fig. 7). Binding of wild-type RBF induces synthesis of IP3 as previously reported (4Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Google Scholar, 5Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Google Scholar). However, neither K1374R nor K1374I mutant RBF induce any increase in IP3 synthesis. Consistent with these results, while wild-type RBF induces an increase in [Ca2+]i, neither of the two mutant RBF's elicit a significant increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 1). Table II summarizes the IP3 response data. The only information known concerning the interaction of RBF with α2MSR is that RAP does not affect its binding (5Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18303-18306Google Scholar). By contrast, RAP does block the binding of RBF to LRP/α2MR (5Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar, 20Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14011-14017Google Scholar). The data presented in this study indicate that mutation of K1374 affects binding of RBF to α2MSR while not altering binding to LRP/α2MR significantly. This suggests that K1374 is part of the ligand binding site for α2MSR. It is possible that mutation in this region disrupts tertiary structure, however, gross alteration of tertiary structure is unlikely since mutant RBFs can still bind LRP/α2MR, with a decreased affinity only in the case of RBF mutant K1370A. It is known that interaction of RBF with LRP/α2MR is very dependent on conformation (23Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. Van Leuven F. FEBS Lett. 1986; 205: 20-24Google Scholar). In addition, mutant RBFs were expressed and purified as effectively as the wild-type RBF. Mutations were also introduced into a second highly conserved sequence in RBF (residues 1424 and 1435; human numbering) (19Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Roche P.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1406-1412Google Scholar). These mutants signaled comparably to wild-type RBF with none showing decreased binding to LRP/α2MR (Table II), and further studies of E1431A mutant RBF show no alteration in binding to either site as compared to wild-type RBF. Lys-1370, which is predicted to be in a loop immediately upstream of the helix containing Lys-1374, is conserved in all receptor-binding α-macroglobulins (19Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Roche P.A. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1406-1412Google Scholar). In frog α-macroglobulin, which does not bind to macrophages (24Rubenstein D.S. Thogersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 85-95Google Scholar), this residue is an alanine. 3In collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Jan Enghild, we have cloned this frog α-macroglobulin. The sequence is as yet unpublished. Interestingly, mutation of Lys-1370 to alanine in the rat protein results in a significantly increased Ki for binding to macrophages (Ki = 1500 nM) (Table I). Macrophages exposed to this mutant show augmented IP3 synthesis (Fig. 7B) and [Ca2+]i increases like those of wild-type RBF (Fig. 1, Table II). Initial estimates suggested that as many as 20% of α2M receptors on macrophages are α2MSR (5Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Google Scholar). The more detailed binding studies presented in this report suggest that less than 5% of the total receptors on macrophages are α2MSR (10Howard G.C. Misra U.K. DeCamp D.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1193-1203Google Scholar), agreeing with studies of rat vascular smooth muscle cells (less than 3–5%) (9Webb D.J. Hussaini I.M. Weaver A.M. Atkins T.L. Chu C.T. Pizzo S.V. Owens G.K. Gonias S.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 714-722Google Scholar). An analogy to this situation may be that of thrombin-binding sites on platelets, where high affinity binding sites for thrombin are estimated to comprise 20–50 sites/platelet out of a total of 85,000-591,000 thrombin binding sites/platelet (25Harmon J.T. Jamieson G.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 58-64Google Scholar, 26Harmon J.T. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15928-15933Google Scholar). This extremely low percentage of sites is within the error of typical binding competition or displacement assays, and it appears that the percentage of α2M cellular receptors which are α2MSR is similarly well within the 5–10% error of these assays. Based on these observations and the fact that the K1370A mutation resulted in an increase in Kd of about 5–10-fold without significant loss of signal transduction properties, we hypothesize that this observed decrease in receptor affinity is to LRP/α2MR.

These genes are selectively activated when insects become infected with bacteria or their body wall is injured. The Rel family of transcription factors, such as NF-κB, may participate in the activation of these defense protein genes (9Sun S.C. Lindstrom I. Lee J.-Y. Faye I. Eur. J.

All of these proteins were originally isolated and characterized from larval hemolymph.Recently, Bulet et al. (19Bulet P. Dimarcq J.-L. Hetru C. Lagueux M. Charlet M. Hegy G. Van Dorsselaer A.

This peptide is unique in carrying an O-glycosylated threonine residue, and the saccharide chain (consisting of an N-acetylgalactosamine plus a glucose) was found to be essential for the molecule's antibacterial activity. We are interested in the structure of the saccharide chain of the Sarcophaga counterpart to drosocin and have tried to isolate it from adult Sarcophaga. So far we have not succeeded in isolating a drosocin-like substance from Sarcophaga, but we have found a novel antimicrobial substance the structure of which we determined to be N-β-alanyl-5-S-glutathionyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (5-S-GAD). 1The abbreviations used are: 5-S-GADN-β-alanyl-5-S-glutathionyl-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyGSHglutathioneHSQCheteronuclear single-quantum correlationDQF-COSYdouble quantum-filtered correlated spectroscopyHOHAHAhomonuclear Hartman-Hahn spectroscopyHMBCheteronuclear multiple-bond correlationESCAelectron spectroscopy chemical analysis. This paper reports the isolation, structural determination, enzymatic synthesis, and mode of action of 5-S-GAD.DISCUSSIONWe reported the isolation, structural determination, and mode of action of a novel antibacterial substance from Sarcophaga, named 5-S-GAD, which is a conjugate of GSH and β-Ala-Dopa. This insect is known to contain large amounts of β-Ala-Tyr (sarcophagine) (21Bodnaryk R.P. Levenbook L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1969; 30: 909-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, the β-Ala-Dopa in 5-S-GAD is presumably derived from β-Ala-Tyr. As 5-S-GAD was synthesized from GSH and β-Ala-Dopa via the action of mushroom tyrosinase, which is a phenoloxidase, a similar reaction probably occurs in the insect, which has a potent phenoloxidase.We purified 5-S-GAD from whole bodies of immunized adult Sarcophaga, so we do not know where 5-S-GAD is synthesized. Previously, we reported that the GSH levels in the fat bodies of Sarcophaga larvae transiently decrease by about 30% when the larval body wall is injured (22Sugiyama H. Natori S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 1171-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This is a rapid response which occurs within 30 min of the injury. Although we have not identified 5-S-GAD in immunized larvae, we assume that the situation is the same between adults and larvae, and that 5-S-GAD is probably synthesized by the fat body, hemocytes, or both. The fat body and hemocytes of Sarcophaga larvae are known to synthesize various defense proteins (23Takahashi H. Komano H. Natori S. J. Insect Physiol. 1986; 32: 771-779Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Matsumoto N. Okada M. Takahashi H. Qu X.-M. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi Y. Komano H. Natori S. Biochem.

Chem. 1988; 263: 17117-17121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known if 5-S-GAD is secreted into the hemolymph, but in mammalian cells many GSH conjugates are released from the cells via a GS-X pump (27Ishikawa T. Tew K.D. Pickett C.B. Mantle T.J. Mannervik B. Hayes J.D. Structure and Function of Glutathione S-Transferase. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 211Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that 5-S-GAD is synthesized in the fat body and/or hemocytes, is released into the hemolymph and suppress bacterial infection.Mechanism of formation of H2O2 from 5-S-GAD is not clear. Although 5-S-GAD is thought to release H2O2 readily, we cannot exclude the possibility that a specific bacterial oxidase (possibly a terminal oxidase of the respiratory chain) participates in this process in combination with 5-S-GAD.Finally, we would like to point out the possibility that 5-S-GAD activates a Rel family transcription factor, as well as being an antibacterial substance. As H2O2 is thought to be easily produced from 5-S-GAD in the fat body and/or hemocytes, it is possible that the resulting H2O2 activates a Rel family transcription factor, such as NF-κB, in situ resulting in the activation of various antibacterial protein genes. In fact, Sun and Faye (28Sun S.C. Faye I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have reported that the transcription of immune-protein genes in the fat body of Hyalophora cecropia is augmented by H2O2. In mammals, H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species function as intracellular signals leading to the activation of NF-κB (29Meyer M. Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 91: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Thus, 5-S-GAD may be a key molecule of the insect defense system; in which case, when Sarcophaga was infected with bacteria, 5-S-GAD would be rapidly synthesized and would suppress bacterial growth as the primary response of the insect, while the genes for various antibacterial proteins would subsequently be activated in response to H2O2 produced by 5-S-GAD. This is a novel hypothesis of insect immunity and many more experiments are needed to test it.

Finally, we studied the effects of 6-nitronorepinephrine on NE release from PVN neurons in vivo. We purchased 100 porcine brains (150-200 g/brain) from Tokyo Shibaura Zoki (Tokyo, Japan). Catechol derivatives were extracted from the brain tissues by a previously described method (7Nakadate T. Kubota K. Muraki T. Kato R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1980; 64: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar).

A peak with a retention time identical to that of the 6-nitronorepinephrine synthesized in vitro was obtained. The fractions were pooled and subjected to the following analyses by UV spectrometry, mass spectrometry (MS), and NMR spectroscopy. Absorbance was measured at a wavelength between 190 and 500 nm using a UV photometer (Waters 990; Waters Japan). The mobile phase was a water solution that consisted of 5.5 mM formate and 6.7 mM ammonium formate (pH 3.7), and a strong cation exchange column (Whatman Japan, Tokyo, Japan) was used for sample separation at 25°C. Before the following analyses, further purification was performed with a C18 reverse phase column (Whatman Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and a mobile phase of 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v in water) and 0.07% acetonitrile (v/v in water). Mass spectral analysis was carried out on a JMS-SX/SX102A (BEBE configuration) tandem mass spectrometer (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Positive and negative ion fast atom bombardment MS, employing 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol as the matrix, produced [M + H]+ ions at m/z 215.0669 (calculated for C8H11N2O5, 215.0668) and [M − H]− ions at m/z 213. Collisionally activated dissociation was performed with argon as the collision gas at a pressure sufficient to reduce the precursor ion signal by 80%. The accelerating voltage was 10 kV and the collision cell potential was set at 5 kV. The 1H NMR spectrum was recorded on a JEOL GX-400 NMR spectrometer (JEOL), using tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. Groups of four male Sprague-Dawley rats (Sankyo Laboservice, Tokyo, Japan) were given both 200 mg/kg of either NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or NG-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester (D-NAME) and 800 mg/kg of L- or D-arginine hydrochloride intraperitoneally at 60 min before decapitation under ether anesthesia. The drugs were dissolved in saline, and the solution was adjusted to pH 7.4 before use. The brain contents of 6-nitronorepinephrine were then extracted by the method described above. The peak areas of samples were compared with those of the standard 6-nitronorepinephrine determined for quantification. All experiments conformed to the standards put forth in the Handbook for the Use of Animals in Neuroscience Research. Uptake of L-[3H]NE into synaptosomes was measured by a previously described method (9Richelson E. Pfenning M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 104: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In brief, male Sprague-Dawley rats were decapitated, followed by immediate dissection of the brain to remove the frontal cortex (~600 mg) according to the method of Glowinski and Iversen (10Glowinski J. Iversen L.L. J. Neurochem. 1966; 13: 655-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (5023) Google Scholar). The tissue was homogenized in 20 volumes of ice-cold 0.3 M sucrose containing 11 mM glucose, pH 7.4, at 37°C (buffer 1) in a glass homogenizer with a Teflon pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g in a refrigerated centrifuge to obtain a crude nuclear fraction. The pellet was discarded and the supernatant was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded and the crude synaptosomal pellet was resuspended in 20 volumes of buffer 1. Preparation of the crude synaptosomal suspension was performed at 4°C. The transport of 8 nML-[3H]NE (DuPont NEN) into cortical synaptosomes was measured in the presence of various concentrations of 6-nitronorepinephrine and related compounds to determine the rank order of potency for the blockade of monoamine uptake. Aliquots of the synaptosomal suspension (50 µl) were added to tubes containing 50 µl of the test drug and 350 µl of a modified Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (122 mM NaCl, 4.8 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, and 15.8 mM Na2HPO4) containing 2.0 mg/ml glucose, 0.2 mg/ml ascorbic acid, and 12.5 µM nialamide (buffer 2). After a 5-min preincubation at 37°C in a shaking water bath (80 oscillations/min), the uptake was initiated by the addition of 50 µl of the radiolabeled monoamine. This transport was stopped after 5 min by adding 4.5 ml of ice-cold 0.9% NaCl (buffer 3) and immediately filtering through Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters under a vacuum. The tubes were rinsed three times with 5 ml of buffer 3, and the rinses were then applied to the filters. Filters were removed and placed in plastic scintillation vials containing 4 ml of scintillator, and the radioactivity was measured after a minimum of 8 h by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Nonspecific transport was determined to be the amount of uptake in the presence of 10 µM imipramine for NE transport. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Surgery and the microdialysis experiments were performed according to the previously described methods (11Shintani F. Nakaki T. Kanba S. Sato K. Yagi G. Shiozawa M. Aiso S. Kato R. Asai M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1961-1970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (7-8 weeks of age) were used. A microdialysis probe was inserted into the left PVN (1.5 mm posterior to the bregma, 0.6 mm lateral to the midline, and 7.0 mm below the skull surface, according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (12Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986Google Scholar)). Under nonanesthetized and freely moving conditions, Hanks' solution (137 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgSO4, 0.338 mM Na2HPO4, 0.4 mM KH2PO4, 5.6 mM glucose, 4.2 mM NaHCO3, pH 7.4) was perfused into the probe at a flow rate of 1.5 µl/min for 3 h to allow equilibration. The dialysate was collected at 20-min intervals into microtubes (Eicom) containing 70 µl of acetate/water solution (0.02 mM). The microtubes were maintained at 4°C to prevent oxidation of catechol compounds. To examine the effects of 6-nitronorepinephrine, Hanks' solution containing 100 µM 6-nitronorepinephrine was perfused into the microdialysis probe without stopping the aforementioned sampling; perfusion was continued for up to 60 min. To examine the effects of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor on NE and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) levels in PVN dialysates, 200 mg/kg L-NAME combined with 800 mg/kg D-arginine hydrochloride or the same amount of L-NAME combined with equivalent doses of L-arginine hydrochloride were administered intraperitoneally. Each dialysis sample was immediately injected into an HPLC system to allow measurement of the levels of NE and MHPG by a previously described method (8Shintani F. Kanba S. Nakaki T. Nibuya M. Kinoshita N. Suzuki E. Yagi G. Kato R. Asai M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3574-3581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All drugs were freshly prepared and adjusted to pH 7.4 on the day of use. The rats were given free access to food and water throughout the microdialysis procedure. The HPLC-ECD system was set up based on a previously described method (8Shintani F. Kanba S. Nakaki T. Nibuya M. Kinoshita N. Suzuki E. Yagi G. Kato R. Asai M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3574-3581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, the chromatographic system consisted of a dual plunger pump (EP-10, Eicom), an electrochemical detector with a carbon-graphite electrode (Coulochem II, ESA), an autosampling injector (231-401, Gilson Medical Electronics Inc.) with a 100-µl loop, and an ODS column. We used a CA-5ODS column (150 × 4.6 mm, inner diameter; Eicom); the mobile phase consisted of 95% 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (0.0862 M NaH2PO4·2H2O and 0.0138 M Na2HPO4·12H2O; pH 6.0), 2% methanol, 200 mg/liter sodium 1-octanesulfonate, and 50 mg/liter EDTA·2Na. The buffer was sonicated to degas before use. Separation was achieved at 25°C using a flow rate of 1 ml/min. An electrochemical detector with a carbon-graphite working electrode was set at 400 mV for the guard cell, at 50 mV for the oxidation electrode, and at −200 to −300 mV for the reduction electrode. Data were recorded on an integrator (Chromatocorder 12, JASCO, Tokyo, Japan), and peak heights/area of dialysis samples were compared with those of standards determined each day for quantitation. The detection limit was 0.5 pg/100 µl. Several concentrations of 6-nitronorepinephrine were incubated in a receptor binding preparation containing [3H]prazosin (1.10 TBq/mmol, DuPont NEN) (13Richelson E. Nelson A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 103: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), [3H]yohimbine (2.59 TBq/mmol, DuPont NEN) (13Richelson E. Nelson A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 103: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), or [3H]CGP12177 (1.11 TBq/mmol, DuPont NEN) (14Porzig H. Becker C. Reuter H. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmakol. 1982; 321: 89-99Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the α1, α2, and nonselective β-adrenergic receptor ligands, respectively. COMT activity was determined by measuring the amount of normetanephrine formed from NE (15Axelrod J. Tomchick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 702-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation mixture consisted of the following components in a total volume of 0.5 ml: 0.1 ml of 0.5 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 0.05 ml of 100 mM MgCl2, 0.1 ml of 10 mM S-adenosylmethionine (Sigma), 0.01 ml of 15 mML-NE hydrochloride (Sigma), 0.14 ml of several concentrations of 6-nitronorepinephrine, and 20 units of COMT (Sigma) dissolved in 0.1 ml of the buffer containing 10 mM dithiothreitol. The mixture was incubated for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 µl of 4 M perchloric acid. Protein was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was injected into the HPLC system set up as described above. Peak areas were compared with those of the standard normetanephrine (Sigma) determined for quantification. Monoamine oxidase activity was determined with serotonin or L-NE serving as a substrate based on a previously described method (16Wurtman R.J. Axelrod J.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1963; 12: 1439-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Levels of monoamines were determined by using the HPLC system. The 6-nitronorepinephrine used in these experiments was synthesized in vitro from L-NE and NO·. After 10 mg of L-NE hydrochloride had been dissolved in 100 ml of distilled water, 200-300 ml of NO· gas were bubbled in a gas-tight glass tube at 37°C at atmospheric pressure for 2 min. The reaction products were separated and purified with the HPLC system described above. The structure was confirmed using both MS and NMR spectroscopy (data not shown). The purity of 6-nitronorepinephrine exceeded 95%. Catechol-containing molecules were extracted from porcine brain tissue and separated by HPLC with ECD (Fig. 1A). The presence of 6-nitronorepinephrine was then detected in porcine brain using a UV detection method (Fig. 1B), MS (Fig. 1C), and NMR spectroscopy (Fig. 1D). The concentration of this catecholamine in pig brain was 75 ± 7 pg/g. The average rat brain concentration was 78 ± 8 pg/g (data not shown). The 6-nitronorepinephrine content of the whole brain constitutes about 0.01% of total NE. Next, we tested whether nitric oxide synthase is involved in the formation of 6-nitronorepinephrine in the brain. 6-Nitronorepinephrine levels, as measured by HPLC-ECD in rat brains minus the olfactory bulbs, fell following intraperitoneal injection of L-NAME (200 mg/kg), but not D-NAME (Fig. 2). This decrease was reversed by coadministration of 800 mg/kg of L-arginine hydrochloride, but not D-isomer drug (Fig. 2). These results suggest that nitric oxide synthase is involved in the formation of 6-nitronorepinephrine. Ischiropoulos et al. (18Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. Chen J. Tsai M. Martin J.C. Smith C.D. Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar) showed that peroxynitrite and Cu2+ mediate nitration of the electrophilic center of the phenyl moiety of tyrosine. Although the nitration of NE may be mediated through peroxynitrite, the mechanisms governing nitration of 6-nitronorepinephrine in vivo remain to be determined. We then examined whether 6-nitronorepinephrine exerts biological effects. Subsequent to identifying 6-nitronorepinephrine in the brain, we became aware of reports describing the in vitro synthesis of 6-nitronorepinephrine (5Ischia M. Costantini C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 6de la Bretèche M.L. Servy C. Lenfant M. Ducrocq C. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 35: 7231-7232Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The authors of these reports did not, however, explore any potential biological actions of this compound. We found that at up to 100 µM this catecholamine did not displace the binding of [3H]prazosin, [3H]yohimbine, or [3H]CGP12177, the α1, α2, and nonselective β-adrenergic receptor ligands, respectively (data not shown). Likewise, the activity of monoamine oxidase was unaffected (data not shown). However, transport of 8 nML-[3H]NE into rat brain synaptosomes prepared from frontal and occipital cortices was inhibited by 6-nitronorepinephrine at concentrations higher than 1 µM (Fig. 3A). The concentration of 6-nitronorepinephrine at 50% maximal transport (IC50) was 31 µM, approximately 6 times less potent than the antidepressant bupropion (IC50, 5 µM (9Richelson E. Pfenning M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1984; 104: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar)). 6-Nitronorepinephrine inhibited the activity of COMT with an IC50 of 7.5 µM (Fig. 3B), suggesting that this catecholamine may act as a COMT inhibitor. 3,4-Dihydroxy-5-nitrobenzene derivatives, such as entacapone, have been synthesized as selective COMT inhibitors (19Nissinen E. Linden I.B. Schultz E. Pohto P. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmakol. 1992; 346: 262-266Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). 6-Nitronorepinephrine is, however, much less potent than entacapone (IC50, 10 nM (20Mannisto P.T. Kaakkola S. Nissinen E. Linden I.B. Pohto P. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 1465-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Kaakkola S. Gordin A. Mannisto P.T. Gen. Pharmacol. 1994; 25: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)). Since substitutions at position 1 of the phenyl moiety determine the potency of COMT inhibitors (20Mannisto P.T. Kaakkola S. Nissinen E. Linden I.B. Pohto P. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 1465-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it is possible that 6-nitrocatechols with side chains similar to those of entacapone would be more potent COMT inhibitors than 6-nitronorepinephrine. To examine the effects of 6-nitronorepinephrine on central noradrenergic neurotransmission in vivo, we conducted a microdialysis experiment to determine the contents of NE and MHPG in the rat PVN, where both nitric oxide synthase-containing neurons and noradrenergic neurons exist (3Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (2667) Google Scholar). Significant elevations of NE and decreases in MHPG were observed during the perfusion of 6-nitronorepinephrine, and both were dose-dependent (Fig. 4). The inhibition by 6-nitronorepinephrine of both COMT activities and the reuptake of NE into presynaptic neurons may account for the above results. In addition, intraperitoneal administration of L-NAME to rats resulted in decreased NE as well as increased MHPG in PVN dialysates (Fig. 5). These changes were reversed by coadministration of L-arginine (Fig. 5). Two explanations are possible for the results of L-NAME. (a) NO· by itself facilitates neurotransmitter release (22Ma S. Long J.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 199: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Lonart G. Wang J. Johnson K.M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 220: 271-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 24Hanbauer I. Wink D. Osawa Y. Edelman G.M. Gally J.A. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 409-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and NO· inhibits catecholamine reuptake to synaptosome (25Gronberg M. Terland O. Husebye E.S. Glatmark T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); and (b) the inhibition of nitric oxide synthase activity might diminish the amounts of endogenous 6-nitronorepinephrine in the PVN, which inhibited NE reuptake and COMT activities in vivo. Nitric oxide synthase-containing and NE-containing neurons coexist in both the locus coeruleus (26Xu Z.Q. Pieribone V.A. Zhang X. Grillner S. Hökfelt T. Exp. Brain Res. 1994; 98: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and the PVN (3Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1990; 347: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (2667) Google Scholar), but the two are apparently never found in a single neuron (26Xu Z.Q. Pieribone V.A. Zhang X. Grillner S. Hökfelt T. Exp. Brain Res. 1994; 98: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This suggests that 6-nitronorepinephrine may be synthesized via an interaction between NE and NO· released from different neurons. Therefore, it is still an open question whether endogenous concentrations of 6-nitronorepinephrine inhibits catecholamine reuptake and COMT activities. Our results suggest that NO· reacts with NE in vivo, and that the resultant 6-nitronorepinephrine has distinct biological activities that modulate synaptic transmissions."

These proteins physically associate to form a complex (DNA·PK) with DNA-dependent protein kinase activity. In this study, we demonstrate using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) that the nuclear DNA end-binding activity of Ku is altered in the human promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cell line. Western blot and EMSA supershift analyses revealed that HL-60 cells expressed both full-length and variant Ku86 proteins. However, a combined EMSA and immunoanalysis revealed that the Ku heterodimers complexed with DNA in HL-60 cells contained only the variant Ku86 proteins. Finally, UV cross-linking experiments and DNA·PK assays demonstrated that the Ku complexes containing variant Ku86 had a greatly reduced ability to interact with DNA-PKcs and that consequently HL-60 cells had severely diminished DNA·PK activity. These data provide important insights into the interaction between Ku and DNA-PKcs and into the role of DNA·PK in DNA double-strand break repair.

In particular, DNA DSBs appear to be the predominant cytotoxic lesions as even a single unrepaired DNA DSB can be a lethal event (3Klar A.J.S. Strathern J.N. Abraham J.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp.

IR-sensitive (IRs) mutants have been isolated from hamster ovary (CHO) or lung (V79) cell lines, and in approximately half of these cell lines, IR sensitivity correlated with a greatly decreased ability to repair DNA DSBs (reviewed in 5Zdzienicka M.Z.

Lymphoid V(D)J recombination is a site-specific reaction that involves the assembly of noncontiguous genomic segments that encode the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) elements of immunoglobulin and T cell-receptor genes (for a recent review, see 6Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Google Scholar). Elegant analyses of V(D)J recombination products in vivo and in vitro strongly suggests that DNA DSBs are an essential intermediate in the V(D)J reaction mechanism (7Roth D.B. Nakajima P.B. Menetski J.P. Bosma M.J. Gellert M. Cell. 1992; 69: 41-53Google Scholar, 8Roth D.B. Menetski J.P. Nakajima P.B. Bosma M.J. Gellert M. Cell. 1992; 70: 983-991Google Scholar, 9Schlissel M.

Thus, it is plausible that DNA DSB repair and mammalian V(D)J recombination may share some common factors. Consistent with this hypothesis, mutants have been identified that have defects in both pathways. Mice homozygous for the murine severe combined immune deficiency (scid) mutation, exhibit a profound immune deficiency in vivo, that is caused by a defect in V(D)J recombination coding junction formation, and they are also severely IRs due to a DNA DSB repair defect (reviewed in 6Lewis S.M.

In addition, several Chinese hamster IRs mutants (V3, xrs-6, XR-1, sxi-1, sxi-2, sxi-3, and sxi-4) that are impaired in DSB repair were also shown to be defective for V(D)J recombination (14Taccioli G.E.

Therefore, the genes defective in these mutant cell lines are strong candidates to encode factors which are involved both in DNA DSB repair and V(D)J recombination. While the exact enzymology of mammalian DNA DSB repair is still unknown, a complex, which has DNA-dependent serine-threonine protein kinase activity (DNA·PK) (20Carter T. Vancurova I. Sun I. Lou W.

Ku is thus thought to provide the DNA binding component for the DNA·PK holoenzyme. Recently, it was shown that members of the fifth x-ray cross-complementation group (XRCC5) (5Zdzienicka M.Z. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 203-213Google Scholar, 41Thompson L.H. Jeggo P.A. Mutat. Res. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), which are very IRs and DNA DSB repair-defective, lack Ku DNA end-binding activity (19He D.M. Lee S.E. Hendrickson E.A. Mutat.

Plet A. Imbert J. Lafage-Pochitaloff M. Cerdan C. Blanchard J.M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1994; 65: 221-227Google Scholar) and XRCC5 group cells could be rescued by the same region (46Jeggo P.A. Hafezparast M. Thompson A.F. Broughton B.C. Kaur G.P. Zdzienicka M.Z. Athwal R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6423-6427Google Scholar), Ku86 was a strong candidate for the XRCC5 gene. Consistent with this hypothesis, several groups independently reported that transfection of a Ku86 cDNA was able to rescue the defects of XRCC5 mutants (18Boubnov N.V. Hall K.T. Wills Z. Lee S.E. He D.M. Benjamin D.M. Pulaski C.R. Band H. Reeves W. Hendrickson E.A. Weaver D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 890-894Google Scholar, 19He D.M. Lee S.E. Hendrickson E.A. Mutat.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1519-1526Google Scholar), and molecular defects in the Ku86 gene in a XRCC5 group cell line have been identified (49Errami A. Smider V. Rathmell W.K. He D.M. Hendrickson E.A. Zdzienicka M.Z. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1519-1526Google Scholar). Thus, DNA·PK has been unequivocally identified as an important mammalian DNA repair complex and mutations in either the DNA-PKcs or the 86-kDa subunit of Ku result in severe IRs and V(D)J recombination and DNA DSB repair defects. We have recently demonstrated that the human promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cell line was IRs, but DNA DSB repair-proficient (50Han Z. Chatterjee D. He D.M. Early J. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5849-5857Google Scholar) and thus, in this latter regard, differed significantly from scid or XRCC5 mutant cell lines. In this study, we demonstrate that the nuclear DNA-binding activity of Ku is altered in HL-60 cells. Using monoclonal antibodies directed against various epitopes of the Ku proteins, we demonstrate that, although HL-60 cells expressed both a full-length and a variant truncated version of Ku86, only the heterodimer of Ku70-variant Ku86 was complexed with DNA. This altered Ku complex had a greatly reduced ability to interact with DNA-PKcs and this resulted in severely diminished DNA·PK activity. These data provide important insights into the interaction between Ku and DNA-PKcs and into the role of DNA·PK in DNA double-strand break repair. DNase I and RPMI 1640 medium were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibodies directed against human Ku70 (mAb N3H10), Ku86 (mAbs 111, N9C1, and S10B1), Ku70:86 heterodimers (mAb 162), and DNA-PKcs (mAb 42–27) have been described before (20Carter T.

[α-32P]dATP, [γ-32P]rCTP, and [γ-32P]rATP were purchased from DuPont NEN. HL-60 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Isolation of the HCW-2 cell mutant from HL-60 cells has been described (54Han Z. Chatterjee D. Early J. Pantazis P. Hendrickson E.A. Wyche J.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1621-1628Google Scholar). All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (20% for HL-60 and 10% for HCW-2 cells), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin. Cell cultures were kept in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed in 10 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.25% Nonidet P-40) on ice, and then briefly vortexed. The lysate was layered on top of 30 ml of ice-cold sucrose buffer (buffer A with 0.25 M sucrose) in a 50-ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1500 relative centrifugal force in an MSE MISTRAL 3000i centrifuge at 4°C for 5 min. The supernatant was removed by aspiration. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer A, and the nuclei were purified through sucrose medium twice. Nuclei were then lysed in NaCl extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min. An equal volume of 0.5 M NaCl, 18% polyethylene glycol 8000 buffer was mixed with the lysate, and the incubation continued for another 10 min. The lysate was then centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The clarified supernatant was used as the native nuclear extract. To prepare cytoplasmic extract, cells were lysed in lysis buffer A in the presence of 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was immediately centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The clarified supernatant was used as native cytoplasmic extract. Protein content in the extract was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagents. Aliquots of the extract was stored at −85°C. EcoRI and XbaI DNA fragments (∼250 bp) were end-labeled with Klenow DNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. To prepare the double-stranded 25-mer DNA, two oligonucleotides (5′-ACTTGATTAGTTACGTAACGTTATG-3′ and 5′-CATAACGTTACGTAACTAATCAAGT-3′) were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and subsequently annealed together. All radiolabeled fragments were electrophoresed through 5% polyacrylamide gels and subsequently purified. A gel mobility shift assay for the determination of Ku DNA end binding activity was adapted for this study (18Boubnov N.V. Hall K.T. Wills Z. Lee S.E. He D.M. Benjamin D.M. Pulaski C.R. Band H. Reeves W. Hendrickson E.A. Weaver D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 890-894Google Scholar, 19He D.M. Lee S.E. Hendrickson E.A. Mutat. Res. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Briefly, radiolabeled DNA (4 ng, 100,000 cpm) was incubated with nuclear or cytoplasmic extract in 15 µl of binding buffer (10 mM Tric-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 200 mM NaCl, 1 µg of circular plasmid pRSV-neo DNA) on ice for 5 min. The samples were electrophoresed in a 5% polyacrylamide gel at room temperature for 3 h at 130 V. The gel was dried on Whatman 3M paper and exposed to Fuji x-ray films at −85°C. In the supershift experiments, monoclonal antibodies (1 µl of ascites preparations) were added to the binding mixture following the 5-min incubation on ice and incubated for an additional 10 min prior to gel electrophoresis. A radiolabeled ∼150-bp DNA fragment (4 ng, 100,000 cpm) and nuclear extracts (3 µg) were incubated on ice for 5 min as described except that the circular plasmid pRSV-neo DNA was omitted. Then, 5 µl of DNase I solutions (containing various amounts of DNase I and 30 mM MgCl2 and 30 mM CaCl2) were added, and the mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 3 min. The samples were immediately subjected to electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel under the conditions described for the gel mobility shift assay. The gel was subsequently dried on Whatman 3M paper and exposed to x-ray film. For the immunoblot detection of Ku70 and Ku86, proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The proteins were then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose filter in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot chamber and detected as described previously (50Han Z. Chatterjee D. He D.M. Early J. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5849-5857Google Scholar, 54Han Z. Chatterjee D. Early J. Pantazis P. Hendrickson E.A. Wyche J.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1621-1628Google Scholar). Approximately 500,000 cpm of a 32P-radiolabeled 25-mer double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) probe was mixed with 5 µg of nuclear extract and incubated on ice for 5 min under conditions described in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Each sample was prepared in duplicate and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed. One half of the gel containing one set of the samples was dried on a piece of Whatman paper and exposed for autoradiography. The duplicate samples in the other half of the gel were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose filter using SDS-containing transfer buffer (20 mM Tris, 150 mM glycine, 20% methanol, 0.5% SDS, pH 8.0). The filter was washed in running tap water for 1 min before specific proteins on the filter were localized by standard Western analyses. By comparing the positions of the bands on the autoradiogram and Western blot, the presence of a particular protein in the DNA-protein complex can be determined. A protocol used by Gottlieb and Jackson (23Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Google Scholar) to UV cross-link Ku70 and DNA-PKcs proteins to DNA was slightly modified. Briefly, approximately (10 ng) 500,000 cpm of a 32P-radiolabeled double-stranded 25-mer DNA probe was mixed with 25 µg of nuclear extract in the presence or absence of 500 ng of unlabeled DNA in a final volume of 50 µl. The final mixture also contained 1 µg of pRSV-neo plasmid DNA, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, and 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min, followed by UV irradiation at 254 nm in a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene) for 5 min at room temperature. Then, 15 µl of a DNase I solution (500 units of DNase I, 50 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2) was added, and the DNA was digested at 37°C for 20 min. Five volumes of acetone were added to each sample, and proteins were precipitated at −20°C for 15 h. The precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,500 × g, dissolved in a urea-glycerol-SDS buffer, and subjected to electrophoresis in a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose filter and exposed to x-ray film. DNA-PKcs on the same filter was identified subsequently by Western analysis. Briefly, 100 µg of nuclear extract protein was incubated with 50 µl of dsDNA cellulose (30 mg/ml) in 1 ml K buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol) containing 60 mM NaCl for 30 min at 4°C (55Finnie N.J. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 320-324Google Scholar). The DNA cellulose was then washed by centrifugation 3 times in 1 ml of Z′0.05 buffer (55Finnie N.J. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 320-324Google Scholar). The DNA cellulose was then resuspended in 50 µl of potassium buffer. Using synthetic DNA·PK peptide substrates derived from the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain of murine p53 (wild-type peptide, EPPLAFADLLKK; mutated peptide, EPPLAFADLLKK), DNA·PK activity in an aliquot (13 µl) of the DNA celluloses was assayed as described elsewhere (55Finnie N.J. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 320-324Google Scholar). To determine the status of Ku and DNA-PKcs in the kinase reaction mixture, aliquots of the reaction mixture were electrophoresed in 6% (for DNA-PKcs) or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (for Ku) under reducing conditions, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters which were subjected to Western blot analysis for the presence of DNA-PKcs, Ku70 and Ku86 proteins. We have recently demonstrated that the human promyelocytic leukemic HL-60 cell line was hypersensitive to x-irradiation, whereas a stable clonal variant of the HL-60 cell line, HCW-2, was IR-resistant (50Han Z. Chatterjee D. He D.M. Early J. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5849-5857Google Scholar). Interestingly, both cell lines were proficient for DNA DSB repair and appeared to repair DSB lesions with identical kinetics (50Han Z. Chatterjee D. He D.M. Early J. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5849-5857Google Scholar). In addition, both HL-60 and HCW-2 cells progressed to G2 following x-irradiation; however, HL-60 cells, unlike HCW-2 cells which eventually resumed cell cycling, arrested at G2 for at least 48 h before they underwent apoptosis (50Han Z. Chatterjee D. He D.M. Early J. Pantazis P. Wyche J.H. Hendrickson E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5849-5857Google Scholar). Since much of the mammalian cellular response to x-irradiation appears to be mediated by the DNA·PK complex (reviewed in 13Jackson S.P. Jeggo P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 412-415Google Scholar, 25Anderson C.W. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 427-436Google Scholar, 26Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 500-503Google Scholar, 27Troelstra C. Jaspers N.G.J. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1149-1151Google Scholar, 28Weaver D.T. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 388-392Google Scholar), we investigated the status of this activity in HL-60 and HCW-2 cells. These results are presented below. The DNA binding component of the DNA·PK complex is provided by the Ku70 and Ku86 autoantigens and this binding activity can easily be detected by using dsDNA fragments in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (43Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4741-4748Google Scholar, 44Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7623-7627Google Scholar). Thus, nuclear extracts were prepared from HL-60 and HCW-2 cells, mixed with a radiolabeled 250-bp dsDNA fragment, and then analyzed for Ku·DNA complex formation by an EMSA (Fig. 1A). The results consistently showed two features. First, as the concentration of nuclear extract in the binding assay was increased, the mobility of the protein-DNA complexes became slower. At least four complexes of different mobility were observed for both HL-60 (L1-L4) and HCW-2 (H1-H4). The slowest moving complex for both cells appeared when the protein concentration in the binding assay was approximately 2.0 µg. This mobility change in association with increased protein concentration has been observed in many laboratories and has been interpreted as multiple Ku heterodimers binding to the same DNA probe (37de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Google Scholar, 40Paillard S. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5619-5624Google Scholar, 56Zhang W.-W. Yaneva M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 574-579Google Scholar). This is presumed to occur because, once bound to the end of a dsDNA fragment, Ku has the ability to translocate internally on that fragment, thus freeing up the end for another Ku heterodimer to bind (37de Vries E. van Driel W. Bergsma W.G. Arnberg A.C. van der Vliet P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 208: 65-78Google Scholar, 40Paillard S. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5619-5624Google Scholar, 57Tuteja N. Tuteja R. Ochem A. Taneja P. Huang N.W. Simoncsits A. Susic S. Rahman K. Marusic L. Chen J. Zhang J. Wang S. Pongor S. Falaschi A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4991-5001Google Scholar). More interestingly, however, was the observation that the mobility of HL-60 complexes was always faster than the corresponding HCW-2 complexes (Fig. 1A, compare L1 with H1, L2 with H2, etc.). These results suggested that the Ku·DNA complexes of HL-60 were different from those of HCW-2. It has been demonstrated that a 25–30-bp dsDNA fragment is the minimum length required for the binding of a single Ku heterodimer (38Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Google Scholar). Thus, a 25-mer dsDNA probe was prepared and used for EMSA analysis with HL-60 and HCW-2 nuclear extracts. The resulting HL-60 complex (L1) still migrated faster than the corresponding HCW-2 complex (H1) (Fig. 1B). Thus the size differences observed on a larger fragment (Fig. 1A) could be observed with a minimal DNA binding site (Fig. 1B), and this was suggestive that the difference in DNA binding between the two cell lines was an inherent property of the Ku heterodimer and not due to additional factors. We next surveyed a large number of human cell lines for their Ku DEB activity. Jurkat and HT-H9 T cell lymphoma cell lines showed the higher HCW-2 pattern (Fig. 1B) as did a variety of transformed and nontransformed cell lines derived from different tissues (data not shown). Thus, it appeared as if it was the lower (HL-60) Ku DEB pattern which was abnormal. We sought to identify the nature of the alteration in Ku·DNA complexes in HL-60 cells. As a first approach we attempted to confirm the presence or absence of Ku70 and Ku86 proteins in the HL-60 Ku·DNA complexes. This was achieved by using mAbs in EMSA “supershift” experiments. Thus, nuclear extracts were prepared from HL-60 and HCW-2 cells and incubated with a ∼250-bp radiolabeled probe in the presence or absence of mAbs specific for Ku polypeptides before being subjected to electrophoresis. Ab 162 (52Wang J. Chou C.H. Blankson J. Satoh M. Knuth M.W. Eisenberg R.A. Pisetsky D.S. Reeves W.H. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 18: 15-28Google Scholar, 53Wang J. Satoh M. Pierani A. Schmitt J. Chou C.-H. Stunnenberg H.G. Roeder R.G. Reeves W.H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3223-3233Google Scholar), was recently shown to recognize an epitope defined by the heterodimer of Ku70/Ku86. In the presence of this antibody, both the HL-60 (L1, L2, and L3) complexes and the HCW-2 (H1 and H2) complexes were completely supershifted and retarded in the gel (Fig. 2). A different result, however, was obtained using mAb 111, which recognizes an epitope on the C terminus (defined by amino acids 610–705) of the Ku86 protein (51Porges A.J. Ng T. Reeves W.T. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4222-4228Google Scholar). This antibody clearly supershifted the HCW-2 Ku·DNA complexes although not as completely as mAb 162. The lower reactivity of mAb 111 in supershift assays has been previously observed in other laboratories and is probably an inherent property of this mAb (18Boubnov N.V. Hall K.T. Wills Z. Lee S.E. He D.M. Benjamin D.M. Pulaski C.R. Band H. Reeves W. Hendrickson E.A. Weaver D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 890-894Google Scholar). In contrast to HCW-2 extracts, however, mAb 111 did not affect the migration of the HL-60 complexes at all. A control monoclonal antibody specific for the human bcl-x proteins similarly did not affect the migration of the Ku complexes (Fig. 2). From these results we concluded that although both Ku70 and Ku86 were present in the HL-60 Ku·DNA complexes, the Ku86 C terminus was either altered or missing, such that mAb 111 could no longer react with it. To pursue the above observation, we next performed Western blot analyses of nuclear Ku proteins from HL-60 and HCW-2 cells using additional monoclonal antibodies that react against different epitopes of Ku. mAb N3H10 is specific for an epitope (defined by amino acids 506–541) in the C terminus of Ku70 (51Porges A.J. Ng T. Reeves W.T. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 4222-4228Google Scholar). This mAb detected equal amounts of Ku70 proteins"

When treated with appropriate hormonal stimuli, 3T3-L1 fibroblasts initiate a differentiation program resulting in conversion to lipid-accumulating, adipocyte-like cells. Pre-adipocytes express amounts of PDGFαR and PDGFβR mRNA and protein that are similar to levels expressed in other murine 3T3 fibroblasts. In contrast, the expression of both α and β receptor transcripts is greatly reduced in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. The loss of PDGFR mRNA following induction of differentiation precedes morphological conversion as well as the induction of many adipocyte-specific genes. The amounts of cell surface PDGFR protein diminish in parallel with the mRNA levels during differentiation, as shown by Western blotting and PDGF-binding assays. The reduced expression of PDGFRs does not reflect a general down-regulation of growth factor receptors, as expression of the type 1 FGFR is unaffected by terminal differentiation. The PDGFβR promoter drives strong expression of a luciferase reporter gene in pre-adipocytes, but not in differentiated cells, indicating that the decrease in PDGFR expression following induction of differentiation is a transcriptionally regulated event. Decreased PDGFR expression in differentiated cells is associated with impaired biological responsiveness to PDGF, as shown by reduced activation of mitogen-activated protein-kinase following PDGF stimulation, and decreased chemotactic responsiveness to PDGF.

https://openalex.org/W2010860269,"Human mesangial cells express an inducible form of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) after treatment with cytokines. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor for NOS, is required for cytokine-induced NO generation. We report here that BH4 is necessary not only for the activity but also for the expression of iNOS in human mesangial cells. Inhibition of de novo BH4 synthesis with 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP) significantly attenuated iNOS activity as well as mRNA and protein expression in response to interleukin 1β plus tumor necrosis factor α (IL-1β/TNF-α). In contrast, sepiapterin, which provides BH4 through the pterin salvage pathway, strongly potentiated IL-1β/TNF-α-induced iNOS expression and abrogated the inhibitory effect of DAHP. Inhibition of the pterin salvage pathway with methotrexate abolished sepiapterin potentiation of iNOS induction but did not alter the effect of IL-1β/TNF-α. Determination of intracellular pteridines confirmed that sepiapterin markedly raised BH4 content, an effect that was blocked by methotrexate. These results suggest that BH4 availability plays an important role in the regulation of iNOS expression. The effect of BH4 appears to be mediated, at least in part, by an increase in mRNA stability, as indicated by the observation that DAHP shortened, whereas sepiapterin prolonged the half-life of IL-1β/TNF-α-induced iNOS mRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that the biosynthesis of BH4 contributes to cytokine induction of iNOS expression in human mesangial cells through the stabilization of iNOS mRNA. Human mesangial cells express an inducible form of nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) after treatment with cytokines. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor for NOS, is required for cytokine-induced NO generation. We report here that BH4 is necessary not only for the activity but also for the expression of iNOS in human mesangial cells. Inhibition of de novo BH4 synthesis with 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP) significantly attenuated iNOS activity as well as mRNA and protein expression in response to interleukin 1β plus tumor necrosis factor α (IL-1β/TNF-α). In contrast, sepiapterin, which provides BH4 through the pterin salvage pathway, strongly potentiated IL-1β/TNF-α-induced iNOS expression and abrogated the inhibitory effect of DAHP. Inhibition of the pterin salvage pathway with methotrexate abolished sepiapterin potentiation of iNOS induction but did not alter the effect of IL-1β/TNF-α. Determination of intracellular pteridines confirmed that sepiapterin markedly raised BH4 content, an effect that was blocked by methotrexate. These results suggest that BH4 availability plays an important role in the regulation of iNOS expression. The effect of BH4 appears to be mediated, at least in part, by an increase in mRNA stability, as indicated by the observation that DAHP shortened, whereas sepiapterin prolonged the half-life of IL-1β/TNF-α-induced iNOS mRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that the biosynthesis of BH4 contributes to cytokine induction of iNOS expression in human mesangial cells through the stabilization of iNOS mRNA.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Google Scholar, 2Moncada S. Higgs E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Google Scholar). In addition, an altered NO generation is involved in several pathophysiological situations, including chronic and acute inflammation, atherosclerosis, glomerulonephritis, and renal failure (3Laskin J.D. Heck D.E. Laskin D.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 5: 377-382Google Scholar, 4Cooke J.P. Singer A.H. Tsao P. Zera P. Rowan R.A. Billingham M.E. J. Clin.

The synthesis of NO is accomplished by the NO synthases (NOS), a family of enzymes from which three isoforms are presently known. The neuronal and endothelial NOS are considered constitutive, and their activity is regulated mainly posttranslationally. The inducible isoform (iNOS) is expressed in various cell types, including macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells, in response to certain stimuli, such as cytokines or bacterial cell products, and its regulation occurs mostly at the level of transcription (6Nathan C. Xie Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13725-13728Google Scholar, 7Nathan C. Xie Q. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Google Scholar). NOS require several cofactors for activity, namely, FAD, FMN, heme, and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) (8Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Google Scholar, 9Klatt P. Schmidt K. Uray G. Mayer B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14781-14787Google Scholar). Heme and BH4 have been shown to be required for dimerization and acquisition of NO-generating capacity by macrophage iNOS (8Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Google Scholar). In addition, BH4 availability has been demonstrated to be a limiting factor for iNOS activity in many cell types (10Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reinberger G. Wachter H. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1599-1607Google Scholar, 11Gross S.S. Levi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25722-25729Google Scholar, 12Schoedon G. Schneemann M.

The intracellular levels of BH4 are determined by the activity of two different biosynthetic pathways: the de novo synthesis from GTP and the regeneration of BH4 from dihydropterins through a pterin salvage pathway (14Nichol C.A. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Google Scholar). The first enzyme in the de novo pathway is GTP cyclohydrolase I. Cytokines have been reported to stimulate potently the de novo synthesis of BH4 in several cell types through the induction of GTP cyclohydrolase I (15Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Schmidt K. Weiss G. Wachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1842-1846Google Scholar, 16Hattori Y. Gross S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Physiol. 1994; 266: L455-L460Google Scholar). In fact, expression of GTP cyclohydrolase I and iNOS appears to be regulated coordinately (16Hattori Y. Gross S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 435-441Google Scholar, 18Werner E.R. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 203: 1-12Google Scholar). This phenomenon has been interpreted previously as a mechanism to ensure an adequate supply of BH4 for the activity of cytokine-induced NOS (10Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reinberger G. Wachter H. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1599-1607Google Scholar, 11Gross S.S. Levi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25722-25729Google Scholar, 12Schoedon G. Schneemann M. Hofer S. Guerrero L.

Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 203: 1-12Google Scholar). In addition to its catalytic role, BH4 has been reported to protect NOS from feedback inhibition by NO in vitro (19Griscavage J.M. Fukuto J.M. Komori Y. Ignarro L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21644-21649Google Scholar, 20Hyun J. Komori Y. Chaudhuri G. Ignarro L.J. Fukuto J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 380-386Google Scholar), and to stabilize the structure of both the macrophage and the neuronal NOS proteins (8Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21120-21129Google Scholar, 21Giovanelli J. Campos K.L. Kaufman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7091-7095Google Scholar). We were interested in studying the possibility that BH4 could also be modulating iNOS protein or mRNA expression. To test this hypothesis we have used human mesangial cells (HMC) as an experimental model. Mesangial cells are specialized vascular smooth muscle cells that are disposed around the capillaries of the renal glomerulus serving functions of structural support and regulation of glomerular filtration rate (22Mené P. Simonson M.S. Dunn M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 1347-1425Google Scholar). These cells express iNOS in response to cytokines (23Marsden P.A. Ballermann B.J. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1843-1852Google Scholar, 24Pfeilschifter J. Schwarzenbach H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 185-187Google Scholar, 25Schultz P.J. Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. Raij L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F600-F606Google Scholar). In contrast to rat mesangial cells, which can be induced with single stimulants (24Pfeilschifter J. Schwarzenbach H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 185-187Google Scholar, 25Schultz P.J. Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. Raij L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F600-F606Google Scholar), HMC require multiple cytokines to produce NO (26Nicolson A.G. Haites N.E. McKay N.G. Wilson H.M. MacLeod A.M. Benjamin N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1269-1274Google Scholar). In this article, we have studied the effect of BH4 availability on the expression of iNOS by HMC elicited by a combination of interleukin 1β plus tumor necrosis factor α (IL-1β/TNF-α). The results herein reported suggest that BH4 modulates iNOS mRNA expression, thus identifying a new role for this cofactor in the complex regulation of cytokine-induced NO generation. nitric oxide nitric-oxide synthase(s) inducible nitric-oxide synthase(s) 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(L-erythro-1,2-dihydroxypropyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridin 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine human mesangial cells high performance liquid chromatography interleukin tumor necrosis factor-α L-nitroarginine methyl ester. Recombinant human TNF-α (9.8 × 106 units/mg) was a gift from Knoll Pharmaceuticals (Whippany, NJ). Recombinant human IL-1β (5 × 107 units/mg) was from Boehringer Mannheim. Cell culture media and fetal calf serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was from Amersham Corp. Antibodies for cell characterization were obtained from local sources. L-Sepiapterin was from Alexis Co. (Laüfelfingen, Switzerland). All other reagents used were of the highest purity available from Sigma. HMC were obtained from normal cadaver kidneys that were unsuitable for transplantation. Primary cultures were obtained using a technique of graded sieving. Groups of cells with mesangial morphology were subcloned and expanded. Mesangial cells displayed positive staining with anti-vimentin, anti-Thy 1.1, and anti-myosin and absence of staining with anti-factor VIII. The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 24 µg/ml gentamycin. For experiments, passages 7–12 were used. Confluent HMC were washed twice with RPMI without phenol red and incubated in this medium with the indicated agents in the absence of serum. TNF-α was used at 100 ng/ml, and IL-1β was used at 2 ng/ml, final concentrations. Several doses of sepiapterin (0.1-200 µM), DAHP (0.5-2 mM), and methotrexate (5–20 µM) were tested, and those found optimal for potentiation or inhibition of iNOS activity in HMC, respectively (100 µM sepiapterin, 1.5 mM DAHP, 10 µM methotrexate), were used for further experimentation. Potential toxicity of the reagents used on HMC was evaluated by trypan blue exclusion. According to these criteria, cell viability was above 90% under all experimental conditions studied. The accumulation of nitrite in the cell culture supernatant of HMC was taken as an index of iNOS activity. After treatment with the various agents for 24 h, nitrite was determined in the supernatants of HMC by the Griess reaction as described previously (27Saura M. López S. Rodríguez-Puyol M. Rodríguez-Puyol D. Lamas S. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 500-509Google Scholar), using sodium nitrite as a standard. Total cellular RNA was isolated from HMC using the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). 10 µg of total RNA was separated on 1% agarose, 0.66 M formaldehyde gels, transferred to Hybond hybridization transfer membranes (Amersham), and UV cross-linked before hybridization as described previously (27Saura M. López S. Rodríguez-Puyol M. Rodríguez-Puyol D. Lamas S. Kidney Int. 1995; 47: 500-509Google Scholar). A 1.8-kilobase fragment of the human hepatic inducible NOS isoform cDNA, a gift of Dr. D. Geller (29Geller D.A. Lowenstein C.J. Shapiro R.A. Nussler A.K. Di Silvio M. Wang S.C. Nakayama D.K. Simmons R.L. Snyder S.H. Billiar T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3491-3495Google Scholar), was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a commercial kit for random hexamer labeling (Boehringer Mannheim) and used as probe for Northern analysis. Hybridization was performed at 42°C for 12–16 h. Membranes were then washed at final stringency conditions of 55°C, 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and exposed to XAR Kodak film at −80°C using an intensifying screen. To identify differences in mRNA expression specific for iNOS, blots were denuded and rehybridized with a β-actin probe (30Alonso S. Minty A. Bourlet Y. Buckingam M. J. Mol. Evol. 1986; 23: 11-22Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis was performed on a computing densitometer or on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Results are expressed in arbitrary units as the ratio of iNOS to β-actin expression. HMC were stimulated with IL-1β/TNF-α for 24 h in the presence or absence of DAHP or sepiapterin. For determination of mRNA half-life, actinomycin D (10 µg/ml) was added subsequently, and cells were then harvested for RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis every 2 h for 8 h as described above. HMC treated for 24 h with the indicated agents were harvested with a cell scraper and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Pellets were resuspended in 250 µl of distilled water and homogenized by sonication with an ultrasonic cell disrupter. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 3 min, and the supernatants were split into two aliquots that were subjected to oxidation with iodine at alkaline or at acidic pH, essentially as described (31Fukushima T. Nixon J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 176-188Google Scholar). During alkaline oxidation 7,8-dihydrobiopterin is converted into biopterin (90% conversion), and BH4 is converted into pterin (approximately 80% conversion), whereas during acidic oxidation both pteridines are quantitatively converted into biopterin (32Antonozzi I. Carducci C. Vestri L. Pontecorvi A. Moretti F. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 459: 319-324Google Scholar). After partial purification on Dowex 50 ion exchange columns (31Fukushima T. Nixon J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 176-188Google Scholar), pteridines were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC on a Vydac RP C-18 column (The Separations Group, Hesperia, CA) using 5% methanol, 15 mM ammonium acetate, 0.05% triethylamine adjusted to pH 5.7 with acetic acid as eluant, at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. 6-Methylpterine (200 pmol) was added to all samples as internal standard (32Antonozzi I. Carducci C. Vestri L. Pontecorvi A. Moretti F. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 459: 319-324Google Scholar). Quantification was performed using a Hewlett Packard 1046A fluorescence detector programmed at 271 nm, excitation wavelength, and 441 nm, emission wavelength. The concentration of BH4 in every sample was calculated from the difference between the amount of biopterin measured in the aliquot subjected to acidic oxidation (which corresponds to total biopterin: biopterin plus 7,8-dihydrobiopterin plus BH4) and the amount of biopterin measured in the aliquot subjected to alkaline oxidation (which corresponds to 7,8-dihydrobiopterin plus biopterin) (32Antonozzi I. Carducci C. Vestri L. Pontecorvi A. Moretti F. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 459: 319-324Google Scholar). For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, HMC were homogenized by sonication in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.1 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, containing 2 µg/ml each of the protease inhibitors: leupeptin, pepstatin, trypsin inhibitor, and aprotinin. Aliquots from each experimental condition containing 10 µg of protein were electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a semidry electroblotting system (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco). Blots were probed with anti-iNOS mouse monoclonal antibody from Affinity Research Products (Nottingham, U. K.), and the iNOS protein was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system from Amersham. A lysate from mouse macrophages stimulated with interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide provided by Affinity Research Products was used as positive control. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed with the use of the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. When the number of observations was insufficient to perform adequate parametric tests, nonparametric tests were employed (Kruskal-Wallis). Comparisons were considered statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. Treatment of HMC with IL-1β/TNF-α for 24 h resulted in the induction of NO generation as indicated by the accumulation of nitrite in the incubation medium (Fig. 1). NO generation in response to cytokines was L-arginine-dependent since it was inhibited potently by the NOS antagonist L-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME). The addition of 500 µML-NAME during cytokine stimulation produced an 80–85% inhibition of NO synthesis. To determine the importance of BH4 supply for cytokine-induced NOS activity, we explored the effect of both donors and inhibitors of BH4 generation on nitrite formation by IL-1β/TNF-α-stimulated HMC. Inhibition of the de novo synthesis of BH4 with DAHP, an inhibitor of GTP cyclohydrolase I (33Gal E.M. Nelson T.M. Sherman A.D. Neurochem. Res. 1978; 3: 69-88Google Scholar), significantly reduced IL-1β/TNF-α-induced nitrite production. In contrast, addition of sepiapterin, which provides BH4 via the dihydrofolate reductase-dependent pterin salvage pathway (14Nichol C.A. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Google Scholar), produced a strong potentiation of cytokine-induced NO generation and circumvented the inhibitory effect of DAHP, although it did not elicit nitrite formation by uninduced cells (Fig. 1). Sepiapterin potentiation of cytokine-induced nitrite accumulation was dose-dependent, 1 µM being the lowest concentration that induced a significant (2-fold) increase over the values obtained by stimulation with IL-1β/TNF-α alone (results not shown). At 100 µM, sepiapterin produced a 6–8-fold potentiation of cytokine-elicited NO generation (Fig. 1). This effect, which was also L-arginine-dependent, was unaffected by DAHP. However, inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase with methotrexate (14Nichol C.A. Smith G.K. Duch D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 729-764Google Scholar) completely prevented sepiapterin potentiation of cytokine-induced NO generation. In fact, when sepiapterin was given in combination with methotrexate, a slight inhibition of cytokine-induced NO synthesis could be observed. This effect could be attributed to a direct inhibitory action of sepiapterin on GTP cyclohydrolase I (34Shen R.-S. Alam A. Zhang Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 965: 9-15Google Scholar), which can be unveiled after blocking its conversion to BH4 (11Gross S.S. Levi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25722-25729Google Scholar). In contrast, the addition of methotrexate to IL-1β/TNF-α-treated HMC did not affect the accumulation of nitrite in the incubation medium of HMC (Fig. 1), suggesting that generation of BH4 through the salvage pathway is quantitatively less important during cytokine stimulation of HMC. Taken together, these results indicate that BH4 biosynthesis is a necessary event during cytokine-induced NO generation by HMC. The potentiation of cytokine-induced nitrite accumulation described above could be due to an enhancement of the catalytic activity of iNOS by BH4. In addition, BH4 could play a regulatory role at the level of protein or mRNA expression. To test this hypothesis, we examined the levels of iNOS mRNA in HMC in the conditions under which we had observed changes in iNOS activity. Treatment of HMC with IL-1β/TNF-α for 24 h induced the appearance of the iNOS transcript, which was undetectable in untreated cells as well as in cells treated with sepiapterin alone (Fig. 2). The addition of DAHP significantly diminished the levels of iNOS mRNA in response to IL-1β/TNF-α. Conversely, supplementing the incubation medium with sepiapterin resulted in a 6–8-fold potentiation of cytokine-induced iNOS mRNA expression. Sepiapterin potentiation of iNOS mRNA expression was unaffected by DAHP, but it was completely prevented by methotrexate. Quantitation of these results by densitometric analysis revealed the existence of a close correlation between iNOS activity (Fig. 1) and mRNA levels (Fig. 2B) under the various conditions studied. This correlation could also be evidenced when iNOS expression was studied at the protein level by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). These results suggested that BH4 biosynthesis was required not only for iNOS activity but also for its expression. To study the relationship between BH4 availability and the observed effects on iNOS activity and expression, changes in BH4 levels in response to the various agents used were monitored. BH4 levels in control HMC were below 0.5 pmol/mg protein. Although no significant changes in intracellular BH4 levels could be evidenced after 24-h treatment with either IL-1β/TNF-α or IL-1β/TNF-α plus DAHP, the addition of sepiapterin to the incubation medium did result in a potent increase in total intracellular biopterin levels (sum of biopterin plus 7,8-dihydrobiopterin plus BH4), up to 53.5 ± 8.5 pmol/mg protein. Approximately 65% of this increase was due to the generation of BH4. The conversion of sepiapterin into BH4 was totally and selectively prevented by methotrexate, without significantly reducing total biopterin levels (45.4 ± 9.6 pmol/mg protein). This indicates that sepiapterin potentiation of iNOS expression requires its conversion into BH4. To gain insight into the mechanism of the effect of BH4 on iNOS expression, we evaluated its potential contribution to iNOS mRNA stability. For this purpose, the half-life of iNOS mRNA from HMC that had been treated with IL-1β/TNF-α alone or in combination with sepiapterin or DAHP as in Fig. 2 was estimated after the addition of actinomycin D (Fig. 4). We observed that DAHP significantly shortened iNOS mRNA half-life, from 6.1 ± 1.0 to 2.8 ± 0.1 h (p < 0.05), whereas the addition of sepiapterin to cytokine-treated HMC resulted in a marked stabilization of iNOS mRNA, the half-life of which increased to 14.4 ± 3.2 h (p < 0.05). These effects contribute to generate the differences in iNOS mRNA levels illustrated in Fig. 2. To assess the potential role of NO as a mediator of the effect of BH4 on iNOS expression, we first tested whether limiting NO generation with L-NAME would inhibit sepiapterin potentiation of cytokine-induced iNOS mRNA expression. We observed that in conditions in which L-NAME markedly reduced the accumulation of nitrite in the supernatant of cells treated with sepiapterin plus cytokines (Fig. 5A), the ability of sepiapterin to potentiate cytokine-induced expression of iNOS mRNA was not affected significantly (Fig. 5, B and C). We investigated next whether an exogenous supply of NO could mimic the effect of sepiapterin. As shown in Fig. 5, supplementing the incubation medium with sodium nitroprusside during treatment with cytokines did not induce any further increase in iNOS mRNA levels. BH4 biosynthesis appears to be an essential requirement for the induction of NOS activity in a variety of experimental models (11Gross S.S. Levi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25722-25729Google Scholar, 13Mühl H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 1302-1306Google Scholar, 35Schoedon G. Blau N. Schneemann M. Flury G. Schaffner A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 504-510Google Scholar). Evidence for this has arisen mainly from the use of inhibitors of the BH4 biosynthetic pathway, including inhibitors of GTP cyclohydrolase I, such as DAHP (33Gal E.M. Nelson T.M. Sherman A.D. Neurochem. Res. 1978; 3: 69-88Google Scholar), or of sepiapterin reductase, such as N-acetylserotonin, phenprocoumon, or dicumarol (36Katoh S. Sueoka T. Yamada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 75-81Google Scholar, 37Sueoka T. Katoh S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 843: 193-198Google Scholar), which cause a depletion of intracellular BH4 levels, both in resting and in stimulated cells (15Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A. Reibnegger G. Schmidt K. Weiss G. Wachter H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1842-1846Google Scholar, 17Nakayama D.K. Geller D.A. Di Silvio M. Bloomgarden G. Davies P. Pitt B.R. Hatakeyama K. Kagamiyama H. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L455-L460Google Scholar, 38Sakai N. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 43: 6-10Google Scholar). Since the amount of NO generated seems to be limited by the amount of BH4 present in cells, the inhibition of BH4 biosynthesis has been envisaged as a target for the design of therapeutic tools to be used in the pathological conditions associated with an abnormally increased NO production (12Schoedon G. Schneemann M. Hofer S. Guerrero L. Blau N. Schaffner A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 833-839Google Scholar, 13Mühl H. Pfeilschifter J. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 1302-1306Google Scholar, 35Schoedon G. Blau N. Schneemann M. Flury G. Schaffner A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 504-510Google Scholar). It is assumed that the main role of the increased pteridine synthesis observed during cytokine stimulation in a variety of cell types is to provide a cofactor for the BH4-dependent generation of NO by the cytokine-induced NOS. Our results indicate, however, that BH4 biosynthesis also contributes to the regulation of the expression of iNOS mRNA and protein in response to cytokine stimulation of HMC. We have observed that the GTP cyclohydrolase I inhibitor DAHP notably diminishes cytokine-induced iNOS mRNA accumulation. In contrast, increasing BH4 availability via the salvage pathway by the addition of sepiapterin not only circumvents the inhibitory effect of DAHP, but it strongly potentiates the effect of cytokines on iNOS mRNA and protein induction. Thus, in HMC, the mechanism of DAHP inhibition of iNOS expression appears to be due to the limitation of BH4 biosynthesis, although a BH4-independent effect of DAHP on iNOS expression, analogous to that reported in primary murine macrophages (39Bogdan C. Werner E. Stenger S. Wachter H. Rollinghoff M. Werner-Felmayer G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 69-74Google Scholar), cannot be ruled out. Therefore, our results reinforce the significance of the frequently observed coinduction of GTP cyclohydrolase and iNOS by inflammatory stimuli (16Hattori Y. Gross S.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 435-441Google Scholar, 17Nakayama D.K. Geller D.A. Di Silvio M. Bloomgarden G. Davies P. Pitt B.R. Hatakeyama K. Kagamiyama H. Simmons R.L. Billiar T.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L455-L460Google Scholar). Although cytokines have been reported to stimulate the activity of GTP cyclohydrolase I strongly in a variety of systems, the overall stimulation of BH4 biosynthesis and its impact on iNOS induction appear to be highly variable depending on the cell type, the stimuli employed, and the basal BH4 levels (18Werner E.R. Werner-Felmayer G. Wachter H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 203: 1-12Google Scholar, 39Bogdan C. Werner E. Stenger S. Wachter H. Rollinghoff M. Werner-Felmayer G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 69-74Google Scholar). The BH4 content of untreated HMC is remarkably low. The cytokine combination used throughout this study, IL-1β/TNF-α, elicited a submaximal induction of iNOS in these cells, which was not paralleled by a significant increase in intracellular BH4 levels, but it was nevertheless susceptible to modulation by the inhibition of BH4 biosynthesis or by the addition of an exogenous BH4 source. This suggests that BH4 availability is indeed playing a role in the regulation of iNOS expression in HMC. On the other hand, discrepancies between nitrite accumulation and cytosolic BH4 concentrations during iNOS induction have been documented and interpreted previously on the basis that the newly synthesized iNOS protein, which has high affinity for BH4 (40Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7160-7165Google Scholar), depletes BH4 from the cytosol rapidly (12Schoedon G. Schneemann M. Hofer S. Guerrero L. Blau N. Schaffner A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 833-839Google Scholar). In this way, BH4 would become a limiting factor for full iNOS activity probably because of a relatively lesser induction of BH4 biosynthesis (12Schoedon G. Schneemann M. Hofer S. Guerrero L. Blau N. Schaffner A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 833-839Google Scholar). The effect of BH4 on iNOS expression in HMC appears to be mediated, at least in part, by a contribution to mRNA stabilization since DAHP significantly reduced iNOS mRNA half-life, whereas sepiapterin prolonged it. This implies that in HMC, iNOS expression can be subjected to regulation at the posttranscriptional level. In addition, preliminary results from our laboratory suggest that increasing BH4 availability with sepiapterin could also have stimulatory effects on the transcription rate of iNOS mRNA in nuclear runoff assays (results not shown). However, the intrinsic biochemical mechanisms of these phenomena remain to be elucidated. It should be noted that an increment in BH4 levels per se, like that brought about by sepiapterin supplementation, was not able to induce iNOS activity or mRNA expression in HMC. In addition, the existence of BH4-dependent proteins involved in mRNA stabilization and/or transcription factors has not been documented. Thus, a direct effect of BH4 on iNOS mRNA expression seems unlikely. Clearly, other possibilities of interaction between BH4 availability and iNOS induction need to be considered, including the potential contribution of the NO generated as a consequence of iNOS activity. NO has been reported to exert both negative and positive feedback on iNOS activity and expression (41Park S.K. Lin H.L. Murphy S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 762-768Google Scholar, 42Mühl H. Pfeilschifter J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1941-1946Google Scholar). In astroglial cells, the expression of iNOS mRNA elicited by a combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ has been found to be amplified in the presence of NOS inhibitors or NO-trapping agents and to be reduced by NO donors (41Park S.K. Lin H.L. Murphy S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 762-768Google Scholar). Interestingly, BH4 has been reported to inactivate NO by inducing its oxidation in a 1:1 stoichiometry (43Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Google Scholar). Therefore, BH4 could be acting as a NO scavenging agent in HMC, thus attenuating NO negative feedback on iNOS expression. In contrast, in rat mesangial cells, NO has been described to potentiate IL-1β-induced iNOS expression (42Mühl H. Pfeilschifter J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1941-1946Google Scholar). In this context, BH4 availability would influence iNOS activity and consequently the amount of NO generated, which in turn would be responsible for the potentiation of iNOS induction (42Mühl H. Pfeilschifter J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1941-1946Google Scholar). However, in neither of these experimental systems did NO appear to influence iNOS mRNA stability (41Park S.K. Lin H.L. Murphy S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 762-768Google Scholar, 42Mühl H. Pfeilschifter J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1941-1946Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, the manipulation of the NO generated by means of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside and the NOS inhibitor L-NAME did not result in substantial changes in cytokine-induced iNOS expression or in its potentiation by sepiapterin. Although detailed studies would be needed to clarify completely the effects of NO on iNOS expression, our results do not support a major role for NO in the amplification of iNOS induction observed in HMC. The results herein reported suggest that the induction of iNOS in HMC results from the integration of multiple signals. On one hand, cytokines would directly stimulate responsive elements on the iNOS gene. At the same time, they would indirectly potentiate the activity and expression of iNOS by stimulating the synthesis of BH4, which would contribute to the catalytic activity of iNOS and to iNOS mRNA expression. In vivo, the supply of BH4 to perform these functions could come from several sources: from the activation of the BH4 biosynthetic pathway in the mesangial cells and/or in the endothelial cells that line the capillaries of the glomerulus. In human endothelial cells, interferon-γ, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, IL-1, and TNF-α have been reported to stimulate the synthesis of BH4 (15Werner-Felmayer G. Werner E.R. Fuchs D. Hausen A.

Schneemann M. Blau N. Edgell C.-J.S. Schaffner A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1343-1348Google Scholar). Interestingly, up to 90% of the newly synthesized BH4 is released into the culture medium (45Schoedon G. Schneemann M. Blau N. Edgell C.-J.S. Schaffner A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1343-1348Google Scholar). This release is not random, but vectorially directed into the basal compartment, thereby providing underlining smooth muscle cells with the cofactor needed for NO production (46Schaffner A. Blau N. Schneemann M. Steurer J. Edgell C.-J.S. Schoedon G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 516-523Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the secreted BH4 can also potentiate iNOS mRNA expression in HMC. Importantly, some of the so-called deactivating cytokines, including IL-4 and IL-10, have been reported to suppress profoundly the BH4 synthesis elicited by inflammatory stimuli in endothelial cells, leading to the complete disappearance of extracellular BH4 (45Schoedon G. Schneemann M. Blau N. Edgell C.-J.S. Schaffner A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1343-1348Google Scholar). These deactivating cytokines are also known to inhibit iNOS activity and expression in various cell types (47Cunha F.Q. Moncada S. Liew F.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1155-1159Google Scholar, 48Bogdan C. Vodovotz Y. Paik J. Xie Q.-W. Nathan C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 227-233Google Scholar). It would be interesting to determine whether the inhibitory effect of these cytokines on iNOS expression can be mediated, at least in part, by the down-regulation of BH4 biosynthesis, and if so, whether GTP cyclohydrolase I can be a target for their action. In conclusion, our observation that the availability of BH4 can modulate the expression of iNOS in HMC strengthens the hypothesis that this cofactor can play an important role in the regulation of NO generation and consequently of vascular tone. Therefore, the pharmacological manipulation of BH4 levels emerges as a valuable approach for the management of NO-related pathophysiological processes.

In this paper we investigate the underlying mechanism using Hep G2 cells. SR-12813 inhibited incorporation of tritiated water into cholesterol with an IC50 of 1.2 µM but had no effect on fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, SR-12813 reduced cellular 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity with an IC50 of 0.85 µM. The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity was rapid with a T1/2 of 10 min. After a 16-h incubation with SR-12813, mRNA levels of HMG-CoA reductase and low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor were increased. The increased expression of LDL receptor translated into a higher LDL uptake, which can explain the primary hypocholesterolemic effect of SR-12813 in vivo. Western blot analysis indicated that the amount of HMG-CoA reductase protein rapidly decreased in the presence of SR-12813. Pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine showed that the T1/2 of HMG-CoA reductase degradation decreased in the presence of SR-12813 from 90 to 20 min. Pre-incubation with 50 µM of lovastatin did not prevent the effects of SR-12813 on HMG-CoA reductase degradation, indicating that the compound does not need mevalonate-derived regulators for its action.

SR-12813 (tetra-ethyl 2-(3, 5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethenyl-1,1-bisphosphonate; see Fig. 1) and related compounds are potent hypocholesterolemic drugs in mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, dog, and monkey (1Suckling K.E.

To explain these cholesterol-lowering effects, studies were initiated in the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2. These cells are particularly suitable to study effects on lipid metabolism (2Gherardi E. Thomas K. Le Cras T.D. Fitzsimmons C. Moorby C.D. Bowyer D.E. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 531-539Google Scholar, 3Erickson S.K. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1986; 27: 875-883Google Scholar, 4Javitt N.B. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 161-168Google Scholar). Our initial studies in Hep G2 cells showed that SR-12813 inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis at the level of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) 1The abbreviations used are: HMG-CoA3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme ALPDSlipoprotein-deficient serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineLDLlow density lipoprotein. reductase, the key regulatory enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (5Rodwell V.W. Nordstrom J.L. Mitchselen J.J. Adv. Lipid Res. 1976; 14: 1-74Google Scholar). The regulation of cellular HMG-CoA reductase activity is extremely complicated. The basis for this is that mevalonate, the product of the enzymatic reaction, is not only the precursor for the biosynthesis of cholesterol but also for a variety of other important products like dolichols, ubiquinones, and isoprenoids, which are required for growth and survival of the cell. Feedback mechanisms for the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway impinge on HMG-CoA reductase expression. HMG-CoA reductase is regulated on a transcriptional level by (oxy)sterols (6Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1450-1461Google Scholar, 7Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8929-8937Google Scholar). Post-transcriptionally, feedback regulation on HMG-CoA reductase synthesis and degradation is provided by isoprenoid metabolites (7Nakanishi M. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

In the present report we present evidence that SR-12813 decreases cholesterol synthesis by increasing HMG-CoA reductase degradation. Our data further show that none of the other known regulation mechanisms as mentioned above is involved and that SR-12813 does not inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity directly. Two alternative proposals were tested, that SR-12813 functions as a direct suppressor or that it elicits the formation of regulatory isoprenoids. Our results favor a direct action and further suggest that SR-12813 operates to rapidly inactivate of HMG-CoA reductase activity by a mechanism that primes the enzyme for degradation.

Tritiated water incorporation into lipids followed basically the protocol of (24Berkhout T.A. Havekes L.M. Pearce N.J. Groot P.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 181-186Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were grown to 80% confluency. SR-12813 in Me2SO (final concentration, 0.1%) was added 1 h before the addition of 1.8 mCi of [3H2O] to each well. Cells were incubated for a further hour, and tritium incorporation in cholesterol and fatty acids was determined as described (24Berkhout T.A. Havekes L.M. Pearce N.J. Groot P.H. Biochem.

The chloroform layer was dried under nitrogen, and the lipid fraction was redissolved in 1 ml of hexane. Lipids were separated by chromatography on Kieselgel 60 (Merck) silica TLC plates developed in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v). The cholesterol band was scraped off, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Mevalonate incorporations were carried out as described (14Mayer R.J. Adams J.L. Bossard M.J. Berkhout T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20070-20078Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 µM SR-12813 was added to the cells 20 min before the addition of [3H]mevalonic acid lactone (0.2 µCi/nmol; final concentration, 100 µM), and cells were incubated for 2 h. Cells were saponified in 2 M NaOH/65% ethanol, and [14C]cholesterol (about 2500 dpm) was added to each tube as a recovery marker. Nonsaponifiable lipids were three times extracted from the aqueous phase with hexane. The lipids were redissolved in 150 µl of hexane and analyzed on 20 × 5-cm silica TLC plates developed in hexane/diethylether (1:1). Iodine was used to stain the marker lipids. Bands that aligned with the marker cholesterol were scraped from the plate and counted. HMG-CoA reductase activity was measured essentially as described (24Berkhout T.A. Havekes L.M. Pearce N.J.

HMG-CoA reductase activity in the cell lysate was further determined as described (24Berkhout T.A. Havekes L.M. Pearce N.J. Groot P.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 181-186Google Scholar). Protein levels of HMG-CoA reductase were determined by immunoblot analysis. 6-well Costar plates containing confluent Hep G2 cells were pre-incubated overnight in 5% LPDS medium. For some experiments 0.1 µM lovastatin was included overnight. Cells were incubated with 5 µM SR-12813 in 0.1% Me2SO. After the period of incubation, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM EGTA. Then 300 µl of lysing buffer was added to each well. Lysing buffer consisted of the above buffer with the following added: 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM N-ethyl maleimide, 2.2% Me2SO, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM leupeptin (28van Driel I.R. Davis G.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16127-16134Google Scholar). Lysed cells were homogenized using a 1-ml syringe with and 21 gauge needle. After being on-ice for 10 min, the samples were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 5 min. To 300 µl of supernatant, 900 µl of sample buffer was added. The sample buffer consisted of 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 2% SDS (w/v), 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue. Samples were immediately loaded onto a 20 × 16-cm casted gel containing 7.5% acrylamide, 0.375 M Tris, pH 8.8, 0.1% SDS (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). For unknown reasons heating of the samples results in the disappearance of the 98-kDa HMG-CoA reductase band and the formation of a band with twice the molecular mass, apparently a dimer. This anomaly has also been observed by other authors (30Hardeman E.C. Jenke H.S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 80: 1516-1520Google Scholar). BCA (Pierce) protein assay reagent was used to determine protein concentrations. Proteins were blotted onto a fluorotran membrane using 0.025 M Tris-HCl, 0.192 M glycine, 20% methanol as the transfer buffer using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Biometra). The membrane was blocked with 0.5% casein in PBS overnight at 4°C while shaking. Rabbit antibody to human HMG-CoA reductase catalytic subunit (HR 58 (14Mayer R.J. Adams J.L. Bossard M.J. Berkhout T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20070-20078Google Scholar)) was diluted 2500 times in 0.1% casein and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After four washes each for 5 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, membrane was washed in PBS. The secondary antibody (rabbit Ig, horseradish peroxidase-linked F(ab′)2 from donkey) was diluted 10,000 times in 0.1% casein in PBS. This was incubated for 1 h at room temperature before washing four times with 0.1% Triton X-100. The membrane was finally washed in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. Proteins were detected using the ECL detection reagents and exposed to Hyperfilm ECL. Bands on the fluorographs were analyzed by densitometry using a video image system that was calibrated with a photographic step tablet (Kodak) and the Optimas image analysis program. Using HR 58 it was determined that the density on the Western blots increased linearly with the protein concentration up to an optical density of 2. Degradation rates of HMG-CoA reductase in Hep G2 cells were basically determined according to Edwards (31Edwards P.A. Lan S.F. Tanaka R.D. Fogelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7272-7275Google Scholar). Experiments were set up in a staggered fashion such that all chases were terminating at the same time. Cells were preincubated in 5% LPDS medium overnight in 6-well plates. Cells were pre-incubated for 15 min with 1.5 ml/well methionine-free 5% LPDS medium made to pH 7.0 before 40 µCi of [35S]methionine was included for 1 h. Under our experimental conditions, methionine incorporations into protein were linear for at least 2 h (not shown). Methionine-free medium was then replaced with 2 mM methionine, 5% LPDS medium, and compound (final concentration, 0.1% Me2SO). The cells were incubated for a further 0–3 h before all reactions were terminated at the same time. Cells were solubilized in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA (32Gillespie J.G. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 59-62Google Scholar). The following protease inhibitors were added just before the experiment to the final concentration indicated; 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mM leupeptin, 0.1 mM 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 0.1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mM tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (16Clarke P.R. Hardie D.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2439-2446Google Scholar). The samples were homogenized using a syringe and a 21 gauge needle before being left on ice for 10 min and then spun in a microfuge for 5 min. To measure the incorporation of [35S]methionine into the total protein fraction, two times 5 µl of the supernatant was mixed with 100 µl of 10 mg/ml BSA, followed by 1 ml of ice-cold 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation (table centrifuge, 10 min, 4°C). The pellet was dissolved in 0.1 ml of distilled water and 2 ml of Soluene 350; 10 ml of Hionic Fluor (Packard) was then added for counting. The remaining supernatant containing the solubilized protein was incubated with 10 µl of rabbit anti-HR53 or with 10 µl of rabbit nonimmune serum on ice for 1 h. 40 µl of protein A-agarose were then added to the samples and incubated overnight at 4°C on an rotary shaker. After a 20-s centrifugation, the immune complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer (no protease inhibitors). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of 150 µl of 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, and 62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8. The protein A beads were pelleted by a 20-s spin in a Eppendorf microfuge. Samples were immediately separated by electrophoresis in the presence of SDS (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) on 16 × 20-cm casted gels containing 7.5% acrylamide. Gels were stained and processed for fluorography using Amplify (Amersham Corp.). Bands on the fluorographs were analyzed as described in the HMG-CoA reductase assays section. Measurement of LDL receptor-dependent association and degradation of LDL was basically as described previously (24Berkhout T.A. Havekes L.M. Pearce N.J. Groot P.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 181-186Google Scholar). Briefly, Hep G2 cells were incubated with 5% LPDS medium in the presence of SR-12813, lovastatin (free acid), or 0.1% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxide (control). The cells were incubated for 16 h. The medium was removed, 300 µl of 125I-LDL (10 µg/ml, 53 cpm/ng) was added, and incubation continued for 2.5 h. At the end of the incubation, 250 µl of the medium was collected, and the cells were washed at 0°C six times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 1 mM CaCl2 and once with PBS only. Cells were dissolved into 0.2 N NaOH, and cellular protein was measured. The radioactive content of the samples was determined and used as a measure for association of LDL. For degradation, bovine serum albumin, trichloroacetic acid, and AgNO3 (final concentrations, 0.2%, 0.5 M, and 0.115 M, respectively) were added to the medium samples to precipitate 125I-LDL and free iodide (33Wilkins G.M. Leake D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 69-78Google Scholar). The degradation product from 125I-LDL, iodotyrosine, remained in the supernatant and was counted. Nonspecific 125I-LDL association and degradation were determined by including 300 µg/ml of unlabeled LDL in the experiment (1 well/dose). Hep G2 cells on a 6-well plate were incubated with either 1 µM lovastatin or 3 µM SR-12813 in 5% LPDS medium. mRNA was isolated using a Fast-track kit (Invitrogen). mRNAs were analyzed as described (23Knight B.L. Patel D.D. Gavigan S.J.P. Soutar A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 555-561Google Scholar). Briefly, mRNAs were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel. RNA was transferred to Biodyne A nylon membrane by capillary blotting using 20 × SSC and fixed to the membrane by UV light. Blots were prehybridized for 15 min at 68°C in 200 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 1% w/v BSA, 7% SDS, and 15% deionized formamide (v/v) and then hybridized for 18–20 h at 68°C in the same buffer containing the 32P-labeled cDNA probes. Blots were washed at 68°C in 40 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 1% SDS (w/v). Autoradiographs were scanned with a Joyce-Loebl chromoscan III densitometer. To measure the effects of SR-12813 on sterol synthesis Hep G2 cells were incubated with different radiolabeled precursors, and incorporation of radioactivity into cholesterol was determined. SR-12813 inhibited the incorporation of 3H2O into cholesterol in Hep G2 cells (Fig. 2A) with an IC50 of 1.2 µM. A similar inhibition with an IC50 of 0.6 µM was found when [14C]acetate was used instead of 3H2O (Fig. 2A). There were no effects of SR-12813 on the incorporation of 3H2O into fatty acids. Incorporation of [3H]mevalonic acid lactone into cholesterol was not influenced in the presence of SR-12813 (Fig. 2B) nor into squalene and farnesol. 3T. A. Berkhout, H. M. Simon, and K. E. Suckling, unpublished results. In good agreement with this finding, the sterol profile of the nonsaponifiable lipid fraction from Hep G2 cells treated for 16 h with SR-12813 showed no increase in any of the sterol intermediates (not shown, but similar to sterol profile of control in 34Albrightson C.R. Bugelski P.J. Berkhout T.A. Jackson B. Kerns W.D. Organ A.J. Badger A.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 272: 689-698Google Scholar). These data indicate that SR-12813 interferes with the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway at the level of one of the enzymatic conversions between acetyl-CoA and mevalonate but not beyond HMG-CoA reductase. Exposure of Hep G2 cells to SR-12813 inhibited cellular HMG-CoA reductase activity with an apparent IC50 of 0.85 µM (Fig. 3A). This agreed well with the IC50 of 1.2 µM found for the inhibition of 3H2O incorporation into cholesterol shown in Fig. 2A. Inhibition of 50% of the activity was achieved in 10 min (Fig. 3B). At concentrations of 5 µM SR-12813, the maximum inhibition was 80% of the initial activity, and inhibition lasted for periods of 24 h or more (see also Fig. 2A). No direct effect of SR-12813 on the activity of HR 58, the cloned catalytic subunit of human HMG-CoA reductase (14Mayer R.J. Adams J.L. Bossard M.J. Berkhout T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20070-20078Google Scholar), at concentrations of SR-12813 of up to 0.5 mM was observed nor on the activity of Hep G2 cellular extracts (10 µM). These data indicate that the activity of HMG-CoA reductase is strongly suppressed in the presence of SR-12813 in cells but that there is no direct inhibition. HMG-CoA reductase can be inactivated via an AMP kinase-mediated phosphorylation (16Clarke P.R. Hardie D.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2439-2446Google Scholar). We investigated if SR-12813 inactivated HMG-CoA reductase via an increased phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase. The HMG-CoA reductase activity assay is routinely performed in the presence of fluoride to give the “expressed activity” (27Kennelly P.J. Rodwell V.W. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 903-914Google Scholar), which represents the activity of HMG-CoA reductase in the cell. When fluoride is omitted, phosphorylated, mostly inactive, HMG-CoA reductase is dephosphorylated by phosphatases to yield total activity. Under these conditions HMG-CoA reductase activity was still decreased by SR-12813 (Fig. 3B). HMG-CoA reductase activity in controls increased about 3-fold from 48 to 132 pmol/min/mg cellular protein, showing that reductase was indeed reactivated in our experimental conditions. This finding indicated that SR-12813 did not increase phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase. HMG-CoA reductase has also been reported to be inactivated by oxidation (17Ness G.C. McCreery M.J. Sample C.E. Smith M. Pendleton L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16395-16399Google Scholar, 18Omkumar R.V. Ramasarma T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1156: 267-274Google Scholar). We hypothesized SR-12813 might oxidize HMG-CoA reductase and that dithiothreitol, which is a standard constituent of the HMG-CoA reductase activity assay, might protect the reductase from oxidation. No inactivation of HR 58 reductase activity by SR-12813 was observed under nonreducing conditions when dithiothreitol was omitted from the assay.3 LDL receptor activity and HMG-CoA reductase activity are co-ordinately regulated in Hep G2 cells (24Berkhout T.A. Havekes L.M. Pearce N.J. Groot P.H. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 181-186Google Scholar, 35Molowa D.T. Cimis G.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 731-736Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of SR-12813 on LDL receptor activity by measuring the receptor-mediated association of 125I-LDL with the cells over a period of 2.5 h. Lovastatin was used as a positive control (35Molowa D.T. Cimis G.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 731-736Google Scholar, 36Cohen L.H. Griffioen M. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 61-67Google Scholar). In overnight incubations both lovastatin and SR-12813 enhanced the receptor-mediated association of iodinated LDL with Hep G2 cells (Table I). This was not the result of a decreased catabolism of LDL because LDL receptor-mediated degradation of 125I-LDL was also increased (Table I) in the presence of lovastatin or SR-12813. This result shows that the suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity by SR-12813 results in an increase of LDL receptor activity.Table I.Effect of SR-12813 on LDL receptor activity in Hep G2 cellsAssociation ± S.D.Degradation ± S.D.% of control0.05 µM lovastatin127 ± 12aNot significantly different from controls.150 ± 280.15 µM lovastatin144 ± 10158 ± 220.5 µM lovastatin163 ± 15189 ± 253 µM SR-12813165 ± 7172 ± 1510 µM SR-12813223 ± 5254 ± 18a Not significantly different from controls. Open table in a new tab The increase in LDL receptor activity might result from regulation at the transcriptional level. Similarly HMG-CoA reductase expression might be regulated by SR-12813. We studied the effect of SR-12813 on mRNA content of HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin that is known to increase mRNA levels of HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor (35Molowa D.T. Cimis G.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 731-736Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. After a 21-h incubation with SR-12813 or lovastatin, mRNA content of both of these proteins were increased (Fig. 4) in comparison with the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-diphosphate dehydrogenase. There were no short term effects (1–4 h) on expression of mRNA of either protein (not shown). It is concluded that SR-12813 modulates LDL receptor and HMG-CoA reductase at the transcriptional level in a way similar to lovastatin. The rapid suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity by SR-12813 suggests the involvement of a post-transcriptional mechanism. We measured the effect of 5 µM SR-12813 on HMG-CoA reductase protein levels in time by Western blot analysis. To facilitate analysis, HMG-CoA reductase levels were induced severalfold by pre-incubation of the cells overnight with 0.1 µM lovastatin (Fig. 5). Under these conditions, SR-12813 was still able to reduce HMG-CoA reductase activity, although suppression of the reductase activity now had a T1/2 of about 30 min compared with 10 min without lovastatin (Fig. 6). Fig. 5 shows the decay of the HMG-CoA reductase protein levels with time as measured by densitometric analysis of the area corresponding to the 98-kDa band. The T1/2 of HMG-CoA reductase protein reduction appears to be slightly longer (1 h) than that found for suppression of enzyme activity in the presence of lovastatin (30 min, Fig. 6). Without lovastatin HMG-CoA reductase protein levels were reduced about 4-fold in the presence of SR-12813 (Fig. 5).Fig. 6Effect of SR-12813 on HMG-CoA reductase activity in the presence of lovastatin. Confluent Hep G2 cells were pre-incubated overnight in 5% LPDS medium and 100 nM lovastatin. After 16 h of incubation, 5 µM SR-12813 was added for the indicated time. The reaction was then terminated, and HMG-CoA reductase activity was determined. HMG-CoA reductase activity after lovastatin was 230 pmol/min/mg, which was 5-fold increased over controls without lovastatin. The values are shown as the averages of triplicates ± S.D. The curve was drawn using a four parameter free fit, which gave a T1/2 of suppression of reductase activity of 33 min. When fitted as a single exponential decay a T1/2 of 30 min was obtained, but this fit was not as good.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further experiments were performed in order to establish if this decrease in protein levels by SR-12813 was a result"

https://openalex.org/W1990056682,"Herpes simplex virus type 1 encodes a helicase-primase complex composed of the products of the UL5, UL52, and UL8 genes. A subcomplex consisting of the UL5 and UL52 proteins purified from insect cells also displays ATPase, helicase, and primase activities. UL5 contains six motifs conserved in superfamily I of known and/or putative helicase proteins. Consistent with the ability to hydrolyze ATP, motifs I and II resemble a nucleotide binding site. Although the role of the other four motifs is not known, single amino acid substitutions created in conserved residues in all six motifs abolish the ability of UL5 to support viral DNA replication in vivo (Zhu, L., and Weller, S. K. (1992) J. Virol. 66, 469-479). In one such mutation, a highly conserved glycine in motif V (Gly815) is replaced with an alanine. Although the UL5(G815A) protein does not support viral DNA replication in vivo, the purified UL5(G815A)·52 subcomplex retains primase and helicase activities and supports strand displacement DNA synthesis on a preformed replication fork in the presence of the other HSV-1 replication proteins. The major difference between the wild-type and variant protein is that the UL5(G815A)·52 subcomplex displays an increased Km for single-stranded DNA and decreased Kcat for single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity.

K. (1992) J. Virol. 66, 469-479). In one such mutation, a highly conserved glycine in motif V (Gly815) is replaced with an alanine. Although the UL5(G815A) protein does not support viral DNA replication in vivo, the purified UL5(G815A)·52 subcomplex retains primase and helicase activities and supports strand displacement DNA synthesis on a preformed replication fork in the presence of the other HSV-1 replication proteins. The major difference between the wild-type and variant protein is that the UL5(G815A)·52 subcomplex displays an increased Km for single-stranded DNA and decreased Kcat for single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Several hypotheses for the role of motif V in the function of the UL5 helicase in HSV-1 DNA replication are considered. This is the first report of a biochemical analysis of a motif V variant in any member of helicase superfamily I."

INTRODUCTIONDNA topoisomerases are a kind of enzymes which, by changing the topological structure of the DNA by means of transient single (in class I) or double (in class II) stranded breaks, produce different topological forms called topoisomers (1Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 879-910Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-679Google Scholar). These enzymes can easily knot/unknot, catenate/decatenate, and supercoil/relax DNA molecules in vitro (3Liu L.F. Liu C. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1980; 19: 697-707Google Scholar, 4Goto Y. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5866-5872Google Scholar, 5Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Google Scholar, 6Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. Dea M.H. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3872-3876Google Scholar). Their critical role in processes as replication, transcription, recombination, repair, and chromosome condensation have been established in vivo (2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-679Google Scholar, 7Liu L.F. Liu C. Alberts B.M. Nature. 1979; 281: 456-461Google Scholar, 8Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6659-6662Google Scholar, 9Adachi Y. Luke M.

Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 523-533Google Scholar); this bacterial enzyme falls into the class I. The class II-enzyme bacterial gyrase is, until now, the only topoisomerase capable to introduce negative supercoiling over a covalently closed relaxed DNA in an ATP-driven process (6Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. Dea M.H. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3872-3876Google Scholar, 12Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2098-2102Google Scholar, 13Sugino A. Bott K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 1331-1339Google Scholar).A broad range of organisms and sources, including viruses, show activities that change the topological state of the DNA. Concomitantly with the fact of breaking and rejoining one or two strands in the DNA molecule, topoisomerases II change the linking number in steps of two (3Liu L.F. Liu C. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1980; 19: 697-707Google Scholar, 14Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8413-8420Google Scholar), whereas class I alters this topological parameter in steps of one (15Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 449-479Google Scholar).Knotting of either single or double stranded DNA rings can be carried out by both classes of topoisomerases (3Liu L.F. Liu C. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1980; 19: 697-707Google Scholar, 14Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8413-8420Google Scholar, 16Liu L.F. Depew R.E. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 106: 439-452Google Scholar) by breaking and rejoining one or two strands. The ATP dependence on the knotting activity is controversial: topoisomerase II knotting of circular duplex DNA, using purified enzyme from Drosophila embryos, is greatly enhanced by ATP (14Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8413-8420Google Scholar). However, topoisomerase II from T4 bacteriophage can knot either covalently closed or nicked DNA rings without ATP (3Liu L.F. Liu C. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1980; 19: 697-707Google Scholar, 17Wasserman S.A. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20567-20573Google Scholar). Nevertheless, either the viral or the eukaryotic enzyme require in the presence of ATP or not, to be present in larger amounts (3Liu L.F. Liu C. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1980; 19: 697-707Google Scholar, 14Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8413-8420Google Scholar, 17Wasserman S.A. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20567-20573Google Scholar, 18Roca J. Berger J.M. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14250-14255Google Scholar) than necessary to achieve DNA relaxation (4Goto Y. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5866-5872Google Scholar, 5Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Google Scholar).Recently, an ATP-dependent enzymatic mechanism for yeast topoisomerase II has been reported (19Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Google Scholar, 20Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Google Scholar; reviewed in 21Roca J. Trends Biochem. 1995; 20: 156-160Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme, a homodimer of a 170-kDa polypeptide (4Goto Y. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5866-5872Google Scholar), forms an open clamp which traps a DNA duplex; then, a second DNA duplex enters the open gate, which is closed when ATP is bound to the protein. Simultaneously to the double strand breakage of the first DNA duplex, the second duplex crosses the break and exits through a second protein gate opposite to the entrance gate. The process finishes after the resealing of the broken duplex, which exits through the first gate depending on ATP hydrolysis. As class II DNA topoisomerases are evolutionary related, the mechanism reported can be extensive to all such enzymes.In this study I show that the eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae can efficiently knot any topologically closed DNA template, either relaxed or supercoiled. This ATP-driven reaction depends on the addition of stoichiometric amounts of enzyme. When topoisomerase II is employed at a catalytic level, both unknotting and relaxing activities over knotted or supercoiled DNA templates are achieved.Finally, the addition of the cell-free extract S-150, capable of assembly of chromatin over any topologically linked DNA template (22Shimamura A. Jessee B. Worcel A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 170: 603-612Google Scholar, 23Shimamura A. Tremethick D. Worcel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4257-4269Google Scholar), fails to form periodically arranged nucleosomes when the DNA template is knotted. Nonetheless, a pretreatment with trace amounts of topoisomerase II before the onset of the chromatin assembly process permits the nucleosome formation over knotted DNA. These results suggest that DNA topoisomerase II may modulate, via knotting/unknotting, the assembly of chromatin.RESULTSWhen a relaxed pUC19 plasmid DNA was incubated with increasing amounts of yeast topoisomerase II and the extensively deproteinized samples were electrophoretically resolved, an emergent distribution of bands with progressively higher mobilities appears (Fig. 1). At topoisomerase II/DNA mass ratio of 1–2, the head of this ladder runs faster than the covalently closed, supercoiled DNA (Fig. 1, lanes 4, 5, and 7), showing a higher compactness. According to previous results (3Liu L.F. Liu C. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1980; 19: 697-707Google Scholar, 17Wasserman S.A. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20567-20573Google Scholar), each rung of the ladder corresponds to a knot with a different number of crosses (nodes). It is noteworthy that poor staining was shown by knots with a high number of crosses when ethidium bromide was employed; on the opposite, this effect does not appear when a radiolabeled probe was used instead of the colorant. Likely, the high degree of compaction can act as a barrier for the dye intercalation (compare Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4).Fig. 4Time course analysis of knotting with relaxed and supercoiled DNA. 200 ng of both relaxed (lane 12) or supercoiled (lane 6) pUC19 were knotted with topoisomerase II as described. At the indicated times, one-sixth of the mixture, containing about 30 ng of DNA, was removed and the reaction stopped by addition of 2.5% Sarkosyl, 100 mM EDTA. Samples were deproteinized and the purified DNA was resolved in 1% agarose-TBE gel, blotted, and hybridized with a pUC19 probe.

A, 1 µg of covalently closed relaxed pUC19 was knotted as described under “Materials and Methods.” After careful purification, the DNA sample was electrophoresed in 1% agarose-TBE gel at 65 V during 16 h, soaked in the running buffer with 1.4 µM chloroquine for 6–8 h, shifted 90° from its original position, and re-electrophoresed in the second dimension for 16 h at 65 V, blotted to a filter, and hybridized with a pUC19 probe.

Knotted DNA (100 ng) was incubated, in two separate reactions, with either commercial topoisomerase I from calf thymus (10 units/µl) or yeast topoisomerase II (10 units/µl) together with 100 ng of supercoiled SV40 DNA as internal control of relaxation. After incubation, the samples were deproteinized and the DNA was purified and electrophoresed in 1% agarose-TBE gel. After running, the gel was blotted and hybridized with a SV40-pUC19 radiolabeled probe. Lane 1, supercoiled SV40 DNA; lane 2, relaxed pUC19 DNA; lane 3, knotted pUC19 DNA; lane 4, supercoiled SV40 DNA + knotted pUC19 DNA after topoisomerase I treatment; lane 5, the same mixture as in lane 4 but after relaxation with topoisomerase II; lane 6, supercoiled pUC19 DNA. I, II, and III denotes the supercoiled, nicked, and linear forms of each DNA, respectively. Bracket depicts the position of knots. Observe that only topoisomerase II is able to unknot double stranded DNA whereas both topoisomerases I and II relax the DNA with equal efficiency.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Under these experimental conditions, the knotting reaction is strictly dependent on ATP since in its absence, I did not obtain a detectable presence of those DNA forms (not shown), in good agreement with previous data (14Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8413-8420Google Scholar).The topological state of the knots was further assessed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (24Peck L.J. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6206-6210Google Scholar). Electrophoresis in the second dimension was carried out after the equilibration of the gel in the electrophoresis buffer containing chloroquine. Fig. 2 illustrates the two-dimensional electrophoresis for knotted pUC19 DNA. Several sets of spots can be distinguished. The topoisomers are resolved as discrete spots along a regular curve (depicted with asterisks in the scheme of Fig. 2B) while knots display two different distributions, a perfect diagonal containing the nicked population of knots (18Roca J. Berger J.M. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14250-14255Google Scholar) and a curved distribution which corresponds to the covalently closed knots (diagrammed as dark and white circles, respectively, in Fig. 2B). Both distributions converge at the right end of the diagonal because the capability of the chloroquine to discriminate between both nicked and covalently closed knot distributions decreases progressively as their node number increases.In order to gain further insight into the characterization of knots, I performed the experiment shown in Fig. 3, where equal amounts of knotted pUC19 DNA (Fig. 3, lane 3) were treated in two different reactions with topoisomerase I and II under the experimental conditions described (see “Materials and Methods”) together with supercoiled SV40 DNA (Fig. 3, lane 1) added at the onset of the reaction as relaxation internal control. Both topoisomerase I and II were working properly, since their were able to relax the negatively supercoiled SV40 DNA (Fig. 3, lanes 4 and 5, respectively). However, while topoisomerase II can relax the supercoiled SV40 DNA and untie the knotted pUC19, topoisomerase I is able to relax the internal control but fails to unknot the knotted pUC19. These results exclude the possibility that any topological form other than knots might have been formed when topoisomerase II and circular DNA were incubated at a mass ratio close to 1.Previous data have suggested that knotting formation using T4 bacteriophage topoisomerase II requires a supercoiled DNA as substrate rather than the nicked or relaxed forms (3Liu L.F. Liu C. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1980; 19: 697-707Google Scholar, 17Wasserman S.A. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20567-20573Google Scholar). However, with large amounts of topoisomerase II from Drosophila embryos, knotted DNA can be generated over either covalently closed circular DNA or its nicked, relaxed form (14Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8413-8420Google Scholar). Fig. 4 displays the topological forms observed during the time course of two different knotting reactions with relaxed (Fig. 4, lanes 1–5 and lane 12, relaxed substrate before the knotting reaction) or supercoiled (Fig. 4, lanes 7–11 and lane 6, supercoiled substrate before the knotting reaction) pUC19 DNA. Knot formation is very fast; in the experiment shown in Fig. 4, the earliest sampling, 15 min after the onset of the reaction, already shows a knot ladder almost undistinguishable from samples removed after longer incubation times, especially over the relaxed template rather than those obtained over the supercoiled form. A small, but significant, amount of supercoiled DNA appears to be resistant to knotting even after 4 h of incubation (Fig. 4, lane 11). It should be noted that the knot formation over supercoiled DNA is as fast as over the relaxed form. Moreover, partially supercoiled DNA topoisomers are not seen (see Fig. 4, lanes 6–11), suggesting that supercoils become knots in one step without relaxed intermediates (see “Discussion”).Extracts from Xenopus eggs and oocytes can form regularly spaced nucleosomes on circular, topologically linked DNA in an ATP-driven process (22Shimamura A. Jessee B. Worcel A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 170: 603-612Google Scholar, 23Shimamura A. Tremethick D. Worcel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4257-4269Google Scholar, 25Glikin G. Ruberti I. Worcel A. Cell. 1984; 37: 33-41Google Scholar, 26Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Morris N.R. Cell. 1977; 10: 237-243Google Scholar): when a relaxed DNA is added to those extracts it becomes supercoiled concomitantly to the assembly of nucleosomes (25Glikin G. Ruberti I. Worcel A. Cell. 1984; 37: 33-41Google Scholar, 27Germond J.E. Hirt B. Oudet P. Gross-Bellard M. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1843-1847Google Scholar). Thus, the measurement of the superhelix density reflects the actual number of nucleosomes loaded on the DNA ring (26Laskey R.A. Mills A.D. Morris N.R. Cell. 1977; 10: 237-243Google Scholar).To test if the knotted DNA could assemble periodically arranged nucleosomes, equal amounts of either relaxed or knotted (but containing a fraction of relaxed DNA) pUC19 DNA were incubated in two separated chromatin assembly reactions with the cell-free extract from Xenopus oocytes S-150. Fig. 5 depicts the topological changes during the time. While both relaxed (Fig. 5, lanes 1–6) and unknotted (relaxed) fraction contained in the knotted mixture (Fig. 5, lanes 9–14, white circles) become progressively supercoiled by nucleosome loading, the knotted DNA (white dashes), which runs electrophoretically in between the topoisomers and remains unaltered after the assembly process. The experiment addresses how the knotted fraction is resistant to assembly but does not inhibit this process over the unknotted (relaxed) fraction.It is remarkable the very low levels of endogenous topoisomerase II activity detected in crude oocyte extracts which is pelleted during the preparation of the S-150 (23Shimamura A. Tremethick D. Worcel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4257-4269Google Scholar, 28Liu L.F. Davis J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3979-3989Google Scholar, 29Zucker K. Worcel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14487-14496Google Scholar) and, in contrast, the strong topoisomerase I activity of this extract which relaxes completely in a few minutes after a supercoiled DNA exogenously was added at the beginning of the chromatin assembly; over this endogenously relaxed template occurs the nucleosome deposition, giving a negatively supercoiled DNA after the deproteinization of the sample (not shown) (25Glikin G. Ruberti I. Worcel A. Cell. 1984; 37: 33-41Google Scholar and references therein).An additional question is whether the negative effect of knotted DNA substrate on chromatin assembly could be reversed or not by untying the template with trace amounts of topoisomerase II immediately before the addition of the S-150. Fig. 6 (top) depicts the design of the experiment. Supercoiled pUC19 DNA was knotted by means of stecheometric amounts of topoisomerase II under standard conditions; the deproteinized sample was then divided into two halves and incubated at 30°C for 1 h in two different reactions, either with a trace amount of topo II or, in a mock incubated reaction, with buffer alone before the addition of the S-150. Six hours later, the chromatin assembly products were processed for both topological and micrococcal nuclease digestion analysis. Pretreatment with catalytic amounts of topoisomerase II prior to the assembly process can reverse the inability of the knotted DNA template (Fig. 6, lane 3) to assemble nucleosomes as revealed both by its topological state (Fig. 6, lane 8) and the presence of a series of DNA fragments which are multiples of approximately 160–170 base pairs (Fig. 6, lanes 9–11) obtained upon partial micrococcal nuclease digestion. In contrast, the topoisomerase II mock-incubated half (Fig. 6, lane 4) shows, after the micrococcal nuclease digestion, a mixture of DNA fragments without a clear nucleosomal periodicity (Fig. 6, lanes 5–7). This pattern of bands may be explained by the partial assembly over the unknotted species contained in the knotted mixture (see Fig. 5). It should also be noted the higher sensitivity against the micrococcal nuclease digestion shown by the topoisomerase II mock-incubated reaction (compare Fig. 6, lanes 6 and 10) which, again, reveals the assembly only over the unknotted template. Therefore, the previous untying of knotted DNA template seems to be critical for the correct nucleosome loading.DISCUSSIONIn this paper I show how the topoisomerase II from S. cerevisiae can introduce knots in a plasmidic DNA when the reaction is performed at an enzyme/DNA mass ratio equal or higher than 1, always in the presence of ATP. This process needs a topologically linked DNA substrate regardless its form.DNA knotting, topoisomerase class II-mediated, has been described by means of purified enzymes from T4 bacteriophage (3Liu L.F. Liu C. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1980; 19: 697-707Google Scholar, 17Wasserman S.A. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20567-20573Google Scholar), Drosophila (14Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8413-8420Google Scholar), and yeast (18Roca J. Berger J.M. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14250-14255Google Scholar). In those cases knotting is achieved at an enzyme/DNA mass ratio quite higher than necessary to produce relaxation/unknotting/decatenation reactions (5Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Google Scholar, 14Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8413-8420Google Scholar, 18Roca J. Berger J.M. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14250-14255Google Scholar). Under the experimental conditions described in this paper, I estimate that about 15 molecules of topoisomerase II per pUC19 DNA molecule are needed to produce a highly compacted knotting, while in the relaxation reaction using topoisomerase II from Drosophila one molecule of enzyme, working in a processive fashion, can relax about 15 molecules of supercoiled DNA (5Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Google Scholar). Two different conditions have been found to promote the knotting production by both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes. The knotting process requires ATP hydrolysis or the addition of a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP such as AMPPNP 1The abbreviation used is: AMPPNP5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. when a eukaryotic enzyme is employed (14, 18 and this report) but not when the T4 enzyme is used (3Liu L.F.

Furthermore, whereas the eukaryotic enzyme can operate over a DNA ring regardless of its topological form, the viral enzyme knots DNA with a linking number deficit much more efficiently (17Wasserman S.A. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20567-20573Google Scholar).It has been suggested that the juxtaposition of the DNA helices in the plectonemic supercoiling is the general feature for the spatial recognition of the DNA topology by topoisomerases (3Liu L.F. Liu C. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1980; 19: 697-707Google Scholar, 14Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8413-8420Google Scholar, 30Zechiedrich E.L. Osheroff N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4555-4562Google Scholar). In addition, yeast topoisomerase II promotes the stabilization of crossings of DNA duplexes, acting as a barrier for the relaxation with topoisomerase I and, on the other hand, promoting the knotting formation strongly over several topological forms (18Roca J. Berger J.M. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14250-14255Google Scholar). Therefore, the finding that the enzyme can form knots over DNA rings without any superstructure (see Fig. 4) may account for the ability of topoisomerase II to promote those crosses if the DNA molecule is wrapped around the enzyme as in the DNA-bacterial gyrase complexes observed in vitro (31Klevan L. Wang J.C. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5229-5234Google Scholar, 32Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. Cell. 1981; 23: 721-729Google Scholar, 33Kirchhausen T. Wang J.C. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1985; 41: 933-943Google Scholar).Knots have several well defined characteristics: 1) they show the highest compactation degree as revealed by their electrophoretic mobilities: the knots containing more nodes run electrophoretically ahead of the supercoiled form (Figs. 1, 3, 4, and 6). 2) In part because of its compactness, the knots are less well stained than the other topological forms when ethidium bromide is employed; nonetheless, when a radiolabeled probe was used instead of ethidium bromide such differences were not observed (compare Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4). 3) Two-dimensional gel analysis displays the peculiar electrophoretic mobility shown by the nicked knots, which run in diagonal. When the second dimension is performed in the presence of chloroquine, a curved distribution of covalently closed knots appears converging to the tip of the diagonal, as the number of crosses increases (18Roca J. Berger J.M. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14250-14255Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). 4) The knots can only be untied, without endonucleolytic linearization, by topoisomerase II at a enzyme/DNA ratio much lower than the necessary for the knotting formation and in the presence of 150 mM KCl (data not shown).Under the experimental conditions reported here, the level of KCl is critical: the knotting process requires low levels of KCl (20 mM) probably because the high ionic strength (150 mM) can affect, by shielding of charged groups, the binding between the DNA and the large number of topoisomerase II molecules required to produce knots (18Roca J. Berger J.M. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14250-14255Google Scholar). In the relaxation/unknotting/decatenation processes, where the enzyme must be present at a catalytic level, this effect is present at a lesser extent. The increase of the ionic strength alters the nature of the relaxation reaction from processive to distributive by changing the binding rate between DNA and the topoisomerase II from Drosophila (5Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Google Scholar). This could explain the different requirements of KCl observed for both relaxation and knotting process.Time course analyses over either relaxed or supercoiled DNA show that after 15 min of incubation the knotting distribution is already the same as observed 4 h later, especially when the substrate is a covalently closed relaxed DNA (Fig. 4, lanes 1–5). The knotting over negatively supercoiled DNA occurs without detectable DNA relaxation (Fig. 4, lanes 7–11), and is easily distinguishable in well resolved gels, because the knots (Fig. 4, asterisks) migrate between the topoisomers (Fig. 4, white circles), according to other reports (3Liu L.F. Liu C. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1980; 19: 697-707Google Scholar, 14Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8413-8420Google Scholar).When the knotting is carried out on supercoiled DNA, a small fraction keeps this topological form throughout the time. It could be explained by considering a potentially very short step of relaxed state, which I did not see, between both the supercoiled and the knotted form. Nonetheless, the level of KCl, optimal for knotting but not for relaxation, would explain why such a supercoiled fraction does not reach the knotted state (Fig. 4, lanes 7–11).By using the cell-free extract S-150 from Xenopus oocytes as an in vitro chromatin assembly system (22Shimamura A. Jessee B. Worcel A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 170: 603-612Google Scholar, 23Shimamura A. Tremethick D. Worcel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4257-4269Google Scholar) is shown by means of both topological and micrococcal nuclease digestion analysis that the knotted DNA is the only topologically linked, single ring unable to assemble nucleosomes. Interestingly, the treatment of 800 ng of knotted substrate with 20 ng of topoisomerase II before the onset of the chromatin assembly leads to a competent substrate that allows the ordered deposition of histones in a reaction mixture containing about 400 µg of total protein, and yields a minichromosome undistinguishable from those obtained on competent substrates (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, lanes 8–11). This effect appears to be more dramatic than the observed using the same S-150 system in the remodeling of the minichromosome by the exogenous addition of histone H1 (34Rodríguez-Campos A. Shimamura A. Worcel A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 135-150Google Scholar). The knotted species present in the chromatin assembly reaction does not inhibit this process over other unknotted forms; as Fig. 5 shows, the unknotted template reaches progressively a negative supercoiled state in a very similar fashion than that obtained on the relaxed plasmids. In contrast, no nucleosomes are formed over the knotted population.Topoisomerase II is, among the nonhistone proteins, one"

Since ligand-dependent receptor internalization may be the rate-limiting step controlling the duration of IL-2 receptor signaling, a reduction in the receptor internalization rate could contribute to the observed response enhancement for this analog. To evaluate this possibility, we compared the internalization of IL-2 and T51P in three separate assays. While the internalization rate for IL-2 agreed with values determined by others, the internalization of T51P was markedly reduced. The receptor binding rate constants for this analog were only slightly different; thus, altered binding kinetics could not explain the decreased internalization rate. The effects of reduced internalization were also observable in bioassays, where T51P maintained T-cell proliferation for a longer period compared with IL-2.These results indicate that the T51P point mutation reduces the receptor internalization rate compared with IL-2 in a fashion that is independent of the dissociation rate. This analog may represent a new approach to the preparation of cytokine analogs with potentiated agonist and antagonist properties.

Science. 1988; 240: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). For activated T-cells, IL-2 acts through a receptor system (IL-2R) composed of at least three cell-surface subunits: p55 (α-subunit) (2Nikaido T. Shimizu N. Ishida N. Sabe H. Teshigawara K. Maeda M.

These three chains cooperate to generate the high affinity IL-2R complex (Kd≈ 10−11M), whereas the α-chain alone and the β·γc-subunit complex form low affinity (Kd≈ 10−8M) and intermediate affinity (Kd≈ 10−9M) receptor sites, respectively. The α-chain displays no ability to transduce intracellular signals. Rather, it forms a heteromeric complex with the β-subunit that serves to capture IL-2 on the surface of activated T-cells (8Landgraf B.E. Goldstein B. Williams D.P. Murphy J.R. Sana T.R. Smith K.A.

Another early event associated with IL-2 receptor occupancy is ligand-dependent receptor internalization (16Robb R.J. Munck A. Smith K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 154: 1455-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 17Fujii M. Sugamura K. Sano K. Nakai M. Sugita K. Hinuma Y. J. Exp.

Similarly, the intermediate affinity IL-2R (β·γc) can mediate both signaling and internalization (20Smith K.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 397-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21Waldmann T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2681-2684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Robb R.J. Greene W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), while the low affinity IL-2R (α) induces neither function (23Tsudo M. Kozak R.W. Goldman C.K. Waldmann T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9694-9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Some reports suggest that inhibition of IL-2 internalization using anti-receptor antibodies can influence IL-2-dependent cell growth (24Kumar A. Moreau J.L. Gibert M. Theze J. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3680-3684PubMed Google Scholar, 25Duprez V. Ferrer M. Cornet V. Olive D. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1497-1501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, other studies contradict the requirement of internalization for signaling. Kinetic analyses have shown that some early events induced by IL-2 take place very rapidly after addition of IL-2 to cells and peak within 1 or 2 min (26Horak I.D. Gress R.E. Lucas P.J. Horak E.M. Waldmann T.A. Bolen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 27Merida I. Pratt J.C. Gaulton G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Internalization, however, occurs more slowly, with a t1/2 of ~15 min (22Robb R.J. Greene W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 25Duprez V. Ferrer M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13185-13190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of IL-2Rβ apparently affect IL-2 signaling without altering internalization (30Hatakeyama M. Mori H. Doi T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1989; 59: 837-845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Although it is unlikely that internalization is required for signaling, it has been well documented that the internalization of the IL-2·IL-2R complex results in down-regulation of high affinity IL-2 receptors, presumably attenuating IL-2 responsiveness in T-cells (31Duprez V. Cornet V. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12860-12865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endocytosis, as well as biosynthesis, controls the time of residency of receptors on the cell surface (32Smith K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and therefore modulate cellular responsiveness to IL-2. Consequently, inhibition of ligand-dependent receptor internalization should be reflected by changes in biological response. In this study, we report the first example of ligand-induced inhibition of receptor internalization that is not solely due to altered dissociation kinetics. Proteins were generated via cassette mutagenesis on a synthetic IL-2 gene (33Williams D.P. Regier D. Akiyoshi D. Genbauffer F. Murphy J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10453-10467Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and were expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified as described previously (34Chang D.Z. Tasayco M.L. Ciardelli T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 206-211PubMed Google Scholar). All proteins were determined to be homogeneous by reverse-phase HPLC (4.5 × 25-mm duPont NEN Protein Plus C18 column) and monomeric upon HPLC size-exclusion chromatography (4.5 × 25-mm TSK-Gel G3000WXL column; buffer containing 25 mM NaPO4, pH 7.0, and 100 mM KCl). The concentration of purified proteins was determined by UV absorption in 6 M guanidine HCl (ε280 nm = 9.53 × 103) (35Johnson Jr., W.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were isolated from fresh blood by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 200 mML-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated calf serum (56°C, 30 min), 50 µg/ml gentamycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml, as described (36Landgraf B. Cohen F.E. Smith K.A. Gadski R. Ciardelli T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 816-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bioassays were carried out on normal human PBLs, isolated as described above and stimulated with OKT3 monoclonal antibody (Ortho Pharmaceuticals) for 3 days followed by 2 days of incubation in the absence of OKT3 (36Landgraf B. Cohen F.E. Smith K.A. Gadski R. Ciardelli T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 816-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative bioassays were performed on these day 5 human PBLs, with a 48-h incubation in the presence of a full range of ligands as described previously (34Chang D.Z. Tasayco M.L. Ciardelli T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 206-211PubMed Google Scholar). Extended bioassays were performed on the same population of cells with a single protein concentration (EC50). Cells were harvested every 12 h after the regular 48-h incubation period. The biological response was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Purified monomeric recombinant IL-2 and T51P were labeled with Na125I using lactoperoxidase/glucose oxidase as described (37Wang H.M. Smith K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 1055-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 µl of concentrated IL-2 (66.7 µM in 5 mM NH4OAc, pH 5) or T51P analog (40 µM in 25 mM NaH2PO4, pH 4.5) were incubated with 1 mCi of Na125I (100 mCi/ml; Amersham Corp.), 15 µl of 5% glucose, 30 µl of 0.2 M NaPO4, pH 7.0, and Enzymobeads (Bio-Rad) for 5 min following the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was quenched by adding 7.5 µl of 10% NaN3 and 30 µl of 0.1 M unlabeled NaI to terminate the enzymatic activity. An aliquot of 30 µl of 10% fetal calf serum was added to the reaction mixture prior to separation on a Sephadex G-10 column (1-ml syringe) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.8, containing 10% fetal calf serum. The column was eluted with the same buffer. The fractions were collected, and those containing peak radioactivity were pooled. The specific activity was determined by bioassay and expressed as molecules/cpm (38Gillis S. Ferm M.M. Ou W. Smith K.A. J. Immunol. 1978; 121: 2032-2077Google Scholar). Equilibrium receptor binding of 125I-IL-2 and 125I-T51P was performed on activated PBLs after 3 days of OKT3 stimulation as described (8Landgraf B.E. Goldstein B. Williams D.P. Murphy J.R. Sana T.R. Smith K.A. Ciardelli T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the activated PBLs were washed with and preincubated in the metabolic inhibitors 2-deoxy-D-glucose (50 mM) and NaN3 (15 mM) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, containing BSA to reduce ligand internalization (39Steinman R.M. Silver J.M. Cohn Z.A. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 63: 949-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Serial 2-fold dilutions of labeled IL-2 or T51P (beginning at concentrations 10-fold greater than the approximate Kd value) were added to the cell suspensions (2 × 106 cells) and incubated for up to 90 min in the same buffer. Nonspecific binding, assessed by addition of a 400-fold molar excess of unlabeled ligand, was subtracted from all data points. Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined by Scatchard analysis (40Rosenthal H. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 20: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). The results presented are the average of four replicate determinations repeated in two to four independent experiments. To examine the effect of internalization on high affinity IL-2R sites, day 3 activated PBLs were treated with unlabeled IL-2 or T51P (at their Kd concentrations) in regular supplemented RPMI 1640 medium at 37°C for 45 min. As a control for no internalization and for incomplete acid-induced dissociation, an equivalent number of cells were incubated with unlabeled T51P at its Kd concentration at 4°C for 45 min. Cells were then cooled to 4°C and washed twice with ice-cold supplemented RPMI 1640 medium and pelleted. To dissociate surface receptor-bound ligand, the cell pellets were then resuspended in low pH buffer (10 mM citrate, 0.14 M NaCl, and 50 µg/ml BSA, pH 4) and incubated for 3 min at 4°C (22Robb R.J. Greene W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The acid wash was repeated, and the cells were washed twice with cold supplemented RPMI 1640 medium. The number of cell-surface receptors remaining were then determined via radioreceptor binding at 4°C using 125I-IL-2 followed by Scatchard analysis as described above. The binding and internalization of 125I-labeled IL-2 and T51P were performed on PBLs expressing high affinity receptor sites as described (22Robb R.J. Greene W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 1201-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The cells were first incubated for 5 min at 37°C in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 µM chloroquine, a lysosomotropic agent that prevents degradation of internalized proteins (16Robb R.J. Munck A. Smith K.A. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 154: 1455-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 41Robb R.J. Lin Y. Goldstein A.L. Thymic Hormones and Lymphokines. Plenum Press, New York1984: 247Crossref Google Scholar). 125I-IL-2 or 125I-T51P was then added at a final concentration equaling ~10 times the Kd value (160 pM and 1.3 nM for IL-2 and T51P, respectively) and incubated for 30 min at 4°C. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold supplemented RPMI 1640 medium to remove unbound ligand. Internalization was initiated by resuspending cells (107 cells/ml) in prewarmed (37°C) supplemented RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 µM chloroquine. At selected time intervals, 100-µl aliquots of the cell suspension were removed and diluted in 1.2 ml of ice-cold supplemented RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were pelleted, and the radioactivity in the supernatant was measured to determine the amount of 125I-protein that had dissociated from the receptors. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 200 µl of 10 mM citrate, pH 4, containing 0.14 M NaCl and 50 µg/ml BSA. After incubation at 4°C for 3 min, the cells were centrifuged through a 400-µl layer of silicone/paraffin oil. The radioactivity in the cell pellet and that in the supernatant above the oil layer were measured to determine the level of pH 4-resistant (internalized) and pH 4-sensitive (cell surface-bound) protein, respectively. To determine the extent of recycling of internalized ligand, a modification of the assay reported by French et al. (42French A.R. Sudlow G.P. Wiley H.S. Lauffenburger D.A. J. Biol.

Day 3 activated PBLs were washed three times with supplemented RPMI 1640 medium and resuspended at 1 × 107 cells/ml in the same medium containing 125I-IL-2 (48 pM; specific activity = 1,215,000 molecules/cpm) or 125I-T51P (360 pM; specific activity = 201,000 molecules/cpm). A second series of samples were prepared and kept at 4°C throughout the entire assay (non-internalizing conditions) to control for release of ligand bound nonspecifically to the cell surface. Since a significantly greater amount of total radioactivity was employed in the case of T51P, an equivalent sample was prepared containing a large excess of unlabeled ligand (4.8 nM) to determine nonspecific binding. All of the cell samples, except the two internalization-negative controls, were incubated at 37°C for 1 h to allow internalization. All of the samples were cooled to 4°C; washed twice with ice-cold RPMI 1640 medium; and then washed twice with ice-cold 10 mM citrate, pH 4, containing 0.14 M NaCl and 50 µg/ml BSA (after a 3-min incubation) to remove any surface receptor-bound ligand. After two additional washes with ice-cold supplemented RPMI 1640 medium, the cells were resuspended in the same medium at 37°C containing an excess of unlabeled ligand (either 1.6 nM IL-2 or 12 nM T51P) to prevent rebinding of released labeled ligand. At selected time points, 500-µl aliquots (5 × 106 cells) were removed to Eppendorf tubes. and the cells were pelleted. The supernatant was collected, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 500 µl of ice-cold RPMI 1640 medium and pelleted again. The supernatants were combined and counted by solid scintillation to determine the amount of radioactivity released into the medium. The cell pellet was counted to determine the remaining cell-associated radioactivity. To determine the extent of degradation of the labeled ligand released after internalization, 500-µl aliquots of supernatants at selected time points were applied to Sephadex G-10 columns (0.8 × 20 cm) pre-equilibrated in 0.2 M NaPO4, pH 7.0, containing 50 µg/ml BSA. The columns were eluted with the same buffer, and 500-µl fractions were collected and counted. The columns were precalibrated with 125I-IL-2 to determine the elution volume of undegraded ligand. The receptor dissociation kinetics of 125I-labeled IL-2 and T51P were examined on day 3 activated PBLs expressing high affinity receptor sites as described (8Landgraf B.E. Goldstein B. Williams D.P. Murphy J.R. Sana T.R. Smith K.A. Ciardelli T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18511-18519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were preincubated with metabolic internalization inhibitors as described above. All dilutions and subsequent manipulations were made with the same inhibitor buffer used in pretreating the cells. Cells were then incubated in the presence of 125I-IL-2 or 125I-T51P at concentrations ~10 times greater than their Kd values (160 pM and 1.2 nM for IL-2 and T51P, respectively) for 30 min at 37°C. Dissociation was initiated by addition of a 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled ligand. Aliquots (100 µl; 2 × 106 cells) were removed at selected intervals and centrifuged through an oil layer to determine the cell-associated and cell-free radioactivities. Nonspecific binding, determined separately by addition of excess unlabeled ligand during the initial incubation, was subtracted from each determination. Results are the average of two independent experiments, each carried out in triplicate. Dissociation rate constants (koff) were determined from the slopes of lines generated by plotting the natural logarithm of (specific bound molecules/cell)/(maximum specific bound molecules/cell) versus time. The dissociation half-life was determined from the relationship t1/2 = 0.693/koff, where t1/2 is the dissociation half-life and koff is the dissociation rate constant (43Munck A. Pasqualini J.R. Receptors and Mechanisms of Action of Steroid Hormones. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1976: 1Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis of IL-2 and T51P binding to an immobilized heteromeric IL-2 receptor α·β pseudo high affinity complex (IL-2Rαβ·cc) was performed as described (44Wu Z. Johnson K.W. Choi Y. Ciardelli T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16045-16051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SPR instrumentation (BIAcore™), CM5 sensor chips, and amine-coupling reagents containing N-hydroxysuccinimide, N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, and ethanolamine HCl were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Purified IL-2Rαβ·cc complex was diluted to a concentration of ≈30 nM in NaOAc buffer (10 mM), pH 4.5, and coupled to the dextran-modified gold surface of a CM5 sensor chip using the manufacturer's amine coupling chemistry as described in the BIAcore™ systems manual. Surfaces densities of 600-2000 resonance units of IL-2Rαβ·cc complex were employed, and regeneration was achieved by injection of 10 mM HCl (4 µl). Prior to SPR analysis, stock solutions of IL-2 and T51P were dialyzed against phosphate buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl), and the protein concentrations were determined from A280 nm values (34Chang D.Z. Tasayco M.L. Ciardelli T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 206-211PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were then diluted to the desired concentrations in analysis buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% surfactant P-20) containing 100 µg/ml BSA. Five to eight serial dilutions of each protein were injected over the IL-2Rαβ·cc surfaces at a flow rate of 8 µl/min. Sensorgrams were recorded and normalized to a base line of 0 resonance unit. Equivalent volumes of each protein dilution were also injected over an activated and ethanolamine-quenched surface for subtraction of bulk refractive index background. For the determination of dissociation rate constants, analysis buffer containing 1 µM IL-2Rαβ·cc complex was injected during the dissociation phase to minimize rebinding to the biosensor surface. Sensorgrams were analyzed by nonlinear least-squares curve fitting using BIAevaluation 2.1 software (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to yield the apparent kinetic rate constants as described (44Wu Z. Johnson K.W. Choi Y. Ciardelli T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16045-16051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have previously reported point mutations in interleukin-2 analogs that result in apparent signaling abnormalities (34Chang D.Z. Tasayco M.L. Ciardelli T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 206-211PubMed Google Scholar). One of these analogs contains a point mutation at position 51 (Pro for Thr) that produces an enhancement of the biological response. Although this protein has ~10-fold lower receptor binding affinity, it expresses nearly wild-type activity and is thus able to generate a significantly greater biological response than the protein at equivalent receptor occupancy. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism of the apparent facilitation in response observed for the analog T51P. The cDNA encoding the IL-2 analogs was prepared via cassette mutagenesis on a synthetic IL-2 gene as described (33Williams D.P. Regier D. Akiyoshi D. Genbauffer F. Murphy J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10453-10467Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Expression, refolding, and purification of the proteins were carried out using techniques that had been optimized for IL-2 (45Landgraf B.E. Williams D.P. Murphy J.R. Smith K.A. Ciardelli T.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 9: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Purity and aggregation state of all of the analogs were monitored by reverse-phase and size-exclusion HPLC. In all cases, the products were determined to be homogeneous and monomeric at the concentrations employed for the bioassays and receptor binding studies (34Chang D.Z. Tasayco M.L. Ciardelli T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 206-211PubMed Google Scholar). Periodic examination of the aggregation state of stock solutions was performed to check for self-association. For all of the proteins examined, no detectable aggregation was noted upon storage. The apparent anomaly in biological response of T51P when compared with IL-2 was based on a direct comparison of bioactivity (EC50) and receptor affinity (Kd) values of the analog and IL-2 (34Chang D.Z. Tasayco M.L. Ciardelli T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 206-211PubMed Google Scholar). The Kd values were determined from competitive binding assays under steady-state conditions established for IL-2. The validity of the observation is critically dependent upon the accuracy of the values determined for EC50 and Kd. Since this study focused on the relative rates of ligand internalization, it was necessary to radiolabel T51P for these measurements. Employing this labeled ligand in direct equilibrium saturation binding assays should provide independent confirmation of previously determined Kd values. Therefore, we radiolabeled the T51P analog, determined its bioactivity and specific radioactivity, and carried out equilibrium binding analysis on normal human T-cells. The Scatchard analysis of IL-2 compared with the analog T51P is shown in Fig. 1. The Kd values for IL-2 and the analog T51P determined from these data were 13.4 ± 1.4 and 112.3 ± 1.8 pM, respectively. These values are consistent with Kd values previously determined from competitive binding assays (16 and 130 pM) (34Chang D.Z. Tasayco M.L. Ciardelli T.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 206-211PubMed Google Scholar) and further support a facilitated response for T51P. Upon confirmation of Kd values, we investigated the relative internalization rates of the two ligands to help elucidate the possible mechanism of the observed enhancement of the biological response for T51P. Three parameters determine T-cell responsiveness in this system: the concentration of IL-2, the IL-2R density on cells, and the duration of the IL-2R interaction (32Smith K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The density of surface receptors is determined by their rate of synthesis, internalization, and recycling. Internalization, along with ligand dissociation, also determines duration of occupancy of the IL-2R. Although the unliganded IL-2R also undergoes internalization, the rate is rather slow (t1/2 ≈ 1-2 h) (19Duprez V. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15450-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Smith K.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 397-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 31Duprez V. Cornet V. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12860-12865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of IL-2, the IL-2·IL-2R complex is rapidly internalized (t1/2 = 15 min), resulting in a down-regulation of high affinity IL-2 receptors that dampens IL-2 responsiveness in T-cells (31Duprez V. Cornet V. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12860-12865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A response that is enhanced compared with the wild-type ligand could result from longer receptor occupancy due to a reduced rate of internalization of the ligand-bound receptor complex. Therefore, we determined the internalization rate of the T51P analog and compared it with IL-2. The internalization rates of both 125I-IL-2 and 125I-T51P were examined on day 3 PBLs prepared as descr"
https://openalex.org/W2087326842,"Studies of the cysteine proteinases of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum have been aided by a simple acid treatment step that was incorporated into the standard one-dimensional gelatin-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis assay procedure. The step involved immersing the separating gel in 10% (v/v) glacial acetic acid for 30–60 s immediately after electrophoresis. This modified approach revealed the presence of acid-activatable forms of some enzymes with noticeable increases in their ability to hydrolyze gelatin, a substrate present in the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, and peptidyl amidomethylcoumarins. The activation has been analyzed using extracts of dormant spores from which cysteine proteinase activity had previously appeared low or virtually absent. The major acid-activatable proteinase had an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa. Its activation was not due to autocatalysis as it was not prevented by mercuric chloride, an inhibitor of the enzyme, and was not accompanied by a significant change in electrophoretic mobility. It was most likely due to a conformational change and/or the removal of a low molecular weight inhibitor. The acid treatment has also revealed the presence of acid-activatable cysteine proteinases in vegetative cells, in which cysteine proteinase activity is present at high levels, as well as among enzymes from the developmental cells which have much lower cysteine proteinase activity. Indeed novel developmental forms were detected at some stages. These results provide additional insight concerning cysteine proteinase expression at various stages during development in the slime molds.

A developmental model is presented which suggests that the crypticity of the cysteine proteinases in dormant spores may be governed by proton pumps and endogenous lysosomotropic agents. Dictyostelium discoideum possesses multiple forms of cysteine proteinase (ddCP) (1North M.J. Cotter D.A. Dev. Genet. 1991; 12: 154-162Google Scholar) which have been shown to differ from one another during growth (2North M.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 269-275Google Scholar) and development (3North M.J. Scott K.I. Lockwood B.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 261-268Google Scholar). Net cysteine proteinase activity is high in vegetative cells but decreases during the developmental phase (3North M.J. Scott K.I. Lockwood B.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 261-268Google Scholar), partly as a result of secretion (3North M.J. Scott K.I. Lockwood B.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 261-268Google Scholar, 4North M.J. Franek K.J. Cotter D.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 827-833Google Scholar). Consequently, both the stalk cells and the dormant spores that are formed during development possess very low levels of detectable activity; however, some cysteine proteinase activity is found in the extracellular matrix surrounding spores in fruiting bodies (5North M.J. Cotter D.A. Franek K.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 835-840Google Scholar). Net intracellular cysteine proteinase activity returns to appreciable levels during spore germination (5North M.J. Cotter D.A. Franek K.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 835-840Google Scholar). In addition to the cysteine proteinases, D. discoideum also produces an aspartic proteinase (ddAP58) whose level remains relatively constant throughout the life cycle. There are three developmentally regulated genes present in D. discoideum whose sequences indicate that they encode cysteine proteinases. Predicted products of the cprA (CP1) and cprB (CP2) genes have considerable similarity to members of the papain superfamily (6Pears C.J. Mahbubani H. Williams J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8853-8866Google Scholar, 7Williams J.G. North M.J. Mahbubani H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 999-1006Google Scholar), whereas the product of the third gene (CP3) may be a truncated cysteine proteinase (8Presse F. Bogdanovsky-Sequeval D. Mathieu M. Felenbok B. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1986; 203: 333-340Google Scholar). Intriguingly, all three genes are transcribed at times when net cysteine proteinase activity is decreasing, and hence their transcription appears inconsistent with activity levels of the cysteine proteinases detected during various stages of development (1North M.J. Cotter D.A. Dev. Genet. 1991; 12: 154-162Google Scholar). To date, attempts to show a meaningful relationship between the transcription of the developmentally regulated cysteine proteinase genes and the activity levels of the cysteine proteinases recorded during development have been unsuccessful. However, the possibility that gene products may have been present as inactive forms was not examined in detail. Studies of many lysosomal enzymes, including cysteine proteinases, have indicated that the mechanism involved in the production of a mature and active conformation requires the cleavage of a pro-sequence. This cleavage, with mammalian cathepsin L (9Maciewicz R.A. Wardale R.J. Etherington D.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 16: 1056-1057Google Scholar, 10Mason R.W. Gal S. Gottesman M.M. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13030-13035Google Scholar) for example, may be brought about in vitro at acid pH, suggesting that the lower pH of the lysosome may be responsible for triggering activation in vivo. In D. discoideum, comparisons of preprocessed and mature forms of various lysosomal enzymes have indicated molecular weight differences that could be clearly resolved using SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBocN-tert-butoxycarbonylBzN-benzoylCHN2diazomethaneNMec7-(4-methyl)coumarylamideSucN-succinylZN-benzyloxycarbonyl. techniques (14Bush J.M. Cardelli J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7630-7636Google Scholar). It has also been reported that “increasing the lysosomal/endosomal pH from 5.4 to 6.4 with ammonium chloride does not prevent proper sorting of lysosomal hydrolases, but does prevent the cleavage of the lysosomally localized intermediate forms of the enzymes” (15Cardelli J.A. Richardson J.R. Miears D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3454-3463Google Scholar). Thus, it appears plausible that in vivo, the optimal activity of the lysosomal cysteine proteinases might require an acidic pH. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis N-tert-butoxycarbonyl N-benzoyl diazomethane 7-(4-methyl)coumarylamide N-succinyl N-benzyloxycarbonyl. We will describe the conditions required for an in vitro acid activation of the cysteine proteinases in D. discoideum. The results of this work provide information that may relate to the transcriptional and translational events governing the developmentally regulated cysteine proteinase genes in the cellular slime molds and support a proposed model whereby the crypticity of the cysteine proteinases in dormant spores is controlled by proton pumps and endogenous lysosomotropic agents (16Cotter D.A. Sands T.W. Virdy K.J. North M.J. Klein G. Satre M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 892-919Google Scholar). Gelatin (porcine type 1), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-NMec, Z-Phe-Arg-NMec, Bz-Phe-Val-Arg-NMec, Suc-Leu-Tyr-NMec, and Z-Arg-Arg-NMec were obtained from Sigma. E-64 and pepstatin were from Scientific Marketing Associates, Barnet, U. K. H-Leu-Val-Tyr-NMec, Z-Phe-Phe-CHN2, and Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2 were from Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland. All other chemicals used were of the highest purity available from their commercial suppliers. Experiments were performed using D. discoideum strains SG1 (ATCC 44840) and, for axenically grown myxamoebae, AX2 (ATCC 24397). Strain SG1 was grown in the presence of Escherichia coli for spore production (5North M.J. Cotter D.A. Franek K.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 835-840Google Scholar) and in association with Klebsiella aerogenes when myxamoebae and developmental cells were required. Axenic cells of strain AX2 were grown on HL5 medium (2North M.J. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 269-275Google Scholar). Extracts from dormant spores as well as from the late stages of development were prepared by vortexing with glass beads (5North M.J. Cotter D.A. Franek K.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 835-840Google Scholar). Spore casings were obtained from dormant spores by centrifuging at 4,500 × g for 2 min to pellet the glass beads and any spores that remained intact, then centrifuging the supernatant for 2 min at 15,000 × g in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge and resuspending the pelleted spore casings in ice-cold H2O. Cells from all other stages were harvested and lysed with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (4North M.J. Franek K.J. Cotter D.A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 827-833Google Scholar) and then either stored frozen at −20°C or used immediately in experiments. Freezing had no apparent effect on the levels of proteinase activity observed. Proteinases were detected following their electrophoretic separation using the gelatin-SDS-PAGE assay system, which consisted primarily of 10% (w/v) acrylamide mini-gels (0.75 mm) containing 0.2% (w/v) gelatin, Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS (3North M.J. Scott K.I. Lockwood B.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 261-268Google Scholar, 17North M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 523-539Google Scholar). For acid activation, the standard treatment involved immersing the separating gel in 10% (v/v) acetic acid for 30–60 s immediately after the electrophoretic separation was complete and prior to its subsequent washing with 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min. Proteinase bands were then developed by incubating the gel at 25°C for 16 h in acetic acid/sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. Alternatively, proteinase bands were detected with fluorogenic peptidyl amidomethylcoumarins using a modification of the method described previously (17North M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 523-539Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, gelatin was not included in these gels. Following electrophoresis, gels were transferred to 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 20 mM cysteine, either immediately or after a 30-s incubation in 10% (v/v) acetic acid. Gels were incubated for 10 min with one change of buffer and were then transferred to the same buffer containing 0.05 mM substrate. Bands of proteinase activity were recorded as described (17North M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 523-539Google Scholar) during a 60-min incubation at room temperature. When a second electrophoretic separation was required, samples were first run under standard conditions using narrow lanes (15-well comb in the Bio-Rad Mini Protean system). One method involved loading two identical samples in adjacent lanes in the center of the gel and, after electrophoresis, the gels were cut between these two lanes. One section of the gel was treated with 10% (v/v) acetic acid as above. The sections were then washed for 1 min five times in resolving gel buffer (0.375 M Tris HCl, pH 8.8) containing 0.1% (w/v) SDS and then placed between glass plates for the Mini Protean system so that the original sample lanes ran along the top edge of the gel sections from left (top of the original lane) to right (bottom). Gaps were then filled with fresh separating gel mix and electrophoresis continued until the marker dye, added to fresh electrophoresis running buffer, had reached the bottom of the gel. Activity was then detected using the fluorogenic substrate Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-NMec as described above. After activity had been detected the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. An alternative method, used with either gelatin or fluorogenic substrates, involved the following. Samples were run in narrow lanes, as above. After electrophoresis, strips the width of a single lane were cut from the gel, and these were treated, if required, with 10% (v/v) acetic acid for 30 s. Gelatin gels were then incubated with 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min, and all gels were finally immersed in electrophoresis running buffer (0.25 M Tris, 0.192 M glycine, 0.1% (w/v) SDS). Two gel strips were laid horizontally on the top of a new gel so that they covered the gel, and electrophoresis carried out until marker dye had reached the bottom of the gel. Activity was detected as described above. The standard one-dimensional gelatin-SDS-PAGE technique used for analyzing the proteinases present in D. discoideum (3North M.J. Scott K.I. Lockwood B.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 261-268Google Scholar) involves electrophoretic separation of the enzymes in a sample containing 1% (w/v) SDS and 2.5% (v/v) mercaptoethanol, followed by a wash with 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and then incubation of the gel in an appropriate buffer system, usually acetate buffer, pH 4.0, containing a reducing agent such as 1 mM dithiothreitol or 20 mM cysteine. During an analysis of proteinases present in extracts from dormant spores, we found that if this procedure was interrupted by treating the gels briefly in 10% (v/v) acetic acid before washing with Triton X-100, greater activity levels of some proteinase bands were observed. Without this acid treatment step, the major detectable band of activity corresponded to the aspartic proteinase ddAP58 (5North M.J. Cotter D.A. Franek K.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 835-840Google Scholar); minor bands apparently corresponding to cysteine proteinases ddCP48 and ddCP43 were occasionally observed using a 16-h incubation time, depending on the amount of protein loaded. After acid treatment the ddAP58 band was unchanged, but the activity of the cysteine proteinases, especially that corresponding to ddCP48, was greatly enhanced (Fig. 1). Without acid activation, high levels of ddCP48 activity only appeared when heat-activated spores were germinated (5North M.J. Cotter D.A. Franek K.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 835-840Google Scholar) and rarely if germination occurred by autoactivation. All of the activatable proteinases were present at higher levels in extracts from dormant spores than in samples of spore casings (Fig. 1). Some extracellular matrix proteinases (5North M.J. Cotter D.A. Franek K.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 835-840Google Scholar), with apparent molecular masses in the 20–30-kDa range, were also activated by the acid treatment. However, the major enzyme detected in the absence of acid treatment (ddCP18 with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa) had reduced activity after acid treatment (Fig. 1). All of the acid-activated enzymes were cysteine proteinases whose activities were blocked when the specific inhibitors E-64 (28 µM), Z-Phe-Phe-CHN2 (10 µM), or Z-Phe-Ala-CHN2 (10 µM) were included in the acetic acid/sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0 (not shown). Inhibitors of other classes of proteinases (serine, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; aspartic acid, 14 µM pepstatin; metallo-, 1 mM EDTA) were without effect. The activation was due to an in vitro effect on the enzyme and not on the gelatin substrate. When gelatin-containing gels were pretreated with acetic acid, the subsequent band pattern was identical to that obtained with nontreated gelatin gels. In addition, pretreatment of gelatin stock solutions with 10% (v/v) acetic acid, whether in the presence or absence of SDS, did not affect the observed results (data not shown). Confirmation that the effect of the acid was on the enzyme rather than substrate was obtained by using peptidyl amidomethylcoumarins. These were not added until after the acid and subsequent washing steps were completed. Detection of proteinases using these fluorogenic substrates did not necessarily require treatment of the gels with Triton X-100, and gels could simply be washed in phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, before addition of substrate. After acid treatment the same 48-kDa proteinase detected with gelatin as substrate could be seen using Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-NMec (Fig. 2). The presence of gelatin inhibited the activity toward the fluorogenic substrate, an effect that has also been noted with cysteine proteinases from other stages of D. discoideum. 2M. J. North and K. Nicol, unpublished data. For this reason gelatin was routinely omitted from the gels whenever fluorogenic substrates were used. For the 48-kDa proteinase, Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-NMec was the best fluorogenic substrate tested, and the enzyme also hydrolyzed Z-Phe-Arg-NMec well. The enzyme had lower activity toward H-Leu-Val-Tyr-NMec, Bz-Phe-Val-Arg-NMec, and Suc-Leu-Tyr-NMec. No activity was detectable with Z-Arg-Arg-NMec. In its preference for substrates with bulky amino acids at the Pro3 and Pro2 positions and inability to hydrolyze Z-Arg-Arg-NMec the enzyme resembled mammalian cathepsins L and S rather than cathepsin B (18Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 535-561Google Scholar, 19Kirschke H. Wiederanders B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 500-511Google Scholar). Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-NMec was adopted as the preferred low molecular weight substrate for the detection of acid-activatable spore proteinases. The activity of the spore enzymes toward this substrate was not totally dependent on a reducing agent (not shown), but since a reducing agent was required for the detection of cysteine proteinases at other stages of the D. discoideum life cycle and cysteine was found to be most appropriate, the latter was included routinely at a concentration of 20 mM. The activation of the 48-kDa proteinase required a weak acid with an incubation in 10% (v/v) (1.7 M) glacial acetic acid for 30–60 s being optimal. Neither 1.7 M HCl nor 10% (v/v) formic acid, which are both stronger acids than acetic acid, was effective, but 10% (v/v) propionic acid, also a weak acid, did activate the enzymes. Sodium acetate (1.7 M) had no effect. Activation could also be achieved using 0.1 M glycine buffer, pH 2.0, although a longer incubation step was required (2 min). The standard length of the acetic acid treatment was 30–60 s, but even a 15-s incubation period proved sufficient for activation. However, if the treatment was prolonged for more than 60 s less activity was observed, presumably because of subsequent denaturation of the activated enzyme. The activation of cysteine proteinases at low pH is not unique to enzymes of D. discoideum, although with one exception (20Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 94: 127-132Google Scholar) it has not been demonstrated in the manner described here. In most other cases activation has been shown to result from limited proteolysis of inactive pro-enzymes, and an intramolecular autocatalytic conversion has been implicated in studies of recombinant enzymes (13Mach L. Mort J.S. Glössl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13030-13035Google Scholar, 21Vernet T. Khouri H.E. Laflamme P. Tessier D.C. Musil R. Gour-Salin B.J. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21451-21457Google Scholar). It has been shown that mercuric ions, which inhibit cysteine proteinase activity, block both the activation of a latent cathepsin L (12McDonald J.K. Kadkyhodayan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 827-835Google Scholar) and the processing of the recombinant papain precursor (21Vernet T. Khouri H.E. Laflamme P. Tessier D.C. Musil R. Gour-Salin B.J. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21451-21457Google Scholar). To test whether an autocatalytic mechanism might be involved in the activation process described here, gels were incubated with HgCl2 immediately before treatment with acetic acid. HgCl2 was confirmed to be an inhibitor of the activated 48-kDa spore enzyme, an effect reversed by the inclusion of 20 mM cysteine in the gel incubation buffer (not shown). If gels were treated with HgCl2 before transfer to acid, activation still occurred (Fig. 3); samples pretreated with HgCl2 (for example, lanes 3 and 7) showed the same degree of activation as the equivalent untreated samples (lanes 4 and 8). Identical results were obtained whether or not electrophoresis was carried out in the presence of a reducing agent, which might have affected the ability of HgCl2 to inhibit the enzyme. Thus, in spite of the presence of an inhibitor of the enzyme at the time of acid treatment, the enzyme was still activated. This strongly suggested that an autocatalytic processing step was not involved. Attempts to activate proteinases prior to electrophoresis by either preparing or washing the samples with a low pH buffer have not proven successful. Incubation in 0.1 M glycine HCl buffer, pH 2.0, alone failed to activate the major spore proteinase (data not shown). Because of a likely requirement for a detergent in the activation process, SDS was added to the buffer, but no activity at all was detected after this treatment. It is possible that under these conditions other proteolytic enzymes inactivated the cysteine proteinases. To investigate further the possible mechanism of activation, the electrophoretic mobility of the activated proteinase was examined. Since activation has only been achieved with proteinases in gels, two-dimensional electrophoresis was used. Various procedures were tested to minimize a loss of activity of the acid-treated enzyme during the second run, which posed a major problem. However, whenever activity was detectable after the second run, regardless of the procedure used (see “Methods”), the mobility of the major acid-activatable proteinase was not apparently affected by the acid treatment. For example, Fig. 4 shows the result of using large blocks of the first gel for the second run and Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-NMec as the substrate. After the first electrophoresis run one gel block was acid treated, the other not, but the mobility of the proteinase during the second run was the same in both. The lack of effect of acid treatment was confirmed by the location of the activity band on the diagonal line of Coomassie Blue-stained proteins. Any protein whose mobility had changed between the two runs would lie above or below this line. Vegetative myxamoebae have much higher cysteine proteinase activity than spores (1North M.J. Cotter D.A. Dev. Genet. 1991; 12: 154-162Google Scholar, 3North M.J. Scott K.I. Lockwood B.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 261-268Google Scholar, 5North M.J. Cotter D.A. Franek K.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 835-840Google Scholar). Acid treatment did have some effect on the myxamoebal proteinase pattern, although only certain proteinases were affected. With Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-NMec as substrate two proteinases, ddCP48 in bacterially grown cells and ddCP51 in axenic cells were detectable only after acid treatment. The other proteinases did not require acid treatment (Fig. 5A). With gelatin-SDS-PAGE, however, it was not always possible to distinguish any effect of acid treatment (Fig. 5B). The difference between the effects observed with fluorogenic substrates and gelatin is likely to be due to the time required for detecting activity (less than 1 h and 16 h, respectively) and may reflect the fact that the vegetative proteinases, unlike the spore proteinase, are activated slowly during incubation at pH 4, the pH of the buffer used to detect bands in gelatin gels. As development proceeds, so cysteine proteinase activity declines. This has been shown using a number of different detection methods, including the standard gelatin-SDS-PAGE technique (1North M.J. Cotter D.A. Dev. Genet. 1991; 12: 154-162Google Scholar, 3North M.J. Scott K.I. Lockwood B.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 261-268Google Scholar). During the aggregation stage acid treatment enhanced the activity of some of the proteinases, but no new proteinases were detected. Following aggregation, acid treatment revealed the presence of a number of activatable enzymes. These were not always readily detectable using gelatin-SDS-PAGE but could be seen clearly with Boc-Val-Leu-Lys-NMec as substrate (Fig. 6). A proteinase with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa was detected only after acid treatment, whereas the activity of another, with an apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa, was enhanced significantly by acid treatment. The level of these two enzymes, together with ddCP18, increased after aggregation (from 12 h onward). All were confirmed as cysteine proteinases by their sensitivity to E-64. Some of the proteinases detected at this stage were probably associated with the extracellular matrix and slime sheath. For example, the 24-kDa enzyme appears to be one of those present in the spore matrix (see Fig. 1). However, preliminary results indicate that this is not true of the 60-kDa enzyme, which was was not removed from slugs by washing and appeared to be intracellular. During the final stages of sporulation in the life cycle of eukaryotic microorganisms, it seems reasonable to assume that the activity of lysosomal enzymes such as proteinases should become minimal, consistent with the dormant state of the organisms. In addition to the normal reductions of transcriptional and translational events during sporulation (22Loomis W.F. The Development of Dictyostelium discoideum. Academic Press, New York1982: 1Google Scholar), there are several other strategies that an organism might utilize to minimize lysosomal enzyme activity, including the secretion of enzymes, the synthesis of inhibitors, or alterations in the conformational state of the enzymes. Conversely, during the germination of dormant structures, increases in the activity of the lysosomal enzymes could result from de novo synthesis, the loss of inhibitors from preexisting enzymes, or conformational changes in preexisting enzymes. The results described here show that to detect some of the Dictyostelium cysteine proteinases using substrate-SDS-PAGE it was necessary to include a brief acid treatment step. The changes in cysteine proteinases during the different stages of the life cycle detected previously by gelatin-SDS-PAGE, i.e. without acid treatment, were consistent with the changes in net activity detected in cell extracts using cysteine proteinase-specific substrates such as peptide nitroanilides (5North M.J. Cotter D.A. Franek K.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 835-840Google Scholar, 23North M.J. Cotter D.A. Exp. Mycol. 1984; 8: 47-54Google Scholar). Thus it seems likely that the activatable enzymes were initially in an inactive form in the samples analyzed. We conclude that the lack of activity of these enzymes was not an artifact resulting simply from the procedures involved in the electrophoretic analysis and is therefore of physiological significance. The cysteine proteinases in D. discoideum may thus be synthesized and packaged in lysosomes as relatively inactive forms. It is not sufficient to free the enzymes from the spore lysosomes and incubate them at their optimal pH with protein or peptide derivatives to demonstrate enzymatic activity. Mammalian lysosomal cysteine proteinases are synthesized as pro-enzymes containing an amino-terminal pro-region consisting of 62 amino acids, in the case of cathepsin B, or approximately 100 amino acids in the case of other cysteine proteinases such as cathepsins H, L, and S. The enzymes are activated by removal of the pro-region shortly after leaving the Golgi apparatus and entering the lysosome. Although there is some evidence suggesting the involvement of other proteolytic enzymes, for example metalloproteinases and aspartic proteinases (24Hara K. Kominami E. Katunuma N. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 225-228Google Scholar, 25Nishimura Y. Kawabata T. Kato K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 261: 64-71Google Scholar), it is more likely that an autocatalytic process is involved (see 13Mach L. Mort J.S. Glössl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13030-13035Google Scholar). Typically, a 35–40-kDa inactive pro-enzyme is converted to a 22–33-kDa active enzyme that may then be further proteolytically processed. The cysteine proteinases of D. discoideum for which sequence information is available (6Pears C.J. Mahbubani H. Williams J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8853-8866Google Scholar, 7Williams J.G.

Mehta D.P. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28938-28945Google Scholar) are, like the aforementioned cathepsins, members of the papain superfamily (peptidase family C1 (27Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 461-486Google Scholar)), and it seems likely that all of them are synthesized as precursors containing a typical pro-region. A possible explanation for activation, therefore, might have been the acid-induced removal of the pro-peptide, as has been observed with cysteine proteinases from mammalian cells (9Maciewicz R.A. Wardale R.J. Etherington D.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 16: 1056-1057Google Scholar, 10Mason R.W. Gal S. Gottesman M.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 449-454Google Scholar, 11Mason R.W. Wilcox D. Wikstrom P. Shaw E.N. Biochem. J. 1989; 257: 125-129Google Scholar, 12McDonald J.K. Kadkyhodayan S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 827-835Google Scholar), tick eggs (28Fagotto F. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1990; 14: 237-252Google Scholar), and Leishmania mexicana mexicana (20Robertson C.D. Coombs G.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 94: 127-132Google Scholar). However, this would have resulted in a detectable shift in electrophoretic mobility, and this was not apparent for the 48-kDa spore enzyme or any of the other bands detectable on gels (Fig. 4). A second possibility was that the pro-enzyme was activated without the removal of the pro-region; the apparent molecular mass of the activated 48-kDa enzyme was sufficiently large to have included the pro-region. However, sequence data for two of the active enzymes produced by vegetative cells of D. discoideum suggest that this is unlikely. ddCP38 from bacterially grown cells and ddCP42 from axenic cells (respective molecular masses of approximately 38 and 40 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE), are both larger than cysteine proteinases found in other organisms but have amino-terminal sequences that align closely with those of other mature cysteine proteinases. 3A. Champion, G. Harrison, M. Wilkins, M. J. North, A. Gooley, and K. L. Williams, unpublished data. Thus D. discoideum cysteine proteinases can be large, even without a pro-region at the amino terminus, and this is most likely due to inserts within the mature sequence and glycosylation (26Souza G.M. Hirai J. Mehta D.P. Freeze H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28938-28945Google Scholar). It is therefore probable that the activatable enzymes had lost the pro-peptide prior to being treated with acid. The resolution achieved with the two-dimensional gel systems may not have allowed the detection of any change in mobility resulting from a slight reduction in molecular weight, and so the possibility that a small peptide was removed cannot be entirely discounted. However, in view of the lack of effect on activation of the cysteine proteinase inhibitor HgCl2, it seems more likely that the activation was due to a conformational change or the removal of a small, tightly bound inhibitor. The only cysteine proteinase inhibitor reported in D. discoideum is too large (14 kDa) (29Korth M.J. Finn D.J. Gustafson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 181-184Google Scholar) to have had any involvement in acid activation as its removal from any proteinase would have affected electrophoretic mobility. There are precedents for proteinase activation involving conformational changes; indeed it has been suggested that a change in conformation occurs before bond cleavage which removes the pro-region of the cathepsin L precursor (9Maciewicz R.A. Wardale R.J. Etherington D.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 16: 1056-1057Google Scholar). Another group of proteinases, the matrix metalloproteinases, are synthesized in a latent form that is inactive because of the formation of an intramolecular complex between the single cysteine residue in its pro-peptide domain and the essential zinc atom in the catalytic domain. A variety of activators including conformational perturbants, reversible sulfhydryl group modifiers, and irreversible sulfhydryl group modifiers trigger the so-called “cysteine switch” (30Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Google Scholar). Activation is achieved through dissociation of the cysteine from the complex. It is possible that the activation described here might be achieved through a similar mechanism but in this case involving the dissociation of an ionic bond. This in vitro activation technique worked not only for spore cysteine proteinases but was able to enhance the activity from cells at other developmental stages, although to different degrees. Thus, it is possible that many of the cysteine proteinases in D. discoideum can exist in at least two activity states, active and inactive, which can be altered by an acid shock. The extent to which acid treatment is needed to detect activity in vitro may reflect, in part at least, the degree of exposure to low pH already experienced by individual proteinases within the cells. It has become clear that the mature lysosomal enzymes of D. discoideum become acidified with the aid of specific and discrete proton pump vacuoles (31Padh H. Lavasa M. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5514-5520Google Scholar, 32Nolte K.V. Padh H. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18318-18323Google Scholar, 33Padh H. Lavasa M. Steck T.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 865-874Google Scholar). Our hypothesis for the production of dormant spore cryptic cysteine proteinases involves the synthesis of cysteine proteinases and their packaging into lysosomal vesicles that do not make immediate contact with the proton pump vacuoles. Although this would prevent the activation of new cysteine proteinases, it might not be sufficient to deactivate the existing enzymes completely. It is possible that the synthesis of a lysosomotropic agent such as ammonia, which is produced in large quantities during development (34Gregg J.H. Hackney A.L. Krivanek J.O. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1954; 107: 226-235Google Scholar), or glutamine, which rises from 1.5 mM in amoebae to 72.8 mM in spores (35Klein G. Cotter D.A. Martin J. Satre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 135-142Google Scholar), shocks the cysteine proteinases into the inactive form by serving as a sink for any protons previously present in the lysosome (16Cotter D.A. Sands T.W. Virdy K.J. North M.J. Klein G. Satre M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 892-919Google Scholar). Indeed it has now been found that treatment of the acid-activated proteinases with ammonia deactivates the enzymes, which can subsequently be reactivated with a second acid treatment. 4D. Cavallo, T. W. Sands, and D. A. Cotter, unpublished data. We also suggest that the dormant spore lysosome should have a relatively high pH, unlike the low pH of the functioning lysosomes in vegetative cells. During the spore germination process the fusion of the organelle with a functioning proton pump vacuole would provide a sufficient drop in pH to convert the inactive forms of the cysteine proteinases into their active conformations. Further research is required to determine the validity of our hypothesis and to ascertain whether acid-activatable proteinases are inactive within the cell and indeed if their activation has physiological significance. Interestingly, it was the developmental proteinases, including the spore enzymes, which were much less active without the incorporation of the acid treatment step in the analysis. Additional and more complex scenarios for the process of reducing lysosomal enzyme activities in vivo may involve: 1) the appearance of a development-specific inhibitor; 2) a difference in proteinase location, which affects conformation or inhibitor attachment; or 3) the synthesis of a new set of developmental cysteine proteinases that bind more tightly to an inhibitor present throughout the life cycle or which require special conditions to gain an active conformation. Additional research is also required to determine whether the acid activation phenomenon occurs with other enzymes and developmental systems. Such work is essential to understanding the specific mechanism(s) involved and their importance in regulating development. Thus far, preliminary results from this work involving acid-activatable forms of the cysteine proteinases in D. discoideum suggest that at least some of the proteinases revealed by this treatment during development correspond to the developmentally regulated cprA and cprB gene products. It is not yet known whether the 48-kDa acid-activated spore proteinase is one such or if this is identical to the vegetative enzyme ddCP48. Purification of the activatable proteinases is now in progress to establish their relationship to the predicted products of these genes, to investigate the activation mechanism in more detail, and to determine the extent to which it relates to the control of proteolysis during the development and germination of the dormant structures in the cellular slime molds."

Activation of the proenzyme by either 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate or chymotrypsin yielded proteins that absolutely required Ca2+ for activity, regardless of the pH of the reaction mixture. The trypsin- and stromelysin-activated gelatinases, on the other hand, did not require Ca2+ for activity at pH 7.5, but the activity of the trypsin-activated enzyme became Ca2+ dependent as the pH increased. The pH study revealed that an amino acid residue with an apparent pKa of 8.8 was involved in this process. The NH2-terminal analyses showed that trypsin- and stromelysin-activated enzymes had the same NH2 termini (Phe88), but 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate- and chymotrypsin-activated enzymes had Met75 and Gln89 or Glu92 as the NH2-terminal amino acid, respectively. These data, in conjunction with the x-ray crystal structure of collagenase, suggest that a salt linkage involving Phe88 is responsible for the Ca2+-independent activity of trypsin- and stromelysin-activated gelatinase. Replacing Asp432 in progelatinase with either Glu, Asn, Gly, or Lys resulted in the proteins that, upon activation by trypsin, required Ca2+ for activity. These substitutions did not significantly affect Km for the synthetic substrate but decreased the kcat and increased the half-maximal Ca2+ concentration required for enzyme activity (KCa) by severalfold. The effects on kcat and KCa depended on both charge and size of the side chains of the substituted amino acids. The decrease in kcat correlated well with the increase in KCa of the mutants. The orders of decrease in kcat and increase in KCa were wild type ≥ D432E > D432N > D432G > D432K and wild type ≤ D432E < D432N < D432G < D432K, respectively. These data suggest that in trypsin- or stromelysin-activated enzyme, the NH2-terminal Phe88 forms a salt linkage with Asp432, rendering the enzyme Ca2+ independent. Ca2+ affects catalytic activity of the 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate- and chymotrypsin-activated enzymes by substituting for the salt linkage and interacting with Asp432.

The uncontrolled expression of MMP has been reported to be associated with many pathological processes such as angiogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, and tumor metastasis (5Liotta L.A. Rao C.N.

These proteinases are often divided into three subgroups based on their substrate specificities: collagenases, gelatinases, and stromelysins. Gelatinase B, which specifically degrades types IV, V, and XI collagens as well as denatured collagens (gelatins), is believed to play an important role in both physiological and pathological processes. Several researchers have recently shown that cells bearing the gelatinase B cDNA are able to metastasize in nude mice, whereas inhibition of the gelatinase activity prevents metastasis (11DeClerck Y.A.

Gelatinase B activity is controlled at several levels (2Birkedal-Hansen H. Moore W.G.I. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen B. DeCarlo A. Engler J.A. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol.

Progelatinase B isolated from various cell lines is activated by autoproteolytic processing of both NH2-terminal propeptide and COOH-terminal hemopexin domain. Activation can be initiated in vitro by either a reaction with an organomercurial compound, such as 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA), or by limited proteolysis by other proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and stromelysin (16Triebel S.

The autoprocessing of gelatinase B in the presence of APMA occurs with a stepwise truncation of the NH2-terminal propeptide to Met75, followed by a Ca2+-dependent loss of COOH-terminal domain (19Bu C.H. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18563-18569Google Scholar), apparently to Ala506, and generates a 70-kDa active species (16Triebel S. Blaser J. Reinke H. Knauper V. Tschesche H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 280-284Google Scholar). Activation of the enzyme by trypsin, however, generates Phe88 as the amino terminus (19Bu C.H. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18563-18569Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the presence of amino acid residues 75–87, corresponding to the Met75-Arg-Thr-Pro-Arg-Cys-Gly-Val-Pro-Asp-Leu-Gly-Arg sequence in the APMA-activated gelatinase (Ea), renders the activity of the enzyme dependent on Ca2+, whereas removal of this fragment by trypsin abolishes the Ca2+ dependence of the enzyme activity (19Bu C.H. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18563-18569Google Scholar). This finding suggests that Ca2+ affects the enzyme activity by interaction with this fragment. Ca2+ has also been found to be indispensable for activity of other members of the MMP family (20Seltzer J.L. Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 173: 355-361Google Scholar, 21Lowry C.L. McGeehan G. Levine H.I. Protein Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 12: 42-48Google Scholar, 22Okada Y. Nagase H. Harris Jr., E.D. J. Biol.

As early as 1975, Seltzer et al. (20Seltzer J.L. Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 173: 355-361Google Scholar) demonstrated that Ca2+ plays a dual role in collagenase catalysis. It acts as an activator (20Seltzer J.L. Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 173: 355-361Google Scholar) and a stabilizer (20Seltzer J.L. Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 173: 355-361Google Scholar, 21Lowry C.L.

Schiner S. Piper M. Tschesche H. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 227-233Google Scholar) have identified at least three Ca2+-binding sites. One of the Ca2+ sites is sandwiched between the surface S-shaped double loop Arg145 to Leu160 and the surface of the β-sheet. Because this loop structure is rather compact, it is assumed that this Ca2+ contributes to the stability of the collagenase structure. However, we have recently shown that Ca2+ is only required for the stability of the trypsin-activated gelatinase B (Et), whereas it is involved in both stability and activity of Ea (19Bu C.H. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18563-18569Google Scholar). These observations led us to propose that Ca2+ affects gelatinase B catalysis by binding to the NH2-terminal region of Ea, inducing a conformational change in the protein and rendering the enzyme active (19Bu C.H. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18563-18569Google Scholar; Fig. 1, A1 or A2). It has been suggested that in the catalytic domain of neutrophil collagenase, the presence of Phe79 at the NH2 terminus stabilizes the active-site conformation by forming a salt linkage with Asp232 at the COOH-terminal region (27Reinemer P. Grams F. Huber R. Kleine T. Schiner S. Piper M. Tschesche H. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 227-233Google Scholar). Because the NH2-terminal amino acid of Et is Phe88 (corresponding to Phe79 in collagenase), one can envision that a similar salt linkage between Phe88 and Asp432 (corresponding to Asp232 in collagenase) in gelatinase mimics the role of Ca2+ in stabilizing the active-site conformation (Fig. 1, T2). In the present report, we have extended our previous study (19Bu C.H. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18563-18569Google Scholar) and clearly demonstrated that a salt linkage between Phe88 and Asp432 exists in Et. The presence of the salt linkage is responsible for Ca2+-independent activity and not for stability of gelatinase. In addition, our study provides evidence to suggest that the side chain of Asp432 can also ligand to Ca2+ in the absence of the salt linkage, thereby generating a catalytically competent enzyme. APMA, dimethyl sulfoxide, gelatin attached to 4% beaded agarose, trypsin treated with N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, soybean trypsin inhibitor insolubilized on 4% beaded agarose, chymotrypsin treated with Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, diisopropyl phosphorofluoride, iminodiacetic acid chelating resin, and all buffers were from Sigma. Zinc chloride, ultradry, 99.99% was from Alfa (Ward Hill, MA). Calcium chloride hydrate, 99.99% was from Aldrich. Transin, the rat homologue of stromelysin, was a kind gift of Dr. Lynn Matrisian (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). All of the materials for site-directed mutagenesis have been described previously (28Pourmotabbed T. Aelion J. Tyrrell D. Hasty K. Bu C.H. Mainardi C.L. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 527-535Google Scholar). [14C]Gelatin was prepared from calf skin as described previously (29Nagai Y. Hori H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 263: 564-573Google Scholar). The fluorogenic peptide, (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl) acetyl (Mca)-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-[3-(2′, 4′-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diaminopropionyl] (Dpa)Ala-Arg-NH2, was purchased from Bachem Bioscience, Inc. (Philadelphia, PA). Buffers and [14C]gelatin were rendered metal free, as described previously (19Bu C.H. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18563-18569Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the gelatinase B cDNA (pETNG; 30Pourmotabbed T. Solomon T.L. Hasty K.A. Mainardi C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 97-107Google Scholar) was performed by polymerase chain reaction, as described previously for creating the Asp432 to Gly mutation (28Pourmotabbed T. Aelion J. Tyrrell D. Hasty K. Bu C.H. Mainardi C.L. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 527-535Google Scholar). To substitute Glu, Asn, or Lys for Asp432, a degenerate mutagenic oligonucleotide, 5′-TTCACTGAGGGGCCCCCCTTGCATAAGGACGTGAATGGCATC-3′ was designed to mutate the codon for Asp432 (GAC) to that for Glu (GAG), Asn (AAT), or Lys (AAG). The underlined sequence is the mutated codons. All mutant cDNA was sequenced to verify that the desired substitution was the only one generated by polymerase chain reaction. Plasmids encoding for wild-type (WT) and mutant enzymes were introduced into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)(pLys), the cells bearing the plasmids were induced by isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, and the recombinant proteins were purified as described (30Pourmotabbed T. Solomon T.L. Hasty K.A. Mainardi C.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1204: 97-107Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford dye binding techniques (a standard Bio-Rad assay), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. WT and each mutant enzyme (∼15 µg/ml) were activated in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 µM ZnCl2, and 5 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5 (activation buffer) either by APMA (1.0 mM) for 16 h, by trypsin (20 µg/ml) for 4 h, by chymotrypsin (20 µg/ml) for 4 h, or by stromelysin (1 unit/ml, 1 unit of stromelysin degrades 1 µM fluorogenic peptide, Mca-PLGL(Dpa)AR-NH2, per min at 37°C) for 4 h at 37°C. Trypsin was removed by passage through a soybean trypsin inhibitor column (2 ml). Chymotrypsin- or stromelysin-activated enzyme was separated from chymotrypsin or stromelysin on a gelatin-agarose affinity column (1 ml) at 4°C. The column was washed thoroughly with the activation buffer to remove the activators. The activated gelatinase was then eluted with the activation buffer containing 15% dimethyl sulfoxide. Ca2+ was removed from the activated enzymes, as described previously (19Bu C.H. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18563-18569Google Scholar). Gelatinolytic activity of activated WT and mutants was determined by incubating the enzymes (1–23 µg/ml) with 100 µg of [14C]gelatin (77,000 cpm/mg gelatin) in a reaction mixture containing 10 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 µM ZnCl2, and 0–1.0 mM CaCl2 in a final volume of 150 µl at 37°C for 5 min to 2 h, as described (31Hibbs M.S. Hasty K.A. Seyer J.M. Kang A.H. Mainardi C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2493-2500Google Scholar). Duplicates were performed for each assay. The effect of pH on gelatinolytic activity of the enzymes was determined using the following buffers for the indicated pH ranges: 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.35-7.80; 50 mM CHES, pH 8.25-9.24; and 50 mM CAPS, pH 9.77. The kinetic parameters of activated WT and mutant enzymes were obtained by assaying the enzymes (0.02 µM) at 37°C against 0.5-20 µM fluorogenic peptide, Mca-PLGL(Dpa)AR-NH2, as described previously (32Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Google Scholar). The initial rates of substrate hydrolysis were determined by measuring the time-dependent increase in fluorescence (λex, 328 nm; λem, 393 nm) in a reaction mixture containing 10 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.5 µM ZnCl2, and 1 mM CaCl2 in a final volume of 150 µl. The assay was performed using an Aminco·Bowman Luminescence Spectrometer (SLM Instruments, Inc., Urbana, IL). Stabilities of activated WT and mutants (2–5 µg/ml) were determined by preincubating each enzyme species at 37°C in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) or CAPS buffer (pH 9.8) containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.5 µM ZnCl2 in the absence or presence of 1 mM Ca2+ for various times (0–60 min). The samples were then adjusted with 0.5 M HEPES (pH 7.5) and 10 mM Ca2+ to a final concentration of 50 and 1 mM, respectively. The activities remaining were assayed using [14C]gelatin or fluorogenic peptide as described above. Gelatin zymography and NH2-terminal sequence analyses were described previously (19Bu C.H. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18563-18569Google Scholar). The apparent affinity for Ca2+ (KCa) and Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) of WT and each mutant enzyme were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots using the ENZYME KINETICS program, version 1.0 (Trinity Software, Campton, NH). We have shown previously that APMA-activated gelatinase B (Ea) absolutely depends on Ca2+ for activity, but the activity of trypsin-activated enzyme (Et) is Ca2+ independent (19Bu C.H. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18563-18569Google Scholar). Because gelatinase B can be activated by other proteases, such as chymotrypsin and stromelysin (17Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21712-21719Google Scholar), the effect of these activators on Ca2+-dependent activity of gelatinase was assessed. The activity of gelatinase B that had been activated by various activators (APMA, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and stromelysin) was determined by assaying the enzyme against [14C]gelatin in the absence or presence of 1 mM Ca2+. As shown in Table I, chymotrypsin-activated gelatinase B, similar to Ea, had negligible activity in the absence of Ca2+. They were able to catalyze the degradation of gelatin substrate only in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+. Trypsin- or stromelysin-activated gelatinase B, on the other hand, exhibited significant activity in the absence of Ca2+ (78 and 73% of maximal activity, respectively). Ca2+-independent activity of Et was not due to trypsin contamination, because the activity of the enzyme was inhibited by a zinc chelating agent, 1,10-phenanthroline (19Bu C.H. Pourmotabbed T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18563-18569Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that stromelysin requires Ca2+ for activity (21Lowry C.L. McGeehan G. Levine H.I. Protein Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 12: 42-48Google Scholar); thus, the possibility that Ca2+-independent activity of stromelysin-activated gelatinase B resulted from the contaminated stromelysin is unprecedented. Zymographic analyses of gelatinase B activated by each activator showed that the 57.5-kDa unglycosylated progelatinase B was converted to a 41.5-kDa species by APMA (Fig. 2A, lane 2) and to a 40-kDa species by trypsin, chymotrypsin, or stromelysin (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–5). This finding agrees with the result obtained using the gelatinase B (92-kDa gelatinase) from HT 1080 human fibrosarcoma cells (17Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21712-21719Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal sequence analyses of the activated species (Table I and Fig. 2B) indicated that gelatinase B activated by APMA, trypsin, chymotrypsin, or stromelysin had Met75, Phe88, Gln89, or Glu92, or Phe88 as its NH2 terminus, respectively. It is interesting to note that both the trypsin- and stromelysin-activated species that did not require Ca2+ for activity had the same NH2 terminus, Phe88, whereas APMA and chymotrypsin-activated enzymes that depended on Ca2+ for activity displayed different NH2 termini. These observations suggest that the loss of Ca2+ requirement for the enzyme activity is associated with the presence of Phe88 at the NH2 terminus of the activated enzyme.Table I.Ca2+ dependency of gelatinase B activated by various activators and NH2 termini of activated speciesActivatorGelatinolytic activity (units/mg protein)aOne unit of enzyme degrades 1 µg of gelatin in 1 min at 37°C.−Ca2+/+Ca2+ (%)NH2-terminal sequences−Ca2++Ca2+Chymotrypsin96.172236.334.375MRTb75MRT, Met75-Arg-Thr; 88FQT, Phe88-Gln-Thr; 89QTF, Gln89-Thr-Phe; 92EGD, Glu92-Gly-Asp; 88FQT, Phe88-Gln-Thr.Stromelysin1990.172726.8373.088FQTAPMA53.171972.172.789QTF or 92EGDTrypsin1885.662418.8378.088FQTa One unit of enzyme degrades 1 µg of gelatin in 1 min at 37°C.b 75MRT, Met75-Arg-Thr; 88FQT, Phe88-Gln-Thr; 89QTF, Gln89-Thr-Phe; 92EGD, Glu92-Gly-Asp; 88FQT, Phe88-Gln-Thr. Open table in a new tab X-ray crystal structure of the catalytic domain of collagenase (27Reinemer P. Grams F. Huber R. Kleine T. Schiner S. Piper M. Tschesche H. Bode W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 227-233Google Scholar) has shown that the ammonium group of the NH2-terminal Phe79 makes a salt linkage with the side chain carboxylate group of Asp232 to stabilize the active site. Although the x-ray structure of gelatinase B has not been determined, considering the homology between members of MMP, it is reasonable to assume that the enzyme has a tertiary structure similar to collagenase. As shown above, the presence of the NH2-terminal Phe88 (corresponding to Phe79 in collagenase) in gelatinase B correlates with the loss of Ca2+ dependence of the enzyme. Therefore, it is possible that the formation of a salt linkage between Phe88 and Asp432 (corresponding to Asp232 in collagenase) is responsible for the observed gelatinase activity in the absence of Ca2+. If a salt linkage that mimics the effect of Ca2+ on enzyme activity exists in Et, disruption of the salt linkage at high pH should render activity of the enzyme to be Ca2+ dependent. The effect of pH on gelatinolytic activity of Et in the presence or absence of Ca2+ was investigated. As pH increased, Ca2+ dependence of gelatinolytic activity shifted gradually from being Ca2+ independent to Ca2+ dependent (Fig. 3). When the pH of the reaction mixture shifted from 7.4 to 9.8, the gelatinolytic activity of the enzyme decreased by about 35% in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+. However, about 95% of the activity was lost in the absence of Ca2+. This suggests that deprotonation of a positively charged group, probably associated with a salt linkage, is responsible for the loss of enzyme activity at pH 9.8 in the absence of Ca2+. The data also support the idea that disruption of the salt linkage at high pH can be compensated for by Ca2+ binding to the enzyme. It is common knowledge that the role of Ca2+ in MMPs is to stabilize the tertiary structures of the enzymes (20Seltzer J.L. Welgus H.G. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 173: 355-361Google Scholar, 21Lowry C.L. McGeehan G. Levine H.I. Protein Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 12: 42-48Google Scholar, 22Okada Y. Nagase H. Harris Jr., E.D. J. Biol.

Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the putative salt linkage plays a role similar to Ca2+ and stabilizes the conformation of Et at physiological pH in the absence of Ca2+. This was assessed by determining the effect of pH on the stability of Ea and Et in the absence or presence of Ca2+. The enzymes were incubated for various times (0–60 min) at pH 7.5 or 9.8 at 37°C in the presence or absence of 1 mM Ca2+ prior to assaying under normal conditions (pH 7.5, 37°C, and 1 mM Ca2+). Both enzymes had a similar stability at 37°C in the presence or absence of Ca2+, regardless of the pH of the solution (Fig. 4). They were essentially stable over 1-h preincubation at 37°C in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+ at either pH 7.5 or pH 9.8, whereas they lost activity in the absence of Ca2+. The loss of activity at either pH followed first-order decay kinetics, and the half-life of both Ea and Et was ∼22 min. At pH 7.5, in which the salt linkage should still be intact in Et, the enzyme did not show higher stability than Ea in the absence of Ca2+. This suggests that the Ca2+-independent activity of Et does not result from the stabilization effect of the putative salt linkage, and lack of activity of Ea in the absence of Ca2+ cannot be attributed to the instability of the enzyme. These data also imply that Ca2+ can act as a reversible stimulator, as well as a stabilizer, of the enzyme. This idea was further supported by assaying Ea and Et at pH 7.5 or pH 9.8 with or without Ca2+ (1 mM) for only 5 min at 37°C. Under this condition, less than 15% of total activity of the enzymes was lost in the absence of Ca2+. Ea was absolutely dependent on Ca2+ for activity, regardless of the pH of the reaction mixture, indicating that the enzyme activity resulting from addition of Ca2+ was due to the effect of Ca2+ on activity per se rather than on stability (Fig. 5). Et, on the other hand, was not active at pH 9.8 in the absence of Ca2+. However, it regained about 60% of its activity upon the addition of 1 mM Ca2+. The increased activity was comparable to the activity of Ea stimulated by Ca2+ at pH 9.8. A decrease in pH from 9.8 to 7.5 apparently had a similar effect to that of Ca2+ on enzymatic activity of Et. When Et was assayed at pH 7.5 in the absence of Ca2+, the enzyme displayed about 90% activity. Adding 1 mM Ca2+ increased the activity to 100%. This might be the stabilization effect of Ca2+ during the assay period. These data suggest that Ca2+ not only stabilizes gelatinase B but also stimulates the enzyme activity by reversibly binding to a distinct “activation” site. Ca2+ apparently affects catalysis by inducing a conformational change similar, if not identical, to the one generated by salt linkage in Et.Fig. 5Effects of pH and Ca2+on catalytic activity of Eaand Et. The catalytic activity of Ea (9.7 µg/ml) and Et (7.7 µg/ml) were determined using [14C]gelatin substrate in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) or CAPS (pH 9.8) buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.5 µM Zn2+ in the presence or absence of 1 mM Ca2+ at 37°C for 5 min.

INTRODUCTIONThe anthracycline antibiotic nogalamycin (Fig. 1) is biologically important for its anti-tumor activities and its ability to inhibit DNA-directed RNA synthesis in vivo (1Li L.H. Kuentzel S.L. Murch L.L. Pschigoda L.M. Krueger W.C. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 4816-4822Google Scholar). X-ray studies have shown how it binds to double-stranded DNA by intercalation at TpG, CpG, and CpA steps (2Williams L.D. Egli M. Gao Q. Bash P. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Rich A. Frederick C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2225-2229Google Scholar, 3Gao Y.G. Liaw Y.C. Robinson H. Wang A.H.-J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10307-10316Google Scholar). The anthracycline ring is parallel to the base pairs with its long axis aligned perpendicular to the base pairs and with the hydrophobic nogalose and amino-glucose sugar moieties lying in the minor and major grooves, respectively. DNA footprinting studies have indicated preferential binding at d(CA)·d(TG) steps (4Fox K.R. Waring M.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 4349-4356Google Scholar). NMR studies using nuclear Overhauser effect data have confirmed that sequences containing more than one potential site can form two different intercalation complexes with roughly equal proportions (5VanHoute L.P.A. Garderen C.J. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1667-1674Google Scholar). The x-ray structures of the DNA complexes with nogalamycin and with daunomycin and adriamycin, other anthracycline antibiotics with anti-tumor activities and similar sequence preferences, have utilized modifications to the hexameric sequence d(CGTACG). The initial structure of this series used in the high resolution x-ray structure of a complex with daunomycin (6Wang A.H.-J. Ughetto G. Quigley G.J. Rich A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1152-1163Google Scholar, 7Frederick C.A. Williams L.D. Ughetto G. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Rich A. Wang A.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2538-2549Google Scholar). Intercalated at steps 1 and 5. This structure and the related structures with d(CGATCG) or d(TGATCA) utilized the same 2:1 drug:DNA stoichiometry, crystallizing as an isostructural series in space group P43212 with 0.5 complex in the asymmetric unit. Later structures with nogalamycin in other space groups with either 0.5 or 1 complex per asymmetric unit have utilized *CGTsA*CG (6Wang A.H.-J. Ughetto G. Quigley G.J. Rich A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1152-1163Google Scholar, 7Frederick C.A. Williams L.D. Ughetto G. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Rich A. Wang A.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2538-2549Google Scholar) and TGATCA (8Moore M.H. Hunter W.N. Estaintot B.L. Kennard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 693-705Google Scholar, 9Nunn C. VanMeervelt L. Zhang S. Moore M. Kennard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 167-177Google Scholar), where *C indicates C or 5-MeC and where the phosphate group of the central step was replaced by a (R)-p-phosphorothioate to improve the crystallization characteristics.The intercalation of nogalamycin into DNA presents a mechanistic problem, since the dumbbell shape of the intercalator with its bulky sugar residues presumably requires substantial deformation of the DNA to effect entry. These deformations may persist in the resultant complex structure where the highly hydrophobic nogalose sugar lying in the minor groove will displace water molecules from the DNA in order to utilize maximum Van der Waals interactions. In the structural studies where there are two drug molecules per hexamer at steps 1 and 5, the deformation required to effect the intercalation process may be reduced, because there is no longer a requirement to propagate deformation beyond the terminal steps of the DNA. Another consideration in all previous crystallographic work is that the orientation of the two drug molecules is 2-fold symmetric about the central step in the DNA with 4 base pairs separating the two intercalation steps.We were interested in determining the structure of a nogalamycin:DNA complex containing a single drug molecule. Early work by Viswamitra and Salisbury 1Viswamitra and S. Salisbury, personal communication. established that crystalline complexes could be obtained with nogalamycin and the synthetic hexamer d(CCCGGG). However there were severe problems with the reproducibility of crystallization and the poor diffraction and thermal characteristics of the crystals, which optimally are unstable above 10°C. However we were particularly interested in this sequence, which has the advantage of a single, centrally located, putative site and therefore the potential for observing a stepwise effect of intercalation on the DNA conformation.RESULTSOverall Molecular StructureThe refined structure is shown in Fig. 2 (stereo view) which gives a view of the unsolvated complex perpendicular to the long axis of the drug and the DNA helix axis. The residues are numbered from the 5′ end C1 to G6 in chain 1 and C7 to G12 in chain 2. The DNA is oriented with the C1:G12 base pair at the top and the C7:G6 base pair at the bottom; the nogalamycin is intercalated between the C3:G10 and G4:C9 base pairs with the long axis of the chromophore perpendicular to the mean direction of the 2 flanking base pairs and with the nogalose and amino-glucose residues pointing toward the G6:C7 base pair at the bottom. The hydrophobic nogalose sugar residue is situated in the minor groove on the right-hand side of Fig. 2; it is associated with the duplex mainly by van der Waals interactions. The hydrophilic amino-glucose lies in the heavily solvated major groove on the left-hand side of the Fig. 2, it has several strong hydrogen bonds strengthening its association with the duplex. The overall shape of the DNA in the complex is intermediate between the A- and B-conformation. The sugar groups of the cytosine residues have conformations belonging to the c3′-endo family. The sugar groups of the guanosine residues have conformations belonging to the c2′-endo family with the exception of G10, which is c3′-endo. Thus 5 of the base pairs are composed of a cytosine in the A-conformation and a guanosine in the B-conformation.Fig. 2View of the 1:1 complex perpendicular to the helix axis showing the nogalamycin conformation with the amino-glucose located in the major groove on the left-hand side and the nogalose situated in the minor groove on the right-hand side. The aglycone inserted at the central step is slightly bent. This view shows how the major groove is widened in the region where the amino-glucose interacts with the 2 base pairs below the intercalation step. Also visible in the minor groove is the carbomethoxy group at C7 which is hydrogen-bonded to the guanine one step above. The symmetry related duplexes, tightly stacked on top and bottom of the complex, are depicted in red.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Crystal PackingThe complex is oriented in the cell so that the helix axis of the duplex is parallel to the x and y axes (Fig. 3). There is a tight contact between the base planes of the C1:G12 base pair and those of a symmetry related G6*:C7* base pair (see Figs. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9A). This leads to the formation of two sets of stacked bases, extended along the x and y axes, and crossing each other at right angles. They associate in the packing (by solvent-mediated well defined hydrogen bonds) where the major grooves face and interact with each other. The interactions in this region involve the phosphate backbone (P2-P4) of one duplex and the major groove of the crossing complex and a small number of critical solvent molecules. The protruding amino-glucose groups of both complexes form an integral part of the association. On the opposite side of the duplex, where the hydrophobic nogalose is situated in the minor groove, the packing arrangement delimits an infinite channel parallel to the z axis and about 20 Å in length and 10 Å in width. This region of the structure is characterized by higher thermal parameters for both the nogalose (B = 28–31 Å2) and the duplex (B = 22–29 Å2) and is apparently void of well ordered solvent atoms.Fig. 3The crystal packing viewed down the x (or y) axis: the two series of helices crossing each other along the x and y directions delimit infinite channels with an approximate cross-section of 9 × 20 Å running along x (and y). This illustrates the tight interactions between crossing helices on one side of the major groove. On the opposite side, the nogalose sugar and the P10-P13 phosphate backbone point toward the channels, with essentially no restriction. This kind of packing has been observed recently in RNA crystals (35Baeyens K.J. DeBondt H.L. Holbrook S.R. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 56-62Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 9Stacking of adjacent base pairs (steps) viewed along the helical axis.

The minor groove is shallower and wider than the prototype B-DNA structure observed (18Drew H.R. Dieckerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 535-556Google Scholar) for AT-rich structures and is closer toward a B-DNA structures containing CG-rich stretches, where there is enough width to allow a double chain or zig-zag pattern of water molecules (19Kopka M.L. Fratini A.V. Drew H.R. Dieckerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 163: 129-146Google Scholar, 20Westhof E. Prangé T. Chevrier B. Moras D. Biochimie (Paris). 1985; 67: 811-817Google Scholar, 21Westhof E. Beveridge D.L. Franks F. Water Science Reviews. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK1990: 24Google Scholar). This characterization is appropriate in that the nogalose is in van der Waals contact with chain 1 (G4 to G6), but less so with chain 2 (Fig. 4). There is an apparently empty channel between the nogalose residue and the other bank of the minor groove. (residues C7, C8, and C9).In the Major GrooveThe amino-glucose residue resides in the major groove extending from the central C3-G4 site toward the 3′ end of chain 1. The amino-glucose spans the major groove edge of the G:C pair G4:C9 but with only one direct hydrogen bond between the amino-glucose and the duplex. This is between O2G and N7 of G4 (2.84 Å). On the other side of the edge, the interaction between O4G and N4 of C9 is mediated by a bridging water molecule W2 (O4G-(2.79 Å)-W2-(2.89 Å)-C9N4). In this respect the interactions between the amino-glucose and the duplex are close to previous structures. There is an interaction between the amino-glucose and the duplex 2 base pairs after the intercalation site. This involves the dimethylamino group and the amino group C8N4 of the G5:C8 base pair and a bridging solvent molecule W28. This hydrogen bonding interaction is strong as indicated by the hydrogen bonding distances: (N3G-(2.60 Å)-W28-(2.81 Å)-C8N4).The orientation of the dimethylamino group is probably influenced to some extent by solvation effects where the amino-glucose partakes in the intricate network of hydrogen bonds corresponding to the “crossover” contact. There is a direct hydrogen bond (3.08 Å) between O4G of the aglycone and a phosphate oxygen (C2*O1P). The solvent molecules W2 and W28 are also hydrogen-bonded to C2*O2P (2.87 and 2.79 Å, respectively). The dimethylamino group is probably influenced by W28, which participates in the strong intermolecular interaction (N3G-(2.60 Å)-W28-(2.79 Å)-C2*O2P). The solvent molecule W28 is tetrahedrally co-ordinated with a very low thermal parameter (B = 13 Å2), see Fig. 8. However, there are some differences in the sugar conformations when compared to nogalamycin in the 2:1 complexes (Fig. 5). The free and bound state comparisons (least squares fit) of the nogalamycin alone clearly show that either the bending and conformations of the sugars or dimethyl-amino group orientation are different.The aglycone is inserted at the C-G central step, with specificity determined by the flanking sugar interactions, one step behind and two steps ahead as indicated previously and by interactions between the O1 and O12 atoms and the bridging phosphate group between C3 and G4. The orientation is similar as to the other 2:1 complexes and induces equivalent unwinding (Table III). A new feature in this structure is a bridging water molecule W17 which connects the atoms O1 and O12 of the anthracycline aglycone to the phosphate group which spans the intercalation site on the C3-G4 step (O12-(2.97 Å)-W17 (3.09 Å)-G4O1P) (Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8).Table IIIHelical parametersHelical twist angle (C(1′)…C(1′) vectors)Vertical displacementÅC(1)———————————————————G(12)36.9°3.4ÅC(2)———————————————————G(11)30.7°4.4ÅC(3)———————————————————G(10)(Nogala…20.0°5.9Å…mycine)G(4)———————————————————C(9)31.9°3.9ÅG(5)———————————————————C(8)37.0°3.5ÅG(6)———————————————————C(7)“Propeller twist”“Buckle”C(1)-−17°———-+2°G(12)C(2)-−9°———-+7°G(11)C(3)-−3°———-−14°G(10)Nogala……mycineG(4)-+3°———-+11°C(9)G(5)-−5°———-+1°C(8)G(6)-−13°———-−3°C(7) Open table in a new tab The Axial Carbomethoxy GroupThis group is situated within the minor groove of the duplex interacting one step before the C-G insertion site. There is a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen O14 of the aglycone and G10N2 (3.15 Å). There are two additional polar contacts through water molecules toward the furanose oxygen atoms of residues C1 and C2. The geometry of these interactions suggests that alteration to this carbomethoxy group (i.e. to a free carboxylate) could affect both the solubility and the binding affinity of the drug by strengthening the hydrogen bonding in this region.Distribution of SolventThe hydration on the major groove side of the duplex is ordered with readily visible water molecules and an abundance of significant electron density. This contains the more polar of the two sugar residues, the amino glucose. On the minor groove side there are very few ordered water molecules. The way in which the nogalose sits in the minor groove leaves a space which should be filled with solvent/MPD (Fig. 3); however, the electron density is too low to say what the fill is. One groove is more hydrated than the other, and low B values are observed.About 47 water molecules were localized with temperature B factors ranging from 12 to 60 Å2. They form in the major groove a complicated hydrogen bonded network with many tetra-co-ordinated molecules. The most important, already described above, are W28 which connect the O4G of the amino-glucose to O2P of C2*, the N4 of C8, and W20 (2.9 Å, this water molecule is one having the lowest B temperature factors, B = 12 Å2). W20 also connects O2P of C3 (2.65 Å, symmetry-related) and two other water molecules: W15 (2.80 Å) and W30 (2.79 Å). Finally, W30 is connected to W9 (3.03 Å), N4 of C7 (2.81 Å), and W34 (2.99 Å). The water molecules in this region represent a remarkable arrangement of five tetra-co-ordinated water molecules, that builds a strong zig-zag spine, not analogous to the one observed in the minor groove of the B form of DNA (19Kopka M.L. Fratini A.V. Drew H.R. Dieckerson R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 163: 129-146Google Scholar, 21Westhof E. Beveridge D.L. Franks F. Water Science Reviews. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK1990: 24Google Scholar), but equivalent in characteristics.In the same region a hydration pentagon is observed in the major groove, probably related (22Kennard O. Cruse W. Nachman J. Prangé T. Shakked Z. Rabinovitch D. J. Biomol. Struct. & Dyn. 1986; 3: 623-647Google Scholar) to the A-like conformations of the cytosines, connecting the O1P atom of C2 and the nogalamycin O5G atom (Fig. 7). These water molecules have low B values, in the range 13–20 Å2.Some phosphate groups are bridged by water molecules like W11 or W10. These molecules are located on the first strand C1-G6. The second strand is less hydrated. The minor groove contains six water molecules (with <B> ≥ 45 Å2), while more than 25 water molecules are present in the major groove (Fig. 8).Helical PropertiesThe helical parameters of the duplex and the torsion angles of the sugar-phosphate backbone were calculated with the program NEWHEL (23Dickerson R.E. NEWHEL. 93. UCLA University, 1993Google Scholar) and are given in Table III, Table IV. In order to make enough room for the nogalamycin to enter between the central C3:G10 and G4:C9 base pairs (step 3), the helix has been unwound, allowing a gap. This separation is accompanied by some changes in the torsion angles along the sugar-phosphate backbone, including changeover in sugar conformation from c3′-endo to c2′-endo at the intercalation site for chain 1 and one step further along from the intercalation site the 3′ end of chain 2.Table IVThe backbone torsion anglesResidueαβγδεζχC15786−161−67−157C2−711625576−147−83−157C3−671616190−162−73−142G4−6820266146−149−148−103G5−6015851140−181−105−118G6−8620561144−103C76791−151−62−164C8−771745986−150−80−148C9−721705791−165−86−133G10−601746285−186−75−143G11−6218158153−175−145−110G1257156−51165−105Mean values for A and B DNA (36Dickerson R.E.

At the central step the helical twist angle is reduced from 36° (for B-DNA) to 20.0° corresponding to an unwinding of 16.0°. The rise parameter h, corresponding to the vertical displacement of the C1′-C1′ vectors parallel to the helix axis, is 5.9 Å compared with a value of 3.4 Å for B-DNA. The cavity in which the nogalamycin aglycone sits is not flattened across top and bottom but is buckled upwards from the centre by −14° for the C3:G10 base pair and downwards by +11° for the G4:C9 base pair. The propellor twist angles for the C3:G10 and G4:C9 base pairs are reduced to values of −3° and +3°, respectively. The diamond-shaped cavity is similar to that observed in previous structures containing nogalamycin, where the changes associated with buckling and reduced propellor twist were explained in terms of optimization of the van der Waals contacts with the surface of the aglycone.If we now consider the intermediate steps 2 and 4, the values for helical twist and rise are still smaller than standard values for B-DNA. The helical twist angles are 30.7 and 31.9° for steps 2 and 4, respectively, corresponding to small unwinding values of 5.3 and 4.1°. The sugar-phosphate backbone is still somewhat stretched with rise values of 4.4 and 3.9 Å.The terminal steps 1 and 5 have values of 37.0 and 36.9° for helical twist and 3.4 and 3.5 Å for rise, which are more characteristic of B-DNA, and Table III shows how the propellor twist and buckle angles change from special values at the intercalation site to more standard for the terminal base pairs. The only base pair away from the cavity that shows an appreciable buckling angle is the intermediate base pair C2:G11, which has a value of +7.0°. This corresponds to a change of +21° from the C3:G10 base pair. It is probably correlated with the observation that the sugar-pucker changes from c3′-endo for G10 to c2′-endo for G11.The manner in which the individual base pairs stack on top of each other can be seen in Fig. 9. There is an overall similarity to the stacking observed in d(G4C4) (24McCall M. Brown T. Kennard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 385-396Google Scholar) and other C- and G-rich structures (25Shakked Z. Guerstein-Guzikevich G. Eisenstein M. Frolow F. Rabinovich D. Nature. 1989; 342: 456-460Google Scholar) that crystallize in the A-conformation. There is partial overlap between guanine residues of successive base pairs but the overlap between cytosine bases is poor. The large values of −17.0° and −13.7° for the propellor twist angles of base pairs C1:G12 and G6:C7 are probably indicative of structural adjustments associated with optimal stacking of adjacent complexes along the x and y axes.The adjustments along the sugar-phosphate backbone are both complex and regular with individual backbone torsion angles falling near to the average values for A-DNA or B-DNA depending on the sugar conformation of the particular residue. The sugar conformations belong to the c3′-endo family for each cytosine residue and to the c2′-endo family for each guanosine residue except for G10 which is c2′-endo. In terms of pseudo-rotation parameters (26Altona C. Sundaralingam M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 8205-8212Google Scholar, 27Westhof E. Sundaralingam M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 1493-1500Google Scholar), depicted in Fig. 10, the cytosine residues and G10 are clustered in the region 3E (Northern) and the remaining guanosine residues are spread over region 3E to 2E, situated on the other side (Southern) in the diagram. For chain 1 the conformation is A-like for the first three nucleotides changing at the intercalation step to a B-like conformation for the last three residues. For chain 2 the conformation is A-like for the first four residues, changing to B-like for the last two residues. The transition from A to B shows up in the Pi− Pi+1 distances along each chain. One interesting feature of these values is that for the intercalation step, the distances, 6.36 Å from P3 to P4 in chain 1 and 6.14 Å from P9 to P10 in chain 2, are intermediate between the standard values of 5.9 Å for A-DNA and 7.0 Å for B-DNA (Table V).Fig. 10Pseudo-rotation diagram of the sugar residues (P, τm).

Open table in a new tab The backbone torsion angles in Table IV are in general close to values associated with A-DNA and B-DNA. The only unusual changes from normal A-DNA and B-DNA values are β = 202°, ζ = 212°, and (ε−ζ) = −1° for residue G4. Changing β from a “normal” value around 162–202° for residue G4 allows the bases C3 and G4 to open. On the other chain, where the sugar conformations of residues C9 and G10 are c3′-endo, the value β = 174° for G10 is normal, but a small change to higher values would have a substantial effect on the opening of bases C9 and G10. The other unusual value for ζ and ε−ζ for residue G4 is associated with a swinging of the phosphate group of P4 toward the major groove. In this structure, the phosphate oxygen atom O1P4 is now able to form a hydrogen-bonded interaction via the bridging water molecule W17 to O12 and O1 of the aglycone.DISCUSSIONIntercalation is one of the most important way the drugs interact with DNA. This normally leads to perturbation of the double helix, altering the cell metabolism and very often leading to the end of the cell growth (28Heidelberger C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 79-121Google Scholar). A large number of such chemicals are known, some are synthetic (9-aminoacridine, acridine orange, ethidium bromide) some are naturally produced by plants (ellipticine) or fungi or bacteria (daunomycin, actinomycin, nogalamycin …). They all have strong biochemical activities and are evaluated in medicine as antibiotics, antimitotics, carcinogenics … The mechanism of drug intercalation has been extensively investigated (29Saenger W. Cantor C.R. Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure. Springer -Verlag Inc., New York1983: 350Google Scholar). Thermodynamic and kinetic studies by spectroscopic techniques are in favor of a two-step mechanism (30Wakelin L.P. Waring M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 144: 183-214Google Scholar, 31Islam S.D. Neidle S. Gandecha B.M. Partridge M. Patterson L.H. Brown J.R. J. Med. Chem. 1985; 28: 857-864Google Scholar), while a close description of the intercalation geometry has been determined by x-ray diffraction on a number of short dinucleotide complexes as well as some longer sequences (hexamers). But up to now, all the crystallized complexes have the drug inserted in the first/last step of the DNA which limits the description because of termination effects.Why Did We Use This Hexameric Sequence?The original purpose of this work was to get a more detailed description for the intercalation process for a single site and in particular determine the extent to which the helical parame"

(1990) Agric. Biol. Chem. 54, 1771-1779). The prosequence of RNAP-I has the function to promote correct folding of its mature part. Deletion (Δpro) and amino acid substitutions (M1) in the prosequence block secretion of RNAP-I (Fukuda, R., Horiuchi, H., Ohta, A., and Takagi, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 9556-9561).In this study, little accumulation of Δpro was observed in Western blot analysis of the cell extracts of the transformants producing Δpro using anti-RNAP-I antisera. In contrast, M1 was accumulated in the yeast cells. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that they were synthesized at almost the same rates and that Δpro was degraded in the cells more rapidly than M1. In subcellular fractionation analysis, Δpro was found in the fraction that contained most of the activity of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker enzyme, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. In indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, Δpro was observed in the ER. Similar result was also observed in a mutant which is deficient of the two vacuolar proteases, proteinase A and proteinase B. So, the vacuolar proteases are not involved in degradation of Δpro. From these results, we concluded that RNAP-Is with the mutated prosequences, which probably could not be folded correctly, were retained and degraded in the ER. Rhizopus niveus aspartic proteinase-I (RNAP-I) is secreted by Saccharomyces cerevisiae extracellularly (Horiuchi, H., Ashikari, T., Amachi, T., Yoshizumi, H., Takagi, M., and Yano, K. (1990) Agric.

In eukaryotic cells, most of nascent secretory proteins are targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumHSPhigh speed pelletHSShigh speed supernatantLSPlow speed pelletPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPDIprotein disulfide isomeraseRNAP-IR. niveus aspartic proteinase-Ikbkilobase(s). after their signal sequences are recognized. Then these proteins are translocated across the ER membrane co- or post-translationally. Many secretory proteins have their final conformations in the ER lumen, then are transported to the Golgi compartment and secreted from cells. Some proteins that cannot be folded correctly or assembled into proper multimers are retained in the ER. Molecular chaperones such as immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, BiP, bind to those immature or abnormal proteins and keep them retained in the ER to stimulate their proper folding or multimerization (for review, see 3Gething M.-J.

Recently, it has been revealed that protein degradation machinery is present in the ER and some secretory or membrane proteins that could not be folded or multimerized correctly are degraded in the ER (for review, see 7Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 560-592Google Scholar). But little is known about the mechanisms of recognition and degradation of malfolded proteins by these protein degradation machinery in the ER. Three kinds of mutated proteins are shown to be degraded in the ER of Saccharomyces cerevisiae; these are a secretion-defective mutant of human α-1-protease inhibitor (8McCracken A.A. Kruse K.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 729-736Google Scholar), mutants of carboxypeptidase Y, carrying an Arg instead of a Gly in a highly conserved region, and proteinase A, in which 37 amino acids spanning the processing site of the prosequence are deleted (9Finger A. Knop M. Wolf D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 565-574Google Scholar). In addition, it is considered that the unassembled 100-kDa integral membrane subunit of the yeast vacuolar H+-ATPase complex is degraded in the ER of the cell lacking Vma21p, which is suggested to be required for assembly of the integral membrane sector of V-ATPase in the ER (10Hill K.J. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1039-1050Google Scholar). Rhizopus niveus, a filamentous fungus, secretes large amounts of aspartic proteinases extracellularly. We have cloned and sequenced genes encoding aspartic proteinase-I (11Horiuchi H. Yanai K. Okazaki T. Takagi M. Yano K. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 272-278Google Scholar) and aspartic proteinases II-V (RNAP-I to RNAP-V) (12Sakaguchi K. Takagi M. Horiuchi H. Gomi K. Kinghorn J.R. Turner G. Applied Molecular Genetics of Filamentous Fungi. Blackie Academic and Professional, London1992: 54Google Scholar). RNAP-I is synthesized as a precursor form with a pre-sequence (21 amino acid residues) and a prosequence (45 amino acid residues) at the N terminus of the mature part (323 amino acid residues). RNAP-I is also secreted extracellularly by S. cerevisiae efficiently when the encoding gene is introduced and expressed (1Horiuchi H. Ashikari T. Amachi T. Yoshizumi H. Takagi M. Yano K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 1771-1779Google Scholar). The prosequence of RNAP-I is essential for both renaturation of the denatured mature part in vitro and secretion of the mature part in vivo in S. cerevisiae. Some RNAP-Is with the mutated prosequences are not secreted extracellularly at all (2Fukuda R. Horiuchi H. Ohta A. Takagi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9556-9561Google Scholar). Therefore, the prosequence of RNAP-I is suggested to be essential for correct folding of its mature part in vivo. In this paper, we examined the transport, accumulation, and degradation of those RNAP-Is with the mutated prosequences in S. cerevisiae. We found that these precursor RNAP-Is were retained and degraded in the ER. Therefore, it is concluded that the precursors that cannot be folded correctly in the ER lumen are specifically recognized and degraded by the degradation machinery in the ER lumen. E. coli JA221 (recA1 leuB6 trpE6 hsdR−hsdM+lacY) was used as a host for plasmid construction and strain CJ236 (dut1 ung1 thi-1 relA1;pCJ105 (F′camr)) as a host for site-directed mutagenesis. S. cerevisiae strain R27-7C-1C (MATa his3 leu2 ura3 trp1) was used as a host for production of RNAP-I with the wild-type or the mutated prosequences. Strain #334 (MATα leu2 ura3 reg1 gal1 pep4 prb1) were used as hosts for production of Δpro. Yeast cells were cultivated aerobically at 30°C. For selection of yeast transformants, YNBD medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose) was used with appropriate supplements. Nucleic acid modification enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co. (Kyoto, Japan) and used under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. An oligonucleotide for site-directed mutagenesis was synthesized with a model 391 DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). Recombinant DNA manipulations were done by the standard methods (13Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.1Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was carried out using the lithium acetate procedure described by Ito et al. (14Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Google Scholar). Plasmid pYPR28412, which encodes an RNAP-I derivative Δpro* in which Asp100 of Δpro was replaced with Ala to inactivate the protease active site, was constructed as follows. A 0.4-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment from pYPR2841 (2Fukuda R. Horiuchi H. Ohta A. Takagi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9556-9561Google Scholar) was cloned between EcoRI and SalI sites of pUC119 (resulting in pUC2841), and Asp100 was replaced with Ala by site-directed mutagenesis with a 26-mer synthetic oligonucleotide, 5′-AAACTTGATTTTGCAACTGGTTCTTC-3′. A 0.4-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment from the resultant double-stranded DNA was ligated with a 9.4-kb EcoRI-SalI fragment of pYPR2841 to form the plasmid pYPR28412. Plasmid pYPR2841U, which was used to express Δpro in pep4 prb1 cells, was constructed as follows. A 2.2-kb HindIII fragment of pYPR2841, which contained glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene promoter, Δpro, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene terminator, was transferred into PvuII site of YEp24. Accurate construction of all plasmids was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. Nucleotide sequencing was performed on the Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencing system. Yeast cells were collected in a tube, washed with 10 mM sodium azide, and suspended in Laemmli sample buffer (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). One volume of glass beads was added to the tube, and then it was vortexed for 20 s and put on ice for 1 min. This step was repeated five times, and the preparation was boiled for 5 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C, the supernatant was used as a total cell extract. SDS-PAGE was done by the method of Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Detection of filter-bound antibodies was carried out according to the enhanced chemiluminescence method with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Corp.). Transformants of S. cerevisiae were cultured in YNBDCU medium (YNBD medium containing 2% casamino acids and 50 µg/ml uracil) for 12 h. Cells in a 1.1-ml culture were collected and inoculated in 1.1 ml of YNBDHLU medium (YNBD medium containing 20 µg/ml histidine, 30 µg/ml leucine, and 50 µg/ml uracil) supplemented with the amino acid mixture (20 µg/ml arginine, 30 µg/ml tyrosine, 30 µg/ml isoleucine, 30 µg/ml lysine, 50 µg/ml phenylalanine, 100 µg/ml glutamic acid, 100 µg/ml aspartic acid, 150 µg/ml valine, 200 µg/ml threonine, 400 µg/ml serine). After 20 min at 30°C, cells were labeled with 0.1 mCi of [35S]methionine for 5 min and an aliquot (200 µl) was transferred to a chilled tube containing 2 µl of 100 mM azide. Then the remaining cells were collected, washed, and incubated in 900 µl of YNBDHLU medium supplemented with the amino acid mixture and 2 mg/ml methionine. An aliquot was removed into ice-cold azide at intervals. Immunoprecipitation was performed by the method described by Franzusoff et al. (16Franzusoff A. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 662-674Google Scholar) with some modifications. Total cell extract (40 µl) was prepared as described by Yaffe and Schatz (17Yaffe M.P. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4819-4823Google Scholar). Four volumes (160 µl) of IP dilution buffer (1.25% Triton X-100, 190 mM NaCl, 6 mM EDTA, 60 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) were added to the cell extract in a tube. After the addition of 4 µl of 1:10 diluted preimmune sera, the extract was incubated on ice for 1 h. Then 40 µl of 10% IgG Sorb (The Enzyme Center, Inc., Malden, MA) were added, and the extract was incubated for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was taken into a tube and 1:10 diluted anti-RNAP-I antisera was added, after which it was incubated for 1 h on ice. Then 40 µl of 10% IgG Sorb were added, and the extract was incubated for 30 min on ice. After centrifugation, the pellet in the tube was washed four times with IP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)). After 40 µl of Laemmli sample buffer was added, it was boiled for 5 min and the mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE. Subcellular fractionation analysis was performed by the method of Nakano et al. (18Nakano A. Brada D. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 851-863Google Scholar) with some modifications. S. cerevisiae spheroplasts were prepared by the method of Franzusoff et al. (16Franzusoff A. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 662-674Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were disrupted with Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (15 strokes). The extracts were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to prepare the pellet (low speed pellet, LSP) and the supernatant (low speed supernatant). The low speed supernatant fraction was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C to obtain the high speed pellet (HSP) and the supernatant (HSS). The amount of Δpro or M1 was examined by Western blot analysis with anti-RNAP-I antisera. The amounts of the marker enzymes of the ER (NADPH-cytochrome c reductase), Golgi (heat-stable dipeptidylaminopeptidase) vacuole (carboxypeptidase Y), and cytosol (α-glucosidase) were determined as described by Kubota et al. (19Kubota S. Yoshida Y. Kumaoka H. Furumichi A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 81: 197-205Google Scholar), Bordrallo et al. (20Bordrallo C. Schwencke J. Rendueles M.S. FEBS Lett. 1984; 173: 199-203Google Scholar) (for both dipeptidylaminopeptidase and carboxypeptidase Y), and Halvorson et al. (21Halvorson H. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 559-562Google Scholar), respectively. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed by the method described by Preuss et al. (22Preuss D. Mulholland J. Kaiser C.A. Orlean Albright C. Rose M.D. Robbins P.W. Botstein D. Yeast. 1991; 7: 891-911Google Scholar) with some modifications. Transformants were grown in YNBDCU medium for 12 h and fixed by adding formaldehyde to the final concentration of 4% and incubating for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-RNAP-I antisera, anti-protein disulfide isomerase antisera (a kind gift from Dr. Takemitsu Mizunaga), anti-β-galactosidase antibody, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antisera were diluted 1:1000, 1:500, 1:1000, and 1:200, respectively. Vacuolar components were visualized with lucifer yellow CH by the methods of Wada et al. (26Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18665-18670Google Scholar) with some modifications. Samples of 1 ml of exponentially growing cells in YNBD medium containing 2% Casamino acids were harvested, resuspended in YEPD containing 10 mg/ml of lucifer yellow CH, and incubated for 6 h with agitation. Labeled cells were diluted with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS and washed with the same buffer five times. The vacuoles were observed with a fluorescence microscope. The prosequence of RNAP-I is essential for extracellular secretion of the mature part in S. cerevisiae and RNAP-Is with the mutated prosequences, Δpro and M1, are not secreted at all (2Fukuda R. Horiuchi H. Ohta A. Takagi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9556-9561Google Scholar). In Δpro, the whole prosequence (from Ser22 to Ala66) are deleted, and in M1, Ala49-Leu50 is replaced by Asp-Pro (numbering is from the initiation codon Met). To examine whether these RNAP-Is with the mutated prosequences were synthesized in the cells, the transformants harboring the plasmids encoding these RNAP-Is with the mutated prosequences were cultured for 14 h at 30°C, and the total cell extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-RNAP-I antisera. Both of the mutated as well as the wild-type RNAP-I precursors were detected in the cell extracts, but not in equal amounts. Little accumulation of Δpro was observed in the extracts of the cells (Fig. 1, lane 3), and the amount of M1 accumulated in the cells was more than that of Δpro (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and 4). To test the possibility of autocatalytic degradation of Δpro in the cells, the intracellular accumulation of Δpro*, in which one of the active sites, Asp100, of Δpro was changed to Ala to inactivate this enzyme was examined. The amount of Δpro* in the cells was less than that of the wild-type precursors and was almost equal to that of Δpro (Fig. 1, lanes 2, 3, and 5). Therefore, it was suggested that lower level of accumulation of Δpro was not due to autocatalytic degradation in the cells. To investigate why Δpro was not accumulated so much as M1 in the cells, the pulse-chase analysis was done. Transformants producing Δpro or M1 were pulse-labeled for 5 min with [35S]methionine and chased for 0, 30, or 60 min. Δpro and M1 were synthesized at almost the same levels (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 4). However, after 30 min of chase, most of Δpro disappeared from the cell extract (Fig. 2, lane 2). The amount of M1 after 30 min of chase also decreased, but not so much as that of Δpro did (Fig. 2, lane 5). Δpro and M1 were not secreted extracellularly at all (2Fukuda R. Horiuchi H. Ohta A. Takagi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9556-9561Google Scholar). These results indicated that Δpro and M1 were degraded in the cells and that the lower level of accumulation of Δpro in the cells was due to the faster rate of the intracellular degradation. To determine the intracellular site of accumulation of Δpro and M1, subcellular fractionation analysis was performed. Spheroplasts of the transformants producing Δpro or M1 were homogenized, and the cell extracts were subjected to differential centrifugation at 1,000 × g and 100,000 × g. Three fractions, LSP, HSP, and HSS, were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-RNAP-I antisera. Both Δpro and M1 were recovered exclusively in the LSP fractions (Table I). Most of the activity of an ER marker enzyme, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, was also collected in the LSP fraction. The activity of a Golgi marker enzyme, heat-stable dipeptidylaminopeptidase, was recovered in both the LSP and the HSP fractions. The activity of a vacuolar enzyme, carboxypeptidase Y, was recovered in both the LSP and HSS fractions. Most of the activity of cytosolic enzyme, α-glucosidase, was collected in the HSS fraction. Therefore both Δpro and M1 were obtained in the fractions that included most of the ER marker enzyme activity.Table IDistribution of RNAP-Is with the mutated prosequences and marker enzymesProtein (localization)% TotalΔProM1LSPHSPHSSLSPHSPHSSΔPro or M1937090100NADPH-cytochrome c reductase (ER)701911602218Heat-stable DPAP (Golgi)5141854388Carboxypeptidase Y (vacuole)28567361648α-Glucosidase (cytosol)16480241363 Open table in a new tab To further define the localization of Δpro, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-RNAP-I antisera was carried out. The nuclei in these cells were simultaneously stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The transformants producing Δpro showed prominent staining of the region surrounding the nuclear DNA (Fig. 3A), while no staining was observed when non-related antibodies (anti-β-galactosidase antibodies) were applied to those cells (Fig. 3C). The transformants producing M1 showed the same staining pattern as those producing Δpro (data not shown). As a marker for the ER, the staining of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) was also performed with anti-PDI antisera. The staining pattern of PDI was similar to that of Δpro (Fig. 3B). In eukaryotic cells, vacuole (lysosome in mammalian cells) contains various proteases and many proteins are degraded in it (23Klionsky D.J. Herman P.K. Emr S.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 266-292Google Scholar, 24Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7963-7966Google Scholar). If Δpro is degraded in vacuole, Δpro would be accumulated in vacuole of the vacuolar protease-deficient cells. To address this possibility, the localization of Δpro was investigated in a mutant that is deficient of the major vacuolar proteases, proteinase A and proteinase B, by indirect immunofluorescence microscopical observation. In pep4 prb1 cells, prominent staining of the perinuclear region was observed as in the wild-type cells (Fig. 4A). The staining pattern of PDI was similar to that of Δpro (Fig. 4B). The staining pattern of Δpro was different from the pattern of vacuole visualized with lucifer yellow CH (Fig. 4D). Therefore, it was suggested that Δpro was degraded not in vacuole, but in the ER. In this paper, we analyzed the intracellular transport, accumulation, and degradation of RNAP-Is with the mutated prosequences, Δpro and M1, that were not secreted from S. cerevisiae. Δpro and M1 were synthesized at almost the same rate, but Δpro was degraded more rapidly than M1 in the cells. Therefore, the amount of M1 accumulated in the cells was more than that of Δpro. The subcellular fractionation analysis showed that both Δpro and M1 were recovered in the fractions that contained most of the activity of the ER marker enzyme, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. In addition, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-RNAP-I antisera demonstrated that Δpro localized in the ER. The staining pattern of Δpro did not change even in pep4 prb1 cells. Thus, it was presumed that vacuolar proteases did not take part in the degradation of Δpro. Consequently, we concluded that these RNAP-Is with the mutated prosequences were retained and degraded in the ER. It was revealed that denatured RNAP-I could renature in the presence of the wild-type prosequence in vitro, but not in the absence of the prosequence or in the presence of that of M1 (2Fukuda R. Horiuchi H. Ohta A. Takagi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9556-9561Google Scholar). Therefore, Δpro and M1 seem to be unable to have the correct tertiary structure in the ER lumen of S. cerevisiae. In this case, they would be recognized and degraded specifically by the degradation machinery in the ER. Our results presented in this paper support this hypothesis. However, it is not clear why Δpro is degraded more rapidly than M1. Δpro is deficient of the whole prosequence, while M1 has the only prosequence with 2 amino acids substituted. So, it is speculated that Δpro cannot have correctly folded structure in the ER lumen, whereas M1 may have partially folded structure. Therefore, Δpro may be more easily recognized or degraded by the degradation machinery in the ER than M1. Based on the results described in this paper, we propose a model for the transport, accumulation, and degradation of RNAP-I precursors in the ER lumen of S. cerevisiae. The wild-type precursor has the correct folding structure by the function of the prosequence and is secreted extracellularly. In contrast, Δpro and M1 cannot be folded correctly because of the mutations in their prosequences and are degraded in the ER by an unknown degradation mechanism. We are interested in the mechanism via which unfolded or malfolded proteins such as Δpro or M1 are recognized by the degradation machinery and in proteases that participate in the degradation of those proteins. We have isolated several mutants of S. cerevisiae that have deficiencies in the degradation of Δpro and accumulate Δpro in the cells, probably in the ER. 2R. Fukuda, K. Umebayashi, H. Horiuchi, A. Ohta, and M. Takagi, unpublished observation. It is expected that mutants defective in the recognition and/or degradation machinery in the ER would be present among them. Characterization of these mutants will be helpful to elucidate the mechanisms of recognition and degradation of proteins in the ER. We thank Dr. Takemitsu Mizunaga for providing anti-PDI antisera."
https://openalex.org/W2013646481,"Abstract Enzyme I (EI) of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS) is autocatalytically phosphorylated by P-enolpyruvate. We report here an ATP-dependent kinase (EI-K) from Escherichia coli that reversibly phosphorylates EI at its active site histidine; ATP and EI-K can therefore replace P-enolpyruvate. EI-K contains a bound cofactor that is lost during purification with concomitant loss of activity. NAD+ and NADP+ substitute for the cofactor and restore activity to the apoenzyme, whereas their analogues are inactive. The pyridine nucleotides do not activate EI-K by covalent modification (e.g. ADP-ribosylation), but must be present during the kinase reaction. NADH and NADPH are potent inhibitors of EI-K at all stages of purity, and enzyme activity in a mixture of NAD+ and NADH depends on the ratio of the two pyridine nucleotides. Inhibition is observed with reduced β-NMN and α-NADH, but neither is as effective as β-NADH. The reverse reaction, the transfer of the phosphoryl moiety from phospho-EI to ADP, also requires NAD+ or NADP+. In the absence of NAD+ or NADH, [32P]phospho-EI is hydrolyzed to 32Pi, suggesting that EI-K can act as a phospho-EI phosphatase. EI kinase may serve as a link between PTS-driven sugar transport and the electron transport chain."
https://openalex.org/W2095078885,"The Escherichia coli TolQ protein is a 230-amino acid integral cytoplasmic membrane protein required for the import of group A colicins, for infection by the filamentous phage, and for maintenance of the integrity of the bacterial envelope. TolQ is a polytopic protein with three membrane-spanning regions. The first membrane-spanning region has a 19-residue periplasmic NH2-terminal tail, while the second and third membrane-spanning segments are separated by a short 17-amino acid periplasmic loop. To study the membrane assembly of TolQ, fusions of different membrane-spanning regions were examined for their ability to insert in the absence of functional SecA or the membrane potential. Fusions containing the first membrane-spanning region plus the adjacent cytoplasmic domain and a construct containing the “hairpin loop,” formed by the second and third membrane-spanning regions, insert in the absence of functional SecA. The fusion containing the second and third membrane-spanning regions required the membrane potential for insertion while the first membrane-spanning region was able to insert even in the absence of a membrane potential. Taken together, these results suggest that insertion of intact TolQ is not dependent on the Sec system, but does require the membrane potential. The Escherichia coli TolQ protein is a 230-amino acid integral cytoplasmic membrane protein required for the import of group A colicins, for infection by the filamentous phage, and for maintenance of the integrity of the bacterial envelope. TolQ is a polytopic protein with three membrane-spanning regions. The first membrane-spanning region has a 19-residue periplasmic NH2-terminal tail, while the second and third membrane-spanning segments are separated by a short 17-amino acid periplasmic loop. To study the membrane assembly of TolQ, fusions of different membrane-spanning regions were examined for their ability to insert in the absence of functional SecA or the membrane potential. Fusions containing the first membrane-spanning region plus the adjacent cytoplasmic domain and a construct containing the “hairpin loop,” formed by the second and third membrane-spanning regions, insert in the absence of functional SecA. The fusion containing the second and third membrane-spanning regions required the membrane potential for insertion while the first membrane-spanning region was able to insert even in the absence of a membrane potential. Taken together, these results suggest that insertion of intact TolQ is not dependent on the Sec system, but does require the membrane potential. INTRODUCTIONThe TolQRA proteins are components of a bacterial system that is required for infection by filamentous phage and entry of the group A colicins (1Webster R.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1005-1011Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the tolQRA genes render the cells sensitive to detergents and permeable to periplasmic enzymes suggesting a loss of integrity in the outer membrane (2Lazzaroni J.C. Fognini-Lefebvre N. Portalier R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 218: 460-464Google Scholar, 3Fognini-Lefebvre N. Lazzaroni J.C. Portalier R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 209: 391-395Google Scholar). TolR and TolA are type II bitopic inner membrane proteins with most of the polypeptide comprising soluble periplasmic domains (4Muller M.M. Vianney A. Lazzaroni J.C. Webster R.E. Portalier R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6059-6061Google Scholar, 5Kampfenkel K. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4485-4491Google Scholar, 6Levengood S.K. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6600-6609Google Scholar). TolQ is a 230-amino acid protein which crosses the inner membrane three times. Its membrane topology was recently determined by protease accessibility and the analysis of TolQ fusion proteins (5Kampfenkel K. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4485-4491Google Scholar, 7Vianny A. Lewin T.M. Beyer Jr., W.F. Lazzaroni J.C. Portalier R. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 822-829Google Scholar). The first 19 amino-terminal residues and a short loop from amino acids 157–174 are exposed to the periplasm, while the carboxyl terminus and a large loop between the first and second membrane-spanning region are cytoplasmic (see Fig. 1). Amino-terminal sequence analysis of overexpressed TolQ purified from the inner membrane revealed the presence of the initiating formylmethionine, which suggests that TolQ is synthesized without a signal sequence and is rapidly inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane (7Vianny A. Lewin T.M. Beyer Jr., W.F. Lazzaroni J.C. Portalier R. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 822-829Google Scholar). In addition, overexpressed TolQ properly localizes to the cytoplasmic membrane and has no effect on cell growth. These characteristics raise the question whether the Sec system is required for TolQ membrane insertion.The role of Sec proteins in translocation of periplasmic proteins has been well characterized (reviewed in 8Schatz P.J. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 215-248Google Scholar and 9Wickner W. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 101-124Google Scholar). A number of intrinsic membrane proteins such as Lep, Tsr, and MtlA (10Wolfe P.B. Rice M. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1836-1841Google Scholar, 11Gebert J.F. Overhoff B. Manson M.D. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16652-16660Google Scholar, 12Werner P.K. Saier Jr., M.H. Muller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24523-24532Google Scholar) have also been shown to require the Sec system for proper insertion into the cytoplasmic membrane. However, other membrane proteins such as LacY, SecY, and M13 coat protein (10Wolfe P.B. Rice M. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1836-1841Google Scholar, 13Yamato I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 444-450Google Scholar, 14Swidersky U.E. Rienhofer-Schweer A. Werner P.K. Ernst F. Benson S.A. Hoffschulte H.K. Muller M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 803-811Google Scholar) do not require the Sec proteins for membrane insertion. On the basis of these and other observations, it has been proposed that inner membrane proteins which form “hairpin loops,” that is two membrane-spanning segments separated by a periplasmic domain of less than 60 residues, insert Sec independently (15von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 69-72Google Scholar). If the two membrane-spanning regions are separated by a larger periplasmic region, then the Sec system appears to be required for translocation. Additional observations suggest that the Sec system is not required for insertion of membrane-spanning segments which have unprocessed periplasmic amino termini (16Rohrer J. Kuhn A. Science. 1990; 250: 1418-1421Google Scholar, 17Cao G. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4662-4669Google Scholar, 18Whitley P. Zander T. Ehrmann M. Haardt M. Bremer E. von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4653-4661Google Scholar).The topology of the TolQ protein (Fig. 1) would suggest that both the first membrane-spanning region and the hairpin loop formed by the second and third membrane-spanning regions are inserted into the membrane independent of the Sec proteins. Experiments presented in this study demonstrate that all membrane-spanning regions of TolQ are translocated into the membrane independent of active SecA protein. In contrast, insertion of the second and third membrane-spanning regions requires the membrane potential, while the first inserts even in the absence of a membrane potential. These results are discussed in relation to the membrane assembly of TolQ.RESULTSTolQ is synthesized without a signal sequence and, once inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane, has very little of its sequence exposed to the periplasm (Fig. 1). One of these periplasmic regions is the amino-terminal 19 residues that still retains the initiating formylmethionine group (7Vianny A. Lewin T.M. Beyer Jr., W.F. Lazzaroni J.C. Portalier R. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 822-829Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the amino terminus and perhaps the other periplasmic region (residues 157–174) might be translocated across the membrane in a manner independent of the Sec system. To test this hypothesis, a number of TolQ fusion proteins were constructed (Fig. 1) and tested for their ability to be inserted into the membrane in the absence of functional SecA protein.Insertion of the First Membrane-spanning Region Is Sec-independent and Does Not Require the Membrane PotentialThe TolQ128 fusion protein has the amino-terminal 128 amino acids of TolQ fused to alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 1). This places alkaline phosphatase 81 residues to the carboxyl side of the first transmembrane region. Therefore the membrane-spanning region of the fusion protein might be expected to be presented to the membrane for insertion in the same manner as for the intact TolQ protein. A cellular fractionation experiment showed that approximately 65% of the fusion protein is localized to the inner membrane (Table I). The absence of alkaline phosphatase activity in cells synthesizing TolQ128 (Table I) confirms the cytoplasmic localization of the alkaline phosphatase moiety.Table I.Characteristics of TolQ fusion proteinsFusion proteinPlasmidAP activityaAlkaline phosphatase activity of intact cells (average from five experiments) corresponds to units of p-nitrophenylphosphate cleaved/min/cells/ml. − is <5; ++ is 20 to 40; +++ is 40 to 60; N/A = not applicable.LocalizationbBacteria were fractionated into cytoplasm (C), periplasm (P), inner membrane (IM), and outer membrane plus inclusion bodies (OM) in the presence or absence of 2 M NaBr.

Each fraction, containing material from the same number of cells, was analyzed by Western blot and quantitated by phosphorimaging as described under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab To test the necessity of the Sec sytem for insertion of TolQ128, inner membranes were isolated from K17 and K17secA bacteria following expression of TolQ128 for 10 min in the presence and absence of 1 mM azide. This low concentration of azide selectively inhibits the ATPase activity of SecA (19Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein from each inner membrane preparation were subjected to quantitative Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Quantitation of the radioactivity in the bands shows approximately 20% more TolQ128 is detected in the membranes isolated from the azide treated K17 cells (Fig. 2A, lane 2) as compared to that observed in untreated bacteria (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The TolQ128 present in azide-treated or untreated membranes was not removed by treatment with 2 M NaBr (data not shown), suggesting that TolQ128 is an integral membrane protein and spans the membrane with the proper orientation. The ability of TolQ128 to insert into the K17 cytoplasmic membrane when expressed in the presence of 1 mM azide, indicates that the first membrane-spanning region of TolQ does not require SecA for insertion. The presence of 1 mM azide inhibited normal SecA function as shown by the appearance of precursor to ribose binding protein in azide treated K17 bacteria (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Ribose binding protein is constitutively expressed and any precursor produced was the result of synthesis only during the 10-min period of azide treatment.Fig. 2Effect of azide and CCCP on TolQ128 insertion.Top, K17 (lanes 1 and 2) and K17secA (lanes 3 and 4) containing plasmid pTLQ128 were induced in the absence (lanes 1 and 3) and presence (lanes 2 and 4) of 1 mM azide. A, cytoplasmic membranes were isolated from an isopycnic sucrose gradient, and equal amounts of total protein from each membrane sample were subjected to 11% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibody to alkaline phosphatase. B, a sample of the harvested bacteria was subjected to 11% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using antibody to ribose binding protein (RBP). Bottom, K17 containing plasmid pTLQ128 were induced in the absence (lane 1) and presence (lane 2) of 50 µM CCCP. C, cytoplasmic membranes were isolated from an isopycnic sucrose gradient, and equal amounts of total protein from each membrane sample were subjected to 11% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibody to alkaline phosphatase. D, a sample of the harvested bacteria was subjected to 11% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using antibody to ribose binding protein (RBP).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The control strain, K17secA, carries a point mutation in secA (azi4) which allows for normal SecA ATPase activity in the presence of 1 mM azide (19Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Google Scholar). This mutant secA bacteria also exhibits normal growth in the presence of 1 mM azide. Membranes isolated from azide treated K17secA bacteria contained 92% of the TolQ128 detected in membranes from the untreated cells (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 3 and 4). This shows that azide alone does not affect membrane insertion. Azide treatment of K17secA bacteria also does not affect normal protein secretion as demonstrated by the absence of precursor to ribose binding protein in K17secA bacteria treated with 1 mM azide (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Ribose binding protein requires both an intact membrane potential (see below; Fig. 2D) and the ATPase activity of SecA for proper translocation.To examine the requirement for the membrane potential in the insertion of the first membrane-spanning region of TolQ128, half the culture was treated with 50 µM CCCP at the time of induction. Inner membranes were isolated and equal amounts of protein from each inner membrane sample were analyzed by Western blot with antibody to alkaline phosphatase. Quantitation of the blot shows that membranes from CCCP treated cells contain 83% of the amount of full length TolQ128 detected in membranes from untreated cells (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 2). The presence of 50 µM CCCP disrupted the membrane potential as shown by the appearance of precursor to ribose binding protein (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 1 and 2). Since TolQ128 can insert into the cytoplasmic membrane in the presence of CCCP, then the membrane potential is not an absolute requirement for insertion of the first membrane-spanning region of TolQ.The First Membrane-spanning Region Can also Function as a SecA-dependent Signal SequenceThe positively charged amino acids on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane-spanning region of TolQ128 might be responsible for the proper orientation and insertion of this region in the membrane. Removal of the cytoplasmic basic amino acids as in TolQ36 (Fig. 1) makes the NH2 terminus and first membrane-spanning region of TolQ look like a typical signal sequence. Expression of TolQ36 results in the bacteria exhibiting alkaline phosphatase activity (Table I). This activity is not due to translocation of the entire TolQ36 fusion to the periplasm, since no anti-alkaline phosphatase reactive species is detected in the periplasmic fraction (Table I). Since 50% of TolQ36 is localized to the inner membrane (Table I), it would seem that some TolQ36 can be inserted into the membrane in the opposite orientation to that determined for the NH2 terminus of wild type TolQ or TolQ128, resulting in the alkaline phosphatase moiety being exposed to the periplasm.The alkaline phosphatase moiety in TolQ36 is translocated in a SecA-dependent manner since the alkaline phosphatase activity observed in K17 bacteria is dramatically reduced in the presence of 1 mM azide (Fig. 3A, compare bars 1 and 2). Azide alone does not inhibit alkaline phosphatase activity, since in K17secA bacteria treated with 1 mM azide, the alkaline phosphatase activity only decreases 10% (Fig. 3A, bars 3 and 4). The loss of alkaline phosphatase activity observed in the presence of azide in K17 indicates that the translocation of alkaline phosphatase fused to residue 36 of TolQ proceeds in a SecA-dependent manner. However, TolQ36 is still inserted into the membrane in the presence of azide. Western blot analysis of K17 samples shows the same amount of TolQ36 is detected in the cytoplasmic membrane following treatment with azide (Fig. 3B, lane 2) or without azide (Fig. 3B, lane 1). Treatment with 2 M NaBr does not affect the amount of TolQ36 detected in inner membranes following induction in the presence or absence of azide (data not shown), suggesting that TolQ36 spans the membrane.Fig. 3Effect of azide on TolQ36 activity and insertion. K17 (bars and lanes 1 and 2) and K17secA (bars and lanes 3 and 4) containing plasmid pTLQ36 were induced in the absence (bars and lanes 1 and 3) and presence (bars and lanes 2 and 4) of 1 mM azide. A, alkaline phosphatase activity corresponds to units of p-nitrophenylphosphate cleaved/min/cells/ml. B, cytoplasmic membranes were isolated from an isopycnic sucrose gradient and equal amounts of total protein from each membrane sample were subjected to 11% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibody to alkaline phosphatase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The Second Membrane-spanning Region Can Function as an Internal Signal SequenceTolQ155 has alkaline phosphatase fused to residue 155 which lies at the COOH terminus of the second membrane-spanning region (region B in Fig. 1). Cellular fractionation shows that TolQ155 is found primarily (65%) in the inner membrane (Table I). Bacteria expressing TolQ155 have alkaline phosphatase activity (Table I) indicating a periplasmic localization for the alkaline phosphatase moiety.The SecA dependence for the insertion of the second membrane-spanning region in TolQ155 was examined by monitoring alkaline phosphatase activity following induction of TolQ155 in the presence and absence of 1 mM azide. In K17 bacteria, no alkaline phosphatase activity is observed when TolQ155 is expressed in the presence of 1 mM azide (Fig. 4A, bar 2), suggesting that SecA is required for the translocation of the alkaline phosphatase moiety into the periplasm.Fig. 4Effect of azide on TolQ155 activity and insertion. K17 (bars and lanes 1 and 2) and K17secA (bars and lanes 3 and 4) containing plasmid pTLQ155 were induced in the absence (bars and lanes 1 and 3) and presence (bars and lanes 2 and 4) of 1 mM azide. A, alkaline phosphatase activity corresponds to units of p-nitrophenylphosphate cleaved/min/cells/ml. B, cytoplasmic membranes were isolated from an isopycnic sucrose gradient and equal amounts of total protein from each sample were subjected to 11% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibody to alkaline phosphatase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We also examined the role of the membrane potential in translocation of the alkaline phosphatase moiety of TolQ155. No alkaline phosphatase activity is observed when TolQ155 is expressed in the presence of 50 µM CCCP (data not shown). The lack of alkaline phosphatase activity is not due to a block in protein synthesis, as analysis of whole bacteria shows that CCCP treated bacteria synthesize 80% of the amount of TolQ155 detected in untreated cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the membrane potential is required for the translocation of the alkaline phosphatase moiety of TolQ155 into the periplasm.The data presented above suggest that the Sec system is used for the insertion of the second membrane-spanning region of TolQ155 into the cytoplasmic membrane. These experiments do not address the role of the first membrane-spanning region in this process. To test whether the first membrane-spanning region affects the insertion of the second membrane-spanning region, an amino-terminal truncation of TolQ155 was made, generating TolQII (Fig. 1). Cellular fractionation shows that 60% of the TolQII synthesized is detected in the inner membrane (Table I). TolQII also has alkaline phosphatase activity (Table I) indicating a periplasmic localization for the alkaline phosphatase moiety.In K17 bacteria, induction of TolQII results in a two fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity above the uninduced level. When TolQII is induced in the presence of 1 mM azide no increase in alkaline phosphatase activity above the uninduced level is observed (data not shown). The absence of additional alkaline phosphatase activity following expression of TolQII in the presence of 1 mM azide, indicates that SecA is required for the translocation of the alkaline phosphatase moiety into the periplasm. This result is consistent with the result obtained for TolQ155 and suggests that the absence of the first membrane-spanning region of TolQ has little effect on the insertion of the second membrane-spanning region fused to alkaline phosphatase.Although the above data are consistent with SecA being required for insertion of the second membrane-spanning region of TolQ155 into the membrane, it does not address the question of whether insertion of this transmembrane domain affects the mode of insertion of the first membrane-spanning region. Therefore, we analyzed the cellular location of TolQ155 produced in K17 bacteria in the presence or absence of 1 mM azide. A Western blot of K17 inner membrane samples shows that 45% less TolQ155 is present following azide treatment (Fig. 4B, lane 2) as compared to that detected in the untreated sample (Fig. 4B, lane 1). Azide treatment did not affect the expression of TolQ155 as measured by Western blot analysis of whole cell samples (data not shown). Therefore, the decrease in the amount of inner membrane TolQ155 detected following azide treatment suggests that efficient insertion of the first membrane-spanning region may depend on the insertion of the second membrane-spanning region. In the control strain, K17secA, 15% more TolQ155 is detected in the inner membrane in the presence of 1 mM azide (Fig. 4B, lane 4) than in the absence of azide (Fig. 4B, lane 3).The Second and Third Membrane-spanning Regions Insert in a Sec-independent MannerThe experiments with TolQ155 suggest that the second membrane-spanning region behaves as a Sec-dependent internal signal sequence. However, the TolQ155 construct does not mimic the actual membrane topology for TolQ, which have the second and third membrane-spanning segments (Fig. 1, regions B and C) connected by a short (17-amino acid) periplasmic loop. It has recently been shown that Sec-independent insertion of such hairpin loops requires both membrane-spanning regions (26Cao G. Cheng S. Whitley P. von Heijne G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26898-26903Google Scholar). To test the insertion characteristics of the combined second and third membrane-spanning regions of TolQ, amino acids 113–197 were inserted into the middle of EcoRI endonuclease to create TolQII/III (Fig. 1). Cellular fractionation indicated that at least 50% of TolQII/III is inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane (Table I). Treatment with 2 M NaBr does not remove TolQII/III from the membrane suggesting that TolQII/III spans the inner membrane. The 20% found in the outer membrane fraction was the result of inclusion body formation.The membrane topology of TolQII/III was verified by a trypsin accessibility experiment. Previous studies have shown that TolQ is only partially susceptible to trypsin at very high concentrations (>100 µg/ml) (5Kampfenkel K. Braun V. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4485-4491Google Scholar, 7Vianny A. Lewin T.M. Beyer Jr., W.F. Lazzaroni J.C. Portalier R. Webster R.E. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 822-829Google Scholar) and that EcoRI endonuclease is trypsin sensitive (22Horabin J.I. Webster R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11575-11583Google Scholar). Therefore, if TolQII/III adopts a hairpin loop conformation in the membrane it should be resistant to digestion at low concentrations of trypsin. To test this hypothesis, bacteria expressing TolQII/III were either plasmolyzed or lysed, and then treated with 10 µg/ml trypsin. A Western blot with antibody against EcoRI endonuclease shows that trypsin was unable to digest TolQII/III in plasmolyzed cells (Fig. 5, lane 2), while trypsin completely digested the fusion protein in lysed cells (Fig. 5, lane 3). As a control, C1S (22Horabin J.I. Webster R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11575-11583Google Scholar), an EcoRI fusion protein with a single membrane-spanning region (Fig. 1), was subjected to the same trypsin digestion. Trypsin treatment of plasmolyzed cells resulted in digestion of the periplasmically exposed COOH terminus of the 51-kDa C1S protein to yield a 30-kDa protected fragment (Fig. 5, compare lanes 4 and 5). These results suggest that TolQII/III adopts a membrane conformation similar to that predicted for the second and third membrane-spanning regions of TolQ.Fig. 5Trypsin digestion of TolQII/III. K91 containing plasmid pTLQ023 (lanes 1–3) or plasmid pC1S (lanes 4 and 5) were induced for the synthesis of TolQII/III or C1S, respectively. Cells were plasmolyzed (lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5) or lysed (lane 3) and incubated in the absence (lanes 1 and 4) or presence (lanes 2, 3, and 5) of 10 µg/ml trypsin. Equal amounts of cellular material were subjected to 11% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibody against EcoRI endonuclease. The open arrow indicates the position of the 30-kDa C1S protected fragment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TolQII/III was used to examine the SecA-dependence of the insertion of the second and third membrane-spanning regions of TolQ. Quantitative Western blot analysis of inner membranes from azide treated K17 cells, showed that they contained 90% of the amount of TolQII/III detected in membranes from untreated cells (Fig. 6A, compare lanes 1 and 2). Membrane-associated TolQII/III in azide-treated bacteria was not removed by treatment with 2 M NaBr (data not shown) and is trypsin-resistant in plasmolyzed bacteria. This suggests that TolQII/III expressed in the presence of azide adopts the correct membrane topology. In azide-resistant cells, azide treatment results in only a 20% decrease in the amount of inner membrane TolQII/III detected (Fig. 6A, lane 4). The ability of TolQII/III to insert properly in the absence of functional SecA indicates that the second and third membrane-spanning regions of TolQ insert in a SecA-independent manner.Fig. 6Effect of azide and CCCP on TolQII/III insertion.A, K17 (lanes 1 and 2) and K17secA (lanes 3 and 4) containing plasmid pTLQ023 were induced for the synthesis of TolQII/III in the absence (lanes 1 and 3) and presence (lanes 2 and 4) of 1 mM azide. Cytoplasmic membranes were isolated from an isopycnic sucrose gradient and equal amounts of total protein from each membrane sample were subjected to 11% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with antibody to EcoRI endonuclease.

A sample of the harvested bacteria (lanes 3 and 4) was also subjected to Western blot analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)K17 bacteria expressing TolQII/III were also treated with 50 µM of the protonophore CCCP. Inner membranes were isolated and equal amounts of protein from each inner membrane preparation were subjected to Western blot analysis. No TolQII/III was detected in the CCCP treated sample (Fig. 6B, lane 2). CCCP treatment did not affect the expression of TolQII/III as illustrated by the presence of a band corresponding to TolQII/III in a whole cell sample (Fig. 6B, lane 4). The absence of inner membrane TolQII/III following CCCP treatment indicates that the membrane potential is required for the insertion of the hairpin loop formed by the second and third membrane-spanning regions.Overexpression of TolQ Does Not Affect Correct Protein LocalizationOur experiments with the TolQ fusions suggest that TolQ is inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane independently of functional SecA protein. To assess the effects of TolQ overexpression on the translocation of Sec-dependent proteins, K17(DE3) bacteria containing plasmid pTLQHis were treated with 2 mM IPTG to induce synthesis of TolQ. Forty minutes following induction, TolQ can be detected on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel by Coomassie stain (Fig. 7, upper panel). At this point, the production of maltose binding protein (MBP) was induced by the addition of maltose to the culture medium. The processing of MBP was monitored by Western blot, and no precursor was detected (Fig. 7, lower panel). Precursor is observed only following treatment with 1 mM azide (Fig. 7, lower panel, lane AZ) which inhibits Sec-dependent translocation. Western blot analysis with antibody to SecA was also performed on th"
