Herein we demonstrate that exposing muscle cells to particular saturated free fatty acids (FFAs), but not mono-unsaturated FFAs, inhibits insulin stimulation of Akt/protein kinase B, a serine/threonine kinase that is a central mediator of insulin-stimulated anabolic metabolism. These saturated FFAs concomitantly induced the accumulation of ceramide and diacylglycerol, two products of fatty acyl-CoA that have been shown to accumulate in insulin-resistant tissues and to inhibit early steps in insulin signaling. Preventing de novo ceramide synthesis negated the antagonistic effect of saturated FFAs toward Akt/protein kinase B. Moreover, inducing ceramide buildup recapitulated and augmented the inhibitory effect of saturated FFAs. By contrast, diacylglycerol proved dispensable for these FFA effects. Collectively these results identify ceramide as a necessary and sufficient intermediate linking saturated fats to the inhibition of insulin signaling.

In certain pathological conditions, including Type 2 diabetes mellitus (1Saltiel A.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 517-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) and metabolic syndrome X (2Hansen B.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 892: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), these tissues become resistant to insulin such that a maximal dose of the hormone is unable to elicit these anabolic responses. Numerous studies suggest that the oversupply of lipid to peripheral tissues might contribute to the development of this insulin resistance. First, insulin-resistant subjects frequently display signs of abnormal lipid metabolism including obesity (3Boden G. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), increased circulating free fatty acid (FFA)1 concentrations (4Reaven G.M. Hollenbeck C. Jeng C.Y. Wu M.S. Chen Y.D.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). In fact, the size of the intramyocellular lipid depot correlates more tightly with the severity of insulin resistance than most known risk factors (6McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Second, experimentally exposing peripheral tissues to lipids decreases their sensitivity to insulin. For example, (a) incubating isolated muscle strips or cultured muscle cells with FFAs (7Hunnicutt J.W. Hardy R.W. Williford J. McDonald J.M.

These observations have prompted investigators to hypothesize that increased availability of lipids to peripheral tissues causes insulin resistance, perhaps by promoting the accumulation of one or more fat-derived metabolites capable of inhibiting insulin action (6McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 18Schmitz-Peiffer C. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 583-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric tyrosine kinase receptor that mediates all of the anabolic effects of insulin (19Rosen O.M. Science. 1987; 237: 1452-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The activated receptor phosphorylates intracellular docking molecules (termed insulin receptor substrates, or IRS proteins) that recruit and stimulate multiple different effector enzymes (20White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase is a target of IRS proteins that is an obligate intermediate in the metabolic, anti-apoptotic, and mitogenic effects of insulin (21Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase phosphorylates specific phosphoinositides to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate, which subsequently recruit cytosolic serine/threonine kinases phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) to the plasma membrane. The association between these phosphoinositides and the Akt/PKB pleckstrin homology domain promotes Akt/PKB activation by facilitating its phosphorylation on two regulatory residues (i.e. Ser-473 and Thr-308) (22Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Studies in cultured cells involving the overexpression of constitutively active (23Kohn A.D. Summers S.A.

Clark S.F. Tucker D.F. Birnbaum M.J. James D.E. Macaulay S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7771-7781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate the involvement of the enzyme in the regulation of anabolic metabolism. Moreover, knockout mice lacking the Akt2/PKBβ isoform develop a diabetes-like syndrome characterized by insulin resistance in both skeletal muscle and liver (27Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L.

The molecular mechanisms linking FFAs to the inhibition of insulin action remain unclear. In 1963, Randle et al. (28Randle P.J. Garland P.B. Hales L.N. Newsholme E.A. Lancet. 1963; i: 785-789Abstract Scopus (3795) Google Scholar) proposed the existence of a glucose-fatty acid cycle by which glucose and lipids could serve as competitive substrates for oxidation in muscle. More recent studies in either cultured cells (9Schmitz-Peiffer C. Craig D.L. Bidn T.J. J. Biol.

As shown herein, the saturated fats palmitate and stearate, but not their mono-unsaturated counterparts oleate and palmitoleate, blocked insulin activation of Akt/PKB while concomitantly promoting the accumulation of ceramide and diacylglycerol in C2C12 myotubes. These lipid metabolites have both been shown to accumulate in tissues from insulin-resistant rodents (31Turinsky J. O'Sullivan D.M. Bayly B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16880-16885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to inhibit insulin signal transduction in cultured cells (32Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Zhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell.

Specifically, studies with short chain ceramide analogs reveal that ceramide prevents insulin activation of Akt/PKB (32Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Zhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell.

Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2563-2571Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), whereas investigations with phorbol esters, which mimic the effects of diacylglycerol (DAG), indicate that DAG blocks upstream signaling events by promoting the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (38Kellerer M.

Using various methods for manipulating either the synthesis or breakdown of ceramide, we found that endogenously produced ceramide was both sufficient and necessary for the inhibition of insulin signaling by palmitate. Moreover, we determined that DAG was dispensable for the inhibitory palmitate effects. These findings implicate ceramide as a potentially important intermediate linking saturated fats to the development of insulin resistance. C2-ceramide anddl-threo-1-Phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP) were obtained from Calbiochem, okadaic acid was from Invitrogen, fetal bovine serum was from Atlas Biologicals (Fort Collins, CO), and silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were from Merck. The following additional reagents were obtained from Sigma: palmitate, stearate, oleate, palmitoleate, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, C-6 ceramide, C-16 ceramide, C-18 ceramide, fumonisin B1, myriocin, cycloserine, andN-oleoylethanolamine). Antibodies utilized included rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) and anti-phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (serine 9) antibodies from Cell Signaling, mouse anti-glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) antibody from Transduction Labs (Lexington, KY), rabbit anti-phospho-mitogen-activated protein kinase antibody from Promega(Madison, WI), rabbit polyclonal anti-Akt, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). C2C12 myoblasts were maintained at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For differentiation into myotubes, the myoblasts were grown to confluency, and the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% horse serum. Myotubes were used for experiments 4 days after differentiation. Free fatty acids were administered to cells by conjugating them with FFA-free bovine serum albumin. Briefly, FFAs were dissolved in ethanol and diluted 1:100 in 1% FBS-DMEM containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Two hours before performing the experiments, myotubes were placed in serum free-DMEM containing 2% bovine serum albumin in either the presence or absence of FFAs. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using methods described previously (43Summers S.A. Lipfert L. Birnbaum M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Detection was done using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence or the Enhanced Chemiluminescence Plus kit fromAmersham Biosciences according to the manufacturer's instructions. PI 3-kinase activity was assessed using the methodology of Summers et al.(44Summers S.A. Kao A.W. Kohn A.D. Backus G.S. Roth R.A. Pessin J.E. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17934-17940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Myotubes were lysed in ice-cold 1m NaCl (0.25 ml) and transferred to glass tubes. Ice cold CHCl3/CH3OH (1:2, v/v, 0.75 ml) was added, and the suspension was vortexed vigorously. After the subsequent addition of 0.25 ml of 1 m NaCl and 0.25 ml of CHCl3, phases were separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm (2000 ×g) for 5 min. Ceramide content in the extract was determined using a radiometric diacylglycerol assay kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Small T cDNA served as a template for PCR amplification. The upstream primer (5′-AGATCTATGGATAAAGTTTTAAACAG-3′) incorporated a BglII site and an ATG start codon, and the downstream primer (5′-CTCGAGTTAGAGCTTTAAATCTCT-3′) was engineered with a XhoI site. The amplified products were cloned directly into TOPO2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced in both directions to confirm that no errors were introduced by PCR. The small T TOPO2.1 cDNA was digested with BglII and XhoI, and the approximate 0.5-kilobase small T fragment was gel-purified and subcloned into the pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector (45Minamide L.S. Shaw A.E. Sarmiere P.D. Wiggan O. Maloney M.T. Bernstein B.W. Sneidier J.M. Gonzalez J.A. Bamburg J.R. Methods Cell Biol. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses were generated by homologous recombination after electroporation of small T with pAdEASY-1 into RecA+ bacteria (BJ5183). Bacterial clones containing recombinant adenoviral DNA were verified by restriction digestion with PacI, and recombinant viruses were generated by transfection of HEK 293 cells. Virus was amplified by four rounds of infection and purified from 20 × 15-cm plates of HEK 293 cells using two rounds of centrifugation through CsCl gradients. The residual CsCl was removed by dialysis against 10% glycerin in phosphate-buffered saline in a Slide-a-Lyzer cassette. Virus was titered using the methods of Minamide et al. (45Minamide L.S. Shaw A.E. Sarmiere P.D. Wiggan O. Maloney M.T. Bernstein B.W. Sneidier J.M. Gonzalez J.A. Bamburg J.R. Methods Cell Biol. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and myotubes were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Under these conditions, greater than 80% of the myotubes expressed the green fluorescent protein protein, which is also encoded by the recombinant adenovirus. Experiments were performed 48 h after infection. To identify specific FFAs capable of antagonizing insulin signal transduction, we evaluated the effect of specific saturated and monounsaturated FFAs on insulin-stimulated Akt/PKB phosphorylation and activation in C2C12 myotubes. Palmitate (C16:0) and stearate (C18:0), which comprise greater than 90% of the saturated FFAs in human serum (46Raatz S.K. Bibus D. Thomas W. Kris-Etherton P. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), each markedly inhibited insulin stimulation of Akt/PKB phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). By contrast, neither oleate (C18:1), which makes up 80% of the circulating monounsaturated pool (46Raatz S.K. Bibus D. Thomas W. Kris-Etherton P. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), nor palmitoleate (C16:1), had any effect (Fig. 1 A). Palmitate and stearate also inhibited insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK3β (Fig. 1 A), a substrate of Akt/PKB with numerous functions including the regulation of glycogen synthase activity (44Summers S.A. Kao A.W. Kohn A.D. Backus G.S. Roth R.A. Pessin J.E. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17934-17940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Palmitate inhibited Akt/PKB phosphorylation within 2–4 h (Fig. 1 B) at a FFA concentration as low as 0.25 mm (Fig. 1 C). This concentration is comparable with that found physiologically (9Schmitz-Peiffer C. Craig D.L. Bidn T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24202-24210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and is similar to that used in prior studies evaluating FFA effects in both immortalized muscle cells (9Schmitz-Peiffer C.

Metab. 2000; 279: 577-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neither palmitate nor stearate inhibited IRS1-associated PI 3-kinase (Fig. 2).Figure 2Palmitate and stearate do not inhibit IRS1-associated PI 3-kinase activity. C2C12 myotubes were incubated in the presence or absence of the indicated fatty acids (16 h, 0.75 mm) before stimulation with insulin (Ins, 100 nm, 10 min). IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and incubated with [32P]ATP and phosphoinositide. Lipids were extracted and resolved by thin layer chromatography. Phosphoinositide 3-phosphate (PI (3)P) produced by the phosphorylation of phosphoinositide by PI 3-kinase was visualized using a Storm PhosphorImager. Data are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next determined whether the inhibitory FFAs also induced the accumulation of DAG and/or ceramide. Briefly, DAG kinase can phosphorylate both DAG and ceramide to produce phosphatidic acid and ceramide 1-phosphate, respectively, which can be resolved by TLC. When the reaction is allowed to proceed in the presence of [32P]ATP, the phosphorylated products can be detected using a Storm PhosphorImager (47Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 22-31Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, palmitate and stearate induced ceramide accumulation ∼3-fold over basal levels (Fig. 3 A), whereas they induced DAG accumulation ∼6- and 3.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 3 B). By contrast, neither oleate nor palmitoleate had any effect on either ceramide or DAG accumulation. Interestingly, another saturated FFA, myristate (14:0), induced DAG synthesis while having no effect on ceramide accumulation or Akt/PKB or GSK3β phosphorylation (data not shown). As described earlier, ceramide blocks insulin signaling by preventing the activation of Akt/PKB (9Schmitz-Peiffer C. Craig D.L. Bidn T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24202-24210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 32Summers S.A. Garza L.A. Zhou H. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5457-5464Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), whereas DAG inhibits “upstream” signaling events (i.e. insulin stimulation of IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase (38Kellerer M. Mushack J. Seffer E. Mischak H. Ullrich A. Haring H.U. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 39Danielsen A.G. Liu F. Hosomi Y. Shii K. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

(Noisy-le-Grand). 2001; 47: 1059-1062PubMed Google Scholar)). Because palmitate also inhibited Akt/PKB but not PI 3-kinase (Fig. 2), we hypothesized that ceramide and not DAG was the principal effector linking saturated FFAs to the inhibition of Akt/PKB. To test this hypothesis, we determined whether inhibitors of de novo ceramide synthesis could prevent palmitate inhibition of insulin signaling. Briefly, ceramide biosynthesis requires the coordinate action of two enzymes,i.e. serine palmitoyltransferase and ceramide synthase (for review, see Ref. 48Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25843-25846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Serine palmitoyltransferase catalyzes the initial step, which involves the condensation of serine and palmitoyl-CoA to form 3-ketosphinganine, a sphingolipid that is subsequently reduced to form the sphingoid base sphinganine. Ceramide synthase catalyzes sphinganine acylation, producing dihydroceramide, which is then converted to ceramide by the introduction of a trans-4,5 double bond in the sphinganine moiety. Pretreating C2C12 myotubes with myriocin, a fungal toxin that inhibits serine palmitoyltransferase, completely prevented the palmitate-induced increase in ceramide levels (Fig. 4 A) but had no effect on DAG accumulation (Fig. 4 B). As predicted, myriocin completely negated the inhibitory effect of palmitate on both Akt/PKB and GSK3β phosphorylation (Fig.5 A). Similarly, cycloserine, another serine palmitoyltransferase inhibitor, also reversed the palmitate effect on Akt/PKB phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). Fumonisin B1, a fungal toxin that inhibits ceramide synthase, also prevented the palmitate effect on ceramide (Fig. 4 A), but not DAG (Fig. 4 B), accumulation. Like myriocin and cycloserine, fumonisin B1 protected both Akt/PKB and GSK3β from the inhibitory effects of palmitate (Fig. 5 C). Myriocin, cycloserine, or fumonisin B1 did not affect the expression or the basal or insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of either Akt/PKB or GSK3β (data not shown). Moreover, myriocin and fumonisin B1 did not prevent the inhibition of Akt/PKB phosphorylation by exogenous C2-ceramide (data not shown).Figure 5Myriocin, cycloserine, and fumonisin B1 prevent the inhibition of insulin signaling by palmitate. C2C12 myotubes were incubated in the presence or absence of palmitate (8 h, 0.75 mm) before stimulation with insulin (100 nm, 10 min). Selected samples were treated with or without the serine palmitoyltransferase inhibitors PaI, myriocin (10 μm), or cycloserine (1 mm) or the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 (FB1, 50 μm) just before adding palmitate. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence. Data are representative of at least four independent experiments. P, phospho-.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Most of the work revealing that ceramide inhibits Akt/PKB relies on the use of short chain ceramide analogs, which are questionable in terms of their ability to mimic endogenous ceramide (49Van Blitterswijk W.J. Van Der Luit A.H. Veldman R.J. Verheij M. Borst J. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Moreover, both C2-ceramide and endogenously produced ceramide can be rapidly deacylated and glucosylated to give rise to a broad array of sphingolipid-derived molecules (for review, see Ref. 48Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25843-25846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Thus, two questions remained. First, could endogenous ceramide mimic the effects of both C2-ceramide and palmitate; second, is ceramide itself or, alternatively, another ceramide metabolite, the principal mediator of the inhibitory effects of palmitate. To address this issue, we treated cells with inhibitors of ceramide glucosylation (i.e. the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor PDMP) or deacylation (i.e. the ceramidase inhibitorN-oleoylethanolamine). These compounds were shown previously to increase endogenous ceramide levels by blocking its normal route(s) of metabolism (50Rani C.S. Abe A. Chang Y. Rosenzweig N. Saltiel A.R. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2859-2867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Treating C2C12 myotubes with either compound increased cellular ceramide to levels comparable with those achieved with palmitate alone (Fig.6 A), and both drugs markedly inhibited insulin-stimulated Akt/PKB phosphorylation (Fig.6 B). Neither drug affected the expression of Akt or GSK3β (data not shown). Thus, increasing endogenous ceramide levels by an alternative mechanism recapitulated the inhibitory effects of palmitate on Akt/PKB phosphorylation. We next attempted to determine whether these drugs, by blocking ceramide glucosylation or deacylation, could actually augment the palmitate effect on either the accumulation of long chain ceramides or the antagonism of insulin signaling. As predicted, the inclusion of either PDMP orN-oleoylethanolamine along with palmitate potentiated the effects of either reagent individually on both ceramide accumulation (Fig. 6 A) and the inhibition of Akt/PKB phosphorylation (Fig. 6, C and D). Ceramide has been shown to prevent Akt/PKB activation by at least two independent mechanisms. In certain cell types, okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), negates the antagonistic effects of ceramide on Akt/PKB. This finding suggests that ceramide blocks insulin action by accelerating the rate of Akt/PKB dephosphorylation (34Teruel T. Hernandez R. Lorenzo M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2563-2571Crossref"

This protein kinase has been implicated in insulin signaling, stimulation of cellular growth, and inhibition of apoptosis as well as transformation of cells. Although a number of cellular proteins have been identified as putative targets of the enzyme, additional substrates may play a role in the varied responses elicited by this enzyme. We have used a combination of 14-3-3 binding and recognition by an antibody to the phosphorylation consensus of the enzyme to identify and isolate one of the major substrates of Akt, which is also a 14-3-3 binding protein. This 40-kDa protein, designated PRAS40, is a proline-rich Akt substrate. Demonstration that it is a substrate of Akt was accomplished by showing that 1) PRAS40 was phosphorylated in vitro by purified Akt on the same site that was phosphorylated in insulin-treated cells; 2) activation of an inducible Akt was alone sufficient to stimulate the phosphorylation of PRAS40; and 3) cells lacking Akt1 and Akt2 exhibit a diminished ability to phosphorylate this protein. Thus, PRAS40 is a novel substrate of Akt, the phosphorylation of which leads to the binding of this protein to 14-3-3.

A number of approaches have implicated this pathway in the subsequent responses elicited by this hormone. One of the major downstream targets of the lipid products generated by this enzyme (PI 3,4,5-P and PI 3,4-P) is the Ser/Thr kinase called Akt or protein kinase B. Which of the particular responses elicited by the PI 3-kinase are actually caused by Akt has been the subject of numerous studies, and these works have implicated Akt in many of the responses including stimulation of glucose uptake and cell growth as well as inhibition of apoptosis (3Cho H.

The binding of 14-3-3 to a protein also has been proposed to regulate either the proteolysis and/or the phosphorylation state of the bound protein. Most important for the purposes of the present discussion has been the finding that the 14-3-3 proteins bind to phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-containing motifs in a sequence-specific manner (15Tzivion G.

The particular motif recognized by these proteins includes the consensus phosphorylation site of Akt, a phosphorylated Ser/Thr with an Arg residue present at position −3 or −4. In the present work we have used a combination of the 14-3-3 protein and anti-pAkt substrate antibodies (18Zhang H. Zha X. Tan Y. Hornbeck P.V. Mastrangelo A.J. Alessi D.R. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J.

The major 14-3-3 binding protein observed in cells after insulin treatment was a 40-kDa molecule. This protein (designated PRAS40) was purified, sequenced, and identified as a proline-rich molecule without any major homology to other proteins in the data base and also lacking any recognizable domains. We have demonstrated that this protein is a substrate of Akt by showing that it can be phosphorylated in vitro with purified Akt, that the activation of an inducible Akt (called mer-Akt) (19Kohn A.D.

Isoelectrofocusing strips, pH 3–10, were Immobilon (13 cm) from Amersham Biosciences. A peptide containing the carboxyl-terminal 19 residues of PRAS40 (DLPRPRLNTSDFQKLKRKY) was synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used to generate a polyclonal rabbit antibody to PRAS40 by BioCarta (Carlsbad, CA). Confluent 150-mm dishes of H4IIE cells were treated without or with 100 nminsulin for 10 min and then lysed with lysis buffer (50 mmHEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium ortho-vanadate, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm NaF, 100 nm okadaic acid, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated with 14-3-3-GST bound to glutathione-agarose beads at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.6, and the bound proteins eluted by the addition of 1 ml of 0.5% Empigen BB. Eluted proteins were concentrated with the Page Perfect kit (Geno Technology Inc.) and then analyzed or purified on either SDS-PAGE gels or via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. To find the position of the PRAS40 band, gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with anti-pAkt substrate antibody. The PRAS40 bands were digested with trypsin, and the tryptic peptides were sequenced by microcapillary liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry on an ion trap mass spectrometer at both Thermo Finnigan and the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. An EST containing the entire coding region of the human cDNA (GenBankTM accession number BC007416, IMAGE clone number 2988648) was purchased (Incyte Genomics) and amplified via PCR with the addition of a BamHI site (5′) and anEcoRI site (3′) and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen) containing either an amino-terminal Myc tag or a carboxyl-terminal HA tag for mammalian cell expression. For bacterial expression as a GST fusion protein, the full-length construct was also subcloned into pGEX-KG vector (a modification of pGEX-2T, obtained from R. Scheller, Amersham Biosciences). Site-directed mutagenesis of Thr-246 was performed using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The cDNA encoding the Myc-tagged PRAS40 (wt and mutant) was also subcloned into pWZL-blasticidin S retroviral vectors (provided by Dr. Nolan, Stanford University). PRAS40 (wt or mutant) was expressed by either transient transfection in human embryonic kidney cells (293t) or by stable expression after retroviral infection of NIH3T3-MER cells. In some experiments the PRAS40 was co-transfected with epitope-tagged constitutively active Akt as indicated. Cells were lysed as described above, and either the total lysates were analyzed or the PRAS40 was precipitated with either an antibody to the epitope tag or an antibody to the PRAS40 protein. The pGEX-PRAS40 construct was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(RIL) (Stratagene) and purified and injected into rabbits (Lampire) for antibody production. An antibody that recognizes PRAS40 when it is phosphorylated on Thr-246 (anti-pPRAS40) was obtained from BIOSOURCE(Camarillo, CA). This rabbit polyclonal antibody was affinity-purified using both negative and positive affinity purification methods to optimize specificity for the targeted phosphoepitope. The full-length PRAS40 cDNA was isolated and gel-purified, and 100 ng of DNA were labeled by the random primer labeling system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A human tissue mRNA blot (HB-2010; Origene Technologies, Inc.) was probed with the labeled PRAS40 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The labeled bands were detected by autoradiography. An epitope-tagged constitutively active Akt (myr-Akt) was precipitated from transfected cells with anti-HA antibody 12CA5 adsorbed to protein A-agarose beads. The precipitated kinase was incubated with 4 μg of purified PRAS40-GST fusion protein or GST alone for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2 and either 5 μm ATP (containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]-ATP) or 2.5 mm ATP. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and either autoradiography or immunoblotting with anti-pAkt substrate antibody, respectively. Total cell lysates of control or insulin-treated H4IIE cells or PRAS40 precipitates from PC-3 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline buffer, membranes were incubated with purified 14-3-3-GST (10 μg/ml). Bound 14-3-3-GST was detected using either an anti-GST (Covance) or an anti-14-3-3 antibody (Santa Cruz) and the appropriate secondary antibody. A rat hepatoma, H4IIE, was treated with insulin and lysed, and the lysates were either probed directly or after purification on a 14-3-3 affinity column with an antibody directed against the phosphorylation motif of Akt substrates (18Zhang H. Zha X. Tan Y. Hornbeck P.V. Mastrangelo A.J. Alessi D.R. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39379-39387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In total lysates, several proteins of various molecular masses were detected with this antibody with the major band at 25-kDa (Fig. 1 a), presumably ribosomal protein S6 (18Zhang H. Zha X. Tan Y. Hornbeck P.V. Mastrangelo A.J. Alessi D.R. Polakiewicz R.D. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39379-39387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). However, after elution from the 14-3-3 affinity column, the major band detected was a 40-kDa molecule (Fig.1 a). This protein was not bound by a mutant 14-3-3 (Arg-56 and -60 changed to Ala) that lacks the ability to bind phosphorylated peptides (17Thorson J.A. Yu L.W. Hsu A.L. Shih N.Y. Graves P.R. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Piwnica-Worms H. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5229-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To look for other proteins that could bind to 14-3-3 in the total lysates but that may not have been recovered in the 14-3-3 affinity column, total lysates from insulin-treated cells were probed with the 14-3-3 in a far Western. Again, the major insulin-stimulated 14-3-3 binding protein observed in the total lysates was a 40-kDa protein (Fig. 1 b). To determine which signal cascade was responsible for the insulin-stimulated increase in 14-3-3 binding to the 40-kDa protein, H4IIE cells were treated with various inhibitors before insulin stimulation. Wortmannin, an inhibitor of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, was found to largely block the insulin-stimulated increase in phosphorylated 40-kDa protein in the 14-3-3 eluates. In contrast, rapamycin, an inhibitor of the downstream kinase mammalian target of rapamycin, had only a slight effect on the amount of phosphorylated 40-kDa protein detected (Fig. 1 c). In contrast, an inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (PD 098059) had no effect on the phosphorylation of the 40-kDa protein (data not shown). To further characterize this 40-kDa protein, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used. The isoelectric point (pI) of the protein was estimated by this procedure to be ∼4.5 (Fig. 1 d). This point was considerably different from any previously identified substrate of Akt in this size range (i.e.glycogen synthase kinase-3β has a pI of 8.9). A similar 14-3-3-binding protein was also observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well as in various transformed cells like the prostate cancer cell line PC-3 (data not shown). The above results suggested that the 40-kDa protein may be a novel substrate of Akt and a major 14-3-3 binding protein. We therefore isolated sufficient amounts of this protein for tryptic digestion and identification by mass spectrometry. Five peptides from the isolated protein were found to match a predicted mouse protein gi:12834425 of unknown function and a predictedM r of 27,500 and pI of 4.6. A human homolog (gi:14150199) of this protein was also present in the EST data base. The deduced sequences of these proteins contained a consensus Akt phosphorylation site (Thr-246) but no other recognizable motif (Fig.2). It was, however, highly proline-rich, with 15% of its amino acids being proline (versus 5% for a typical protein), and these proline-rich regions are potential SH3 and/or WW domain binding partners (21Macias M.J. Wiesner S. Sudol M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The protein has therefore been named PRAS40, for proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa. PRAS40 was first expressed as a GST fusion protein inE. coli. This fusion protein was found to be phosphorylated by Akt in vitro, either by inclusion of radioactive ATP in the kinase reaction and autoradiography (Fig.3 a) or by reaction with the anti-pAkt substrate antibody used to screen the total cell lysates (Fig. 3 b). These results indicate that PRAS40 is readily phosphorylated in vitro and that this phosphorylation leads to the recognition of PRAS40 by the anti-pAkt substrate antibody. The PRAS40-GST protein was also used to generate a polyclonal antibody to the protein. This antibody was capable of immunoprecipitating from lysates of insulin-treated H4IIE cells a protein that ran in an identical position on SDS-PAGE as the 14-3-3 bound material and the phosphorylation of which was stimulated by insulin (Fig.4 a). In addition, an identical anti-pAkt substrate-reactive band was immunoprecipitated with an antibody generated to the carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acids of the deduced sequence of PRAS40 (Fig. 4 a). The antibody to PRAS40 also immunoprecipitated a similar band, the phosphorylation of which was stimulated by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig.4 b). An HA-epitope-tagged version of PRAS40 was also expressed transiently in human embryonic kidney cells (293 cells). Lysates of cells expressing the PRAS40 cDNA showed a phosphorylated 40-kDa band by blotting with the anti-pAkt substrate antibody, the levels of which were greatly increased in comparison with cells transfected with plasmid alone (Fig. 5). The phosphorylation of this band was further increased when the cells were also transfected with a constitutively active version of Akt (called myr-Akt) (22Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) (Fig.5). Wortmannin, but not rapamycin, almost completely inhibited the phosphorylation of the expressed PRAS40 (Fig. 5), as was previously observed for the endogenous protein. Wortmannin did not block the phosphorylation of the expressed PRAS40 when the constitutively active Akt was also co-expressed. These results are consistent with PRAS40 being a direct substrate of Akt. To determine whether the predicted Akt consensus phosphorylation site (Thr-246) was in fact the site recognized by the anti-pAkt substrate antibody, a mutant form of the HA-tagged PRAS40 (T246A) was expressed in which this site was changed to Ala. The anti-pAkt substrate did not recognize the mutant PRAS40, even when the constitutively active Akt was co-expressed with this protein (Fig. 5). Expression of the mutant PRAS40 was verified by the presence of an HA-reactive band in these transfected cells. These results indicate that Thr-246 is the sole phosphorylation site in PRAS40 that is recognized by this antibody. Northern blot analyses of a number of tissues demonstrated the presence of two PRAS40 mRNA species, one at 2.6 and the other at 1.8 kilobases (Fig.6). An examination of the EST data base indicated the presence of two alternatively spliced forms of the human mRNA that were of sizes consistent with the two mRNA species observed (gi:16359151 and gi:14150198); however, both ESTs contained the same predicted coding region. Of the tissues tested, the highest levels of both mRNAs were observed in liver and heart. However, a PRAS40 band was readily detected in all the tissues tested. Western blot analyses of various rat tissues confirmed the presence of PRAS40 in all of the tissues examined (data not shown). To determine whether the expressed PRAS40 could bind 14-3-3, transiently expressed protein was immunoprecipitated from 293 cells via the use of antibodies to the added epitope tag. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting for 14-3-3. Insulin was found to stimulate the amount of 14-3-3 present in the precipitates (Fig. 7 a). To determine whether the endogenous PRAS40 was also capable of directly binding 14-3-3, we used the prostate cancer cell line called PC-3 that lacks the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate lipid phosphatase PTEN and thus has constitutively active Akt (23Nakatani K. Thompson D.A. Barthel A. Sakaue H. Liu W. Weigel R.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21528-21532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Precipitates of PRAS40 from these cells could directly bind 14-3-3 in a far Western (Fig. 7 b). To determine whether this was also regulated by PRAS40 phosphorylation, we treated these cells overnight with a reversible PI 3-kinase (LY294002) (24Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then either lysed the cells or washed out the inhibitor and incubated the cells for an additional 2 h. As seen in the anti-pAkt blot of these lysates, the overnight incubation with LY294002 resulted in a more than 95% decrease in phosphorylated Akt that was almost completely reversed after a subsequent 2-h incubation without inhibitor (Fig. 7 b). The 14-3-3 did not bind to PRAS40 from cells treated with LY294002 but did bind PRAS40 after removal of the inhibitor and the 2 h incubation (Fig. 7 b). This correlated with the phosphorylation of the PRAS40 (Fig. 7 b). These results indicate that 14-3-3 can bind directly to PRAS40 and that this binding is regulated by PRAS40 phosphorylation. Because insulin as well as LY294002 washout will activate various Ser/Thr kinases downstream of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate in addition to Akt (1Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4542) Google Scholar, 2Lizcano J.M. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 236-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), we sought a method to test whether activation of Akt alone was sufficient to stimulate phosphorylation of PRAS40. To this end, we expressed PRAS40 in mammalian cells that contain a conditionally active Akt. This expressed variant Akt can be activated by treatment of the cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen, a treatment that should not activate any other downstream targets of PI 3-kinase (19Kohn A.D. Barthel A. Kovacina K.S. Boge A. Wallach B. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Scott P.H. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11937-11943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Treatment of these cells with 4-hydroxytamoxifen stimulated the phosphorylation of wt PRAS40 but not the mutant PRAS40 in which Thr-246 was mutated (Fig.8). These results demonstrate that activation of Akt alone is sufficient to induce phosphorylation of PRAS40. To determine whether endogenous Akt is responsible for the phosphorylation of PRAS40 in nontransfected cells, we have used MEFs from mice lacking either Akt1 or Akt2, or both Akt1 and Akt2 (3Cho H. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Feng F. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38349-38352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 4Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q.

Phosphorylation of endogenous PRAS40 was greatly stimulated by PDGF in the MEFs from the wt mice and those lacking Akt2 (Fig.9 a). MEFs lacking Akt1 showed some decrease in the PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of PRAS40 (approximately a 30% decrease), whereas those lacking both Akt1 and Akt2 showed the largest decrease (70%) in PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation (Fig. 9 a). These values were consistent with the decreases observed in the PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK-3 (Fig. 9 b), another substrate of Akt (25Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar), as well as the amount of PDGF-stimulated phosphorylated Akt present in the four cell lines (Fig. 9 b). These results implicate endogenous Akt in the PDGF-stimulated phosphorylation of PRAS40. The present studies have identified a new substrate of Akt. Demonstration that PRAS40 is a substrate of Akt was accomplished by showing that it could be phosphorylated in vitro by Akt at the same site where it is phosphorylated in vivo after activation by insulin. Moreover, we showed that activation of an inducible Akt was alone sufficient to stimulate its phosphorylation. Finally, we showed that cells lacking Akt1 and Akt2 exhibit a diminished ability to phosphorylate this protein. This protein appears to be the major 14-3-3 binding protein which is responsive to insulin. It is also quite similar in size to a recently reported 14-3-3 binding protein (whose sequence is unknown) that is responsive to growth factors and nutrients in PC-12 cells (26Harthill J.E. Pozuelo R.M. Milne F.C. MacKintosh C. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although the function of this protein is not known, the presence of several proline-rich regions may allow it to interact with various SH3 or WW domain-containing proteins, thereby modifying the function of these molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2079311820,"The vast majority of G protein-coupled receptors are desensitized by a uniform two-step mechanism: phosphorylation of an active receptor followed by arrestin binding. The arrestin·receptor complex is then internalized. Internalized receptor can be recycled back to the plasma membrane (resensitization) or targeted to lysosomes for degradation (down-regulation). The intracellular compartment where this choice is made and the molecular mechanisms involved are largely unknown. Here we used two arrestin2 mutants that bind with high affinity to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated agonist-activated β2-adrenergic receptor to manipulate the receptor-arrestin interface. We found that mutants support rapid internalization of β2-adrenergic receptor similar to wild type arrestin2. At the same time, phosphorylation-independent arrestin2 mutants facilitate receptor recycling and sharply reduce the rate of receptor loss, effectively protecting β2-adrenergic receptor from down-regulation even after very long (up to 24 h) agonist exposure. Phosphorylation-independent arrestin2 mutants dramatically reduce receptor phosphorylation in response to an agonist both in vitro and in cells. Interestingly, co-expression of high levels of β-adrenergic receptor kinase restores receptor down-regulation in the presence of mutants to the levels observed with wild type arrestin2. Our data suggest that unphosphorylated receptor internalized in complex with mutant arrestins recycles faster than phosphoreceptor and is less likely to get degraded. Thus, targeted manipulation of the characteristics of an arrestin protein that binds to a G protein-coupled receptors can dramatically change receptor trafficking and its ultimate fate in a cell.

G protein-coupled receptors GPCR-kinase wild type β2-adrenergic receptor human embryonic kidney Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium green fluorescence protein hemagglutinin phosphate-buffered saline PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 phosphorylated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 are the largest known group of sensor proteins. There are over 1,000 members of this family that respond to a wide variety of stimuli: light, odorants, hormones, neurotransmitters, peptides, extracellular calcium, etc. (1Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Progr. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Google Scholar). Activated GPCRs catalyze GDP/GTP exchange on heterotrimeric G proteins, whereupon the GTP-liganded G protein α-subunit and the free βγ-dimer modulate the activity of various effectors, including adenylyl cyclase, phospholipase C, cGMP phosphodiesterase, ion channels, etc. (1Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Progr. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Google Scholar). The same active receptor conformation that interacts with G proteins is phosphorylated by GPCR-kinases (GRKs) (1Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Progr. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Google Scholar). Arrestins then bind to the active phosphorylated state of the receptor (2Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Google Scholar). Arrestin binding prevents further G protein interaction (apparently, by simple steric exclusion (3Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18125-18131Google Scholar)), often targeting receptors to the coated pits due to the high affinity of non-visual arrestins for various components of the internalization machinery: clathrin (4Goodman O.B.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10677-10680Google Scholar). Arrestins also couple GPCRs to alternative, G protein-independent signaling pathways (1Claing A. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Progr. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Google Scholar), such as activation of Src (7Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K.

Lefkowitz R.J. Progr. Neurobiol. 2002; 66: 61-79Google Scholar). The loss of active receptor conformation promotes arrestin dissociation, whereupon the receptor can be dephopshorylated and recycled to the plasma membrane. The release of receptor-bound arrestin, kinetically limited by the stability of the arrestin·receptor complex, is the first step in this process. Both non-visual arrestins preferentially bind to the phosphorylated agonist-activated form of their cognate GPCRs (10Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28849-28852Google Scholar, 11Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Google Scholar, 12Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9043-9048Google Scholar). However, their binding to the phosphorylated inactive form is also relatively high (11Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Google Scholar, 12Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9043-9048Google Scholar), suggesting that arrestin dissociation from internalized phosphoreceptor may be rate-limiting. Recently we have constructed several structurally diverse mutants of both non-visual arrestins that bind to activated receptors in a phosphorylation-independent fashion (10Gurevich V.V. Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. Onorato J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28849-28852Google Scholar, 11Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol.

In contrast to wild type (WT) arrestin2 binding to phosphoreceptor, the binding of the arrestin2(R169E) and arrestin2(3A) phosphorylation-independent mutants to unphosphorylated receptor is strictly activation-dependent. We expected that in cells these mutants would bind primarily to the unphosphorylated receptor and that upon internalization the mutant arrestin·receptor complex would dissociate substantially faster than the complex of WT arrestin2 with phosphoreceptor. Here we used phosphorylation-independent mutants to examine how this change in the properties of the arrestin·receptor complex affects receptor trafficking in cells. Note that in this paper we use the systematic names of arrestin proteins. The synonyms of arrestin2 are β-arrestin and β-arrestin1; arrestin3 is also called β-arrestin2. Direct arrestin-binding assay was performed with purified reconstituted β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and in vitro-translated radiolabeled arrestins, as described (12Gurevich V.V. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Ptasienski J. Kim C.M. Sterne-Marr R. Hosey M.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Google Scholar). Briefly, the receptor was phosphorylated with GRK2 in the presence of 50 μm of isoproterenol and washed to remove the agonist.In vitro-translated tritiated arrestins (50 fmol) were mixed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm potassium acetate with phosphorylated or unphosphorylated β2AR (100 fmol/assay) in the presence of 50 μm β-agonist isoproterenol or 50 μm β-antagonist alprenolol in a final volume of 50 μl. The samples were then incubated for 35 min at 30 °C, immediately cooled on ice, and loaded onto 2-ml Sepharose 2B columns equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl. The bound arrestin eluted with the receptor-containing membranes in the void volume (between 0.5 and 1.1 ml). Nonspecific binding determined in the presence of 0.3 μg liposomes (<10% of the total binding and <1% of the arrestin present in the assay) was subtracted. In vitro receptor phosphorylation assay was performed by incubating 450 fmol of purified reconstituted β2AR with 400 fmol of purified GRK2 in the presence of 50 μm of isoproterenol in 10 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 μm cold ATP + [γ-32P]ATP (final specific activity 10–15 dpm/fmol) with or without the indicated concentrations of Escherichia coli-expressed purified WT arrestin2 or R169E mutant (10Gurevich V.V.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Google Scholar) for 10 min at 30 °C. After both arrestin and GRK2 were added to the receptor, the reactions were started by the addition of ATP and stopped by the addition of 5 μl of SDS sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, the gels were dried, exposed, β2AR bands were cut out, and the incorporated radioactivity was quantified in a liquid scintillation counter. HEK-tsA201 cells, a clone of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing the simian virus 40 large T antigen, were used. The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. At 60–70% confluence in T75 flasks, the cells were co-transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA3-β2AR-GFP (14Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Google Scholar) and 6–10 μg of pcDNA3-arrestin2 or its R169E or 3A mutants. In the experiments shown in Figs. 6 and 7, the cells were also co-transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3-GRK2 (14Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Google Scholar). For the experiments shown in Fig. 4, the cells were transfected with 5 μg of the indicated arrestin2 construct along with 2 μg of pcDNA3-β2AR-GFP plus 2 μg of hemagglutinin (HA)-β2AR (7Luttrell L.M.

The cells were then divided and treated in suspension in PBS supplemented with 1 mm ascorbic acid (for 1 and 2 h incubation) with or without 10 μm (−)isoproterenol (Sigma). At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS. For 24-h incubation the cells were treated in six well plates and harvested after the wash. Total and cell surface receptor was measured with 0.2 nm [125I]pindolol (1 h; 22 °C) and 15 nm [3H]CGP-12177 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (3 h; 14 °C), respectively, as described (14Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm(−)alprenolol (Sigma) and subtracted. Internalized receptor was calculated as the difference between total and cell-surface receptor. Cells expressing 1–2.5 pmol β2AR per 1 mg of total protein were used. The expression of arrestins and GRK2 in each experiment was measured by quantitative Western blotting (with corresponding purified proteins as standards), as described (11Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-arrestin F4C1 (15Donoso L.A. Gregerson D.S. Smith L. Robertson S. Knospe V. Vrabec T. Kalsow C.M. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 343-355Google Scholar) and anti-GRK 2/3 (Upstate Biotechnology) were used as the primary antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used as the secondary antibody. The bands were visualized with Super Signal ECL reagent (Pierce) and quantified, as described (11Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Google Scholar,16Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Benovic J.L. Gurevich V.V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7058-7063Google Scholar). This was performed on an Olympus Axiovert dual laser fluorescent confocal microscope. The cells were grown, treated, and subsequently fixed (3.7% paraformaldehyde; 20 min on ice) and permeabilized (0.1–0.05% Triton X-100; 3 min) on Lab-Tek chambered cover glass (Nunc). Arrestins were visualized with F4C1 (15Donoso L.A. Gregerson D.S. Smith L. Robertson S. Knospe V. Vrabec T. Kalsow C.M. Curr. Eye Res. 1990; 9: 343-355Google Scholar) followed by rhodamine-conjugated (red) goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes); HA-β2AR was labeled with monoclonal anti-HA rhodamine-conjugated antibody (Boehriger Mannheim), the signal was amplified with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody; β2AR-GFP (green) was detected by its intrinsic fluorescence. To make confocal microscopy data as reliable and quantitative as the data obtained by direct measurements of arrestin and ligand binding, for each time point in every experiment we collected 25–70 images, quantified relevant signals, and statistically analyzed the results. Images collected on the confocal microscope were analyzed using C-Imaging systems software Simple 32 (Compix Inc, Cranberry Township, PA). To analyze intracellular antibody deposition in the presence of WT arrestin2 or R169E mutant (Fig. 4), two-color confocal images of green β2AR-GFP and red HA-β2AR labeled with anti-HA rhodamine-conjugated antibody were collected and saved as two-color and red single-color images. The membranes of the cells were carefully outlined using two-color images (green β2AR-GFP and red HA-β2AR) to improve the visibility of the membrane, particularly after longer incubations. Using red single-color images converted to grayscale, the area of red fluorescence corresponding to the receptor was thresholded based on the grayscale, and the total amount of red fluorescence (anti-HA rhodamine-conjugated antibody) and intracellular red fluorescence were measured for each cell. To measure only intracellular receptor, we excluded the receptor associated with the cell membrane by disqualifying any fluorescent object that touched the membrane outline. The results were expressed for each cell as a percentage of the total cell-associated red fluorescence localized inside the cell. The data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance with protein (WTversus R169E) and incubation time as main factors. To determine the dependence of intracellular antibody accumulation on incubation time, separate analysis of variance for each arrestin protein with incubation time as the main factor was used. Post hoc comparison and contrasts to compare individual time points were used where appropriate. For all statistical analyses, p < 0.05 was considered significant. Assays using reversible surface receptor biotinylation (Fig. 5) were performed essentially as described (17Lin J.W. Ju W. Foster K. Lee S.H. Ahmadian G. Wyszynski M. Wang Y.T. Sheng M. Nature Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1282-1290Google Scholar, 18Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK-tsA201 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding β2AR-GFP with and without plasmids encoding WT arrestin2 and R169E mutant. 24 h post-transfection the cells were re-plated in poly-d-lysine-covered 24-well plates and serum-starved overnight. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (PCM), biotinylated on ice with 6–10 mg/ml of Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in PCM for 40–50 min. The cells were washed 3 times with PCM with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in DMEM supplemented with 1 mm ascorbic acid in the presence or absence of 10 μm isoproterenol with or without 20 mmNH4Cl (to inhibit recycling) (25Hsieh C. Brown S. Derleth C. Mackie K. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 493-501Google Scholar). At the end of the incubation, plates were cooled on ice and washed three times with ice-cold PCM. To quantify internalized receptor, surface biotin was removed by two 15-min cycles of reduction with ice-cold 150 mm glutathione, pH 8.75, in 150 mm NaCl, followed by neutralization for 20 min with 50 mmiodoacetamide in PCM. To determine the rate of receptor recycling, the plates after agonist incubation and wash were further incubated in DMEM with 10 μm antagonist alprenolol for 10 and 20 min at 37 °C and then reduced and neutralized. The cells in each well were lysed at room temperature in 0.1 ml of extraction buffer (EB) (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm lysine, 2 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 1% SDS. The lysates were transferred to an Eppendorf tube, diluted with 0.5 ml of EB with 1% Triton X-100, and sonicated for 10 s on ice. Cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 4 °C. The upper 0.5 ml were transferred to an Eppendorf tube containing 15 μl of UltraLink immobilized avidin gel (Pierce) and incubated overnight with gentle rolling at 4 °C (the remainder was used to quantify arrestin expression by Western). To remove unbound protein, the gel was washed twice with EB with 1% Triton X-100 and twice with EB. The gel was then resuspended in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and quantitative Western blotting using primary anti-GFP Living Colors A.v. peptide antibody (Clontech) (1:1,000) and secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) (1:12,500). The bands were visualized with Super Signal ECL reagent (Pierce) and quantified, as described (11Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Google Scholar, 16Gray-Keller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Benovic J.L. Gurevich V.V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7058-7063Google Scholar), on Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad) using Quantity One 4.2.0 software. For each experiment, three wells were not biotinylated (negative control), three were left unreduced after biotinylation (total biotinylated receptor, control for the efficiency of biotinylation), and three wells were reduced immediately after biotinylation (control for the efficiency of biotin removal). The amount of biotinylated β2AR-GFP in these samples was quantified as above. The total biotinylated receptor in each experiment was used as a reference point (100%) for the quantification of internalized receptor. Only the data from the experiments where the amount of biotinylated β2AR-GFP was high and the removal of the biotin was complete were used. In all experiments three wells per experimental condition were used. This was performed essentially as described (47Price R.R. Morris D.P. Biswas G. Smith M.P. Schwinn D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9570-9579Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were transfected with HA-β2AR to achieve receptor expression of 3–5 pmol/mg protein and either control pcDNA3 vector or constructs expressing WT arrestin2, arrestin2(R169E), or arrestin2(3A) mutants (>25 fmol/μg of total protein, i.e. ≫25-fold endogenous arrestin2). Transfected cells were re-plated into 12-well plates, serum-starved overnight, washed 3× with 2 ml of phosphate-free DMEM (PF-DMEM), incubated in PF-DMEM for 7 min, and washed with the same medium 3× with 2 ml per well. For receptor and arrestin quantification by [125]IPIN binding and Western, the cells were scraped into 50 mm Tris-Hcl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and homogenized by pipetting. For [32P] labeling, the cells were incubated for 2 h in 1 ml of PF-DMEM supplemented with 0.25 mm ascorbic acid, 170 μCi of [32P]phosphoric acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with or without 2.5 μm isoproterenol, as well as with 2.5 μm isoproterenol plus 20 mmNH4Cl (to inhibit receptor recycling) at 37 °C. Following incubation, the cells were chilled on ice, washed with ice-cold PBS, and solubilized in 0.5 ml per well of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, 3 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were centrifuged for 20 min at 100,000 rpm (rotor TLA100, Beckman TL-100 tabletop ultracentrifuge). To reduce background, supernatants were pre-cleared by incubation with 10 μl of protein G-agarose (Boehringer-Mannheim) for 3 h at 4 °C. After the removal of precipitated material, the supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube and incubated for 1 h with 1 μg of 3F10 high-affinity rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Boehringer-Mannheim) at 4 °C. After the addition of 10 μl of protein G-agarose beads, incubation was continued overnight (14–15 h) at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice for 20 min at 4 °C with 1 ml of lysis buffer, twice with high salt buffer (lysis buffer containing 0.1% Igepal, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate, and 500 mm NaCl), and twice with the same buffer without NaCl. Immune complexes were then resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer and separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gel. After autoradiography, 32P incorporation into receptor band was quantified on Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad) using Quantity One 4.2.0 software. The identity of the radiolabeled band with HA-β2AR was further confirmed by Western blotting of immunoprecipitated material with HA-Tag mouse monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling). A major conformational rearrangement of the arrestin molecule is necessary for high-affinity receptor binding (2Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

To delineate the minimal phosphoacceptor sites required for IRF-3 activation, several point mutations were generated and tested for transactivation potential and cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300 coactivator association. Expression of the IRF-3 S396D mutant alone was sufficient to induce type I IFN β, IFNα1, RANTES, and the interferon-stimulated gene 561 promoters. Using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a novel phosphospecific antibody, we show for the first time that, in vivo, IRF-3 is phosphorylated on Ser396 following Sendai virus infection, expression of viral nucleocapsid, and double-stranded RNA treatment. These results demonstrate that Ser396 within the C-terminal Ser/Thr cluster is targeted in vivo for phosphorylation following virus infection and plays an essential role in IRF-3 activation. The inability of the phosphospecific antibody to detect Ser396phosphorylation in lipopolysaccharide-treated cells suggests that other major pathways may be involved in IRF-3 activation following Toll-like receptor 4 stimulation.

Recognition of invading pathogens such as viruses and bacteria by host cells is known to trigger the activation of multiple latent transcription factors, such as NF-κB, AP-1 (ATF-2/c-Jun), and the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) 1The abbreviations used are: IRF, interferon regulatory factor; IFN, interferon; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; ISRE, interferon-stimulated response element(s); ds, double-stranded; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein; PRD, positive regulatory domain(s); RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; ISG, IFN-stimulated gene; N, nucleocapsid; SeV, Sendai virus; HEK, human embryonic kidney; TLR, Toll-like receptor; WCE, whole cell extracts; HAU, hemagglutination units 1The abbreviations used are: IRF, interferon regulatory factor; IFN, interferon; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; ISRE, interferon-stimulated response element(s); ds, double-stranded; CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein; PRD, positive regulatory domain(s); RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; ISG, IFN-stimulated gene; N, nucleocapsid; SeV, Sendai virus; HEK, human embryonic kidney; TLR, Toll-like receptor; WCE, whole cell extracts; HAU, hemagglutination units (1Akira S.

Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 985-992Google Scholar). Once activated, these transcription factors regulate the expression of a set of genes encoding for immunomodulatory cytokines and chemokines that are involved in the establishment of the antiviral/bacterial state, which limits the spread of infection through innate and adaptive immune mechanisms (1Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Google Scholar, 2Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Google Scholar, 3Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. Hiscott J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 985-992Google Scholar). The best characterized component of the innate host defense to virus is the family of transcriptionally activated interferon (IFN) proteins, which include type I IFN-α and IFN-β and type II IFN-γ. Type I IFNs are mainly induced in response to infection by various types of RNA and DNA viruses (2Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Google Scholar, 4Sen G.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Google Scholar), although the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces production of IFN in certain cells, albeit at low levels (5Sing A. Merlin T. Knopf H.-P.

Once produced, these secreted proteins act in a paracrine fashion to induce gene expression in target cells in the adjacent microenvironment through engagement of cell surface IFN receptors and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The ISGF3 complex (ISGF3γ/IRF-9-STAT1-STAT2) binds to interferon-stimulated response elements (ISRE) found in numerous IFN-induced genes, such as 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthase and the double-stranded (ds) RNA-activated kinase, resulting in the induction of proteins that impair viral gene expression and replication (2Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Google Scholar, 4Sen G.C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Google Scholar). IRF-3 is part of the IRF family of transcription factors that includes nine members with distinct roles in host defense against pathogens, immunomodulation, and growth control (for review see Refs. 3Servant M.J.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the C-terminal region of IRF-3, which comprises a cluster of phosphoacceptor sites,382GGASSLENTVDLHISNSHPLSLTSDQY408, is phosphorylated as a consequence of virus infection (9Yoneyama M.

Radioactive orthophosphate labeling, peptide mapping, phosphoamino acid analysis, and decreased mobility in SDS-PAGE have shown that IRF-3 is a phosphoprotein that is further inducibly phosphorylated upon virus infection (10Lin R.

The generation of point mutated forms of IRF-3 suggests that Ser385 and Ser386 (9Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukada M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Google Scholar), as well as Ser396, Ser398, Ser402, Ser405, and Thr404 (10Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Google Scholar) are phosphorylated following virus infection and are involved in IRF-3 activation. Indeed, C-terminal phosphorylation is thought to produce a change in protein conformation that reveals the IRF association domain and the DNA-binding domain, thus promoting dimerization and binding to IRF-3 5′-GAAA(C/G)(C/G)GAAN(T/C)-3′ consensus DNA-binding site (9Yoneyama M.

In addition, IRF-3 C-terminal phosphorylation is required for association with the histone acetyltransferase nuclear proteins CBP and p300 (9Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukada M. Nishida E.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Google Scholar) causing IRF-3, which normally shuttles into and out of the nucleus, to become predominantly nuclear (9Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukada M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Google Scholar, 10Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Google Scholar, 17Kumar K.P. McBride K.M. Weaver B.K. Dingwall C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4159-4168Google Scholar). The activated form of IRF-3, bound to CBP, induces transcription through distinct positive regulatory domains (PRD) in the type I IFN promoters and through select ISRE sites found in other genes such as the chemokine RANTES, the cytokine interleukin-15, and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) 56 (10–12, 15, 18–22). Finally, phosphorylation of IRF-3 is thought to induce its degradation by a proteasome-mediated mechanism (10Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Google Scholar, 23Ronco L.V. Karpova A.Y. Vidal M. Howley P.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2061-2072Google Scholar). In addition to virus infection, other stimuli such as LPS and poly(I-C) have been shown to induce IRF-3 activation (9Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukada M. Nishida E. Fujita T.

Yoneyama M. Yamaguchi K. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Amano F. Fujita T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 251-256Google Scholar). However, no phosphorylation of IRF-3 in response to poly(I-C) treatment has been demonstrated. In this case, IRF-3 activation has been observed through nuclear accumulation, DNA binding activity, coactivator association, and gene induction (9Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukada M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Google Scholar, 12Weaver B.K. Kumar K.P. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1359-1368Google Scholar, 15Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V.

The in vivo signaling pathways leading to IRF-3 phosphorylation and activation as well as the precise phosphoacceptor sites remain to be elucidated. Previous studies have demonstrated inducible N-terminal phosphorylation of IRF-3 following the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase pathways (13Servant M.J. ten Oever B. LePage C. Conti L. Gessani S. Julkunen I. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 355-363Google Scholar). More recently, the activation of DNA-PK following virus infection was shown to induce Thr135 phosphorylation (29Karpova A.Y. Trost M. Murray J.M. Cantley L.C. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2818-2823Google Scholar). However, no convincing physiological roles have been ascribed to these covalent modifications. In the present study, we characterized the minimal phosphoacceptor site(s) involved in the in vivo activation of IRF-3 following treatment with known inducers. Of the seven potential phosphoacceptor sites present in the C-terminal cluster, a single point mutation of Ser396 to Asp (S396D) was sufficient to generate a strong constitutively active form of IRF-3. Moreover, by using a novel phosphospecific antibody, we show for the first time that Ser396 is phosphorylated in vivofollowing virus infection, nucleocapsid (N) expression or dsRNA treatment. LPS (L-2654) was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in distilled water. Poly(I-C) was purchased from AmershamBiosciences and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Sendai virus (SeV) was a generous gift of Dr. Ilkka Julkunen (Public Health Research Institute, Helsinki, Finland). wtIRF-3, wtIRF-3 5A, wtIRF-3 5D, wtIRF-3 3D, wtIRF-3 J2A, and wtIRF-3 J2D pFLAG constructs and the luciferase reporter plasmids IFNα promoter (IFNA1 pGL-3), IFNβ promoter (IFNB pGL-3), and the RANTES promoter (RANTES pGL-3) were described previously (13Servant M.J. ten Oever B.

The expression constructs encoding different IRF-3 C-terminal point mutants pFLAG-IRF-3 3A, 2D, 2A, S396A, S396D, S398A, S398D, S398A/S402A, and S398D/S402D were generated by overlap PCR mutagenesis using Vent DNA polymerase. The pCMV-2 measles N expression construct has been described previously (30tenOever B.R. Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3659-3669Google Scholar). SeV N cDNA was subcloned from pGEM SeV N plasmid (a gift from Dr. Illka Julkunen) using 5′-AATGGCTGGGTTGTTGAGCACCTTC-3′ and 5′-TTAGATTCCTCCCATCCCAGCTGCT-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The PCR-generated fragment was subcloned into pCMV-2. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown in α-minimum essential medium. HEC-1B cells and the astrocytoma cell line U373 overexpressing the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 coreceptor CD14 (U373/CD14), a gift from Dr. Michael David (University of California, San Diego, CA), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. U937 cells were grown in RPMI supplemented with 5% fetal clone (Hyclone) and antibiotics. All of the transfections were carried out on subconfluent HEK 293 cells (calcium phosphate coprecipitation method) or HEC-1B cells (FuGENE method) grown in 60-mm Petri dishes or 24-well plates (for the luciferase assay). 5 μg of DNA constructs (per 60-mm dish) or 10 ng of pRLTK reporter (Renilla luciferase for internal control), 100 ng of pGL3 reporter (firefly luciferase, experimental reporter), and 250 ng of pFLAG expression plasmids (24-well plate) were introduced into HEK 293 cells. At 36 h, the cells were collected, washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and assayed for reporter gene activities (Promega). Infections with SeV as well as treatments with poly(I-C) and LPS were accomplished in serum-free medium for the first 2 h, after which 10% fetal bovine serum was added for the rest of the incubation period. Whole cell extracts (WCE) were prepared in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 30 mm NaF, 1.0 mm Na3VO4, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml of each leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin) and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was harvested using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript (Invitrogen), and the resulting cDNA were used in a PCR with the primers described for the original cloning of virus N cDNAs (see above) at an annealing temperature of 60 °C using Taq DNA polymerase (AmershamBiosciences). To generate the polyclonal antibody specific for IRF-3 phosphorylated at Ser396, termed HIS5033, a phosphopeptide corresponding to residues 388–402 of human IRF-3, KENTVDLHIS(PO 4−)NSHPLS, was synthetized (W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Center), coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used to immunize rabbits (Pocono Rabbit Farms & Laboratory, Inc, Canadensis, PA). Briefly, 2 mg of peptide in phosphate-buffered saline was coupled to 5 mg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma) in 0.2% glutaraldehyde. After neutralization with glycine, the coupled peptide was dialyzed overnight against cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended at a concentration of 2 mg/ml for immunization. To analyze the state of IRF-3 phosphorylation and to confirm the expression of the transgenes, WCE (30–60 μg) were subjected to electrophoresis on 7.5% or 10% acrylamide gels. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose membranes (Nycomed Amersham, Inc.) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at 25 °C before incubation for 2 h at 25 °C with anti-IRF-3 (Santa Cruz; SC-9082), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-IκBα (MAD 10) (1 μg/ml), anti-MYC (9E10) (1 μg/ml), or anti-ISG56 (a gift from Dr. G. Sen (Cleveland, OH) (1:1000) in blocking solution. For the phosphospecific antibodies anti-IκBα Ser32 phosphospecific antibody (1:2000) (New England Biolab) and HIS5033 (1:10000), the membranes were incubated in blocking solution for 1 h at 25 °C followed by incubation in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 for overnight at 4 °C. After washing four times in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (1:10000) in blocking solution. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For coimmunoprecipitation studies, WCE (500 μg) were incubated with 1 μg of anti-CBP antibody A-22 (Santa Cruz) or 1 μg of anti-FLAG antibody M2 linked to 30 μl of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads, respectively, for 3 h at 4 °C (AmershamBiosciences). The beads were washed five times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and resuspended in denaturating sample buffer, and the eluted IRF-3 proteins associated with CBP were analyzed by immunoblotting. To delineate the minimal residues required for IRF-3 activation, the effects of various phosphomimetic point mutations (Fig.1 A) on the transactivating potential of IRF-3 were analyzed using reporter gene assays with the IRF-3-responsive promoters IFNα1, IFNβ, and RANTES (Fig.1 B). Overexpression of wtIRF-3 alone minimally induced IFNα1, IFNβ, and RANTES promoter activities, as demonstrated previously (10Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Google Scholar, 21Lin R. Genin P. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6342-6353Google Scholar, 31Juang Y.T. Lowther W. Kellum M. Au W.C. Lin R. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9837-9842Google Scholar), whereas introduction of the C-terminal point mutation, S396D, enhanced IRF-3 transactivating potential over wtIRF-3 by 13-, 14-, and 11-fold for the IFNα1, IFNβ, and RANTES promoters, respectively (Fig. 1 B). The IFNα1, IFNβ, and RANTES promoters were also activated by the double point mutant 2D (13-, 12-, and 12-fold over wtIRF-3, respectively) and, as previously reported (10Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Google Scholar, 16Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Google Scholar, 18Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Pitha P.M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6342-6353Google Scholar), the multiple point mutant 5D (9-, 5.5-, and 8-fold induction, respectively). However, the point mutants S398D, S398D/S402D, and S402D/S404D/S405D exhibited only intermediate effects, and the S385D/S386D mutant did not induce these promoters. Our initial result thus demonstrates that substitution of Ser396 with the phosphomimetic Asp is sufficient to generate a constitutively active form of IRF-3 that functions as a strong activator of promoters containing PRD I–III or ISRE regulatory elements. Formation of the IRF-3 holocomplex, which consists of an IRF-3 dimer and CBP or p300 coactivators, is a critical step in the activation of the transcription factor (32Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Kitabayashi I. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22304-22313Google Scholar). Association with CBP/p300 is strictly localized to the nucleus and tethers IRF-3 in the nucleus after induction with viruses (16Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Google Scholar, 17Kumar K.P. McBride K.M. Weaver B.K. Dingwall C. Reich N.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4159-4168Google Scholar, 32Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Kitabayashi I. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22304-22313Google Scholar). Therefore, the relationship between the different IRF-3 point mutants and CBP association was evaluated using coimmunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig.2, infection with SeV stimulated wtIRF-3 and CBP association (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 1 and 2). Mutation of Ser396 to Ala completely abrogated virus-induced CBP association (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3 and 4), whereas the phosphomimetic point mutant S396D constitutively associated with CBP (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 3), an association that was enhanced following virus infection (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). Similar results were obtained with the other mutants IRF-3 2A (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 8) and IRF-3 5A (Fig. 2 A, lanes 13 and 14), where no inducible association with CBP was observed. Conversely, strong constitutive binding to CBP was present with IRF-3 2D (Fig.2 B, lane 7) and IRF-3 5D (Fig. 2 B,lane 13). As a control for these results, the S398A form of IRF-3 was still able to associate with CBP following virus infection (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6), but only a basal association of the phosphomimetic counterpart IRF-3 S398D with CBP was observed in the absence of infection (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 5). As previously reported (16Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Google Scholar), coactivator association was not observed with either the IRF-3 J2A or J2D mutants (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 15 and 16). As discussed previously (30tenOever B.R. Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3659-3669Google Scholar), Ser385/386 phosphorylation may be required for the sequential phosphorylation of the Ser/Thr cluster at amino acids 396–405. Together these data indicate that Ser396 is a critical phosphoacceptor site for coactivator CBP/p300 association and that a clear correlation exists between the capacity of the point mutants to induce promoter activity and to associate with the CBP coactivator. Recent studies have demonstrated that the561 gene encoding the ISG56 protein is strongly induced in response to virus infection, type I IFN, dsRNA (33Guo J. Peters K.L. Sen G.C. Virology. 2000; 267: 209-219Google Scholar) or direct expression of IRF-3 5D (20Grandvaux N. Servant M.J. tenOever B.R. Sen G.C. Balachandran S. Barber G.N. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5532-5539Google Scholar). The effect of IRF-3 on 561 gene induction is direct, because the promoter contains two tandem ISRE sites, mutation of which results in the complete loss of promoter activation by IRF-3 5D (20Grandvaux N. Servant M.J. tenOever B.R. Sen G.C. Balachandran S. Barber G.N. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5532-5539Google Scholar). To determine the effect of transient expression of the different phosphomimetic IRF-3 forms on the induction of the endogenous ISG56 in the IFN-unresponsive HEC-1B cells, induction of ISG56 was analyzed by immunoblot (Fig.3). Sendai virus infection resulted in 25-fold induction of ISG56 (Fig. 3, lane 10), whereas wtIRF-3 expression alone resulted in a weak induction of ISG56 protein of 2.6-fold (Fig. 3, lane 2). Transfection of S396D as well as 2D and 5D resulted in a stronger induction of the protein of 5.2-, 6.4-, and 10-fold, respectively (Fig. 3, lanes 3,5, and 8). However, only weak inductions between 2.2- and 3.5-fold were observed with the other point mutants (Fig. 3,lanes 4, 6, 7, and 9). Thus, mutation at position 396 is sufficient to create a phosphomimetic form of IRF-3 that allows stable binding to CBP/p300 coactivator, transactivation of reporter genes controlled by PRD and ISRE response elements, and, importantly, enhancement of endogenous expression of ISG56. To verify whether in vivophosphorylation of IRF-3 occurred at Ser396, an antibody directed against a phosphopeptide spanning Ser396, named HIS5033, was raised (see “Materials and Methods”). Fig.4 A shows that the antibody reacted only toward the transfected FLAG-wtIRF-3 transgene when cells were infected with SeV; indeed, no signal was observed in IRF-3 S396A-overexpressing cells infected with SeV. In contrast, Fig.4 B shows a specific endogenous signal when extracts derived from SeV-infected HEK 293 cells were analyzed by immunoblot using the phosphospecific 396-P antibody HIS5033 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3). Reblotting of the stripped membrane with an anti-IRF-3 antibody (SC-9082) showed that the specific signal observed with HIS5033 antibody corresponded to the slowly migrating form of IRF-3, previously shown to represent the activated form of IRF-3 (Fig.4 B, compare lanes 4–6) (10Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Google Scholar, 13Servant M.J. ten Oever B. LePage C. Conti L. Gessani S. Julkunen I. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 355-363Google Scholar). Although IRF-3 degradation had already reduced the amount of IRF-3 in these cells at 6 h post-infection (Fig. 4 B, lane 5) and the IRF-3 signal was difficult to detect with anti-IRF-3 antibody (SC-9082), the phosphospecific antibody HIS5033 reacted strongly under these conditions (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 2and 5 and lanes 3 and 6). To investigate whether the phosphorylation of Ser396 could be mimicked by expression of viral N protein (30tenOever B.R. Servant M.J. Grandvaux N. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3659-3669Google Scholar), transfection experiments were performed with constructs expressing measles virus and SeV N for 36 h post-transfection. As shown in Fig. 4 C, expression of either SeV or measles virus N induced higher migrating forms of IRF-3 (middle panel). Use of HIS5033 antibody revealed that Ser396 was phosphorylated under these conditions (Fig. 4 C, top panel). Taken together, these results demonstrate that virus infection or expression of viral nucleocapsid protein is sufficient to induce Ser396phosphorylation. To study the kinetics of Ser396phosphorylation in response to virus, dsRNA, or LPS, the LPS-sensitive human U373/CD14 astrocytoma cell line was used as previously described (34Orr S.L. Tobias P. J. Endotoxin Res. 2000; 6: 215-222Google Scholar). Detailed kinetics of SeV, LPS, and poly(I-C) induction was performed, and the phosphorylation state of Ser396 was analyzed by immunoblot using the phosphospecific antibody HIS5033. As shown in Fig. 5 (A andB), both SeV and poly(I-C) induced Ser396phosphorylation of IRF-3 with maximum signals detected at 4 and 2 h, respectively (Fig. 5, A, lanes 4–7, andB, lanes 3 and 4). Specific phosphoserine 396 signal was detected when IRF-3 first displayed a retarded mobility in SDS-PAGE, as observed by the use of the SC-9082 antibody (Fig. 5, A, lanes 12–15, andB, lanes 11–13). However, no signal was detected when cells were treated with LPS (Fig. 5 C, lanes 1–8). Furthermore, qualitative and temporal differences in the kinetics of IRF-3 Ser396 phosphorylation by SeV and poly(I-C) were identified: 1) Although phosphorylation of IRF-3 in response to SeV infection, first detected at 4 h post-infection, was followed by degradation (Fig. 5 A, lanes 12–16), phosphorylation in response to poly(I-C) was detected at 2 h and did not lead to degradation. Rather, IRF-3 appeared to be dephosphorylated over time and returned to basal forms (Fig.5 B, lanes 12–16). 2) Although Ser396phosphorylation was not detected after LPS stimulation, a transient shift from form I to form II (Fig. 5 C, lanes 13–15) was observed.

Despite considerable structural and biophysical research, the mechanism behind activation of the NMDA receptor is still poorly understood. By analyzing patch clamp recordings of one channel activated by glutamate, we determined the burst structure and open probability for recombinant rat NR1/NR2B receptors. We used partial agonists at the glutamate and glycine binding sites to show that at least two kinetically distinct subunit-associated conformational changes link co-agonist binding to the opening of the NMDA receptor pore. These data suggest that NR1 and NR2B subunits, respectively, undergo a fast and slow agonist-dependent conformational change that precedes opening of the pore. We propose a new working model of receptor activation that can account for macroscopic as well as microscopic NMDA receptor properties."

https://openalex.org/W1982177408,"The molecular chaperone Hsp90 is known to be involved in the activation of key regulatory proteins such as kinases, steroid hormone receptors, and transcription factors in an ATP-dependent manner. During the chaperone cycle, Hsp90 has been found associated with the partner protein Hop/Sti1, which seems to be required for the progression of the cycle. However, little is known about its specific function. Here we have investigated the interaction of Sti1 from <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> with Hsp90 and its influence on the ATPase activity. We show that the inhibitory mechanism of Sti1 on the ATPase activity of Hsp90 is non-competitive. Sti1 binds to the N- and C-terminal part of Hsp90 and prevents the N-terminal dimerization reaction that is required for efficient ATP hydrolysis. The first 24 amino acids of Hsp90, a region shown previously to be important for the association of the N-terminal domains and stimulation of ATP hydrolysis, seems to be important for this interaction."

Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18277-18284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The precise gating mechanism of IP3R triggered by IP3 remains unclear, but IP3 binding induces a substantial but as yet undefined conformational change, which may cause channel opening (10Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Besides this channel opening, such IP3-induced conformational change has been assumed to be responsible for degradation of IP3R (13Zhu C.-C. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3476-3484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Zhu C.-C. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration resulting from IP3R activation regulates the activities of thousands of downstream targets that play key roles in many aspects of cellular processes, including fertilization, development, proliferation, secretion, and synaptic plasticity (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6158) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

To control such a vast array of cell functions, Ca2+ signals need to be precisely regulated in terms of space, time and amplitude (2Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar, 15Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Lipp P. Nature. 1998; 395: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Such a complex regulation of Ca2+ signals has been partly attributed to the diversity of IP3R isoform expression, assembly of heterotetrameric complexes of IP3R isoforms, subcellular distributions of IP3R, and regulation of IP3R by Ca2+ itself, ATP, and phosphorylation (3Furuichi T.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, a family termed CaBP has been shown to interact with IP3R in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and to directly activate IP3R in the absence of IP3 (35Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.-O.D. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). IP3R has also been demonstrated to be physically coupled to its upstream or downstream signaling molecules by protein-protein interactions. For example, IP3R is coupled with group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) via the Homer family of proteins (36Tu J.C. Xiao B. Yuan J.P. Lanahan A.A. Leoffert K. Li M. Linden D.J. Worley P.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 717-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) and with B2 bradykinin receptors (B2Rs) by an unknown mechanism (37Delmas P. Wanaverbecq N. Abogadie F.C. Mistry M. Brown D.A. Neuron. 2002; 14: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Activations of mGluRs and B2Rs lead to the production of IP3 in proximity to IP3R, the result being efficient and specific signal propagation. Another example is Trp3, a candidate for plasma membrane Ca2+ channels regulated by intracellular Ca2+ store depletion (capacitative calcium entry channels). IP3R has been shown to interact with Trp3 directly, and to activate it via a conformational coupling mechanism (38Kiselyov K. Mignery G.A. Zhu M.X. Muallem S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 39Boulay G. Brown D.M. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M. Mikoshiba K. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). These protein-protein interactions are supposed to regulate the IP3/Ca2+ signaling pathway and contribute to the specificity of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics. To gain further insights into regulation of the IP3/Ca2+ signaling pathway, we searched for IP3R-binding proteins. In particular, we focused on molecules that interact with IP3R in a manner regulated by IP3, because such molecules may recognize the conformational change in IP3R induced by IP3binding, and/or may function as novel upstream or downstream signaling molecules of IP3R. For this purpose, we used an affinity column conjugated with the N-terminal 2217 amino acid residues of IP3R1 containing most of the large cytoplasmic region of the receptor molecule. By eluting bound proteins with IP3from this affinity column, we identified a novel IP3R-binding protein, IRBIT (IP3Rbinding protein released with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate). IRBIT bound to IP3R1 in vitro and in vivo, and co-localized intensively with IP3R1. Moreover, IRBIT was released from IP3R1 at a physiological concentration of IP3. On the basis of these results, we consider herein the role of IRBIT in IP3/Ca2+signaling. The cDNA encoding the N-terminal region of mouse IP3R1 (residues 1–225) was inserted into glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion vector pGEX-KG (40Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). The GST-IP3R1 (1–225) fragment was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pBlueBac4.5 (Invitrogen). The 3′-region downstream from the SmaI site of GST-IP3R1-(1–225) was replaced with theSmaI-EcoRI fragment of mouse IP3R1 (corresponding to residues 79–2217) to generate GST-IP3R1-(1–2217) (termed GST-EL, for the E coRI Large fragment) construct. GST alone was subcloned into pBlueBac4.5 as a control. Sf9 cells were cultured in TNM-FH medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 27 °C. Recombinant baculoviruses carrying GST-EL or GST were generated with the Bac-N-BlueTMtransfection kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. GST-EL and GST were expressed in 2 × 108Sf9 cells by infecting recombinant baculoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5, and incubating for 48 h. Cells were harvested and stored at −80 °C. Frozen cells were suspended in 10 ml of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin A, and 10 μm E-64), and were homogenized with a glass-Teflon homogenizer (1000 rpm, 10 strokes). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with 3 ml of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (AmershamBiosciences) for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing eight times with 40 ml of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100, GST-EL or GST coupled with glutathione-Sepharose was packed into columns and equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. About 5 mg of GST-EL was immobilized. Adult rat cerebella (∼5 g) were homogenized in 45 ml of homogenizer buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 320 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors) with a glass-Teflon homogenizer (950 rpm, 10 strokes), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (S1 fraction) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain the cytosolic fraction (the supernatant) and the crude microsome (the pellet). The crude microsome was homogenized in 25 ml of homogenizer buffer containing 500 mm NaCl with a glass-Teflon homogenizer (1,200 rpm, 10 strokes), incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to obtain the high salt extract (the supernatant) and the stripped-crude microsome (the pellet). The high salt extract was diluted five times with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Brij 35, and protease inhibitors. The diluted high salt extract was precleared with glutathione-Sepharose and loaded onto a GST-EL affinity column equilibrated with binding buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The GST column was used as a control. The columns were washed with 20 column volumes of binding buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with binding buffer containing 50 μm IP3 (Dojindo) and 0.05% Brij 35. The eluted material was concentrated, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on a 10% gel, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The 60-kDa protein band was excised from the gel and digested with lysyl endopeptidase (Wako) essentially according to the previously described method (41Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The polypeptides were separated by a C18 reversed-phase column (μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10, Amersham Biosciences) connected on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). The amino acid sequence of each peptide was determined by 494 procise protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Two peptide sequences, N-YSFMATVTK-C and N-QIQFADDMQEFTK-C were obtained. BLAST searches of two peptide sequences derived from the 60-kDa protein against the non-redundant data base revealed that these sequences match the sequence of a human cDNA deposited in a patent (GenBankTM accession numberCAC09285). Based on the data bases of mouse expressed sequence tags (accession number AW229870 and BE282170) homologous to this cDNA, primers (5′-ATGTCGATGCCTGACGCGATGC-3′ and 5′-GCGTGGTTCATGTGGACTGGTC-3′) were synthesized. cDNA of IRBIT was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using mouse cerebellum oligo(dT)-primed, first-strand cDNA as a template. PCR product was cloned into pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene) and sequenced. Sequences of three independent clones were confirmed. The cDNA encoding the N-terminal region (residues 1–104) of IRBIT was subcloned into the bacterial hexahistidine (His6) fusion vector pET-23a(+) (Novagen) to generate the IRBIT-(1–104)-His6 construct. The same cDNA was subcloned into the GST fusion vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) to generate the GST-IRBIT-(1–104) construct. The cDNA fragments corresponding to the amino acid residues 1–225, 1–343, 341–923, 600–1248, 916–1581, and 1553–1943 of mouse IP3R1 were inserted into pGEX-KG to generate the GST-Ia, GST-Iab, GST-IIab, GST-IIbIIIa, GST-IIIab, and GST-IV construct, respectively. Residues 1593–2217 of mouse IP3R1 were inserted into pGEX-4T-1 to generate the GST-IV-Va construct. These fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. GST-EL was expressed in Sf9 cells as described above. Expressed IRBIT-(1–104)-His6 was purified using ProBond resin (Invitrogen). GST fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose. GST-IbIIa (residues 224–604 of mouse IP3R1) and its site-directed mutants K508A and R441Q were described previously (Ref. 42Uchiyama T. Yoshikawa F. Hishida A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8106-8113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, GST-IbIIa was termed G224 therein). A Japanese white rabbit was immunized with purified IRBIT-(1–104)-His6 by subcutaneous injection with the complete Freund's adjuvant at 14-day intervals. The anti-IRBIT antisera was affinity-purified by passing serum from the immunized rabbit over a GST-IRBIT-(1–104) column covalently coupled with cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), and specific antibodies bound to the column were eluted with 100 mm glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). Cerebrum, cerebellum, heart, lung, liver, kidney, thymus, spleen, testis, and ovary were dissected from the adult mouse and S1 fraction were obtained essentially as described above. The cytosol, the crude microsome, the high salt extract, and the stripped-crude microsome of mouse cerebellum were obtained essentially as described above. Proteins with the amount indicated were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting. After blocking, membranes were immunoblotted with anti-IRBIT antibody (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNA encoding full-length IRBIT was subcloned into the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The cDNA encoding full-length IRBIT or its deletion mutants (residues 1–277, 1–104, and 105–530) were subcloned into the pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) to generate green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein constructs. Mouse IP3R1 expression vector pBact-STneoB-C1 was described previously (43Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1990; 5: 11-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C. Transient transfections were performed using TransIT transfection reagents (Mirus) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Transfected cells were processed for immunoblotting, pull-down experiments, or immunostaining 2 days after transfection. Mouse cerebellar cytosolic fraction was diluted two times with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% Triton X-100. The high salt extract was diluted five times with 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% Triton X-100. Diluted fractions (the final NaCl concentration of both fractions was 100 mm) were incubated with 20 μg of GST-EL or GST for 2 h at 4 °C. After adding 10 μl of glutathione-Sepharose and another 2-h incubation, the resins were washed five times with wash buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% Triton X-100), and bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione. Eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-IRBIT antibody. For dephosphorylation, the diluted high salt extract was incubated with or without bacterial alkaline phosphatase (Toyobo) in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C after which 5 mm EDTA was added, and the sample was processed for pull-down assay as described above. For the dissociation experiments, IRBIT in the diluted high salt extract was pulled down with GST-EL and washed as described above, and resins were added in 100 μl of wash buffer containing IP3, inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (IP2) (Dojindo), inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) (Calbiochem), inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (IP6) (Calbiochem), or ATP (Amersham Biosciences) (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 μm, each). After incubation on ice for 10 min, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 min, and the supernatant was subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-IRBIT antibody or goat anti-GST antibody (AmershamBiosciences). For quantitation, Alexa 680-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) was used as a secondary antibody. Intensity of fluorescence of immunoreactive bands of IRBIT was measured using Odyssey infrared imaging system (Aloka). Quantitative data (the mean ± S.D. from at least three independent experiments) are expressed as percentage of the amount of IRBIT in the 10 μm IP3 eluate. For the determination of the IRBIT binding region and the critical amino acids of IP3R1, the diluted high salt extract were processed for pull-down assay with 100 pmol of GST, GST-EL, GST-Ia, GST-Iab, GST-IbIIa, GST-IIab, GST-IIbIIIa, GST-IIIab, GST-IV, GST-IV-Va, K508A, or R441Q as described above and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-IRBIT antibody. For the determination of the IP3R1-interacting region of IRBIT, COS-7 cells expressing GFP-tagged full-length IRBIT or its truncated mutants were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min). The supernatants were processed for pull-down assay with GST-EL or GST as described above, and bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-GFP antibody (Medical & Biological Laboratories). Transfected COS-7 cells grown on glass coverslips were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, and blocked in PBS containing 2% normal goat serum for 60 min at room temperature. For washing out cytosolic proteins, transfected cells were washed once in PBS, permeabilized in ice-cold permeabilization buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 4% polyethylene glycol) containing 0.1% saponin for 10 min on ice, and washed twice with ice-cold permeabilization buffer before fixation. Cells were then stained with rabbit anti-IRBIT antibody (1 μg/ml for 60 min at room temperature) and rat anti-IP3R1 antibody 18A10 (44Maeda N. Niinobe M. Nakahira K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 1724-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C. Following four 5-min PBS washes, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes) were applied for 45 min at 37 °C. Following four 5-min PBS washes, the coverslips were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and observed under IX-70 confocal fluorescence microscopy (Olympus) with a ×60 objective. Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (45Shen L. Liang F. Walensky L.D. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7932-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Adult mouse cerebellum was homogenized in 10 volumes of 4 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 320 mm sucrose, and protease inhibitors with a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × gfor 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to another centrifugation at 9000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant from the second centrifugation was solubilized in 1% sodium deoxycholate at 36 °C for 30 min, followed by adding 0.1 volume of 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and the preparation was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was incubated with 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow (AmershamBiosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C to clarify nonspecific binding to the protein G beads. At the same time, 3 μg of rabbit anti-IRBIT antibody, control rabbit IgG, rat anti-IP3R1 antibody 10A6 (46Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K.

https://openalex.org/W1976373179,"We recently identified a novel mechanism for modulation of the phosphorylation state and function of theN-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor via the scaffolding protein RACK1. We found that RACK1 binds both the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor and the nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase, Fyn. RACK1 inhibits Fyn phosphorylation of NR2B and decreases NMDA receptor-mediated currents in CA1 hippocampal slices (Yaka, R., Thornton, C., Vagts, A. J., Phamluong, K., Bonci, A., and Ron, D. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 5710–5715). Here, we identified the signaling cascade by which RACK1 is released from the NMDA receptor complex and identified the consequences of the dissociation. We found that activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway in hippocampal slices induced the release of RACK1 from NR2B and Fyn. This resulted in the induction of NR2B phosphorylation and the enhancement of NMDA receptor-mediated activity via Fyn. We identified the neuropeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP(1–38)), as a ligand that induced phosphorylation of NR2B and enhanced NMDA receptor potentials. Finally, we found that activation of the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway induced the movement of RACK1 to the nuclear compartment in dissociated hippocampal neurons. Nuclear RACK1 in turn was found to regulate the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor induced by PACAP(1–38). Taken together our results suggest that activation of adenylate cyclase by PACAP(1–38) results in the release of RACK1 from the NMDA receptor and Fyn. This in turn leads to NMDA receptor phosphorylation, enhanced activity mediated by Fyn, and to the induction of brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression by RACK1.

Malenka R.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 515-525Google Scholar). The ligand-gated NMDA receptor channel is a heteromer comprised of NR1 and at least one of four NR2 subunits (A–D) (3Yamakura T. Shimoji K. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 59: 279-298Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of the NR2B subunit is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues (4Lau L.F. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20036-20041Google Scholar) and is the most abundant tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in the postsynaptic density (5Moon I.S. Apperson M.L. Kennedy M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3954-3958Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits regulates the activity of the channel (6Ali D.W. Salter M.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 336-342Google Scholar). Specifically, application of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor causes a progressive decrease in NMDA receptor-mediated currents, and conversely, inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatases results in an increase in NMDA receptor-mediated currents (7Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 233-235Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have identified the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) as enzymes that phosphorylate the NR2 subunits, regulating NMDA receptor activities (6Ali D.W. Salter M.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 336-342Google Scholar, 7Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 1994; 369: 233-235Google Scholar, 8Yu X.M. Askalan R. Keil II, G.J. Salter M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Google Scholar). Hence, modulation of NMDA receptor phosphorylation by Src family protein-tyrosine kinases is likely to play an important role in modulating glutamate-mediated pathways.In the recent years it has become increasingly apparent that the formation of localized signaling complexes, which include receptors, kinases, phosphatases and their substrates, are highly important for the regulation of signal transduction cascades (9Schillace R.V. Scott J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 761-765Google Scholar, 10Davare M.A. Avdonin V. Hall D.D. Peden E.M. Burette A. Weinberg R.J. Horne M.C. Hoshi T. Hell J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 98-101Google Scholar). Scaffolding proteins play a major role in the assembly of such signaling complexes (11Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 211-216Google Scholar). Recently, we identified the scaffolding protein RACK1 as a novel regulator of the phosphorylation state and function of the NMDA receptor. We found that RACK1 interacts with both the cytoplasmic tail of the NR2B subunit and Fyn and inhibits the ability of Fyn to phosphorylate the NR2B subunit and consequently inhibits NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in CA1 hippocampal neurons (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar). Peptides that inhibit the interactions between RACK1 and Fyn and RACK1 and NR2B restored the ability of Fyn to phosphorylate NR2B in the presence of RACK1, and enhanced NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs via activation of the Src family protein-tyrosine kinase Fyn (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar). Based on these results we propose a model wherein RACK1 localizes Fyn in close proximity with its substrate the NR2B subunit but prevents the phosphorylation of the subunit until the appropriate signal occurs. This signal should cause the dissociation of RACK1 from the NMDA receptor complex, allowing Fyn to phosphorylate the channel, resulting in enhanced channel activity.Although it is well established that activation of Src family protein-tyrosine kinases such as Fyn are required for the phosphorylation of NMDA receptor subunits and the regulation of channel activity, the signaling cascades that lead to kinase activation and the subsequent phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor subunits are not fully understood. Here we identify a signaling pathway that induces the release of RACK1 from the NMDA receptor complex and the functional consequences of RACK1 dissociation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsThe polyclonal anti-Fyn, anti-NR2B, anti-NR2A, and anti-CREB antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies.

Zigmond R.E. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2002; 295: 491-495Google Scholar). Forskolin, ifenprodil, and picrotoxin were purchased from Sigma. Ovine PACAP(1–38), 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, and protein phosphatase 2 were purchased from Calbiochem. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Alexis Corporation. NBQX and d-AP5 were purchased from Tocris. Sodium orthovanadate was purchased from Sigma and prepared according to manufacturer's instructions.AnimalsFyn−/− mice (129SvImJ/C57BL.6J hybrids) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Mice were mated in-house with 129/SVJ wild type mice to generate Fyn+/−mice. Fyn+/− mice were then mated to generate Fyn−/− and Fyn+/+ littermate controls, which were used for biochemical and electrophysiological experiments. The genotyping of mice was determined by RT-PCR analysis of products derived from tail mRNA. Only male mice were used in the studies. The age of the individuals ranged from 3 to 5 weeks. For each colony, mice were randomly (with respect to the genotype) housed in groups of five individuals in Plexiglas cages. Food and water were availablead libitum. Animals were kept in conditions of constant temperature (23 °C), humidity (50%), and light-dark cycle (light on from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm). 3–4-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Simonsen and kept under the same conditions.Recombinant ProteinsFull-length RACK1 amino acids 1–317 (Tat-RACK1), N-terminal fragment of RACK1 amino acids 1–180 (RACK1ΔC), or C-terminal fragment of RACK1 amino acids 138–317 (RACK1ΔN) were subcloned into pTAT-HA and expressed in and purified from Escherichia colias described previously (13He D.-Y. Vagts A.J. Yaka R. Ron D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 272-280Google Scholar).Preparation of Slice HomogenatesTransverse hippocampal slices (250–300 μm) were prepared from 3–4-week-old male rats or Fyn−/− and Fyn+/+mice. Slices were maintained for at least 2 h in artificial cerebrospinal fluid that contained 126 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 0.01 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mmCaCl2, 18 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mm glucose, saturated with 95%O2 and 5%CO2 at 25 °C. After a 1–2-h recovery, slices were treated and prepared as 10% homogenates in ice-cold 320 mmsucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor mixture, and phosphatase inhibitor mixture, with a glass/Teflon homogenizer (12 strokes). After a short centrifugation (1000 × g, 2 min, 4 °C), to remove nuclei and large debris, the supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to obtain crude synaptosomal fraction. The membranal pellet was resuspended in solubilization buffer (1% deoxycholate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture).ImmunoprecipitationThe membranal fraction from brain homogenates was precleared by incubation with protein G-agarose (Invitrogen). The samples were centrifuged, and the protein quantity was determined using bicinchoninic (BCA) reagent (Pierce). Immunoprecipitation was performed with 5 μg of the appropriate antibodies, with ∼0.5 mg of protein diluted in 1× immunoprecipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures). After overnight incubation at 4 °C, protein G-agarose was added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The agarose resin was washed extensively and samples resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. Membranes were probed with the appropriate antibodies, and immunoreactivity was detected with ECL and processed using the STORM system.Primary Hippocampal NeuronsNewborn rats at P0 were decapitated, and hippocampi were dissected bilaterally. Cells were dissociated by enzyme digestion with papain followed by brief mechanical trituration and plated on poly-d-lysine- (Sigma) treated chamber slides (Nalgene). Cells were plated (1 × 105 cells/chamber) and maintained in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27, penicillin, streptomycin, and Glutamax-1 (Invitrogen) and maintained in culture for 3 weeks.ImmunocytochemistryAfter treatment, RACK1 immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (14Ron D. Vagts A.J. Dohrman D.P. Yaka R. Jiang Z. Yao L. Crabbe J. Grisel J.E. Diamond I. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2303-2314Google Scholar, 15Ron D. Jiang Z. Yao L. Vagts A. Diamond I. Gordon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27039-27046Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100, fixed in cold methanol, and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 3% normal goat serum. Immunofluorescence was performed with monoclonal IgM anti-RACK1 (1:100). Staining was detected with secondary antibodies conjugated to Texas Red (1:250). Slides were viewed with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Bio-Rad MRC-1024). Z field images were processed by obtaining the middle Z field sections using NIH Image 1.61 (National Institutes of Health) and Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.).Nuclear ExtractionHippocampal slices were homogenized, and nuclear and non-nuclear extracts were prepared using an NE-PER kit in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce).ElectrophysiologyTransverse hippocampal slices (400–450 μm) were prepared from 3–5-week-old male Fyn+/+, Fyn−/− mice or 3–4-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. The slices were allowed to recover for at least 1–2 h in artificial cerebrospinal fluid perfusion medium as described above. After recovery, slices were submerged and superfused continuously with artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 25 °C. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from stratum-radiatum of CA1 region with glass microelectrodes filled with 2 m NaCl. To obtain NMDA receptor-mediated fEPSPs, 100 μm picrotoxin and 10 μm NBQX were added to the bath solution to block γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor- and (AMPA) α-amino, 3-hydroxy, 5-methyl, 4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor-mediated IPSPs and EPSPs, respectively. To evoke fEPSPs, Schaffer collateral/commissural afferents were stimulated with 0.1-Hz pulses using steel bipolar microelectrodes at intensities adjusted to produce an evoked response that was 50% of the maximum-recorded fEPSP for each recording. The maximal rate of change in fEPSP within a time window selected around the rising phase was calculated. Data were collected using an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 2 kHz, and digitized at 5–10 kHz. To obtain AMPA receptor-mediated fEPSPs, 100 μm picrotoxin and 50 μm d-AP5 were added to the bath solution to block γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor- and NMDA receptor-mediated IPSPs and EPSPs, respectively.RT-PCRTotal RNAs were isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using a Reverse Transcription System kit (Promega) at 42 °C for 30 min. BDNF and control GPDHexpression were analyzed by PCR with temperature cycling parameters consisting of initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 52 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 1 min, and a final incubation at 72 °C for 7 min. The BDNF primers were based on a coding frame of the rat BDNF gene: upstream, 5′-TTG AGC ACG TGA TCG AAG AGC-3′, and downstream, 5′-GTT CGG CAT TGC GAG TTC CAG-3′. TheGPDH primers were based on the rat GPDH gene: upstream, 5′-TGA AGG TCG GTG TCA ACG GAT TTG GC-3′, and downstream, 5′-CAT GTA GGC CAT GAG GTC CAC CAC-3′. The PCR products were separated by 1.8% agarose gel and photographed by Eagle Eye II (Stratagene).Data AnalysisNR2 PhosphorylationScanned images of the bands corresponding to NMDA receptor subunits were quantitatively analyzed by densitometry with the NIH Image 1.61 program providing peak areas; values were expressed as a ratio of phosphorylated to total amount of NMDA receptor subunits. At the conditions used, all blots were within the linear range. Statistical analysis was performed using Student'st test for significant differences.BDNF mRNA ExpressionScanned images of the RT-PCR products were analyzed quantitatively by densitometry with the NIH Image 1.61 program. The intensities of BDNF and the corresponding GPDH controls were measured, and the BDNF:GPDH ratio was calculated. The results are presented as the mean ratio ± S.D. Titration of the GPDH RT-PCR was performed using 5-cycle increments from 20 to 60 cycles. At the conditions used (35 cycles), GPDH amplification was observed to be within the linear range.DISCUSSIONCompartmentalization of signaling proteins in close proximity to the NMDA receptor is highly important for the regulation of phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor subunits and the regulation of function of NMDA receptor activity. Recently, we identified RACK1 as a scaffolding protein for Fyn kinase and the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor and revealed a novel molecular mechanism by which RACK1 modulates the function of Fyn and the NMDA receptor (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar). RACK1 binds directly to both Fyn and the cytoplasmic tail of NR2B, inhibits the phosphorylation of NR2B by Fyn, and decreases NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs in CA1 hippocampal neurons (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar). Here, we identified the cAMP/PKA pathway as an important signaling mechanism responsible for 1) the release of RACK1 from the NMDA receptor complex, 2) the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit, 3) the increase in NMDA receptor-mediated fEPSPs in hippocampal slices in a Fyn-dependent manner, and 4) the increase in BDNF expression via RACK1. Based on our results we propose the following model (Fig. 8). RACK1 binds the cytoplasmic tail of NR2B and Fyn. This allows Fyn to be localized in close proximity to its substrate. However, when RACK1 is present in the complex, Fyn cannot phosphorylate NR2B (Fig. 8 a). Activation of adenylate cyclase by forskolin or activation of Gs -coupled PACAP(1–38) receptors that activate the cAMP/PKA pathway releases RACK1 from NR2B and Fyn and induces its nuclear compartmentalization (Fig. 8 b). Once RACK1 is removed from the NMDA receptor, Fyn is then free to phosphorylate NR2B, which in turn results in an increase in the activity of the NMDA receptor channel. Lastly, nuclear RACK1 will induce the expression of BDNF (Fig. 8 b).We found that the activation of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway resulted in the release of RACK1 from the NMDA receptor complex. Several reports suggest a link among RACK1, cAMP signaling, and NMDA receptors. Yarwoodet al. (30Yarwood S.J. Steele M.R. Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14909-14917Google Scholar) identified a direct interaction between RACK1 and the cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase 4 isoform phosphodiesterase 5 (30Yarwood S.J. Steele M.R. Scotland G. Houslay M.D. Bolger G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14909-14917Google Scholar), and recently phosphodiesterase 4 was found to regulate the function of the NMDA receptor and thus is likely to be part of the postsynaptic density complex as well (31Suvarna N.U. O'Donnell J.M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 249-256Google Scholar). Moreover, several reports suggest a link between cAMP/PKA signaling and the phosphorylation state and activity of the NMDA receptor channel. In vitro, PKA phosphorylates the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor (32Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12107-12115Google Scholar, 33Tingley W.G. Ehlers M.D. Kameyama K. Doherty C. Ptak J.B. Riley C.T. Huganir R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5157-5166Google Scholar). Forskolin enhances NMDA receptor activity in spinal cord dorsal horn neurons and in hippocampal neurons in culture (34Cerne R. Rusin K.I. Randic M. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 161: 124-128Google Scholar, 35Raman I.M. Tong G. Jahr C.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 415-421Google Scholar), and the NMDA receptor-associated protein, Yotiao (36Lin J.W. Wyszynski M. Madhavan R. Sealock R. Kim J.U. Sheng M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2017-2027Google Scholar), interacts with PKA holoenzyme and type 1 protein phosphatase (37Westphal R.S. Tavalin S.J. Lin J.W. Alto N.M. Fraser I.D. Langeberg L.K. Sheng M. Scott J.D. Science. 1999; 285: 93-96Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the cAMP machinery is compartmentalized within close proximity to RACK1 and the NMDA receptor, allowing the rapid dissociation of RACK1 upon activation of a Gαs-coupled receptor, and the rapid regulation of the NMDA receptor function.We identified the neuropeptide PACAP(1–38) as a ligand responsible for the phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit and the enhancement of NMDA receptor-mediated activities via Fyn. PACAP(1–38) mediates its activities via two receptors, type 1 (PAC1), which binds PACAP(1–38) in high affinity, and type 2 (PAC2), which binds PACAP(1–38) and vasoactive intestinal peptide at equal affinities (38Sreedharan S.P. Huang J.X. Cheung M.C. Goetzl E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2939-2943Google Scholar). The PAC1 receptor is highly expressed in several regions of the central nervous system including the hippocampus (38Sreedharan S.P. Huang J.X. Cheung M.C. Goetzl E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2939-2943Google Scholar). The hippocampus mainly expresses the PAC1 but not PAC2 receptors (39Masuo Y. Ohtaki T. Masuda Y. Tsuda M. Fujino M. Brain Res. 1992; 575: 113-123Google Scholar), and electron microscope studies revealed that the PAC1 receptors are found in postsynaptic densities of synaptic junctions in brain regions including the hippocampus (40Shioda S. Shuto Y. Somogyvari-Vigh A. Legradi G. Onda H. Coy D.H. Nakajo S. Arimura A. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 28: 345-354Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B occurs via activation of the PAC1 receptors by PACAP(1–38). PAC1 receptors are coupled mainly to the cAMP/PKA pathway via Gαs, but also to the phospholipase C/PKC pathway via activation of Gαq-coupled receptors (19Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that PACAP(1–38) is mediating the phosphorylation of NR2B and the enhancement of NMDA receptor activities via the PLC/PKC pathway. First, we could not detect dissociation of the NR2B·RACK1·Fyn complex upon activation of PKC with the PKC activator PMA. Second, activation of the phospholipase C/PKC pathway requires higher concentrations of PACAP(1–38) (41Basille M. Gonzalez B.J. Desrues L. Demas M. Fournier A. Vaudry H. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1318-1324Google Scholar) compared with the concentrations used here, which enhanced the phosphorylation and function of the NMDA receptor. Interestingly, PACAP(1–38) has been implicated in learning and memory. PAC1 deletion mutant mice show deficits in contextual fear conditioning, which is a hippocampus-dependent associative learning, and in a passive avoidance learning (42Telegdy G. Kokavszky K. Brain Res. 2000; 874: 194-199Google Scholar), and thet also show impairment of hippocampal mossy fiber long term potentiation (43Otto C. Kovalchuk Y. Wolfer D.P. Gass P. Martin M. Zuschratter W. Grone H.J. Kellendonk C. Tronche F. Maldonado R. Lipp H.P. Konnerth A. Schutz G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5520-5527Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the enhancement of NMDA receptor function by PACAP(1–38) is important for synaptic plasticity, a process that underlies several forms of learning and memory.In addition to PACAP(1–38) activities on NMDA receptor, we found that the peptide enhanced the expression of BDNF via nuclear RACK1. Recently, we found that in C6 glioma cells nuclear RACK1 mediates the induction of expression of the immediate early gene c-fos in a cAMP/PKA-dependent manner (13He D.-Y. Vagts A.J. Yaka R. Ron D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 272-280Google Scholar). In cerebellar granule cells, PACAP(1–38) was found to induce c-fos expression via the cAMP/PKA pathway (28Vaudry D. Basille M. Anouar Y. Fournier A. Vaudry H. Gonzalez B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 865: 92-99Google Scholar). Because the promoter region of BDNF contains several AP1 sites (44Hayes V.Y. Towner M.D. Isackson P.J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 189-198Google Scholar), it is possible that PACAP(1–38) induces BDNF expression via c-fos. Interestingly, BDNF has also been strongly implicated in the mechanism leading to enhancement of synaptic strength (45Thoenen H. Science. 1995; 270: 593-598Google Scholar). Presynaptically, BDNF enhances glutamate release in hippocampal neurons (46Lessmann V. Gottmann K. Heumann R. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 21-25Google Scholar, 47Gottschalk W. Pozzo-Miller L.D. Figurov A. Lu B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6830-6839Google Scholar, 48Li Y.X. Zhang Y. Lester H.A. Schuman E.M. Davidson N. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10231-10240Google Scholar). Postsynaptically, BDNF enhances the activity of NMDA receptors (49Levine E.S. Dreyfus C.F. Black I.B. Plummer M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8074-8077Google Scholar, 50Levine E.S.

Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 55: 20-27Google Scholar). BDNF is essential for the formation of long-term potentiation, and BDNF knockout mice have impaired long-term potentiation that is restored with viral infection of BDNF (52Korte M. Carroll P. Wolf E.

Neuron. 1999; 24: 401-414Google Scholar). In addition, in excised membrane patches from cultured hippocampal neurons, acute exposure to BDNF increases NMDA single channel open probability, and this effect is dependent on the presence of the NR2B subunit (58Levine E.S. Kolb J.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 62: 357-362Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that the increase in BDNF levels via the nuclear compartmentalization of RACK1 initiates a positive feedback loop for further enhancing the function of hippocampal NMDA receptors.In summary, we have identified cAMP/PKA as an important regulatory signaling pathway for the localization and function of the scaffolding protein RACK1. The movement of other scaffolding proteins has been shown to be important for proper transduction of signaling cascades and regulation of gene expression. For example, the scaffolding protein STE5 moves to the nucleus to induce transcription (59Mahanty S.K. Wang Y. Farley F.W. Elion E.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 501-512Google Scholar). The dual function of RACK1 in response to cAMP/PKA activation, i.e.an enhancement in NMDA receptor phosphorylation and activity as well as an increase in expression of BDNF, leads to the interesting possibility that the dynamic compartmentalization of scaffolding proteins adds yet another dimension to signaling events. Our results also suggest that the dynamic compartmentalization of RACK1 is important for the regulation of processes leading to synaptic plasticity.

Studies with the Y1-receptor antagonist and Y4-receptor agonist GR231118, which binds with a 250-fold higher affinity than its monomer, led to the first speculation that NPY receptors can form homodimers. In the present work we used the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to study homodimerization of the hY1-, hY2-, and hY5-receptors in living cells. For this purpose, we generated fusion proteins of NPY receptors and green fluorescent protein or spectral variants of green fluorescent protein (cyan, yellow, and red fluorescent protein), which can be used as FRET pairs. Two different FRET techniques, fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy, were applied. Both techniques clearly showed that the hY1-, hY2-, and hY5-NPY receptor subtypes are able to form homodimers. By using transiently transfected cells, as well as a stable cell line expressing the hY2-GFP fusion protein, we could demonstrate that the Y-GFP fusion proteins are still functional and that dimerization varies from 26 to 44% dependent on the receptor. However, homodimerization is influenced neither by NPY nor by Gα protein binding.

Drug Discov. Today. 1996; 1: 502-513Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). GPCRs are found in a wide range of organisms, and many kind of chemical messengers act through them, for example adrenalin, angiotensin, or neuropeptide Y (NPY). Ligands for GPCRs are involved in a broad range of physiological functions, and their malfunction is responsible for many diseases (2Edwards S.W. Tan C.M. Limbird L.E. Trends Pharmacol.

Because of the development of new fluorescent dyes, novel fluorescent proteins, and new instrumentation, the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) obtained a renaissance (30Selvin P.R. Nat.

This technique measures the transfer of energy from a donor molecule to an acceptor molecule when they are between 1–10 nm apart (Fig. 1) (32Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The FRET technique was successfully applied for the GPCR gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (31Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Maya-Nunez G. Conn P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2153-2158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FRET was successfully used for the investigation of transmembrane transporters like the serotonin transporter (33Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor receptor (34Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr.

NPY receptors belong to the rhodopsin-like superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (35Michel M.C. Beck-Sickinger A. Cox H. Doods H.N. Herzog H. Larhammar D. Quirion R. Schwartz T. Westfall T. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar). So far five distinct NPY receptors have been cloned (Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5, and y6) (36Blomqvist A.G. Herzog H. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 294-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Their activation results in the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. The natural ligand of these receptors is NPY, a 36-amino acid peptide amide that belongs to the family of pancreatic polypeptides (37Cabrele C. Beck-Sickinger A. J. Peptide Sci. 2000; 6: 97-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). NPY modulates numerous physiological processes including regulation of cardiovascular (38Wahlestedt C. Yanaihara N. Hakanson R. Regul. Pept. 1986; 13: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and renal functions, intestinal motility, memory (39Flood J.F. Hernandez E.N. Morley J.E. Brain Res. 1987; 421: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), anxiety, seizures, feeding (40Inui A. Trends Pharmacol.

Pept. 1990; 27: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and nociception. First speculations for homodimerization come from studies with recently reported truncated NPY analogues named ([P30,C31,F32,L34] NPY28–36 and [P30,C31,W32,L34]NPY28–36) (42Matthews J.E. Jansen M.

A. 1995; 92: 9067-9071Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) that bind after dimerization with a higher affinity to the hY1-receptor. Furthermore, the homodimeric, peptidergic GR231118 (Y1-antagonist, Y4-agonist) obtains a higher affinity for the Y1-receptor than its monomeric form (42Matthews J.E. Jansen M. Lyerly D. Cox R.

A. 1995; 92: 9067-9071Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).To investigate homodimerization of NPY receptors by FRET, we generated fusion proteins of the hY1-, hY2-, or hY5-receptor sequence tagged at their carboxyl terminus to the green, cyan, yellow, or red fluorescent protein (GFP, CFP, YFP, DSRed), respectively. The advantage of these proteins is that they have the suited properties to be used as FRET pairs (44Harpur A.G. Wouters F.S. Bastiaens P.I. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 167-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 45Patterson G.H. Piston D.W. Barisas B.G. Anal.

Cytometry. 2001; 44: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). CFP and YFP are spectral variants of GFP and have an appropriate spectral overlap of the donor (CFP) emission and the acceptor (YFP) excitation (47Pollok B.A. Heim R. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 57-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). This pair of proteins has been used widely for the investigation of protein-protein interaction (33Schmid J.A. Scholze P. Kudlacek O. Freissmuth M. Singer E.A. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 34Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The FRET pair with GFP as donor and DSRed as acceptor is a second successfully applied FRET pair (31Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Maya-Nunez G. Conn P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2153-2158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Binding and functional studies showed that these receptor-GFP fusion proteins are still active. Furthermore, the establishment of a cell line that stably expresses the hY2-GFP fusion protein was generated to quantify receptor expression and to correlate the number of binding sites to the fluorescence emission. Coexpression of the FRET pair receptors hY1-CFP/hY1-YFP, hY1-GFP/hY1-DSRed, hY2-CFP/hY2-YFP, hY2-GFP/hY2-DSRed, hY5-CFP/hY5-YFP, and hY5-GFP/hY5-DSRed was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. A significant FRET effect was found with both techniques and both FRET pairs in a receptor subtype-dependent manner. Whereas the hY2-receptor was less prone to dimerization, hY1 and hY5 had a strong tendency. However, the FRET effect was neither dependent on agonist stimulation nor on GTPγS incubation as shown by quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAll materials for tissue culture were supplied by Invitrogen. 3H-NPY was purchased from AmershamBiosciences (specific activity 2.59 TBq/mmol). Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were from Invitrogen, and forskolin, Pefabloc SC, pepstatin,N-(trans-epoxysuccinyl)-l-leucine-4-guanidinobutylamide (E64), sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium chloride, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and glucose were from Fluka (Taufkirchen, Germany). Bovine serum albumin, bacitracin, puromycin, and HEPES were supplied by Sigma. Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG-Biotech AG (München, Germany).Vector ConstructionTo create human NPY Y1-, Y2-, Y5-receptor fusion proteins with GFP, CFP, YFP, and DSRed, respectively, appropriate expression vectors were cloned. PCR withTaq polymerase was used to amplify the hY1-, hY2-, and hY5-receptor sequences, which are cloned in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). An amino-terminal primer, 5′-CTGCTTACTGGCTTATCG-3′, upstream of the HindIII site of the multicloning site of pcDNA3 was combined with a primer designed against the carboxyl terminus, where the stop codon is replaced by a restriction site and there is an additional codon for alanine. The carboxy-terminal primer, 5′-CGCGGATCCCAGATTTTTTCATTATCATCATTGTTG-3′, with a BamHI site, was used for amplifying the hY1-sequence, the carboxy-terminal primer, 5′-CGCGGATCCGCGACATTGGTAGCCTCTG-3′, with a BamHI site, was used for amplifying the hY2-sequence, and the antisense primer, 5′-CGCGTCGACCCCATATGAAGACAGTGTATAAG-3′, with aSalI site, was used for amplifying the hY5-sequence. After PCR the receptor sequences were subcloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen), respectively, amplified, and digested with HindIII and BamHI orHindIII and SalI. To obtain the hY1-pEGFP, hY2-pEGFP, and hY5-pEGFP vectors the plasmid pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) was digested either with HindIII and BamHI or withHindIII and SalI. The digested vector was ligated to the receptor sequences obtained from pCR2.1-TOPO vector, respectively. Expression vectors with the hY1-, hY2-, and hY5-sequence and CFP, YFP, and DSRed, respectively, were cloned in the same way by using the pECFP-N1 vector (Clontech), pEYFP-N1 vector (Clontech), or the pDSRed-N1 vector (Clontech). The constructs were verified by restriction and sequence analysis.Construction of Positive Control Fusion ProteinsAs a positive control for FRET imaging and measurements, we constructed two different fusion proteins of hY1-receptor, GFP and DSRed and hY2-receptor, YFP and CFP. The hY1-GFP-DSRed vector was cloned in two steps. First, a hY1-pEGFP fusion protein without stop codon in the fusion protein sequence was generated. Therefore, the hY1-pEGFP vector was used as template, and PCR was performed with the amino-terminal primer, 5′-ATCTGGGATCCACCGG-3′, and the carboxy-terminal primer, 5′-TCCTCCGCGGCCGCTCCCTTGTACAGCTCG-3′, to generate the hY1-GFP(−stop) sequence. After digestion the hY1-GFP sequence of the hY1-pEGFP vector was replaced by hY1-GFP(−stop). In the second step the DSRed sequence was amplified by using PCR. Two primers were generated, the sense primer, 5′-GGCGGCGGCGCGGCCGCGATCAATCTCATCACCAGACAGAGATATGGCAAGAGATCCAGCCCTGAGACACTGATTGGCATGGTGCGCTCCTCC-3′, with a NotI site and a restriction site for convertase I, and the antisense primer, 5′-GCCTCTAGAGCCCTACAGGAACAGGTGG-3′, with aXbaI site. The vector hY1-pEGFP(−stop) was digested withBamHI and XbaI, and the DSRed sequence was subcloned. The construct was verified by restriction and sequence analysis.For the cloning of the hY2-YFP-CFP vector the pEYFP-CFP-tandem vector, which was a generous gift from Professor Horn (University of Leipzig), was used as backbone, and the hY2-receptor sequence was amplified by PCR. The amino-terminal primer, 5′-GGCGGCGCTAGCATGGGTCCAATAGGTGC-3′, with aNheI site, and carboxy-terminal primer, 5′-GGCGGCCTCGAGGGCGACATTGGTAGCCTCTG-3′, with a XhoI site, were used for PCR. The hY2-CFP-YFP-tandem was digested withNheI and XhoI, and the hY2-sequence was subcloned. The vector was verified by restriction and sequence analysis.Cell Culture and TransfectionBHK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, and CHO cells were grown in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/50% nutrient mix Ham's F-12 with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were cultured as monolayers in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. BHK and CHO cells do not express endogenous NPY receptors.For transient transfection cells were seeded in 25-cm2flasks. At 90% confluency each well was transiently transfected with 13 μg of reporter plasmid DNA using 26 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cotransfection 6.5 μg of each vector was used. For transient transfection 4.7 μg of vector and 9.4 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 was used for each well of a six-well plate, and 1 μg of vector and 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 was applied for each well of a 24-well plate.To generate a cell line stably expressing hY2-GFP receptors BHK cells were cotransfected with hY2-GFP and pBabePuro vector (48Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Three days after transfection cells were seeded and maintained in medium with 8 μg/ml puromycin. The medium was changed every 4 days. After 4 weeks stable transformants were isolated by FACS sorting with a Vantage SE FACS machine (BD Biosciences). FACS sorting was repeated three times. There was a period of 4 weeks between each sorting. Clonal expression was confirmed by fluorescent microscopy.Competition Binding AssayFor binding studies BHK or CHO cells were transiently transfected with the corresponding plasmid 24 h before analysis. Cells were resuspended in incubation buffer (minimum essential medium with Earl's salts containing 0.1% bacitracin, 50 mm Pefabloc SC, and 1% bovine serum albumin). 200 μl of the suspension, containing 4.0 × 10−6 cells per ml, were incubated with 25 μl of a 10 nm solution of3H-propionyl-NPY (specific activity 2.59 TBq/mmol) and 25 μl of NPY in a concentration range of 1 pm to 1 μm. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled NPY. After 1.5 h at room temperature, the incubation was terminated by centrifugation at 1600 ×g at 4 °C for 5 min. The pellets were washed once with 400 μl of cold PBS and centrifuged again, and the washed pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of PBS. The cell suspension was mixed with 3 ml of scintillation mixture, and radioactivity was measured by a β-counter. The IC50 value was calculated with the software Prism 3.0 (Graph Pad). Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and IC50 ± S.E. are shown in Table I.Table INPY binding properties of fusion proteinsReceptorBinding assayIC50Total bindingUnspecific bindingSpecific bindingnmhY1(wt)1.6 ± 0.52957 ± 711095 ± 441862 ± 96hY1-GFP2.6 ± 0.54481 ± 109719 ± 1633762 ± 226hY1-DSRed3.0 ± 0.93521 ± 245957 ± 1712561 ± 345hY1-CFP1.6 ± 1.12958 ± 711095 ± 441862 ± 96hY1-YFP10.2 ± 0.47379 ± 1161819 ± 1036559 ± 1346hY2(wt)5.4 ± 1.11594 ± 211185 ± 5410 ± 25hY2-GFP13.0 ± 4.02958 ± 711095 ± 441862 ± 96hY2-DSRed8.6 ± 0.72016 ± 501037 ± 93979 ± 122hY2-CFP3.8 ± 1.46703 ± 1351510 ± 165193 ± 157hY2-YFP2.1 ± 0.56295 ± 581326 ± 84969 ± 68hY5(wt)7.2 ± 5.01895 ± 2621173 ± 51817 ± 340hY5-GFP16.1 ± 5.06820 ± 3601237 ± 545583 ± 420hY5-DSRed16.2 ± 9.23308 ± 2441065 ± 1042242 ± 306hY5-CFP5.6 ± 2.32958 ± 711095 ± 441862 ± 96hY5-YFP6.8 ± 3.55083 ± 699692 ± 2804391 ± 869hY1-GFP-DSRed3.1 ± 2.02816 ± 1781174 ± 4781641 ± 589hY2-YFP-CFP1.8 ± 0.15400 ± 5.871478 ± 403922 ± 47 Open table in a new tab For saturation experiments BHK cells stably expressing hY2-GFP were incubated with increasing concentrations of3H-propionyl-NPY between 0.1 pmol and 8 nmol. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10−6m unlabeled porcine NPY. The assay was performed three times independently.Assays for cAMP ConcentrationThe intracellular amount of cAMP was determined either by using a cAMP enzyme immunoassay (Biotrak, Amersham, Freiburg, Germany) or with a luciferase reporter gene assay. To perform cAMP enzyme immunoassays BHK or CHO cells were transiently transfected with the corresponding plasmid 24 h in advance. When the cells were grown to confluency, they were resuspended in cAMP buffer (145 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 10 mmglucose, 0.1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, pH 7.4, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Then 2 million cells were incubated with 15 μm forskolin and 1 μm NPY for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were preincubated with 1 μm NPY for 1 h and then forskolin was added. Incubation was stopped by addition of 100 μl of a 1 msolution of HCl. Cell lysis was done by freezing, followed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was diluted 1:5. Reactions were performed according to the protocol of the manufacturer for the cAMP enzyme immunoassay. The optical density was determined with a plate reader (Tecan SpectraFluorPlus) at 450 nm. The assay was done in duplicate and repeated three times. The reporter gene assay using the pCRELuc plasmid (Stratagene) was performed as reported recently (49Dinger M.C. Beck-Sickinger A.G. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 21: 9-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Fluorescence MicroscopyFluorescence microscopy with cells coexpressing CFP and YFP receptor fusion proteins was done on a Leica DM IRB microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). BHK cells were seeded on 24-well plates and transiently cotransfected with the corresponding constructs 24 h before studying by fluorescence microscopy. As excitation source a polychrome VI laser from Photonics was used. CFP was excited at 433 nm, and YFP was excited at 513 nm, and emission was detected with different filter sets (AHF Analysentechnik, Tübingen, Germany). A CFP filter with a D480/40 emitter and a 455 DCLP beamsplitter, a YFP filter with an HQ535/30 emitter and a Q515 1p beamsplitter and a FRET filter (emitter D535/30, beamsplitter 455 DCLP) were used. For FRET microscopy studies cells were excited at 433 nm, and for emission detection the YFP filter was used. Cells were washed two times with PBS and covered with 0.5 ml of PBS and then images were taken with a cooled digital Orca-ER camera (Hamamatsu, Herrsching, Germany). For imaging the openlab software (Improvision, Heidelberg, Germany) was used.For quantitative FRET measurement the method of sensitized FRET was used (34Sorkin A. McClure M. Huang F. Carter R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Calculations of corrected FRET (FRETc) were carried out on a pixel-by-pixel basis for the entire image. The bleedthrough of CFP and YFP through the FRET filter channel was regarded exerting the following equation: FRETc = FRET − (bleedthrough CFP × CFP) − (bleedthrough YFP × YFP). FRETc images are displayed as YFP intensity-modulated images (51Jiang X. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) in pseudocolor mode, where red areas display high values of FRET, and blue areas display low values of FRET. The overall intensity of FRET was calculated using openlab software.Confocal ImagingGeneralBHK cells expressing both NPY receptor-C tail-GFP and NPY receptor-C tail-DSRed were imaged in a 6-well plate in PBS at room temperature in a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using a water immersion objective. GFP was excited with the 488-nm line of an argon laser, and DSRed was excited with the 568-nm line of a krypton laser. Emission was measured simultaneously in the green channel and in the red channel.Photobleaching FRET AnalysisFRET was measured in fixed cells by continuous illumination of the acceptor (red fusion protein) with the 568-nm line of the Kr laser, which was sufficient to bleach the acceptor. Images of GFP were taken before and after the red fluorescent protein was photobleached. The increase of donor fluorescence (green) after receptor (red) bleaching was interpreted as evidence of FRET occurring from GFP to DSRed.Fluorescence SpectroscopyThe spectrofluorometric studies were carried out at a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon Spex, Longjumeau, France). For excitation a 450-watt xenon lamp was used.To study FRET effects between the different NPY receptor subtypes BHK cells were seeded in 25-cm2 culture flasks. The cells were transiently cotransfected with equal amount of the same receptor subtype fused to CFP and YFP, respectively, 24 h before measurements.The cells were washed with PBS, treated with trypsin/EDTA, and resuspended with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing fetal calf serum and protease inhibitors (Pefabloc 5 mm, pepstatin 0.7 μg/ml, E64 10 μg/ml). For each measurement 1.0 × 106 cotransfected cells from the same cell pool were incubated with 1 μm, 0.1 μm, and 0.1 nm NPY for 30 min, respectively, and in parallel, the cells were also incubated with 1 μm NPY for 10, 30, and 60 min.

https://openalex.org/W2138311952,"Multidrug resistance in acute myeloid leukemia is often conferred by overexpression of P-glycoprotein, encoded by the MDR1 gene. We have characterized the key regulatory steps in the development of multidrug resistance in K562 myelogenous leukemic cells. Unexpectedly, up-regulation ofMDR1 levels was not due to transcriptional activation but was achieved at two distinct post-transcriptional steps, mRNA turnover and translational regulation. The short-lived (half-life 1 h) MDR1 mRNA of naı̈ve cells (not exposed to drugs) was stabilized (half-life greater than 10 h) following short-term drug exposure. However, this stabilized mRNA was not associated with translating polyribosomes and did not direct P-glycoprotein synthesis. Selection for drug resistance, by long-term exposure to drug, led to resistant lines in which the translational block was overcome such that the stabilized mRNA was translated and P-glycoprotein expressed. The absence of a correlation between steady-state MDR1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein levels was not restricted to K562 cells but was found in other lymphoid cell lines. These findings have implications for the avoidance or reversal of multidrug resistance in the clinic.

These findings have implications for the avoidance or reversal of multidrug resistance in the clinic. multidrug resistance reverse transcription 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate threshold cycle luciferase Epstein-Barr virus MDR1 is the most common impediment to successful chemotherapy for a variety of cancers (1Gottesman M.M. Fojo T. Bates S.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4443) Google Scholar). The most frequent form of drug resistance in relapsed acute leukemia is overexpression of P-glycoprotein (2McKenna S.L. Padua R.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1997; 96: 659-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 3Ivy S.P. Olshefski R.S. Taylor B.J. Patel K.M. Reaman G.H. Blood. 1996; 88: 309-318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). P-glycoprotein is a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of active transporters and functions as an energy-dependent efflux pump that reduces the intracellular concentration of cytotoxic compounds and, hence, their toxicity. P-glycoprotein has a broad substrate specificity and can confer resistance to a wide range of different cytotoxic compounds (4Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar). Most pre-clinical and clinical efforts to overcome MDR aim to modulate P-glycoprotein activity. However, clinical trials of compounds that inhibit P-glycoprotein activity have had limited success and led to adverse pharmacokinetic side effects (1Gottesman M.M. Fojo T. Bates S.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4443) Google Scholar). It may, therefore, be more appropriate to target MDR1 expression. Indeed,MDR1 transcription has been targeted with Ecteinascidin 743 in pre-clinical studies (5Jin S. Gorfajn B. Faircloth G. Scotto K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6775-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and more recently by modulation of the nuclear receptor SXR (6Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Strategies involving antisense and transcriptional decoy (7Marthinet E. Divita G. Bernaud J. Rigal D. Baggetto L.G. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1224-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the use of anti-MDR1 mRNA hammerhead ribozymes have also been suggested (8Wang F.S. Kobayashi H. Liang K.W. Holland J.F. Ohnuma T. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Stresses such as short-term exposure to cytotoxic drugs results in the up-regulation of MDR1 mRNA levels in many cell lines (9Hu Z. Jin S. Scotto K.W. J. Biol.

Clin Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 3352-3356PubMed Google Scholar). This is frequently due to transcriptional activation of the MDR1gene and has been reported in many cell lines after different physical and chemical stimulations and in cells selected for resistance to a variety of cytotoxic drugs (5Jin S. Gorfajn B. Faircloth G. Scotto K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6775-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 9Hu Z. Jin S. Scotto K.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 221-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cell lines selected for drug resistance, increased MDR1 gene expression is also the result of amplification of the MDR1 locus and the appearance of self-replicating episomes (4Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar). Gene rearrangements that constitutively activate MDR1 transcription have also been associated with refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia (17Knutsen T. Mickley L.A. Ried T. Green E.D. du Manoir S. Schrock E. Macville M. Ning Y. Robey R. Polymeropoulos M. Torres R. Fojo T. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998; 23: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Mickley L.A. Spengler B.A. Knutsen T.A. Biedler J.L. Fojo T. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1947-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although regulation due to changes in the MDR1 mRNA stability (19Lee C.H. Bradley G. Ling V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), P-glycoprotein turnover (20Zhang W. Ling V. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), or trafficking (21Meschini S. Calcabrini A. Monti E. Del Bufalo D. Stringaro A. Dolfini E. Arancia G. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 87: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have been suggested, transcriptional regulation is widely considered to be the key step accounting for the complex spatio-temporal pattern of expression in vivo (22van Kalken C. Giaccone G. van der Valk P. Kuiper C.M. Hadisaputro M.M. Bosma S.A. Scheper R.J. Meijer C.J. Pinedo H.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 1063-1072PubMed Google Scholar, 23Nakayama M. Wada M. Harada T. Nagayama J. Kusaba H. Ohshima K. Kozuru M. Komatsu H. Ueda R. Kuwano M. Blood. 1998; 92: 4296-4307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also generally been assumed that up-regulation of MDR1 mRNA leads to an increase in P-glycoprotein. For example, human renal carcinoma (16Chin K.V. Tanaka S. Darlington G. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 221-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rat liver cells (24Schrenk D. Gant T.W. Michalke A. Orzechowski A. Silverman J.A. Battula N. Thorgeirsson S.S. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2541-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) up-regulate both MDR1 mRNA and P-glycoprotein following different stresses and are consequently transiently resistant to vinblastine. In this study, we show that in K562 leukemic cells the levels ofMDR1 mRNA increase in a dose- and time-dependent manner upon transient exposure to a variety of cytotoxic drugs. However, in contrast to the general prevailing models, we show that this is due to stabilization of mRNA and not because of transcriptional activation. Furthermore, the newly stabilized mRNA is not translated and so does not result in expression of P-glycoprotein and drug efflux. Only on subsequent long-term selection for drug resistance does the stabilized mRNA associate with polyribosomes, permitting translation of P-glycoprotein and drug efflux. The finding that drug resistance is a two-step post-transcriptional process, mediated by changes in bothMDR1 mRNA stability and translation, suggests new possibilities for treatment regimes to circumvent MDR in leukemia. K562, CCRF-CEM, and MANN cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine; KB-V1 cells (25Ueda K. Clark D.P. Chen C.J. Roninson I.B. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 505-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 20% fetal calf serum and 110 μmvinblastine (Sigma). All drugs were obtained from Sigma. For transient drug treatments (inductions), exponentially growing cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml and incubated with drug for the indicated times. The drug concentrations used were determined previously to cause macroscopic changes in cell morphology, indicative of cytotoxic stress, such as swelling, and changes in shape and granularity, in greater than 50% of cells. Unless otherwise stated, drug inductions were for 3 days using 3.4 nm doxorubicin, 22 μm vinblastine, 2.5 nm colchicine, 1.34 μm colcemid, or 100 μm cytarabine. Drug-resistant K562 sublines were obtained in a one-step selection by exposure to concentrations of the following cytotoxic drugs, which had been shown to result in 99.9% cell death after 14 days in culture in preliminary experiments: 40 pm colchicine, 30 pm doxorubicin, or 25 μm1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (cytarabine). Lines resistant to these concentrations of drug were designated KC40, KD30, and KA25 lines, respectively. RNA was prepared from cells by RNAzol extraction (Biogenesys, Poole, United Kingdom), reverse-transcribed (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and amplified by PCR. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR estimation of MDR1 mRNA levels was performed as described (26Noonan K.E. Beck C. Holzmayer T.A. Chin J.E. Wunder J.S. Andrulis I.L. Gazdar A.F. Willman C.L. Griffith B. Von and Hoff D.D. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7160-7164Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Real-time quantitative PCR (Taqman; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) used the following primers within the MDR1coding sequence: sense, 5′-TTGTTCAGGTGGCTCTGGAT-3′; antisense, 5′-CTGTAGACAAACGATGAGCTATCACA-3′; and probe, 5′-AGGCCAGAAAAGGTCGGACCACCA-3′. Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix and control amplimers for GAPDH and 18 S ribosomal RNAs were used as recommended by the supplier (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Results were collected and analyzed with an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as follows: the PCR cycle number that generated the first fluorescence signal above a threshold (threshold cycle, CT; 10 standard deviations above the mean fluorescence generated during the baseline cycles) was determined, and a comparative CT method was then used to measure relative gene expression. The following formula was used to calculate the relative amount of the transcript in the sample and normalized to an endogenous reference (GAPDH or 18 S rRNA): 2−ΔΔCT, where ΔCT is the difference in CT between the gene of interest and GAPDH or 18 S rRNA, and ΔΔCT for the sample = ΔCT of the actual sample − ΔCT of the lowest expressing sample. K562, KC40, and KD30 cells were incubated with 12.5 μg/ml actinomycin D to inhibit transcription. This concentration of actinomycin D was determined empirically in a series of pilot experiments as that which inhibited greater than 95% of [3H]uridine incorporation in both the naı̈ve and drug-resistant K562 cell lines, and thus nascent transcription, within 1 h (27Ogretmen B. McCauley M.D. Safa A.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11679-11691Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at different times after actinomycin D addition, and total RNA was isolated as above. Total RNA, or the poly(A)+ fraction isolated by using an Oligotex kit (Qiagen), was used in real-time Taqman RT-PCR assays. In addition, Northern blots (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) of 10 μg of total RNA from the above samples were hybridized with probes derived from gene-specific sequences from the MDR1, GAPDH,Id2, or RAR-α genes (29Ishiguro A. Spirin K.S. Shiohara M. Tobler A. Gombart A.F. Israel M.A. Norton J.D. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1996; 87: 5225-5231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kizaki M. Koeffler H.P. Lin C.W. Miller C.W. Leuk. Res. 1990; 14: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were quantified with a PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences). Genomic DNA was isolated from cells by proteinase K digestion and phenol/chloroform extraction, digested with EcoRI, Southern blotted, and hybridized to nick-translated radioactive probes by standard procedures (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probes were derived from the MDR1 5′-end region (975-bpPstI fragment comprising the transcription start point, 5′-untranslated region, and first intron) (31Ueda K. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17432-17436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the β-globin locus (3.0-kb EcoRI fragment containing DNase I hypersensitive site V) (32Blom van Assendelft G. Hanscombe O. Grosveld F. Greaves D.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 969-977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). β-Globin to MDR1 ratios were obtained by quantitation using a PhosphorImager. Nuclei were prepared from naı̈ve, drug-induced, or drug-resistant K562 sublines as described (27Ogretmen B. McCauley M.D. Safa A.R.

Thurston C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For theMDR1 promoter-luciferase transcriptional assays, K562, KC40, and KD30 cells were transiently transfected with pMDR1(−1202), carrying the luciferase reporter gene from pGL2B (Promega, Madison, WI) under the control of MDR1promoter (34Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), together with pEFlacZ carrying the bacterial β-galactosidase gene under the control of the EF1αpromoter. After 2 days, cells extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was determined with a luciferase assay system (Promega) and normalized against β-galactosidase expression (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The AP-1-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid (pAP1-luc), containing four tandem copies of the TPA-responsive element consensus motif TGACTCA coupled to the −36 to +37 rat prolactin minimal promoter (35Rincon M. Flavell R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), was cotransfected with pEFlacZ into K562 and KD30 cells. When indicated, cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) during the last 12 h, and luciferase and β-galactosidase expression were measured as above. Transfections were by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser (Bio-Rad) with 5 × 106 cells essentially as described (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Analysis of surface P-glycoprotein expression was by flow cytometry using the fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody UIC2 (Immunotech, Marseille, France), essentially as described (36Mechetner E.B. Schott B. Morse B.S. Stein W.D. Druley T. Davis K.A. Tsuruo T. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12908-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), using a Becton Dickinson Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences). Live cells were detected by exclusion of propidium iodide. Drug-induced cells were monitored 1, 2, 3, and 4 days after drug addition. Where indicated, single cells were sorted into 96-well plates after UIC2 staining at a density of one cell per well by a FACS Vantage (BD Biosciences) and clonally expanded. Crude cell membrane fractions were prepared from 1 × 108 cells essentially as described (37Gerlach J.H. Bell D.R. Karakousis C. Slocum H.K. Kartner N. Rustum Y.M. Ling V. Baker R.M. J. Clin. Oncol. 1987; 5: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were lysed with a hypotonic buffer (50 mm mannitol, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA) and centrifuged at a low speed (500 × g) to pellet nuclei and associated membranes such as endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (plasma membrane-depleted fraction). The supernatant from the low speed fractionation was further centrifuged at 100,000 × gto obtain the plasma membrane-enriched fraction. Plasma membrane-enriched and -depleted fractions (200 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred electrophoretically to Immobilon membranes (Millipore, Watford, United Kingdom). Filters were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.1 μg/ml of the anti-P-glycoprotein monoclonal C219 (Cis-Bio International, Gif-Sur-Yvette, France) or 1:1000 anti-Na+/K+-ATPase α2 subunit, clone IID8, (Affinity Bioreagents Inc., Golden, CO) in 5 g/100 ml skimmed milk phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 g/100 ml Tween 20. Protein was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) after incubating with and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat and mouse IgG secondary antibody (1/1000) (Dako, Ely, United Kingdom). Incorporation of [35S]Met in nascent proteins was determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitable counts, following standard procedures (38Bonifacino J.S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Extracts of drug-induced K562, KC40, and MANN cells, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and RNA extraction followed standard procedures (39West M.J. Sullivan N.F. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 2515-2524PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, buffers contained 20 mm EDTA. Isolated RNA was precipitated with 3m LiCl and resuspended in 10 μl of water. Detection ofMDR1 mRNA was by RT-PCR as described above. The myeloid leukemia-derived cell line K562 expresses very low levels of MDR1 mRNA, barely detectable by standard RT-PCR assays (Fig.1 A), although readily determined by a more sensitive method like real-time RT-PCR using poly(A)+ mRNA (data not shown). K562 cells responded to short-term exposure (drug induction) to several different cytotoxic drugs (doxorubicin, colchicine, colcemid, vinblastine, and cytarabine) by up-regulating MDR1 mRNA levels (Fig. 1 A). Real-time RT-PCR showed a 30- to 100-fold increase in MDR1mRNA levels in drug-induced cells compared with naı̈ve (not exposed to drug) K562 cells (data not shown). This effect was due to the cytotoxic drug, because the increase in MDR1 mRNA was both time- and dose-dependent (Fig. 1 B). To generate K562 sublines resistant to low levels of drugs, three cytotoxic drugs with different modes of action were used, colchicine (which binds tubulin and prevents mitosis), doxorubicin (a DNA intercalating agent), and cytarabine (a pyrimidine analogue). A one-step drug selection resulted in the generation of resistant pools of clones (see “Experimental Procedures”). These lines were called KC40, KD30, and KA25 (colchicine-, doxorubicin-, and cytarabine (araC)-resistant, respectively). MDR1 mRNA was substantially up-regulated in each of these lines (Fig. 1 A), shown by real-time RT-PCR to be between 2- and 5-fold greater than the levels found in the 3-day drug-induced cells (data not shown). Thus, both drug induction and selection for drug resistance result in substantial increases in steady-state MDR1 mRNA levels, independent of the mode of action of the drug. Gene amplification is a common mechanism for the up-regulation ofMDR1 mRNA in cell lines (4Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar) and is normally accompanied by rearrangements and deletions in the amplified locus. Genomic DNA from drug-resistant (KC40 and KD30) cells had the same MDR1gene copy number as the parental line K562, thus no detectable amplification or rearrangements of the locus had occurred (Fig.2 A). To determine whether MDR1 mRNA up-regulation was due to transcriptional activation (40Kantharidis P. El-Osta S. Silva M. Lee G. Hu X.F. Zalcberg J. Drug Resist. Updat. 2000; 3: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we used two different approaches. We initially used a gene reporter assay in which an MDR1promoter fragment was placed upstream of the luciferase reporter gene (34Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This reporter plasmid has been used previously to demonstrate transcriptional activation of MDR1 in, among others, human colon carcinoma SW620 cells (34Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Luciferase expression was equivalent in naı̈ve (not drug-treated) and all of the drug-resistant K562 lines (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that there is no promoter up-regulation. As AP-1 plays a role in the transcriptional activation of MDR1 (41Daschner P.J. Ciolino H.P. Plouzek C.A. Yeh G.C. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1999; 53: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and because K562 cells resistant to etoposide (another P-glycoprotein substrate) have up-regulated levels ofc-jun and c-fos mRNAs and increased AP-1 binding activity (42Ritke M.K. Yalowich J.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 2007-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 43Ritke M.K. Bergoltz V.V. Allan W.P. Yalowich J.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), it was necessary to exclude the possibility that the AP-1 pathway had been inactivated in these cells. To do this we used a reporter plasmid, pAP1-luc, in which the luciferase gene expression was driven by four human collagenase TPA-responsive elements and the minimal rat prolactin promoter (35Rincon M. Flavell R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This TPA-responsive element has been used in numerous studies because of its high affinity for the AP-1 complex, and, as expected, transient transfection in Jurkat T-cells results in an increase of luciferase activity upon TPA activation (35Rincon M. Flavell R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which increases MDR1 gene expression in several cell lines, including K562 cells (44Chaudhary P.M. Roninson I.B. Oncol. Res. 1992; 4: 281-290PubMed Google Scholar). Naı̈ve and drug-resistant cells transiently transfected with pAP1-luc produced similar levels of luciferase activity, both before and after TPA activation (Fig. 2 C). Thus, the pathway responsible of activating AP-1 is equally functional in both naı̈ve and drug-resistant K562 cells, and the lack of transcriptional activation of the MDR1 promoter in drug-resistant cells cannot be due to a lack of AP-1 functionality. To confirm that transcriptional activation of the MDR1promoter is not responsible for MDR1 mRNA up-regulation we also studied the MDR1 promoter in its native chromosomal context by nuclear run-on experiments. Despite the increase in steady-state MDR1 mRNA levels, transcription initiated from the MDR1 promoter was low compared with transcription from other control genes (e.g. GAPDH,β-actin, or ε-globin) and did not increase significantly in drug-resistant or drug-induced cells (data not shown). Thus, transcriptional activation does not appear to be responsible for the up-regulation of MDR1 mRNA in K562 cells following drug induction or upon selection for drug resistance. Because the increase in steady-stateMDR1 mRNA was not due to de novo mRNA synthesis, we asked whether changes in the rates of mRNA decay might be involved. To determine the half-lives of MDR1mRNA in naive, drug-induced and drug-resistant cells, we treated cells with actinomycin D to inhibit transcription (see “Experimental Procedures”). MDR1 mRNA from naı̈ve K562 cells had a very short half-life (approximately 1 h) determined by real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, MDR1 mRNA half-life values for doxorubicin- and colchicine-resistant K562 cells were 12–16 h (Fig. 3 A). This was confirmed by Northern analysis (Fig. 3 B) and is in good agreement with the 14-h half-life reported for another independently derived doxorubicin-resistant K562 line (K562/ADR) (45Muller C. Goubin F. Ferrandis E. Cornil-Scharwtz I. Bailly J.D. Bordier C. Benard J. Sikic B.I. Laurent G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 51-56PubMed Google Scholar). Drug-induced K562 cells also had a long MDR1 mRNA half-life (Fig. 3A). The half-lives of other short-lived messages, such as Id2 and RAR-α, were confirmed to be 1–2 h as reported previously (29Ishiguro A. Spirin K.S. Shiohara M. Tobler A. Gombart A.F. Israel M.A. Norton J.D. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1996; 87: 5225-5231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kizaki M. Koeffler H.P. Lin C.W. Miller C.W. Leuk. Res. 1990; 14: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in both naı̈ve and drug-resistant K562 cells (Fig. 3 C). Similarly, the half-life of a long-lived message (GAPDH) was also unchanged in drug-resistant cells (20–24 h in both naı̈ve K562 and KD30 cells) (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the stabilization of theMDR1 mRNA is specific and not a general phenomenon affecting other short-lived mRNAs. In conclusion, up-regulation ofMDR1 mRNA levels following exposure to drugs, after either a transient induction or drug selection, is primarily due to a specific increase in mRNA stability. Transient exposure to cytotoxic drugs (drug induction) led to an increase in MDR1 mRNA levels through mRNA stability. This observation led us to ask whether MDR1mRNA up-regulation was accompanied by an increase in P-glycoprotein expression. Cell surface expression of P-glycoprotein was measured by flow cytometry using the P-glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibody UIC2 (36Mechetner E.B. Schott B. Morse B.S. Stein W.D. Druley T. Davis K.A. Tsuruo T. Roninson I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12908-12913Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). There was no significant increase in UIC2-positive cells following drug induction at any stage during the 4-day incubation period compared with naı̈ve K562 cells. In contrast, cells selected for resistance to the P-glycoprotein substrates colchicine (KC40 cells) or doxorubicin (KD30 cells) showed a large (10- to 100-fold) increase in UIC2 reactivity, indicating the presence of active P-glycoprotein on the cell surface. Cells selected for resistance to cytarabine (KA25 cells), which is not transported by P-glycoprotein, showed much lower levels of surface P-glycoprotein expression than the KC40 and KD30 cells, despite having similarMDR1 mRNA levels. Only 40% of cytarabine-resistant (KA25) cells expressed surface P-glycoprotein, consistent with the fact that resistance to cytarabine is known to be mediated by other P-glycoprotein-independent mechanisms (11Chaudhary P.M. Roninson I.B. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 632-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). Because the assay above detects only active P-glycoprotein in the plasma membrane, it was necessary to exclude the possibility that P-glycoprotein was expressed in drug-induced cells, but either inserted in the plasma membrane in an inactive form or accumulated intracellularly. Cell membranes from naı̈ve, drug-induced, and drug-resistant K562 cells were analyzed for P-glycoprotein expression by immunoblotting using the monoclonal antibody C219. A band of ∼190 kDa, corresponding to mature P-glycoprotein, was detected in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction from drug-resistant lines but not from the naı̈ve or drug-induced cells (Fig. 4 B).

RGS proteins may integrate receptors and signaling pathways by physical or kinetic scaffolding mechanisms. To determine whether this results in enhancement and/or selectivity of agonist signaling, we have prepared C6 cells stably expressing the μ-opioid receptor and either pertussis toxin-insensitive or RGS- and pertussis toxin-insensitive Gαo. We have compared the activation of G protein, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, stimulation of intracellular calcium release, and activation of the ERK1/2 MAPK pathway between cells expressing mutant Gαo that is either RGS-insensitive or RGS-sensitive. The μ-receptor agonist [d-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin and partial agonist morphine were much more potent and/or had an increased maximal effect in inhibiting adenylyl cyclase and in activating MAPK in cells expressing RGS-insensitive Gαo. In contrast, μ-opioid agonist increases in intracellular calcium were less affected. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the GTPase-activating protein activity of RGS proteins provides a control that limits agonist action through effector pathways and may contribute to selectivity of activation of intracellular signaling pathways.

The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the GTPase-activating protein activity of RGS proteins provides a control that limits agonist action through effector pathways and may contribute to selectivity of activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Opioid receptors are a typical seven-transmembrane domain receptor family that signal through inhibitory G proteins to a multitude of second messengers and cellular effectors, including adenylyl cyclase, voltage-operated calcium channels, and inwardly rectifying K+ channels (1Law P.Y. Wong Y.H. Loh H.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 2000; 40: 389-430Google Scholar); intracellular calcium stores (2Smart D. Lambert D.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 264-268Google Scholar); and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; PTX, pertussis toxin; DAMGO, [d-Ala2,MePhe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin; [35S]GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-[35S]thiotriphosphate); GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; dH2O, distilled H2O; AppNHp, adenyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium concentration mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (3Gutstein H.B.

There are three principal types of opioid receptors, μ, δ, and κ, with ∼60% homology. However, the μ-opioid receptor has generated the most interest as the principal site of action for clinical analgesics and abused opiate drugs. The μ-opioid receptor can couple to all members of the Gαi/o family, with little selectivity for particular Gα subunits (5Laugwitz K.-L. Offermans S. Spicher K. Schultz G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 233-242Google Scholar). Selectivity of intracellular μ-opioid signaling would therefore appear to depend on cell-specific expression of G protein subunits coupled with the selectivity of G proteins to interact with particular effectors. However, it has been suggested that other factors besides G protein and effectors may contribute to signaling specificity (6Dohlman H.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2657-2664Google Scholar, 7Blumer J.B. Chandler L.J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15897-15903Google Scholar, 8Neubig R.R. Siderowski D.P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery. 2002; 1: 187-197Google Scholar). Agonist activation of G protein-coupled receptors leads to exchange of GDP for GTP on Gα and dissociation of the Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits. Deactivation is brought about by the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα, causing GTP to be hydrolyzed to GDP and the subsequent reassociation of the Gα-GDP and Gβγ subunits. G protein signaling in this fashion is negatively controlled by a family of proteins known as RGS (regulators of Gprotein signaling) proteins (6Dohlman H.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2657-2664Google Scholar). These proteins act as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) for Gα and speed up the hydrolysis of the Gα-bound GTP, thus reducing the steady-state levels of Gα-GTP and inhibiting signaling. Therefore, it has been suggested that, as with other G protein-coupled receptors, RGS proteins act to inhibit μ-opioid signaling and may play a controlling role in the effectiveness of opioid receptor ligands. In support of this idea, overexpression of RGS2 shifts the concentration effect curve for morphine-stimulated pigment aggregation to the right to a small (2-fold) degree in cultured dermal melanophores from Xenopus laevis transiently expressing a murine μ-opioid receptor (9Potenza M.N. Gold S.J. Roby-Shemkowitz A. Lerner M.R. Nestler E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 482-491Google Scholar). Furthermore, a reduction in RGS9 levels in mice using antisense oligonucleotide leads to an increase in the anti-nociceptive potency of morphine (10Garzon J. Rodriguez-Diaz M. Lopez-Fando A. Sanchez-Blazquez P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 801-811Google Scholar). Although these changes are small, they are suggestive of a role for RGS proteins in opioid coupling efficiency. An important question is whether RGS proteins alter the efficiency of all intracellular signaling pathways equally or whether there is a variable effect that would provide for selectivity. Selectivity for particular pathways may be obtained by several mechanisms. RGS-containing proteins have a wide variety of non-RGS domains (11Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Google Scholar, 12De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 138-144Google Scholar, 13Hepler J.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 376-382Google Scholar) that, when RGS protein binds to Gα, can link other proteins and signaling pathways to provide for diversity of signaling. In addition, the interaction of RGS protein with receptors may contribute to selectivity; for example, RGS12 binds to the carboxyl terminus of the interleukin-8 receptor (14Snow B.E. Antonio L. Suggs S. Gutstein H.B. Siderovski D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 770-777Google Scholar), and inhibition of Ca2+signaling in rat pancreatic acinar cells by RGS4 is selective for muscarinic receptors relative to bombesin and cholecystokinin receptors (15Xu X. Zeng W. Popov S. Berman D.M. Davignon I. Yu K. Yowe D. Offermanns S. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3549-3556Google Scholar) possibly through interaction of the N-terminal domain of RGS4 with the receptors (16Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok P. Danho W. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34690Google Scholar). Recently, Wang et al. (17Wang Q. Liu M. Bashar M. Siderowski D.P. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24949-24958Google Scholar) demonstrated, using ribozyme technology, that RGS3 is a negative modulator of m3 muscarinic receptor signaling, whereas RGS5 is a negative modulator of angiotensin type 1a receptor signaling through Gq/11. In addition to RGS proteins selectively modulating the coupling of different receptors to a single effector, it is possible that RGS proteins could selectively modulate the coupling of a single receptor to different effectors. Indeed, we have recently proposed a “kinetic scaffolding” model for G protein signaling in which RGS proteins confer selectivity for signaling pathways by their ability to shorten the lifetime of Gα-GTP (18). In this model, RGS protein accelerates hydrolysis of the Gα-bound GTP, permitting recombination of Gα-GDP and Gβγ and recoupling of the heterotrimer and receptor and allowing rapid reactivation by agonist-bound receptors. This maintains active Gα-GTP and Gβγ proteins in the close vicinity of the receptor, but spillover of Gα-GTP and Gβγ to more distant effectors is prevented by the GAP activity of RGS. This effect can be mediated by the RGS domain alone and does not depend on other protein interaction modules. Here we test the hypothesis that RGS proteins differentially regulate μ-opioid receptor coupling to signaling pathways, thus contributing to selectivity of receptor activation of second messenger pathways. Because 30 mammalian proteins with RGS activity have been identified to date (12De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 138-144Google Scholar, 13Hepler J.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 376-382Google Scholar), the choice of which RGS protein to study is a difficult one. We have therefore made use of a point mutation in Gαo (G184S) that is known to block interaction with all members of the RGS family without affecting GTPase activity (RGS-insensitive) (19Lan K.-L. Sarvazyan N.A. Taussig R. MacKenzie R.G. DiBello P.R. Dohlman H.G. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12794-12797Google Scholar), together with a mutation (C351G) that confers pertussis toxin (PTX) insensitivity (PTXi) (20Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 1-13Google Scholar). In this way, when the RGS- and PTX-resistant Gαo mutant (GαoRGS/PTXi) is expressed in a cellular system, coupling to endogenously expressed G proteins can be inactivated by PTX treatment, and the system must then signal through the expressed Gαo mutant (21Jeong S.-W. Ikeda S.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4489-4496Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that the μ-opioid agonists DAMGO and morphine showed increased potency and/or efficacy of signaling to adenylyl cyclase in cells expressing RGS-insensitive Gαocompared with those expressing RGS-sensitive Gαo. Signaling through the MAPK pathway also showed an increased potency with the full agonist DAMGO, but not an increased maximal effect, although the maximal effect of the partial agonist morphine was significantly enhanced. In contrast, the ability of DAMGO or morphine to stimulate the release of calcium from intracellular stores was altered to a much lesser extent in cells expressing RGS-insensitive Gαo compared with those expressing RGS-sensitive Gαo. These results confirm that RGS proteins can modulate effector signaling by a single G protein and may play an important role in directing effector responses to μ-opioid receptor signaling.

Clones were maintained under the same conditions and typically subcultured at a ratio of 1:20 to 1:30, with partial replacement of the medium on Day 4 and the day before subculturing or harvesting at Day 7. Cells were treated with or without PTX (100 ng/ml) overnight before collection. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (0.9% NaCl, 0.61 mmNa2HPO4, and 0.38 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4), detached from the plates by incubation in harvesting buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.68 mm EDTA) at room temperature, and pelleted by centrifugation at 200 × g for 3 min. The cell pellet was suspended in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and homogenized with a Tissue Tearor (Biospec Products, Inc.) for 20 s at setting 4. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with a Tissue Tearor for 10 s at setting 2, followed by recentrifugation. The final pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to 0.5–1.0 mg/ml protein and frozen in aliquots at −80 °C. To determine protein concentration, membrane samples were dissolved with 1n NaOH for 30 min at room temperature, neutralized with 1m acetic acid, and assayed by the method of Bradford (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Membrane proteins (20 μg) or His6-Gαo standards (10–40 ng) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels (Protogel, National Diagnostics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (45 μm; Osmonics, Inc., Minnetonka, MN), probed with a 1:200 dilution of anti-Gαo antibody, treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Quantification was done using a Eastman Kodak Image Station 440. Membranes (10–20 μg) were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 0.2–28 nm [3H]DAMGO with or without 50 μm naloxone (to determine nonspecific binding) in a total volume of 0.2 ml for 60 min in a shaking water bath at 25 °C. Samples were filtered through glass-fiber filters (No. 32; Schleicher & Schüll) mounted in a Brandel cell harvester and rinsed three times with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Radioactivity retained on the filters was counted by liquid scintillation counting in 4 ml of EcoLume scintillation mixture (ICN, Aurora, OH). Membranes (14–20 μg) were incubated for 60 min in a shaking water bath at 25 °C with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT; freshly prepared), 30 μm GDP, 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS, and 0.01–10 μm DAMGO, 0.01–10 μm morphine, or dH2O. Samples were filtered through the glass-fiber filters mounted in a Brandel cell harvester and rinsed three times with ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. Radioactivity retained was determined as described above. For kinetic studies, membranes (∼20 μg) were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C in 20 mmHEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, containing 30 μm GDP. DAMGO (10 μm) was added, and the mixture was further incubated for 10 min before the addition of 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS to start the reaction. At various times (3 min to 2 h), bound and free radioactivities were separated and quantified as described above. Membranes (14–20 μg) were prewarmed for 5–20 min at 30 °C with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT (freshly prepared), an ATP-regenerating system (0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mmAppNHp, 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 5 mm phosphocreatine), and 0.01–10 μm DAMGO, 10 μm morphine, or dH2O with or without 1 μm GST-RGS8. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 μm [γ-32P]GTP (prewarmed to 30 °C) to a final volume of 0.1 ml. The reaction was stopped after 15–120 s by the addition of ice-cold 15% charcoal with 20 mm phosphoric acid in 0.1% gelatin. After at least 30 min on ice, samples were centrifuged at 4000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and 0.3 ml was taken from the supernatant for liquid scintillation counting with 4 ml of EcoLume scintillation mixture. Blank values for each time point (without membranes) were subtracted from each value. Cells were plated to confluency in 24-well plates the day before the assay and treated overnight with 100 ng/ml PTX. To start the assay, the cells were rinsed with serum-free medium and then incubated with serum-free medium containing 30 μm forskolin, 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and 0.001–10 μm DAMGO, 0.01–10 μm morphine, or dH2O for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by replacing the medium with ice-cold 3% perchloric acid. After at least 30 min at 4 °C, 0.4 ml was removed from each sample, neutralized with 0.08 ml of 2.5m KHCO3, vortexed, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 min. A radioimmunoassay kit was used to quantify accumulated cAMP in a 10-μl aliquot of the supernatant from each sample. Inhibition of cAMP formation was determined as a percentage of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the absence of opioid agonist. Cells were plated in six-well plates the day before the assay to reach 70–90% confluency on the day of the assay and treated overnight with 100 ng/ml PTX. The medium was replaced with serum-free medium for 2 h before the addition of 0.001–10 μm DAMGO, 10 μm morphine, or dH2O. The assay was stopped after 1–20 min by rinsing the cells twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and adding 0.1 ml of ice-cold SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm DTT, and 0.01% bromphenol blue). Samples were removed from the wells; sonicated for 10–15 s; boiled for 5 min; and then subjected (120 μg) to 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to 45-μm nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting. The blot was probed with a 1:2000 dilution of anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) antibody and visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection and quantification using the Image Station 440. To assure equal loading, membranes were stripped and reblotted with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) antibody to measure total ERK levels. After overnight treatment with 100 ng/ml PTX and 5 μm forskolin, confluent cells were harvested with 10 mm HEPES-buffered 0.9% saline containing 0.05% EDTA, pH 7.4, and washed twice with and then resuspended in Krebs-HEPES buffer of the following composition: 143.3 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 11.7 mmglucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with 10 mNaOH. Cell suspensions were loaded with 3 μmfura-2/acetoxymethyl ester for 30 min at 37 °C, washed, incubated at 20 °C for 20 min, and then rewashed. Intracellular calcium concentrations were measured in 1-ml volumes at 37 °C using a Shimazdu RF5000 spectrofluorophotometer at 340/380 nm excitation and 510 nm emission. In certain experiments, nominally Ca2+-free buffer containing 0.1 mm EGTA was used and was included in the final resuspension only. Data are presented as the Δ340/380 nm ratio (mean ± S.E.). Concentration-effect data from GTPase, [35S]GTPγS binding, adenylyl cyclase, MAPK phosphorylation, and [Ca2+]i assays were fitted to sigmoidal concentration-effect curves using GraphPAD Prism to determine EC50 values and maximal effects. Specific binding data were fitted to a one-site binding hyperbola using GraphPAD Prism to determine K D and B maxvalues. Data are presented as means ± S.E. from at least three separate experiments and are compared using two-tailed Student'st test unless stated otherwise. C6μ cells were stably transfected with GαoPTXi (C6μ-GαoPTXi cells) or GαoRGS/PTXi (C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells). A C6μ-GαoPTXi clone (C1) and a C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi clone (M1) chosen as expressing similar levels of Gαo (Fig.1 A) were used for most studies. In membrane preparations, the binding affinity of [3H]DAMGO in Tris-HCl buffer was similar, with values of 2.0 ± 0.1 nm for C6μ-GαoPTXi cells (clone C1) and 3.5 ± 0.9 nm for C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells (clone M1). TheB max values for [3H]DAMGO were 7.6 ± 1.3 pmol/mg in C6μ-GαoPTXi cells (clone C1) and 14.4 ± 2.0 pmol/mg in C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells (clone M1). PTX treatment (100 ng/ml overnight) of wild-type C6μ cells abolished opioid agonist-mediated signaling, as assessed by inhibition of cAMP accumulation, stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding, stimulation of MAPK phosphorylation, and increases in [Ca2+]i through endogenous G proteins (data not shown). PTX treatment of C6μ cells expressing GαoPTXi or GαoRGS/PTXi allowed signaling through the transfected PTX-resistant Go proteins to be measured. Basal levels of [35S]GTPγS binding were not different in membranes from PTX-treated GαoPTXi-expressing (0.026 ± 0.003 pmol/mg) and GαoRGS/PTXi-expressing (0.031 ± 0.002 pmol/mg) cells. The maximal stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding produced by DAMGO over basal binding in membranes (Fig. 1 B) was lower in C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi membranes (157 ± 26% over control) versus C6μ-GαoPTXi membranes (250 ± 67% over control), but the difference was not statistically significant. A similar pattern was seen for maximal stimulation by morphine (C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi membranes, 48 ± 7% over control; and C6μ-GαoPTXi membranes, 66 ± 17% over control). The potencies of the two μ-agonists for stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding was also the same (DAMGO, EC50 = 296 ± 30 nm in C6μ-GαoPTXi cells and EC50 = 316 ± 30 nm in C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells; and morphine, EC50 = 124 ± 24 nm in C6μ-GαoPTXi cells and EC50 = 159 ± 41 nm in C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells). The rate of stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding by 10 μm DAMGO (Fig. 1 C) was the same in C6μ-GαoPTXi membranes (k = 0.17 ± 0.05 h−1) and C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi membranes (k = 0.17 ± 0.09 h−1). The rates of basal GTP hydrolysis were 10.3 ± 0.3 and 13.2 ± 0.3 pmol/mg/min in membranes from PTX-treated C6μ-GαoPTXi and C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells, respectively. DAMGO stimulated GTP hydrolysis in membranes from both PTX-treated C6μ-GαoPTXi and C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells (Fig. 2 A). The DAMGO stimulation of GTP hydrolysis in C6μ-GαoPTXi cells (5.70 ± 0.50 pmol/mg/min) was greater (p < 0.05) than in C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells (2.64 ± 0.75 pmol/mg/min), consistent with reduced GTPase activity. Furthermore, the addition of 1 μm GST-RGS8 increased the DAMGO stimulation of GTP hydrolysis by a maximal concentration of DAMGO (1 μm) in C6μ-GαoPTXi (but not C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi) membranes, indicating the effectiveness of the RGS-insensitive mutation in preventing the GAP activity of RGS8. GTPase stimulation in C6μ-GαoPTXi membranes by DAMGO at 2 min was concentration-dependent (Fig. 2 B). GST-RGS8 increased the maximal stimulation over basal levels by DAMGO from 60 ± 7 to 151 ± 19% (p < 0.05), with a shift in the EC50 value from 34 ± 12 to 92 ± 31 nm, although this did not reach significance (p = 0.16). The maximal stimulation of GTP hydrolysis by 10 μm morphine at 2 min was 45 ± 5% in the C6μ-GαoPTXi membranes and increased significantly (p < 0.05) to 94 ± 17% in the presence of 1 μm GST-RGS8, although relative to DAMGO, morphine was significantly less efficacious (p< 0.05) in the presence of GST-RGS8 (61 ± 3%) than in its absence (75 ± 1%). RGS8 was chosen for these studies because it is structurally a simpler RGS protein and is known to be a GAP for Gαo (22Lan K.-L. Zhong H. Nanamori M. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33497-33503Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured by the accumulation of cAMP stimulated by forskolin in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine in PTX-treated whole cells. The level of accumulated forskolin-stimulated cAMP was the same in both the GαoPTXi- and GαoRGS/PTXi-expressing cells. The maximal inhibition of cAMP accumulation by DAMGO was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells (58 ± 5% inhibition) than in C6μ-GαoPTXi cells (35 ± 6% inhibition) (Fig.3). More impressive was the fact that DAMGO was ∼35-fold more potent (p < 0.05) in C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells (EC50 = 12 ± 1 nm) than in C6μ-GαoPTXi cells (EC50 = 404 ± 112 nm). Morphine inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3) increased significantly (p < 0.01) from a maximum of 10 ± 5% in C6μ-GαoPTXi cells to 54 ± 7% in C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells and showed an 8-fold increase in potency (C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells, EC50 = 21.7 ± 11.2 nm; and C6μ-GαoPTXi cells, EC50 = 170 ± 53 nm), although this did not quite reach significance at the 0.05 level (p = 0.053). To ensure that the striking difference between the GαoPTXi- and GαoRGS/PTXi-expressing cells was not caused by differences in receptor and Gαo expression levels, inhibition of cAMP accumulation was measured in two additional C6μ-GαoPTXi clones (C2 and C3) and an additional C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi clone (M2). DAMGO and morphine were consistently more potent and gave higher maximal effects in the C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi clones (TableI).Table IInhibition of cAMP accumulation in C6μ-GαoPTXi and C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells by DAMGO and morphine after treatment with PTXCloneDAMGO1-aThe potency and maximal inhibition of AMP accumulation by DAMGO and morphine were measured in different clones expressing GαoPTXi (C1–C3) or GαoRGS/PTXi (M1 and M2) after PTX treatment as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as means ± S.E. from three to four experiments, each performed in duplicate.

DAMGO had somewhat increased potency in the GαoRGS/PTXi-expressing cells compared with the GαoPTXi-expressing cells and the wild-type C6μ cells. Morphine was more potent in the cells expressing GαoRGS/PTXi. When cells were treated with PTX overnight, the effect of DAMGO and morphine was completely lost in the C6μ cells expressing wild-type Gα proteins; however, inhibition of cAMP accumulation was retained in the cells expressing GαoPTXi.Table IIInhibition of cAMP accumulation in wild-type C6μ, C6μ-GαoPTXi, and C6μ-GαoRGS/PTXi cells by DAMGO and morphine without PTX treatmentCloneDAMGO2-aThe potency and maximal inhibition of cAMP accumulation by DAMGO and morphine were measured in wild-type C6μ cells or in C6μ cells expressing GαoPTXi (clone C1) or GαoRGS/PTXi (clone M1) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as means (95% confidence interval) from"
https://openalex.org/W2104323421,"Two fragments of the receptor for glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), each containing the N-terminal domain, were expressed and characterized in either bacterial or mammalian cells. The first fragment, rNT-TM1, included the N-terminal domain and first transmembrane helix and was stably expressed in the membrane of human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The second, 6H-rNT, consisted of only the N-terminal domain of the receptor fused with a polyhistidine tag at its N terminus. The latter fragment was expressed in Escherichia coli in the form of inclusion bodies from which the protein was subsequently purified and refolded in vitro. Although both receptor fragments displayed negligible 125I-labeled GLP-1(7–36)amide-specific binding, they both displayed high affinity for the radiolabeled peptide antagonist125I-exendin-4(9–39). Competition binding studies demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of the GLP-1 receptor maintains high affinity for the agonist exendin-4 as well as the antagonists exendin-4(3–39) and exendin-4(9–39) whereas, in contrast, GLP-1 affinity was greatly reduced. This study shows that although the exendin antagonists are not dependent upon the extracellular loops and transmembrane helices for maintaining their normal high affinity binding, the endogenous agonist GLP-1 requires regions outside of the N-terminal domain. Hence, distinct structural features in exendin-4, between residues 9 and 39, provide additional affinity for the N-terminal domain of the receptor. These data are consistent with a model for the binding of peptide ligands to the GLP-1 receptor in which the central and C-terminal regions of the peptides bind to the N terminus of the receptor, whereas the N-terminal residues of peptide agonists interact with the extracellular loops and transmembrane helices.

Nevertheless, high blood glucose levels are not solely responsible for increased insulin secretion (for review, see Ref. 1Kieffer T.J. Habener J.L. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 876-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, in 1964 McIntyreet al. (2McIntyre N. Holsworth D.C. Turner D.S. Lancet. 1964; 2: 20-21Abstract PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) demonstrated that intravenous injection of glucose resulted in a smaller insulin release than that resulting from intrajejunal glucose injection, even though the latter produced lower blood glucose levels compared with the former. Hence, glucose-dependent insulin secretion requires a nutrient-dependent component, which was believed to be an endocrine transmitter termed an “incretin” (3Creutzfeldt W. Diabetologia. 1979; 16: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). It has since been demonstrated that two hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, are responsible for the incretin effect (1Kieffer T.J. Habener J.L. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 876-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The predominant active form of GLP-1 is actually glucagon-like peptide-1(7–36)amide (termed GLP-11 throughout this paper), a 30-residue peptide hormone derived from the post-translational modification of proglucagon in intestinal L cells (1Kieffer T.J. Habener J.L. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 876-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GLP-1 not only increases glucose-dependent insulin secretion (4Kreymann B. Williams G. Ghatei M.A. Bloom S.R.

Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The physiological roles of GLP-1 in maintaining blood sugar levels, via a glucose-dependent mechanism, have heightened interest in the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) as a target for glucose-dependent therapeutic agents designed to treat hyperglycemia resulting from diabetes (13Gutniak M.

Nature. 2001; 414: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the half-life of GLP-1 itself after subcutaneous injection is very short because of dipeptidyl peptidase IV cleavage of the first 2 N-terminal residues (15Kieffer T.J. McIntosh C.H.S. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and so future research requires the design of physiologically stable GLP- 1R agonists. The venom of the Gila monster Heloderma suspectum contains a mixture of compounds that includes several peptides related in sequence to GLP-1. Two of these, exendin-3 and exendin-4, are 39-amino acid peptides that share ∼50% sequence identity to GLP-1 itself and are indeed potent GLP-1R agonists (Fig. 1) (16Göke R. Fehmann H.C. Linn T.

Interestingly, although GLP-1 affinity is highly sensitive to N-terminal cleavage, exendin-4 can be truncated by up to 8 residues at its N terminus without significant loss of affinity, suggesting that relative to GLP-1, the central and/or C-terminal residues form additional stabilizing contacts with the receptor (15Kieffer T.J.

Nevertheless, the first two amino acids are also essential for the efficacy of exendin peptides because, once removed, the truncated exendin peptides function as antagonists or inverse agonists (16Göke R.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4448-4454Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although the N termini of GLP-1 and exendin-4 are almost identical, exendin-4 contains 9 extra amino acids at the C terminus, which have been shown by NMR analysis to form a compact folding unit termed a “Trp-cage” (20Neidigh J.W. Fesinmeyer R.M. Prickett K.S. Andersen N.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13188-13200Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The NMR analysis also reveals that the central region of exendin-4 is largely helical, whereas the N terminus is rather more disordered (20Neidigh J.W. Fesinmeyer R.M. Prickett K.S. Andersen N.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13188-13200Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although the central region of exendin-4 (comprising residues 10–30) only shares 8 identical residues with GLP-1, they all lie on the same face of an ideal α-helix, suggesting that it is this face of the helix which makes the critical contact with the receptor (21López de Maturana R. Donnelly D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 350: 244-248Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). GLP-1R is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that shares sequence identity with other “Family B” receptors such as those for secretin, glucagon, and vasoactive intestinal peptide (22Thorens B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8641-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Family B GPCRs are characterized by an N-terminal domain of ∼100–150 amino acids containing 6 conserved cysteine residues. The disulfide bonding patterns of these conserved cysteine residues have been determined in three different receptor types and are equivalent, suggesting that this domain forms a related fold in all Family B GPCRs (23Grauschopf U.

The N terminus of Family B GPCRs is clearly a major determinant in ligand binding. The use of both bacterial and mammalian expression systems have yielded soluble N-terminal domains for the corticotropin-releasing factor receptor, which maintain high affinity specific ligand binding (24Hofmann B.A. Sydow S.

In addition, Escherichia coli expression systems have been used to express the isolated N-terminal domains of the receptors for secretin and parathyroid hormone in forms that display functional properties reminiscent of their related wild type receptors (23Grauschopf U. Lilie H. Honold K. Wozny M. Reusch D. Esswein A. Schäfer W. Rücknagel K.P. Rudolph R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8878-8887Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Chow B.K.-C. Recept. Signal Trans. 1997; 7: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar). Although other regions of the receptor are also involved (e.g. 21, 29, 30), GLP-1 clearly also interacts directly with the N-terminal domain of its receptor (26Bazarsuren A. Grauschopf U. Wozny M. Reusch D. Hoffmann E. Schaefer W. Panzner S. Rudolph R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Wilmen A. Göke B. Göke R.

The isolated N-terminal domain of GLP-1R has been expressed in several systems. Wilmen et al. (28Wilmen A. Göke B. Göke R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) expressed the domain from the rat receptor in E. coli and isolated the soluble fraction via nickel affinity chromatography. This group did not report a binding constant for GLP-1, but they were able to demonstrate direct specific binding of GLP-1 to the N terminus via chemical cross-linking. Xiao et al. (29Xiao Q. Jeng W. Wheeler M.B. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) expressed the isolated N-terminal domain of the rat GLP-1R in both mammalian (COS-7) and insect (Sf9) cells and obtained an IC50 for GLP-1 binding of 450 nm, more than 85-fold higher than that observed at the wild type receptor (5.2 nm). Bazarsuren et al. (26Bazarsuren A. Grauschopf U. Wozny M. Reusch D. Hoffmann E. Schaefer W. Panzner S. Rudolph R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) expressed the N-terminal domain of the human GLP-1R in E. coli, but, unlike Wilmen et al. (28Wilmen A. Göke B. Göke R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), they refolded the protein from the insoluble inclusion body fraction. In addition to determining the disulfide bond pattern, Bazarsuren et al. (26Bazarsuren A. Grauschopf U. Wozny M. Reusch D. Hoffmann E. Schaefer W. Panzner S. Rudolph R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) also determined the affinity of GLP-1 for the domain, using either surface plasmon resonance or isothermal titration calorimetry, to be in the region of 46–144 nm. Hence, in all cases it appears that GLP-1 has significantly lower affinity for the isolated N-terminal domain compared with the wild type receptor. However, it has been shown that residues in regions outside of the N-terminal domain of GLP-1 are also important for GLP-1 affinity (29Xiao Q. Jeng W. Wheeler M.B. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,21López de Maturana R. Donnelly D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 350: 244-248Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For example, we recently showed that a mutation close to the first extracellular loop of GLP-1R had a significantly greater effect upon the affinity of GLP-1 than it did for either exendin-4 or exendin-4(9–39) (indeed we have since made several other site-directed mutants in the first two extracellular loops, which display a similar phenotype). 2R. López de Maturana, S. Al-Sabah, and D. Donnelly, unpublished results. Hence, because the affinities of exendin-4 and exendin-4(9–39) are relatively insensitive to mutations in the extracellular loops, we hypothesized that these ligands may bind to the isolated N-terminal domain with an affinity similar to that at the wild type GLP-1R. GLP-1(7–36)amide, exendin-4, exendin-4(3–39), and exendin-4(9–39) were from Bachem (Saffron Walden, UK).125I-GLP-1 (7–36)amide was a gift from Novo Nordisk A/S (Copenhagen, Denmark). 125I-Exendin-4(9–39) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The expression vectors pcDNA3 and pQE-30 were from Invitrogen and Qiagen, respectively. The M15(pREP4)E. coli strain and nickel-nitriloacetic acid resin were purchased from Qiagen. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Sigma. Restriction and modifying enzymes were from MBI Fermentas-Helena Biosciences (Sunderland, UK), Promega (Southampton, UK), Invitrogen (Paisley, Scotland, UK), and New England Biolabs. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen and Sigma. General chemicals were from Merck and Sigma. The cDNA encoding amino acids Met1-Leu171 (N-terminal domain, including the putative signal sequence, and first transmembrane α-helix) of the GLP-1R was synthesized by PCR using as a template the pcDNA3 vector containing the full-length rat GLP-1R gene originally provided in pcDNA1 by Dr. B. Thorens (21López de Maturana R. Donnelly D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 350: 244-248Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Thorens B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8641-8645Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The forward and reverse oligonucleotides incorporated the HindIII andXhoI recognition sites, respectively, to facilitate insertion into the pcDNA3 expression vector. The expressed receptor fragment was named rNT-TM1. For the second construct, the cDNA sequence encoding amino acids Ala13-Leu136(N-terminal domain without the signal sequence) of the GLP-1R was amplified by PCR using the same template as above. The forward and reverse oligonucleotides used in this reaction incorporated theBamHI and HindIII recognition sites, respectively, for subcloning into homologous sites in the pQE-30 expression vector. The resultant construct was identical to that of Wilmen et al. (28Wilmen A. Göke B. Göke R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), taking into account a misprint in the original paper concerning the restriction enzymes used. 3A. Wilmen, personal communication. The expressed protein was named 6H-rNT. The integrity of both constructs was verified by automated nucleotide sequencing. HEK-293 cells were stably transfected with pcDNA3/rNT-TM1 and membrane preparations from these cells prepared as described previously (21López de Maturana R. Donnelly D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 350: 244-248Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Insertion of the cDNA encoding the N-terminal domain of the GLP-1R into the pQE-30 vector led to the addition of 12 extra amino acids at the N terminus of the GLP-1R fragment, including a His6 tag (MRGSHHHHHHGS). Bacterial expression and protein refolding were carried out according to Bazarsuren et al. (26Bazarsuren A. Grauschopf U. Wozny M. Reusch D. Hoffmann E. Schaefer W. Panzner S. Rudolph R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) except that the pulse renaturation stage was carried out manually, and functional characterization of the protein in radioligand binding assays was carried out after the refolding stage but prior to purification via ion exchange chromatography. 75 μl of membranes thawed slowly on ice was diluted appropriately in MBS (20 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mg/liter−1bacitracin) and mixed with 75 μl of 0.2 nm125I-exendin-4(9–39) (50 pm final concentration), 75 μl of MBS and 75 μl of unlabeled peptides at a final concentration ranging from 1·10−6 to 1·10−12m, diluted in MBS. Nonspecific binding was estimated in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled ligand. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound ligand was washed by rapid vacuum filtration (Brandel cell harvester; Gaithersburg, MD) through glass-fiber paper (Whatman GF/G grade filter paper) presoaked in 5% non-fat powdered milk. Filters were rinsed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Then they were cut, allowed to dry, and filter-bound radioactivity was measured in a gamma counter (RiaStar 5405 counter; Packard, Pangbourne, UK). Competition binding assays were set up in a total volume of 300 μl in Eppendorf tubes exactly as described above. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, unbound ligand and soluble receptor were separated by adding 40 μl of nickel-nitriloacetic acid-agarose slurry to each tube, which were mixed and then incubated for 10 min. The ethanol in the resin slurry had been previously taken off and the resin equilibrated in MBS. After this incubation, the resin was pelleted by centrifugation at full speed in a bench top centrifuge for 1 min. The supernatant was pipetted out, and the resin was washed with MBS and pelleted once more. This supernatant was again removed, and the bottom of the Eppendorf tubes were chopped off and placed in appropriate test tubes for counting in the gamma counter. Binding curves in the figures represent one of at least three independent experiments for which each point is the mean of triplicate values with S.E. displayed as error bars. Counts were normalized to the maximal specific binding within each data set. IC50 values were calculated with a single site binding model fitted using nonlinear regression with the aid of the GraphPad PRISM® 3.0 software (San Diego, CA). Values in the tables represent the mean with S.E. calculated from the pIC50 values (−Log IC50) from at least three independent experiments. Assuming that the iodinated peptide had the same affinity as the unlabeled peptide, expression levels were calculated from homologous antagonist binding experiments using Equation 1 (31Akera T. Cheng V.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 470: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) Bmax=B0⋅IC50⋅[L*]−1Equation 1 where B 0 is the specific binding of125I-exendin-4(9–39) and [L*] is the free concentration of 125I-exendin-4(9–39). Although the wild type GLP-1R displayed high affinity for125I-GLP-1, membranes prepared from HEK-293 cells containing rNT-TM1 showed barely detectable binding of the radiolabeled agonist used at 50 pm (data not shown). However, using the antagonist 125I-exendin-4(9–39) as the tracer, again at 50 pm, resulted in high specific binding, which allowed the determination of the IC50 values for various peptides via competition binding. From such binding assays, the IC50values for the antagonists exendin-4(3–39) and exendin-4(9–39) (IC50 = 7.9 and 15.8 nm, respectively) were found to be similar to those obtained with HEK-293 cell membranes expressing the wild type rat GLP-1R, termed rGLP-1R (IC50 = 10.0 and 5.0 nm, respectively; Tables I and II and Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). The agonist exendin-4 also displayed a similar affinity at both receptors (IC50 = 1.6 nm wild type versus 6.3 nmrNT-TM1). However, in marked contrast, the affinity of rNT-TM1 for GLP-1 was estimated to be decreased >50-fold (IC50 = 316 nm versus 6.3 nm at the full-length receptor; Table II and Figs. 3 and 4). The B max value for rNT-TM1 determined from antagonist binding studies suggested that expression levels of this construct were reduced to 10% of rGLP-1R levels (6.8 ± 1.0 pmol·mg−1 versus67.7 ± 12.1 pmol·mg−1).Table IpIC50 values (−Log IC50) from homologous competition binding assays using radiolabeled exendin-4(9–39)rGLP-1RrNT-TM16H-rNT6H-hNT8.3 ± 0.3 (7)7.8 ± 0.1 (3)9.2 ± 0.2 (3)8.5 ± 0.2 (3)The mean ± S.E. is shown.

Radiolabeled exendin-4(9–39) was then used in competition binding studies to determine the binding parameters of the truncated receptor that had been refolded from inclusion bodies. For this part of the study, we used the isolated N-terminal domain from both the rat and human GLP-1Rs. The human N-terminal domain 6H-hNT had already been characterized extensively (26Bazarsuren A. Grauschopf U. Wozny M. Reusch D. Hoffmann E. Schaefer W. Panzner S. Rudolph R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas the rat N-terminal domain 6H-rNT provides a more consistent comparison with the data from rGLP-1 and rNT-TM1. High affinity for exendin-4(9–39) at the isolated N-terminal receptor domain from the human receptor was observed with both the highly purified 6H-hNT preparation and the partially purified 6H-rNT preparation (Table I and Fig. 2). Further analysis demonstrated that 6H-rNT also maintained very high affinity for exendin-4, exendin-4(3–39), and exendin-4(9–39) (IC50 = 1.0, 1.3, and 0.6 nm, respectively). However, in contrast to these exendin peptides, GLP-1 affinity was >60-fold lower than at rGLP-1R (IC50 = 398 nm versus 6.3 nm respectively; Tables I and II and Figs. 2, 3, and5). Because we have shown previously that the binding site for the N-terminal region of the GLP-1 hormone involves the extracellular loop regions (21López de Maturana R. Donnelly D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 350: 244-248Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), it is perhaps not surprising that it has been reported that GLP-1 binds to the isolated N-terminal domain of the GLP-1R with much lower affinity than it does to the wild type receptor (26Bazarsuren A. Grauschopf U. Wozny M. Reusch D. Hoffmann E. Schaefer W. Panzner S. Rudolph R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 28Wilmen A. Göke B. Göke R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Xiao Q. Jeng W. Wheeler M.B. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, because the high affinity of exendin-4 for GLP-1R is neither dependent upon its own N-terminal residues (18Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Yang H. Rodgers B.D. Beday A. Pritchette L.A. Eng J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21201-21206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) nor the loop regions of the receptor (21López de Maturana R. Donnelly D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 350: 244-248Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that it may bind with high affinity to the isolated N terminus of GLP-1R. Such knowledge would provide important information in understanding ligand binding to this receptor, and it may also suggest means by which GLP-1 affinity may be improved by identifying the unique properties of exendin-4. To test this hypothesis, we made two constructs designed to express N-terminal fragments of the rat GLP-1R. The first truncated receptor (rNT-TM1), which included the N-terminal domain and first transmembrane helix of the receptor, was expressed in HEK-293 cell membranes. Because it is membrane-anchored via the single transmembrane helix and is processed by the eukaryotic expression machinery, the resultant binding data can be easily compared with the rat wild type receptor expressed in the same system (rGLP-1R). The second truncated receptor (6H-rNT), consisting of the N-terminal receptor domain fused with a His6 tag, was expressed inE. coli and refolded from inclusion bodies. If correctly refolded in vitro, the data obtained from the analysis of this receptor fragment should be comparable with that obtained for rNT-TM1 because this was refolded by the eukaryotic processing machinery in vivo. However, the soluble protein obtained from E. coli holds additional potential for further structural studies that require greater expression levels and solubility than can easily be obtained for membrane proteins, and hence its characterization is of great interest. The construct and expression system used to synthesize 6H-rNT were identical to those used previously by Wilmen et al. (28Wilmen A. Göke B. Göke R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, they obtained their protein from the soluble faction, whereas we found that the vast majority of the protein expressed in this system was in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies. Although we could increase the yield of soluble protein by lowering the induction temperature, most of the protein was still expressed in the insoluble fraction (data not shown). We therefore denatured and refolded the inclusion body protein according to a method based closely upon that of Bazarsuren et al. (26Bazarsuren A. Grauschopf U. Wozny M. Reusch D. Hoffmann E. Schaefer W. Panzner S. Rudolph R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and analyzed the resultant protein for ligand binding. As a positive control, we analyzed a sample of the refolded human GLP-1R N-terminal domain, which previously had been extensively characterized by CD, cross-linking, affinity chromatography, surface plasmon resonance, and isothermal titration calorimetry (26Bazarsuren A. Grauschopf U. Wozny M. Reusch D. Hoffmann E. Schaefer W. Panzner S. Rudolph R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition to acting as a positive control for the refolding of the rat analog, 6H-rNT, our data (Table I and Fig. 2) further confirm the correct refolding of 6H-hNT itself because we have demonstrated for the first time that it binds exendin-4(9–39) with very high affinity by using a radiolabeled ligand known to be highly selective for the GLP-1R. In competition binding studies using the radiolabeled antagonist peptide exendin-4(9–39), the affinities of the exendin peptides at the truncated rNT-TM1 were determined to be similar to those at rGLP-1R. Hence, there are clearly critical interactions between regions in these peptides and the receptor N terminus. However, GLP-1 displayed an IC50 at the truncated receptor which was more than 50-fold higher than at rGLP-1R (Table IIand Fig. 5). Hence there is clearly a difference between the agonists GLP-1 and exendin-4 because the latter is much less dependent either on regions on the receptor outside of the N-terminal domain of the receptor (Table II and Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) or on its own N-terminal residues (15Kieffer T.J. McIntosh C.H.S. Pederson R.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3585-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 18Montrose-Rafizadeh C. Yang H. Rodgers B.D. Beday A. Pritchette L.A. Eng J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21201-21206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The observation of a >50-fold reduction in affinity at rNT-TM1 highlights the reason why we initially failed to detect GLP-1 affinity using the radiolabeled agonist 125I-GLP-1. Because we used the radiolabeled agonist at 50 pm, the receptor occupancy at this ligand concentration would have been extremely low and, coupled with the reduced B max, the binding would have become undetectable. Nevertheless, it is clear from the competition studies that GLP-1 maintains reasonable affinity for rNT-TM1, albeit 50-fold reduced compared with the wild type receptor. The isolated N-terminal domain of the human GLP-1R has been expressed, refolded, and extensively characterized (26Bazarsuren A. Grauschopf U. Wozny M. Reusch D. Hoffmann E. Schaefer W. Panzner S. Rudolph R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The correct refolding of this domain (6H-hNT) was shown by the binding of GLP-1 using either surface plasmon resonance or isothermal titration calorimetry. However, because the affinity for GLP-1 was found to be significantly lower than that seen at rGLP-1R expressed in mammalian cells, there was the possibility that the domain possessed a structure altered from that of the whole receptor, possibly because of the lack of glycosylation in the bacterial expression system or the in vitro refolding methodology. However, the very high affinity binding for the antagonist exendin-4(9–39) strongly suggests that this domain is correctly refolded and that the loss of GLP-1 affinity is because of the absence of interactions between the GLP-1 and other regions of the receptor. Hence, the determination of the disulfide bonding pattern for 6H-hNT (26Bazarsuren A. Grauschopf U. Wozny M. Reusch D. Hoffmann E. Schaefer W. Panzner S. Rudolph R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) can be viewed with very high confidence. To compare rNT-TM1, our membrane-anchored N-terminal domain for the rat GLP-1R, properly with the refolded N-terminal domain from E. coli, we decided to avoid potential species differences and hence generated a soluble version of the N-terminal domain for the rat GLP-1R. The analysis of this refolded protein confirmed that is was correctly folded because it bound exendin-4(9–39) with very high affinity (<1 nm). It is not clear why this affinity is higher than at rGLP-1R itself; this may result from the different nature of binding assays used or perhaps from an absence of the juxtaposed membrane bilayer in the 6H-rNT preparation. Further analysis also revealed that this protein bound exendin-4 and exendin-4(3–39) with affinity comparable with that observed at rGLP-1R. However, as with the membrane-anchored rNT-TM1, the natural agonist GLP-1 showed very reduced affinity (>60-fold) at the isolated N-terminal domain compared with the full-length receptor. Overall, this part of the study confirmed the results using rNT-TM1 and further reveals the potential for detailed structural studies of this important domain. The isolated N-terminal domain of GLP-1R and other Family B GPCRs has been documented previously to have a reduced affinity for their endogenous ligands. In competition binding studies with agonist tracer, the IC50 for GLP-1 at the soluble rat GLP-1R N terminus purified from COS-7 cells and immobilized on Ni2+ beads was 450 nm (29Xiao Q. Jeng W. Wheeler M.B. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 25: 321-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The refolded N-terminal domain of the human GLP-1R was reported to have aKd of 47 nm, as determined by surface plasmon resonance, and 144 nm from isothermal titration calorimetry (26Bazarsuren A. Grauschopf U. Wozny M. Reusch D. Hoffmann E. Schaefer W. Panzner S. Rudolph R. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 96: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Hence our data using GLP-1 are consistent with these previous observations in showing that normal GLP-1 affinity requires regions outside of the N- terminal domain. The results obtained with rNT-TM1 are somewhat similar to those obtained using the membrane-anchored N-terminal fragment of the rat receptor for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide subtype 1 expressed in COS-7 cells, where a 19-fold reduction in agonist affinity was observed at this similarly truncated receptor (32Cao Y.-J. Gimpl G. Fahrenholz F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The results are also very similar to the analogous corticotropin-releasing factor receptor fragment expressed in COSM6 cells, which showed no detectable binding in homologous competition binding assays when the agonist urocortin was used as tracer but bound with low nm affinity to the antagonist astressin when this peptide was used as the tracer in competition binding studies (33Perrin M.H. Sutton S. Bain D.L. Berggren W.T. Vale W.W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 566-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Comparison of our 6H-rNT data with a study on the N-terminal domain of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 may also be useful because several similarities can be observed (25Perrin M.H. Fischer W.H. Kunitake K.S. Craig A.G. Kerber S.C. Cervini L.A. Rivier J.E. Groppe J.C. Greenwald J. Nielsen S.M. Vale W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31528-31534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This domain was produced as a soluble protein in E. coli and characterized using a radiolabeled peptide antagonist for corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1, astressin. The Ki value for astressin at this receptor fragment was 50 nm compared with 1.8 nm for the full-length receptor in mammalian cells. Interestingly, one agonist (urocortin) was able to displace125I-astressin binding, although with a slightly reduced affinity, whereas two other agonists (corticotropin-releasing factor and sauvagine) were not able to compete for 125I-astressin binding. This example illustrates how agonists with a relatively high degree of sequence identity may have different binding modes on the same receptor. In general, studies focused on the N terminus of Family B GPCRs report very variable decreases in hormone affinity ranging between 20- and 1,000-fold (23Grauschopf U. Lilie H. Honold K. Wozny M.

Recept. Signal Trans. 1997; 7: 143-150PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wilmen A. Göke B. Göke R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 43-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reports on similar rNT-TM1 constructs showing membrane presence but no detectable binding to their cognate hormones also exist (34Unson C.G. Cypess A.M. Kim H.N. Goldsmith P.K. Carruthers C.J.L.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 750-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the GLP-1 binding requirements, the present analysis shows that the exendin antagonists do not require binding epitopes outside the N-terminal domain. This was first indicated after the analysis of site-directed mutations in the extracellular loops of GLP-1R, which reduced GLP-1 affinity but did not markedly reduce exendin-4(9–39) affinity, indicating that this peptide does not need intact loops for high affinity binding to GLP-1R (21López de Maturana R. Donnelly D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 350: 244-248Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar).2 Because the normal affinity of exendin antagonists only requires interactions with the N-terminal domain of the receptor, it strongly suggests that the region between residues 9 and 39 interacts with the N terminus. The equivalent region in GLP-1 (residues 15–30) most likely also binds to this region because both peptides share a conserved face on the putative helix formed by this region (21López de Maturana R. Donnelly D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 350: 244-248Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, there are clearly additional interactions made by residues between positions 9 and 39 of exendins, compared with residues 15–30 of GLP-1, which result in the increased affinity of exendins for the N-terminal domain of the receptor and also reduce the sensitivity of exendin ligands to N-terminal truncation. Hence, the fact that exendin-4 binding does not depend greatly on the extracellular loops does not necessitate that it requires an activation pocket different from that of GLP-1. The increased affinity of exendin-4 and the GLP-1R N terminus may be provided by the C-terminal Trp-cage motif (20Neidigh J.W. Fesinmeyer R.M. Prickett K.S. Andersen N.H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13188-13200Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) or perhaps by the increased helicity of the middle region of this peptide compared with GLP-1 (36Andersen N.H. Brodsky Y. Neidigh J.W. Prickett K.S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002; 10: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 37Chang X.Q. Keller D. Bjorn S. Led J.J. Magn. Reson. Chem. 2001; 39: 477-483Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Increasing peptide helicity has been proposed to improve binding to the N-terminal domain of the calcitonin receptor (38Stroop S.

The C-terminal region of MKP7, homologous to that of M3/6 but not other DSPs, is required for interaction with JIP-1. When MKP7 is bound to JIP-1 it reduces JNK activation leading to reduced phosphorylation of the JNK target c-Jun.

Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). In particular, JNK mediates the cellular response to stress signals (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). Similar to other MAP kinases, JNK is activated by phosphorylation by a signaling module that consists of a MAP kinase kinase (MKK) and a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MKKK) (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). Components of JNK-signaling modules include the MKKs MKK4 and MKK7, together with many types of MKKKs including MEKKs, MLKs, and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). Once activated, JNK phosphorylates and regulates the activity of a number of transcription factors including the activator-protein 1 family members c-Jun and activating transcription factor 2 (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). MAPK activity is also regulated by protein phosphatases (2Keyse S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells JNK phosphatase activity is required to counteract the basal level of MKK4 and MKK7 activity and suppress JNK activation, whereas following cell stimulation JNK phosphatases can down-regulate JNK activity to basal levels (3Cavigelli M.

The physiological functions of these interactions with JIP-1 remain to be elucidated. Genetic studies indicate a role for JIP-1 in neuronal apoptosis.

Karin (University of California, San Diego). Residues 345–665 of MKP7 were expressed from the vector pET28 in the bacterial strain BL21 (DE3). Cell extracts were prepared in 50 mmTris, pH 8.8, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 8 m urea, and 100 mm NaH2PO4. The MKP7 fragment was bound to Ni-agarose (Quiagen) then eluted in 10 mm Tris, pH 4.5, 6 m urea, and 100 mmNaH2PO4. The final pH was adjusted to pH 7.0, and a rat was immunized at three weekly intervals. The first immunization of 50 μg of MKP7 and Complete Freund's Adjuvant was via the Peyers Patches after surgical exposure. The second immunization was also with 50 μg of MKP7 into the Peyers Patches but Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant was used. The third immunization was done intraperitoneally with 80 μg of MKP7 mixed with Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant. The final immunization was again via the Peyers Patches with 50 μg of MKP7 and Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant. 3 days later the rat serum was collected and used unpurified at a dilution of 1/2000 for immunoblotting or 1/500 for immunoprecipitation. 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. ND7 and N1E-115 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 and 293T cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 293T cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline then lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 5 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After incubation on ice for 10 min, extracts were centrifuged at 14000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were recovered and combined with an appropriate volume of gel loading buffer (final concentration 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mmdithiothreitol, 4% glycerol) or subject to pull down or immunoprecipitation as described below. Samples were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electro-transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-T7 tag antibody (Novagen), anti-Xpress (Invitrogen), anti-JNK (d-2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-M3/6 polyclonal (also used to detect GST) (5Palacios C. Collins M.K. Perkins G.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1439-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), or anti-MKP7 polyclonal and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (SeraLab). Blots were developed using ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation or pull down experiments, extracts were made as above and incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) for GST-containing constructs, or with 1 μl of anti-MKP7 polyclonal antiserum or anti-T7 tag antibody with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 3 h. Beads were washed three times in lysis buffer and resuspended in an appropriate volume of gel loading buffer. ND7 and N1E-115 cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer (TLB) containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrrophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mmsodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin. Lysis was performed on ice for 30 min and following centrifugation (14,000 × g for 20 min), cleared lysates were incubated with anti-MKP7 or anti-M3/6 sera and protein G- or A-Sepharose beads, respectively, overnight at 4 °C. Washing, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting were performed as described above, and the blots were probed with anti-JIP-1 monoclonal antibody (22Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were harvested in TLB, and following SDS-PAGE and electro-transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, blots were probed with anti-HA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), T7 tag, or anti-phospho-JNK (Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies. For experiments to determine c-Jun phosphorylation levels, COS-7 cells were lysed directly into gel loading buffer, and blots probed with anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-73) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). N1E-115 cells were grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-ornithine (Sigma). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), and lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed by incubation with monoclonal JIP-1 or polyclonal MKP7 antibodies in 3% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. The appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated and Texas-Red-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (Jasckson Immunoresearch). Nuclei were detected with DAPI (Molecular Probes). Images were prepared using a Zeiss Axioplan-2 conventional fluorescence microscope. Sub-populations of JNK bind to scaffold proteins, therefore we asked whether distinct phosphatases regulate these distinct pools of JNK. MKP7 and M3/6 are DSPs that preferentially target JNK compared with other MAPKs (7Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

We examined whether these DSPs could associate with the JIP family of scaffold proteins to regulate JNK activity. We co-expressed epitope-tagged JIP-1, JIP-2, and JIP-3 with either MKP7 or M3/6 and examined JIP precipitates for the presence of the DSPs using appropriate polyclonal antibodies. JIP-1 and JIP-2, but not JIP-3, associated with MKP7 (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 6, 9, and 12) and M3/6 (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 2, 4, and6), suggesting that these phosphatases interact with a specific subset of JNK scaffold proteins. To determine whether the JIP proteins selectively interacted with MKP7 and M3/6 compared with other DSPs, we co-expressed GST-tagged JIP-1 and epitope-tagged versions of the DSPs in cells. Co-precipitation analysis demonstrated that MKP7 was detected in JIP-1 precipitates (Fig. 1 C, lane 8). In contrast we detected no interaction with the DSPs MKP2, MKP4, and PAC1 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 2, 4, and6) or with MKP1 and MKP5. 2E. A. Willoughby, G. R. Perkins, M. K. Collins, and A. J. Whitmarsh, unpublished results. Our data therefore show that JIP-1 binds to a restricted set of DSPs including MKP7 and M3/6. JIP-1 is strongly expressed in neuronal cells (26Verhey K.J. Meyer D.

Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9002-39011Google Scholar). Using appropriate antibodies, we sought to establish whether endogenous complexes of JIP-1 and MKP7 or M3/6 are present in neuronal cells. Antisera against M3/6 (5Palacios C. Collins M.K. Perkins G.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1439-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and a JIP-1 monoclonal antibody (22Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) have been described previously. We generated polyclonal antisera against MKP7, which recognized exogenously expressed T7-tagged MKP7 on immunoblots of total COS-7 cell extracts (Fig.2 A) and recognized an endogenous protein corresponding to the size of MKP7 in extracts of the neuronal cell line N1E-115 (Fig. 2 B). The MKP7 antiserum also immunoprecipitated the T7-tagged MKP7 from COS-7 extracts (Fig.2 A), indicating its suitability for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. We performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis using the MKP7 and M3/6 antisera, and we detected endogenous JIP-1 in both MKP7 and M3/6 precipitates from extracts of the neuronal cell lines ND7 and N1E-115, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). These data indicate that endogenously expressed JIP-1 can associate with MKP7 and M3/6. Previously, JIP-1 has been demonstrated to reside in the cytoplasm of N1E-115 cells and to be concentrated at the tips of the neurites (29Meyer D. Liu A. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35113-35118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Both exogenously expressed and endogenous MKP7 have been reported to be cytoplasmic (10Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Maeda R. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26629-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6999-7009Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), although there is evidence that it is a nuclear shuttle protein (11Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9002-39011Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether JIP-1 and MKP7 co-localized in N1E-115 cells. As shown in Fig.2 E, JIP-1 immunostaining is present in the cell bodies and is also concentrated at the tips of neurites as previously described (29Meyer D. Liu A. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35113-35118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). MKP7 staining is present in the cell bodies but does not appear to be concentrated at the tips of the neurites (Fig. 2 E). We did not detect JIP-1 or MKP7 immunostaining in the nuclei (Fig.2 E). Dual-labeling experiments indicate that JIP-1 and MKP-7 co-localize in the cell bodies, but only JIP-1 staining is present in the neurite tips (Fig. 2 F). The patterns of JIP-1 and MKP7 localization in N1E-115 cells are therefore distinct but overlapping. Taken together with the immunoprecipitation data, the results suggest that only a proportion of JIP-1 is in a complex with MKP7 and M3/6 in resting neuronal cells. It has previously been demonstrated that immunoprecipitates of over-expressed MKP7 (10Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Maeda R. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26629-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9002-39011Google Scholar) and M3/6 (5Palacios C. Collins M.K. Perkins G.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1439-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) contain JNK and that JIP-1 can directly bind to JNK (19Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 21Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The formation of complexes between JIP-1 and MKP7 or M3/6 might therefore be mediated by an interaction of the phosphatase with JNK. To examine this question, co-immunoprecipitation analysis was used to determine the ability of MKP7 and M3/6 to bind to a JIP-1 mutant with a deletion in the JNK binding domain (JIP-1 ΔJBD) (Fig.3, A and B). MKP7, but not JNK, bound to JIP-1 ΔJBD, indicating that MKP7 can bind to JIP-1 independently of JNK (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). Similar results were obtained for M3/6 binding to JIP-1 ΔJBD.2 We further demonstrated that MKP7 could not bind to the N-terminal region of JIP-1 that includes the JNK binding domain (residues 1–282) but did bind to a C-terminal fragment of JIP-1 (residues 282–707) that does not associate with JNK (Fig.3 B, lanes 4 and 5). Very weak binding of a shorter C-terminal fragment of JIP-1 (amino acids 471–707) to MKP7 was also detected (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). These results indicate that C-terminal regions of JIP-1 are required for binding MKP7 and that MKP7 forms a stable interaction with JIP-1 in the absence of JNK binding. However, it does not rule out the possibility that interactions between MKP7 and JNK may help to stabilize MKP7 binding to JIP-1. We next sought to identify the region of MKP7 that mediates its binding to JIP-1. We performed co-precipitation analysis of MKP7 deletion mutants with JIP-1 (Fig. 3, C and D). An MKP7 deletion mutant containing amino acids 1–394 did not bind to JIP-1, whereas a mutant containing amino acids 1–443 did bind JIP-1, albeit more weakly than full-length MKP7 (Fig. 3 D, comparelanes 1, 5, and 7). These experiments identify the sequence between amino acids 394 and 443 as important for binding. There was increased binding to JIP-1 of an MKP7 mutant containing amino acids 1–552 (Fig. 3 D, lane 11), indicating that additional sequences within the C terminus also contribute to binding. The C terminus of MKP7 is homologous to that of M3/6 but not to other DSPs, which probably explains the selective binding of MKP7 and M3/6 by JIP-1. The binding of JIP-1 to the C-terminal region of MKP7 is distinct from the JNK-binding region located in the N terminus of MKP7 (10Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Maeda R. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26629-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), providing additional evidence that MKP7 binding to JIP-1 is independent of JNK binding. Interestingly, an MKP7 mutant lacking the extended C terminus, and therefore unable to bind JIP-1, is significantly more active against JNK in co-expression studies than wild-type MKP7.2 This suggests that the C terminus of MKP7 may perform a regulatory function, and this in part may be mediated by binding to regulatory proteins such as JIP-1. JIP-1 binds to JNK, MKK7, and MLKs resulting in enhanced activation of JNK (21Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the possibility that the interaction of MKP7 with JIP-1 would enhance the ability of this phosphatase to dephosphorylate the pool of JNK associated with the JIP-1 scaffold. As previously demonstrated, co-expression of full-length JIP-1 with MLK3 and JNK significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of JNK by MLK3 (Fig.4 A, compare lanes 5and 8). The expression of MKP7 at a level that did not block JNK activation by MLK3 in the absence of JIP-1 was nevertheless able to completely block the ability of JIP-1 to enhance JNK activation by MLK3 (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 6 and 9). This effect of MKP-7 depended upon its phosphatase activity. A catalytically inactive mutant of MKP7 (MKP7 C/S) that still binds JIP-1 did not block the JIP-1-mediated enhancement of JNK activation (Fig.4 A, lane 10). These data demonstrate that the ability of MKP7 to dephosphorylate JNK is greatly enhanced by the JIP-1 scaffold protein. One of the major targets of the JNK-signaling pathway is the transcription factor c-Jun (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). JNK phosphorylates c-Jun at Ser-63 and Ser-73 leading to an increase in its transcriptional activity (1Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3633) Google Scholar). Previous genetic studies (32Whitmarsh A.J. Kuan C.Y. Kennedy N.J. Kelkar N. Haydar T.F. Mordes J.P. Appel M. Rossini A.A. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Rakic P. Davis R.J. Genes. Dev. 2001; 15: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) have indicated that JIP-1-signaling complexes are involved in transducing JNK signaling to the c-Jun transcription factor. We therefore determined the effect of MKP7 on the ability of JIP-1 to enhance JNK-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation. Co-expression of JIP-1 with MLK3, JNK, and c-Jun significantly enhanced c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 3and 5). The expression of MKP7 impairs the ability of JIP-1 to enhance JNK-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 5 and 6). Taken together, these results provide evidence that MKP7 can be recruited to the JIP-1 complex to down-regulate JNK signaling, leading to reduced phosphorylation of the JNK target c-Jun. A number of scaffold proteins that regulate the activities of MAPK pathways have recently been characterized (17Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 481-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 18Burack W.R. Shaw A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Our data provides the first evidence that MAPK scaffold proteins can recruit protein phosphatases to modulate MAPK activity. The JIP group of scaffold proteins regulates the activity of the JNK MAPK-signaling pathway by binding to the MLK-MKK7-JNK-signaling module (21Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 22Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 23Kelkar N. Gupta S. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1030-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the JIP family proteins JIP-1 and JIP-2 also selectively associate with the DSPs M3/6 and MKP-7 (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3), and this can lead to the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK and reduced phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 4). Our results suggest a model whereby MKP7 and M3/6 are recruited to JIP scaffold proteins to dephosphorylate and inactivate JNK. However, the precise mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. One possibility is that these DSPs act to continually suppress the activation of JNK through the JIP-1 scaffold protein. This raises the possibility that inhibition of phosphatase action, either by inhibition of enzymatic activity or disruption of the interaction of the phosphatase with JIP-1, could contribute to the activation of JNK by JIP-1. Alternatively, phosphatase activity could be required at some specific point in the cycle of JIP-1 function. For example, the phosphatase may act to suppress inappropriate JNK activation, either by particular stimuli or at particular cell locations. The fact that in resting neuronal cells only a fraction of endogenous JIP-1 forms a stable complex with MKP7 and M3/6 (Fig. 2, C and D) suggests that the recruitment of the DSPs may not be a general mechanism for keeping JIP-mediated JNK signaling repressed in the absence of signal. This is supported by co-localization studies that demonstrate that the patterns of JIP-1 and MKP7 immunostaining in N1E-115 cells are overlapping but also distinct (Fig. 2, Eand F). It is possible therefore that DSPs are recruited to JIP proteins at a particular cell location (e.g. in the cytoplasm of the cell body) or following stimulation of cells. Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that JIP-1 binding to MKP7 is not affected by oxidative stress,2 but future studies will be aimed at determining whether this interaction can be regulated either positively or negatively by other signals. In the future it will be of interest to determine whether other regulators of MAPK pathways recruit specific protein phosphatases to down-regulate these pathways. It seems likely that the targeting of DSPs to specific JNK-signaling modules may be a common theme. Recently a novel DSP, SAPK pathway-regulating phosphatase 1, was described, which when over-expressed can bind to MKK7 and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, potentially acting as a type of scaffold protein itself (35Zama T. Aoki R. Kamimoto T. Inoue K. Ikeda Y. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 16: 23909-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Zama T. Aoki R. Kamimoto T. Inoue K. Ikeda Y. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 16: 23919-23926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Expression of SAPK pathway-regulating phosphatase 1 specifically blocked JNK activation by tumor necrosis factor-α (tumor necrosis factor-α), indicating that the formation of this complex may have a distinct function in cells (35Zama T. Aoki R. Kamimoto T. Inoue K. Ikeda Y. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 16: 23909-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Zama T. Aoki R. Kamimoto T. Inoue K. Ikeda Y. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 16: 23919-23926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although the binding of protein phosphatases to regulators of MAPK-signaling pathways is a novel finding, there are precedents from other signaling systems for the recruitment of protein kinases and protein phosphatases to the same regulatory protein. For example, some members of the protein kinase A anchoring protein (AKAP) family of cAMP-dependent protein kinase-binding proteins also associate with protein phosphatases, thereby co-localizing both positive and negative regulators of a common substrate at distinct locations in cells (37Carlisle Michel J.J. Scott J.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Such recruitment of positive and negative regulators of signaling pathways by scaffolding or anchoring proteins may therefore be a common mechanism for achieving signaling specificity in cells and permitting the rapid modulation of the activities of target proteins by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

It is not known how these mutations might arise. One hypothesis is that UV-induced mutations occur only after deamination of the cytosine or 5-methylcytosine within the pyrimidine dimer. It is not clear how methylation of cytosines at the 5-position influences deamination and how this affects mutagenesis. We have now conducted experiments with a CpG-methylated supF shuttle vector that was irradiated with UVB and then incubated at 37 °C to allow time for deamination before passage through a human cell line to establish mutations. This led to a significantly increased frequency of CC → TT mutations and of transition mutations at 5′-PymCG-3′ sequences. A spectrum of deaminated cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in the supF gene was determined using the mismatch glycosylase activities of MBD4 protein in combination with ligation-mediated PCR. Methylation at the C-5 position promoted the deamination of cytosines within cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and these two events combined led to a significantly increased frequency of UVB-induced transition mutations at 5′-PymCG-3′ sequences. Under these conditions, the majority of all supFmutations were transition mutations at 5′-PymCG-3′, and they clustered at several mutational hot spots. Exactly these types of mutations are frequently observed in the p53 gene of nonmelanoma skin tumors.

Woodhead A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6666-6670Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). The CPD is considered the most important UV-induced lesion based on its relatively high abundance, slow repair, and known mutagenicity (8Sage E. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 57: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 9Pfeifer G.P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 65: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 10Yoon J.-H. Lee C.-S.

In an attempt to dissect the individual contributions of CPDs and (6-4)-photoproducts to UVB mutagenesis, we have previously introduced foreign photolyase genes into a mouse cell line that carries two transgenic mutation reporter genes. We studied the mutations produced after photoproduct-specific photoreactivation and showed that the CPD is responsible for a great majority of the mutations induced by UVB irradiation (11You Y.H.

Earlier, we and others found that sequences that contain 5-methylcytosine within a dipyrimidine are up to 15 times more susceptible to CPD formation after exposure to natural sunlight (12Tommasi S. Denissenko M.F. Pfeifer G.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4727-4730PubMed Google Scholar) or a UVB light source (13Drouin R. Therrien J.-P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 66: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) compared with 254-nm UVC irradiation. Methylation of cytosine enhances CPD formation by sunlight by 5–15-fold (12Tommasi S. Denissenko M.F. Pfeifer G.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4727-4730PubMed Google Scholar). This difference may be explained by the higher energy absorption of 5-methylcytosine compared with cytosine in DNA in the UVB range at wavelengths between 295 and 320 nm (12Tommasi S. Denissenko M.F. Pfeifer G.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4727-4730PubMed Google Scholar, 14Pfeifer G.P. Tang M. Denissenko M.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 249: 1-19PubMed Google Scholar). In previous work, we have examined UV-induced mutational events at methylated CpG sequences using the lacI and cII transgenes as a mutational target. Dipyrimidines that contain 5-methylcytosine were preferential targets for sunlight-induced mutation hot spots (15You Y.-H. Li C. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar,16You Y.H. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Plasmid constructs containing defined UV photoproducts have been used to study the mutagenic specificities of CPDs and (6-4)-photoproducts. The mutation frequency obtained with site-specific 5′-TT-CPDs is generally very low (17Banerjee S.K. Christensen R.B. Lawrence C.W. LeClerc J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8141-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 18Taylor J.-S. O'Day C.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1624-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 19Gentil A. Le Page F. Margot A. Lawrence C.W. Borden A. Sarasin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1837-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the infrequent recovery of mutations at 5′-TT sequences in UV-irradiated cells and is probably due to the action of DNA polymerase η, which correctly bypasses these lesions (20Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 21Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase η is encoded by the RAD30 gene in yeast and by the XPVgene in humans. The mutagenicity of a site-specific CPD containing the 5′-TC sequence also is very low, with >95% accurate lesion bypass, but this has been studied only in Escherichia coli (22Horsfall M.J. Borden A. Lawrence C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2835-2839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with yeast mutants indicate that RAD30 may correctly bypass 5′-T-C and 5′-C-C dimers (23Yu S.L. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). If cytosine-containing CPDs are indeed bypassed mostly error-free, then what is the origin of C → T mutations at such lesions? Spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosines is commonly proposed as the mutational mechanism responsible for C to T transition mutations at CpG sites in mammalian genes (14Pfeifer G.P. Tang M. Denissenko M.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 249: 1-19PubMed Google Scholar, 24Rideout III, W.M. Coetzee G.A. Olumi A.F. Jones P.A. Science. 1990; 249: 1288-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 25Ehrlich M. Zhang X.-Y. Inamdar N.M. Mutat. Res. 1990; 238: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine is expected to occur more rapidly within a CPD as opposed to within normal double-stranded DNA (26Douki T. Cadet J. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1992; 15: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Lemaire D.G. Ruzsicska B.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This process may play an important role in UV mutagenesis. We have shown previously that the deamination of cytosine within CPDs does occur in human cells at a significant rate (28Tu Y. Dammann R. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 297-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here we have studied the mutagenic consequences that are associated with such deamination events, in particular with respect to the involvement of 5-methylcytosine. SV-40-transformed DNA repair-deficient human XP-A fibroblasts (XP12BE) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. The pSP189 plasmid (including a randomly generated 8-base pair signature sequence at the 3′-end of the supF gene) was kindly provided by Michael Seidman (29Canella K.A. Seidman M.M. Mutat. Res. 2000; 450: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The E. coli tyrosine amber suppressor transfer RNA gene, supF, enables read-through of a UAG stop codon in the lacZ gene, resulting in synthesis of functional β-galactosidase. The bacterial strain MBM7070 is cultured on agar containing ampicillin and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, an inducer of β-galactosidase, and X-gal as a color indicator. Colonies resulting from transformation with a functional supF gene will be blue, whereas those containing mutant supF genes will be white. The pSP189 plasmid was methylated in vitro using the CpG-specific DNA methylaseSssI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Control DNA was mock-methylated in the absence of S-adenosylmethionine. Completion of methylation was confirmed by digestion of an aliquot of the reaction mixture with the methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HpaII. Methylated and unmethylated pSP189 were irradiated in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) with a UVB source (a Philips TL 20W/12RS lamp filtered through cellulose acetate; peak emission, 312 nm; lower wavelength cut-off, 295–300 nm) at a dose of 8000 J/m2 (about 10 min). The UV dose was determined with a UVX radiometer and a UVB sensor (Ultraviolet Products, Upland, CA). After UVB exposure, DNA was incubated in TE buffer, pH 7.5, at 37 °C for various time intervals to allow deamination to occur. The pSP189 shuttle vectors were transfected into cultures of nucleotide excision repair-deficient human fibroblasts (XP12BE). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were plated into 10-cm tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Following a 16-h incubation of the cells, a mixture of plasmid and FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added. After a 72-h incubation of the cells, the plasmid was rescued from the human cells by alkaline lysis. Cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in suspension buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml RNase A), mixed with 1 volume of lysis buffer (0.2 m NaOH, 1% (w/v) SDS), and incubated on ice for 3–5 min, followed by the addition of neutralization buffer (3 m potassium acetate, pH 5.5). After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatant was extracted once with phenol/chloroform. Following ethanol precipitation, the DNA was resuspended in DpnI reaction buffer, and unreplicated plasmid was removed by digestion withDpnI, which recognizes the bacterial adenine methylation pattern. Then the plasmid was electroporated into MBM7070 bacteria, which carry a lacZ gene with an amber mutation (29Canella K.A. Seidman M.M. Mutat. Res. 2000; 450: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 30Hauser J. Seidman M.M. Sidur K. Dixon K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The transformed bacteria were diluted in 1 ml of SOC medium and plated on agar plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 1 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 100 μg/ml X-Gal. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, wild-type (blue) and mutant (white) colonies were counted to determine the mutant frequency. Colonies containing a plasmid with a mutatedsupF gene were identified, and the plasmids were purified using Wizard plasmid purification kits (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. It is unlikely that any significant number of the mutations will arise in E. coli. DpnI treatment removes the unreplicated and still lesion-containing plasmids. It should be noted that the replication of the SV40-based plasmid in human cells is of the runaway type, and there will be an enormous dilution of the adducted plasmids. Tens of thousands of progeny molecules are recovered from a single cell. The plasmid replication cycle is about 15–20 min. Even if there are a few single cycle progeny, they will be diluted by a huge excess of nonadducted progeny. In addition, no mutations can be recovered upon direct transformation of MBM7070 with UV-treated plasmids (30Hauser J. Seidman M.M. Sidur K. Dixon K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) because of the high repair capacity of this strain. 2M. Seidman, personal communication. For measuring deamination of cytosines or 5-methylcytosines within cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, a sample of the treated plasmids was used to map deamination rates by LMPCR after a 48- and 96-h incubation period at 37 °C. The CPDs in UVB-irradiated DNA were repaired to completion using Escherichia coli CPD photolyase (1 μg of photolyase for 10 μg of UVB-damaged DNA) in a 100-μl reaction containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol. The photolyase reaction conditions were as described (31Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Riggs A.D. Holmquist G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1798-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, DNA was redissolved in water. The DNA was then incubated with 1 μg of recombinant His-tagged human MBD4 protein at 37 °C for 1 h in a 100-μl reaction containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol. MBD4 converts the uracil and thymine residues in the DNA, present as U/G or T/G mismatches and originating from cytosine and methlylated cytosine, respectively, into abasic sites (32Hendrich B. Hardeland U. Ng H.-H. Jiricny J. Bird A. Nature. 1999; 401: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 33Petronzelli F. Riccio A. Markham G.D. Seeholzer S.H. Stoerker J. Genuardi M. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Bellacosa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32422-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). An excess of MBD4 was used so that mismatches at both CpG and non-CpG sites were efficiently cleaved (33Petronzelli F. Riccio A. Markham G.D. Seeholzer S.H. Stoerker J. Genuardi M. Yeung A.T. Matsumoto Y. Bellacosa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32422-32429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) (data not shown). After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was incubated in 1 m piperidine at 37 °C for 15 min to convert the abasic sites into DNA strand breaks. LMPCR was performed on the enzyme-treated DNA as described (34Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers for LMPCR were as follows: 5′-CAAAAAAGGGAATAAGG-3′ (supF-1), 5′-CTTAGCTTTCGCTAAGG-3′ (supF-4), 5′-TAAGGGCGACACGGAAAT-3′ (supF-2), 5′-TCGCTAAGGATCCGGGT-3′ (supF-5), 5′-GAAATGTTGAATACTCATACTCTTCC-3′ (supF-3), 5′-AAGGATCCGGGTACCGAA-3′ (supF-6). In brief, oligonucleotide primer supF-1 or supF-4 was annealed to 0.5 μg of DNA after enzyme treatment, followed by primer extension of this primer at 48 °C with Sequenase 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). The oligonucleotide linker, consisting of a 25-mer annealed to an 11-mer oligonucleotide, was then ligated to the blunt-ended, primer-extended molecules. After ligation and precipitation of the DNA, gene-specific DNA fragments were amplified with Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by using the 25-mer of the linker and a gene-specific PCR primer (primer supF-2 orsupF-5) under conditions given previously (34Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After 21 cycles of PCR, the samples were phenol/chloroform-extracted and ethanol-precipitated, and the amplified fragments were separated on 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. The samples were run until the xylene cyanol dye reached the bottom of the sequencing gel, and the bottom 40 cm of the gel was electroblotted onto nylon membranes by using an electrotransfer device (Owl Scientific; Cambridge, MA). The sequences were visualized by autoradiography after hybridization with a single-stranded gene-specific PCR probe. The hybridization probes were made by repeated run-off polymerization using primer supF-3 or supF-6 and the respective PCR products as templates (35Törmänen V.T. Pfeifer G.P. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1729-1736PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical DNA sequencing reactions (36Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar) were used with all LMPCRs to provide sequence markers. As a control, the persistence of CPDs was measured along with the deamination experiments. In this assay, T4 endonuclease V- and photolyase-treated DNA was subjected to LMPCR analysis as described in previous studies (31Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Riggs A.D. Holmquist G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1798-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 34Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To study the mutational spectrum induced by UVB irradiation in a CpG-methylated gene, we used the shuttle vector pSP189, which contains the supF gene as a mutational target. The vector was methylated in vitro at all CpG sequences, using the CpG-specific DNA methyltransferase SssI. In parallel experiments, pSP189 was mock-methylated in the absence ofS-adenosylmethionine to produce an unmethylated counterpart. Completion of the methylation reaction was confirmed by digesting an aliquot of the reaction mixture with the methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HpaII. These methylated and unmethylated shuttle vectors were irradiated with UVB at a dose of 8000 J/m2. At this dose, approximately one CPD is produced every 0.5–0.8 kilobases. Nonirradiated DNA was used as a control. After irradiation, an aliquot of the methylated and unmethylated pSP189 vectors was transfected immediately into nucleotide excision repair deficient XP-A fibroblasts. The other aliquots of the UVB-irradiated plasmid were incubated at 37 °C in TE buffer to allow time for deamination of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine to occur within CPDs. After the different incubation times, these plasmids were transfected into XP-A fibroblasts. The cells were allowed to grow for 72 h after transfection. Then the plasmids were rescued, and the DNA was cleaved with DpnI to remove unreplicated plasmids still containing the bacterial GATC methylation pattern. UsingHpaII and HhaI digestion, we found that the level of CpG methylation was largely (>80%) maintained inDpnI-resistant DNA 72 h after transfection, indicating that there is no active removal of methyl groups from the methylated plasmids and that the methylation pattern is at least partially conserved during DNA replication (data not shown). Conversely, the unmethylated plasmid did not undergo de novo methylation. The rescued plasmids were then electroporated into MBM7070 bacteria, which carry a lacZ gene with an amber mutation. Plasmids were isolated from white colonies, and the supF gene was sequenced. Siblings, indicated by repeated appearance of the signature sequence, were about 2% of all plasmids and were excluded. The mutant frequencies in unmethylated and methylated UVB-treatedsupF vectors, incubated for different amounts of time before transfection, were determined (TableI). The mutant frequency in the absence of UV irradiation was generally below 1 × 10−3, and it was not different between unmethylated and methylated targets. After UVB irradiation and immediate transfection, the mutant frequency increased to 8–12 × 10−3 (a more than 13–18-fold increase). However, the mutant frequencies became even higher with increasing incubation times at 37 °C before transfection (Table I). At the longest incubation times, the mutant frequencies were almost 30 times higher than in the nonirradiated controls and were over 2 times higher than in DNA that was transfected immediately after irradiation. There was no major difference in the mutant frequency trends between unmethylated and methylated DNA. We confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis that no significant DNA degradation had occurred after a 96-h incubation at 37 °C.Table ISupF mutant frequenciesTreatmentNo. of total coloniesNo. of mutant coloniesMutant frequenciesMethylated pSP189No UVB + deamination (0 h)823050.61 × 10−3No UVB + deamination (24 h)12,34890.73 × 10−3No UVB + deamination (48 h)751470.93 × 10−3No UVB + deamination (96 h)962480.83 × 10−3UVB (8000 J/m2) + deamination (0 h)10,602847.92 × 10−3UVB (8000 J/m2) + deamination (24 h)36746217.19 × 10−3UVB (8000 J/m2) + deamination (48 h)14042719.23 × 10−3UVB (8000 J/m2) + deamination (96 h)40369022.30 × 10−3Unmethylated pSP189No UVB + deamination (0 h)10,93670.64 × 10−3No UVB + deamination (24 h)19,624120.61 × 10−3No UVB + deamination (48 h)10,64870.66 × 10−3No UVB + deamination (96 h)738470.95 × 10−3UVB (8000 J/m2) + deamination (0 h)24272911.95 × 10−3UVB (8000 J/m2) + deamination (24 h)708912117.07 × 10−3UVB (8000 J/m2) + deamination (48 h)34075415.85 × 10−3UVB (8000 J/m2) + deamination (96 h)423610123.84 × 10−3 Open table in a new tab Given the increases in mutant frequencies after the pretransfection incubation, we proceeded to determine the mutational spectra obtained under various conditions. Although there were few colonies obtained in the absence of UVB treatment, we sequenced the available mutants (Fig.1). Most of the mutations were deletions rather than single nucleotide changes. Further, we selected the samples obtained by immediate transfection and those obtained with the 96-h preincubation period for the sequencing analysis. This was done for both the unmethylated and the methylated plasmids (Figs. 2 and 3).Figure 2Mutation spectra induced by UVB irradiation into the unmethylated supF shuttle vectors.

When the DNA was incubated at 37 °C for 96 h before transfection, the frequency of tandem mutations, mostly CC → TT, increased. In the unmethylated samples immediately transfected, the percentage of tandem mutations was 9.3% (7 of 75). This value increased to 15.1% (13 of 86) in the sample that was transfected after 96 h. In the methylated samples immediately transfected, the percentage of tandem mutations was 6.4% (5 of 78). This value increased to 14.9% (13 of 87) in the sample that was transfected after 96 h. Although individually these differences did not reach statistical significance, the difference did become statistically significant (p < 0.05; χ2test) when the values from methylated and unmethylated plasmids were combined (26 of 173 versus 12 of 153 mutants were tandem mutations after delayed transfection). Thus, there is a clear trend toward an increase in tandem mutations, predominantly of the CC → TT type, after time is allowed for deamination to occur within CPD lesions.Table IITypes of supF mutations induced by UVB irradiation and CPD deaminationsupF control (no UVB)supF + UVB (8000 J/m2)Methylated 0-h deaminationMethylated 96-h deaminationUnmethylated 0-h deaminationUnmethylated 96-h deaminationMethylated 0-h deaminationMethylated 96-h deaminationUnmethylated 0-h deaminationUnmethylated 96-h deaminationC to T0 (0)aPercentage of all mutations in parentheses.2 (25)1 (33)2 (40)58 (74)71 (82)68 (91)65 (76)C to A2 (40)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)6 (8)0 (0)0 (0)1 (1)C to G0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)2 (3)0 (0)0 (0)1 (1)T to C0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)1 (1)T to A0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)2 (3)1 (1)0 (0)0 (0)T to G0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)Deletion2 (40)6 (75)3 (60)2 (40)3 (4)1 (1)0 (0)5 (6)Insertion1 (20)0 (0)1 (33)1 (20)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)Tandem0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)5 (6)13 (15)7 (9)13 (15)Multiple0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)2 (3)1 (1)0 (0)0 (0)Total5 (100)8 (100)5 (100)5 (100)78 (100)87 (100)75 (100)86 (100)CC → TT out of tandem mutations0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)0 (0)5/5 (100)11/13 (85)7/7 (100)13/13 (100)Percentage of all mutations at CpG0/5 (0)0/8 (0)0/3 (0)0/5 (0)28/78 (36)45/87 (52)18/75 (24)18/86 (21)a Percentage of all mutations in parentheses.

When comparing the unmethylated and CpG-methylated mutational targets, there was a noticeable trend for the mutation hot spots to occur at dipyrimidines involving 5-methylcytosine (i.e. PymCG trinucleotides). For the unmethylated plasmid, 24% of the mutations involved CpG dinucleotides when the DNA was transfected immediately. This value was 21% when the transfection was done after 96 h (Table II).

https://openalex.org/W2088587322,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a multifunctional serine/threonine phosphatase that is critical to many cellular processes including cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. PP2A is a heterotrimer containing a structural (A) and catalytic (C) subunit, associated with one variable regulatory or targeting B-type subunit, of which three families have been described to date (B/PR55, B′/PR61, and B“/PR72). We identified two functional and highly conserved Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs in human B”/PR72 (denoted EF1 and EF2), demonstrating for the first time the ability of Ca2+ to interact directly with and regulate PP2A. EF1 and EF2 apparently bind Ca2+ with different affinities. Ca2+ induces a significant conformational change, which is dependent on the integrity of the motifs. We have further evaluated the effects of Ca2+ on subunit composition, subcellular targeting, catalytic activity, and function during the cell cycle of a PR72-containing PP2A trimer (PP2AT72) by site-directed mutagenesis of either or both motifs. The results suggest that integrity of EF2 is required for A/PR65 subunit interaction and proper nuclear targeting of PR72, whereas EF1 might mediate the effects of Ca2+ on PP2AT72 activity in vitro and is at least partially required for the ability of PR72 to alter cell cycle progression upon forced expression. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a multifunctional serine/threonine phosphatase that is critical to many cellular processes including cell cycle regulation and signal transduction. PP2A is a heterotrimer containing a structural (A) and catalytic (C) subunit, associated with one variable regulatory or targeting B-type subunit, of which three families have been described to date (B/PR55, B′/PR61, and B“/PR72). We identified two functional and highly conserved Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs in human B”/PR72 (denoted EF1 and EF2), demonstrating for the first time the ability of Ca2+ to interact directly with and regulate PP2A. EF1 and EF2 apparently bind Ca2+ with different affinities. Ca2+ induces a significant conformational change, which is dependent on the integrity of the motifs. We have further evaluated the effects of Ca2+ on subunit composition, subcellular targeting, catalytic activity, and function during the cell cycle of a PR72-containing PP2A trimer (PP2AT72) by site-directed mutagenesis of either or both motifs.

Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar and 2Sontag E. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). This extraordinary functional diversity can be explained by the existence of several mechanisms by which PP2A activity, substrate specificity, and subcellular localization are regulated (reviewed in Ref. 1Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). One of the major ways to achieve this is by the interaction, through a scaffolding A/PR65 subunit, of the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2AC) with one of several regulatory B-type subunits. Although it has been suggested that a significant part of PP2AC can occur as a dimer with the A/PR65 subunit (PP2AD) within cells (3Kremmer E. Ohst K. Kiefer J. Brewis N. Walter G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1692-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), recent evidence argues that PP2A is an obligate trimer (PP2AT) in vivo (4Silverstein A.M. Barrow C.A. Davis A.J. Mumby M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4221-4226Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 5Li X. Scuderi A. Letsou A. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3674-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there are a number of well documented cases at variance with this central “dogma,” such as the association of PP2AC with α4 without any other subunits (6Murata K. Wu J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the complex formation of PP2AC, the B′ subunit and cyclin G2, without the A subunit (7Bennin D.A. Don Arachchige A.S. Brake T. McKenzie J.L. Rosenbaum H. Ortiz L. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Horne M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27449-27467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and the association of PP2AD with some viral tumor antigens (8Ruediger R. Hentz M. Fait J. Mumby M. Walter G. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 123-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PP2A regulatory subunits are encoded by four multigene families, referred to as B, B′, B“, and B‴. All B-type subunits, with exception of B‴, share two motifs for A/PR65 subunit binding (9Li X. Virshup D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because B‴ subunits lack these binding motifs, their status as real PP2A subunits needs further evaluation. Each B subunit is thought to confer a set of specific functional characteristics to the phosphatase. For example, the B subunits have been implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal protein assembly (10Turowski P. Myles T. Hemmings B.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1997-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Lee G. Brandt R. Kamibayashi C. Kuret J. White C.L. Mumby C. Bloom G.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3674-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The B′ subunits, on the other hand, mediate PP2A function in the Wnt signaling cascade (12Seeling J.M. Miller J.R. Gil R.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3674-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The functions of the B“ subunit family are probably the least well understood. Five different B” isoforms have been identified in mammals: human PR72 and PR130 (the founding members of the family) (15Hendrix P. Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Cron P. Goris J. Hofsteenge J. Merlevede W. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15267-15276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse PR59 (16Voorhoeve P.M. Hijmans E.M. Bernards R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), human PR48 (17Yan Z. Fedorov S.A. Mumby M.C. Williams R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and the recently identified human G5PR (18Kono Y. Maeda K. Kuwahara K. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Yonezawa K. Takagi K. Sakaguchi N. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although B“ homologues have been described in plants (19Camilleri C. Azimzadeh J. Pastuglia M. Bellini C. Grandjean O. Bouchez D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 833-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar),Xenopus laevis oocytes (20Stevens I. Janssens V. Martens E. Dilworth S. Goris J. Van Hoof C. Eur. J.

PR72 and PR130 are splice variants generated from a single gene and share an identical C terminus. PR72 has a muscle-specific expression, whereas PR130 is ubiquitous (15Hendrix P. Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Cron P. Goris J. Hofsteenge J. Merlevede W. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15267-15276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In anin vitro assay, PP2AT72 is the only PP2A trimer that specifically stimulates simian virus 40 large T-antigen-dependent origin unwinding, an essential step in the initiation of viral DNA replication (21Cegielska A. Shaffer S. Derua R. Goris J. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4616-4623Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). PR59 was identified as interaction partner of the retinoblastoma-like p107 protein. Its overexpression results in G1/S arrest of cell cycle progression and coincides with increased amounts of hypophosphorylated and active p107 (16Voorhoeve P.M. Hijmans E.M. Bernards R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PR48 was identified as a Cdc6-interacting protein (17Yan Z. Fedorov S.A. Mumby M.C. Williams R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cdc6 is an ATPase required for the initiation of DNA replication that primarily acts by recruiting the minichromosome maintenance complex to origins of replication (22Gowen Cook J. Park C.H. Burke T.W. DeGregori J. Engel A. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1347-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Recent results indicate, however, that PR48 is a partial clone that would better be renamed as “PR70,” fitting with its real molecular mass (20Stevens I. Janssens V. Martens E. Dilworth S. Goris J. Van Hoof C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1-12Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). G5PR was identified as a germinal center-associated nuclear protein (GANP)-associated molecule by yeast two-hybrid screening (18Kono Y. Maeda K. Kuwahara K. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Yonezawa K. Takagi K. Sakaguchi N. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). GANP carries DNA primase and minichromosome maintenance 3-binding activity and is thought to be involved in the regulation of DNA replication in activated germinal center B cells (23Kuwahara K. Yoshida M. Kondo E. Sakata A. Watanabe Y. Kouno Y. Tomiyasu S. Fujimura S. Tokuhisa T. Kimura H. Ezaki T. Sakaguchi N. Blood. 2000; 95: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kuwahara K. Tomiyasu S. Fujimura S. Nomura K. Xing Y. Nishiyama N. Ogawa M. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Izuta S. Sakaguchi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10279-10283Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, G5PR also strongly interacts with the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of protein phosphatase 5, another eukaryotic serine/threonine phosphatase (18Kono Y. Maeda K. Kuwahara K. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Yonezawa K. Takagi K. Sakaguchi N. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In general, most of the functions of the B” subunits described so far argue for important roles of these proteins in the regulation of the G1/S transition of the cell cycle and the regulation of DNA replication during S phase. Calcium is an important second messenger within cells. Highly regulated changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration control biological processes as diverse as muscle contraction, fertilization, cell proliferation and division, gene transcription, and apoptosis (reviewed in Ref. 25Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4435) Google Scholar). Many of these effects are modulated by multiple classes of Ca2+-binding proteins, some of which can in turn regulate multiple downstream effectors. Among the major intracellular Ca2+ receptors are calmodulin (CaM) and S100 proteins. Both are members of a large class of so-called “EF-hand” Ca2+-binding proteins, which share a common Ca2+-binding helix-loop-helix motif, the conformation of which essentially determines biological function. Specific binding of Ca2+ to the loop alters the conformation of the motif, involving the rearrangement of both helices in three-dimensional space (reviewed in Ref. 26Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In many Ca2+ sensor proteins this conformational change exposes a hydrophobic effector protein-binding surface, which in turn allows them to bind to and regulate an array of secondary effector proteins (27Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Although calcineurin (also known as protein phosphatase 2B) and protein phosphatase 7 are the only serine/threonine phosphatases known so far to be regulated directly by Ca2+ (28Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 29Huang X. Honkanen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1462-1468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), several reports have suggested a role for PP2A in Ca2+-dependent signaling. PP2A has been shown to associate with the CaM-dependent kinase IV (30Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1258-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and with the CaM-binding proteins striatin and S/G2 nuclear autoantigen (also known as the B‴ or PR93/PR110 subunits) (31Moreno C.S. Park S. Nelson K. Ashby D. Hubalek F. Lane W.S. Pallas D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5257-5263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, PP2A has been implicated in the regulation of Ca2+-activated potassium channels by glucocorticoids (32Sansom S.C. Stockand J.D. Hall D. Williams B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9902-9906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,33Tian L. Knaus H.G. Shipston M.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar), and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor signaling complex (37DeSouza N. Reiken S. Ondrias K. Yang Y.M. Matkovich S. Marks A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39397-39400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Inversely, calcium ions have also been shown to regulate PP2A activity in G-protein-coupled receptor signaling (38Chen F. Vu N.D. Wagner P.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) or PP2A (re)localization in the establishment of cell-cell contacts between epithelial cells (39Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Machleidt T. Ogris E. Belloto D. White III, C.L. Sontag E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 967-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and during mast cell secretion (40Ludowycke R.I. Holst J. Mudge L.M. Sim A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6144-6152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this report we identify two Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs in human B“/PR72, demonstrating for the first time, the ability of calcium ions to directly interact with and regulate PP2A. By a mutational analysis of both domains, we evaluate the effects of Ca2+ on PP2AT72 subunit composition, subcellular targeting, catalytic activity, and function during the cell cycle. The results obtained suggest that both motifs serve different functions. 45CaCl2 (2.5 mCi/ml, 110.8 μg of Ca2+/ml), [35S]methionine, and protein G-Sepharose beads were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Fermentas. Calcium ionophore A23187, propidium iodide, and Hoechst 33342 were from Sigma. BAPTA-AM was supplied by Alexis Biochemicals; nocodazole was from Applichem. The bacterial expression vector for the His-tagged domain I of calpastatin was a generous gift of Dr. J. Elce (Cancer Research Laboratories, Department of Biochemistry, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada). The protein was expressed and purified on nickel-agarose beads (Affiland) following standard procedures. Anti-EGFP antibodies were a kind gift of Dr. M. Beullens (Division of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium). Anti-PP2AC and anti-PR65 monoclonal antibodies were generously supplied by Dr. S. Dilworth (Department of Metabolic Medicine, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK). Pwo proofreading polymerase (used in all PCRs) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Two point mutations were introduced in each EF-hand using a PCR-based method. For the introduction of a single point mutation into EF1, two separate PCRs were performed with PR72 cDNA as template: the first with 5′-ATATCATATGATGATCAAGGAAACATCTC-3′ (start primer) and 5′-GTATCGAGACAGAGCGGCCTGGC-3′ (reverse mutated primer) and the second with 5′-GCCAGGCCGCTCTGTCTCGATAC-3′ (forward mutated primer) and 5′-TATAGGATCCCTATTCTTCATCCACTGATTG-3′ (stop primer). The combined reaction products of these two PCRs were then used as template for a second amplification round with the start and stop primers only. The resulting PCR product was cloned into theEcoRV-digested pBluescript vector (Stratagene) and sequenced to confirm the introduction of the mutation. The second point mutation within EF1 was introduced very similarly with the start primer, 5′-GGTCGTGATCAGTAGCTAGTTCCCAG-3′ (reverse mutated primer), 5′-CTGGGAACTAGCTACTGATCACGACC-3′ (forward mutated primer), and the stop primer using the single EF1 point mutant as template. Together, the PR72 EF1 sequence290 DTDHDLYISQADL302was changed into290 ATDHDLYISQAAL302. For mutation of EF2, the first mutation round was performed with the start primer, 5′-CATAGAAGTACTCCAATGCATACATGGAGAG-3′ (reverse mutated primer), 5′-CTCTCCATGTATGCATTGGAGTACTTCTATG-3′ (forward mutated primer) and the stop primer using PR72 as template. The second point mutation was generated very similarly with the start primer, 5′-GTCTCCATCCACAGCCATGCAGCGG-3′ (reverse mutated primer), 5′-CCGCTGCATGGCTGTGGATGGAGAC-3′ (forward mutated primer) and the stop primer using the single EF2 point mutant as template. In this way the wild-type EF2 sequence364 DVDGDGVLSMYEL376 was eventually changed into364 AVDGDGVLSMYAL376. The double mutation of EF1 and EF2 was generated via four consecutive mutation rounds using the same primers and the same PCR-based method. Wild-type PR72, N- and/or C-terminal truncations of wild-type PR72, and the single or double EF hand mutants thereof were cloned into pET15b, pET3C (Novagen), pGEX-4T2 or pGEX-4T3 (AmershamBiosciences) following standard molecular biology procedures. The resulting plasmids were transformed into BL21-pLys(RP)Escherichia coli bacteria for protein expression. Inductions were performed with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h 30 min at 30 °C. Bacterial pellets were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with 2 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Inclusion bodies were purified (41Marston F.A. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar) and solubilized in 7 m guanidinium hydrochloride. After dialysis against buffer B (200 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.2, 500 mm NaCl), the majority of the proteins remained soluble. Ca2+ binding to the recombinant (fusion) proteins was measured after transfer to Immobilon P membranes (42Sienaert I. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Missiaen L. Vanlingen S. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27005-27012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes were washed overnight at room temperature in nominally Ca2+-free incubation medium containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 60 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. Binding was carried out in the same medium supplemented with 1.5 μCi/ml 45CaCl2for 10 min at room temperature. Membranes were washed during 2 min in 50% ice-cold ethanol/water mixture and air-dried. Bands were visualized by autoradiography. Protein concentrations of purified recombinant proteins, comprising amino acids (aa) 262–449 of PR72, were evaluated by absorbance measurement at 280 nm and by the BCA quantification method (Pierce). Equal amounts of PR72 aa262–449 or PR72 EF(1 + 2)mut aa262–449 were diluted in buffer B and excited at 295 nm. The fluorescence spectra between 300 and 410 nm were recorded in a Photon Technology International spectrofluorometer in the absence or the presence of different amounts of CaCl2buffered by 1 mm EGTA. Free Ca2+ concentration was calculated with the CaBuf program (available at ftp.cc.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/droogmans/cabuf.zip). [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were obtained from pBluescript vectors containing the coding regions of PR72, PR72 EF1mut, PR72 EF2mut, or PR72 EF(1 + 2)mut, using the TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) with the appropriate RNA polymerase (T3 or T7). The GST-PR65α subunit of PP2A (PR65-GST) and the free GST protein were produced in E. coliBL21-pLys cells following standard procedures, and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GST pull-down binding reactions contained 20 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins, 1 μg of GST or PR65-GST, 20 μl of prewashed glutathione-Sepharose beads, and NENT100 buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 25% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl) to a final volume of 500 μl. If appropriate, either 2 mm EGTA or 4 mm CaCl2 was added to the reaction mix. Incubation was done for 4 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The beads were washed five times with 1 ml of NENT300 (NENT with 300 mm NaCl) containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and either 2 mm EGTA or 4 mm CaCl2. Bound proteins were eluted by addition of 20 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiling. The eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and imaged using an AmershamBiosciences PhosphorImager. Monkey COS7, human U2OS, and rat L6 cells were supplied by the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). COS7 and U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 g/liter glucose (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom KG). Rat L6 myoblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5 g/liter glucose (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of subconfluent L6 cells were prepared as described (43Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.L. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9154) Google Scholar). To generate VP-16 fusion proteins for use in mammalian double-hybrid experiments, PCR fragments of PR72, PR72 EF1mut, PR72 EF2mut, PR72 EF(1 + 2)mut, A/PR65α, B/PR55α, and B′/PR61γ1 were cloned into the EcoRV restriction site of the pSNATCH-II plasmid, encoding residues 413–498 of the VP16 activating region (44Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For the expression of PP2A regulatory subunits fused to residues 1–147 of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor, PCR-generated fragments encoding PR72, PR72 EF1mut, PR72 EF2mut, PR72 EF(1 + 2)mut1, A/PR65α, B/PR55α, and B′/PR61γ were inserted in the SmaI restriction site of the pAB-Gal4 plasmid (45Baniahmad A. Kohne A.C. Renkawitz R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter plasmid pUAS-TATA-luc contains 5 GAL4-binding sites in front of a minimal promoter (TATA box). pSNATCH-II, pAB-Gal4, and pUAS-TATA-luc were a kind gift of Dr. F. Claessens (Division of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium). All transfections for the mammalian double-hybrid experiments were performed in COS7 cells in 24-well culture plates (Nunc) with FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 400 ng of pUAS-TATA-luc, 400 ng of pAB-Gal4, and 40 ng of the pSNATCH-II plasmid per well was used, along with 40 ng of a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid (pEF1-βGal) to correct for different transfection efficiencies. In the latter plasmid β-galactosidase expression is driven by the human translation elongation factor 1 promoter. Transfected cells were lysed in 100 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured in 10 μl of the extracts using the assay systems from Promega and Tropix, respectively. For yeast two-hybrid experiments, GAL4 binding and activation domain fusion proteins were generated by cloning PCR fragments of full-length PR72 (wild-type or mutated in either or both EF-hands) and of several PR72 deletions in the pGBT9 and pGAD424 vectors (Clontech), respectively. The PR72 deletion fragments used encompassed aa1–99, aa1–219, aa1–358, aa123–473, aa353–529, and aa219–529. All transformations were performed in the PJ69–4A Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain (46James P. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) harboring adenine, β-galactosidase, and histidine reporter plasmids under the control of GAL4 upstream-activating sequences. For the evaluation of positive interactions, only the expression of the adenine and β-galactosidase reporters were assayed. PCR fragments of PR72, PR72 EF1mut, PR72 EF2mut, and PR72 EF(1 + 2)mut were cloned into the SmaI restriction site of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). 1 μg of each plasmid was transfected into COS7 cells grown on a glass coverslip in a 6-cm dish (Nunc) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. 24–36 h after transfection cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 20 min. Following the addition of 3 μm Hoechst 33342 for 10 min to stain the nuclei, cells were briefly rinsed in water, mounted in mounting medium (Sigma), and examined by a fluorescence microscope (Diaplan, Leitz, Germany) equipped with a digital camera (DC200, Leica Microsystems). For anti-EGFP immunoprecipitations, transfected cells were lysed in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Before addition of the anti-EGFP antibody, lysates were precleared with 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times in lysis buffer and once with 0.1 mm LiCl before addition of SDS sample buffer, boiling, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting. Blots were developed with a mixture of anti-PP2AC and anti-PR65 monoclonal antibodies using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein phosphatase assays were performed with 32P-labeled phosphorylase aas the substrate in the absence of protamine stimulation, essentially as described (15Hendrix P. Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Cron P. Goris J. Hofsteenge J. Merlevede W. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15267-15276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PP2AT72, purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (15Hendrix P. Mayer-Jaekel R.E. Cron P. Goris J. Hofsteenge J. Merlevede W. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15267-15276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was preincubated with calpastatin (an inhibitor of the m-calpain protease) and different amounts of CaCl2 for 10 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, different amounts of EGTA were added together with the substrate. This mixture was further incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and the amount of free 32P-labeled phosphate was counted. Similar experiments were performed by including the Ca2+ and/or EGTA concentrations directly in the phosphatase assay. Because this approach basically resulted in the same data, this indicated that Ca2+/EGTA effects are “instantaneous,” and prior incubation of Ca2+ and/or EGTA with the enzyme is not required"
https://openalex.org/W2003434224,"Rate studies have been employed as a reporter function to probe protein-protein interactions within a biochemically defined reconstituted N-end rule ubiquitin ligation pathway. The concentration dependence for E1-catalyzed HsUbc2b/E214kb transthiolation is hyperbolic and yields Km values of 102 ± 13 nm and 123 ± 19 nm for high affinity binding to rabbit and human E1/Uba1 orthologs. Competitive inhibition by the inactive substrate and product analogs HsUbc2bC88A (Ki = 104 ± 15 nm) and HsUbc2bC88S-ubiquitin oxyester (Ki = 169 ± 17 nm), respectively, indicates that the ubiquitin moiety contributes little to E1 binding. Under conditions of rate-limiting E3α-catalyzed conjugation to human α-lactalbumin, HsUbc2b-ubiquitin thiolester exhibits a Ki of 54 ± 18 nm and is competitively inhibited by the substrate analog HsUbc2bC88S-ubiquitin oxyester (Ki = 66 ± 29 nm). In contrast, the ligase product analog HsUbc2bC88A exhibits aKi of 440 ± 55 nm with respect to the wild type HsUbc2b-ubiquitin thiolester, demonstrating that ubiquitin binding contributes to the ability of E3α to discriminate between substrate and product E2. A survey of E1 and E2 isoform distribution in selected cell lines demonstrates that Ubc2 isoforms are the predominant intracellular ubiquitin carrier protein. Intracellular levels of E1 and Ubc2 are micromolar and approximately equal based on in vitro quantitation by stoichiometric125I-ubiquitin thiolester formation. Comparison of intracellular E1 and Ubc2 pools with the corresponding ubiquitin pools reveals that most of the free ubiquitin in cells is present as thiolesters to the components of the conjugation pathways.

The present data represent the first comprehensive analysis of protein interactions within a ubiquitin ligation pathway. The majority of short-lived cellular proteins are targeted for degradation by the 26 S proteasome in response to assembly of degradation signals on their surface comprising chains of ubiquitin moieties covalently linked through specific lysine residues (1Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Google Scholar). Target protein specificity for this process is determined in part by a large family of diverse ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases (E3) 1The abbreviations used are: E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; DTT, dithiothreitol; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein, also termed ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc); FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography that recognize specific features of the native structure (2Bartel B. Wünning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Google Scholar, 3Sadis S. Atienza C. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4086-4094Google Scholar, 4Hershko A. Heller H. Eytan E. Reiss Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11992-11999Google Scholar), transposabletrans-acting amino acid sequences (5Klotzbucher A. Stewart E. Harrison D. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3053-3064Google Scholar, 6McGarry T.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1043-1053Google Scholar, 7Yamano H. Tsurumi C. Gannon J. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5670-5678Google Scholar), or exposed regions of non-native conformation (8Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 543-550Google Scholar). The activated ubiquitin required to drive isopeptide bond formation is donated by specific ubiquitin carrier proteins (E2/Ubc), also termed ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, in which the ubiquitin carboxyl terminus is bound as a thiolester to a conserved cysteine (9Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Google Scholar, 10Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Google Scholar). The apparent specificity of different isopeptide ligases for recognizing a single or limited number of E2 isozymes accounts for the large cohort of related carrier protein isoforms (9Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Google Scholar, 10Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Google Scholar, 11Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Google Scholar). Some E2 moieties may contribute to the substrate specificity of their cognate E3 isozyme because they are able to associate with targets in the absence of ligase (12Kalchman M.A. Graham R.K. Xia G. Koide H.B. Hodgson J.G. Graham K.C. Goldberg Y.P. Gietz R.D. Pickart C.M. Hayden M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19385-19394Google Scholar, 13Saitoh H. Pu R. Cavenagh M. Dasso M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In addition, a subset of E2 isozymes catalyzes formation of polyubiquitin degradation signals on model protein substrates in the absence of their cognate E3 (15Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Google Scholar, 16Haas A.L. Reback P.B. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5104-5112Google Scholar, 17Chen Z. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21835-21842Google Scholar, 18Van Demark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Google Scholar). The E3-independent conjugation reactions catalyzed by these selected isoforms presumably reflect catalytic roles within their respective ligase-dependent substrate targeting mechanisms. Ubiquitin thiolester formation to the different E2 isozymes occurs by transfer of this moiety from a ternary complex of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) containing two forms of activated ubiquitin polypeptide: a tightly bound ubiquitin adenylate intermediate and a covalent E1-ubiquitin thiolester (19Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Google Scholar, 20Haas A.L. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10329-10337Google Scholar). Plants inexplicably contain multiple E1 isozymes (21Hatfield P.M. Vierstra R.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 735-742Google Scholar), whereas other eukaryotes possess a single gene that is transcribed into a 3.5-kb message subject to translation at alternate start sites to yield cytoplasmic and nuclear isoforms of 110 and 117 kDa, respectively (22Stephen A.G. Trauschazar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15608-15614Google Scholar). The additional amino-terminal 40 residues of the 117-kDa E1 contain a nuclear localization signal and multiple phosphorylation sites that promote sequestering of this isozyme within the nucleus (22Stephen A.G. Trauschazar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15608-15614Google Scholar). Because each ligase family recognizes a cognate E2 or its orthologs, rates of conjugation through the different pathways and, therefore, their contribution to degradative targeting, depend on efficient loading of these enzymes by the E1 ternary complex (9Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Google Scholar). We have shown recently that ubiquitin ligation is amenable to detailed kinetic analysis in biochemically defined in vitro assays (23Baboshina O.V. Crinelli R. Siepmann T.J. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39428-39437Google Scholar, 24Lawson T.G. Sweep M.E. Schlax P.E. Bohnsack R.N. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39629-39637Google Scholar). In the present work, we extend these studies to protein-protein interactions among the components of the N-end rule targeting pathway for ubiquitin conjugation. This pathway requires the E3 isozyme Ubr1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Bartel B. Wünning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Google Scholar) and the 19.7-kDa E2 isozyme Rad6/ScUbc2 2In this and subsequent manuscripts we will use the empirical functional/phylogenetic family classification and systematic nomenclature for the E2/Ubc isoforms presented earlier (9Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Google Scholar). (25Dohmen R.J. Madura K. Bartel B. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7351-7355Google Scholar). In rabbit reticulocytes the corresponding pathway is catalyzed by E3α, the mammalian Ubr1 ortholog, in concert with HsUbc2/E214kb (23Baboshina O.V. Crinelli R. Siepmann T.J. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39428-39437Google Scholar, 26Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Google Scholar, 27Reiss Y. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3685-3690Google Scholar), the 17.3-kDa mammalian E2 ortholog of S. cerevisiae Rad6 (9Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Google Scholar). We have employed rate studies to determine the affinity for binding of HsUbc2b 3Human HsUbc2b is identical to rabbit OcUbc2b, previously termed E214kb and HHR6B (9Haas A.L. Siepmann T.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1257-1268Google Scholar). to E1 and of the corresponding HsUbc2b-ubiquitin thiolester to E3α. In addition, active site mutants of the E2 have been used to estimate affinities for product binding to E1 and E3α. The latter results have cautionary implications for the unambiguous interpretation of in vivoobservations based on overexpression of dominant negative E2 mutants. Finally, activity assays involving 125I-ubiquitin thiolester formation have been exploited to quantitate intracellular concentrations of E1 and Ubc2 within selected cell lines. Comparison of these binding constants with the concentrations of the components required for N-end rule-dependent ligation suggests that the three enzymes of this pathway minimally form dynamic binary complexes within the cell. Bovine ubiquitin, creatine phosphokinase, yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase, yeast hexokinase, and human α-lactalbumin were purchased from Sigma. The yeast inorganic pyrophosphatase and human α-lactalbumin were further purified to apparent homogeneity (23Baboshina O.V. Crinelli R. Siepmann T.J. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39428-39437Google Scholar). The ubiquitin was also further purified to homogeneity (15Baboshina O.V. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2823-2831Google Scholar) then radioiodinated by the chloramine-T procedure (28Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs or Amersham Biosciences. Carrier-free Na125I and [2,8-3H]ATP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Rabbit liver, rabbit reticulocyte, and human erythrocyte E1 enzymes were purified to apparent homogeneity by adapting previously reported affinity chromatography and FPLC methods (29Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Google Scholar), then quantitated by 125I-ubiquitin thiolester assay and confirmed by the stoichiometric formation of ubiquitin [3H]adenylate (19Haas A.L. Warms J.V. Hershko A. Rose I.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2543-2548Google Scholar, 29Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, rabbit reticulocyte E1 was used in all kinetic studies for which the activation step was kinetically isolated, whereas the more abundant but otherwise identical liver enzyme was used for studies in which it served only as a reagent for generating E2 thiolester. Human recombinant HsUbc2b (23Baboshina O.V. Crinelli R. Siepmann T.J. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39428-39437Google Scholar) was purified to apparent homogeneity using previously established methods and then quantitated by its stoichiometric formation of 125I-ubiquitin thiolester formation in the presence of E1 (29Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte Fraction II was prepared by phenylhydrazine induction (28Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte and liver E3α were purified from Fraction II by E2-ligand affinity chromatography (23Baboshina O.V. Crinelli R. Siepmann T.J. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39428-39437Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte E3α was used in all kinetic studies for which the ligase step was rate-limiting, whereas the more abundant liver E3α was used in coupled assays as a reagent ligase in all other rate studies. The human/rabbit HsUbc2b coding sequence was excised from plasmid pECO10, derived from pKK223-3 (30Wing S.S. Dumas F. Banville D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6495-6501Google Scholar), and cloned into plasmid pET11d to generate pET-HsUbc2b. Mutation of the active site cysteine 88 of human HsUbc2b to either alanine or serine was achieved by the PCR-based overlap extension protocol of Ho et al. (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar) to generate pET-HsUbc2bC88A and pET-HsUbc2bC88S, respectively. The complete HsUbc2b coding regions of these constructs were sequenced using a Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) to confirm the desired base change(s) and the absence of secondary mutations introduced by the PCR steps. A single colony of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain harboring the appropriate plasmid was grown in 10 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin for 6 h at 37 °C, and then 50 μl was used to inoculate a 250-ml overnight culture of the same medium. The next morning 10 liters of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were inoculated with 100 ml of the overnight culture and then grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.8–1.0 in a VirTis 20-liter fermenter. Expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Following expression for 1.5 h, cells were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 × gfor 25 min and then resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm DTT (Buffer A) to ∼30% (w/v) before lysing by French press. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Recombinant wild type HsUbc2b and HsUbc2bC88S were assayed by their stoichiometric formation of 125I-ubiquitin thiolester or oxyester, respectively, in brief incubations (29Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Google Scholar). Recombinant HsUbc2bC88A was assayed by Western blot using an affinity-purified rabbit anti-HsUbc2 antibody and recombinant HsUbc2b standards (32Wunsch A.M. Haas A.L. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 118-132Google Scholar, 33Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Google Scholar). The resulting lysate was then centrifuged at 105 ×g for 1 h after which the high speed supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.5 with 1 m NaOH followed by bulk absorption to 250 ml of DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE52) equilibrated in Buffer A. The DEAE slurry was stirred gently at 4 °C for 1 h to allow complete adsorption of protein and then washed on a Buchner funnel with 3 bed volumes of Buffer A, followed by batch elution with 2 bed volumes of Buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. Protein in the eluate was precipitated by adjusting to 80% saturated ammonium sulfate then recovered by centrifugation for 20 min at 104× g. The pellet was suspended in 50 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT (Buffer B) and then dialyzed overnight against 2 liters of the same. The dialysate was loaded onto a 5 × 10-cm Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (AmershamBiosciences) column equilibrated with Buffer B and fitted to anAmersham Biosciences FPLC system. Protein was eluted with a linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient (1.7 mm/min) in Buffer B at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Fractions containing HsUbc2b activity (0.18m elution position) were pooled and adjusted to a final concentration of 1.8 m ammonium sulfate and then applied to a 3 × 25-cm phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 1.8 m ammonium sulfate in Buffer B. Protein was eluted with a negative linear gradient of 1.8–0m ammonium sulfate (7.2 mm/min) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Wild type and mutant HsUbc2b enzymes eluted at ∼0.5m ammonium sulfate. Aliquots from the phenyl-Sepharose column containing HsUbc2b were pooled and dialyzed against 1 liter of Buffer B before being loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/10 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer B. Protein was eluted from the Mono Q column with a linear 0–0.5 m NaCl gradient (12.5 mm/ml) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Mono Q fractions with HsUbc2b activity were pooled and concentrated to less than 5 ml on an Amicon cell fitted with a PM10 membrane and then resolved on a 10 × 30-cm Superose-12 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT and 50 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The isolated HsUbc2b proteins were greater than 99% pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. Absolute protein concentrations were calculated spectrophotometrically using an empirical ε280 of 1.71 (mg/ml)−1 for native HsUbc2b, determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm of a solution of apparently homogeneous recombinant HsUbc2b for which the absolute protein concentration had been determined by amino acid analysis. Typical final yields ranged from 1 to 1.5 mg of HsUbc2b protein/liter of culture and were usually greater than 90% active by comparing the stoichiometric formation of 125I-ubiquitin thiolester to the absolute protein concentration. Isolated proteins were stored at −80 °C for several months without loss of activity. Initial rates of 125I-ubiquitin thiolester formation on HsUbc2b were measured in 175-μl reactions containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm DTT, 10 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 μm125I-ubiquitin (about 3,000 cpm/pmol), 0.7 nm rabbit reticulocyte E1, and the indicated concentrations of HsUbc2b. Aliquots of 25 μl were removed at 30-s intervals over the first 1.5 min and quenched with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer. Thiolesters were then resolved from free 125I-ubiquitin by 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions at 4 °C (29Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Google Scholar). Bands containing E2 thiolesters, visualized by autoradiography of the dried gels, were excised and quantitated by γ counting. Binding interactions between the E1 ternary complex and HsUbc2b were quantitated kinetically as the initial net forward rate of E1-catalyzed ubiquitin transthiolation to HsUbc2b by directly coupling this step to E3α-catalyzed conjugation of human α-lactalbumin under E1-limiting conditions. Incubations of 25 μl contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm DTT, 10 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 μm125I-ubiquitin, 0.34 nm rabbit reticulocyte E1, ∼1.5 μg affinity-purified rabbit liver E3α, and the indicated concentrations of human wild type recombinant HsUbc2b. Samples were incubated for 25 min at 37 °C, quenched with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer containing 4% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. Radiolabeled conjugates were then resolved from free125I-ubiquitin by 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography of the dried gels. Radioactive conjugates from each sample were excised from the gel and quantitated by γ counting (28Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Google Scholar). The interaction of HsUbc2bC88A or HsUbc2bC88S-ubiquitin oxyester with the E1 ternary complex was measured by the concentration-dependent inhibition of wild type HsUbc2b/E3α-catalyzed 125I-ubiquitin conjugation of human α-lactalbumin under conditions identical to those for the HsUbc2b/E1 assays except that [HsUbc2b]o was held constant at 180 nm. Maximum velocity in the absence of inhibitor was determined in a parallel reaction containing saturating wild type HsUbc2b (1.0 μm). The HsUbc2bC88S-ubiquitin oxyester adduct used in the inhibitor studies was stoichiometrically formed during a 30-min incubation at 37 °C in a 100-μl final volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 IU/ml PPi, 20 nm rabbit liver E1, 40 μm125I-ubiquitin, and 34 μm HsUbc2bC88S. The resulting HsUbc2bC88S-125I-ubiquitin oxyester adduct was resolved from other reaction components by gel exclusion chromatography using a 1 × 30-cm analytical Superdex 75 FPLC column (AmershamBiosciences) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 50 mm NaCl. The concentration of HsUbc2bC88S-125I-ubiquitin oxyester was determined from the associated radioactivity of peak fractions quantitated by γ counting and confirmed by direct determination of oxyester following nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Binding interactions between the 125I-ubiquitin thiolesters of wild type recombinant HsUbc2b and affinity-purified E3α were quantitated under E3α-limiting conditions identical to those in the preceding section with the exception that incubations contained 65 nmrabbit liver E1 and the indicated concentrations of HsUbc2b and E3α. Inhibition studies were conducted under identical conditions with the exception that wild type [HsUbc2b]o was held constant at 25 nm (HsUbc2bC88A study) or 16 nm (HsUbc2bC88S study), and the concentration of either HsUbc2bC88A or HsUbc2bC88S-125I-ubiquitin oxyester was varied. Maximum velocity in the absence of inhibitor was determined in a parallel incubation containing 1.0 μm wild type HsUbc2b. Confluent cultures of IMR90, A549, and Caco-2 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a constant atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 5 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. Two days after the addition of fresh supplemented medium, triplicate 100-mm plates were washed three times with 10 ml of 25 mmphosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and then harvested by scraping into 0.5 ml of ice-cold homogenizing buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose, and 1 mmDTT. Cells were then lysed by brief sonication and clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g. Thiolester assays of a 50-μl final volume containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm DTT, 10 IU/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 μm125I-ubiquitin, 68 nm rabbit liver E1, and varying amounts of cell extract were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before quenching with an equal volume of SDS sample buffer from which β-mercaptoethanol had been omitted. An aliquot of each sample was adjusted to 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol then boiled for 5 min to correct for limited conjugate formation during the incubation. All samples were then resolved from free 125I-ubiquitin by 12% SDS-PAGE. Bands corresponding to E1- and Ubc2-125I-ubiquitin thiolester were excised from dried gels and the associated radioactivity quantitated by γ counting (29Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Google Scholar). Incubation of the E1 ternary complex with an equimolar concentration of E2 results in rapid stoichiometric transthiolation to form the corresponding E2-ubiquitin thiolester (29Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Google Scholar, 34Haas A.L. Bright P.M. Jackson V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13268-13275Google Scholar). In principle, the dependence of initial rate for E2-ubiquitin thiolester formationversus HsUbc2b concentration can be used to examine the kinetics of ubiquitin transfer in the key step linking the half-reactions of ubiquitin activation and ligation under conditions for which [E1]o ≪ [HsUbc2b]o (35Segal I.A. Enzyme Kinetics. Wiley-Interscience, New York1975Google Scholar). However, preliminary range studies in which [E1]o was decreased at a constant HsUbc2b concentration of 1 μmrevealed a progressive decline in the end point formation of E2 thiolester, as illustrated in Fig.1 A. At 34 nmrabbit reticulocyte E1 (closed circles), the final amount of HsUbc2b thiolester formed was 90% of that determined from a parallel incubation for which E1 and HsUbc2b were present at equivalent concentrations of 1 μm (dashed line), whereas at 0.7 nm activating enzyme the end point for HsUbc2b thiolester formation was 45% of that predicted (open circles). At still lower concentrations of E1 we consistently observed an end point for HsUbc2b-125I-ubiquitin thiolester formation only about 50% of the stoichiometric amount found at equimolar E1 and HsUbc2b (dashed line). Nonstoichiometric transthiolation is a function of the [HsUbc2b]o/[E1]o ratio rather than a concentration-dependent change in oligomerization state of the activating enzyme because the predicted amount of HsUbc2b-125I-ubiquitin thiolester was formed when incubations contained 0.7 nm E1 but only 54 nmHsUbc2b (Fig. 1 B). Because the E1 present in these incubations formed the expected amount of ternary complex even at high [HsUbc2b]o/[E1]o ratios (not shown), the results of Fig. 1 were not the result of inhibition of E1-catalyzed steps by the E2 isozyme. However, the data suggest that the nonstoichiometric formation of the high energy HsUbc2b intermediate results from equilibration between the E1 ternary complex and HsUbc2b-ubiquitin thiolester at high [E2]o/[E1]o ratios, particularly because previous studies have shown that transthiolation is readily reversible (29Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13258-13267Google Scholar, 34Haas A.L. Bright P.M. Jackson V.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13268-13275Google Scholar). This conclusion is supported by subsequent control experiments demonstrating that high concentrations of HsUbc2bC88A or HsUbc2bC88S-ubiquitin oxyester inhibited the rate but not the final end point for wild type HsUbc2b-125I-ubiquitin thiolester formation (not shown). Although the stoichiometry of E2-ubiquitin thiolester formation is underestimated at high [HsUbc2b]o/[E1]o ratios, the kinetics of transthiolation can be quantitated for the isolated activation half-reaction by measuring the initial rate for approach to equilibrium in the absence of ligase (36Jencks W.P. Catalysis in Chemistry and Enzymology. McGraw-Hill Book company, New York1969Google Scholar). At 0.7 nm E1, initial rates for HsUbc2b-125I-ubiquitin thiolester formation determined during the first 1.5 min followed hyperbolic kinetics below 0.5 μm HsUbc2b, as shown by the linearity of the corresponding reciprocal plot (Fig. 2). Hyperbolic kinetics requires the initial formation of a Michaelis complex between uncharged HsUbc2b and the E1 ternary complex prior to intramolecular transthiolation. Nonlinear least squares fitting of the data in Fig. 2 within the linear region of the reciprocal plot yielded a Km of 102 ± 13 nm for HsUbc2b binding and a k cat of 4.8 ± 0.2 s−1, the latter value being calculated asV max/[E1]o. At the highest concentrations of HsUbc2b tested, the initial rates for thiolester formation consistently exhibited substrate inhibition (Fig.2). This was not a consequence of underestimatingv o because rates were linear over at least three time points encompassing the first 1.5 min of the reactions. Linearity during the measurement interval for the kinetic studies also ruled out equilibration of the E1 ternary complex with HsUbc2b-125I-ubiquitin thiolester observed in Fig. 1, although an equilibrium end point was reached at longer incubation times (not shown). We have subsequently observed analogous substrate inhibition with members of other E2 families (not shown), including the rabbit Ubc8 ortholog E220K (37Wefes I. Kaiser P. Schneider R. Pickart C.M. Finley D. Gene (Amst .). 1995; 163: 321-322Google Scholar) and the human Ubc4/5 orthologs HsUbc5A/B/C (38Jensen J.P. Bates P.W. Yang M. Vierstra R.D. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30408-30414Google Scholar). Substrate inhibition of E1-catalyzed transthiolation is consistent with either of two models. In the most plausible model, uncharged E2 can bind two distinct conformations of the E1 ternary complex for which one bound conformer (presumably of lower affinity than the productive binding complex) represents a dead end species. An alternative model in which the E2 carrier protein forms a nonproductive alternate conformation having a low affinity for the E1 ternary complex is much less likely because NMR studies find that the E2 core domain fold is relatively static (39Miura T. Klaus W. Gsell B. Miyamoto C. Senn H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 213-228Google Scholar). The previous transthiolation assay monitored rates of HsUbc2b-125I-ubiquitin thiolester directly. H"

In this study, we adopted a newly developed protocol that provides independent estimates of the binding and unbinding rate constants of GTX (k on andk off) to GTX sites on the sodium channel protein, important in the molecular analysis of channel modification. Novel GTX sites were determined in D2S6 (Asn-784) and D3S6 (Ser-1276) by means of site-directed mutagenesis; the results suggested that the GTX receptor consists of the S6 transmembrane segments of four homologous domains facing the ion-conducting pore. We systematically introduced at two sites in D4S6 (Nav1.4-Phe-1579 and Nav1.4-Tyr-1586) amino acid substituents with residues containing hydrophobic, aromatic, charged, or polar groups. Generally, substitutions at Phe-1579 increased both k onand k off, resulting in no prominent change in dissociation constant (K d). It seems that the smaller the molecular size of the residue at Nav1.4-Phe-1579, the larger the rates ofk on and k off, indicating that this site acts as a gate regulating access of toxin molecules to a receptor site. Substitutions at Tyr-1586 selectively increased k off but had virtually no effect onk on, thus causing a drastic increase inK d. At position Tyr-1586, a hydrophobic or aromatic amino acid side chain was required to maintain normal sensitivity to GTX. These results suggest that the residue at position Tyr-1586 has a more critical role in mediating GTX binding than the one at position Phe-1579. Here, we propose that the affinity of GTX to Nav1.4 sodium channels might be regulated by two residues (Phe and Tyr) at positions Phe-1579 and Tyr-1586, which, respectively, control access and binding of GTX to its receptor.

Biological toxins that act selectively on the voltage-dependent sodium channels have been used to elucidate molecular mechanisms of sodium channel gating processes. Batrachotoxin (BTX), 1The abbreviations used are: BTX, batrachotoxin; D, domain; GTX, grayanotoxin; I Na, Na+ current; I-V, current-voltage; S, segment; RCC, relative chord conductance grayanotoxin (GTX), veratridine, and aconitine, classified as Site 2 toxins (1Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1980; 20: 15-43Google Scholar), are endowed with some characteristics in common (2Seyama I. Narahashi T. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Physiol. 2000; 439: 349-355Google Scholar); 1) they bind to the sodium channel in its open state, 2) the modified sodium channel lacks the inactivation process, and 3) the activation potential of the modified sodium channel is shifted in the direction of hyperpolarization. Among the well characterized toxins, GTX has distinct advantages in that the relevant interaction sites on the GTX molecule with the sodium channel are known as a result of extensive analyses of its structure-activity relationship (6Masutani T. Seyama I. Narahashi T. Iwasa J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1981; 217: 812-819Google Scholar, 7Tsuji K. Kawanishi T. Handa S. Kamano H. Iwasa J. Seyama I. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

The methyl group of the β-surface of the molecule at C-10 and the hydroxyl groups of its β-surface at C-3, C-5, and C-6 are essential to the pharmacological action of GTX and the hydrophobic microenvironment of the α-surface, of which C-14S is most critical, greatly contribute to increased GTX potency (see Fig.2 A). Moreover, the GTX action has a unique dependence on the state of the sodium channel; although BTX binds to and dissociates from the channel in its open state (9Li H.L. Hadid D. Ragsdale D.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 905-912Google Scholar), GTX binds only to the open channel and dissociates from the closed channel (10Yuki T. Yamaoka K. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 777-790Google Scholar). The main structural component of sodium channels is the pore-forming α-subunit, whose molecular mass is more than 250 kDa. The α-subunit consists of four homologous domains (D1-D4), each containing six α-helical transmembrane segments (S1-S6) (11Catterall W.A. Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Google Scholar, 12Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Google Scholar). The regions between S5 and S6 in each of the four domains form pore loops that dip into the membrane to create a narrow selectivity filter at the external end of the ion-conducting pore. The remainder of the pore is formed by each S6 segment of the four domains in close apposition to one another (13Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Google Scholar, 14Lipkind G.M. Fozzard H.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8161-8170Google Scholar). Recent site-directed mutagenesis studies show that specific amino acid residues within each of the four S6 segments are important determinants of action of Site 2 toxins (15Wang S.Y. Barile M.

Previously, we reported that D1S6 and D4S6 segments (but not D2S6 and D3S6) are required for GTX binding to the sodium channel (19Kimura T. Yamaoka K. Kinoshita E. Maejima H. Yuki T. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 865-872Google Scholar, 20Kimura T. Kinoshita E. Yamaoka K. Yuki T. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 18-22Google Scholar, 21Ishii H. Kinoshita E. Kimura T. Yakehiro M. Yamaoka K. Imoto K. Mori Y. Seyama I. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1999; 49: 457-461Google Scholar). Unexplored GTX sites in D2 and D3 have been examined in this study. Within these segments, a number of putative binding sites on the rat skeletal muscle sodium channel isoform, Nav1.4 (Ile-433, Asn-434, Leu-437, Ile-1575, Phe-1579, and Tyr-1586), may interact with the α-surface of the GTX molecule, whose pharmacological action is effected within a hydrophobic microenvironment (8Yakehiro M. Yamamoto S. Baba N. Nakajima S. Iwasa J. Seyama I. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1993; 265: 1328-1332Google Scholar). Residue Tyr-1586 in D4S6 has been found to provide a unique binding site for GTX, which excludes BTX and veratridine. Moreover, we have attributed the difference in GTX sensitivity of the sodium channel isoforms, Nav1.4, and the rat cardiac channel, Nav1.5, to a critical residue (Ser-251) in the intracellular linker of D1S4-S5 (19Kimura T. Yamaoka K. Kinoshita E. Maejima H. Yuki T. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 865-872Google Scholar). Kimura et al. (19Kimura T. Yamaoka K. Kinoshita E. Maejima H. Yuki T. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 865-872Google Scholar) deduced particular GTX binding sites by making several chimeras targeting the heterologous amino acid residues of Nav1.4 and Nav1.5; these chimeras showed reduced sensitivity to GTX. Most recently, Maejimaet al. (24Maejima H. Kinoshita E. Yuki T. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. Yamaoka K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 452-457Google Scholar) found novel binding sites both in D1S4-S5 and D4S4-S5 linkers of Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 through an alanine-scanning method. Recently, Yuki et al. (10Yuki T. Yamaoka K. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 777-790Google Scholar) developed a novel method to evaluate the sensitivity of sodium channels to GTX; this method independently determines the binding and unbinding rate constant (k on and k off) of GTX to sodium channels. The sensitivity of sodium channels to GTX is indicated by the dissociation constant (K d), i.e.the ratio of k off to k on. Here, using this new technique, we reevaluated already-known GTX sites, hoping to uncover novel roles of these sites in GTX binding. At the sites in D4S6, we made systematic amino acid substitutions to further clarify their roles in more detail. Point mutants of the sodium channel were constructed using the cDNA clone encoding the rat skeletal muscle sodium channel α-subunit, Nav1.4 (25Trimmer J.S. Cooperman S.S. Tomiko S.A. Zhou J.

To construct the mutants by substitutions with various amino acids, we followed a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method as described previously (19Kimura T. Yamaoka K. Kinoshita E. Maejima H. Yuki T. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 865-872Google Scholar, 20Kimura T. Kinoshita E. Yamaoka K. Yuki T. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 18-22Google Scholar, 21Ishii H.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1457-1463Google Scholar). All of the resulting mutants were confirmed with restriction mapping and sequencing using an ABI PRISMTM 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The constructed point-mutated cDNA clones were inserted into a mammalian expression vector pCI-neo (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) or pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and were then transiently co-transfected with CD8 cDNA into HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney) cells using the SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The cells were grown to 50% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), 30 units/ml penicillin G (Meiji Corp., Tokyo, Japan), and 30 μg/ml streptomycin (Meiji Corp.) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. The transfected cells were used for electrophysiological experiments as late as 3–4 days after being replated in 35-mm tissue culture dishes. Transfection-positive cells were identified by Immunobeads (CD8-Dynabeads, Dynal, Oslo, Norway) before Na+ current (I Na) recording. MacroscopicI Na from the transfected cells was measured using the whole-cell patch clamp method. The bath solution contained 70 mm NaCl, 67 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 1 mmCaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The pipette solution contained 70 mm CsF, 60 mm CsCl, 12 mm NaF, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mmHEPES, pH 7.4. To assess the effects of GTX on whole-cellI Na, 300 μm GTX I (a GTX analogue) was added to the pipette solution because GTX is known to act intracellularly (27Seyama I. Yamada K. Kato R. Masutani T. Hamada M. Biophys. J. 1988; 53: 271-274Google Scholar), and this concentration is sufficient to evaluate sensitivity of the mutated channels to GTX (19Kimura T. Yamaoka K. Kinoshita E. Maejima H. Yuki T. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 865-872Google Scholar). Because GTX binds to sodium channels exclusively in their open state (10Yuki T. Yamaoka K. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. J.

Yamaoka K. Furue T. Mori Y. Imoto K. Seyama I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 692-700Google Scholar), repetitive depolarizing pulses were applied to induce GTX modification. After these repetitive conditioning pulses, test pulses to various membrane potentials induced a characteristic sustained current (Fig.1, A2, B2, andC2). Without repetitive prepulses, the majority of channels were unmodified by GTX so that the recorded currents in the presence of 300 μm GTX (in the internal medium) exhibited the typical behavior of unmodified channels. However, closer examination revealed a residual non-inactivating component, indicating that a very small fraction of the channels was modified during the test pulse itself without repetitive preconditioning pulses (Fig. 1, A1,B1, and C1). To permit comparison of data from different cells, we standardized the currents by computing their maximum chord conductance from current-voltage curves (19Kimura T. Yamaoka K. Kinoshita E.

The I-V relationships for unmodified I Na through wild type Nav1.4 channels and its mutant forms 2Each mutant channel will be referenced by the original amino acid followed by its number and introduced amino acid. (Nav1.4-F1579A and Nav1.4-Y1586A) are given in Fig. 1, A3,B3, and C3. The continuous line was fitted to peak I Na at membrane potentials from 0 to +60 mV, and the chord conductance was estimated from the slope. For GTX-modified currents, application of 100 conditioning pulses evoked an entirely different family of sustained currents through modified sodium channels (Fig. 1, A2, B2, and C2). Modified I Na at the end of a 160-ms test pulse was plotted against the membrane potential, and the chord conductance of the modified channel population was estimated from the slope of the I-V relationship between −50 and +50 mV (dashed line in Fig. 1, A3, B3, and C3). We routinely used the ratio of maximal chord conductances of GTX-modified to unmodified channels as a measure of channel sensitivity to GTX modification, which is referred to as the relative chord conductance (RCC). Our previously reported RCC values for wild type Nav1.4 and various mutant channels have been provided for comparison with present results in Table I. As for the F1579A mutant, our previously reported RCC value of 0.75 (20Kimura T. Kinoshita E. Yamaoka K. Yuki T. Yakehiro M. Seyama I.

In our previous studies, it was confirmed that Ile-433, Asn-434, and Leu-437 in D1S6 and Ile-1575, Phe-1579, and Tyr-1586 in D4S6 of sodium channels were critical sites for GTX modification (19Kimura T. Yamaoka K. Kinoshita E. Maejima H. Yuki T. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 865-872Google Scholar, 20Kimura T. Kinoshita E. Yamaoka K. Yuki T. Yakehiro M. Seyama I.

Recently, it was reported that Asn-784 and Leu-788 in D2S6 and Ser-1276 and Leu-1280 in D3S6 of Nav1.4 were important in BTX action (15Wang S.Y. Barile M. Wang G.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1100-1107Google Scholar, 16Wang S.Y. Nau C. Wang G.K. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1379-1387Google Scholar). For this reason we substituted Asn-784 and Leu-788 in D2S6 and Ser-1276 and Leu-1280 in D3S6 of Nav1.4 with Ala or Lys. The resultant RCC values are shown in Table I. RCC values of Nav1.4-N784K in D2S6 decreased from 0.35 to 0 compared with the wild type (Fig.1 D and Table I). Similarly, in D3S6, RCC values of Nav1.4-S1276A and Nav1.4-S1276K also decreased to 0.19 and 0, respectively (Table I). Mutant channels of Nav1.4-N784A, -L788A, -L788K, -L1280A, and -L1280K did not exhibit measurable I Na. Thus, we could confirm that Asn-784 in D2S6 and Ser-1276 in D3S6 are also critical in GTX action, much like their role in BTX action, thus indicating that the sites in all S6 transmembrane segments may cooperatively contribute to GTX binding. GTX sites in Nav1.4 identified in our studies are schematically summarized in Fig.2 B. In a previous communication, we presented a method that enables us to independently measure rate constantsk on and k off for toxin binding and unbinding to sodium channels (10Yuki T. Yamaoka K. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 777-790Google Scholar). GTX modifies sodium channels in proportion to the time integral of the unmodified sodium channel conductance (T oNa; Fig.3 B). TheI GTX-T oNarelationship can be readily obtained sinceT oNa varies as a function of the potential of the three conditioning pulses employed to open unmodified sodium channels (Fig. 3 A). Increment ofI GTX brought about by the three conditioning pulses is plotted against integrated currents evoked by the three conditioning pulses divided by the driving force (Fig. 3 B). The slope of the observed linear relationship (Fig. 3 B) gives k on according to Equation 1 (see Yukiet al. (10Yuki T. Yamaoka K. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 777-790Google Scholar) for further details), IGTX≈C×kon×∫INa×(Etest−ENa)dt=C×kon×ToNaEquation 1 where I GTX represents current through GTX-modified sodium channels, I Na is current through unmodified sodium channels, E test is the voltage applied during test pulses to evokeI GTX, E Na is sodium reversal potential, and C is a constant of 1.61 × 10−3 that is invariant over sodium channel isoforms (19Kimura T. Yamaoka K. Kinoshita E. Maejima H. Yuki T. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 865-872Google Scholar) and derived from sodium channel properties such as single channel conductance and open probability of unmodified or GTX-modified sodium channels. Briefly, numbers of GTX-modified sodium channels change according to Equation 2 because GTX only binds to open state of the sodium channel, dG*dt=[GTX]×kon×O−koff×G*Equation 2 G*=IGTX(Etest−ENa)×gGTX×PoGTXEquation 3 O=INa(Econd−ENa)×gNaEquation 4 where O and G* represent the number of open unmodified and GTX-modified sodium channels, respectively, [GTX] is the concentration of GTX,g Na and g GTX are the single channel conductances of unmodified and GTX-modified sodium channels, respectively, Po GTX is the open probability of GTX-modified sodium channels, andE cond is the voltage applied during conditioning pulses to induce GTX-modification. Because G* andO can be obtained from experimental data using Equations 3and 4, Equations 2, 3, and 4 can be combined and solved forI GTX to yield Equation 5, IGTX=C×kon×ToNa−koff×∫IGTXdtEquation 5 However, because best-fitting values ofk off were negligible compared with the termC × k on (i.e. k off = 0.046 and C × k on = 6.24 in the presence of 300 μm GTX (10Yuki T. Yamaoka K. Yakehiro M. Seyama I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 777-790Google Scholar)), we simplified Equation 5 to Equation 1 by setting k off = 0, which thus provides an acceptable estimate of I GTX. In fact, a linear relationship between T oNa andI GTX, passing through the origin, is invariably obtained (Fig. 3 B). To obtain k off we measured the decay time constant of I GTX at a potential of −80 mV (Fig.3 C). At this potential, unmodified sodium channels will not open, and hence, no further channel modification can occur. At the same time, because GTX-modified channels do not inactivate and in fact maintain a constant open probability at this potential, decay ofI GTX can only represent dissociation of GTX from its binding site. Thus, the reciprocal of this time constant can be regarded as k off. Technically, it is impossible to measurek on and k off in mutant channels that have no sensitivity to GTX. Thus, we measuredk on and k off of the mutant channels whose sensitivity was decreased partially, and data are summarized in Table I and Fig. 4. As an overview, these data have four prominent features. 1) Mutations at Phe-1579 give the largest effect on k on. 2) Mutations at Tyr-1586 give the largest effect onk off. 3) The change ink off produced by mutations at Phe-1579 are balanced by the change in k on, resulting in relatively constant K d. 4) Mutations at Tyr-1586 have relatively minor effects on k on, resulting in a significant increase in K d. These data indicate that association and dissociation of GTX with its binding site must be governed by different molecular entities. As described above, we found that k on was increased most markedly by mutations at Phe-1579 and k off was increased most markedly by mutations at Tyr-1586. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that Phe-1579 and Tyr-1586 have particularly important roles in GTX binding. We introduced systematic mutations at these sites using substituent amino acids with hydrophobic, aromatic, charged, and polar side groups. Specifically, we substituted Phe-1579 with Lys, Ser, Gly, Ala, His, Cys, Met, Val, Tyr, and Trp and substituted Tyr-1586 with Glu, Lys, Ser, Gln, Ala, Cys, Met, Ile, Phe, and Trp. We could not detect measurable I Na in mutations F1579E, F1579Q, F1579I, F1579L, F1579P, Y1586D, Y1586R, Y1586N, Y1586T, Y1586H, and Y1586P. Resultant RCC,k on, k off, andK d values are summarized in TableII. k on,k off, and K d values normalized to those of the wild type Nav1.4 are also graphically displayed in Fig. 4. The order of amino acids presented is based on the degree of hydrophobicity (29Nozaki Y. Tanford C. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 2211-2217Google Scholar, 30Levitt M. J. Mol.

Only one mutant of Y1586K in the systematic substitution experiment lost the sensitivity to GTX, so that k on andk off could not be estimated.Table IIRCC, kon, koff, and Kd in point mutants of Nav1.4 at Phe-1579 or Tyr-1586Wild type/mutantMean ± S.D. of RCC (no. of trials)k onk offK dμm−1s −1s−1μmWild type-Nav1.40.35 ± 0.04 (n = 9)2-aReported in Kimura et al.

Open table in a new tab NA means that the GTX modification was so small that it was not available to measure relative chord conductance,k on, or k off. In mutating Phe-1579, we could not correlate the observed changes ink on and k off with side chain properties of amino acids such as their hydrophobic, aromatic, or polar nature or their ionic charge. However, we did find a prominent increase in k on especially with amino acid substituents having small side chains (Gly, Ala, Ser, and Cys). Large molecular dimension or ionic charge of side chains might be a hindrance to GTX binding at Phe-1579."

Schwann cells express the LPA receptors (Edg receptors), which, once activated, have the potential to signal through Gαi to activate p21ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, through Gαq to activate phospholipase C, or through Gq12/13 to activate the Rho pathway. We found that the addition of serum or LPA to serum-starved Schwann cells rapidly (10 min) induced the appearance of actin stress fibers via a Rho-mediated pathway. Furthermore, LPA was able to rescue Schwann cells from apoptosis in a Gαi/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/MEK/MAPK-dependent manner. In addition, LPA increased the expression of myelin protein P0 in Schwann cells in a Gαi-independent manner but dependent on protein kinase C. By means of pharmacological and overexpression approaches, we found that the novel isozyme protein kinase Cδ was required for myelin P0 expression. Thus, the multiple effects of LPA in Schwann cells (actin reorganization, survival, and myelin gene expression) appear to be mediated through the different G protein-dependent pathways activated by the LPA receptor.

In the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells (SCs) 1The abbreviations used are: SC, Schwann cell; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositaol 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; PTX, pertussis toxin; PKC, protein kinase C; AdV, adenovirus; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ROCK, Rho kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase form the myelin sheath and play a key role in the maintenance of the normal physiological function of the axon (1Gould R.M. Jessen k.R. Mirsky R. Tennekoon G. The Cell of Schwann: An Update. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 123-171Google Scholar). The majority of SCs originate from neural crest cells under the guidance of axonal cues that regulate the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of precursor cells into myelin-forming cells (1Gould R.M. Jessen k.R. Mirsky R. Tennekoon G. The Cell of Schwann: An Update. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 123-171Google Scholar). During differentiation, SCs make contact with a single axon, become spindle-shaped, and then form a myelin sheath that contains specific proteins such as myelin P0protein (2Fernandez-Valle C. Gorman D. Gomez A.M. Bunge M.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 241-250Google Scholar). The survival and differentiation of SCs are regulated by extracellular cues from axons and the extracellular matrix (3Aguayo A.J. Peyronnard J.M. Terry L.C. Romine J.S. Bray G.M. J. Neurocytol. 1976; 5: 137-155Google Scholar, 4Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 883: 109-115Google Scholar, 5Bunge M.B. Bunge R.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Some of these factors are lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), β-neuregulin, and insulin-like growth factor-I for SC survival; β-neuregulin, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and tumor growth factor-β for SC proliferation; and tumor growth factor-β and jagged/delta for regulating myelin gene expression (7Weiner J.A. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5233-5238Google Scholar, 8Grinspan J.B. Marchionni M.A. Reeves M. Coulaloglou M. Scherer S.S. J.

Stroobant P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1353-1360Google Scholar). The factors that regulate SC survival do so through activation of Akt and MAPK signaling pathways, whereas actin reorganization is regulated through the Rho family of GTPase (12Li Y. Tennekoon G.I. Birnbaum M. Marchionni M.A. Rutkowski J.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 761-767Google Scholar, 13Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Contos J.J. Scherer S.S. Chun J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7069-7078Google Scholar). Additionally, agents that elevate intracellular cAMP levels stimulate myelin gene expression (10Mews M. Meyer M. Glia. 1993; 8: 208-217Google Scholar,14Sobue G. Pleasure D. Science. 1984; 224: 72-74Google Scholar). However, aside from the effects of cAMP on myelin gene expression, there is little information on the signaling pathways involved in regulating myelin gene expression. All peripheral nerves have a blood-nerve barrier that normally excludes large molecules contained in serum from entering the endoneurial space where SCs reside (15Wadhwani K.C. Rapoport S.I. Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 43: 235-279Google Scholar). In some pathological states, this barrier is broken, resulting in the entry of serum into the endoneurial space. Whereas serum promotes SC survival, it also down-regulates myelin gene expression (16Cheng L. Mudge A.W. Neuron. 1996; 16: 309-319Google Scholar). Interestingly, LPA, a normal constituent of serum (concentration varies between 2 and 20 μm), replicates many of the cellular effects of serum that include effects on SC survival (7Weiner J.A. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5233-5238Google Scholar) and actin rearrangement (13Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Contos J.J. Scherer S.S. Chun J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7069-7078Google Scholar). Some of the other effects of LPA include stimulation of platelet aggregation, smooth muscle contraction, stimulation of cell proliferation (fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes), differentiation (keratinocytes, neuroblastoma, and myoblasts), induction of apoptosis (neurons, T cells, and macrophages), collapse of axonal growth cones with retraction of neurites, release of neurotransmitters, inhibition of gap junction communication, induction of focal adhesions, induction of stress fibers, invasion of tumor cells, and regulation of gene expression (17Moolenaar W.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 1-10Google Scholar). The effects of LPA on target cells are mediated by activation of specific G protein-coupled serpentine receptors. The first LPA receptor identified, vzg-1 (ventricular zonegene-1; also termedEdg-2/rec1.3/lp A1) encodes a 41-kDa protein that is widely expressed in mouse tissue with the highest levels seen in embryonic cortex (18Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Google Scholar). In postnatal life, the LPA receptor lp A1/vzg-1 is predominantly expressed in glial cells (mainly oligodendrocytes and SCs) (7Weiner J.A. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5233-5238Google Scholar, 19Weiner J.A. Hecht J.H. Chun J. J. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 398: 587-598Google Scholar). The appearance of thelp A1/vzg-1/Edg-2 receptor in SCs parallels the appearance of myelin formation in developing peripheral nerves and is up-regulated after nerve injury (7Weiner J.A. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5233-5238Google Scholar, 13Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Contos J.J. Scherer S.S. Chun J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7069-7078Google Scholar). Although it is likely thatlp A1/vzg-1/Edg2 receptor is responsible for mediating most of the effects of LPA, SCs fromlp A1−/− mice were able to respond to LPA, indicating that other LPA receptors such aslp A2/Edg4 orlp A3/E7 may be involved in mediating the LPA effects, since SC also expresseslp A2/Edg4 (13Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Contos J.J. Scherer S.S. Chun J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7069-7078Google Scholar). LPA receptors are coupled to at least three different Gα proteins: Gαi, Gαq, and Gα12/13 (20Fukushima N. Chun J. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediators. 2001; 64: 21-32Google Scholar,21Swarthout J.T. Walling H.W. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1978-1985Google Scholar). Activation of Gαq stimulates phospholipase C activity, thereby increasing the amount of diacylglycerol and inositol 3-phosphate. Diacylglycerol, in turn, activates protein kinase C (PKC), whereas inositol 3-phosphate mobilizes intracellular calcium. LPA activation of pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gαidecreases intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase and also induces MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity. LPA activation of Gα12/13 stimulates the Rho pathway, which in turn induces serum response element-mediated transcription, actin cytoskeletal reorganization, and activation of PI3K. Rat SCs undergo apoptosis during normal development. They also undergo apoptosis after nerve injury, in dysmyelinating disease, and during demyelination in experimental allergic neuritis. In vitro, SC apoptosis is observed after serum withdrawal (12Li Y. Tennekoon G.I. Birnbaum M. Marchionni M.A. Rutkowski J.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 761-767Google Scholar, 22Syroid D.E. Zorick T.S. Arbet-Engels C. Kilpatrick T.J. Eckhart W. Lemke G. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2059-2068Google Scholar). Serum, LPA, and β-neuregulin all promote SC survival. In previous studies investigating the signaling pathways responsible for LPA- and β-neuregulin-induced SC survival, PI3K was shown to play a pivotal role, although the relative importance of MAPK and protein kinase B (Akt) in this process is unclear (7Weiner J.A. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5233-5238Google Scholar, 12Li Y. Tennekoon G.I. Birnbaum M. Marchionni M.A. Rutkowski J.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 761-767Google Scholar). Moreover, LPA has been shown to induce actin rearrangement in SCs (13Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Contos J.J. Scherer S.S. Chun J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7069-7078Google Scholar). In this study, we provide evidence that LPA promotes SC survival through a signal transduction pathway involving PTX-sensitive Gαi protein, PI3K, and MAPK. We also demonstrate that LPA, acting through receptorlp A2 /Edg4 and its downstream effector protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ), induces expression of myelin P0 protein and that the Rho pathway regulates the actin cytoskeleton reorganization. These results suggest multiple roles for LPA in SC survival and differentiation. LPA, 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), pertussis toxin (inhibitor of Gαi), and wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor) were obtained from Sigma. PKC inhibitors, bisindolylmaleimide II and rottlerin, were obtained from Calbiochem(23Gschwendt M. Muller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Google Scholar). The MEK inhibitor, PD98059, was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, and PKC inhibitor, Gö6976, were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) (24Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Google Scholar). The Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y27632, was obtained from Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries (Saitama, Japan) (25Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. Narumiya S. Science. 1999; 285: 895-898Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies against phosphorylated MAPK, total MAPK, phosphorylated Akt, and total Akt were obtained from New England Biolabs. Rabbit anti-PKCδ antibody and goat anti-Edg4 antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-Edg2 antibody was fromBIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Rabbit anti-P0 antibody was provided by Dr. Bruce Trapp (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH). Rat Schwann cells were isolated from the sciatic nerves of 2-day-old rat pups using the method described by Brockes et al. (26Brockes J.P. Fields K.L. Raff M.C. Brain Res. 1979; 165: 105-118Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Schwann cells were expanded using 2 μm forskolin and 25 ng/ml recombinant glial growth factor (27Porter S. Clark M.B. Glaser L. Bunge R.P. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3070-3078Google Scholar). Prior to all of the studies, both forskolin and glial growth factor were removed from the cell culture for 1 week. To assess morphological changes in chromatin structure of SCs undergoing apoptosis, attached and floating cells were collected and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.03% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 mm sodium citrate, and 0.014% propidium iodide (Sigma). Cells were examined under a fluorescent microscope at ×400 magnification and scored for cells with normal and condensed chromatin. The data are expressed as a percentage of the cells with condensed chromatin (apoptotic cells). After the different treatment paradigms, SCs were rinsed once with PBS and then with TBS (50 mmTris, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl). Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 nmcalyculin A, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were collected and clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of cell lysates was measured by BCA protein assay (Pierce). 50 μg of cell lysate were then electrophoresed through an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody. The following day, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Bands were visualized by the ECL Western blot detection system (Amersham Biosciences). SCs were transfected with 10 μg of P0CAT reporter plasmid by the calcium phosphate precipitation technique, and exposed to the precipitate for 8 h. Cultures were washed with PBS and incubated with fresh medium. After 24 h, cells were harvested, and the protein concentration of cell lysates was measured by the BCA method (Pierce). CAT activity was determined by the conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to its acetylated product (28Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Google Scholar). Adenovirus (AdV)-expressing dominant negative PKCα and PKCδ were generated as described (29Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7574-7582Google Scholar, 30Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Leskow F.C. Fujii T. Wang Q. Blumberg P.M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Han K.C. Lee J. Marquez V.E. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 645-655Google Scholar). SCs grown in 60-mm dishes were infected with dominant negative PKCδ, dominant negative PKCα, or LacZ adenovirus for 16 h at multiplicities of infection of 300 plaque-forming units/cell in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal bovine serum. Infection of SCs with a multiplicity of infection of 300 plaque-forming units/cell was determined in preliminary studies by maximizing for GFP-expressing cells using GFPAdV. After removal of the virus, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then treated with LPA. 24 h later, the cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer and analyzed. Plasmid containing glutathioneS-transferase-RhoA (V14) was expressed inEscherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (31Miller M.J. Prigent S. Kupperman E. Rioux L. Park S.H. Feramisco J.R. White M.A. Rutkowski J.L. Meinkoth J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5600-5605Google Scholar). The botulinum C3 exoenzyme was purified as described (32Jalink K. van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of the recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and C3 transferase were determined by using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). For microinjection, SCs were plated onto poly-l-lysine (0.1 μg/ml; Sigma)-coated 12-mm diameter circular glass coverslips. The coverslips were scored with a diamond pen to help identify the area where the cells were microinjected. Before microinjection or specific treatment paradigms, the cells were serum-starved for 16–20 h. Cells were visualized using a Zeiss inverted microscope, and microinjections were performed using an Eppendorf microinjector. For each experiment, proteins were injected into the cytoplasm of 100 cells, together with rabbit immunoglobulin (IgG at 4 mg/ml; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) to facilitate identification of the injected cells. SCs were fixed in 10% formalin solution for 15 min at room temperature. After several washes with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated with 0.2 μg/ml TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) and Texas Red-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature and viewed using a Leitz microscope. 21-Nucleotide RNA duplexes with 2-nucleotide (2′-deoxy)thymidine 3′ overhangs directed against nucleotides 419–441 and 1186–1208 of the respective rat Edg2 and mouse Edg4 coding sequences were obtained from Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). GL2 luciferase small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplex was used as a nonspecific siRNA control (Dharmacon Research). The day before transfection, cells were plated onto 60-mm dishes in fresh medium without antibiotics. Transient transfection of siRNAs was carried out using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were treated in 200 nmsiRNA transfection solution (2 ml/dish) for 4 h and then incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Cells were then treated with LPA (10 μm in serum-free medium) for 24 h and harvested. Cells were plated onto 35-mm glass bottom culture dishes (MarTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and transfected with a plasmid carrying a DNA insert encoding for a PKCδ-GFP fusion protein (30Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Leskow F.C. Fujii T. Wang Q. Blumberg P.M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Han K.C. Lee J. Marquez V.E. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 645-655Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Translocation of PKCδ-GFP was monitored under a confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscope (30Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Leskow F.C. Fujii T. Wang Q. Blumberg P.M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Han K.C. Lee J. Marquez V.E. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 645-655Google Scholar). SCs undergo apoptosis upon serum withdrawal, characterized by DNA condensation in the nucleus (Fig. 1 A). About 50% of SCs underwent apoptosis following serum withdrawal for 24 h (Fig. 1 B). The addition of serum to the medium completely prevented apoptosis in SCs. When 10 μm LPA was added to serum-starved SCs, apoptotic cells were dramatically reduced from 45 to 6% (Fig. 1 B). Since LPA is a component of serum, this finding indicates that LPA is an important constituent in serum-induced SC survival. Since the effects of LPA are mediated via its cognate receptor, we examined the effects of different doses of LPA on its survival activity in SCs. LPA prevented SC apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, with the antiapoptotic effect being observed at a concentration as low as 0.1 μm of LPA with a maximal effect being observed at 10 μm (Fig. 1 C). Based on these results, all subsequent experiments in this study were performed with 10 μm of LPA. The role of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways in SC survival has been demonstrated (12Li Y. Tennekoon G.I. Birnbaum M. Marchionni M.A. Rutkowski J.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 761-767Google Scholar, 34Maurel P. Salzer J.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4635-4645Google Scholar, 35Xiao G.H. Jeffers M. Bellacosa A. Mitsuuchi Y. Vande Woude G.F. Testa J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 247-252Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of different signaling pathways in mediating LPA-induced SC survival, several specific inhibitors were used. The selection of the inhibitors used in this study was based on knowledge of the G proteins implicated in LPA signaling. Pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gαi, blocked the antiapoptotic effect of LPA (Fig. 1 B), as did the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY249002 (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, inhibition of MEK by PD98059 also blocked the antiapoptotic effect of LPA (Fig.1 B). Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR that prevents activation of p70 S6 kinase, had no effect on LPA-mediated survival (Fig. 1 B). Of interest, LY249002 in the absence of LPA increased apoptosis (Fig. 1 B), probably due to the inhibition of basal PI3K activity in SCs (12Li Y. Tennekoon G.I. Birnbaum M. Marchionni M.A. Rutkowski J.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 761-767Google Scholar). Furthermore, neither inhibition of PKCδ by rottlerin nor Rho kinase by Y27632 had any effect on the ability of LPA to promote SC survival (data not shown). These results indicate that the survival effect of LPA on serum-starved SCs is mediated in a Gαi/PI3K/MEK/MAPK-dependent manner. To further study the signaling pathways that mediate the survival effect of LPA, MAPK and Akt phosphorylation were measured. LPA stimulated MAPK phosphorylation (activation) in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). Activation of MAPK was maximal at 5 min followed by a decline to basal level by 30 min. LPA also stimulated phosphorylation of Akt with kinetics similar to MAPK; however, the degree of activation as estimated by the amount of phosphorylated Akt was small as compared with MAPK. With continuous exposure of SCs to LPA, a consistent finding was a second peak of activation of MAPK and Akt at 8 and 16 h. The significance of the biphasic activation of the two kinases is unclear. To analyze the relevant signaling pathways leading to activation of mitogen-activated protein and Akt kinases by LPA, several inhibitors were used. LPA-stimulated phosphorylation of MAPK and Akt was partially blocked by pertussis toxin, LY249002, and wortmannin but not by rapamycin (Fig. 2 B). Pretreatment of the cells with PD98059 prevented activation of MAPK while having no effect on activation of Akt (Fig. 2 B). These results, combined with the use of the same inhibitors in the SC survival assays, confirm the importance of the Gαi/PI3K/MAPK pathway in LPA-mediated SC survival. Although MAPK activation is important for LPA-mediated SC survival, we cannot completely exclude a role for Akt in this process. β-Neuregulin (GGF) rescued SCs from apoptosis in an Akt-dependent manner (12Li Y. Tennekoon G.I. Birnbaum M. Marchionni M.A. Rutkowski J.L. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 761-767Google Scholar). However, when we compared β-neuregulin and LPA activation of Akt, there was significantly less activation of Akt by LPA as compared with β-neuregulin (Fig. 2 B). The LPA receptor is expressed in SC during postnatal development of peripheral nerves and parallels the formation of the myelin sheath (7Weiner J.A. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5233-5238Google Scholar). To demonstrate a correlation between LPA signaling and myelination, we examined the effect of LPA on expression of the major myelin protein, P0. Western blot analysis demonstrated that LPA increased myelin P0 protein levels within 24 h after the addition of LPA (Fig. 3 A). During normal differentiation of SCs, an increase in myelin P0 expression is paralleled by a decrease in p75 nerve growth factor receptor expression. However, LPA did not alter the basal expression of p75 nerve growth factor receptors on SCs (data not shown). Since LPA can alter protein turnover, the increase in myelin P0 protein may simply reflect a decrease in protein turnover. To address this question, transient transfection assays using a plasmid containing the P0 promoter regulating expression of the bacterial CAT gene (pP0cat) were performed. SCs transiently transfected with pP0cat plasmid were treated for 24 h with LPA, at which time the cells were harvested, and CAT activity was measured. LPA increased CAT activity by 2-fold as compared with the basal expression of CAT activity (Fig. 3 B), indicating that LPA increased P0 expression from the myelin P0 promoter. Recent studies have identified three G protein-coupled receptors for LPA, Edg2, Edg4, and Edg7. Among them, Edg2 and Edg4 are expressed in SCs (13Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Contos J.J. Scherer S.S. Chun J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7069-7078Google Scholar). To identify the Edg receptors mediating LPA-induced P0 expression, we carried out RNA interference study to knock down the expression of a given Edg receptor (36Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with either target-specific siRNA duplexes (for Edg2 or Edg4, respectively) or a nonspecific siRNA control (GL2 luciferase siRNA duplex) (36Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar) or buffer only. Gene silencing was measured by immunoblot analysis. In cells treated with Edg4-specific siRNA for 48 h, there was significant decrease in Edg4 protein expression (Fig. 4 B). A decrease in LPA-induced P0 expression was also observed in cells treated with Edg4-specific siRNA (Fig. 4 C). However, no inhibition in LPA-induced P0 expression was also observed in cells treated with Edg2-specific siRNA (Fig. 4 C), although Edg2 protein expression was down-regulated by such treatment (Fig. 4 A). These results demonstrate a role of LPA receptor Edg4 in mediating LPA induced P0 expression. To elucidate the signaling pathways through which LPA increased P0expression, specific inhibitors were used. Fig.5 A shows that the induction of P0 protein expression by LPA was not inhibited by PTX (200 ng/ml). Instead, PTX enhanced LPA-induced P0 protein levels. The Rock inhibitor Y27632 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 both partially blocked the induction of P0 protein expression. The broadly acting PKC inhibitor, bisindolylmaleimide II, blocked LPA-induced myelin P0 expression. Since SCs express various isoforms of protein kinase C, more selective PKC inhibitors were used to identify the specific isoform of PKC responsible for P0induction (Fig. 5 B). Gö6976, an inhibitor of classical PKCα, -β, and -γ, had no effect on P0 induction, whereas rottlerin, an inhibitor of PKCδ, blocked induction of P0 by LPA. Pretreatment of SCs with 100 nm PMA (for 8 h) to down-regulate PKCs (including PKCδ) also inhibited the induction of P0 expression by LPA (Fig. 5 C). As an index of activation, PKCδ translocation was monitored by transfecting SCs with a plasmid carrying a DNA insert encoding for a PKCδ-GFP fusion protein (30Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Leskow F.C. Fujii T. Wang Q. Blumberg P.M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Han K.C. Lee J. Marquez V.E. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 645-655Google Scholar). When transfected cells were treated with 10 μm of LPA, translocation of PKCδ to the plasma membrane was observed (Fig. 6). To confirm the role of PKCδ in regulating expression of P0in SCs, cells were infected with adenoviruses for kinase-inactive PKCδ or PKCα. These PKCs have been mutated in the ATP-binding site and function as dominant negative mutants (29Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7574-7582Google Scholar, 30Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Leskow F.C. Fujii T. Wang Q. Blumberg P.M. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Han K.C. Lee J. Marquez V.E. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 645-655Google Scholar). Infection of SCs with dominant negative PKCδAdV dramatically decreased LPA induction of P0 expression (Fig. 5 D). In contrast, there were no changes in LPA-induced P0 expression in cells infected with dominant negative PKCαAdV or control LacZAdV. Thus, it appears that the induction of P0 expression by LPA is mainly mediated via PKCδ and that both Rho kinase and MAPK are also likely to be involved in myelin gene expression.Figure 6Effect of LPA on translocation of PKC δ-GFP. SCs were transfected with a plasmid pPKCδ-GFP. 48 h later, cells were treated with 10 μm LPA for the indicated times under a confocal fluorescence laser-scanning microscope. Translocation of PKCδ-GFP fusion protein to focal spots at the plasma membrane was observed after LPA treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload"

Infusion of an integrin ligand (the peptide GRGDSP) into rat hippocampal slices reversibly increased the slope and amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials. This effect was not accompanied by changes in paired pulse facilitation, a test for perturbations to transmitter release, or affected by suppression of inhibitory responses, suggesting by exclusion that alterations to α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors cause the enhanced responses.

This leaves open the possibility that transmitter receptors are tonically regulated by co-localized integrins. The question takes on added significance because of the recent finding that integrin expression is highly differentiated across brain regions as well as between the dendritic domains of individual neurons (16Schuster T. Krug M. Stalder M. Hackel N. Gerardy-Schahn R. Schachner M. J. Neurobiol. 2001; 49: 142-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,21Pinkstaff J.K. Detterich J. Lynch G. Gall C. J.

If integrin binding does affect transmission, then it is likely that this influence will vary significantly across synaptic systems.Previous studies on the contributions of integrins to adult synaptic physiology have been restricted to analyses of long term potentiation (LTP).1 Small peptides and toxins containing the matrix sequence (arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)) recognized by most integrins had little effect on the induction or initial expression of LTP but clearly interfered with its stabilization (25Kramár E.A. Lynch G. Neurocience. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hernandez R.M. Garza J.M. Graves M.E. Martinez J.L.J. LeBaron R.G. Biol.

Whereas function-blocking antibodies against the α5 (27Chun D. Gall C.M. Bi X. Lynch G. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or α3 (30Kramár E.A. Bernard J.A. Gall C.M. Lynch G. Neuroscience. 2002; 110: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) integrin subunits caused partial blockade of consolidation as did reductions in integrin-associated protein (31Chang H.P. Lindberg F.P. Wang H.L. Huang A.M. Lee E.H.Y. Learning Memory. 1999; 6: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), local applications of a mixture containing neutralizing antibodies against integrin subunits α3, α5, and αv caused a complete reversal in LTP (25Kramár E.A. Lynch G. Neurocience. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Integrin effects on plasticity are not restricted to hippocampus or LTP. RGD-containing peptides interfere with rapid limbic kindling (32Grooms S. Jones L. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 231: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and activity-dependent synaptic changes inDrosophila (33Rohrbough J. Grotewiel M.S. Davis R.L. Broadie K. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6868-6878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter case, it was possible to identify the pertinent α integrin subunit (34Grotewiel M.S. Beck C.D. Wu C.F. Greenspan R.J. Nature. 1998; 18: 7847-7855Google Scholar, 35Connolly J.B. Tully T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R386-R389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).While connecting integrins to synaptic operations, the above results do not address the question of whether integrins influence neurotransmitter receptors other than very indirectly through processes mediating LTP consolidation. The experiments described here tested for such effects in adult rat hippocampal slices. The results indicate that integrin binding can increase fast, excitatory synaptic responses and, in addition, provide evidence that they do so by modifying the properties of AMPA-type glutamate receptors.RESULTSEffects of Integrin Ligands on Synaptic ResponsesThe effects of 60-min applications of GRGDSP on fEPSPs recorded in the apical dendrites of hippocampal region CA1 are summarized in Fig.1. Infusions of 1 mm GRGDSP (Fig. 1 A; n = 5) caused a consistent increase in the slope and amplitude of the response beginning at 20–30 min after the start of infusion. This effect on fEPSP slope and amplitude was highly reproducible and produced an average of 17 ± 2.9% (± S.D.) and 20 ± 6.5% increase over baseline by 1 h after the start of infusion, respectively. Similar results were obtained from slices treated with 0.5 mm GRGDSP (Fig.1 B, n = 9). At the end of a 60-min infusion period, mean fEPSP slope and amplitude increased to 18 ± 6.8 and 20 ± 6.9% over baseline, respectively, and were not statistically different from the field responses recorded from slices treated with 1 mm GRGDSP (fEPSP slope, t = 0.12, p = 0.91; amplitude, t = 0.11,p = 0.91; between groups t test). Results using doses of 0.1 (n = 5), 0.01 (n = 6), and 0.001 mm (n = 6) GRGDSP as compared with the reverse-sequence control peptide SDGRG at 0.5 mm(n = 6) are also presented in Fig. 1, C–F. As shown, 0.1 mm GRGDSP produced an observable threshold for RGD-induced increases in fEPSP slope (10 ± 4.6%) and amplitude (10 ± 5.4%). Lower doses of 0.01 and 0.001 mm GRGDSP and the reverse-sequence control peptide SDGRG at 0.5 mm had no detectable influence on synaptic responses (mean fEPSP slope: 0.01 mm GRGDSP = 5 ± 2.3%; 0.001 mm GRGDSP = −2 ± 4.3%; 0.5 mm SDGRG = −2 ± 4.7%; mean amplitude: 0.01 mm GRGDSP = 6 ± 3.1%; 0.001 mmGRGDSP = 2 ± 2.2%; 0.5 mm SDGRG = 3 ± 3.7%). Fig. 1 G summarizes the dose-response data. One-way analysis of variance indicated that there were significant differences between groups infused with GRGDSP and SDGRG (fEPSP slope:F = 18.5, p < 0.0001; amplitude:F = 15.4, p < 0.0001). Post hoc comparisons confirmed that slices perfused with 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mm GRGDSP had significantly greater fEPSP slopes and amplitudes measured 60 min after the start of infusion as compared with slices treated with 0.001 or 0.01 mm GRGDSP or with 0.5 mm SDGRG. The dose range over which GRGDSP was effective in increasing field responses corresponds to that at which it blocks integrin adhesive functions in tissues throughout the body. Also in accord with prior results, GRADSP, a weaker integrin ligand (36Pierschbacher M. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1984; 304: 30-33Crossref Scopus (2837) Google Scholar), was substantially less effective than GRGDSP at all concentrations tested (data not shown).Slices treated with 0.5 or 1 mm GRGDSP were used to test for reversibility of the ligand-induced increases in response size. Pooled data for the two concentrations are summarized in Fig.2. After a 1-h application of the integrin ligand, fEPSP slope and amplitude continued to increase for about 25 min after the start of washout, reaching a peak increase of 22 ± 7.1 and 28 ± 6.4%, respectively. The increase was maintained for an additional 25 min (i.e. ∼50 min after onset of washout), after which a gradual decline became evident. Washout of competitive agonist/antagonists begins within 5–10 min in the slice perfusion system used in the present study; the unusually long washout pattern obtained with GRGDSP is suggestive of a compound that triggers a second messenger system with activation/deactivation times on the order of several minutes.Figure 2GRGDSP induces a lasting enhancement of field EPSPs. After establishing a stable 10-min baseline, GRGDSP (0.5 and 1 mm) was infused for 1 h as indicated by thehorizontal bar; plot shows group mean ± S.E. fEPSP slopes and amplitudes expressed as a percentage of baseline values (n = 5 slices). As shown, both fEPSP slope and amplitude increased steadily to reach maximal values about 20 min after washout of the peptide, before beginning a gradual decline toward baseline, which lasted over 3 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The fast, feed forward inhibitory postsynaptic potential disynaptically activated by the Schaffer-commissural fibers affects the amplitude and waveform of the fEPSP. Changes in these potentials could therefore account for some, although not all, of the GRGDSP-induced increases described above. To test this possibility, slices (n = 4) were treated with the GABA-A receptor antagonist picrotoxin (5 μm) prior to and during infusion of 1 mmGRGDSP. As illustrated in Fig.3 A, picrotoxin did not reduce the effects of the integrin ligand on fEPSP slope (31 ± 8.8%; 30 min post-GRGDSP infusion) and amplitude (41 ± 18.0%; 30 min post-GRGDSP infusion). These increases are as large as or larger than those obtained in the absence of the GABA-A receptor antagonist (see Fig. 2). The traces in Fig. 3, B–D, make the additional point that GRGDSP did not distort the waveform of the fEPSP. In accord with earlier work (37Alger B.E. Nicoll R.A. J. Physiol. 1982; 328: 105-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 38Muller D. Lynch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9346-9350Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), 5 μm picrotoxin prolonged the decay phase of the fEPSP and eliminated the positive wave that follows it (Fig. 3 B). The waveform of the RGD-enhanced response, normalized to base-line amplitudes, was identical to responses recorded during treatment with picrotoxin alone (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3GRGDSP-induced fEPSP waveform changes are not influenced by GABA-A receptors. A, plots of mean ± S.E. slopes and amplitudes of fEPSPs recorded from hippocampal slices (n = 4) perfused with 5 μmpicrotoxin (PTX) for 50 min followed by picrotoxin plus 1 mm GRGDSP for an additional 1 h, after which washout began. As shown, picrotoxin did not interfere with GRGDSP-induced increases in fEPSP slope and amplitude. During washout, fEPSP slope and amplitude reached a maximum of 30 and 40% above baseline values, respectively, before slowly declining. B–D, representative fEPSPs collected during picrotoxin and GRGDSP infusion, showing that waveform changes in GRGDSP-treated slices are not due to GABA-A receptor activities. Each trace shows the average response during a 3-min recording period. B, following a stable baseline, slices were treated with 5 μm picrotoxin for 1 h. The trace on the left is an average field response during baseline recording. The field response in themiddle is an average trace taken in the presence of picrotoxin. On the far right, the two responses are superimposed. Calibration was as follows: 5 ms, 0.25 mV.C, following 1-h infusion of picrotoxin, 1 mmGRGDSP was added to the perfusion medium for an additional 1-h recording period. The trace on the leftrepresents an average field response in the presence of picrotoxin. Normalized for amplitude, the trace in the middleshows an average waveform taken in the presence of picrotoxin plus GRGDSP. At the right, the two traces are shown superimposed. Calibration was as follows: 5 ms, 0.25 mV. D, for comparison, a separate group of slices were treated for 1 h with 1 mm GRGDSP only. The field response on the leftrepresents an average trace during the baseline recording period. Themiddle trace has been normalized for amplitude and shows an average response in the presence of GRGDSP. The two responses are superimposed on the far right. Calibration was as follows: 5 ms, 1 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Increases in the size of synaptic responses with minimal distortion of their waveform, as described above, can be produced by enhancing the probability of transmitter release. Paired pulse facilitation, an effect known to be sensitive to perturbations in neurotransmitter release probability, was used to test the possibility that integrin related changes in response size are due to presynaptic alterations. As shown in Fig. 4, paired pulse facilitation at intervals of 20, 50, 100, and 200 ms was not detectably changed from baseline values following infusion of 0.5 mmGRGDSP (p ≥ 0.2 at all intervals; paired ttest, two-tailed). These data suggest that the molecular mechanisms regulating GRGDSP-induced enhancement in synaptic transmission are postsynaptic.Figure 4GRGDSP does not affect paired pulse facilitation. The graph shows the degree of paired pulse facilitation (initial slope of response measure) expressed as a function of the interpulse interval (20, 50, 100, and 200 ms) for responses recorded before (open circle) and after (closed circle) application of 0.5 mmGRGDSP. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of five separate experiments. Treatment with GRGDSP did not influence the degree of paired pulse facilitation at any interpulse interval tested.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Previous studies established that field EPSPs recorded under conditions described here do not contain significant contributions from NMDA receptors (38Muller D. Lynch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9346-9350Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In accord with this, as shown in Fig.5, infusion of the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX largely blocked synaptic responses and completely prevented GRGDSP-induced increases in field potentials (40 min post-CNQX infusion; mean ± S.D. fEPSP amplitude = 15 ± 1.8% versus 60 min post-GRGDSP + CNQX; mean = 13 ± 0.3%; p = 0.008, paired t test, two-tailed). Moreover, the remaining synaptic response, presumably mediated by the NMDA receptor and insensitive to CNQX infusions (39Muller D. Joly M. Lynch G. Science. 1988; 242: 1694-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), was completely eliminated during the application of 50 μmAP5 (30 min post-AP5 infusion = 2.8 ± 1.5%). This result, combined with those obtained with the GABA-A receptor antagonists and paired pulse facilitation, point to a change in AMPA receptors as the simplest explanation for the GRGDSP-induced increase in fEPSP slope and amplitude.Figure 5The AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX prevents GRGDSP-induced increases in synaptic responses. After recording stable baseline responses, 10 μm CNQX infused into the bath caused a marked reduction in the synaptic response amplitude that reached a plateau by 40 min postinfusion (group means plotted forn = 4 experiments). Infusion of 0.5 mmGRGDSP in the presence of CNQX did not significantly change the remaining field potentials through a 60-min treatment period. The fEPSPs remaining in the presence of CNQX were completely blocked by 50 μm AP5. The inset shows representative field traces recorded (from left to right) (i) during initial baseline recordings, (ii) 40 min after the start of CNQX infusion, (iii) 60 min after application of GRGDSP + CNQX, and (iv) 30 min after infusion of AP5 in the presence of CNQX.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Biochemical Pathways Responsible for Increases in Field EPSPsPharmacological ResultsAs noted, integrins stimulate a number of postsynaptic signaling cascades including those driven by the Src family kinases (40Duong L.T. Rodan G.A. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 47: 174-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 41Girault J.-A. Costa A. Dirkinderen P. Studler J.-M. Toutant M. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 257-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The Src inhibitor PP2 was used to test whether the latter pathways contributed to GRGDSP-induced increases in Schaffer collateral fEPSPs. PP2 (10 μm, n= 6) applied alone had no detectable effect on fEPSPs (percentage change in slope after a 60-min PP2 infusion = −5 ± 5.9%,p > 0.1) but completely blocked the effect of GRGDSP (n = 6) on fEPSP slope (percentage change after 60 min = 1 ± 4.9%; p > 0.2) (Fig.6, A and B). Because Src tyrosine kinases phosphorylate the NMDA receptor NR2A and NR2B subunits (42Hisatsune C. Umemori H. Mishina M. Yamamoto T. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 43Lu W.Y. Xiong Z.G. Lei S. Orser B.A. Dudek E. Browning M.D. MacDonald J.F. Nat.

Neurosci. 2001; 5: 27-33Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar), the findings with PP2 raise the possibility that the GRGDSP-induced increase in fEPSPs is secondary to changes in NMDA receptors. Tests of this were carried using AP5, a competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors. As presented in Fig.7 A, 50 μm AP5 (n = 9) substantially reduced the effect of GRGDSP on synaptic responses: the integrin ligand by itself caused an 18 ± 6.6% increase in the slope after 1 hour of infusion but only a 4 ± 11.6% increase in slices pretreated with AP5. Whereas this difference was statistically robust (t = 7.6;p < 0.0001, between groups t test, two-tailed), AP5 did not completely block the GRGDSP-induced increase in facilitation in three of the nine slices tested.Figure 6Integrin ligand binding effects on synaptic transmission involve Src-tyrosine kinase signaling. A, graph shows the mean ± S.E. fEPSP slope, plotted as percentage change from baseline, for six experiments in which slices were treated with 10 μm PP2 alone. Inset, traces were taken at the time points indicated by the lowercase letters. As shown, PP2 had no significant effect on field responses over the 60-min treatment interval. B, in a separate set of experiments (n = 6), hippocampal slices were treated with 10 μm PP2 for 30 min and then with PP2 plus 0.5 mm GRGDSP. Representative field responses (inset) were taken at the time points indicated bylowercase letters. As shown, PP2 completely blocked GRGDSP effects on fEPSP slope and amplitude. Trace calibration for both panels was as follows: 5 ms, 0.5 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7The NMDA receptor antagonist AP5 markedly attenuates GRGDSP-induced increases in field EPSPs. A, plot of Schaffer collateral fEPSP slopes (mean ± S.E.) in hippocampal slices treated with 0.5 m GRGDSP for 1 h (filled circles; n = 9; group mean values ± S.E. shown) or with the NMDA receptor antagonist, AP5 (50 μm) for 20 min followed by AP5 plus 0.5 mm GRGDSP for 1 h (open circles;n = 9). As shown, AP5 significantly reduced the effects of GRGDSP on fEPSP slope. B, plot of fEPSP slopes (mean ± S.E.) in hippocampal slices (n = 3) treated with 0.5 mm GRGDSP alone for 1 h followed by AP5 alone for 30 min. As shown, the size of field responses did not decline with the addition of 50 μm AP5. Theta Burst patterned stimulation (TBS; 10 bursts at 5 Hz, each composed of four pulses at 100 Hz) was delivered immediately after AP5 infusion to verify that the AP5 dose used was sufficient to block NMDA receptor function and, consequently, the induction of LTP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The above result is as predicted from the hypothesis that activation of NMDA receptors is needed to induce integrin-related increases in AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents. However, while unlikely given their voltage dependence, it is also possible that NMDA receptors contribute directly to the enhanced responses. If so, then infusion of AP5 should at least partially reverse the effects of GRGDSP. As shown in Fig. 7 B (n = 3), this prediction could not be confirmed; AP5 applied at concentrations sufficient to block NMDA receptor-driven operations, as evidenced by the total blockade of LTP normally induced by high frequency bursts of afferent stimulation, did not reverse the effects of GRGDSP on fEPSPs. It is known from several previous studies that GRGDSP does not reduce induction or expression of consolidated potentiation (27Chun D. Gall C.M. Bi X. Lynch G. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 45Staubli U. Vanderklish P.W. Lynch G. Behav.

NeuroReport. 1991; 2: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The results with AP5 emphasize the point that changes in AMPA receptors are likely to be the major cause of GRGDSP-induced increases in field responses. Phosphorylation of AMPA receptors by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is one route whereby their functioning could be enhanced (47Poncer J.C. Esteban J.A. Malinow R. J.

This was tested by infusing the CaMKII inhibitor KN93 (5 μm) for 30 min prior to and during the 1-h infusion of 0.5 mmGRGDSP (n = 6). Fig.8 A shows that KN-93 had no detectable effect on baseline responses but completely blocked the increases in fEPSP slope normally produced by the integrin ligand (change from baseline of −3 ± 4.2%, p > 0.20). In contrast, Fig. 8 B shows that the structural analogue KN-92 (5 μm, n = 4), which lacks CaMKII antagonist activity, had no effect on GRGDSP-induced increases in fEPSP slope (16 ± 5.0%; t = 5.9, p = 0.002, paired t test, two-tailed).Figure 8The CaMKII inhibitor, KN-93, blocks GRGDSP-induced increases in synaptic responses.

Substitution of several aspartate residues by asparagine completely abolished Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting of PKCα. Strikingly, these mutations enabled the mutant proteins to translocate in a diacylglycerol-dependent manner, suggesting that neutralization of charges in the Ca2+ binding region enables the C1 domain to bind diacylglycerol. In addition, it was demonstrated that the protein residues involved in direct interactions with acidic phospholipids play differential and pivotal roles in the membrane targeting of the enzyme.

Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Conventional and novel PKCs share the property of using two membrane-targeting modules for the sensitive, specific, and reversible regulation of their function. Thus, the C1 and the C2 domains are involved in membrane translocation and subsequent enzyme activation (4Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32407-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Many studies performed to date suggest a sequential mechanism in the activation of PKCα by Ca2+ in which membrane association is followed by increased catalytic activity (5Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7624-7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol.

Acta. 2000; 1487: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear whether these domains function in a concerted way or as independent modules. The first step of this process is probably the Ca2+-dependent contact of the C2 domain with negatively charged phospholipids at the plasma membrane (6Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 8Oancea E. Meyer T.

Recent studies on different C2 domains reveal that, despite their sequential and architectural similarity, they are functionally specialized modules that exhibit distinct equilibrium and kinetic behaviors that are probably optimized for different Ca2+-signaling applications (13Nalefski E.A. Wisner M.A. Chen J.Z. Sprang S.R. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3089-4100Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Kohout S.C. Corbalan-Garcia S. Torrecillas A. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11411-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Most of these studies have been performed with isolated C2 domains and, in the case of PKCα, the precise molecular mechanism driving the above interaction and the consequences for the general functioning of the enzyme are still not well defined. Our previous crystallographic studies of the isolated C2 domain of PKCα bound to Ca2+ and the short chain lipid 1,2-dicaproyl-sn-phosphatidyl-l-serine show that two or three Ca2+ ions bind to the domain, with one of them (Ca1) bridging the protein directly to phosphatidylserine (PS). Moreover, several residues in the domain seem to be involved in a direct interaction with PS (15Verdaguer N. Corbalan-Garcia S. Ochoa W.F. Fita I. Gómez- Fernández J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6329-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 16Ochoa W.F. Corbalan-Garcia S. Eritja R. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Fita I. Verdaguer N. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and further studies show that both Ca2+ and PS binding sites are important for in vitro enzyme activation (9Conesa-Zamora P. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Corbalan-Garcia S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Conesa-Zamora P. Lopez-Andreo M.J. Gómez-Fernández J.C.

Chem. 2002; 278: 4971-4980Google Scholar). Whether two or three calcium ions are needed for plasma membrane translocation of PKCα and how PS and diacylglycerol interact with the regulatory domain to orchestrate membrane targeting and activation of PKCα in vivo are key questions that remain to be answered. To investigate the molecular determinants mediating the C2 domain-dependent plasma membrane localization of PKCα, we generated a construct containing full-length PKCα tagged to green fluorescent protein (PKCα-GFP). Additionally, different constructs containing point mutations at the Ca2+ and PS binding sites in the C2 domain of PKCα were produced and transfected into RBL-2H3 cells (a mast cell line that provides a useful model for studying signal transduction mechanisms). The cells are activated by antigens via the tyrosine kinase-dependent high affinity receptor for IgE (FcεRI) to induce the release of secretory granules and the generation of cytokines. Activation of the receptor leads to phospholipase Cγ activation and the consequent generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate/Ca2+ and diacylglycerol, both of which are regarded as PKC activators (19Beaven M.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 798-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using confocal microscopy combined with measurements of intracellular Ca2+ concentration in time-lapse experiments, we have found that both Ca2+ and PS binding sites in the C2 domain play important and differential roles in the spatio-temporal localization of PKCα, suggesting a very accurate and controlled mechanism driven primarily by the C2 domain. N-terminal fusions of rat PKCα and the different mutants to GFP were generated by inserting cDNAs into the multiple cloning site of the pEGFP-N3 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) mammalian expression vector. Briefly, cDNAs encoding PKCα and its mutants D187N, D246N/D248N, D187N/D246N/D248N, N189A, R216A, R249A, and T251A were amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-ATTCTCGAGCTATGGCTGACGTT and 3′-CCGGGTACCTACTGCACTTTGCAAGAT.XhoI/KpnI-digested PKCα and mutated fragments were ligated with theXhoI/KpnI-digested vector, thus generating the different fusion constructs. Further details on site-directed mutagenesis to generate the different mutants are reported by Conesa-Zamora et al. (17Conesa-Zamora P. Lopez-Andreo M.J. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13898-13905Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The stability and viability of the mutated proteins were studied by using specific activity measurements. It was demonstrated that the mutants could be activated in a PS-dependent manner, although not to the same extent as the wild-type protein (9Conesa-Zamora P. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Corbalan-Garcia S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Conesa-Zamora P. Lopez-Andreo M.J. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13898-13905Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, earlier studies have shown that a C-terminal GFP tag does not affect the catalytic activity or the cofactor dependence of PKCα (20Almholt K. Arkhammar P.O. Thastrup O. Tullin S. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Maasch C. Wagner S. Lindschau C. Alexander G. Buchner K. Gollash M. Luft F.C. Haller H.

Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2in a growth medium of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 mm glutamine. Cells were prepared for confocal microscopy as described by Bolsover et al. (23Bolsover S. Ibrahim O. O′Luanaigh N. Williams H. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Basically, harvested cells were resuspended in electroporation buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm KCl, 2.8 mmMgCl2, 25 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) and 30 μg of cDNA. Cells were electroporated in a Bio-Rad GenePulser with two 500-V pulses. The cells were immediately placed on ice for 5 min before being plated on glass coverslips and incubated at 37 °C for 4–6 h, after which the growth medium was renewed. Cells were used 24 h later after priming overnight with 500 ng/ml IgE-anti-dinitrophenyl (mouse monoclonal, Sigma). Coverslips were washed with 3 ml of extracellular buffer HBS (120 mm NaCl, 25 mm glucose, 5.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). All added substances were dissolved or diluted in HBS. DiC8 and ionomycin were dissolved in Me2SO and diluted to the final concentration with extracellular buffer shortly before the experiment. During the experiment, the cells were not exposed to Me2SO concentrations higher than 1%. All the experiments were carried out at room temperature, and unless otherwise stated, on at least four different occasions. In each experiment, recordings were obtained from 2–6 cells. [Ca2+]i was measured using Fura Red (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Stock solutions (2 mm) of the AM-ester form of the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator were made using a solution of 2.5% (w/v) Pluronic F-127 in absolute Me2SO. This stock was diluted 1000-fold in growth medium and applied to cells for 30 min at 25 °C and 5% CO2. After incubation, the cells were washed with HBS and mounted in a holder attached to the stage of a Leica inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope. During imaging, cells were stimulated with antigen (DNP-conjugated human serum albumin (HSA), Sigma) or other agents as described. Fluorescence confocal microscopy was used to monitor both the translocation of EGFP fusion constructs and the intensity of the Ca2+ indicator in response to different stimuli. Cells were illuminated using a 488-nm laser line, and emitted light was simultaneously sampled through a 515–540-nm band pass filter (EGFP channel) and 590-nm long pass filter (Fura Red channel). The signals from Fura Red and EGFP could not be completely separated (23Bolsover S. Ibrahim O. O′Luanaigh N. Williams H. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The same photomultiplier voltages were used throughout these experiments, meaning that the measurements made when only one dye was present were also applicable to dual dye readings. Imaging of untransfected cells loaded with Fura Red revealed minimal contamination of the EGFP channel by the Fura Red signal; because the contamination represented less than 1% of the values recorded when EGFP was present, no correction was performed. In contrast, imaging of transfected cells without Fura Red revealed significant contamination of the Fura Red channel by the signal from EGFP. The signals recorded in the Fura Red channel were closely correlated with those recorded in the EGFP channel and had values 24.7% as large. In the dual dye experiments we therefore calculated the net Fura Red signal in any defined area of interest by subtracting 24.7% of the EGFP signal from the overall signal in the Fura Red channel. [Ca2+]i was then calculated using [Ca2+]i=(Kd(I−Imin)/(Imax−I))Equation 1 where K d is the apparent Ca2+binding affinity of the Ca2+ indicator, determined by the manufacturer (140 nm), I is the net Fura Red fluorescence intensity of an individual cell,I min is the net Fura Red fluorescence intensity of the cell at zero Ca2+, and I maxis net Fura Red fluorescence intensity of the cell at saturating Ca2+. I min was replaced byFI 0, where F = (I min/I 0) = (K d +C r)/(C r S +K d), I 0 is the net Fura Red fluorescence intensity of a resting unstimulated cell, calculated as the average intensity of the first 10 images recorded in each experiment, C r is the Ca2+ concentration in resting unstimulated cells, measured as 136 ± 1 nmin 256 untransfected cells loaded with the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 (see Bolsover et al.(23Bolsover S. Ibrahim O. O′Luanaigh N. Williams H. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)), and S =I max/I min, measured as 0.101 on this instrument. When excited at 488 nm, the fluorescence of Fura Red falls on binding Ca2+. I maxwas replaced by SI min. Substitution ofI min and I max in Equation1 therefore gives [Ca2+]i=(Kd(I−FI0)/(SFI0−1))Equation 2 which was used to convert net Fura Red intensities into Ca2+ values. A series of confocal images were recorded for each experiment at time intervals of 9.3 s. The time series were analyzed using Lucida 4.0 software (Kinetic Imaging, Wirral, UK). An individual analysis of protein translocation for each cell was performed by tracing a line intensity profile across the cell (24Meyer T. Oancea E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 500-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The relative increase in plasma membrane localization of the enzyme for each time point was calculated by using the ratio r = (I mb −I cyt)/I cyt, whereI mb is the fluorescence intensity at the plasma membrane, and I cyt is the average cytosolic fluorescence intensity. Mean values are given ±S.E. 1DSY was used as the Protein Data Bank identifier for the experimentally determined C2 domain structure (15Verdaguer N. Corbalan-Garcia S. Ochoa W.F. Fita I. Gómez- Fernández J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6329-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The program used to visualize the structures was Swiss-PDB Viewer 3.7 program by GlaxoSmithKline (25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9589) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A illustrates a scheme based on the structure of the C2 domain of PKCα bound to three Ca2+ and to the short chain lipid 1,2-dicaproyl-sn-phosphatidyl-l-serine (15Verdaguer N. Corbalan-Garcia S. Ochoa W.F. Fita I. Gómez- Fernández J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6329-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 16Ochoa W.F. Corbalan-Garcia S. Eritja R. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Fita I. Verdaguer N. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The side chains of the five aspartates (Asp-187, Asp-193, Asp-246, Asp-248, and Asp-254) that directly coordinate Ca1 and Ca2 are shown. Simple (D187N), double (D246N/D248N) and triple (D187N/D246N/D248N) mutants were generated to study the role of these residues in the plasma membrane targeting of the enzyme. D187N was chosen because the crystallographic study showed that this aspartate residue forms a bidentate interaction with Ca1, which is the ion involved in bridging the protein residues with the phosphate group of the phospholipid molecule (Fig. 1 A). In the case of the double mutant containing Asp-246 and Asp-248 substituted by Asn, key coordinations with Ca1 and specially with Ca2 were abolished. Double (D246N/D248N) and triple (D187N/D246N/D248N) substitutions of the aspartate residues by Asn neutralized the highly negative charge exhibited by this region, and it was thought that this might help understand whether this neutralization of charges is the only mechanism required for membrane targeting of the domain or a different mechanism operates this interaction. Fig. 1 B shows the side chains of the residues involved in the PS-binding site: Asn-189 (located in loop 1), Arg-216 (located in loop 2), Arg-249 and Thr-251 (both located in loop 3). Thr-251 is a special residue since it has been proposed to be involved in two types of interaction. When the C2 domain only binds two Ca2+, this residue interacts with the sn-1 acyl group oxygen of the PS (15Verdaguer N. Corbalan-Garcia S. Ochoa W.F. Fita I. Gómez- Fernández J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6329-6338Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, when three Ca2+ are bound to the domain, the side-chain oxygen of Thr-251 also coordinates the third Ca2+, which seems to bind to the C2 domain only in the presence of a very short phosphatidylserine analogue (16Ochoa W.F. Corbalan-Garcia S. Eritja R. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Fita I. Verdaguer N. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Whether this third Ca2+ was necessary for PKCα plasma membrane translocation was unclear as was the specific role of the threonine residue. Thus, single substitutions by Ala of each amino acidic residue located in the lipid-binding site were generated to study their role in PKCα membrane localization. When these mutants were studied, all of them exhibited enzyme activity at saturating Ca2+, PS, and diacylglycerol concentrations, demonstrating that the mutations did not significantly disrupt the tertiary structural fold of the mutant proteins (9Conesa-Zamora P. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Corbalan-Garcia S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Conesa-Zamora P. Lopez-Andreo M.J. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13898-13905Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with PKCα -GFP and loaded with Fura Red to monitor protein translocation and [Ca2+]i simultaneously. To analyze the kinetics of the two processes, a series of 63 images were taken at 9.3-s intervals. To determine PKCα translocation, the relative increase in plasma membrane over cytosolic fluorescence intensity (R) was calculated at each time point. Fig. 2 A shows images of antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells expressing PKCα -GFP. In unstimulated cells, the protein was evenly distributed throughout the cytosol (Fig. 2 A, 0 s), whereas stimulation with 40 ng/ml DNP-HSA resulted in oscillatory translocations of PKCα-GFP to and from the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 A, 149, 205, 223, and 279 s). The addition of ionomycin after 381 s also produced plasma membrane translocation (Fig. 2 A, 437). When the time course of Ca2+ oscillations versusthe plasma membrane translocation of PKCα-GFP was compared (Figs.2, B and C), intracellular Ca2+spikes were seen to be highly correlated with the translocation of PKCα-GFP. Maximum protein translocation occurred between 2 and 26 s after the first Ca2+ spike was generated. It is interesting to note that the first Ca2+ spike was more effective in producing the translocation of the protein to the plasma membrane, whereas the second and third pulses, which showed the same Ca2+ concentrations, were only capable of partially anchoring the protein. The addition of ionomycin in the same experiment produced a further increase in cytosolic Ca2+ and a parallel translocation of PKCα-GFP that started to revert to the cytosol 79 ± 23 s after ionomycin addition. It is interesting to note that protein started to revert to the cytosol when the intracellular Ca2+ concentration was still compatible with protein translocation. Similar translocation profiles were obtained in control experiments, in which ionomycin was added directly to the cells without previous antigen stimulation (data not shown). To investigate how the aspartate residues coordinate the different Ca2+ ions and produce the membrane targeting of PKCα, we generated several mutants that were also fused to GFP, as stated above. As shown in Fig. 3 A, all the mutants were localized homogeneously in the cytosol in unstimulated cells. When the cells were stimulated by the addition of 40 ng/ml DNP-HSA, no changes in plasma membrane translocation of the mutant proteins were detected; similar results were obtained when ionomycin was added. A comparison of Fig. 3, B and C, clearly illustrates that although Ca2+ spikes were generated in the cells transfected with the different mutant proteins, these mutations strongly affected the Ca2+-dependent translocation of the enzyme (Fig. 3 C). Additionally, none of the mutant proteins translocated to the plasma membrane, although sustained cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations ranging from 900 to 1400 nmwere produced in the cells analyzed by the addition of ionomycin. Taken together these data suggest that the initial physiological translocation of PKCα to the plasma membrane is driven primarily in a Ca2+-dependent manner by the C2 domain and that the residues coordinating Ca1 and Ca2 are critical in the in vivo protein-plasma membrane interaction. To determine the role of the C1 domain in the Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting of PKCα, we examined the direct effect of increasing concentrations of the membrane-permeant diacylglycerol (DiC8) on both cytosolic Ca2+ and the kinetics of PKCα-GFP translocation. Neither the Ca2+ signal nor PKCα-GFP targeting of the plasma membrane was produced by increasing the concentrations of DiC8 alone (Fig. 4, A and B). Only when ionomycin was added to the medium did the protein translocate to the membrane in a DiC8 concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B). In fact, the higher the DiC8 concentration, the longer the residence time of PKCα at the plasma membrane. It is interesting to note that the protein translocation profile obtained after the addition of ionomycin to the medium containing 10 μg/ml DiC8 was very similar to that obtained when the cells were stimulated previously with 40 ng/ml antigen (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that the concentration of diacylglycerol generated under physiological conditions might also be similar but probably only sufficient to anchor the protein to the plasma membrane for a very short length of time through the C1 domain, as has been suggested in previous reports (8Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar,26Tanimura A. Nezu A. Morita T. Hashimoto N. Tojyo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29054-29062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because the C1 and C2 domains have always been considered as independent modules, it is striking that the effect of DiC8 is only observed when the concentration of intracytosolic Ca2+increases. The results obtained with the Ca2+ binding mutants shed light on this issue. When the cells transfected with PKCα D187N mutant were stimulated with increasing concentrations of DiC8, no protein translocation was observed (n = 20 cells). However, when ionomycin was added (Fig.5 A) the mutant interacted with the plasma membrane only in 50% of the cells analyzed with a rate (R) of 0.6. Note, also, that after ionomycin stimulation the translocation profiles reflected a slower and more transient process compared with that of the wild-type protein that lasted at least 186 s with the same concentration of DiC8 (100 μg/ml). Moreover, maximum protein translocation of PKCα D187N mutant was obtained 123 ± 11 s after ionomycin addition, whereas wild-type protein showed maximum translocation after 55 ± 10 s. Surprisingly, when the cells were transfected with the PKCα D246N/D248N mutant (Fig. 5 B), the protein started to translocate slowly to the plasma membrane after the addition of 50 or 100 μg/ml DiC8. This effect was clearly concentration-dependent since 25 μg/ml DiC8 only produced a transient translocation after ionomycin stimulation, whereas 50 and 100 μg/ml DiC8 promoted the irreversible plasma membrane localization of the protein that was detectable after 115 ± 18 s (n = 8 cells). Note also that measurable levels of PKCα D246N/D248N mutant were recorded after 58 ± 4 s in the presence of ionomycin when the cells were previously stimulated with 25 μg/ml DiC8 compared with the 86 ± 4 s needed in the case of PKCα D187N mutant. Furthermore, the translocation of PKCα D246N/D248N to the plasma membrane became almost independent of ionomycin addition when 50 and 100 μg/ml DiC8 were used to stimulate the cells. When PKCα D187N/D246N/D248N mutant (Fig. 5 C) was tested, it was translocated to the plasma membrane at only 25 μg/ml DiC8, and it showed a faster kinetics (68 ± 5 s; n = 13 cells) of translocations than PKCα D246N/D248N mutant. These results demonstrate a strong correlation between the degree of neutralization of the aspartate residues that coordinate the Ca2+ ions and the accessibility of DiC8 to the C1 domain. We also generated point mutations of the residues involved in the PS-binding site; Asn-189, Arg-216, Arg-249, and Thr-251 were mutated to Ala and fused to GFP. It is important to note that all these constructs exhibited a very similar degree of Ca2+-dependent activation to the wild-type protein except Thr-251, which showed a slightly decreased Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent activation (17Conesa-Zamora P. Lopez-Andreo M.J. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13898-13905Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When those constructs were transfected into RBL-2H3 cells, all of them were expressed and uniformly distributed in the cytosol in resting conditions, except the PKCα R249A mutant, which was also localized in the nucleus (Fig. 6 A). Fig. 6,B and C, illustrate how PKCα N189A and PKCα R216A mutants partially translocated to the plasma membrane upon antigen stimulation. However, there were two significant differences compared with the wild-type protein. First, the delay before maximum translocation ranged between 31 and 53 s for PKCα N189A and between 30 and 74 s for PKCα R216A, whereas the wild-type protein only needed 2–26 s; second, the mutated proteins only translocated once after the first Ca2+ spike, none of the other Ca2+ spikes producing plasma membrane translocation of these two mutants. Furthermore, when ionomycin was added, intracellular Ca2+ concentrations increased to 1000 nm or above in all cells (Fig. 6 B), and the localization profiles of PKCα N189A and PKCα R216A showed a very transient process compared with that seen in the case of the wild-type protein. In particular, the half-maximal plasma membrane dissociation time of PKCα N189A mutant was 73 ± 9 s and of PKCα R216A mutant was 76 ± 16 s compared with the wild-type PKCα of 108 ± 12 s, suggesting that these mutations produce a slight alteration in the Ca2+-dependent membrane targeting of the enzyme. PKCα R249A and PKCα T251A mutant did not translocate to the plasma membrane even after ionomycin addition (Fig. 6 C). Because both these proteins interact with one of the carbonyl group of the fatty acyl chains of the phospholipid (15Verdaguer N. Corbalan-Garcia S. Ochoa W.F. Fita I. Gómez- Fernández J.C.

https://openalex.org/W1980515679,"To investigate the role of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and its downstream signaling in insulin-induced thermogenic differentiation of brown adipocytes, we have reconstituted IRS-1-deficient fetal brown adipocytes (IRS-1−/−) with wild-type IRS-1 (IRS-1wt). The lack of IRS-1 resulted in the inability of insulin to induce IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity and Akt phosphorylation in IRS-1−/−brown adipocytes. In addition, these cells showed an impairment in activating α-Akt, β-Akt, and γ-Akt isoforms upon insulin stimulation. Reconstitution of IRS-1−/− brown adipocytes with IRS-1wt restored the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway. Treatment of wild-type brown adipocytes with insulin for 24 h up-regulated uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) expression and transactivated the UCP-1 promoter; this effect was abolished in the absence of IRS-1 or in the presence of an Akt inhibitor and further recovered after IRS-1wt reconstitution. Neither UCP-2 nor UCP-3 was up-regulated by insulin in wild-type and IRS-1-deficient brown adipocytes. Insulin stimulated the expression of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and its DNA binding activity in wild-type brown adipocytes but not in IRS-1−/− cells. However, insulin stimulation of both C/EBPα expression and binding activity was restored after IRS-1wt reconstitution of deficient cells. Retrovirus-mediated expression of C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ in IRS-1−/− brown adipocytes up-regulated UCP-1 protein content and transactivated UCP-1 promoter regardless of insulin stimulation. Both C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ reconstituted FAS mRNA expression, but only C/EBPα restored insulin sensitivity in the absence of IRS-1. Finally, reconstitution of IRS-1−/− brown adipocytes with the IRS-1 mutants IRS-1Phe-895, which lacks IRS-1/growth factor receptor binding protein 2 binding but not IRS-1/p85-PI 3-kinase binding, or with IRS-1Tyr-608/Tyr-628/Tyr-658, which only binds p85-PI 3-kinase, induced UCP-1 expression and transactivated the UCP-1 promoter. These data provide strong evidence for an essential role of IRS-1 through the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway inducing UCP-1 gene expression by insulin. To investigate the role of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and its downstream signaling in insulin-induced thermogenic differentiation of brown adipocytes, we have reconstituted IRS-1-deficient fetal brown adipocytes (IRS-1−/−) with wild-type IRS-1 (IRS-1wt). The lack of IRS-1 resulted in the inability of insulin to induce IRS-1-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity and Akt phosphorylation in IRS-1−/−brown adipocytes. In addition, these cells showed an impairment in activating α-Akt, β-Akt, and γ-Akt isoforms upon insulin stimulation. Reconstitution of IRS-1−/− brown adipocytes with IRS-1wt restored the IRS-1/PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway.

The unique thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue results from the expression of the uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1)1 in the mitochondrial inner membrane required to address the physiological hypothermia in newborn mammals (1Nichols D.G. Locke R.M. Physiol. Rev. 1984; 64: 1-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). UCP-1 uncouples fatty acid oxidation from ATP synthesis, which allows dissipation of energy from substrate oxidation as heat (2Trayhurn P. Milne R.E. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1989; 67: 811-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, brown adipose tissue is a major site for lipid metabolism, fatty acids being the main fuel to maintain the thermogenic capacity of the tissue (for review, see Ref. 3Ricquier D. Bouillaud F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 161-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). It is well known that in rodents brown adipocytes differentiate at the end of the fetal life on the basis of two programs, an adipogenic program related to lipid synthesis and the expression of lipogenic enzymes, resulting in a multilocular fat droplets phenotype (4Lorenzo M. Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Benito M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Biochem.

Nutr. 1992; 12: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Regarding thermogenic differentiation, the main pathway involved in the regulation of UCP-1 gene expression is noradrenergic (8Dalgaard L.T. Pedersen O. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 946-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Klaus S. Choy L. Champigny O. Cassard-Doulcier A.-M. Ross S. Spiegelman B. Ricquier D. J.

However, because the noradrenergic stimulus, induced by hypothermia after birth, it is not yet fully developed in brown adipose tissue during late fetal development (5Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Klaus S. Choy L. Champigny O. Cassard-Doulcier A.-M. Ross S. Spiegelman B. Ricquier D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 313-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), other potential candidates involved in the onset of differentiation-related gene expression have been implicated. Recently, regulatory elements for triiodothyronine and retinoic acid have been identified in the UCP-1 promoter, suggesting alternative pathways for brown fat thermogenesis (12Alvarez R. de Andrés J.

In addition, during the last years our laboratory has found that fetal brown adipocytes display high affinity binding sites for insulin (6Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This hormone seems to be the main signal involved in fetal brown adipogenesis through its ability to induce the genetic expression of metabolic genes (6Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Navarro P. Benito M. Lorenzo M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1229-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and may as well have a role in thermogenesis by inducing UCP-1 expression (15Teruel T. Valverde A.M. Navarro P. Benito M. Lorenzo M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A complex network of intracellular signaling pathways mediates the pleiotropic effects of insulin on metabolic processes as well as on gene expression. Insulin initiates its biological effects by binding to and activating its endogenous tyrosine kinase receptors (16Kasuga M. Karlsson F.A. Kahn C.R. Science. 1982; 215: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 17Ullrich A. Bell J.R. Chen E.Y. Herrera R. Petrucelli L.M. Dull T.J. Gray A. Coussens L. Liao Y.C. Tsubokawa M. Mason A.

These receptors are believed to transduce signals by phosphorylation on tyrosine residues of several cellular substrates including IRS proteins (IRS-1, -2, -3, and -4) (18Lavan B.E. Fantin W.R.

These phosphorylated substrates then bind proteins containing Src homology 2 domains including the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) (22Backer J.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Schoelson S.E. Chin D.J. Sun X.J. Miralpeix M. Hu P. Margolis B. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. White M.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 11479-11481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which lead to activation of various downstream signaling pathways. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that fetal brown adipocytes express high levels of both IRS-1 and IRS-2, with the PI 3-kinase cascade being the main pathway involved in adipogenic- and thermogenic-related gene expression (25Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Navarro P. Benito M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 595-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we have generated immortalized fetal brown adipocyte cell lines from IRS-1 knockout fetuses (26Valverde A.M. Kahn C.R. Benito M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These cells are new tools in dissecting the signaling pathways emerging from IRS proteins responsible of the biological effects of insulin in brown adipose tissue during late fetal development. In these cells, IRS-1, but not IRS-2, is an essential requirement for insulin-induced lipid synthesis (26Valverde A.M. Kahn C.R. Benito M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear the exact role of IRS proteins and the cytosolic signaling pathways emerging downstream of IRSs that mediate insulin-induced UCP-1 expression as well as the connection with nuclear factors responsible of the transcription of the UCP-1 gene. In the present paper we have found a failure of insulin to induce UCP-1 expression in IRS-1-deficient fetal brown adipocytes. This occurs as a result of a lack of IRS-1-associated/Akt signaling and the loss of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) expression and C/EBPα DNA binding activity in response to insulin. Reconstitution with wild-type IRS-1 (IRS-1wt) and either with the Y895F mutant (IRS-1Phe-895), which lacks Grb-2 binding but not p85 binding, or with the IRS-1 mutant, which contains the substitution of Phe for Tyr in 18 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites except tyrosines at positions 608, 628, and 658 (IRS-1Tyr-608/Tyr-628/Tyr-658), results in a recovery of insulin-mediated IRS-1/PI 3-kinase/Akt activation, transactivation of the UCP1-promoter, and UCP-1 expression. In addition, overexpression of C/EBPα or PPARγ transcription factors in IRS-1-deficient brown adipocytes up-regulates transactivation of the UCP1 promoter and UCP-1 expression bypassing insulin signaling. These results demonstrate the essential role played by IRS-1 through the PI 3-kinase/Akt-signaling pathway inducing UCP-1 gene expression by insulin.

Brown adipocytes were obtained from interscapular brown adipose tissue of 17.5–18.5 fetuses from 2–3 pregnant mice of normal genotype or from a pool of tissue of fetuses obtained from 2–3 pregnant mice IRS-1+/− mated with males IRS-1−/− and further submitted to collagenase dispersion as previously described (4Lorenzo M. Valverde A.M. Teruel T. Benito M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1567-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Viral Bosc-23 packaging cells were transfected at 70% confluence by calcium phosphate coprecipitation with 3 μg/6-cm dish of the puromycin resistance retroviral vector pBabe encoding SV 40 Large T antigen (kindly provided by J. de Caprio, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Then brown adipocytes were infected at 60% confluence with Polybrene (4 μg/ml)-supplemented virus for 48 h and maintained in culture medium for 72 h before selection with puromycin (1 μg/ml) for 1 week. Several cell lines IRS-1+/+, IRS-1+/−, and IRS-1−/−were cloned and expanded, and the expression of IRS-1 was assessed by Western blot. Three clones of wild type and IRS-1−/−respectively, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and puromycin (1 μg/ml). The pBabe/hygro C/EBPα and pBabe/Zeo PPARγ viral expression vectors were generous gifts from Dr. B. Spiegelman (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Brown adipocyte IRS-1-deficient cells (clone 4) were infected with those vectors as described above. Selection with 200 μg/ml hygromycin or 250 μg/ml Zeocin was started 48 h after infection to select stable cell lines. IRS-1-deficient brown adipocytes (clone 4) were cultured for 24 h in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, and then, when 60–70% confluence was reached, cells were transfected according to the calcium phosphate-mediated protocol with the plasmid constructs indicated in each case. For pCMVhisIRS-1wt, pCMVhisIRS-1Phe-895 (derived from IRS-1 by introducing a Phe for Tyr substitution at position 895 (27Myers Jr., M.G. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Schlessinger J.

After 4–6 h of incubation, cells were shocked with 3 ml of 15% glycerol for 2 min, washed, and then fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. 24 h after transfection, histidinol (10 mm) was added to select stable transfectants. Quiescent cells (20 h serum-starved) were treated without or with several doses of insulin as indicated and lysed at 4 °C in 1 ml of a solution containing 10 mmTris/HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.6 (lysis buffer). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 10 min. After protein content determination, equal amounts of protein (500–600 μg) were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C with the corresponding antibodies. The immune complexes were collected on protein A-agarose or anti-mouse IgG-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer and extracted for 5 min at 95 °C in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm Tris/HCl, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, pH 6.8) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes and blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk or 3% bovine serum albumin in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, pH 7.5, and incubated overnight with several antibodies as indicated in 0.05% Tween 20, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the ECL Western-blotting protocol (Amersham Biosciences). PI 3-kinase activity was measured in the anti-IRS-1 or anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates by in vitrophosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol as previously described (25Valverde A.M. Lorenzo M. Navarro P. Benito M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 595-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Akt activity, cells were lysed in Buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-α-Akt, anti-β-Akt, or anti-γ-Akt polyclonal antibodies as described above. The immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with buffer A containing 0.5m NaCl, 2 times with Buffer B containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.03% Brij-35, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and once with Buffer ADB containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm sodium β-glycerol phosphate, pH 7, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The kinase reaction was started by adding to each sample 10 μl of Buffer ADB, protein kinase A inhibitor to a final concentration of 17 μm, 10 μl of 30 μm Akt/synthetic peptide of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (SGK) substrate peptide (Upstate Biotechnology, catalog No. 12–340), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol). After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by blotting 25 μl of the supernatant fraction on a P81 paper square (Whatman). Filters were washed 3 times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once with acetone, and the radioactivity remaining on the filters was measured. At the end of the culture time, cells were scraped off in isotonic isolation buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, 250 mmsucrose, pH 7.6), collected by centrifugation at 2500 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in hypotonic isolation buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, 50 mm sucrose, pH 7.6). Then cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min and homogenized under a Teflon pestle (Overhead Stirrer; Wheaton Instruments, Milville, NJ). Hypertonic isolation buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, 450 mmsucrose, pH 7.6) was added to balance the buffer tonicity. Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the pellets, containing the mitochondrial fraction, were resuspended in isotonic isolation buffer, and mitochondrial protein content was determined. Protein determination was performed by the Bradford dye method (29Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad reagent and bovine serum albumin as the standard. At the end of the culture time, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and RNA was isolated as described (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA (10 μg) was submitted to Northern blot analysis, i.e.electrophoresed on 0.9% agarose gels containing 0.66 mformaldehyde, transferred to GeneScreen membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and cross-linked to the membranes by ultraviolet light. Hybridization was performed in 0.25 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2, 0.25 mNaCl, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 7% SDS, and 50% deionized formamide containing denatured 32P-labeled cDNA (106 cpm/ml) for 24 h at 42 °C. cDNA labeling was carried out with [α-32P]dCTP by using a multiprimer DNA-labeling system. Blots were hybridized with probes for fatty acid synthase (FAS) (31Amy C.M. Witkowski A. Naggert J. Williams B. Randhawa Z. Smith S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3114-3118Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and with 18 S ribosomal probe to normalize. Membranes were subjected to autoradiography, and the relative densities of the hybridization signals were determined by densitometric scanning of the autoradiograms. Cells were resuspended at 4 °C in 10 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0,2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.75 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.75 μg/ml aprotinin (Buffer A), allowed to swell on ice for 10 min, and then vortexed for 10 s. Samples were centrifuged, and the pellet was resuspended in cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.75 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.75 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 20 min for high salt extraction. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was stored at −70 °C. The gel mobility shift assay was performed essentially as previously described (32Diaz-Guerra M.J.M. Castrillo A. Martin-Sanz P. Boscá L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6184-6190PubMed Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotide used as C/EBPα probe, corresponding to the nuclear factor-interleukin-6 (NF-IL6) site of the COX2 promoter (5′-GGGTATTATGCAATTGGAAG-3′), was synthesized in a Pharmacia oligonucleotide synthesizer. Labeling was performed by using Klenow polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP. The binding reaction mixture contained 0.5 ng of doubled-stranded oligonucleotide probe, 2 μg of poly(dI)·poly(dC), and 10 μg of protein in Buffer C supplemented with 35 mm MgCl2. In some lanes a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was used to compete away specific complexes. After 20 min of incubation at 4 °C, the mixture was electrophoresed through a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA running buffer for 2 h. Gels were then dried and subjected to autoradiography as well as quantified directly with a radioimaging device. Supershift assays were carried out after incubation of the nuclear extracts with 0.5 μg of either C/EBPα or nonspecific (non-immune rabbit serum) antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells growing in the presence of 10% fetal serum were transiently transfected according to the calcium phosphate-mediated protocol as described above. The plasmid constructs used were 4551 UCP-1-CAT (where the CAT reporter gene is under the control of a 4551-bp full-length 5′-flanking region of the UCP-1 promoter) (33Cassard-Doulcier A.-M. Gelly C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1486-1493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and pCMV β-galactosidase (gal) (a viral promoter driving expression of the reporter gene β-gal). Ten micrograms of DNA-CAT together with 2 μg of DNA-β-gal (to monitor transfection efficiency) were added to each 10-cm dish. After 4 h of incubation, cells were fed with serum-free medium for 15 h and stimulated with various doses of insulin for a further 24 h. Then cells were harvested, and lysates were prepared for CAT and β-gal activity assays. CAT activity was determined by incubating 70 μl of cell extracts with 0.25 μCi of [14C]chloramphenicol and 0.5 mm acetyl coenzyme A in 0.25 mm Tris, pH 7.8, at 37 °C for 15 h, and then samples were submitted to TLC. The amount of substrate acetylated was directly quantified with a radioimaging device (Fujifilm BAS-1000, Japan). CAT enzyme activity was expressed in arbitrary units normalized to the internal control β-gal (assayed according to the Stratagene protocol). Confluent cells (IRS-1+/+ and IRS-1−/−) were cultured for 20 h in serum-free medium and further stimulated with insulin (100 nm) for 24 h. Then cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Basal oxygen consumption rates were measured in a HANSA-TECH oxygen electrode in the presence of 30 μm palmitate as described (35Locke R.M. Rial E. Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Values were normalized by cell number. The uncoupler carbonyl cyanidep-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone at 10 μmtotally collapsed the proton gradient and allowed the determination of the fully uncoupled respiration rate. We have previously shown that immortalized fetal brown adipocytes derived from fetuses of IRS-1-deficient mice completely lack response to 10 nm insulin in activating IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity, and we also showed a 30% reduction in total PI 3-kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine (pY) immunoprecipitates (26Valverde A.M. Kahn C.R. Benito M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2122-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this response could be recovered by reintroducing wild-type IRS-1 (IRS-1wt), we reconstituted IRS-1 expression in IRS-1-deficient brown adipocytes. These cells were transfected with the pCMVhisIRS-1wt cDNA construct, and stable cell lines were selected in 10 mmhistidinol-containing medium. Fig.1 A shows that IRS-1wt expression in the reconstituted cell lines represents about 60% that seen in wild-type cells. IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity was recovered in reconstituted brown adipocytes in parallel to the level of IRS-1wt protein expressed (Fig.1 B). Likewise, insulin-induced antiphosphotyrosine-associated PI 3-kinase activity, which was reduced by 30% in IRS-1−/−cells, was totally recovered after IRS-1wt reconstitution. Because the serine/threonine kinase Akt is one of the major downstream targets of PI 3-kinase, we explored the phosphorylation of α-Akt and β-Akt isoforms as well as total Akt phosphorylation by direct Western blot analysis in wild-type , IRS-1−/− , and IRS-1wt-reconstituted brown adipocytes. In fetal brown adipocytes, the lack of IRS-1 resulted in a loss of AktSer-473 phosphorylation; only a remnant AktSer-473 phosphorylation was detected at 100 nm insulin concentration (Fig.2 A). Both α-Akt and β-Akt isoforms were phosphorylated upon insulin (10–100 nm) stimulation of wild-type brown adipocytes, as shown by the electrophoretic mobility shifts in the presence of the hormone, these effect being precluded in IRS-1−/− cells. The reintroduction of IRS-1wt in IRS-1−/− brown adipocytes resulted in a recovery of AktSer-473phosphorylation as well as α-Akt, β-Akt phosphorylation as shown by immunodetection with the anti-phospho specific AktSer-473antibody, or by the mobility shifts observed in insulin-stimulated cells with the anti-α-Akt, β-Akt, and total Akt antibodies. To confirm the results obtained from the phospho-Akt analysis, Akt kinase assays were performed in insulin-stimulated IRS-1+/+, IRS-1−/−, and IRS-1wt-reconstituted fetal brown adipocytes after immunoprecipitation with the specific antibodies for each Akt isoform. As shown in Fig. 2 B, α-Akt kinase activity was enhanced by 2- or 3-fold at 10 nm or 100 nm insulin concentrations, respectively, in wild-type brown adipocytes. Activation of α-Akt by insulin was totally blunted in IRS-1−/− cells, whereas reconstituted IRS-1wtcells recovered the level of ins"
https://openalex.org/W2091114236,"Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho family small GTPases invariably contain a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that immediately follows their Dbl homology (DH) domain. Although the DH domain is responsible for GEF activity, the role of the PH domain is less clear. We previously reported that PH domains from several Dbl family members bind phosphoinositides with very low affinity (K d values in the 10 μm range). This suggests that, unlike several other PH domains, those from Dbl proteins will not function as independent membrane-targeting modules. To determine the functional relevance of low affinity phosphoinositide binding, we mutated the corresponding PH domain from Tiam-1 to abolish its weak, specific binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. We first confirmedin vitro that phosphoinositide binding by the isolated DH/PH domain was impaired by the mutations but that intrinsic GEF activity was unaffected. We then introduced the PH domain mutations into full-length Tiam-1 and found that its ability to activate Rac1 or serum response factor in vivo was abolished. Immunofluorescence studies showed that membrane targeting of Tiam-1 was essentially unaffected by mutations in the C-terminal PH domain. Our studies therefore indicate that low affinity phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate binding by the C-terminal PH domain may be critical forin vivo regulation and activity of Tiam-1 but that the PH domain exerts its regulatory effects without altering membrane targeting. We suggest instead that ligand binding to the PH domain induces conformational and/or orientational changes at the membrane surface that are required for maximum exchange activity of its adjacent DH domain.

Its 1591-amino acid protein product, Tiam-1, is myristoylated at the N terminus (2Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J.

Tiam-1 is a member of the Dbl family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rho-like small GTPases (7Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar) and is a specific activator of Rac1in vivo (8Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Google Scholar, 9Hordijk P.L. ten Klooster J.P. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Google Scholar). By activating Rac1, Tiam-1 can influence a plethora of cellular processes including actin cytoskeleton dynamics, cell proliferation, gene transcription, cell survival, and the phagocytic NADPH oxidase complex, as reviewed by Bishop and Hall (10Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Google Scholar).The 200-amino acid DH domain is both necessary and sufficient for the GEF activity of Dbl family proteins (7Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar, 11Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Google Scholar, 12Whitehead I.P. Campbell S.

Harris E.A. Staunton D.E. Fesik S.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 269-277Google Scholar). However, in all 46 or more Dbl family GEFs, a ≈120-amino acid PH domain immediately follows the DH domain (7Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar). Dbl family GEFs account for some 18% of all known human PH domains. Deletion of the PH domain that follows the DH domain has been shown to either inhibit or stimulate the in vivofunction of several Dbl family GEFs (7Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar, 12Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: 1-23Google Scholar, 14Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Google Scholar). Together with their invariable linkage, this has been taken to suggest a regulatory coupling of DH and PH domains, although the molecular basis for this remains unclear. In general, PH domains have been implicated in directing the subcellular localization of proteins that contain them (6Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Google Scholar), by binding to phosphoinositides and/or membrane-associated protein targets. Several reports have suggested that DH-associated PH domains function in targeting Dbl family members to membrane and/or cytoskeletal compartments in vivo (15Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C.

Studies of Tiam-1, however, indicate that the primary determinants of subcellular localization lie elsewhere in the molecule (2Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A.

Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar).Several experimental observations indicate that PH domains of Dbl family proteins have specific roles in addition to (or instead of) the commonly assumed membrane targeting function. For example, the in vitro GEF activity of DH/PH fragments is far greater that that of isolated DH domains (11Hart M.J. Eva A. Zangrilli D. Aaronson S.A. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 62-65Google Scholar, 13Liu X. Wang H. Eberstadt M. Schnuchel A. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Schkeryantz J.M. Janowick D.A. Harlan J.E. Harris E.A. Staunton D.E. Fesik S.W.

Crystallographic studies of the Dbs (Dbl's big sister) DH/PH fragment (23Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Google Scholar) showed that the PH domain makes direct contacts with Cdc42 that are important for exchange activity, providing one explanation for this observation. However, no contacts between the PH domain and the small GTPase were seen in the structure of the Tiam-1 DH/PH complex with Rac1 (24Worthylake D.K. Rossman K.L. Sondek J. Nature. 2000; 408: 682-688Google Scholar), suggesting that the PH domain may play a different role in this case. One proposal, stimulated by in vivo studies of Sos (son-of-sevenless) (25Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Google Scholar) and Vav (26Ma A.D. Metjian B.S. Taylor S. Abrams C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4744-4751Google Scholar, 27Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xi Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Google Scholar), is that the PH domain exerts an inhibitory effect upon its adjacent DH domain. A crystal structure of the Sos DH/PH fragment (28Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 95: 259-268Google Scholar) suggested that this might be achieved by the PH domain sterically blocking access of the small GTPase to the relevant DH domain surface. Binding of the PH domain to phosphoinositides, such as PI 3-kinase products, has been suggested to reverse this inhibition (25Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Google Scholar, 26Ma A.D. Metjian B.S. Taylor S. Abrams C.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4744-4751Google Scholar, 27Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xi Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Google Scholar).We previously showed that the DH/PH fragments of intersectin, Dbs, and Tiam-1 bind phosphoinositides with only low affinity (K d values in the 10 μm range) (29Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Google Scholar). The intersectin and Dbs DH/PH fragments were relatively promiscuous in their phosphoinositide binding, although PtdIns(4,5)P2(because it is most abundant) is likely to be the most relevant ligandin vivo. The Tiam-1 DH/PH fragment, by contrast, showed clear selectivity (but still only low affinity) for PtdIns-3-P (29Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Google Scholar), a phosphoinositide that is enriched in endosomal compartments (30Gillooly D.J. Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Google Scholar) and is generated in phagosomal membranes (31Vieira O.V. Botelho R.J. Rameh L. Brachmann S.M. Matsuo T. Davidson H.W. Schreiber A. Backer J.M. Cantley L.C.

The phosphoinositides that bind these DH/PH fragments did not influence their GEF activity when studied using in vitro assays with nonprenylated small GTPases (29Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L.

There is significant difference of opinion in the literature as to whether phosphoinositides affect in vitro GEF activity directly, with some studies reporting effects (positive or negative) (20Russo C.

Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Google Scholar) and others reporting no effect (29Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Google Scholar). Where an effect has been observed it is not always clear whether it can necessarily be ascribed to the PH domain that follows the DH domain. To investigate whether low affinity phosphoinositide binding by DH-associated PH domains of Dbl family members is important in vivo, we have mutated the C-terminal Tiam-1 PH domain (C-PH) to abolish its PtdIns-3-P binding. We first established that PtdIns-3-P binding by the DH/PH fragment (but not GEF activity) was lost in vitro and then introduced the same mutations into full-length Tiam-1. The ability of C-PH mutated Tiam-1 to activate Rac1 when overexpressed was essentially abolished, although membrane association of the mutated protein was unaffected. We therefore propose that PtdIns-3-P binding by this PH domain is critical for in vivoregulation and activity of Tiam-1 but that the PH domain exerts its regulatory effect through a mechanism other than membrane targeting. One possibility is that the PH domain induces conformational and/or orientational changes at the membrane surface that are required for maximum exchange activity of the adjacent DH domain.DISCUSSIONIn the relatively few cases where their function is clear, PH domains are known to target their host proteins to cellular membranes by binding phosphoinositides, sometimes in cooperation with other binding targets (6Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Google Scholar, 46Maffucci T. Falasca M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 173-179Google Scholar). However, the function of most PH domains is not well understood, and the majority binds phosphoinositides with low affinity and with little if any specificity (6Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Google Scholar). The PH domains that invariably follow DH domains exhibit low affinity and usually promiscuous phosphoinositide binding in all cases studied (27Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xi Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Google Scholar, 29Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Google Scholar, 47Zheng J. Chen R.-H. Corbalan-Garcia S. Cahill S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Cowburn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30340-30344Google Scholar). Thus, DH-associated PH domains do not share the characteristics (i.e. specificity and high affinity) of PH domains that can drive membrane targeting directly, such as the phospholipase C-δ1, Grp1, and protein kinase B PH domains.In earlier studies (29Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Google Scholar) we found that the C-terminal PH domain of Tiam-1 binds with low affinity but with high apparent specificity to PtdIns-3-P in vitro. In this paper we show that mutations that abolish this low affinity PtdIns-3-P binding also greatly impair the ability of Tiam-1 to activate Rac in vivo. Because the C-PH mutations that abolish PtdIns-3-P binding do not influence the intrinsic exchange activity of the DH domain in vitro (Fig.5), this interaction must be required for stimulating (or localizing) Tiam-1 exchange activity in vivo. Our subcellular localization studies showed no influence of C-PH mutations on membrane association of Tiam-1, arguing against a role for this PH domain in phosphoinositide-dependent membrane targeting. Others have also reported that C-PH deletion does not impair membrane targeting of Tiam-1 (2Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Google Scholar, 35Fleming I.N. Gray A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 173-182Google Scholar) but can abolish its activity (34Crompton A.M. Foley L.H. Wood A. Roscoe W. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Symons M. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25751-25759Google Scholar). These results suggest that ligand binding to C-PH may activate the adjacent DH domain by promoting a conformation (or orientation) at the membrane surface that directly enhances Rac GEF activity of Tiam-1 in vivo.Several reports have shown that plasma membrane targeting of Tiam-1 is driven primarily by its N-terminal PH domain (Fig. 1), together with an adjacent 300-amino acid “protein interaction region” (2Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Google Scholar, 22Stam J.C. Sander E.E. Michiels F. van Leeuwen F.N.

The requirement for this region in Tiam-1 activity is nicely illustrated by the observation that its removal, by caspase-mediated cleavage at residue 993, inactivates Tiam-1 (37Qi H. Juo P. Masuda-Robens J. Caloca M.J. Zhou H. Stone N. Kazanietz M.G. Chou M.M. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 603-611Google Scholar). Under normal circumstances, Tiam-1 translocation to the plasma membrane is promoted by serum (2Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Google Scholar). In NIH 3T3 cells, membrane translocation can be induced by PDGF or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (45Buchanan F.G. Elliot C.M. Gibbs M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9742-9748Google Scholar). Membrane translocation is required (but is not sufficient) for Tiam-1 to activate Rac and downstream signals. Despite the fact that both PDGF and LPA induce Tiam-1 translocation to membrane fractions, only PDGF stimulates Tiam-1 exchange activity in vivo (45Buchanan F.G. Elliot C.M. Gibbs M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9742-9748Google Scholar). This difference could indicate that PDGF and LPA target Tiam-1 to distinct membrane fractions. An equally plausible hypothesis is that PDGF engages additional signaling pathway(s) not induced by LPA that are also needed for Tiam-1 activation. It is tempting to speculate that one such pathway might involve phosphoinositides, which could exert their effects by binding to the C-terminal PH domain of Tiam-1.There is no clear consensus on the role of PI 3-kinase in Tiam-1 activation. Tiam-1 translocation to the plasma membrane, mediated by its N-terminal region, does not appear to require PI 3-kinase activity (35Fleming I.N. Gray A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 173-182Google Scholar, 45Buchanan F.G. Elliot C.M. Gibbs M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9742-9748Google Scholar). The ability of Tiam-1 to activate Rac-dependent processes has been reported to be stimulated by PI 3-kinase products (35Fleming I.N. Gray A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 173-182Google Scholar, 48Sander E.E. van Delft S. ten Klooster J.P. Reid T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1385-1398Google Scholar), although other studies disagree (5Lambert J.M. Lambert Q.T. Reuther G.W. Malliri A. Siderovski D.P. Sondek J. Collard J.G. Der C.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 621-625Google Scholar, 45Buchanan F.G. Elliot C.M. Gibbs M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9742-9748Google Scholar). If PI 3-kinase were able to regulate Tiam-1 through its C-terminal PH domain without affecting Tiam-1 localization, this would resemble the situation reported for P-Rex1, a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-regulated Rac-GEF (36Welch H.C.E. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Google Scholar). P-Rex1 is regulated by PI 3-kinase in vivo and in vitro. However, this activation does not involve its translocation to the plasma membrane. Instead, a fraction of P-Rex1 that is membrane-targeted through other means is activated while present at that location by binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (36Welch H.C.E. Coadwell W.J. Ellson C.D. Ferguson G.J. Andrews S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 809-821Google Scholar), probably through its PH domain.The fact that PtdIns-3-P is the preferred ligand for Tiam-1 C-PH merits discussion. This phosphoinositide is primarily considered as a marker for endosomal compartments in the cell (30Gillooly D.J. Simonsen A. Stenmark H. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 249-258Google Scholar). Interestingly, Michielset al. (2Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Google Scholar) have observed localization of myristoylated Tiam-1 to intracellular vesicle-like structures. PtdIns-3-P is not generally considered to be a signaling phosphoinositide in the normal sense, because its levels remain quite constant with different stimuli (49Stephens L.R. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1179: 27-75Google Scholar). However, recent studies have implicated PtdIns-3-P in certain acute responses. There is clear evidence for acute de novosynthesis of PtdIns-3-P on phagosomal membranes during particle ingestion (31Vieira O.V. Botelho R.J. Rameh L. Brachmann S.M. Matsuo T. Davidson H.W. Schreiber A. Backer J.M. Cantley L.C. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 155: 19-25Google Scholar, 32Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Morgan G. Chilvers E.R. Lipp P. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1631-1635Google Scholar) and for PtdIns-3-P accumulation at plasma membrane ruffles induced by invading Salmonella (33Pattni K. Jepson M. Stenmark H. Banting G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1636-1642Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that PtdIns-3-P generation (or redistribution) could play a role in C-PH-mediated activation of Tiam-1. Indeed, a similar proposal has been made for the cytokine-independent survival kinase, which has an N-terminal (PtdIns-3-P-specific) phox homology domain that must bind PtdIns-3-P for cytokine-independent survival kinase activity (50Virbasius J.V. Song X. Pomerleau D.P. Zhan Y. Zhou G.W. Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12908-12913Google Scholar). One output for which the presence of PtdIns-3-P and activated Rac must coincide is in the assembly and activation of the neutrophil NADPH oxidase complex. PtdIns-3-P promotes assembly of this complex through the phox homology domain of p40phox (51Ellson C.D. Gobert-Gosse S. Anderson K.E. Davidson K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Thuring J.W. Cooper M.A. Lim Z.Y. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Coadwell J. Chilvers E.R. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 679-682Google Scholar), and activated Rac is known to be required for oxidase activity (52Ridley A.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 710-712Google Scholar). However, Tiam-1 has not been directly implicated in this process to our knowledge.An important implication of our findings is that binding of phosphoinositides (or other ligands) to the C-PH domain of Tiam-1 must occur once the protein is already membrane-targeted. The effective local concentration of phosphoinositides in the vicinity of membrane-targeted Tiam-1 will be very high. Therefore, an interaction that is weak (K d > 10 μm) when the two components are free in solution (such as between Tiam-1 DH/PH fragment and PtdIns-3-P in vitro) would be rather strong in the context of membrane-targeted Tiam-1. A local concentration effect of this sort presents complications for interpreting lipid binding specificity from in vitro studies. Whereas we found that C-PH of Tiam-1 is PtdIns-3-P-specific in vitro (29Snyder J.T. Rossman K.L. Baumeister M.A. Pruitt W.M. Siderovski D.P. Der C.J. Lemmon M.A. Sondek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45868-45875Google Scholar), Fleminget al. (35Fleming I.N. Gray A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 173-182Google Scholar) have reported that it also binds phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (although we are unable to detect this). Depending on the relative K d levels for these lipids and the relationship of these values to effective local concentrations in vivo, it is possible that Tiam-1 C-PH binds physiologically to all three 3-phosphoinositides. If true, this could provide a partial explanation for the variably observed PI 3-kinase dependence of Tiam-1 activity.Recent studies by Eva and co-workers (20Russo C. Gao Y. Mancini P. Vanni C. Porotto M. Falasca M. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19524-19531Google Scholar, 53Vanni C. Mancini P. Gao Y. Ottaviano C. Guo F. Salani B. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19745-19753Google Scholar) have provided a slightly different picture for the role of the DH domain-associated PH domain in Dbl. Loss of phosphoinositide binding by the Dbl PH domain actually enhanced in vivo GEF activity of a Dbl DH/PH fragment (20Russo C. Gao Y. Mancini P. Vanni C. Porotto M. Falasca M. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19524-19531Google Scholar) and FL proto-Dbl (53Vanni C. Mancini P. Gao Y. Ottaviano C. Guo F. Salani B. Torrisi M.R. Zheng Y. Eva A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19745-19753Google Scholar). However, this enhancement was only seen for Cdc42 exchange. Interestingly, the same PH domain mutations instead inhibited RhoA activation by Dbl. If only RhoA activation is considered, these studies therefore mirror our findings with Tiam-1. Der and co-workers have also reported similar results for Vav (54Palmby T.R. Abe K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39350-39359Google Scholar). The PH domain of Vav was found to be critical for its transforming activity but appeared to contribute little (if at all) to membrane association of the protein.PH domains that immediately follow DH domains in Dbl family GEFs do not appear to play a key role in membrane targeting of their host proteins. In this sense, they seem to represent a different class of PH domains from that constituted by the Bruton's tyrosine kinase, protein kinase B, Grp1, phospholipase C-δ1, and other PH domains that function as independent membrane-targeting modules (6Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Google Scholar). The fact that Dbl family GEFs are primarily membrane-targeted by other domains restricts the number of mechanisms that should be considered for their regulation by DH-associated PH domains. One possibility is that the PH domain directs the GEF to specific regions of the membrane that are enriched in a particular lipid (such as PtdIns-3-P). No evidence exists for such “lateral targeting,” although it may simply be beyond the resolution of approaches used to study localization. The second, more favored possibility is that binding of membrane phosphoinositide (or other ligand) to the PH domain optimizes the relationship between the DH and PH domains of the GEF and the lipid-anchored small GTPase to maximize exchange activity. This could simply involve promotion of an ideal orientation of the DH domain with respect to the GTPase. Alternatively, as suggested for Sos (28Soisson S.M. Nimnual A.S. Uy M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 95: 259-268Google Scholar), ligand binding by the PH domain may disfavor an auto-inhibitory relationship between the DH and PH domains. Another mode, suggested by crystallographic studies of the Dbs DH/PH fragment bound to Cdc42 (23Rossman K.L. Worthylake D.K. Snyder J.T. Siderovski D.P. Campbell S.L. Sondek J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1315-1326Google Scholar), involves promotion of critical contacts between the PH domain and the small GTPase at t"
https://openalex.org/W1982590520,"Two genes YER081W andYIL074C, renamed SER3 and SER33, respectively, which encode phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases inSaccharomyces cerevisiae were identified. These dehydrogenases catalyze the first reaction of serine and glycine biosynthesis from the glycolytic metabolite 3-phosphoglycerate. Unlike either single mutant, the ser3Δ ser33Δ double mutant lacks detectable phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activity and is auxotrophic for serine or glycine for growth on glucose media. However, the requirement for the SER-dependent “phosphoglycerate pathway” is conditional since the “glyoxylate” route of serine/glycine biosynthesis is glucose-repressed. Thus, in cells grown on ethanol both expression and activity of all SER-encoded proteins are low, including the remaining enzymes of the phosphoglycerate pathway, Ser1p and Ser2p. Moreover the available nitrogen source regulates the expression ofSER genes. However, for only SER33, and notSER3, expression was regulated in relation to the available nitrogen source in a coordinated fashion with SER1 andSER2. Based on these mRNA data together with data on enzyme activities, Ser33p is likely to be the main isoenzyme of the phosphoglycerate pathway during growth on glucose. Moreover, since phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activity requires NAD+ as cofactor, deletion of SER3 and SER33 markedly affected redox metabolism as shown by substrate and product analysis.

Moreover, since phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activity requires NAD+ as cofactor, deletion of SER3 and SER33 markedly affected redox metabolism as shown by substrate and product analysis. open reading frame matrix-assisted laser desorption high performance liquid chromatography Amino acid biosynthesis may proceed via different metabolic routes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For instance, glycine can potentially be formed from threonine via threonine aldolase, Gly1p (Fig. 1). This pathway, the “threonine pathway,” has been suggested to be the main glycine source on glucose media (1Monschau N. Stahmann K.-P. Sahm H. McNeil J.B. Bognar A.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 150: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but this function has not been verified. If glycine is formed, serine can subsequently be produced by interconversion of serine by tetrahydrofolate (THF) -dependent serine hydroxymethyltransferases, Shm1p and Shm2p (2Sinclair D.A. Dawes I.W. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1213-1222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3McNeil J.B. Bognar A.L. Pearlman R.E. Genetics. 1996; 142: 371-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Piper M.D. Hong S.-P. Ball G.E. Dawes I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30987-30995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Alternatively, serine and glycine can be formed from glyoxylate, via the “glyoxylate pathway.” However, since both the formation of glyoxylate and the alanine glyoxylate aminotransferase (encoded by YFL030W) needed for this biosynthetic pathway is glucose-repressed, this alternative route for the production of serine and glycine can only be employed in the absence of glucose (5Ulane R. Ogur M. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 34-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Melcher K. Entian K.-D. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Melcher K. Rose M. Kunzler M.

However, a third alternative is to start biosynthesis of serine and glycine from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate (Fig. 1). The first reaction in this pathway, the “phosphoglycerate pathway,” is catalyzed by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.95), producing 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate plus NADH from 3-phosphoglycerate and NAD+. The enzymes of the subsequent two reactions are phosphoserine transaminase (Ser1p, EC2.6.1.52) and phosphoserine phosphatase (Ser2p, EC 3.1.3.3). Deletion mutants of either SER1 or SER2 need an external source of serine during growth on glucose (5Ulane R. Ogur M. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 34-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Melcher K. Entian K.-D. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Belhumeur P. Fortin N. Clark M.W. Yeast. 1994; 10: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, genes encoding the first enzyme of the pathway, phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, have as yet not been identified in S. cerevisiae. Based on sequence similarity (47% identity) to the phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase gene in Escherichia coli we have previously suggested that yeast has two putative phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases (10Albers E. Gustafsson L. Niklasson C. Lidén G. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Those genes, YER081W and YIL074C, encode proteins that are 92% identical to each other. They are here denotedSER3 and SER33, respectively. Sequence similarity analysis of available phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases revealed two groups of proteins; S. cerevisiae and E. colienzymes representing one group and rat liver and B. subtilisenzymes representing the other (11Achouri Y. Rider M.H. van Schaftingen E. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The E. coli and yeast enzymes also have in common their preference for the co-substrate NAD+ instead of NADP+ (5Ulane R. Ogur M. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 34-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zhao G. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Zhao and Winkler (12Zhao G. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have shown that the E. coli enzyme has hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase activity (EC1.1.99.2) in addition to phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activity, whereas this was not the case for the rat liver enzyme (11Achouri Y. Rider M.H. van Schaftingen E. Robbi M. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Based on the above similarities we have recently suggested that the yeast enzyme may exert dual activities (10Albers E. Gustafsson L. Niklasson C. Lidén G. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, we showed 2-hydroxyglutarate to be formed from glutamate, probably via the tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediate 2-oxoglutarate, when glutamate served as the sole nitrogen source (10Albers E. Gustafsson L. Niklasson C. Lidén G. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase activity has as yet not been reported in yeast. Other proteins with homology to Ser3/33p may also be candidates for having hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase activity in S. cerevisiae: (i) Ypl113cp (27% identity), (ii) Ygl185cp (21–23% identity), with similarities to hydroxyacid dehydrogenases, (iii) Fdh1p (26–27% identity), a formate dehydrogenase, and (iv) Ynl274cp (25–26% identity), which is a putative hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase (13Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated physiological and expression properties of yeast strains with single and double deletions ofSER3 and SER33. Our data establish thatSER3 and SER33 encode phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases and that they appear to be the only enzymes with such activity in S. cerevisiae. Ser33p seems to be the main isoenzyme of the phosphoglycerate pathway of serine/glycine biosynthesis. We have used theS. cerevisiae strain, CEN.PK113–7D (MAT a SUC2 GAL MAL2–8c) as the protoptrophic wild type (14Entian K.-D. Kötter P. Brown A.J.P. Tuite M. Methods in Microbiology. 26. Academic Press, London, UK1998: 431-449Google Scholar). Mutant strains ofYER081W and YIL074C genes, YVL87 and YVL88, were obtained from the isogenic strains CEN.PK111–32D (MAT a leu2–3,112 SUC2 GAL MAL2–8c) and CEN.PK110–10C (MATα his3Δ1 SUC2 GAL MAL2–8c), respectively. All the CEN.PK strains mentioned can be received from EUROSCARF, Frankfurt, Germany (www.uni-frankfurt.de/fb15/mikro/EUROSCARF/). YPD, containing 10 g/liter of yeast extract, 20 g/liter of peptone, 20 g/liter of glucose, was used as complex medium. Agar (20 g/liter) plates were prepared from either YPD or, when defined conditions was needed, from YNB (1.7 g/liter of yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, Difco), with appropriate additions of carbon and nitrogen sources as well as supplements. Sporulation medium contained 10 g/liter of potassium acetate and 20 g/liter of agar. For liquid cultures, a synthetic defined medium was used, CBS (15Albers E. Larsson C. Lidén G. Niklasson C. Gustafsson L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with glucose as carbon and energy source at a concentration of 20 g/liter and glutamate (3.5 g/liter) or ammonium sulfate (5 g/liter) as the nitrogen source. When needed, glycine (0.5 g/liter) or serine (0.7 g/liter) was added. The initial pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.0. Inoculum cultures were grown on synthetic defined medium with glucose and were supplemented with serine. Cultures were grown in Erlenmeyer flasks (E-flasks) at 30 °C (the volume of flask was twice the volume of medium) on a rotary shaker resulting in semi-aerobic conditions and inoculated with 1.7% of the total culture volume. Each open reading frame (ORF)1 was substituted with a deletion cassette containing either the HIS3 gene (to replace ORF YIL074C) or the LEU2 gene (to replace ORF YER081C). Deletion cassettes were prepared with 2 rounds of PCR according to Wach (16Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) from the plasmids YDp-H andYDp-L, respectively (17Berben G. Dumont J. Gilliquet V. Bolle P.-A. Hilger F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 475-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), using the following oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′, the sequence complementary toYDp plasmids is underlined). For ORF YER081W: L1, ACTCACAATCGAGTAATGCC; L2,GCTCAATCAATCACCGGATCCCCGGAATGCTTGTCATTGCTGTCG; L3,GCTCAATCAATCACCGGATCCGTCGCCTCTGCTAAGATCTCAATT; L4, AATTCCATCGGTTCAGTGGA. For ORF YIL074C: L1, AGGCTTGCAGGAGCAATTGT; L2,GCTCAATCAATCACCGGATCCCCGGTCGGCAGCTGAATAAGACAT; L3,GCTCAATCAATCACCGGATCCGTCGGCCAAAGTTTCCATCAGGTT; L4, CAGTTCATTCGAGATCTCAG. PCR reactions were performed as follows: (i) first round with Taq DNA polymerase (Fermentas), 2 min at 94 °C and 30 cycles of [30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, 1 min at 72 °C], and (ii) second round with the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 min at 94 °C and 30 cycles of [15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 45 °C, 1.5 min at 68 °C]. A final elongation step of 10 min was performed at the end of both rounds. Deletion cassettes were then purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) and introduced in yeast cells according to Ito et al. (18Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For gene disruption, cells were routinely grown at 30 °C on YPD plates. Deletion mutants were selected on YNB-HIS or YNB-LEU plates (6.7 g/liter of a yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate but without amino acids, with addition of 0.77 g/liter CSM-HIS or 0.69 g/liter CSM-LEU (BIO101), respectively). Correct integration of the replacement cassettes was confirmed by PCR on genomic DNA (19$$Google Scholar) using primers L1 and L4, and restriction analysis of the amplified fragment. Six individual clones were tested for each disruption. Double mutants were obtained by mating and subsequent tetrad analysis of the strains YVL87 (MAT a yer081w::LEU2) and YVL88 (MATα yil074c::HIS3). Genomic DNA from 20 segregants (5 tetrads) was prepared, and the presence of both replacement cassettes was verified by PCR and enzymatic restriction. No defects in mutant mating or in sporulation efficiency were observed. Biomass concentration was determined from dry weight and optical density measurements at 610 nm (OD610). Growth curves were performed by measurements of the OD610 in E-flask cultures or in microtiter plates in 350-μl cultures (BioScreen, Labsystems) by measurement of the turbidity during 36 h (OD measurements over 20 min). The turbidity was recalculated to true OD using a calibration curve earlier determined (20Warringer J. Blomberg A. Yeast. 2003; 20: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) to compensate for the non-linear OD measurements at higher cell densities. From these curves the maximal specific growth rate was determined. Growth tests were performed on YNB plates, with a carbon source (20 g/liter of glucose or ethanol), a main nitrogen source (5 g/liter of ammonium, 3.5 g/liter of glutamate, or 10 g/liter glycine or threonine), and eventually an additional nitrogen source (120 mg/liter serine, glycine, or threonine). Inocula were grown in liquid YPD. Cells were washed in the corresponding YNB medium and diluted to an OD610 of 1. Aliquots of 10 μl of serial one-tenth dilutions (undiluted and 5 subsequent dilutions) were dropped on plates with appropriate medium and incubated for 2 days (ethanol plates for 6 days) at 30 °C. Product formation and substrate consumption of the entire respiro-fermentative growth phase were determined from medium samples taken at inoculation and directly after glucose exhaustion. Glucose depletion was checked using Diabur-Test® 5000 test-strips (Roche). Extracellular concentrations of metabolites (including glucose) were measured with HPLC (Waters) using an ion-exchange column, HPX-87H, BioRad, as described previously (10Albers E. Gustafsson L. Niklasson C. Lidén G. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Glutamic acid concentration was determined using an enzymatic kit assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Glycine was determined by measurements of the total free amino acid nitrogen concentration, by staining with ninhydrin (21European Brewery Convention Analytica-EBC. 4th Ed. European Brewery Convention, Zurich1987: E141-E142Google Scholar), from which the glutamic acid contribution was subtracted. The standard solution contained both glutamate and glycine in the same concentration ranges as present in the experiments. Gene expression was investigated in cells grown in CBS medium supplemented with glucose as carbon source, and glutamate (± serine, threonine, or glycine) or ammonium as nitrogen source. Cells were grown at 30 °C, and RNA was extracted from cells during respiro-fermentative exponential growth to the diauxic shift. Total RNA was isolated from yeast cells as described by Ausubel et al. (19$$Google Scholar) using a FastPrep apparatus (BIO101). RNA samples (10 μg per lane) were fractionated on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde, transferred by downward capillary blotting onto Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences) in 10× SSC (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.1-7.87Google Scholar) and cross-linked using a GS GeneLinker (BioRad). Blots were then prehybridized at 65 °C for at least 2 h in 5× SSC, 50 mm NaH2PO4 (from a 1 mstock solution at pH 6.5), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and then hybridized at 65 °C for 16 h with a 32P-labeled probe. The mRNA encoding the inorganic pyrophosphatase, IPP1, was selected as reference. SER1, SER2, YNL274C,YPL113C, YGL185C, FDH1, andIPP1 probes were prepared from the following PCR fragments (5′ to 3′).

These were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/ml) by use of a Megaprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) and purified on a Nick column (Amersham Biosciences). SER3 andSER33 probes were prepared from the following oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′, 24 nucleotides). SER3; TAAGTTGTTAATGTCAATGCTTGT and ACAGCATTCAAGCGCTGTGGAACG.SER33; TAAATTATCGGCAGCTGAATAAGA and GTAATGCTTACACGACGAGGTAGT. These were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/ml) by use of the T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI) and purified on a microspin G25 column (Amersham Biosciences). The specificities of the oligonucleotides used for probing SER3 and SER33 mRNA were controlled using the ser3Δ, ser33Δ, andser3Δ ser33Δ strains. Blots were washed 2× 5 min at room temperature and 2× 5 min at 65 °C in 0.5× SSC/0.1% SDS, then exposed 6–24 h to PhosphorImager screens. Non-saturated signals were measured by a BioRad FX PhosphoImager and quantified by densitometry. Values were normalized by comparison with IPP1 signals. For labeling of proteins, duplicate cultures were inoculated from overnight cultures giving a starting OD610 of 0.07 and grown to an OD610 of 0.35–0.39 in glucose/glutamate medium supplemented with glycine. A volume of 1 ml was transferred to a separate flask (10 ml) and 8 μl (3.2 MBq) of l-[35S]methionine (specific activity >37 TBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was added. The cultures were grown for another 30 min and then placed on ice. Cells were harvested (15,000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min), washed once with ice-cold milliQ water (Millipore), and the resulting cell pellet was stored at −80 °C until used. Proteins were extracted, the amount of incorporated 35S was measured and proteins (in 2,000,000 dpm of extract) were separated by two-dimensional PAGE (23Norbeck J. Blomberg A. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The protein pattern was detected by phosphorimaging and protein quantification was performed by image analysis with the PDQUEST software (BioRad). At least 2-fold and statistically significant changes (Student's t test on log-transformed data) in protein levels were distinguished. Resolved proteins have previously been identified by microsequencing or MALDI-MS (23Norbeck J. Blomberg A. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 24Larsson T. Norbeck J. Karlsson H. Karlsson K.-A. Blomberg A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 418-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Protein identity data can be found at yeast-2DPAGE.gmm.gu.se. Crude cell extracts were prepared from 50 ml of culture. Cells were harvested (2,000 × g, 4 °C, 5 min) and washed twice (20 and 1 ml) with washing buffer (10 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm EDTA). The sedimented cell pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C until further treatments. The thawed cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of extraction buffer (2 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol in 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5) and supplemented with protease inhibitors (1 μl of 35 g/liter phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride in ethanol and 0.6 μl of 0.8 g/liter pepstatin and 1.2 g/liter leupeptin in ethanol). Cells were disrupted by vortexing with 1 g of glass beads (diameter 0.5 mm) for 5 min at 4 °C. The suspension was then transferred to a 1.5-ml tube, and the beads were washed with 0.5 ml of extraction buffer (supplemented with appropriate amounts of protease inhibitors). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g, 4 °C, 15 min (if necessary twice), pooled supernatants were used immediately for measurement of enzyme activity and protein content. For preparation of crude extracts used in analysis of phosphoserine phosphatase (Ser2p) activity (see below), Tris-HCl buffer at the same concentration and pH was used instead of the ordinary phosphate buffer. Enzyme activities (except for Ser2p activity) and protein content were measured at 30 °C on a COBAS Fara Autoanalyser (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein concentration was determined according to Lowryet al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as standard. Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.95) activity was measured by reduction of hydroxypyruvate phosphate, following the decrease of NADH at 340 nm. The reaction mixture contained 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.25 mm NADH, 400 mm KCl, and 0.36 mm hydroxypyruvate phosphate (prepared from the corresponding dimethylketal, Sigma) in 40 mmKH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.5. For measurements of phosphoserine transaminase activity the assay of Hirsch-Kolb and Greenberg was essentially used (26Hirsch-Kolb H. Greenberg D.M. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 17B: 331-334Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar), following the decrease of NADH. The reaction mixture contained 4 mm NaF, 0.25 mm NADH, 30 mm ammonium acetate, 20 μm pyridoxal phosphate, 10 units/ml of glutamate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)-dependent, type III bovine liver, Sigma), 8 mm Na-l-glutamate, and 0.36 mm hydroxypyruvate phosphate in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2. Phosphoserine phosphatase was determined manually at 30 °C with crude extracts in a reagent solution containing 5 mm O-phospho-l-serine and 5 mmMgCl2 in 65 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. The reaction was stopped in aliquots of reaction mixture (320 μl) with 80 μl of trichloroacetic acid (250 g/liter) at appropriate time intervals after extract addition (up to 10 min). Subsequent determination of released phosphate was performed according to Dryeret al. (27Dryer R.L. Tammes A.R. Routh J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 225: 177-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There was no background release of phosphate in the reagent solution during the time of measurement, thus giving the enzymatic activity directly from the rate of phosphate release. Hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.2) activity was measured by reduction of 2-oxoglutarate, following the decrease of NADH. The reaction mixture contained 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mm NADH, and 5 mm 2-oxoglutarate in 40 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.5. Formation of 2-hydroxyglutarate during assay condition was checked by HPLC. Glutamate dehydrogenase activity was shown to negligibly contribute to the reduction of NADH in the hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase assay, despite the fact that the crude extracts contained small amounts of ammonium. Activity of hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase was measured in the same way as the hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase, except that 6 mmof 2-oxoisocaproate was used as substrate. Enzyme activity (units, μmol/min) was determined from the difference in slope of NADH absorbance (at 340 nm, ε = 6.3 mm−1 cm−1) after and before addition of substrate (3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate plus glutamate, 2-oxoglutarate, or 2-oxoisocaproate). When the slope prior to substrate addition was equal to or larger than the slope after substrate addition, then the detection limit was estimated as follows. The variances of the two slopes obtained in the linear regression of absorbance data were added and the 95% confidence interval was calculated according to at-distribution. The detection limit was around 0.2 units/g of protein for the phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and between 0.1–0.6 units/g of protein for the hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenase. The full-length coding sequences of SER3 (YER081W) and SER33 (YIL074C) were deleted and replaced with LEU2 and HIS3 markers, respectively, in the haploid strains CEN.PK111–32D and CEN.PK110–10C, respectively. This yielded isogenic strains without auxotrophic markers. A haploid double deletion mutant was obtained by mating and subsequent sporulation. The single and double deletion mutants were viable and formed colonies of normal size and morphology on complex media. During growth on glucose, deletion mutants of all functional phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases should result in a block in the phosphoglycerate pathway of serine/glycine biosynthesis. Such mutants would require externally available serine or glycine, provided that no alternative pathways are active, such as the glyoxylate or threonine pathways (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig.2 A, the SER3 andSER33 genes encode the only functional phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases since the double mutant required serine for growth, while the single ser3Δ and ser33Δ mutants could grow in the absence of serine. Furthermore, the glyoxylate pathway provides no alternative during growth on glucose since it is glucose-repressed (5Ulane R. Ogur M. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 34-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Melcher K. Entian K.-D. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 7Melcher K. Rose M. Kunzler M. Braus G.H. Entian K.-D. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8Takada Y. Noguchi T. Biochem. J. 1985; 231: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast, as expected the ser3Δ ser33Δ mutant grew well on ethanol as the only carbon source with ammonium as the only nitrogen source (Fig. 2 B). In addition, the double deletion mutant (ser3Δ ser33Δ) provides an opportunity to investigate the function of the second alternative pathway, the threonine pathway, which has been suggested to be important during growth on glucose (1Monschau N. Stahmann K.-P. Sahm H. McNeil J.B. Bognar A.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 150: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, addition of threonine did not allow growth of the double mutant, either when added to ammonium (data not shown) or glutamate (Fig. 2 C) as the main nitrogen sources or when used as the sole nitrogen source (data not shown). Thus, the threonine pathway seems to be non-functional during all conditions tested. Surprisingly, the addition of glycine to ammonium-containing medium did not support growth of the double mutant (Fig. 2 A). However, ammonium mediates strong nitrogen catabolite repression on for example uptake systems (28ter Schure E.G. van Riel N.A.W. Verrips C.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 67-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We therefore tested other nitrogen sources (Fig.2 C). The double mutant could grow on both glycine (or serine; data not shown)-supplemented glutamate medium or on glycine as the sole nitrogen source (data not shown). Both single deletion mutants could grow also on glutamate as sole nitrogen source (Fig.2 C). We have measured enzymatic activities in crude extracts to confirm the function of Ser3p and Ser33p as phosphoglycerate dehydrogenases (Table I). The activity of the phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase in Escherichia coli is inhibited by serine and to a lesser extent by glycine (12Zhao G. Winkler M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 29Sugimoto E. Pizer L.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2081-2089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Grant G.A. Schuller D.J. Banaszak L.J. Prot. Sci. 1996; 5: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Since inhibition by serine has been reported also for yeast (5Ulane R. Ogur M. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 109: 34-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), glycine was used as a supplementing nitrogen source to glutamate in the following experiments in order to minimize inhibition of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase while still allowing growth on glucose of the ser3Δ ser33Δ double mutant. The ser3Δ ser33Δ mutant showed no phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activity (Table I), indicating that only these two genes encode such an activity. The specific activity determined in the wild-type strain was equivalent to the sum of the activities found in the single mutants. The reduction of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activity was more pronounced in the ser33Δ mutant, indicating that Ser33p is the major isoenzyme. As may be expected, since externally accessible glycine reduces the need for its biosynthesis, addition of glycine reduced the activity in all strains tested, most prominently in theser33Δ mutant. Externally available glycine may affect the expression of the SER3 and SER33 genes or modulate the activity of Ser3p and Ser33p directly. To clarify the situation, the mRNA expression was studied during growth with different nitrogen sources, see below. Also when glycine was added to the medium, the activities measured in the single mutants added up to that of the wild-type strain.Table IPhosphoglycerate dehydrogenase activityType of strainPhosphoglycerate dehydrogenase act"

The clotting of recalcified platelet-free plasma (PFP) or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) supplemented with corn trypsin inhibitor (to shut down contact activation) was studied in well-plates or flow assays. Inhibitors of cathepsin G or elastase significantly delayed the burst time (t 50) of thrombin generation in neutrophil-supplemented PRP from 49 min to 59 and 77 min, respectively, in well-plate assays as well as reduced neutrophil-promoted fibrin deposition on fibrinogen-adherent platelets under flow conditions. In flow assays, purified cathepsin G was a far more potent activator of platelet-dependent coagulation than elastase. Anti-tissue factor had no effect on neutrophil protease-enhanced thrombin formation in PRP. The addition of cathepsin G (425 nm) or convulxin (10 nm) to PRP dramatically reduced the t 50 of thrombin generation from 53 min to 17 or 23 min, respectively. In contrast, the addition of elastase to PRP left the t 50unaltered. Whereas perfusion of PFP (γw = 62.5 s−1) over fibrinogen-adherent platelets did not result in fibrin formation until 50 min, massive fibrin could be observed on cathepsin G-treated platelets even at 35 min. Cathepsin G addition to corn trypsin inhibitor-treated PFP produced little thrombin unless anionic phospholipid was present. However, further activation inhibition studies indicated that cathepsin G enhances fibrin deposition under flow conditions by elevating the activation state of fibrinogen-adherent platelets rather than by cleaving coagulation factors.

The triggered display of platelet procoagulant activity is the major requirement for effective blood coagulation.

Both Cat G and human neutrophil elastase are serine proteinases of the chymotrypsin family. Cat G can cleave the plasma zymogens factor V and factor X as well as activate spread human platelets via protease-activated receptor 4 with consequent calcium mobilization (1Allen D.H. Tracy P.B. J.

GPVI, which is associated with the Fc receptor γ chain (14Chen H. Locke D. Liu Y. Liu C. Kahn M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3011-3019Google Scholar), mediates the signaling response to collagen (15Goel M.S. Diamond S.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 3797-3803Google Scholar, 16Quinton T.M. Ozdener F. Dangelmaier C.

Once activated, platelets participate in the assembly of the tenase (IXa/VIIIa) and prothrombinase (Xa/Va) complexes by providing anionic phospholipid binding sites for prothrombin, factor X, factor V, and factor XI to help accelerate coagulation (18Heemskerk J.W. Bevers E.M. Lindhout T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 186-193Google Scholar, 19Krishnaswamy S. Field K.A. Edgington T.S. Morrissey J.H. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26110-26120Google Scholar). Neutrophil-platelet interactions during adhesion and heterotypic aggregation have been associated with the enhancement of thrombosis. Using a Dacron graft thrombosis model, Palabrica et al. (20Palabrica T. Lobb R. Furie B.C. Aronovitz M. Benjamin C. Hsu Y.M. Sajer S.A. Furie B. Nature. 1992; 359: 848-851Google Scholar) observe that diminished neutrophil accumulation in the presence of anti-P-selectin was also accompanied by reduced fibrin deposition. Circulating levels of neutrophil-platelet complexes have been found to increase in hip arthroplasty patients (21Bunescu A. Widman J. Lenkei R. Menyes P. Levin K. Egberg N. Clin. Sci. (Lond.). 2002; 102: 279-286Google Scholar), a group prone to deep vein thrombosis. In a different study, recombinant P-selectin glycoprotein ligand immunoglobulin reduced experimentally induced venous thrombosis (22McEver R.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 364-365Google Scholar). However, the relative roles of human neutrophil elastase and Cat G and the prioritization of various mechanisms through which these proteases promote coagulation under flow conditions has not been well studied. Although neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G can activate platelets and/or participate in coagulation cascade reactions directly, their activity may be limited by the presence of antiproteases present in plasma (23de Gaetano G. Cerletti C. Evangelista V. Haemostasis. 1999; 29: 41-49Google Scholar). Our previous studies (24Goel M.S. Diamond S.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 2093-2098Google Scholar) have focused on the effects of neutrophil-platelet interactions on subsequent fibrin formations under venous flow conditions. We demonstrated that individual neutrophils alone can accelerate fibrin deposition if factor XIIa is present due to contact activation by a CD18-dependent mechanism attenuated with inhibitors of elastase or cathepsin G. In the presence of corn trypsin inhibitor (CTI) to block factor XIIa, neutrophils promote fibrin formation on fibrinogen-adherent platelets through pathways attenuated by inhibitors of human neutrophil elastase and Cat G. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which neutrophil proteases alter platelet function. Cathepsin G, more so than elastase, plays the major role in turning fibrinogen-adherent platelets procoagulant. Cathepsin G does so by elevating the activation state of fibrinogen-adherent platelets rather than by cleavage of plasma zymogens factor X and factor V in plasma. Relative rates of thrombin generation for various coagulation scenarios have been measured under static conditions to complement the videomicroscopy-imaged flow assays aimed at understanding the role of neutrophils in thrombosis under venous hemodynamic conditions. Human neutrophil elastase, human cathepsin G, human thrombin, and calf skin collagen (Calbiochem), human serum albumin (Golden West Biologicals, Temecula, CA),N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP), bovine brainl-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine, and bovine brainl-α-phosphatidylcholine (Sigma), CTI, human fibrinogen, factor X, and anti-human tissue factor monoclonal antibody TFE (Enzyme Research Labs, South Bend, IN), and convulxin (Centerchem, Norwalk, CT) were stored following the manufacturers' recommendations. MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-CMK (human neutrophil elastase inhibitor) and Z-Gly-Leu-Phe-CMK (cathepsin G inhibitor) were from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). The fluorogenic substrate for thrombin, tboc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA (boc-VPR-MCA), was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories (San Carlos, CA). Human blood was collected from healthy adult donors by venipuncture and anticoagulated with sodium citrate (9 parts blood to 1 part sodium citrate). Neutrophils were isolated by centrifugation over neutrophil isolation medium (Robbins Scientific) as previously described (24Goel M.S. Diamond S.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 2093-2098Google Scholar, 25Schmidtke D.W. Diamond S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 719-730Google Scholar). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained by centrifugation of anticoagulated whole blood at 130 ×g for 15 min. Platelet singlets were prepared by gel filtration (24Goel M.S. Diamond S.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 2093-2098Google Scholar). After isolation, neutrophils or platelets were diluted to final concentrations of 106 or 108 cells/ml, respectively. Rectangular glass capillaries (Vitrocom, Mountain Lakes, NJ) with a cross-section of 0.2 × 2.0 mm, a length of 7 cm, and a wall thickness of 0.15 mm were used as flow chambers as previously described (24Goel M.S. Diamond S.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 2093-2098Google Scholar, 25Schmidtke D.W. Diamond S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 719-730Google Scholar). To enable adhesion of neutrophils or platelets microcapillary flow chambers were incubated with human fibrinogen solution (100 μg/ml) for 120 min at room temperature or with calf skin collagen (100 μg/ml) for 4 h at 4 °C. The chambers were rinsed, and cells were allowed to adhere under no-flow conditions as described previously (24Goel M.S. Diamond S.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 2093-2098Google Scholar). In selected experiments, adhesion of platelets was preceded by their treatment with human neutrophil elastase (10 μg/ml) or cathepsin G (10 μg/ml). Platelet-free plasma treated with CTI (50 μg/ml) was perfused into the flow chambers containing defined surface compositions at a controlled flow rate using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus). The wall shear stress (τw) imposed on the surface was calculated from the solution of the Navier-Stokes equation for laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid; τw = (6Qμ)/(B 2 W), whereQ represents the flow rate (cm3/s), μ represents the viscosity (0.01 poise at room temperature), Brepresents the total plate separation (0.02 cm), and Wrepresents the width (0.2 cm). Consequently, the wall shear rate, γw (s−1), can be calculated as γw = 6Q/B 2 W. A flow rate of 50 μl/min corresponded to a shear stress of 0.625 dyne/cm2and a wall shear rate of 62.5 s−1. To activate fibrinogen-adherent platelets, convulxin (10 nm) was perfused over surface-adherent platelets for 10 min. During flow experiments, the microcapillary flow chambers were mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope, and a 63× (NA 1.40) oil immersion objective lens (Plan Apochromat) was used to conduct differential interference contrast microscopy. Human neutrophil elastase (11.5 μg/ml; 425 nm), cathepsin G (10 μg/ml; 425 nm), factor VIIa (2 nm), anti-tissue factor (50 μg/ml), anionic phospholipid vesicles (50 μm), and/or convulxin (10 nm) were mixed with recalcified citrated platelet-rich plasma supplemented with factor X (170 nm) and CTI (50 μg/ml) in a 96-well plate. Fluorogenic substrate for thrombin (tboc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA; 20 μm) was added to the reaction mixture (150 μl/well) for kinetic measurements of thrombin generation. In selected experiments, isolated neutrophils (106 cells/ml), fMLP (20 μm), and elastase inhibitor (100 μm, MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-CMK) or cathepsin G inhibitor (100 μm, Z-Gly-Leu-Phe-CMK) were added to the reaction mixture. To prepare vesicles,l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS) andl-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) were mixed (1:1 wt %) and dried under nitrogen. The dry film was hydrated with buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl) and sonicated for 15 min. Using dynamic light scattering (DynaPro 99), the PSPC vesicle diameter was determined to be 158 ± 52 nm. Fluorescence in the 96-well plate was measured using a Fluoroskan Ascent fluorometer (excitation 390 nm; emission 460 nm). All well plate experiments were performed at 37 °C. Recalcified citrated PFP containing CTI (contact pathway inhibitor of factor XIIa (24Goel M.S. Diamond S.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 2093-2098Google Scholar, 26Holmes M.B. Scuider D.J. Hayes M.G. Sobel B.E. Mann K.G. Circulation. 2000; 102: 2051-2057Google Scholar)) was perfused over three different surfaces, fibrinogen-adherent platelets, convulxin-treated fibrinogen-adherent platelets, and collagen-adherent platelets (Fig.1) at a wall shear rate of 62.5 s−1 for t = 35 min. Fibrin deposition on fibrinogen-adherent platelets was essentially undetectable, but substantial fibrin deposition was observed on the latter two surfaces. Although it is known that collagen-adherent platelets are more activated and more procoagulant than fibrinogen-adherent platelets (15Goel M.S. Diamond S.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 3797-3803Google Scholar,27Briede J.J. Heemskerk J.W. van't Veer C. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 509-513Google Scholar, 28Heemskerk J.W. Vuist W.M. Feijge M.A. Reutelingsperger C.P. Lindhout T. Blood. 1997; 90: 2615-2625Google Scholar), these observations demonstrate that direct convulxin activation of platelets on a fibrinogen-coated surface can stimulate fibrin formation to levels comparable with that found on collagen-adherent platelets. Because convulxin, a C-type lectin isolated from Crotalus durissus terrificus venom, is a GPVI-specific platelet activator, this is the first report of activation of platelet GPVI receptor in turning platelets procoagulant under venous flow conditions for platelets maintaining adhesion via GPIIb/IIIa binding to adsorbed fibrinogen. When fibrin formation (γw = 62.5 s−1) on a cell mixture of fibrinogen-adherent neutrophils and platelets was compared with that over surfaces coated with either neutrophils or platelets alone, extensive fibrin formation was visualized on the surface coated with both neutrophils and platelets (Fig. 2), demonstrating the role of neutrophil-platelets interactions in promoting fibrin generation. In addition, this fibrin accumulation was attenuated by specific peptide inhibitors against cathepsin G (Z-Gly-Leu-Phe-CMK; 100 μm) or, to a lesser extent, elastase (MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Ala-CMK; 100 μm), indicating the role of these neutrophil proteases in the interaction. To quantify the effect of neutrophil-platelet interactions on platelet procoagulant activity under static conditions, thrombin (factor IIa) activity in recalcified citrated PRP (supplemented with factor X and CTI) was compared in the absence or presence of neutrophils. Also, the roles of fMLP-stimulation and inhibition of elastase or cathepsin G on the dynamics of thrombin generation were examined (Fig.3). Consistent with the flow experiments, peak thrombin generation (t 50, the time to reach 50% thrombin substrate conversion) by PRP was sped up by neutrophils (13 min faster) and was significantly delayed when a specific peptide inhibitor of cathepsin G (10-min lag) or elastase (28-min lag) was added to fMLP-stimulated neutrophils in PRP. The 13-min difference int 50 from the columns labeled N andNo N (Fig. 3) was not statistically different (atn = 3). However, this is due to the large standard deviation in the mean t 50 in the absence of neutrophils, primarily induced by the t 50 value from the last trace. To clarify the situation, we repeated the experiment and observed that introduction of more data points (not shown) along with donor variation alters the difference between meant 50 in columns labeled N and No N to 11 min, which is statistically significant (p< 0.1, n = 6). Thrombin generation in PRP with neutrophils present was not further influenced by fMLP. Interestingly, inhibition of cathepsin G, although delaying the time to reach maximal thrombin activity, caused a significant 3-fold increase in the maximum thrombin production rate, presumably due to protection of GPIb from degradation (9Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Perry D.W. Rand M.L. Packham M.A. Thromb. Res. 1999; 95: 315-323Google Scholar, 10Pidard D. Renesto P. Berndt M.C. Rabhi S. Clemetson K.J. Chignard M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 489-498Google Scholar). In separate experiments, the addition of either cathepsin G inhibitor or elastase inhibitor to neutrophils, which were not treated with fMLP, in PRP delayed thrombin production by 14 min (p < 0.05) and 18 min (p < 0.025), respectively. The meant 50 in the presence of neutrophils alone, neutrophils with cathepsin G inhibitor, and neutrophils with elastase inhibitor (all in PRP, no fMLP) were 57 ± 9 (n = 6), 71 ± 9 (n = 3), and 75 ± 8 (n = 3), respectively. Preincubation of neutrophils with adherent platelets for 45 min in the absence of plasma (which contains α1-antitrypsin) before the start of the flow experiment (Fig. 2) may explain the different “clotting times” between Figs. 2 and 3. Also, the close adhesion (and surface spreading) of neutrophils and platelets in Fig. 2, which favors delivery of Cat G from neutrophils to platelets (and adhesion-potentiated signaling), is not achieved in static assay where mass transfer- and gravity-induced heterotypic aggregation in PRP is insufficient. To test which of the neutrophil proteases (elastase or cathepsin G) played the most critical role in turning platelets procoagulant, fibrin formation on fibrinogen-adherent platelets (γw= 62.5 s−1) was compared with that over platelets treated with either 10 μg/ml elastase or cathepsin G. We also tested if both proteases can act in a combined manner to amplify coagulation. Fibrin fibers started appearing on untreated fibrinogen-adherent platelets (control) only after 50 min (Fig.4 A). At 35 min of perfusion of CTI-treated PFP, untreated fibrinogen-adherent platelets showed no fibrin formation, and elastase-treated platelets showed a trace of fibrin deposition, whereas the platelets treated with either cathepsin G alone or both proteases demonstrated massive fibrin formation (Fig.4 B). These observations indicate that cathepsin G is more potent than elastase in turning platelets into coagulating structures. Moreover, a coupled activity by both proteases is not a prerequisite to achieve full activation of fibrinogen-adherent platelets. To examine if cathepsin G turns platelets procoagulant through cell activation or through zymogen cleavage of plasma factors on the platelet surface, platelets were treated with different concentrations of cathepsin G (10, 1, or 0.1 μg/ml) in separate flow chambers for a short duration of 5 min. Cathepsin G treatment of platelets was then followed immediately by 5 min of buffer perfusion with the peptide inhibitor of cathepsin G (100 μm) and subsequent perfusion of recalcified PFP/CTI supplemented with the peptide inhibitor (100 μm). Although no fibrin formation could be observed on fibrinogen-adherent platelets without cathepsin G treatment (control) at 45 min, the cathepsin G-treated platelets supported abundant fibrin deposition. Fig. 4 C shows fibrin formation on platelets treated with the lowest cathepsin G concentration (0.1 μg/ml). Identical results were seen for 1.0 and 10 μg/ml Cat G pretreatment of platelets (not shown). Formation of fibrin on platelets treated with a low concentration of cathepsin G and then rinsed with a cathepsin G inhibitor indicated that platelet activation is the dominant mechanism through which cathepsin G turns fibrinogen-adherent platelets procoagulant. To verify that cathepsin G is a more potent activator of platelet procoagulant activity, thrombin generation in recalcified citrated PRP/CTI was compared with that in the presence of cathepsin G, elastase, or both proteases. Although the addition of cathepsin G to PRP reduced the t 50 of thrombin generation from 53 to 18 min, the addition of elastase had no effect (Fig.5). Treatment of PRP with both neutrophil proteases resulted in a t 50 of 17 min, indicating that this promptness in thrombin production was mainly due to cathepsin G activity on platelets with no cooperativity with human neutrophil elastase. In a separate set of experiments, the possible role of tissue factor in protease-mediated activation of coagulation (6Higuchi D.A. Wun T.C. Likert K.M. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 1712-1719Google Scholar, 7Zillmann A. Luther T. Muller I. Kotzsch M. Spannagl M. Kauke T. Oelschlagel U. Zahler S. Engelmann B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 603-609Google Scholar) was assessed by comparing thrombin generation in PRP treated with cathepsin G and elastase in the presence or absence of a tissue factor antibody. The presence of this antibody did not significantly alter thrombin production (Fig. 6). It is interesting to note that t 50 for thrombin production due to elastase and cathepsin G activity on platelets was comparable witht 50 for thrombin produced as a result of platelet stimulation by the potent GPVI agonist, convulxin (no proteases). As a control, progress curves were obtained to analyze thrombin generation in PFP (no platelets) in the presence of both cathepsin G and elastase. An extremely low rate of thrombin generation (Fig. 6) implied that thrombin production seen in all earlier experiments was solely platelet-dependent and that even high concentrations of neutrophil proteases do not result in significant thrombin production in plasma lacking platelets. We investigated the role of anionic phospholipid surface as a cofactor for neutrophil-enhanced thrombin generation. The production of thrombin in PFP (no platelets) was measured in the presence or absence of PSPC vesicles (Fig. 7). PSPC addition to PFP produced little thrombin, indicating that mere phosphatidylserine exposure during platelet activation is not sufficient for coagulation of the plasma. When neutrophil elastase was added to PFP containing PSPC, thrombin generation was also minimal. However, a detectable level of slow thrombin production was observed when cathepsin G or elastase/cathepsin G was added to PFP/CTI containing PSPC. This is the first report of PSPC enhancing cathepsin G-mediated thrombin production in PFP treated with CTI, potentially due to protection of lipid bound cathepsin G from inhibition. These results indicated that platelet phospholipid exposure alone is not sufficient for the cathepsin G-enhanced coagulation seen in Figs. 2, 4, 5, and 6. As a control when a progress curve for thrombin generation in PFP containing both elastase and cathepsin G was obtained, negligible thrombin production (also seen earlier in Fig. 6) was detected. We demonstrated that adherent neutrophils enhanced thrombin generation and fibrin formation on fibrinogen-adherent platelets through released proteases cathepsin G and elastase either in flow assays or well-plate assays. Among these two proteases, cathepsin G was far more potent than elastase in activating platelet-dependent coagulation of CTI-treated PRP. Cathepsin G does so by elevating the activation state of platelets rather than by cleaving coagulation factors in plasma or on the platelet anionic surface (Fig. 8). The increased thrombin production of neutrophil protease-treated PRP is not altered by anti-tissue factor, suggesting that Cat G activity does not necessarily result in detectable de-encryption of tissue factor. We show that direct Cat G activation of fibrinogen-adherent platelets can also turn platelet procoagulant to levels comparable with that of convulxin-stimulated platelets or collagen-adherent platelets. The addition of PSPC alone to CTI-treated platelet free plasma demonstrated that the presence of a negatively charged phospholipid surface is not sufficient to initiate coagulation. Cathepsin G is cationic (29Ferrer-Lopez P. Renesto P. Prevost M.C. Gounon P. Chignard M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1992; 119: 231-239Google Scholar), and the slight increase in thrombin levels on the addition of PSPC supports the view that cathepsin G-mediated cleavage of coagulation factors on a negatively charged surface may help support, albeit in a secondary role, cathepsin G-mediated platelet activation. In comparison to cathepsin G-enhanced thrombin generation in PFP containing PSPC, a five times higher thrombin production in PRP (presence of platelets) indicates that platelets have additional means, beyond merely presenting negative phospholipid, through which they respond to cathepsin G stimulation. These results are in agreement with studies by Sumner et al. (30Sumner W.T. Monroe D.M. Hoffman M. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 533-543Google Scholar), which show that PS exposure does not correlate with factor Xa or thrombin production on platelets and suggest that surface participants other than PS are involved in coagulation (31Monroe D.M. Hoffman M. Roberts H.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1381-1389Google Scholar). Fibrin accumulation under the conditions of Fig.4 C supports the view that cathepsin G is predominantly activating platelets rather than cleaving zymogens on the platelet surface. Neutrophil-enhanced platelet-dependent coagulation (under factor XIIa inhibition by CTI) could not be attenuated by an antibody against tissue factor. It remains possible that after an initial production of minuscule amounts of thrombin through a platelet-supported factor VIIa pathway, factor XI was being activated to XIa on activated platelets by thrombin to trigger the intrinsic pathway in the absence of the upstream contact pathway protein factor XIIa (32Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Google Scholar, 33Baglia F.A. Badellino K.O. Li C.Q. Lopez J.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1662-1668Google Scholar, 34Gailani D. Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1991; 253: 909-912Google Scholar). It also remains a possibility that surface-bound Cat G activates platelet-released factor V. Although the addition of a cathepsin G inhibitor to neutrophils in PRP attenuated thrombin generation in plasma, it unexpectedly increased the maximum rate of thrombin generation by 3.7 times (as seen in the difference in slopes on the progress curves in Fig. 3). This may be attributed to the degradation of platelet GPIb by cathepsin G. The surface expression of GPIb, which has been found to be the counter-receptor for neutrophil Mac-1 (35Simon D.I. Chen Z. Xu H. Li C.Q. Dong J. McIntire L.V. Ballantyne C.M. Zhang L. Furman M.I. Berndt M.C. Lopez J.A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 193-204Google Scholar), is expected to increase after the interaction of platelets with neutrophils. However, it is known that neutrophil cathepsin G can degrade GPIb (9Kinlough-Rathbone R.L. Perry D.W. Rand M.L. Packham M.A. Thromb. Res. 1999; 95: 315-323Google Scholar, 10Pidard D. Renesto P. Berndt M.C. Rabhi S. Clemetson K.J. Chignard M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 489-498Google Scholar). In the light of these studies, whereas the addition of cathepsin G inhibitor to PRP containing neutrophils may not have prevented neutrophil-assisted platelet GPIb expression, it may have blocked the degradation of GPIb by neutrophil cathepsin G. Additionally, GPIb, when left intact, would allow factor XI binding to it where activation of factor XI by a minimal amount of thrombin can accelerate thrombin production via the intrinsic coagulation pathway (33Baglia F.A. Badellino K.O. Li C.Q. Lopez J.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1662-1668Google Scholar). As expected, this increased rate of thrombin generation is not observed in the absence of neutrophil-platelet interactions due to a possible lack of increased GPIb expression. However, an overall delay in thrombin production in the presence of cathepsin G inhibitor was most likely the result of a decline in platelet activation levels due to cathepsin G inhibition. Under flow conditions, mass transfer by dispersion and convection can alter the concentration of local factors (36Kuharsky A.L. Fogelson A.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1050-1074Google Scholar). The burst in thrombin production is vital to make fibrin under flow conditions, and this fibrin is critical for clot stabilization. The close contact of activated platelets and activated neutrophils mediated by P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 in the absence of tissue factor or collagen may allow for the function of Cat G. Transfer of Cat G to platelet anionic phospholipid may also facilitate its activating function in the presence of plasma inhibitors such as α1-antitrypsin (37Chignard M. Hazouard E. Renesto P. Laine A. Guidet B. Offenstadt G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 433-440Google Scholar,38Coakley R.J. Taggart C. O'Neill S. McElvaney N.G. Am. J. Med. Sci. 2001; 321: 33-41Google Scholar). In summary, we show that neutrophil proteases, most notably cathepsin G, can promote thrombin generation and subsequent fibrin formation on platelets under static or venous flow conditions. Cat G does so by elevating the activation state of platelets. This platelet activation and resultant procoagulant activity involves additional factors beyond anionic phospholipid exposure by activated platelets. These events may be clinically relevant in situations void of collagen or tissue factor such as those involving biomaterial thrombosis or endothelial dysfunction and neutrophil activation during deep vein thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W2094524290,"The refined structure of a wheat type 2 nonspecific lipid transfer protein (ns-LTP2) liganded withl-α-palmitoylphosphatidylglycerol has been determined by NMR. The 15N-labeled protein was produced in Pichia pastoris. Physicochemical conditions and ligandation were intensively screened to obtain the best NMR spectra quality. This ns-LTP2 is a 67-residue globular protein with a diameter of about 30 Å. The structure is composed of five helices forming a right superhelix. The protein presents an inner cavity, which has been measured at 341 Å3. All of the helices display hydrophobic side chains oriented toward the cavity. The phospholipid is found in this cavity. Its fatty acid chain is completely inserted in the protein, the l-α-palmitoylphosphatidylglycerol glycerol moiety being located on a positively charged pocket on the surface of the protein. The superhelix structure of the protein is coiled around the fatty acid chain. The overall structure shows similarities with ns-LTP1. Nevertheless, large three-dimensional structural discrepancies are observed for the H3 and H4 α-helices, the C-terminal region, and the last turn of the H2 helix. The lipid is orthogonal to the orientation observed in ns-LTP1. The volume of the hydrophobic cavity appears to be in the same range as the one of ns-LTP1, despite the fact that ns-LTP2 is shorter by 24 residues."

The EVH1 domain and the extreme C-terminal leucine zipper motif were molecular determinants for its synaptic targeting. The overexpression of the mutant of the EVH1 domain or deletion of the extreme C-terminal leucine zipper motif markedly suppressed the synaptic localization of endogenous shank but not PSD-95 or GKAP.

Additionally, overexpression of PSD-Zip45 and an isoform of shank induced synaptic enlargement in association with the further accumulation of synaptic F-actin. The EVH1 domain and extreme C-terminal leucine zipper motif of PSD-Zip45 were also critical for these events.

However, these protein-protein interactions were identified in a piecemeal fashion in vitro. The molecular organization and dynamic interactions of a postsynaptic protein lattice in vivo therefore remain largely unknown. Here we focused on the molecular mechanism underlying the synaptic targeting of PSD-Zip45 and its effect on other PSD scaffold proteins. We demonstrated that both the EVH1 domain and C-terminal leucine zipper motif of PSD-Zip45 are critical for its synaptic targeting and that PSD-Zip45/shank and PSD-95/GKAP form different compartments in the synapse. In addition, the synaptic localization of shank is PSD-Zip45-dependent, and their interaction is involved in the enhanced accumulation of synaptic F-actin, and overexpressing these molecules induces synaptic enlargement in association with the further accumulation of synaptic F-actin.DISCUSSIONRecent studies (31Craven S.E. El-Husseini A.E. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1999; 22: 497-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 37Arnold D.B. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1999; 23: 149-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) have demonstrated the synaptic targeting of some PSD scaffold proteins. The first example was the synaptic targeting of PSD-95, in which the N-terminal palmitoylation, the first two PDZ domains, and/or a C-terminal targeting motif are critical. Naisbitt et al. (11Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 569-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) reported that the overexpression of GKAP variant, which lacks the PDZ-binding sequence, caused a marked reduction in the levels of the endogenous shank family members in the synapse. Sala et al. (36Sala C. Piëch V. Wilson N.R. Passafaro M. Liu G. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 115-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) also identified the molecular determinants of the shank family required for their synaptic targeting as their PDZ domain and the flanking sequences and concluded that an interaction between the PDZ domain of shank 1B and the C terminus of GKAP was important for the synaptic localization of shank 1B. Angoet al. (38Ango F. Pin J.P. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Worley P.F. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8710-8716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) analyzed the distribution of exogenous type 5 mGluR (mGluR5) and Homer proteins using cerebellar granule cells in which mGluR5 and Homer 1 proteins were absent, and their findings suggested that the synaptic targeting of mGluR5 is Homer protein-dependent. However, they did not address the molecular determinants of the Homer proteins. We recently reported (14Okabe S. Urushido T. Konno D. Okado H. Sobue K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9561-9571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that PSD-Zip45 that is exogenously expressed in hippocampal neurons is targeted to the synapses and that its targeting is dynamically regulated by Ca2+ influxes from different sources. Here, we studied the molecular determinants required for the synaptic targeting of PSD-Zip45 and the effects of PSD-Zip45 variants on the synaptic localization of other PSD scaffold proteins and F-actin.Synaptic Targeting of PSD-Zip45 and Compartmentalization of Major PSD Scaffold ProteinsExogenous PSD-Zip45 showed a synaptic localization with other major PSD scaffold proteins, including PSD-95, GKAP, and shank (Fig. 1). We identified both the EVH1 domain and the extreme C-terminal leucine zipper motif of PSD-Zip45 as the molecular determinants for its synaptic targeting (Fig. 2). Furthermore, overexpression of PSD-Zip45G89A or PSD-Zip45ΔZipB markedly suppressed the synaptic localization of endogenous shank, but not of PSD-95 or GKAP, in a dominant-negative fashion (Fig. 3). These results suggest that the synaptic localization of PSD-Zip45 is a prerequisite for that of shank, and both of PSD-Zip45G89A and PSD-Zip45ΔZipB cannot recruit shank to the synapses because neither of them is targeted to the synapses. It has been reported that GKAP interacts with the shank family via its PDZ domain and that overexpressed GKAP-L694A, which does not bind shank, suppresses the synaptic localization of shank (11Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 569-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). In contrast, we demonstrated here that whereas GKAP-WT and GKAP-L694A were targeted precisely to the synapses, overexpressed GKAP-WT and GKAP-L694A did not affect the synaptic localization of endogenous shank (Fig. 4). Thus, there is a discrepant result regarding the interaction between GKAP and shank within the synapses. The molecular length of GKAP, clone2–2A, used by us is longer than that by Naisbitt et al. (11Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 569-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). We also constructed GKAP-L694A, a mutant of clone2-2A, that lacked the shank binding activity. Naisbitt et al. (11Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 569-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) used a C-terminal deleted variant of GKAP lacking the shank binding activity. Furthermore, we introduced the plasmids into cultured neurons by the microinjection method, whereas Naisbitt et al. (11Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 569-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar) used the transfection method with calcium phosphate. However, it remains unknown whether these different constructs and expression methods might produce the above discrepant result. Our present results indicate that the synaptic localization of shank depends on that of PSD-Zip45 but not of GKAP. It might be inferred from these data that PSD-Zip45-shank and PSD-95-GKAP interactions form different compartments in the synapses. The currently accepted model for a postsynaptic protein lattice is that the shank family members provide molecular bridges between NMDA receptor-PSD-95-GKAP, mGluR-PSD-Zip45, and α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor-GRIP complexes, the actin cytoskeleton, and the Ca2+-sequestering machinery (25Sheng M. Kim E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Xiao B. Tu J.C. Worley P.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 39Ehlers M.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R848-R850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Almost all of these interactions, however, have been demonstrated by in vitro assays. We reported previously (14Okabe S. Urushido T. Konno D. Okado H. Sobue K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9561-9571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that although PSD-95 clusters in the synapses of living hippocampal neurons are less dynamic, PSD-Zip45 shows a highly dynamic and rapid redistribution that is regulated by Ca2+ influxes from different Ca2+ sources. Combining our results, we suggest that PSD-95-GKAP and PSD-Zip45-shank complexes form different compartments in the synapse with respect to their interactions and dynamics.Linkages between PSD-Zip45, Shank, and the Actin Cytoskeleton in the SynapseBecause the shank family interacts in vitro with cortactin through a cortactin-binding motif in the proline-rich region of the shank proteins (11Naisbitt S. Kim E. Tu J.C. Xiao B. Sala C. Valtschanoff J. Weinberg R.J. Worley P.F. Sheng M. Neuron. 1999; 23: 569-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar, 24Du Y. Weed S.A. Xiong W.C. Marshall T.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5838-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), it has been postulated that the actin cytoskeleton is involved in the synaptic localization of PSD-Zip45 and shank. In support of this idea, our recent studies (14Okabe S. Urushido T. Konno D. Okado H. Sobue K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9561-9571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that the synaptic localization of PSD-Zip45 is linked to the polymerization/depolymerization dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. In this paper, we further compared the linkages between four PSD scaffold proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. Treating hippocampal neurons with the actin-depolymerizing reagent latrunculin A caused a decrease in the synaptic localization of F-actin, PSD-Zip45, and shank but not of PSD-95 or GKAP (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the synaptic organization of the actin cytoskeleton is closely associated with PSD-Zip45 and shank.The PSD-Zip45-shank complex may link to the actin cytoskeleton through the cortactin-shank interaction or another actin-binding protein that interacts with the PSD-Zip45-shank complex. The former possibility, however, seems to be unlikely because the synaptic localization of shank was quite different from that of cortactin (data not shown). Alternatively, there are several pieces of evidence that support the latter possibility. The N terminus of Cupidin/Homer2a has been reported to interact with F-actin in vitro (40Shiraishi Y. Mizutani A. Bito H. Fujisawa K. Narumiya S. Mikoshiba K. Furuichi T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8389-8400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We did not, however, detect a direct interaction between PSD-Zip45 and F-actin (data not shown). In contrast, we demonstrated that overexpression of PSD-Zip45WT enhances the synaptic accumulation of F-actin without enhancing that of shank (Fig. 6 A,a1–a3). Sala et al.(36Sala C. Piëch V. Wilson N.R. Passafaro M. Liu G. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 115-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) reported that overexpression of both shank 1B and Homer 1b induces synaptic enlargement in association with an increase in synaptic F-actin. Consistent with this, we found that both of overexpressed PSD-Zip45 and CortBP1 were highly concentrated in the enlarged synapses with F-actin (Fig. 6 A,d1–d3). This enhanced accumulation of synaptic F-actin was also observed in the normal-sized synapses in neurons overexpressing PSD-Zip45WT alone (Fig.6 A,a1 and a3). In contrast, overexpressed PSD-Zip45G89A and PSD-Zip45ΔZipB did not affect the synaptic localization of F-actin whether or not CortBP1 was also overexpressed (Fig. 6). These results indicate that the synaptic localization of PSD-Zip45 is a prerequisite for that of shank, and the complex formation between PSD-Zip45 and shank is critically linked to the enhanced accumulation of synaptic F-actin. Why did overexpressed PSD-Zip45 alone enhance synaptic accumulation of F-actin without the accumulation of shank? This may be due to the difference of endogenous shank and actin pools, in which free shank is more limited than F-actin. Actually, both of the overexpressed PSD-Zip45 and CortBP1 were highly concentrated in the synapses with the enhanced accumulation of F-actin. Our present results further indicate that increasing the levels of synaptically targeted PSD-Zip45 and shank through overexpression induces synaptic enlargement in association with the enhanced accumulation of synaptic F-actin. Future study will be required to elucidate the involvement of the PSD-Zip45-shank and actin interaction in the postsynaptic structure and function. As revealed by electron microscopy, the postsynaptic density (PSD)1 is a dense structure of the excitatory synapses in the central nervous system (1Palay S.L. Exp.

We isolated PSD-Zip45, a novel member of the Homer family, using a PSD-specific monoclonal antibody. This protein contains an enabled/VASP homology 1 (EVH1) domain at its N- and C-terminal leucine zipper motifs (6Sun J. Tadokoro S. Imanaka T. Murakami S.D. Nakamura M. Kashiwada K. Ko J. Nishida W.

In a complementary manner, dominant negative RhoA caused a precocious organization of the tight junction, adherens junction, and the F-actin rings in the absence of steroid, whereas the monolayer TER remained glucocorticoid-responsive.

Tight junction assembly is generally thought to require the initial engagement of cell-cell contacts at the adherens junction, which lies immediately basal to the tight junction and is responsible for intercellular adhesion between neighboring cells (14Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2894) Google Scholar). Adherens junction formation is a process that is mediated by the calcium-dependent intercellular adhesion between E-cadherin molecules and the formation of an intracellular protein complex that includes E-cadherin, β-catenin, α-catenin, plakoglobin, and the actin cytoskeleton (8Furuse M.

These events trigger a series of molecular processes leading to the recruitment of tight junction components to the points of cell-cell contact and formation of a tight paracellular seal of the epithelium (13Madara J.L.

The architecture of the apical junctional complex, the cytoskeleton, and sealing of tight junctions at the sites of cell-cell contact can be regulated in a dynamic manner depending on the tissue origin, physiological state, and availability of specific sets of extracellular cues (3Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 30Nusrat A. Turner J.R. Madara J.L. Am. J.

These observations implicate the potential involvement of distinct signal transduction cascades that functionally target the tight junction and/or adherens junctions in epithelial cells. We have discovered that glucocorticoids, one class of steroid hormones, induce tight junction formation and cell polarity through a multistep cascade in cultured mammary epithelial cells (33Woo P.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5443-5453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). An early glucocorticoid-regulated step in the overall cascade is the rapid stimulation in expression of the helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulatory molecule Id-1, which is required for the steroid control of cell tight junction dynamics (38Woo P.L. Cercek A. Desprez P.Y. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28649-28658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In a later set of events, glucocorticoids induce the recruitment of the tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin), adherens junction proteins (E-cadherin and β-catenin), as well as the Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase cell signaling proteins to the cell periphery at the sites of cell-cell contact (38Woo P.L. Cercek A. Desprez P.Y. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28649-28658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This junctional reorganization process is followed by a distinct Ras- and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent step that results in formation of highly sealed tight junctions in a polarized cell monolayer (38Woo P.L. Cercek A. Desprez P.Y. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28649-28658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids down-regulate the level of fascin protein (37Wong V. Ching D. McCrea P.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5443-5453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), an actin-bundling protein that binds to the adherens junction protein β-catenin. Fascin acts as inhibitor of tight junction formation, and we have recently shown that transforming growth factor-α disrupts junctional organization by preventing the steroid down-regulation of fascin (35Guan Y. Woo P.L. Rubenstein N.M. Firestone G.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Given the complex nature of the steroid-regulated cascade leading to tight junction formation, additional classes of regulatory proteins may functionally link the cytoskeleton to the control of tight junction dynamics in mammary epithelial cells. One such potential category of cell signaling molecules is the Rho family of small GTPases which includes RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 (39Ridley A.J.

In several cell systems, RhoA has been shown to be involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and has been implicated in regulating the spatial organization of adherens and/or tight junction proteins (41Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kotani H. Nishioka H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 42Jou T.S. Nelson W.J. J.

However, an unambiguous role for RhoA in controlling cell-cell interactions has not been defined because of tissue/cell type-specific differences in RhoA-activating cellular cascades and in the experimental manipulation of tight junction formation. A unique feature of the Con8 mammary epithelial tumor cells is the ability to control acutely and reversibly the organization and function of the apical junctional complex with glucocorticoid treatment without having to first destroy and then rebuild tight junctions. In this study, we demonstrate that glucocorticoids down-regulate RhoA levels and that this regulatory process is required for the steroid-induced remodeling of the apical junction architecture that leads to functional tight junctions. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (50:50) and calf serum were supplied by BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Phosphate-buffered saline, trypsin-EDTA, and dexamethasone were obtained from Sigma. G418 was purchased from Invitrogen. Permeable tissue culture supports/filter inserts were manufactured by Nunc and distributed by Applied Scientific (San Francisco, CA). Polyclonal rabbit anti-ZO-1, monoclonal mouse anti-β-catenin antibodies, monoclonal anti-α-occludin antibodies, monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies (clone 9E10), monoclonal anti-actin antibodies, as well as anti-actin Texas Red-conjugated rhodamine phalloidin were purchased from Zymed Laboratories, Inc.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were supplied by Cappel Laboratories (Malvern, PA). Monoclonal anti-RhoA antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The plasmids expressing dominant active and dominant negative RhoA (pcEXV-Myc-RhoA.V14 and pcEXV-Myc-RhoAD.N19, respectively) and empty vector (pcEXV) were a kind gift from Dr. Marc Symons (Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Richmond, CA). Con8 rat mammary epithelial tumor cells have been described previously (37Wong V. Ching D. McCrea P.D. Firestone G.L. J. Biol.

To generate control, dominant active, and dominant negative Rho cell lines, the neomycin-resistance gene containing plasmids pcEXV-Myc-RhoA.V14, pcEXV-Myc-RhoA.DN19, and the pcEXV empty vector were transfected into Con8 cells. After selection with the neomycin analog G418 for 2 weeks, 50 clones were selected, expanded, and tested for induction of Myc-tagged RhoA. All cell lines were routinely grown to 100% confluence on Nunc permeable supports in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% calf-serum and penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere of air/CO2 (95:5). For culturing of cells transfected with either the RhoA.V14 or RhoA.N19 expression vector, G418 was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 600 μg/ml. The cell culture medium was changed every day during the experimental treatment. For the glucocorticoid treatment of cells, the synthetic glucocorticoid agonist dexamethasone (Sigma) was added to the normal growth medium at a final concentration of 1 μm (prepared as a 1,000 μm stock in ethanol). Formation of tight junction was monitored by daily measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) using an EVOM Epithelial Voltohmmeter (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL), as we have described previously (33Woo P.L.

Calculations for ohms·cm2 were determined by subtracting the resistance measurement of a blank filter and multiplying by the area of the monolayer. Con8- and RhoA-transfected rat mammary cells were grown on Nunc filters and incubated with or without 1 μm dexamethasone for several days. Cells were treated every 24 h. For fluorescent analysis, the cell layers were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (BioWhittaker) and fixed with 1.75% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. After three additional washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the plasma membrane was permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 extraction buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mmNaCl, 20 mm Hepes, and 5 mm EDTA) for 15 min at room temperature. After blocking in 5% non-fat dry milk, filters were stained for 1 h with anti-ZO-1 antibodies followed by a 1-h incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. For costaining, the cells were incubated with either β-catenin antibodies followed by Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies or with Texas Red-conjugated actin-phalloidin. Fluorescent images were obtained from a Zeiss axiograph, and confocal fluorescent images were taken with a Leica confocal microscope and processed with the corresponding Leica software on Microsoft Windows NT. For Western blot analyses, cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (BioWhittaker) and extracted in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors. Samples were normalized for protein content with the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay. Cell lysates were fractionated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically from the gel to a nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations, Inc., Westboro, MA). Blots were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk in washing buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for at least 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with anti-RhoA or anti-α-occludin antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After three washes for 10 min each in 1% non-fat dry milk in washing buffer, the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Bio-Rad) for 1 h. The blots were then washed twice with 1% non-fat dry milk in washing buffer and once with washing buffer. The blots were developed with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences chemiluminescence reagent kit. The level of RhoA protein observed in the Western blots was quantified with the Scion image program (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). Our previous studies (33Woo P.L. Ching D. Guan Y. Firestone G.L. J.

As a first step to determine whether the small GTPase RhoA plays a regulatory role in this cascade, we examined the effects of glucocorticoids on the level of RhoA protein. After reaching confluence, Con8 cells were serum starved for 24 h, treated with or without 1 μm synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone for up to 4 days, and RhoA protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti-RhoA-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig.1 A, dexamethasone caused a significant down-regulation of RhoA protein compared with the untreated control cells. This down-regulation was typically detectable by 8 h of steroid treatment and reached statistically significant levels by 48 h, which continued throughout the time course. Western blots probed with anti-actin antibodies (Fig. 1 A, upper blot) and anti-α-occludin antibodies (Fig. 1 A,lower blot) show that these protein levels remained generally constant during the time course, with some fluctuations in α-occludin protein. These protein levels did not change in response to dexamethasone treatment, thus providing a control for the specificity of the effects of glucocorticoids on RhoA protein levels. In untreated cells, RhoA protein levels at different time points can vary slightly from experiment to experiment, without a statistically significant change (p = 0.05) overall during the period of the time course (data not shown). Parallel sets of time course experiments examined the monolayer TER in confluent Con8 cells cultured on Nunc filter supports in the presence or in the absence of dexamethasone. The percent steroid-induced increase in TER was determined at each time point as the ratio of TER observed in steroid treated versus nontreated cells. Consistent with our previous studies (33Woo P.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 404-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), after an approximate 24-h time lag, dexamethasone-treated cell monolayers displayed a significant increase in monolayer resistance, and the absolute TER plateaued at about 1,000 ohms·cm2 by 4 days in steroid (Fig. 1 B). The results from several RhoA Western blots were also averaged and plotted as the percentage of RhoA protein detected in dexamethasone-treated cells compared with untreated control cells. As also shown in Fig. 1 B, the dexamethasone down-regulation of RhoA protein correlates with the stimulation of TER and becomes statistically significant (p = 0.05) at 48 h. These results suggest a potential causative relationship between the glucocorticoid regulation of RhoA protein levels and tight junction formation. To assess functionally the requirement of the glucocorticoid down-regulation of RhoA for tight junction formation and/or sealing, stable Con8-derived cell lines expressing either the constitutively active or dominant negative forms of RhoA were established. The pcEXV-Myc-RhoA.V14 expression plasmid encodes a constitutively active RhoA protein, which maintains the GTP-bound form of the protein, and an N-terminal Myc epitope tag. The pcEXV-Myc-RhoA.N19 expression plasmid also contains an N-terminal Myc epitope tag and encodes a dominant negative RhoA that binds more tightly to Rho-GEFs than the wild type GTPase, and thus preventing activation of endogenous RhoA, without binding to effector proteins (50Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). After selection of transfected Con8-derived cells with the neomycin analog G418 for 2 weeks, individual cell clones were selected, expanded, and tested for their expression of Myc-tagged RhoA mutant proteins using a monoclonal Myc antibody (Fig.2). Cells expressing the empty vector behaved identically to the wild type, untransfected Con8 cells, therefore we chose to use wild type cells as controls for the remainder of the experiments. The Con8-DN25 (expressing the dominant negative RhoA) and the Con8-V6 (expressing the constitutively active RhoA) cells were utilized for further characterization of the role of RhoA in the glucocorticoid-induced tight junction formation. To determine whether the Con8-derived cell lines expressing either the dominant negative or constitutively active RhoA remain responsive to glucocorticoids, Con8-V6 and Con8-DN25 cells, along with control Con8 cells, were grown on tissue culture dishes and treated either with or without 1 μm dexamethasone for 5 days. This relatively long time point was utilized because it represents the glucocorticoid treatment duration needed to observe the maximal stimulation in TER in the parental Con8 cells (see Fig. 1). Total cell extracts were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and Western blots were probed with antibodies specific for RhoA to detect total RhoA protein.

These β-cells demonstrated elevated fractional insulin secretion and elevated cytosolic Ca2+ levels compared with wild-type and vector controls. This effect of IRS-1 may be mediated via an interaction with the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Here we demonstrate that IRS-1 and IRS-2 localize to an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-enriched fraction in β-cells using subcellular fractionation. We also observe co-localization of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 with ER marker proteins using immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. Furthermore, immuno-electron microscopy studies confirm that IRS-1 and SERCA3b localize to vesicles derived from the ER. In Chinese hamster ovary-T (CHO-T) cells transiently transfected with SERCA3b alone or together with IRS-1, SERCA3b co-immunoprecipitates with IRS-1. This interaction is enhanced with insulin treatment. SERCA3b also co-immunoprecipitates with IRS-1 in wild-type and IRS-1-overexpressing β-cell lines. Ca2+uptake in ER-enriched fractions prepared from wild-type and IRS-1-overexpressing cell lines shows no significant difference, indicating that the previously observed decrease in Ca2+uptake by IRS-1-overexpressing cells is not the result of a defect in SERCA. Treatment of wild-type β-cells with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of SERCA, resulted in an increase in glucose-stimulated fractional insulin secretion similar to that observed in IRS-1-overexpressing cells. The colocalization of IRS proteins and SERCA in the ER of β-cells increases the likelihood that these proteins can interact with one another. Co-immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 and SERCA in CHO-T cells and β-cells confirms that these proteins do indeed interact directly. Pharmacological inhibition of SERCA in β-cells results in enhanced secretion of insulin. Taken together, our data suggest that interaction between IRS proteins and SERCA is an important regulatory step in insulin secretion.

The first step in insulin secretion is the metabolism of glucose in β-cells (1Hedeskov C.J. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 442-509Google Scholar, 2Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 223-241Google Scholar, 3Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Google Scholar). Glucose enters the β-cell through GLUT2 transporters on the plasma membrane. Glucose metabolism begins with glucokinase, the β-cell glucose sensor (4Matschinsky F. Liang Y. Kesavan P. Wang L. Froguel P. Velho G. Cohen D. Permutt M.A. Tanizawa Y. Jetton T.L. Niswender K. Magnuson M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2092-2098Google Scholar), and results in an increase in the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio. This causes closure of ATP-dependent K+ channels and β-cell plasma membrane depolarization. The depolarization event leads to Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels (5Dukes I.D. Philipson L.H. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 845-853Google Scholar, 6Henquin J.C. Jonas J.C. Gilon P. Diabetes Metab. 1998; 24: 30-36Google Scholar). Increased cytosolic Ca2+ stimulates insulin exocytosis by the β-cell through Ca2+-dependent protein kinase pathways. Insulin acts on a variety of tissues by binding to the insulin receptor (IR).1 Insulin binds to the dimerized insulin receptor and causes activation of the catalytic tyrosine kinase in the IR β-subunit. The IR tyrosine kinase then autophosphorylates intracellular tyrosine residues on the insulin receptor itself, which act as docking sites for insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS-1 and IRS-2) and Shc. These proteins are then phosphorylated by the insulin receptor and interact with several downstream effectors including phosphoinositide 3-kinase and Grb2. These effectors mediate glucose transport, cell growth, and various other important cellular functions. A growing body of evidence has confirmed that the insulin receptor-signaling pathway is active in the pancreatic β-cell and is involved in regulating key cellular processes (7Xu G.G. Gao Z.Y.

Insulin stimulation of the β-cell IR results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the catalytic IR β-subunit and IRS proteins (8Rothenberg P.L. Willison L.D. Simon J. Wolf B.A. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 802-809Google Scholar). Mice with a pancreatic β-cell-specific knockout of IR exhibit hyperinsulinemia and impaired glucose tolerance that develops after 6 months (11Kulkarni R.N. Bruning J.C. Winnay J.N. Postic C. Magnuson M.A. Kahn C.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 329-339Google Scholar). In addition, these mice lose their acute first-phase glucose-stimulated insulin secretion response. The loss of IRS-1 leads to mild insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and β-cell hyperplasia but no overt diabetic phenotype (17Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S.

Nature. 1994; 372: 182-186Google Scholar). Islets and β-cells derived from these IRS-1 knockout mice show decreased insulin content of 51 and 55%, respectively, and a lower glucose-stimulated insulin secretion response (21Kulkarni R.N. Winnay J.N. Daniels M. Bruning J.C. Flier S.N. Hanahan D. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R69-R75Google Scholar). In contrast, the loss of IRS-2 in mice causes early insulin resistance and eventually a decrease in β-cell mass, β-cell failure, and overt type II diabetes (17Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H. Burks D.J. Ren J.M. Previs S. Zhang Y. Bernal D. Pons S. Shulman G.I. Bonner-Weir S. White M.F. Nature. 1998; 391: 900-904Google Scholar, 22Withers D.J. Burks D.J. Towery H.H. Altamuro S.L. Flint C.L. White M.F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 32-40Google Scholar). Analysis of islets and β-cells from IRS-2 knockout mice revealed no secretory defects, but altered β-cell growth (23Bonner-Weir S. Withers D.J. Weir G.C. Jonas J.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: A3Google Scholar). This difference in phenotype of IRS knockouts indicates that these substrates mediate different functions in the β-cell. The mechanisms by which IRS-1 and IRS-2 accomplish these roles remain unclear. Two studies that examined the role of IRS-1 in insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic β-cells and β-cell lines found that IRS-1 also has an effect on calcium homeostasis. In one study, the overexpression of IRS-1 in the βTC6-F7 cell line (β-IRS1) lead to an increase in the glucose-stimulated fractional insulin secretion (ratio of secreted insulin/total insulin content) and, interestingly, an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (7Xu G.G. Gao Z.Y. Borge Jr., P.D. Wolf B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18067-18074Google Scholar). This increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was also seen in a cell line overexpressing the IR, but not in a cell line overexpressing a kinase-deficient mutant of IR. Further investigation revealed that the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ was the result of inhibition of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), a protein responsible for Ca2+ uptake into the ER lumen. When the control β-cell line was treated with thapsigargin, a SERCA inhibitor, the cytosolic Ca2+ levels increased to the same level as the β-IRS1 cell line. Furthermore, ER calcium uptake in a digitonin-permeabilized cell system was reduced in the β-IRS1 cells compared with controls. In another study, insulin exocytosis and intracellular Ca2+levels of single β-cells from IRS-1-deficient mouse islets and IRS-1 null β-cell lines were measured (24Aspinwall C.A. Qian W.J. Roper M.G. Kulkarni R.N. Kahn C.R. Kennedy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22331-22338Google Scholar). In the absence of IRS-1, insulin exocytosis and cytosolic calcium were decreased. Taken together, these data indicated that some mechanism mediated by the activation of IRS-1 through the insulin receptor affects the influx of Ca2+ into the ER, resulting in changes in Ca2+homeostasis and insulin secretion. One potential explanation for this effect is that IRS-1 interacts directly with SERCA and inhibits its function. For this to occur, activated IRS-1 must first be in the same vicinity as SERCA. Previous studies examining the subcellular distribution of IRS proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell lines have shown that both IRS-1 and IRS-2 distribute to the cytosol and intracellular membranes (IM) of cells, but the majority is located within the IM (25Kublaoui B.

Studies using ultracentrifugation, sucrose density gradients, and detergent precipitation, demonstrate that IRS proteins localize to a high speed pellet (HSP) fraction that contains the endoplasmic reticulum and the trans-Golgi network (31Nave B.T.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3819-3826Google Scholar). Upon stimulation with insulin, IRS-1 is preferentially tyrosine-phosphorylated in the intracellular membrane compartment, where it remains for several minutes before translocating to the cytosol (32Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Google Scholar). The distribution of IRS-1 to the same intracellular membrane as SERCA, namely the ER, lends credence to the idea that these two proteins can interact. In addition, there is evidence for a direct interaction of IRS and SERCA proteins. In rat muscle extracts, IRS-1 and IRS-2 were shown to co-immunoprecipitate with SERCA1 and SERCA2a, the skeletal and cardiac muscle isoforms of SERCA (38Algenstaedt P. Antonetti D.A. Yaffe M.B. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23696-23702Google Scholar). Insulin stimulation of the rats resulted in a 2–6-fold increase in the association of IRS proteins with SERCA. IRS-1 and IRS-2 also bound to the ubiquitously expressed SERCA2b isoform, which is also co-expressed with SERCA3 in pancreas (39Váradi A. Molnár E. Östenson C.G. Ashcroft S.J.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 521-527Google Scholar, 40Xu G.G. Gao Z.Y. Borge Jr., P.D. Jegier P.A. Young R.A. Wolf B.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14912-14919Google Scholar). In this current study, we have employed several different techniques to show that IRS-1 and IRS-2 proteins localize to intracellular membranes in pancreatic β-cell lines. More specifically, IRS-1 co-localizes with SERCA3b, one of two SERCA isoforms present in β-cells, to endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomes prepared from β-cells. SERCA3b has also been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with IRS-1 in a model cell line and β-cell lines. This interaction is enhanced with acute insulin stimulation of the cells. Examination of in vitro ER Ca2+ uptake in both wild-type and IRS-1-overexpressing β-cells demonstrates that the β-cell SERCA isoforms function normally and respond to inhibition with thapsigargin in the same fashion. Finally, treatment of wild-type β-cells with thapsigargin resulted in an increase in glucose-stimulated fractional insulin secretion comparable with the increase observed for untreated IRS-1-overexpressing β-cells. These results provide a functional link between the direct IRS-1/SERCA interaction and regulation of calcium homeostasis and insulin secretion. The β-IRS1 cell line and clonal mouse β-cell line βTC6-F7 were cultured as previously described (7Xu G.G. Gao Z.Y. Borge Jr., P.D. Wolf B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18067-18074Google Scholar). In brief, cells were maintained in high glucose DMEM (25 mm glucose; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (complete DMEM) and incubated at 37 °C in a 10% CO2, 90% air humidified incubator. Both cell lines were passaged every 7–10 days and seeded in new T-175 flasks (Falcon, catalog no. 353112) at a cell density of 1:10 (1.0–2.0 × 106 cells/T-175 flask) as follows. The cell lines were washed with 10 ml of Versene and then incubated with 2 ml of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen, catalog no. 25300-054) for 5 min at 37 °C in a 10% CO2, 90% air humidified incubator. The cells were then rinsed with complete DMEM, pelleted, and re-suspended in complete DMEM. Cells were counted and seeded into T-175 flasks as described above. The Chinese hamster ovary-T cell line (CHO-T), which stably expresses the human insulin receptor, was a kind gift from Dr. R. Roth (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA). This cell line was cultured in F-12 (Ham's) medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (complete F-12) and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air humidified incubator. The pMT2-SERCA3b expression plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. F. Wuytack (Laboratorium voor Fysiologie, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium). The pCMV-IRS1 was constructed as described previously (7Xu G.G. Gao Z.Y. Borge Jr., P.D. Wolf B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18067-18074Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against the C terminus of SERCA3b was prepared as follows. A C-terminal peptide of SERCA3b (sequence =C-TGKKGPEVNPGSRGES) that is unique to the SERCA3b splice variant was synthesized by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Biopolymer Facility at Yale University (W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory, Yale University, New Haven, CT) containing an additional N-terminal cysteine (in bold). The peptide was conjugated to the Imject® maleimide-activated SuperCarrier® modulator (Pierce catalog no. 77656) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. The peptide conjugate was then injected into 2 rabbits (Covance Research Products, Inc.) at an initial dose of 0.5 mg followed by a booster dose of 0.25 mg every 21 days for the duration of the study. Bleeds were collected 10 days after each booster dose, and the sera were shipped frozen to our laboratory. The sera were screened for antibody production by Western blot analysis using CHO-T cell lysate from cells transfected with or without the pMT2-SERCA3b plasmid (described below) as positive and negative controls. Sera from bleeds containing SERCA3b antibody were affinity-purified using the Sulfo-Link® kit (Pierce catalog no. 44895) as follows. The SERCA3b peptide antigen was dissolved in Sulfo-Link® Coupling buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm EDTA-Na, pH 8.5) and coupled to a column containing Sulfo-Link® Coupling gel via stable disulfide bonding. Excess free sulfhydryl groups were blocked with the addition of 0.05 m cysteine in Coupling buffer to the column. After washing away excess peptide and cysteine, SERCA3b antibody-containing serum was applied to the column and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The column was washed, and then the SERCA3b antibody was eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.75. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and neutralized by adding 50 μl of 1m Tris, pH 9.5. Fractions containing the SERCA3b antibody (determined by A 280 measured spectrophotometrically and Bio-Rad protein assay) were pooled and dialyzed in PBS with 0.05% sodium azide overnight. The concentration of the SERCA3b antibody solution was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay and A 280 measurements. The solution was aliquoted and frozen at −20 °C. Subcellular fractions were prepared using a modification of the method described by Colca et al. (41Colca J.R. McDonald J.M. Kotagal N. Patke C. Fink C.J. Greider M.H. Lacy P.E. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7223-7228Google Scholar). Both the βTC6-F7 and β-IRS1 were seeded on 15-cm dishes (Falcon, catalog no. 353025) at a cell density of 2.0 × 106 cells/dish and cultured for 7 days as described above. Cells were homogenized on ice in 50 mmMES, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA buffer (Fractionation buffer). The homogenate was centrifuged at 600 ×g for 5 min to yield pellet PM, containing plasma membrane, nuclear material, and debris. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to yield a secretory vesicle and mitochondria-enriched pellet (SV). The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 90 min to yield a HSP, enriched with IM and cytoskeleton. The HSP fraction was re-suspended in fractionation buffer without EDTA. The remaining supernatant, called CYT, contains cytosol. ER enrichment of the HSP was verified by comparing the activity of the ER marker enzyme, NAPDH cytochromec reductase, in the HSP to that in the homogenate. Results indicate a 4-fold enrichment in ER marker enzyme activity (Table I).Table INAPDH cytochrome c reductase activity (-fold enrichment) in β-cell fractionsCell lineHomogenatePMSVHSPCYTβTC6-F71.001.14 ± 0.1704.11 ± 1.09*1.69 ± 0.42β-IRS11.001.14 ± 0.181.39 ± 0.233.39 ± 0.54*2.23 ± 0.80*, p < 0.005.

(UBI) catalog no. 06-248), anti-IRS-2 (UBI catalog no. 06506), and anti-GLUT2 (H-67) (Santa Cruz catalog no. SC-9117) antibodies. Briefly, 40 μg of each fraction and the homogenate were run on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated in a Tris-buffered saline (TBS-T) blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h. The blots were then incubated in 1:500 solutions of anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 antibody in blocking buffer overnight and washed with TBS-T five times for 5 min each the following day. Next, the blots were incubated for 1 h with125I-labeled Protein A (Amersham Biosciences, catalog no. IM144) diluted in blocking buffer. Blots were then washed with TBS-T five times for 5 min each and air-dried. The radiolabeled blots were exposed on a phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences) overnight and analyzed with a PhosphorImager scanner. For immunofluorescence, β-cell lines were seeded on 10-mm poly-d-lysine-coated cover slips in 24-well plates at a cell density of 5 × 104 cells/well. The cells were cultured under the conditions described above for 2 days. Cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 0.5 ml of ice-cold methanol for 10 min and incubated in blocking buffer (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5% FBS) for 10 min. For ER localization, the cover slips were incubated for 1 h with 50 μl of the following antibodies at the indicated dilutions in blocking buffer (5% FBS-PBS): anti-IRS-1 (1:100), anti-IRS-2 (1:100), and anti-BiP/GRP78 (Transduction Laboratories, catalog no. G73320) (1:50). The cover slips were washed with PBS and then incubated for 1 h with 50 μl of secondary antibody solutions in blocking buffer as follows: goat anti-rabbit labeled with cyanine 2 (cy2) (1:500) and/or donkey anti-mouse labeled with Texas Red (TR) (1:500) (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc., catalog no. 111-225-03 and 715-075-150, respectively). For Golgi localization, the same procedures were followed substituting anti-GM130 (Transduction Laboratories, catalog no. G65120) for anti-BiP/GRP78 at a 1:50 dilution. Immunofluorescence-labeled cover slips were mounted onto microscope slides with PermaFluor reagent (Immunon, catalog no. 434980) and analyzed by confocal microscopy in the University of Pennsylvania Diabetes Center Biomedical Imaging Core. Images were captured using the Nikon Eclipse E600 fluorescent microscope and employing a krypton-argon laser as a light source. The Bio-Rad MRC1024 software was used to operate the microscope and laser source. Cross-sectional images through the β-cells were collected in a series of slices 0.10–0.30 μm apart (depending on the total diameter of the cells) from the upper to the lower surface of the cells (∼25–40 image slices/cell group). Each image was collected concurrently at 506 nm (green) and 615 nm (red). The images were analyzed using Confocal AssistantTMversion 4.02 software (copyright 1994–1996, Todd Clark Brelje). Pre-coated nickel grids were floated on a solution of the IM-enriched fraction (HSP) from both βTC6-F7 and β-IRS1 cells for 10 min. The grids were then incubated on 20-μl drops of blocking buffer (1% ovalbumin, 0.2% cold water fish skin gelatin, PBS, pH 7.4) and washed four times with 50 mm Tris, 20 mmglycine for 1 min each. The grids were next incubated on 5-μl drops of the following primary antibody solutions for 60 min: rabbit polyclonal anti-IRS-1 (1:50 dilution), mouse monoclonal anti-IRS-1 (Santa Cruz, catalog no. sc8038) (1:50), anti-SERCA3b (1:500), and anti-BiP/GRP78 (1:200). The incubations were performed for each individual antibody solution alone and in the following combinations: rabbit polyclonal anti-IRS-1 + anti-BiP/GRP78, anti-SERCA3b + anti-BiP/GRP78, and mouse monoclonal anti-IRS-1 + anti-SERCA3b. Grids were washed four times with 0.1% BSA in PBS and incubated with the appropriate combination of species-specific gold-conjugated secondary antibody solutions in 0.1% BSA, acetylated PBS (Aurion, catalog no. 25558) for 45 min. The gold-conjugated secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit conjugated to 18-nm gold particles and anti-mouse conjugated to 5-nm gold particles (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). The grids were then washed four times with 0.1% BSA in PBS for 5 min each and incubated in 1% glutaraldehyde in deionized water for 5 min to stabilize the signal. The grids were washed with deionized water, fixed for 5 min in 1% osmium (in deionized water), and rinsed with deionized water. Finally, all grids were stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate for 5 min and then dried. Grids were examined by electron microscopy at the University of Pennsylvania Diabetes Center Biomedical Imaging Core using the JEOL JEM1010 electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). Images were collected at 80.0 kV and magnification ×120,000. CHO-T cells were seeded in 15-cm dishes and cultured overnight as described above. When cells were 50–70% confluent, they were transiently transfected with pMT2-SERCA3b alone or with pMT2-SERCA3b and pCMV-IRS-1 using the FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, catalog no. 1814443) in a 6:1 FuGENETM 6: total DNA ratio as follows: 90 μl of FuGENETM 6 and 15 μg of pMT-SERCA3b; 180 μl of FuGENETM 6, 15 μg of pMT-SERCA3b, and 15 μg of pCMV-IRS-1. Each reagent mixture was enough to transfect two 15-cm dishes. After 24 h of transfection, cells were incubated in starvation medium (F-12 medium, 0.1% FBS) for 3 h and then treated for 5 min with or without insulin (100 nm). The cells were lysed with Kasuga's lysis buffer (30Yang J. Clarke J.F. Ester C.J. Young P.W. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 125-131Google Scholar) (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mmNa4P2O7, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin) supplemented with 100 μl/10 ml of phosphatase inhibitor mixture 2 (Sigma, catalog no. P-5726). βTC6-F7 and β-IRS1 cells were seeded and cultured to confluence as described above. The cells were washed twice and then incubated with 20 ml of Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB) (115 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.1% BSA for 30 min prior to insulin treatment. The KRB solution was changed, and then the cells were treated with insulin as described above. The protein concentration of the lysates was determined by the Bio-Rad BCA protein assay. Sample aliquots of 500 μg were pre-cleared with 20 μl of a 50% Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B slurry (Amersham Biosciences, catalog no. 71-7090-00). The samples were incubated overnight with anti-IRS-1, anti-SERCA3b, pre-immune serum, or normal rabbit serum. Immune complexes were pulled down with 40 μl of the 50% Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B slurry overnight, washed twice with Wash Buffer 1 (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl), and then washed twice with Wash Buffer 2 (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS). Laemmli buffer (with 3 mg/ml dithiothreitol) was added to the samples, which were then analyzed by Western blot using the anti-IRS-1 and anti-SERCA3b antibodies. Calcium uptake was measured as described previously (41Colca J.R. McDonald J.M. Kotagal N. Patke C. Fink C.J. Greider M.H. Lacy P.E. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7223-7228Google Scholar). 45CaCl2 (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Catalog no. 62005) was used as a tracer of calcium uptake. Standard final assay solution conditions were as follows: 50 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm oxalate, 68.5 μm CaCl2 total Ca2+ (10 μm free Ca2+, 1.0–2.0 μCi of 45CaCl2), ± 1.25 mm ATP, pH 6.8, at 37 °C.

An extensive mutagenesis analysis of the p115RhoGEF rgRGS domain was undertaken to determine its functional interface with the Gα13 subunit. Results indicate that there is global resemblance between the interaction surface of the rgRGS domain with Gα13 and the interactions of RGS4 and RGS9 with their Gα substrates. However, there are distinct differences in the distribution of functionally critical residues between these structurally similar surfaces and an additional essential requirement for a cluster of negatively charged residues at the N terminus of rgRGS. Lack of sequence conservation within the N terminus may also explain the lack of GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity in a subset of the rgRGS domains. For all mutations, loss of functional GAP activity is paralleled by decreases in binding to Gα13. The same mutations, when placed in the context of the p115RhoGEF molecule, produce deficiencies in GAP activity as observed with the rgRGS domain alone but show no attenuation of the regulation of Rho exchange activity by Gα13. This suggests that the rgRGS domain may serve a structural or allosteric role in the regulation of the nucleotide exchange activity of p115RhoGEF on Rho by Gα13.

The catalytic activity of these GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) resides in an ∼120-residue α-helical domain that corresponds to a consensus “RGS box” defined by amino acid sequence similarity. RGS box sequences show considerable diversity and can be subdivided into distinct homologous clusters (4Zheng B. De Vries L. Farquhar M.G. Trends Biochem.

These proteins contain regions in their N-terminal halves with low sequence identity to RGS domains (14Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C.

In contrast to other RGS proteins, p115RhoGEF requires elements outside of the RGS box to function as a GAP. A construct that extends about 75 residues beyond the C terminus of the RGS box is the smallest fragment of the holoprotein which could be overexpressed as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli, although as little as 50 additional C-terminal residues allowed expression of a functional domain in eukaryotic cells. In addition to an extended C terminus, 25 residues that precede the RGS box were also required for full GAP activity (15Wells C.D. Liu M.Y. Jackson M. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.M. Rothstein J.D.

Zhou X.B. Kleuss C. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28500-28506Google Scholar) studies have defined three distinct regions of the RGS domain which interact with Gα and convey GAP activity. These correspond to two surface polypeptide turns that join helical segments, together with the surface of the C-terminal α helix of the RGS domain. These RGS elements directly contact the catalytic site of Gα, principally, the switch I and switch II segments that undergo conformational rearrangement upon hydrolysis of GTP (20Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Google Scholar). Together, these two segments in Gα subunits contain residues that participate directly in the catalytic mechanism of GTP hydrolysis or bind the magnesium ion cofactor (21Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Google Scholar, 22Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Google Scholar). The complex formed by GDP, Mg2+, and AlF 4−, which promotes an activated state of Gα (23Sternweis P.C. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4888-4891Google Scholar), also mimics the pentacoordinate transition state for GTP hydrolysis (21Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Google Scholar, 22Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Google Scholar). RGS proteins have been shown to bind more strongly to the GDP·Mg2+·AlF 4− complexes of Gα subunits than to those formed with GTP analogs (24Berman D.M. Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27209-27212Google Scholar). This, together with structural evidence, indicates that RGS proteins accelerate GTP hydrolysis by stabilizing a transition state-like conformation of Gα or destabilize the GTP-bound ground state (25Coleman D.E. Sprang S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16669-16672Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the N-terminally truncated rgRGS domain of p115RhoGEF (26Chen Z. Wells C.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 805-809Google Scholar) and that of its homolog, PDZRhoGEF (27Longenecker K.L. Lewis M.E. Chikumi H. Gutkind J.S. Derewenda Z.S. Structure. 2001; 9: 559-569Google Scholar), were recently determined. These domains are comprised of 11 α helices; the N-terminal 7 helices form a bilobal fold similar to that in classic RGS domains. The remaining 4 helices pack against the latter to generate a single globular domain. The core of the rgRGS domain from p115RhoGEF, which encompasses two of the three segments involved in Gα binding, shows high structural similarity to the corresponding segments in RGS proteins of known structure. Accordingly, mutation of two p115RhoGEF residues that correspond, in RGS4, to side chains that interact with switch I and switch II, were found to diminish GAP activity (26Chen Z. Wells C.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 805-809Google Scholar). These observations led to the inference that the general features of the protein-protein interface observed in the published structures of RGS·Gα complexes are likely be preserved in the interaction of rgRGS with Gα13. Although the N terminus of p115RhoGEF is not present in the crystal structure, it is required for GAP activity (15Wells C.D. Liu M.Y. Jackson M. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.M. Rothstein J.D. Kozasa T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1174-1181Google Scholar), and structural modeling of the rgRGS·Gα13 complex suggests that N-terminal residues of the rgRGS domain might interact with the helical domain and switch regions of Gα13(26Chen Z. Wells C.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 805-809Google Scholar). Here, we describe an extensive mutagenic analysis performed to define the residues in the rgRGS domain which interact with Gα13and convey GAP activity. These studies focused on both the globular helical domain of the rgRGS and the N-terminal residues that precede the RGS box. Results indicate that there is global resemblance between the interaction surface of the rgRGS domain with Gα13 and the interactions of RGS4 and RGS9 for their Gα substrates. However, there are distinct differences in the distribution of functionally critical residues between these structurally similar surfaces and an additional essential requirement for a cluster of negatively charged residues at the N terminus of rgRGS. Placement of the same mutations in the context of the p115RhoGEF molecule produces the same deficiencies in GAP activity as observed with the rgRGS domain alone but shows no attenuation of the regulation of Rho exchange activity by Gα13. Complementary DNA oligomers encoding single or double amino acid changes from the wild type p115RhoGEF gene were used to generate point mutants by PCR. The mutagenesis template consisted of amino acids 1–252 of human p115RhoGEF (rgRGS domain) subcloned into the pGEX-KG vector. The sequences of primers used are available upon request. The QuikChange Kit™ from Stratagene was used in a four-step procedure to generate mutant cDNA. Plasmids encoding the desired mutations were selected and verified by sequencing. Selected mutated rgRGS DNAs were also subcloned into the full-length p115RhoGEF gene in the pFastbac1 vector (Invitrogen), which has been modified to provide an N-terminal EE tag (EYMPME) (8Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Google Scholar) for production of baculovirus and subsequent expression in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. All p115RhoGEF proteins were expressed in transformed BL21 (DE3) or DΗ5α strains of E. coli or in cultured Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. The rgRGS domains were produced in E. coli as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C toA 600 ∼0.6 and induced for 3 h at 30 °C with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thiogalactopyranoside for expression of mutant proteins. Bacteria were then pelleted by centrifugation and lysed for 30 min in solution A (25 mmNaHepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 21 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 21 μg/mlNa-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 21 μg/ml tosylphenylalanyl ketone, and 21 μg/mlNa-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester)) containing 2 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mg/ml DNase I, and 5 mm MgCl2. GST-tagged rgRGS proteins were purified by chromatography through glutathione-Sepharose 4B (AmershamBiosciences) in solution A and elution with solution A containing 15 mm reduced glutathione. Full-length p115RhoGEFs containing mutated rgRGS domains were expressed in Sf9 cells during 48 h of infection with recombinant baculoviruses. The expressed proteins were purifed from lysates by chromatography with immobilized antibodies to the EE tag (BabCO) as described elsewhere (8Hart M.J. Sharma S. elMasry N. Qiu R.G. McCabe P. Polakis P. Bollag G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25452-25458Google Scholar). Gα13 was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described previously (28Wells C. Jiang X. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.C. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 371-382Google Scholar). RhoA was expressed in Sf9 cells with an N-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag and purified from lysates by isolation with Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid resin (Qiagen) in 25 mm NaHepes, pH 7.5, 2.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors. Elution was facilitated by a step gradient of increasing imidazole concentration, with His6-RhoA being released at ∼75 mm. 2 μmGα13 was loaded with 5 μm[γ-32P]GTP (50–100 cpm/fmol) for 15 min at 30 °C in solution B (20 mm NaHepes, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% polyoxyethylene 10 lauryl ether (Lubrol)). Free [γ-32P]GTP and32Pi were removed rapidly by centrifugation of the samples at 4 °C through Sephadex G-50 that had been equilibrated with solution B. Hydrolysis of GTP was initiated by adding Gα13 loaded with [γ-32P]GTP (final concentration of 1–5 nm) to solution B containing 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm GTP, and 1–100 nm p115RhoGEF rgRGS domain (wild type or mutant) in a 50-μl reaction volume. After incubation for the indicated times at 4 °C, reactions were quenched with 750 μl of 5% (w/v) NoritA in 50 mm NaH2PO4. The mixtures were then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, and 400 μl of supernatant containing 32Pi was counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The purified GST-tagged rgRGS domains were bound to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (packed beads) by gentle mixing in 200 μl of solution C (20 mmNaHepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl) for 30 min at 4 °C. During that time, Gα13 was diluted to 2 μmin solution D (20 mm NaHepes, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm GDP, and 0.05% Lubrol) and then gel filtered rapidly by centrifugation through Sephadex G-50 that had been equilibrated with the same solution. This removes residual activating ligands in the preparation. Samples of glutathione-Sepharose 4B containing bound GST-tagged rgRGS proteins were then pelleted in a microfuge for 30 s and washed with 200 μl of solution D to remove unbound protein. 200-μl binding reactions were prepared by mixing the immobilized rgRGS proteins and gel-filtered Gα13 in solution D either with or without AMF (30 μm AlCl3, 5 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm NaF). Samples were mixed gently for 30 min at 4 °C, and unbound Gα13 was then removed by two 200-μl washes of solution D either with or without AMF. The washed beads were finally resuspended with 40 μl of solution D and then boiled in SDS sample buffer. Structural modeling of the rgRGS·Gα13 complex predicted that residues of loops L3, L5, helix α8, and loop L11 would interact with the switch regions of Gα13 (Fig. 1 A) (26Chen Z. Wells C.D. Sternweis P.C. Sprang S.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 805-809Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we mutated residues located within this predicted interaction surface of the p115RhoGEF rgRGS domain and measured the GAP activity of the mutant domains toward Gα13. Unless stated otherwise, “p115rgRGS” refers to the protein fragment encompassing residues 1–252 of p115RhoGEF. Mutations are identified by the one-letter code for the residue in wild type p115rgRGS, followed by the position of the residue in the amino acid sequence and the one-letter code for the residue to which it was mutated (e.g. E71A has glutamic acid in position 71 mutated to an alanine). Residues chosen for mutagenesis (Fig. 1 B) fall into three categories. The first group includes residues predicted to form direct and specific contacts with the switch regions of Gα13, according to structural modeling studies of the rgRGS·Gα13 complex (Glu-71, Arg-111, Pro-113, Pro-115, Pro-116, Glu-155, and Lys-214). The second group of residues in the predicted interface region includes those that are charged, have solvent accessible surface areas greater than 25 Å2, and are conserved in the rgRGS domains but not in the classical RGS proteins (Gln-69, Asp-156, Lys-160, Arg-161, Glu-212, and Glu-213). A third group of residues includes surface residues that are predicted to project toward, but not necessarily contact, switch regions of Gα13 (Phe-70, Arg-152, and Ser-159). In most instances, residues were mutated to alanine or residues with opposite charge. Three of the mutations, F70A, P113K, and R152E, were also designed to reflect the differences in sequence between p115RhoGEF and two rgRGS-containing proteins with little or no GAP activity, GTRAP48 and PDZRhoGEF. None of the residues chosen for mutagenesis is involved in extensive packing interactions. Hence, alterations of these residues are therefore not expected to disrupt the tertiary structure of p115rgRGS. Initial experiments were conducted with constructs encompassing only the p115rgRGS domain (residues 1–252). 21 mutated p115rgRGS domains were expressed in E. coli. All of the mutants were expressed at a high level (>1 mg/liter) and as soluble proteins (data not shown) as would be expected for properly folded protein domains. The GAP activities of the recombinant p115rgRGS mutants were measured by the single turnover GTPase assay for Gα13 (see “Materials and Methods”). Examples of these assays, which assessed the effect of 10 nm mutant p115rgRGS protein on the time dependence at 4 °C of hydrolysis of GTP bound to Gα13, are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. At this concentration and conditions, the wild type rgRGS domain stimulated the GTPase activity of Gα13 by ∼5–10-fold and caused almost complete hydrolysis of the bound GTP by 2 min. The total amount of GTP hydrolyzed differed from assay to assay, largely because of variations in GTP loading caused by weak nucleotide affinity and the high intrinsic GTPase rate of Gα13 (29Singer W.D. Miller R.T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19796-19802Google Scholar); thus, the final concentration of [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Gα13 used in the assays ranged from 1 to 10 nm. A summary of the results with the 21 mutant domains tested under the conditions described above is shown in Fig. 2 C. Several mutations, including R111A, E155K, E212A, E213A, K214A, and K214E, had no effect on GAP activity. In contrast, three mutations, Q69A, F70A, and D156A, appear largely to abolish GAP activity, whereas other mutations had more modest effects (apparent decreases in GAP activity of 20–60% of the wild type domain). GAP activities of mutants designed to target specific Gα13 interaction sites are consistent with the involvement of the structurally conserved L3 and L5 loops and also the less well conserved helix, α8. However, the lack of effects by mutations in L11 from the C-terminal helical region does not support a role for this structural element in the GAP activity of the rgRGS domain. The L3 loop of the rgRGS domain is a likely site for interaction with Gα13, yet its conformation differs from that of RGS4. The group 1 residue in this loop, Glu-71, is proposed to engage in electrostatic and van der Waals interactions with Lys-204 of Gα13 and is conserved among rgRGS proteins (Fig.1 B). Accordingly, mutants in which Glu-71 was replaced by either alanine or lysine have 50% of the GAP activity toward Gα13 compared with the wild type rgRGS domain (Fig.2 C). Nonconservative mutations of the group 2 and group 3 residues in L3, Q69A, and F70A, respectively, caused large reductions in GAP activity. Both residues are exposed to solvent and are in close proximity to switch I of Gα13 in the model of the rgRGS·Gα13 complex, although their interaction partners cannot be predicted. Gln-69 is absolutely conserved among known rgRGS proteins (Fig. 1 B), whereas Phe-70 is conserved only in p115RhoGEF, Lsc, and LARG, but replaced by alanine in PDZRhoGEF and GTRAP48. The potential interactive role of this residue is supported by the retention of about 50% of GAP activity by the conservative mutation of Phe-70 to tyrosine. Structural and mutagenic studies of RGS proteins indicate that the residue corresponding to Asn-128 in RGS4 is important for GAP activity. A proline residue occupies the analogous position (residue 113 in p115RhoGEF) in the rgRGS domains with strong GAP activity but is replaced by lysine in GTRAP48 (Fig. 1 B). Mutation of Pro-113 in L5 to either an alanine or a lysine reduces GAP activity (Fig.2 C), but the effect is not as severe as that caused by mutations in the L3 or α8 regions. Other mutations of group 1 residues in L5, including R111A and P115G/P116G, had little effect on GAP activity (Fig. 2 C). Residues outside the α3-L5 core region of the rgRGS domain align poorly in tertiary structure with RGS4. Therefore, although α8 is a probable interaction partner for switch I of Gα13, only one residue in this helix, Glu-155, could be included in group 1. Mutation of this residue had little effect on GAP activity. In contrast, mutation of one of the two neighboring group 2 residues, Arg-152, reduced GAP activity by 50%. Arg-152 is replaced by glutamate in PDZRhoGEF and GTRAP48, two rgRGS proteins with very weak GAP activity toward Gα13. Replacing Arg-152 with glutamate in p115rgRGS resulted in only a modest reduction in activity similar to replacement with alanine. Three charged group 3 residues were selected for mutagenesis in α8. Of these, substitution of Asp-156, a residue in α8 which is conserved among rgRGS proteins (Fig. 1 B), severely reduced GAP activity. However, structure-based modeling reveals no residues in Gα13 poised to interact directly with Asp-156 in the rgRGS domain. Mutation of other charged residues in α8, Glu-155, Ser-159, and Arg-161, had little effect. To elucidate the extent to which certain mutations affect GAP activity of the rgRGS domain, we measured the quantity of GTP hydrolyzed by Gα13 within a 2-min period as a function of rgRGS concentration (Fig. 2 D). At a sufficiently high concentration, all of the mutated rgRGS domains were capable of stimulating Gα13 to the extent observed for the wild type domain. Thus, the D156A, Q69A, and F70A mutations do not substantially alter the efficacy of rgRGS as a GAP for Gα13, but strongly reduce the potency of the domain for this function. Even the most debilitated mutant, p115rgRGS (D156A), exhibited GAP activity that was comparable with that of the wild type protein at concentrations that were 100–1,000-fold greater than Gα13 in the assay. In Fig.3 A, the solvent-accessible surface of rgRGS is color-coded according to the relative loss of GAP activity that results from mutation of the underlying residues. The relative GAP activity of a mutant p115rgRGS domain is quantified as the apparent initial velocity of the GTPase reaction catalyzed by Gα13 in the presence of the mutant normalized by the rate in the presence of wild type p115rgRGS (%V 0WT) (for examples, see Fig. 2,A and B). The mutagenesis data identify a functionally critical surface on the rgRGS domain which is centered on three key residues from the RGS box: Gln-69 and Phe-70 from L3, and Asp-156 from α8. The functional map of rgRGS is grossly similar to that of RGS4 as charted by Srinivasa and colleagues (16Srinivasa S.P. Watson N. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1529-1533Google Scholar) (Fig.3 B) but differs in the extent to which mutations at corresponding positions affect GAP activity. For example, mutation of Asn-128 in the L5 loop of RGS4 severely impairs GAP activity, whereas the corresponding P113A mutation is only modestly debilitating in rgRGS. Conversely, the Q69A and F70A substitutions generate severe effects in rgRGS, whereas mutation of the structurally equivalent residues in RGS4 only reduce GAP activity to ∼30% of wild type. On the other hand, Asp-156 in rgRGS and Arg-167 in RGS4 occupy equivalent positions in α8, and both are critical for GAP activity of the respective domains. Residues 15–41 of p115rgRGS are required for GAP activity toward Gα13 (15Wells C.D. Liu M.Y. Jackson M. Gutowski S. Sternweis P.M. Rothstein J.D. Kozasa T. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1174-1181Google Scholar). This region contains a hydrophobic sequence followed by a 16-residue segment containing 9 acidic residues (Figs. 1 B and 8 A). Within this region, sequence conservation between p115RhoGEF and GTRAP48, which possesses only weak GAP activity, is low, and fewer negatively charged side chains are present in GTRAP48. To define the contribution of residues within the acidic sequences to the GAP activity of rgRGS, a series of single site mutations was generated within the segment extending from residue 27 to residue 45. Also included for mutagenesis were 2 amino acids at the N-terminal border of the functional rgRGS domain, Ser-14 and Arg-15. Within this set, negatively charged glutamic acid residues were mutated to lysine; the remaining amino acids were mutated to alanine. All of the mutant p115rgRGS domains could be expressed as soluble proteins inE. coli and were assayed for GAP activity toward Gα13 as described above. Residues 27–31 were identified as crucial to the GAP activity of the rgRGS domain. Mutation of Glu-27 or Glu-29 to lysine severely impaired GAP activity (Fig. 4,A and B) as did the mutation of Asp-28 or Phe-31 to alanine. Mutations of the charged residues immediately flanking this segment reduced GAP activity to ∼50% that of wild type, whereas mutations of residues 40–45 had no effect. Substitution of Ser-14 and Arg-15 did not reduce GAP activity appreciably. The concentration dependence of GAP activity was also measured for p115rgRGS bearing single mutations in residues 27–31 (Fig. 4 D). In contrast to mutations within the RGS box region, mutation of these residues appeared to reduce efficacy as well as potency severely.Figure 4Effect of mutations within the N terminus of p115rgRGS on GAP activity.

VPAC2 activation enhances glucose-induced insulin release while VPAC1 activation elevates glucose output. To generate a large pool of VPAC2 selective agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, structure-activity relationship studies were performed on PACAP, VIP, and a VPAC2 selective VIP analog. Chemical modifications on this analog that prevent recombinant expression were sequentially removed to show that a recombinant peptide would retain VPAC2 selectivity. An efficient recombinant expression system was then developed to produce and screen hundreds of mutant peptides. The 11 mutations found on the VIP analog were systematically replaced with VIP or PACAP sequences. Three of these mutations, V19A, L27K, and N28K, were sufficient to provide most of the VPAC2 selectivity. C-terminal extension with the KRY sequence from PACAP38 led to potent VPAC2 agonists with improved selectivity (100–1000-fold). Saturation mutagenesis at positions 19, 27, 29, and 30 of VIP and charge-scanning mutagenesis of PACAP27 generated additional VPAC2 selective agonists.

Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Minamino N. Uehara A. Jiang L. Culler M.D. Coy D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar) by following pituitary adenylate cyclase activation, belongs to the secretin/glucagon/vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) family of peptides (2Sherwood N.M. Krueckl S.L. McRory J.E. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 619-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). These peptides are expressed as part of larger proteins that are processed by proteolysis followed by C-terminal amidation to generate the mature amidated peptides (Fig.1). PACAP exists as a 38-residue form (PACAP38), and as a shorter form corresponding to the N-terminal 27 amino acids of PACAP38 (PACAP27). Both forms of PACAP bind to and activate the G-protein-coupled receptors PAC1, VPAC1, and VPAC2, whereas the related 28-mer peptide VIP only recognizes VPAC1 and VPAC2 (3Laburthe M. Couvineau A. Regul. Pept. 2002; 108: 165Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Activation of multiple receptors by PACAP or VIP has broad physiological effects on nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, reproductive, muscular, and immune systems (4Gozes I. Fridkinb M. Hill J.M. Brenneman D.E. Curr. Med. Chem. 1999; 6: 1019-1034PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, clinical applications will require selective activation of a particular receptor to minimize potential side effects mediated by the other receptors. For example, we have previously demonstrated that VPAC2 activation induces glucose-dependent insulin secretion without the undesired side effects mediated by VPAC1 such as watery diarrhea (5Tsutsumi M. Claus T.H. Liang Y. Li Y. Yang L. Zhu J. Dela Cruz F. Peng X. Chen H. Yung S.L. Hamren S. Livingston J.N. Pan C.Q. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1453-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Therefore, to provide a potential therapy for type 2 diabetes, VPAC2 selectivity is an absolute requirement. We sought to identify key determinants of VPAC2 selectivity and generate a peptide with the minimum number of mutations. However, structure-function relationship studies on VIP and PACAP (6Gourlet P.

Recombinant expression of these peptides has been difficult because they are rapidly degraded during expression and thus require expression as a fusion with a protein followed by specific proteolytic cleavage to release the peptide. Previous attempts using this approach have yielded limited success because the released peptide carried additional amino acids that reduced activity (16Simoncsits A. Tjornhammar M.L. Kalman M.

Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the current study, we have developed an efficient recombinant expression system that can produce peptides without any exogenous amino acids. This has allowed us to perform an extensive structure-activity relationship study of PACAP, VIP, and a VPAC2 selective analog (18Gourlet P. Vertongen P. Vandermeers A. Vandermeers-Piret M.C. Rathe J. De Neef P. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Peptides. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and we report the first recombinant production of VPAC2 selective agonists. Chemically synthesized peptides PACAP27, PACAP38, VIP, R3P1 to R3P17, R3P33, R3P55, R3P60, R3P66, and PAC1 to PAC27 were supplied by Sigma Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). The cyclized peptide Ro 25-1553 was supplied by SynPep (Dublin, CA). All peptides were shown to be >95% pure by reverse-phase analytical high performance liquid chromatography and confirmed to have the predicted mass by mass spectrometry. Most mutant DNA were generated by site-directed PCR mutagenesis using VIP or R3P3, as the template, and oligonucleotides containing codons corresponding to the desired mutations (19Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The VIP and R3P3 templates were created by hybridizing two synthesized overlapping DNA fragments (Invitrogen) encoding the VIP or R3P3 peptide fused to a Factor Xa recognition site at its N terminus, followed by DNA extension with the large fragment of DNA polymerase I (Invitrogen). Some mutant peptides were created using more related sequences as templates. For example, R3P52 to R3P55 were generated using R3P51 as the template, while R3P56 to R3P59 were generated using R3P41 as the template. All mutant peptides were cloned into pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) through BamHI andXhoI sites, or BamHI and EcoRI sites, and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Stratagene). Cloning into pGEX-6P-1 in the above manner resulted in the fusion of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein N-terminal to the peptide, enabling the purification of the fusion protein by virtue of the interaction of GST with glutathione. For saturation mutagenesis, site-directed PCR mutagenesis of the R3P53 template was performed with a mutated oligonucleotide primer containing the codons NN(G/C) to randomize amino acids of R3P65 at residues 19, 27, 29, or 30 one position at a time. The four mutant pools (one for each position) were cloned into pGEX-6P-1 as individual pools throughBamHI and EcoRI sites and transformed intoE. coli XL-1 blue cells (Stratagene). Single clones (96 for each position) were isolated and grown up in 96-well plates for DNA purification, using the BioRobot 9600 (Qiagen), and sequence verification. Confirmed mutations were then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for expression. This initial random mutagenesis recovered most of the 19 possible mutations (17/19, 19/19, 13/19, and 17/19 mutations at positions 19, 27, 29, and 30, respectively) and thus greatly reduced the number of site-directed mutagenesis reactions needed. The DNA for the remaining 10 mutant peptides was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (see above). For combinatorial mutant DNA generation (R3P174 to R3P193), PCR site-directed mutagenesis of templates R3P101 (A19G-R3P65), R3P104 (A19K-R3P65), R3P110 (A19R-R3P65), and R3P111 (A19S-R3P65) was done with oligonucleotides containing codons corresponding to the desired mutations at positions 27, 29, and 30. The mutant DNA was cloned into pGEX-6P-1 through BamHI and EcoRI sites, and single clones were isolated and expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3) cells. For saturation and combinatorial mutant peptides of R3P65, only 40-ml of E. coli for expression was needed, whereas for the other mutant peptides 0.5–1 liter was necessary. Cells were grown at 37 °C. At an OD600 of 0.6–1.0, the cells were induced at a final concentration of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) for 1–2 h. Cells were spun at 7,700 × g for 15 min and frozen at −20 °C. Per 20 ml of culture, the frozen cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of B-PER (Pierce) with 20 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 50 μg of lysozyme (AmershamBiosciences) and sonicated 3–6 times for 1 min with 15 s breaks on ice. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. 20 μl of 75% glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) was thoroughly washed in phosphate-buffered saline and mixed with the lysate on a shaker overnight at 4 °C. The resin was collected from the lysate by centrifugation at 1,500 ×g for 15 min, packed into a Poly-sep column (Bio-Rad), washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline followed by 0.3 ml of Factor Xa buffer (1 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The peptides were cleaved off the column during an overnight incubation at 4 °C by the addition of 1 unit of Factor Xa (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.2 ml of Factor Xa buffer. For saturation and combinatorial mutant peptides of R3P65, the resulting Factor Xa eluate was used for cell assays. The other mutant peptides were further purified by C18 reverse phase-HPLC (Dynamax 300A C18 column, Rainin, Beckman System Gold HPLC) using a 2-ml loop and flow rate of 2 ml/min with the following program: 10 min of 95% Buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H20), 30 min of a linear gradient to 100% Buffer B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile). Peak fractions (1 ml each) were collected. Peptide-containing fractions were lyophilized for storage and resuspended in sterile water or phosphate-buffered saline for assays. Mutant peptides so purified typically ran as a single band on 10–20% Tricine SDS-PAGE (Novex) stained in Gel Code Blue (Pierce). Typical yields of final purified peptide were 1 mg per liter of culture. Expression and purification yield was limited mainly by proteolysis at Lys-21/Lys-22 during expression of these peptides in E. coli (data not shown). Fig. 2 illustrates a typical purification of peptide R3P3. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was used to determine the purity and concentration and to confirm the predicted mass of the saturation and combinatorial mutant peptides of R3P65. A Michrom 2002 LC was used to generate a standard curve with synthetically produced R3P66. Varying amounts of this peptide (over a range from 10 to 80 pmol) were loaded onto a 0.3 × 150 mm column with Magic C18 beads (5 μ, 300 Å). The gradient (solvent A = 5% acetonitrile, 0.4% acetic acid, 0.005% HFBA; solvent B = 100% acetonitrile, 0.4% acetic acid, 0.005% HFBA) went from 5–60% B over 20 min at a flow rate of ∼6 μl/min. UV detection was set at 214 nm. Using the Magic 2002 software, the goodness of fit of the linear standard curve (R2) was calculated to be 0.9971. Each recombinant mutant peptide was then loaded onto the Magic 2002 LC using the method described above and quantitation was achieved by analyzing the peptide peak against the calibration curve. To confirm the expected mass of each peptide, the eluting peptides were run directly from the HPLC column into a Finnigan LCQ Classic mass spectrometer. Using an electrospray ionization source and a method consisting of full MS over a scan range of 650–850 Da followed by data-dependent MS-MS, each peptide was analyzed. The mass for each peptide was obtained using Navigator 1.2 and Excalibur software as recommended by the manufacturer. For all other mutant peptides, peptide molecular weight was confirmed by mass spectrometry performed on a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager RP MALDI-TOF using the vendors suggested analysis conditions or a Hewlett Packard Model 59987A API-Electrospray LC/MS Interface with a Model 5989B MS Engine by way of a Hewlett Packard 1050 pump with a solution of 50% methyl alcohol/water and 1% acetic acid. Amino acid analysis confirmed amino acid composition of all mutant peptides (Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc). Analysis was performed by hydrolysis in 6n HCl, then applied through an amino acid analyzer, typically accurate within <2%. PACAP competition binding and cAMP accumulation assay were performed as described previously (5Tsutsumi M. Claus T.H. Liang Y. Li Y. Yang L. Zhu J. Dela Cruz F. Peng X. Chen H. Yung S.L. Hamren S. Livingston J.N. Pan C.Q. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1453-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The only available VPAC2 selective agonists are two cyclized synthetic analogs of VIP (18Gourlet P. Vertongen P. Vandermeers A. Vandermeers-Piret M.C. Rathe J. De Neef P. Waelbroeck M. Robberecht P. Peptides. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 20Xia M. Sreedharan S.P. Bolin D.R. Gaufo G.O. Goetzl E.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 281: 629-633PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether a recombinant VPAC2-selective peptide can be made, the four chemical modifications of one of them, Ro 25-1553 (21Bolin D.R. Michalewsky J. Wasserman M.A. O'Donnell M. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), were sequentially removed and tested in radioligand competition binding and cAMP activation assay (see Table I, R3P1 to R3P3). All three peptides, including the recombinant expression compatible R3P3, retained good VPAC2 agonist activity and selectivity in the binding and activation assay. Therefore, a peptide with high potency and selectivity toward VPAC2 can be made recombinantly.Table IMutagenesis of VIP to generate highly selective VPAC2 mutant peptides with minimal number of mutations Open table in a new tab VIP mutant peptides were expressed as C-terminal fusions to gluathione S-transferase with a Factor Xa recognition site inserted immediately N-terminal to the desired peptide sequence. Factor Xa cleavage yielded recombinant peptides that were identical to their synthetic counterparts. Both synthetic and recombinant R3P3, R3P9, R3P12, R3P33, R3P55, and R3P60 peptides were generated. In every case, recombinantly produced peptides were shown to be identical by mass spectrometry, amino acid analysis, competition binding assay (for example, see R3P3 in Fig.3), and cAMP assay (data not shown) to their corresponding synthetic counterparts. Since functional screening for receptor selectivity required microgram amounts of peptides, this expression system provided an efficient and rapid method for analyzing a large number of mutant peptides and was utilized for subsequent rounds of mutagenesis. Although R3P3 was selective for VPAC2, it contained 11 mutations from VIP, any one of which could contribute to VPAC2 selectivity. A series of 13 peptides (R3P5 to R3P17) were designed to reduce the number of candidate VPAC2 selective positions (see Tables I and II). Mutant peptides generated using PACAP as the template (R3P6, R3P15-R3P17) exhibited a significant loss in VPAC1 activity but a greater selectivity for PAC1 rather than VPAC2 (see Table II). The significant VPAC2 selectivity displayed by R3P8 but not R3P10 confirms the importance of Lys-27 and Lys-28 mutations for VPAC2 selectivity over VPAC1 (see Table I). The role of Glu-8 and Leu-26 mutations in the context of Lys-27 and Lys-28 was less clear since R3P7 did not show any VPAC2 selectivity. R3P5, R3P12, and R3P13 appeared to be the most VPAC2 selective mutant peptides out of this second round of mutagenesis, suggesting that the removal of conservative mutations, Glu-8, Lys-12, and Leu-26 found in R3P3, did not affect VPAC2 selectivity. Ending the C terminus with the GGT sequence as in the case of R3P9 and R3P12 led to slightly greater VPAC2 selectivity than C-terminal amidation as found in R3P8 and R3P13. Therefore, R3P12 was chosen as the lead peptide out of this round of mutagenesis.Table IIMutagenesis of PACAP to generate VPAC2 selective mutant peptides Open table in a new tab The lead peptide R3P12 from Round 2 was systematically analyzed by exchanging each mutated residue with the wild-type amino acids and by introducing these mutations into VIP individually. R3P20 to R3P30 were designed to determine the individual and combinatorial effects of the five mutations in the body of VIP by converting the R3P12 amino acids found at these positions back to those of VIP (see Table I). Changing Leu-17 and Asp-25 back to the native VIP amino acids individually as in R3P20 and R3P22 or in combination as in R3P26 do not significantly affect VPAC2 selectivity, suggesting that these two mutations do not contribute to VPAC2 selectivity. The Lys-27 mutation appears to be a major VPAC2 selectivity determinant since exchanging it for the wild-type leucine residue in R3P23, R3P27, and R3P28 greatly reduces VPAC2 selectivity in the binding assay. The Ala-19 mutation appears to play a moderate role in VPAC2 selectivity because exchanging it for the wild-type valine residue in R3P21, R3P25, R3P28, and R3P29 lowers VPAC2 selectivity to a lesser degree than the Lys-27 mutation. The importance of the Lys-28 mutation is more context-dependent because removing it alone in R3P24 has only a minor effect on VPAC2 selectivity but taking it out together with Lys-27 (R3P27), Ala-19 (R3P29), or Asp-25 (R3P30) leads to signification reduction in VPAC2 selectivity. Introducing these five mutations: Leu-17 (R3P46), Ala-19 (R3P47), Asp-25 (R3P48), Lys-27 (R3P42), Lys-28 (R3P43) into VIP individually did not result in VPAC2 selectivity, suggesting VPAC2 selectivity requires the combinatorial effect at least two mutations. Combining the three likely VPAC2 selective mutations Ala-19, Lys-27, and Lys-28 into a single R3P51 peptide resulted in a VPAC2 selective agonist that has only three mutations from VIP, yet displayed similar VPAC2 selectivity as the 11-mutation R3P3, the recombinant version of the cyclized VIP analog Ro 25-1553. All three of these mutations are necessary since peptides containing any two of the mutations, R3P41 (Lys-27/Lys-28), R3P49 (Ala-19/Lys-27), or R3P50 (Ala-19/Lys-28) exhibited much lower VPAC2 selectivity. Peptides R3P37 to R3P40 were designed to generate VPAC2 selective agonists using PACAP as the template (see Table II). Although there was a general trend of preference for VPAC2 over VPAC1 displayed by R3P37 and R3P38, either no preference (R3P37) or only slight preference (R3P38) for VPAC2 over PAC1 was exhibited. When only Lys-27 and Lys-28 mutations were introduced into PACAP27 (R3P40), no significant VPAC2 selectivity was detected. Adding the Leu-17 mutation (R3P39) also did not lead to VPAC2 selectivity. Similar to the PACAP mutant peptides in Round 2, these two peptides may possess selective PAC1 agonist activity as demonstrated in the cAMP assay. Peptides R3P31 to R3P36 were designed to decipher the role of the C-terminal GGT sequence. We sequentially removed this sequence (R3P31 to R3P33) and built the peptide back up to 31 residues with other amino acids (R3P34 to R3P36) while fixing the five other mutations (Leu-17, Ala-19, Asp-25, Lys-27, and Lys-28). Glutamine (Q) was appended to R3P33 to generate R3P34 while the NQ sequence was added to R3P33 to create R3P35 because these amino acids are favored at the C termini of helices (22Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). To extend the peptide to 31 residues, we chose to graft residues 29–31 of PACAP38 onto R3P33 resulting in peptide R3P36. All of these peptides displayed excellent VPAC2 selectivity (see Table I) suggesting that a 28-residue peptide without C-terminal amidation, such as R3P33, can be as VPAC2-selective as the 31-mer peptide R3P12 or R3P3. Interestingly, R3P36 displayed the greatest VPAC2 selectivity (150-fold) in the binding assay, and was an even better VPAC2 selective agonist than the VIP analog Ro 25-1553 (60-fold). These results suggest that increasing the number of positive charges at the C terminus greatly reduced VPAC1 activity without affecting VPAC2 activity. Peptides R3P53 to R3P59 and R3P65 were designed to reduce the number of mutations found in R3P36, the lead peptide from Round 4, based on the knowledge that the lead peptide R3P51 from Round 3 did not require Leu-17 and Asp-25 mutations found on R3P36 to achieve full VPAC2 selectivity. All of these new peptides are selective for VPAC2 with the five-mutation R3P53 and R3P55 being the most selective agonists. R3P55 contains only two (Ala-19 and Lys-27) of the original 11 mutations found in Ro 25-1553, yet it was more selective in the binding assay (180-fold versus 60-fold, respectively). Sequence comparison of R3P53 and R3P55 suggested that the Lys-28 and Tyr-31 mutations may not be crucial for the dramatic selectivity displayed since neither mutation was found in both peptides (see Table I). The four common mutations Ala-19, Lys-27, Lys-29, and Arg-30 were introduced into VIP to generate R3P65, which exhibited similar VPAC2 selectivity and potency as R3P53 and R3P55. Further reductions in the number of mutations did not result in peptides with comparable selectivity (data not shown), suggesting that all four mutations were needed to ensure maximum selectivity. Thus, we have created a highly VPAC2 selective and potent peptide that differs from VIP by only four amino acids (see Fig.4). To understand which amino acids maximally favor VPAC2 selectivity at each of the four critical VPAC2 selective positions 19, 27, 29, and 30, saturation mutagenesis at each position was performed using peptide R3P65 as a template followed by recombining the most selective mutations. This data showed that position 19 was most sensitive to substitutions in the cAMP assay (see TableIII). Large, bulky, and hydrophobic amino acids at position 19 in general resulted in a loss of selectivity. In contrast, most amino acids were well tolerated for VPAC2 selectivity at position 27, with proline, arginine, and glutamine being somewhat more selective than other amino acids. All amino acids were generally well tolerated for VPAC2 selectivity at positions 29 and 30. The most selective amino acids at positions 19 (Ala, Gly, Lys, Arg, and Ser) and 27 (Lys, Pro, Gln, and Arg) were recombined while fixing position 29 with arginine and 30 with isoleucine (see TableIV). Most of the resulting 20 mutant peptides were all highly selective for VPAC2.Table IIISaturation mutagenesis of R3P65 to identify amino acids that will maintain VPAC2 selectivity at positions 19, 27, 29, and 30Amino AcidsPosition 19Position 27Position 29Position 30VPAC2 EC50VPAC1EC50RatioVPAC2 EC50VPAC1EC50RatioVPAC2 EC50VPAC1EC50RatioVPAC2EC50VPAC1 EC50RatioA120200.4401000.240200D1000100010.5115300.320700.440100E140400.4715300.3301001100100F0.310300.21050NENE0.350170G1400400150500.3720500.07690H6030050.210500.3515500.5200400I0.050.480.15500.2201000.2100500K0.21005000.260300L0.3130.24400.26300.1120200M0.12200.193150.166300.1840200N200100052603033001000.3100300P3001000312002000.46501000.5150300Q1010001000.53006000.29301000.150500R0.51002000.3602000.2100500S31000300150500.32301001300300T0.1440140400.4640800.1760300V0.33100.320700.840500.260300W220100.21050NENE0.120200Y6300500.09880NENE0.480200EC50 is defined as the concentration of the peptide at which 50% of maximum PACAP27 cAMP accumulation in CHO cells transfected with the appropriate receptor is reached.

Cysteine mutant peptides at all four positions also could not be expressed. None of these VIP-based peptides displayed any PAC1 binding or cAMP accumulation. To understand the structure-activity relationship of PACAP binding to its three receptors and identify novel VPAC2 selective mutations, we performed scanning mutagenesis of PACAP27. Because creating a more positively charged environment near the C terminus of VIP resulted in greater VPAC2 selectivity, we chose to substitute each neutral or acidic residue in PACAP27 with the basic amino acid lysine. Positions already represented by basic residues in the native PACAP27 were replaced with the acidic amino acid glutamic acid (see Table II). Adding a charge or reversing the charge at a position would have a more dramatic effect on activity than the traditional alanine-scanning mutagenesis and thus would more likely result in receptor selective agonists. As expected, these mutations were not well tolerated at most positions in PACAP27 with the exception of the C-terminal portion. Also, consistent with their ligand selectivity, the pattern of mutational effect was more conserved between VPAC2 and VPAC1 than PAC1 (Fig.5). Charge changes at positions 1, 5, 12, and 16 affected PAC1 binding much more than VPAC1 and VPAC2. PAC13 and PAC22 displayed VPAC1 selectivity as the lysine mutations at these positions reduced VPAC2 and PAC1 binding much more than VPAC1. Lysine mutations at residues 9, 11, and 18 were much more disruptive to VPAC2 binding. Charge reversal at positions 12 and 15 of PACAP27 induced significant VPAC2 selectivity over VPAC1, but did not"

Plant Cell Environ. 1999; 22: 433-445Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Plant CS-lyases are involved in a range of processes, including the synthesis and degradation of natural products, amino acid metabolism, and generation of precursors for the synthesis of ethylene, polyamines, and particular proteins (2Kiddle G.A. Bennett R.N. Hick A.J. Wallsgrove R.M. Plant Cell Environ. 1999; 22: 433-445Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although several plant pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)1-dependent CS-lyases have been characterized comprehensively (3Breitinger U. Clausen T. Ehlert S. Huber R. Laber B. Schmidt F. Pohl E.

Whitaker J.R. J. Food Biochem. 1998; 22: 427-440Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cystine lyases have previously been purified from broccoli and characterized with regard to substrate specificities and kinetics in the presence or absence of inhibitors (1Ramirez E.C. Whitaker J.R.

However, there are no reports available that describe the identification of a plant cystine lyase at the molecular level. Plant cystine lyases generally catalyze the cleavage of the β-carbon-sulfide link of l-cystine, resulting in the liberation of thiocysteine, pyruvate, and ammonia (Fig.1) (1Ramirez E.C. Whitaker J.R. J. Food Biochem. 1998; 22: 427-440Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thiocysteine can then be further metabolizesd into thiocystine, thiocyanate, hydrogen sulfide, iron-sulfur clusters for protein assembly, or elemental sulfur (6Iciek M. Wlodek L. Pol. J. Pharmacol. Pharm. 2001; 53: 215-225Google Scholar). Aminotransferases (EC 2.6.1.-) are similar to most CS-lyases in that they utilize PLP as a co-factor and that they are involved in amino acid metabolism (7Mehta P.K. Christen P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 74: 129-184Google Scholar). They may also be related phylogenetically (7Mehta P.K. Christen P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

The initial bacterial lysis buffer contained 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 200 mmNaCl, 6 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma). Histidine tag purification was employed for recombinant protein expressed using the pETBLUE2 vector and EDTA, and DTT was omitted from the lysis buffer used in this case. Aliquots of total soluble protein was stored at −80 °C. Soluble yeast protein was extracted using acid-washed glass beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) using breaking buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 3 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA) and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant protein modified with a histidine tag was purified using chelating Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins expressed using the pGEX-6p2 vector were purified using the MicroSpin glutathione S-transferase purification module (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified recombinant protein was stored at −80 °C with or without the addition of glycerol up to a final concentration of 5%. Crude and purified proteins obtained from hosts harboring empty vectors were prepared in the same way as each respective construct and employed as negative controls for enzyme assays. All assays were conducted using crude or purified soluble protein obtained from plant extracts or cultures expressing vectors with inserts or without (negative control) as described above. Cystine lyase activity was measured by two different methods. Method 1 essentially followed that described in (23Anderson N.W. Thompson J.F. Phytochemistry. 1979; 18: 1953-1958Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼0.1–1 μg of recombinant CORI3, or 10–25 μg of crude protein, was added to 200 μl of reaction mixture (50 μm PLP, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 0.5–8 mml-cystine (solubilized as described in Ref. 23Anderson N.W. Thompson J.F. Phytochemistry. 1979; 18: 1953-1958Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and 0–4 mml-tyrosine) and allowed to incubate at 30 °C for 10 min. 200 μl of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (0.1% w/v) was added to each reaction, mixed gently, and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 5 min. 1 ml of 2 n NaOH was then added, mixed, and incubated as above. The final mixture was diluted 1 in 4 using H2O and the absorbance at 520 nm measured using a U-2001 spectrophotometer (Hitachi). Method 2 was based on detecting the end product pyruvate (Fig. 1) by capillary electrophoresis using an Agilent Technologies HP3D system (fused silica capillary, 112.5 cm × 50 μm). Assay samples prepared as above were filtered through an Amicon Ultrafree-MC 5000 nominal molecular weight filter after incubation and stored at −70 °C prior to analysis. Electrophoresis was conducted using the basic anion buffer (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Method 1 was employed for kinetic data, and assays were conducted in triplicate as described in the figure legend to Fig. 4. Tyrosine aminotransferase assays were also measured by two different methods. Method 1 followed that described in Refs. 12Lopukhina A. Dettenberg M. Weiler E.W. Holländer-Czytko H.

Briefly, ∼0.1–1 μg of recombinant CORI3, or 10–25 μg of crude protein, was added to 200 μl of reaction mixture (50 μm PLP, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6), 1–8 mml-tyrosine) and allowed to incubate at 30 °C for 10–30 min. 66 μl of 2 n NaOH was then added and the entire reaction mixture mixed followed by a measurement of the absorbance at 331 nm as above with or without a 4-fold dilution using H2O. All aminotransferase reactions will in theory generatel-glutamate from 2-oxoglutarate (Fig. 1). Method 2 was therefore based on detecting the end product l-glutamate using capillary electrophoresis as described above and employed as a qualitative assay for tyrosine, aspartate, alanine, and tryptophan aminotransferase activities. Anion-exchange HPLC was also used in the detection of l-glutamate for increased sensitivity. An Hitachi L-7000 series HPLC with fluorescent detector (excitation 340 nm, emission 450 nm) and ion-exchange resin (2619F, 4 × 150 mm, Hitachi) was employed. The following elution profile was employed using elution buffer A (0.024 m trilithium citrate, 0.035m lithium chloride, 0.013 m citrate, 2.8% ethanol (pH 2.77 adjusted with citrate), elution buffer B (0.024m trilithium citrate, 0.035 m lithium chloride), elution buffer C (0.2 m lithium hydroxide, 4% ethanol), and reaction buffer (0.4 m borate, 0.4m potassium hydrate, 0.22% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.012m o-phthalaldehyde): 0 min, 100% buffer A; 16 min, 100% buffer A, 41 min, 90% buffer A, 10% buffer B; 50 min, 90% buffer A, 10% buffer B; 100 min, 100% buffer B; 125 min, 100% buffer B; 125.1 min, 100% buffer C; 140 min, 100% buffer C; 140.1 min, 100% buffer A; 155 min, 100% buffer A) with linear gradients in between the time points. The elution buffer flow rate was 0.4 ml/min, while the reaction buffer flow rate was 0.6 ml/min. All assays were calibrated using commercial standards of pyruvate andl-glutamate, respectively. Kinetic assay velocities, determined using crude preparations containing recombinant CORI3, were calculated using an estimate of the equivalent concentration of recombinant CORI3 in crude preparations, based on the amount of CORI3 that was recovered after purification. A cystine-lyase activity was isolated from broccoli using a combination of previously established procedures (16Ukai K. Sekiya J. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 1890-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and additional Cibacron blue affinity chromatography. Two polypeptides migrating around 43 kDa by SDS-PAGE correlated with cystine lyase activity after elution from the Cibacron blue 3GA column with a linear salt gradient (data not shown). The active fractions were subjected to preparative native PAGE, and in-gel cystine lyase activity staining confirmed that the major polypeptide(s), as visualized by Coomassie staining, co-migrated with cystine lyase activity staining (Fig.2 A). The approximate region displaying cystine lyase activity staining was eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 B), which revealed two major closely migrating bands. Both 43-kDa polypeptides were subjected to in-gel digestion, and peptide mapping by HPLC revealed more than 20 peaks exhibiting similar retention times in both polypeptide digests. Only two peaks, in the HPLC chromatogram of the two digests, displayed a different elution pattern. This supports that the two 43-kDa polypeptides are two closely related isoforms, as suggested previously (5Ukai K. Sekiya J. Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 853-859Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Hamamoto A. Mazelis M. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 702-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two peaks that appeared in the chromatograms of both digests (fraction 63 and 75, Fig. 3) were subjected to amino acid sequencing.Figure 3Multiple sequence alignment with the deduced amino acid sequences of CORI3 BOCL3 and one of the rooty/superroot1-encoding alleles (accession numberAF301900-1).

Approximately 280,000 plaques of an unamplified broccoli inflorescence cDNA phage library were screened using radioactively labeled BOCL-175. One positive full-length clone, BOCL-3, with a 1284-base pair open reading frame was isolated (GenBankTM accession number AY187682). The deduced translation product comprises 423 amino acids and has a predicted molecular mass of 47.2 kDa and a theoretical pI of 8.3 (Fig. 3). The two amino acid sequences obtained from peptide mapping were both contained within the deduced amino acid sequence ofBOCL-3 with the exception of Trp252, which was predicted to be a Tyr residue, and the two peptide sequences areunderlined in Fig. 3.

The strong inducibility of the CORI3 transcript in response to high salt conditions (11Gong Z. Koiwa H. Cushman M.A. Ray A. Bufford D. Kore-eda S. Matsumoto T.K. Zhu J. Cushman J.C. Bressan R.A. Hasegawa P.M.

A full-length expressed sequence tag of CORI3 (AV442456) was therefore obtained and sequenced in both directions to verify the content. A range of bacterial and yeast expression vectors, empty or containingBOCL3 and CORI3, were prepared to examine thein vitro activity of the recombinant protein products. Recombinant CORI3 was synthesized in E. coli and purified using His tag purification (Fig. 4,lanes 1–4). Likewise, expression of recombinantBOCL3 was attempted using three different bacterial expression vectors and one yeast expression vector. Crude E. coli extracts containing recombinant CORI3 showed evidence of both cystine lyase and tyrosine aminotransferase activity (Fig. 4, lane 2) when assayed using two different assay methods (assay methods 1 and 2 described under “Experimental Procedures”). However, purified recombinant CORI3 only displayed cystine lyase activity (Fig. 4, lane 3), while crude protein extracted from E. coli harboring empty pETBLUE2 only catalyzed a tyrosine aminotransferase reaction (Fig. 4, lane 1), and after purification displayed neither cystine lyase nor aminotransferase activities (Fig. 4, lane 4). Crude protein extracted from E. coli harboring all three tested expression vectors fused with BOCL3, and yeast harboring pYES2-BOCL3 showed no sign of cystine lyase activity and no more tyrosine aminotransferase activity than that displayed by protein prepared from the respective microorganisms harboring empty vectors. Kinetic analyses of recombinant CORI3 was next pursued with the aim of uncovering the possible role of CORI3 in its native environment. Replicate assays were conducted at varying concentrations of l-cystine in the presence or absence of l-tyrosine. A plot of activityversus substrate concentration at different concentrations of l-tyrosine revealed little difference in the cystine lyase activity of CORI3 in the presence or absence ofl-tyrosine at similar levels of concentration, except for 4 mml-cystine and 4 mml-tyrosine (Fig. 5). A theoreticalV max of 3571 nanokatals × mg−1 CORI3, and a theoretical K mvalue of 2.32 mml-cystine was calculated from the Lineweaver-Burk plot (data not shown). The specific cystine lyase activity of crude E. coli protein preparations containing recombinant CORI3 (Fig. 4, lane 2) and purified recombinant CORI3 (Fig. 4, lane 3) was 42 nanokatals × mg−1 total protein (2142 nanokatals × mg−1, CORI3 equivalent (see “Experimental Procedures”)) and 1306 nanokatals × mg−1 CORI3, respectively, using 4 mml-cystine as substrate. This should be compared with the maximum specific activity previously reported with tyrosine aminotransferase activity assays for recombinant CORI3; 55.2 nanokatals × mg−1 CORI3 (12Lopukhina A. Dettenberg M. Weiler E.W. Holländer-Czytko H. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1678-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Alanine and aspartate aminotransferase activity assays were also conducted, since porcine heart aspartate and alanine aminotransferases with cystine-conjugate cleaving capability had been reported previously (9Adcock H.J. Gaskin P.J. Shaw P.N. Teesdale-Spittle P.H. Buckberry L.D. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1996; 48: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Likewise, due to the high positional amino acid identity in the deduced amino acid sequences of CORI3 androoty/superroot1 (42.8–45.0%), a possible involvement of CORI3 in tryptophan metabolism (29Celenza J.L. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 234-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was also investigated by assaying for tryptophan aminotransferase activity. All aminotransferase activity assays were conducted by monitoring forl-glutamate production (assay method 2 described under “Experimental Procedures”). However, no aminotransferase activity could be detected with any of the potential substrates. The present paper presents several lines of evidence which suggest that CORI3 more properly should be regarded as a cystine lyase rather than as a tyrosine aminotransferase, although it cannot be excluded that it may also catalyze other until now untested reactions. (a) We were not able to detect any tyrosine aminotransferase activity with purified recombinant CORI3 preparations using two different methods of enzyme analysis, despite earlier contrary reports (12Lopukhina A. Dettenberg M. Weiler E.W. Holländer-Czytko H. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1678-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). E. coli, however, is capable of such activity, and residual native tyrosine aminotransferase-catalyzing proteins present in the purified preparations employed by Loupokhina et al. (12Lopukhina A. Dettenberg M. Weiler E.W. Holländer-Czytko H. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1678-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) may explain why such an activity could be detected, although the same method of purification as that reported herewith was employed. (b) The specific cystine lyase activity of purified recombinant CORI3 was more than 20 times higher than that previously reported for the specific tyrosine aminotransferase activity (12Lopukhina A. Dettenberg M. Weiler E.W. Holländer-Czytko H. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1678-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). (c) Only a slight inhibition of cystine lyase activity could be detected at the highest concentration of bothl-tyrosine (4 mm) and l-cystine (4 mm) (Fig. 5). These concentrations are unrealistically high compared with physiological levels (30Urano Y. Manabe T. Noji M. Saito K. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 257: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and at lower levels there was no inhibition. For example, 2 mml-cystine and 4 mml-tyrosine produced equal amounts of pyruvate compared with assays excluding l-tyrosine (Fig.5). The purification of a plant cystine lyase is not novel (1Ramirez E.C. Whitaker J.R. J. Food Biochem. 1998; 22: 427-440Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 16Ukai K. Sekiya J. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 1890-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 25Hamamoto A. Mazelis M. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 702-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the identification of a plant-derived nucleic acid sequence that encodes a cystine lyase, CORI3, certainly is. The isolation of BOCL3 and its corresponding cDNA clone by classical biochemical methods proved essential for the identification of the true function of the protein encoded by CORI3. The annotation ofCORI3 as a tyrosine aminotransferase-encoding cDNA was originally based on similarity to mammalian aminotransferases and not on the isolation of such a protein, although apparently confirmed, subsequently, by analyzing the aminotransferase activity of recombinant CORI3 (12Lopukhina A. Dettenberg M. Weiler E.W. Holländer-Czytko H. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1678-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a high amino acid sequence similarity between plant cystine lyases and aminotransferases is not surprising given that both enzyme classes are PLP-dependent and involved in amino acid metabolism and that aminotransferases with cystine lyase activity have been reported previously (9Adcock H.J. Gaskin P.J. Shaw P.N. Teesdale-Spittle P.H. Buckberry L.D. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1996; 48: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Further BLAST searches that only considered functionally characterized genes indicated that BOCL3 and CORI3 display highest amino acid sequence identity to the deduced amino acid sequence of two Hordeum vulgare nicotianamine aminotransferase encoding cDNAs (42% positional amino acid identity (31Takahashi M. Yamaguchi H. Nakanishi H. Shioiri T. Nishizawa N.-K. Mori S. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 947-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar)) and several rat tyrosine aminotransferase encoding cDNAs. The present result suggests that also plant cystine lyases may be phylogenetically related with aminotransferases as suggested previously for other CS-lyase family members (7Mehta P.K. Christen P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1998; 74: 129-184Google Scholar). Confirmation of the in vitro activity of recombinant BOCL3 remains elusive, however, and even surprising given the high positional amino acid identity between BOCL3 and CORI3 and the fact that the same expression method that was used successfully for CORI3 also was tried for BOCL3 expression. The absence of native glycosylation when BOCL3 is expressed in heterologous hosts such as E. coli and S. cerevisciae may also play a role in impairing activity directly or by hindering proper folding of BOCL3 into a functionally active state. Expression of BOCL3in A. thaliana may therefore provide a successful alternative, and such trials are currently in progress. The redefinition of the probable catalytic function of CORI3, as the first identified plant cystine lyase, calls for a reassessment of the probable catalytic function of the proteins encoded by the other seven members of the group of highly homologous A. thaliana genes annotated as putative tyrosine aminotransferases (Table I). Therooty/superroot1 gene is the only other investigated member of this group apart from CORI3. A. thaliana mutants with mutations in alleles of this gene locus were isolated based on an altered phenotype, and further analysis showed that these mutants contained elevated levels of indole acetic acid (32Boerjan W. Cervera M.-T. Delarue M. Beeckman T. Dewitte W. Bellini C. Caboche M. Van Onckelen H. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1405-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar,33King J.J. Stimart D.P. Fisher R.H. Bleecker A.B. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2023-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The putative gene sequence of several alleles of the locus in question was obtained (13.Gopalraj, M., Kelman, L., Tsen, T.-S., Olszewski, N. E. (1997)The Eighth International Meeting on Arabidopsis Research, June 25–29, 1997, Madison, WI(abstract available at www.arabidopsis.org/madison97/at97abs/imar_7-40.html).Google Scholar), but the catalytic function of the protein encoded by rooty/superroot1 (rooty/superroot1) remains unknown despite a multitude of approaches (13.Gopalraj, M., Kelman, L., Tsen, T.-S., Olszewski, N. E. (1997)The Eighth International Meeting on Arabidopsis Research, June 25–29, 1997, Madison, WI(abstract available at www.arabidopsis.org/madison97/at97abs/imar_7-40.html).Google Scholar, 14Seo M. Akaba S. Oritani T. Delarue M. Bellini C. Caboche M. Koshiba T. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). If rooty/superroot1 acts as a CS-lyase in planta, as suggested by the sequence similarity of rooty/superroot1 and CORI3, one possible role could be as the proposed CS-lyase that catalyzes the desulfhydration of S-alkyl thiohydroximate to afford thiohydroximate in the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway (2Kiddle G.A. Bennett R.N. Hick A.J. Wallsgrove R.M. Plant Cell Environ. 1999; 22: 433-445Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar,35Hansen C.H. Du L. Naur P. Olsen C.E. Axelsen K.B. Hick A.J. Pickett J.A. Halkier B.A. J. Biol.

Tax F.R. Feldmann K.A. Galbraith D.W. Feyreisen R. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Alternative functional roles for CORI3 and cystine lyases also need to be considered. Cystine lyases may be involved in sulfur metabolism, for example, by maintaining thiocysteine availability for cyanide degradation by rhodanese (36Hatzfeld Y. Saito K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Papenbrock J. Schmidt A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or for reduced sulfur compound generation. It has also been suggested that plant cystine lyases may be identical with cystathionine lyases (23Anderson N.W. Thompson J.F. Phytochemistry. 1979; 18: 1953-1958Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 38Hall D.I. Smith I.K. Plant Physiol. 1983; 72: 654-658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but such a concept has later been found to be improper after analysis of highly purified cystine lyase protein preparations (16Ukai K. Sekiya J. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1997; 61: 1890-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It is still possible, nevertheless, that cystine lyases such as CORI3 can complement cystathionine lyases in planta with regards to thiocysteine production. The identification of a new plant CS-lyase member, the first plant cystine lyase identified at a molecular level, adds impetus to a number of potential investigations such as the possible involvement of CS-lyases in glucosinolate biosynthesis (2Kiddle G.A. Bennett R.N. Hick A.J. Wallsgrove R.M. Plant Cell Environ. 1999; 22: 433-445Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 35Hansen C.H. Du L. Naur P. Olsen C.E. Axelsen K.B. Hick A.J. Pickett J.A.

The inducible nature ofCORI3 also makes it highly desirable to find out more about the biological role of cystine lyases in plants and CORI3 in particular. Further in depth investigations into the metabolic role of cystine lyases and l-cystine are now also opened. To achieve an insight into the true role of CORI3 in planta, our primary strategy is to create transgenic Arabidopsiswith up-regulated and down-regulated expression ofCORI3."
https://openalex.org/W1969172517,"The nuclear import of 5-lipoxygenase modulates its capacity to produce leukotrienes from arachidonic acid. However, the molecular determinants of its nuclear import are unknown. Recently, we used structural and functional criteria to identify a novel import sequence at Arg518 on human 5-lipoxygenase (Jones, S. M., Luo, M., Healy, A. M., Peters-Golden, M., and Brock, T. G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 38550–38556). However, this analysis also indicated that other import sequences must exist. Here, we identify two additional sites, at Arg112 and Lys158, as nuclear import sequences. Both sites were found to be common to 5-lipoxygenases from different species but not found on other lipoxygenases. Both sites also appeared to be a part of structures that were predominantly random loops. Peptide sequences at these sites were sufficient to direct nuclear import of green fluorescent protein. Mutation of basic residues in these sites impaired nuclear import and combinations of mutations at different sites were additive in effect. Mutations in all three sites were required to disable nuclear accumulation of 5-lipoxygenase in all cells. Significantly, mutation in these sites did not inhibit catalytic function. Taken together, these results indicate that nuclear import of 5-lipoxygenase may reflect the combined functional effects of three discrete import sequences. Mutation of individual sites can, by itself, impair nuclear import, which in turn could impact arachidonic acid metabolism.

Here, we identify two additional sites, at Arg112 and Lys158, as nuclear import sequences. Both sites were found to be common to 5-lipoxygenases from different species but not found on other lipoxygenases. Both sites also appeared to be a part of structures that were predominantly random loops. Peptide sequences at these sites were sufficient to direct nuclear import of green fluorescent protein. Mutation of basic residues in these sites impaired nuclear import and combinations of mutations at different sites were additive in effect. Mutations in all three sites were required to disable nuclear accumulation of 5-lipoxygenase in all cells. Significantly, mutation in these sites did not inhibit catalytic function. Taken together, these results indicate that nuclear import of 5-lipoxygenase may reflect the combined functional effects of three discrete import sequences. Mutation of individual sites can, by itself, impair nuclear import, which in turn could impact arachidonic acid metabolism. leukotriene lipoxygenase nuclear import sequence basic region green fluorescent protein enhanced green fluorescent protein wild type mutant protein data bank Leukotrienes (LTs)1 are lipid mediators derived from arachidonic acid.

Therefore, the regulation of 5-LO action and how it might be modulated in disease have been a focus of interest. The cellular locale of 5-LO differs in different cell types. 5-LO is localized in the cytoplasm of peripheral blood neutrophils (2Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol.

Subsequent observations have further indicated that nuclear import of 5-LO is a regulated process. Nuclear import can be triggered by adherence (2Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M.

Thus, the nuclear import of the 5-LO enzyme is linked to its ability to synthesize LTs. The molecular components that regulate nuclear import of 5-LO remain to be fully elucidated. Commonly, a nuclear import sequence (NIS), rich in the basic amino acids Arg and Lys, mediates nuclear import of proteins, and three such basic regions (BR) have been identified (13Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Truncation of 5-LO suggested the presence of an NIS in the amino-terminal region of 5-LO (13Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, limited mutagenesis of a BR at Lys72did not prevent nuclear import, suggesting that a non-conventional NIS may exist in the amino terminus of 5-LO. Another site, at Arg651, resembles a bipartite NIS. Mutational analysis of this region demonstrated that most basic residues could be replaced without affecting nuclear import (13Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Yao J.P. Brock T.G. J. Biol.

J. 2002; 361: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), unless Arg651was replaced (14Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Yao J.P. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29812-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Hanaka H. Shimizu T. Izumi T. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, replacement of Arg651 also caused loss of catalytic activity (15Hanaka H. Shimizu T. Izumi T. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that mutagenesis caused protein misfolding, which can also impair import (13Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, analysis of 5-LO secondary structure indicated that Arg651 serves a critical structural role, through its association with Asp473 (16Jones S.M. Luo M. Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38550-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, we developed novel structural and functional criteria to identify functional NIS on 5-LO (16Jones S.M. Luo M. Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38550-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). First, we sought basic residues that were common to 5-LO from different species but not shared by other LO, since nuclear import has been observed in 5-LO from all species but not in 15-LO and 12-LO. Second, we sought BRs having a predominantly random coil/loop secondary structure, which appears to be necessary for binding to importin-α proteins (17Fontes M.R. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 18Conti E. Kuriyan J. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 329-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 19Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Finally, mutations that altered nuclear import should not also inactivate the enzyme, since failed import may result from mutation-induced changes in protein structure (13Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); loss of activity, then, would be used as an indirect indication of such a false positive result. Application of these rigorous criteria to 5-LO revealed a novel site at Arg518, designated as BR518 (16Jones S.M. Luo M. Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38550-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This BR alone was sufficient to drive nuclear import, and replacement of basic residues impaired import without inactivating the enzyme, indicating that BR518 is a functional NIS. Interestingly, however, mutations in BR518could not totally abolish nuclear import in all cells, suggesting that additional NIS(s) must exist on 5-LO. This study applies the same structural and functional criteria to search for the unidentified NIS(s) on 5-LO. Our results support the conclusion that BR68, the only basic region in the β-barrel region of 5-LO, is unlikely to be a functional NIS. However, a novel site at Arg112, which links the β-barrel region to the catalytic domain, meets these criteria and appears to act as an NIS. However, mutation of basic residues in both BR518 and BR112 did not eliminate nuclear import of 5-LO. A third site at Lys158, which also meets structural and functional criteria, was found to be, by itself, sufficient for nuclear import. Mutation of all three sites eliminated nuclear accumulation of 5-LO without loss of function, indicating that 5-LO contains three functional NISs. Amino acid sequences were obtained from Swiss-Prot from the ExPaSy (Expert Protein Analysis System) proteomics server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Primary accession numbers for proteins are: 5-LOs, human P09917, mouseP48999, rat P12527, hamster P51399; 15-LOs, rabbit P12630, and humanP16050; human platelet-type 12-LO P18054; Clostridium perfringens α-toxin P15310. Alignment of protein sequences was performed using ClustalW (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). Structural analysis utilized the resolved structures of rabbit 15-LO (PDB: 1lox) and C. perfringens α-toxin (PDB: 1qmd), as well as published theoretical models of the 5-LO β-barrel region (21Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and the 5-LO catalytic region (22Hemak J. Gale D. Brock T.G. J. Mol. Model. 2002; 8: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To construct a fusion peptide joining BR112 or BR158 to green fluorescent protein (GFP), complementary oligonucleotides encoding the basic regions (indicated below) were annealed and ligated to theBamHI and HindIII sites of pEGFP-C1. BR112 peptide was Leu111–Asp121(LRDGRAKLARD); BR158 peptide was Asp156–Asp166 (DAKCHKDLPRD). Specific amino acids within the putative 5-LO NISs were substituted in the pEGFP-C1/5-LO template (14Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Yao J.P. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29812-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, two complementary primers (125 ng each) containing the desired mutation and 20 ng of template in 1× reaction buffer were denatured at 95 °C for 30 s and annealed at 55 °C for 30s, and DNA synthesis was carried out byPfu polymerase at 68 °C for 14 min. This cycle was repeated 12–18 times, depending on the number of bases substituted, according to the manufacturer's directions. The methylated template was removed by incubation with 10 units of DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h. The mutation BR518 was R518Q/R520Q/K521Q/K527Q/K530Q; mutation BR112 was R115Q/K117Q/R120Q; mutation BR158 was K158N/H160Q/K161N. All substitutions and constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis (DNA Sequencing Core, University of Michigan). Oligonucleotides (sequences available upon request) were synthesized and PAGE-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA). NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using Polyfect (Qiagen, Inc.) transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's specifications. Transient transfectants were evaluated microscopically, live, or after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, 16–20 h after transfection. Comparable results were obtained when cells were examined as early as 9 h after transfection. As described previously (14Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Yao J.P. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29812-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), cells were disrupted by sonication on ice, and protein concentrations were determined by a modified Coomassie Blue dye binding assay (Pierce). Samples containing 10 μg of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against purified human leukocyte 5-LO (a generous gift from Dr. J. Evans, Merck Research Laboratories, Rahway, NJ) (23Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Charleson S. Heibein J.A. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) or with rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; titer 1:500) followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). To stimulate 5-LO activity, cells transfected with various 5-LO constructs were washed, then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing 10 μm calcium ionophore A23187 and 10 μm arachidonic acid. Immunoreactive LTB4 in conditioned media was quantitated by enzyme immunoassay (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the supplier's instructions. For each sample, the measured value was taken as the average of duplicate determinations. Media from non-transfected, mock-transfected, or GFP-transfected cells did not contain detectable LTB4. LTB4 determinations were standardized for transfection efficiency: cells were washed following stimulation, harvested by scraping, sonicated on ice, assayed by immunoblot analysis (using 10 μg of protein/sample) for expression using anti-GFP, with expression quantitated by densitometry. LTB4 synthesis, adjusted for construct expression, was evaluated for all constructs in at least two independent experiments. The detection limit for LTB4 was 4 pg/ml; cross-reactivity for AA, 5-HETE, LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4 was <0.01%. Alternatively, activity of constructs was evaluated by cell-free assay: 5 × 106 COS-1 cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA using Polyfect; 40-h post-transfection, cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline once, and sonicated for 90 s in 10-s bursts on ice in cell lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM EDTA-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After sonication, lysates were centrifuged (5000 rpm, 8 min, 4 °C) to remove cell debris and protein expression for each construct was confirmed first by Western blot using anti-GFP. The 5-LO activity of cell lysates (200 μg of total protein) was determined in 0.25 ml reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.6 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm ATP, 12 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), 20 μm AA (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), including ∼100,000 dpm [3H]AA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 10 μm13(S)-hydroperoxy-9-cis-11-trans-octadecadienoic acid (Cayman Chemicals). After a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of ether/methanol/1m citric acid (30:4:1, v/v/v). After vortexing thoroughly, the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The upper phase was removed, evaporated under nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Lipid residues were dissolved in 250 μl of 50% acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid (1000:1, v/v) and 50% water/trifluoroacetic acid (1000:1, v/v), analyzed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a 5-μm Bondapak C18 column (30 × 0.4 cm; Waters Associates, Milford, MA) using a mobile phase of acetonitrile/trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. 5-LO metabolites were eluted during a series of linear gradient increases of acetonitrile from initial conditions of 50:50 (v/v) to 73:27 (v/v) at 7 min, then to 85:15 (v/v) at 9 min, and finally to 100:0 (v/v) at 15 min. Radioactivity in 1-ml eluted fractions was quantitated by on-line radiodetection. There were no LTB4/LTB4 isomers detected in cell lysates; 5-HPETE and 5-HETE co-eluted as a single peak, clearly separated from un-metabolized AA. The 5-LO specific activity of different mutants was calculated and compared based on the ratio of conversion of radiolabeled AA to 5-HPETE/5-HETE. As an initial approach to quantitation, slides were fixed 16 h after transfection, and 100 positive cells were scored as to whether nuclear fluorescence was greater than, equal to or less than cytosolic fluorescence. Care was taken to avoid damaged, dead or autofluorescent cells. Results from at least three independent transfections per construct were used for statistical analysis. As a second approach, 100 individual cells per construct were scored for cytosolic and nuclear fluorescence intensity: using Adobe Photoshop 5.5, grayscale digital images were adjusted to include the full black-to-white range, and representative gray values, from 0 (white) to 100 (black), were obtained for the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. Cytoplasmic and nuclear values for each cell were summed to give total cellular fluorescence, and the percent fluorescence values for the nuclear compartment were calculated. Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance, using p < 0.05 as indicative of statistical significance. Pairs of group means were analyzed using the Tukey-Kramer post-test. As outlined above, cells expressing GFP·5-LO with mutated BR518 displayed either no import or significant import, indicating the existence of at least one other functional NIS on 5-LO. Since the BR518 NIS was identified using structural criteria noted above, these criteria were applied to other candidate sites. Previous work indicated that an NIS in the amino-terminal region of 5-LO, potentially at BR68, might function as an NIS (13Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This site was a good candidate because its primary structure, RXXKRK, fulfills the criteria of a monopartite NIS, being a cluster of 4 of 6 basic residues. Using the structural and functional criteria, BR68 was evaluated further. Comparison with the primary sequences of other lipoxygenases, however, indicated that this BR was not unique to 5LO (Fig.1 A). Thus, if it were a functional NIS on 5-LO, it might also be expected to direct the import of 15-LO and, perhaps, 12-LO. Regarding the secondary structure of BR68, no resolved structure for 5-LO is available. However, predicted structures for the β-barrel domain have been published using C. perfringens α-toxin (21Kulkarni S. Das S. Funk C.D. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13167-13174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) or 15-LO (24Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) as templates, and the structure of the 15-LO β-barrel domain has been published (25Gillmor S. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The majority of the amino acids in BR68were found to be involved in the fifth β-sheet, in the predicted structure of 5-LO patterned after α-toxin (Fig. 1 B) and in the resolved structure of 15-LO (Fig. 1 C), as well as in the 5-LO structure patterned after 15-LO (Ref. 24Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar and not shown here). This suggests that this region serves a critical structural role in the amino-terminal β-barrel and is not available for binding importin. These results indicate that BR68 is unlikely to be a functional NIS. Alignment of LO primary sequences revealed a novel basic region, beginning at R112 on human 5-LO, which was conserved across 5-LOs and not found in 12- or 15-LOs (Fig. 2 A). Correct alignment was suggested by high levels of amino acid similarity on both sides of the region as well as alignment of the α-helix in the catalytic domain. This region, designated BR112, contained 4 basic amino acids over a stretch of 9 residues. The region was located on a random coil between the β-barrel and catalytic domains of 5-LO (Fig. 2 B). The presence of a conserved glycine, which can serve as a “helix breaker,” also indicated that this region would retain a random coil structure. Since the region was conserved across different 5-LOs, not found on other LOs and was on a coiled structural element, it met our primary and secondary structural criteria for a good candidate NIS. To test whether BR112 was sufficient to cause nuclear import, oligonucleotides were synthesized and inserted into the GFP vector to produce GFP with the peptide LRDGRAKLARD fused to the carboxyl terminus. As has been frequently described (e.g.(13Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)), GFP alone distributed evenly between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments in transfected cells (Fig.3), because it is small enough to diffuse freely through the nuclear pore. However, the GFP·BR112fusion protein showed distinct nuclear accumulation (Fig. 3), indicating that this peptide alone is sufficient to drive nuclear import against a diffusion gradient. To determine whether BR112 was necessary for nuclear import, the effect of basic residue replacement in BR112, in the context of GFP·5-LO, was evaluated. Three residues were replaced by site-directed mutagenesis: R115Q/K117Q/R120Q. As described previously (13Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Yao J.P. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29812-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the wild type (WT) GFP·5-LO fusion protein showed strong nuclear accumulation in most cells (Fig.4, A and B). Cells expressing GFP·5-LO with mutation of BR112 included two distinct phenotypes: some cells had little or no nuclear fluorescence, while others showed clear nuclear accumulation of the expressed protein (Fig. 4, C and D). This result was first quantitated by scoring individual cells as having nuclear fluorescence greater than, equal to or less than the cytosolic fluorescence. Representative images and numbers for one experiment are given in Fig.5. While the majority (65%) of cells expressing WT GFP·5-LO had nuclear accumulation, a significant number (31%) had a balanced distribution. A balanced distribution of 5-LO, associated with nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis, has been described (7Brock T.G. Paine R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantitated (15Hanaka H. Shimizu T. Izumi T. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutation at the BR112site reduced the number of cells with nuclear import and increased those with cytosolic fluorescence. These results indicated that mutation of BR112 in the context of GFP·5-LO impaired nuclear import of the fusion protein in some 3T3 cells.Figure 5Initial evaluation of the distribution phenotypes observed with WT or mutBR112 GFP·5-LO.3T3 cells were transfected with GFP·5-LO that was unmodified (WT) or mutated at BR112. After 16 h, 100 positive cells were scored for either nuclear accumulation (Nuc > Cyto), balanced (Nuc = Cyto), or cytosolic (Nuc < Cyto) distribution and representative cells were imaged. Numbersindicate results from one experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) While the above results demonstrated that mutation of the BR112 site affected the subcellular distribution of 5-LO, they do not clearly define the nature of that effect. In particular, they did not clearly indicate whether the mutation simply reduced the efficiency of nuclear import, or whether the mutation resulted in distinct subpopulations of cells. To address this question, nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence levels in individual cells were quantitatively analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” By this analysis, there were (at least) two subpopulations exhibiting nuclear import of WT GFP·5-LO, when expressed in 3T3 cells (Fig.6 A). A major peak, consistently found in multiple transfections, consisted of cells with 60–70% of total fluorescence in the nucleus (peak N1). A shoulder, associated with 70–90% nuclear fluorescence, also was consistently observed (peak N2). Mutation of BR112, as shown in Fig. 6 B, reduced the number of strongly importing cells (peak N2) and reduced the rate of nuclear import, as indicated by the shift of peak N1 to the left (i.e. to 55%). More significantly, this mutation produced a new population with only 30–40% nuclear fluorescence, designated peak C1. It should be noted that these cells, shown in Figs. 4 and 5, had little or no nuclear import; the relatively high value of 35% nuclear fluorescence reflects the conservative scoring of this quantitative method. In general terms, these results indicated that mutation of BR112 reduced the capacity for the strong nuclear import that produced the N2 peak. The resulting protein was still capable of pronounced nuclear import in some cells, as evidenced by the persistent N1 peak. However, the resulting protein did not direct nuclear import in those cells comprising the C1 peak. The finding that mutation in BR112 produced discrete import competent and non-importing populations was very similar to results previously found with mutations in BR518 (16Jones S.M. Luo M.

IL-5, and IL-3 are three cytokines produced by activated T-cells during immune responses that are important mediators of inducible hematopoiesis and inflammation. They signal through a shared receptor (the βc receptor) and play an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic disorders and inflammatory diseases of the lung, such as asthma (1Foster P.S.

Human GM-CSF and IL-3 bind to their cognate α receptors with low affinities, but in the presence of βc, high affinity complexes are formed. For example, with GM-CSF, theK d values for low and high affinity binding are 2–10 nm and 50–100 pm, respectively. Human IL-5 differs from IL-3 and GM-CSF in that it binds to its α receptor (IL-5Rα) with greater affinity, and there is only a small affinity conversion by the βc subunit (10Takaki S. Murata Y.

The formation of a complex involving ligand and the α and βc receptors is necessary for receptor activation and signaling. The cytoplasmic portions of the α and βc subunits possess no intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (12Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3549Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) but in the activated receptor complexes formed with all three ligands interact with and activate Janus kinase 2 (13Quelle F.W.

Structurally, the α and βc subunits of the GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 receptors belong to the cytokine class I receptor superfamily (or hemopoietin receptor family), which includes the growth hormone, erythropoietin, gp130, and IL-4α receptors. The characteristic feature of this family is the extracellular cytokine receptor homology module, composed of two fibronectin III domains that contain a number of conserved sequence elements (17Bazan J.F.

The extracellular domains of these receptors contain two approximately orthogonal fibronectin III domains that each contribute key residues for ligand binding from loops at the receptor “elbow” region. To what extent these principles apply to the βc subunit has not been clear, because βc does not bind any of its three ligands directly, has four fibronectin III domains in its extracellular region rather than two, and heterodimerizes with the respective α receptors. By analogy with the other class I receptors, several groups have predicted the existence of an elbow region formed by domains 3 and 4 of βc that would serve as a ligand-binding interface. Mutagenesis studies have been successful in identifying residues in the B′-C′ (28Lock P. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our recent determination of the crystal structure of the complete extracellular domain of the human βc subunit (Fig.1) showed it to exist as a stable, intertwined homodimer (32Carr P.D. Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Woltring D.M. Walker I. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Cell. 2001; 104: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A number of lines of evidence indicate that the dimer is not confined to the crystal and is likely to be the functional form of the receptor in vivo (32Carr P.D. Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Woltring D.M. Walker I. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Cell. 2001; 104: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A highly novel feature of the structure is that strand G of domain 1 forms strand G of domain 3 of the dimer-related molecule, and likewise strand G of domain 3 partners with the dimer-related domain 1. The unique interlocking dimeric structure of βc results in the juxtapositioning of domain 1 of one chain adjacent to domain 4 of its dimer-related equivalent chain (Fig. 1). The interface between domains 1 and 4 is approximately orthogonal and resembles the ligand-binding interface of the growth hormone, erythropoietin, and IL-4α receptors (Fig. 1). Thus, by analogy with other class I cytokine receptors, domains 1 and 4 could form a ligand-binding interface involved in high affinity complex formation. However, it has not been clear to what extent the binding interactions in the βc activation complex conform to the principles for ligand binding already established in the cytokine class I receptor family or whether novel types of interactions are involved. In the present work, we have used site-directed mutagenesis, ligand binding, and proliferation assays to establish that Tyr15and Phe79 of domain 1 of βc are required for high affinity ligand binding and receptor activation. The novel ligand-receptor interface, which involves cooperation between domains 1 and 4 of two different chains of the βc receptor dimer, is the first example in the class I cytokine receptor family of a functional epitope that involves noncontiguous fibronectin III domains. A cDNA encoding the extracellular domain of the human βc subunit (residues 1–443) was cloned from HL60 eosinophils (33Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA was constructed by substituting a BstXI-BssHII fragment of the extracellular domain of the cDNA for βc isolated from TF1 cells (8Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase. The complete sequences of mutant βc cDNAs were verified by Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Gladesville, Australia). For expression in COS7 cells, the cDNAs encoding human GM-CSFRα (from T. Willson, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Melbourne, Australia) or IL-5Rα and wild type or mutant βc subunits were subcloned into pCEX-V3-Xba, a vector derived from pCEX-V3 (34Miller J. Malek T.R. Leonard W.J. Greene W.C. Shevach E.M. Germain R.N. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 4212-4217PubMed Google Scholar). For expression in CTLL-2 cells, cDNAs encoding human GM-CSFRα or IL-5Rα were subcloned into pEF-IRES-N, and the βc subunits were subcloned into pEF-IRES-P (35Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C.

Human IL-5, human GM-CSF, and murine IL-2 were produced using the baculovirus expression system (33Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Eur. J.

Blood. 1991; 78: 339-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled IL-5 was stored at 4 °C and used for up to 7 days. Radiolabeled GM-CSF was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, stored at −70 °C, and used for up to 6 weeks. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine serum and CTLL-2 cells as described previously (33Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Carr P.D.

COS7 cells were harvested using trypsin and electroporated with 10 μg of GM-CSFRα or IL-5Rα and 25 μg of wild type or mutant βc constructs at 200 V and 960 microfarads. Binding studies and antibody staining were performed on cells 64–68 h after transfection. CTLL-2 cell lines stably expressing GM-CSFRα or IL-5Rα and wild type or mutant βc subunits were generated in two steps, as described previously (33Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Ford S.C. Mann D.A.

COS7 cells expressing the relevant receptors were used to study IL-5 and GM-CSF binding and were harvested as described previously (28Lock P. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CTLL-2 cells expressing the IL-5Rα and βc subunits were cultured in IL-5 and washed four times with factor-free basal medium before use in binding assays. 106 cells in resuspended binding medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 mm HEPES and 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin) were incubated with increasing concentrations of radioligand for 2–3 h at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand to samples in which high radioligand concentrations were added. The nonspecific binding was interpolated for lower radioligand concentration data using linear regression. The assays were terminated by centrifugation of each binding solution through 0.2 ml of 2:1 v/v dibutyl phthalate:dinonyl phthalate at 12,000 × g for 4 min (37Plaetinck G. Van der Heyden J.

The tips of tubes, containing the visible cell pellet and associated radio-iodinated ligand, were counted using a Packard 5780 Auto-gamma counter. The dissociation constants (K d) and Scatchard transformations were calculated from specific binding data using the EBDA (38McPherson G.A. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1985; 14: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) and LIGAND (39Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7772) Google Scholar) programs (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Multiple data files were co-analyzed to obtain more accurate estimates of K d values. One- and two-site models were evaluated in LIGAND and only when statistically significant (p < 0.05), a two-site model was used to determineK d values. COS7 cells transfected with cDNAs encoding wild type or mutant βc subunits were incubated in the presence of rabbit antiserum raised against the βc(HL60) extracellular domain for 30min at 4 °C. The cells were washed and incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma) for 25 min at 4 °C and then washed before analysis of cell surface expression was performed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, North Ryde, Australia). [3H]Thymidine incorporation assays were performed as described previously (33Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Carr P.D. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2905-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to determine the capacity of the wild type or mutant βc subunits to deliver a proliferative signal in CTLL-2 stable cell lines. In the well established class I cytokine receptor superfamily ligand-binding motif, critical ligand-binding residues are commonly contributed from the E-F and A-B loops of the membrane-distal fibronectin III domain and from the B′-C′ and F′-G′ loops of the membrane-proximal domain (Fig.1). From the x-ray structure of βc (Fig. 1), it is clear that if ligand-binding with βc follows the previously established principles, the interface would involve residues from loops in domain 1 cooperating with those from domain 4 of the partner molecule of the βc dimer. The loops of domain 1 that could potentially be involved in ligand binding are the A-B, E-F, and C-D loops. Site-directed mutagenesis of the human βc cDNA was therefore performed to generate alanine mutants of the residues in these loops. In studies on cytokine class I receptors, alanine substitution is commonly used for the determination of residues whose side chains are involved in ligand binding. Alanine has a hydrophobic side chain but is often found in solvent-exposed regions of proteins, and its introduction does not disrupt the geometry of the main-chain, nor does the methyl side chain cause electrostatic or steric interference. Because GM-CSF has readily distinguishable low and high affinity binding, we used this ligand as a model to test the binding of the mutants. We also examined the binding of IL-5, because this cytokine, unlike GM-CSF, is an interlocking dimer and could potentially interact with βc in a different way. COS7 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding human GM-CSFRα and wild type or mutant βc subunits. Saturation binding assays were then performed on the transiently transfected COS7 cells using 125I-labeled human GM-CSF, and the dissociation constants (K d) were determined (Table I).Table IDissociation constants for GM-CSF binding to COS7 cells expressing GM-CSFRα alone and with wild type or mutant βc subunitsβcLocation of mutationNumber of sites detectedK dNumber of experimentsHigh affinity ± S.E.Low affinity ± S.E.pmnmNone1—aNo high affinity binding sites were detected.8.5 ± 0.7bThe dissociation constants ± the standard error were determined from the co-analysis of data obtained from separate binding experiments (39).2Wild type2 p < 0.00158.0 ± 24.98.3 ± 1.53Tyr15 → AlaA-B loop16.5 ± 0.64Tyr15 → PheA-B loop2 p < 0.00134.9 ± 20.67.8 ± 1.42Thr16 → AlaA-B loop2 p < 0.00134.2 ± 25.29.3 ± 2.52Ser17 → AlaA-B loop2 p < 0.00124.7 ± 21.58.9 ± 1.62His18 → AlaA-B loop2 p < 0.00169.7 ± 20.98.8 ± 1.42Cys76-Gln-Ser78 → (Ala)3E-F loop2 p < 0.00147.5 ± 30.97.0 ± 1.03Phe79 → AlaE-F loop16.3 ± 0.45Val80 → AlaE-F loop2 p = 0.001174.6 ± 146.38.0 ± 2.22Val81 → AlaE-F loop2 p < 0.001131.0 ± 61.67.7 ± 1.72Thr82 → AlaE-F loop2 p < 0.00135.3 ± 23.17.8 ± 1.02Asn42-Glu-Asp-Leu-Leu46 → (Ala)5C-D loop2 p < 0.00154.0 ± 26.89.4 ± 2.33Tyr403 → AlaF′-G′ loop1—10.4 ± 1.12a No high affinity binding sites were detected.b The dissociation constants ± the standard error were determined from the co-analysis of data obtained from separate binding experiments (39Munson P.J.

The K d values obtained indicate that this variant has normal binding properties. We also included as a control a mutant (Y403A) affected in one of the key ligand-binding residues in domain 4. In agreement with previous studies (30Woodcock J.M. Bagley C.J. Zacharakis B. Lopez A.F. J. Biol.

The first loop of domain 1 to be examined was the A-B loop. This loop consists of residues Tyr15, Thr16, Ser17, and His18. Each residue was individually mutated to alanine, and the resultant mutants were examined for GM-CSF binding. No high affinity GM-CSF receptors were detected on cells co-transfected with cDNAs encoding GM-CSFRα and the mutant βc subunit Y15A (Table I and Fig. 2). This result indicates that Tyr15 is a critical binding determinant in the high affinity binding of GM-CSF. The Scatchard plot of GM-CSF binding with Y15A βc indicates the presence of only low affinity sites. No other residues located in the A-B loop were found to be essential for high affinity binding (Table I). It was also of interest to determine whether phenylalanine could substitute for tyrosine in GM-CSF binding, and therefore the mutant βc, Y15F, was prepared. Y15F was found to give normal high affinity binding (TableI), indicating that the hydroxyl group of Tyr15 is not involved and that Phe is an effective substitution for Tyr at this position. We next examined the involvement of the C-D and E-F loops of domain 1 in GM-CSF binding. The C-D loop consists of residues Asn42, Glu43, Asp44, Leu45, and Leu46. A mutant was generated in which all of the C-D loop residues were mutated to alanine. This mutant gave normal high affinity binding, indicating that the C-D loop is not involved (Table I). The E-F loop is made up of residues Cys76, Gln77, Ser78, Phe79, Val80, Val81, and Thr82. Mutation of the first three residues in the loop to alanine did not affect high affinity GM-CSF binding. The last four residues were individually mutated to alanine. Of these, only Phe79 was found to be required for high affinity GM-CSF binding. The F79A mutation of βc completely abolished high affinity binding (Table I and Fig. 2), indicating that the E-F loop also plays an important role in forming the high affinity GM-CSF complex. To verify that the loss of high affinity binding when the Y15A and F79A βc mutants and GM-CSFRα were co-expressed did not result from a perturbation of the receptor translation, folding, or presence on the cell surface, flow cytometry was used to detect βc cell surface expression. COS7 cells transiently expressing wild type or mutant βc subunits were stained with rabbit antiserum raised against the human βc(HL60) extracellular domain and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody and examined by indirect flow cytometry (Fig. 3). The antiserum used was shown to immunoprecipitate human βc from CTLL-2 GM-CSFRα/βc cell lysates, and the affinity of the antiserum for the human βc extracellular domain was verified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 2S. E. Gustin, J. M. Murphy, and I. G. Young, unpublished results. The level of cell surface expression of the Y15A and F79A mutant βc subunits was observed to be equivalent to wild type βc expression with only small variations observed because of differences in transfection efficiency. Although the formation of a high affinity complex is believed to be a prerequisite for receptor activation and downstream signaling, we considered it important to correlate the binding data with an unequivocal signaling response, in this case proliferation. The GM-CSFRα cDNA was installed in the murine IL-2-dependent lymphoid cell line, CTLL-2, using the pEF-IRES-N vector, which encodes G418 resistance. G418-resistant cells were subsequently transfected with wild type or mutant βc cDNAs in the vector pEF-IRES-P, which encodes puromycin resistance. Following selection with these antibiotics, resistant cells, which had been maintained in the presence of murine IL-2, were used in proliferation assays to assess their responsiveness to GM-CSF after murine IL-2 was removed. The dose of GM-CSF required for half-maximal stimulation of each cell line (ED50) was determined by GM-CSF titration. The amount of GM-CSF giving 50% of maximal stimulation of the CTLL-2 cell line co-expressing the wild type βc and GM-CSFRα subunits was defined as 1 unit, and the relative amounts of GM-CSF required for 50% stimulation of cell lines expressing mutant receptors were determined. Duplicate CTLL-2 cell lines co-expressing the Y15A or F79A mutant βc and GM-CSFRα subunits were generated from separate transfections. The transfected cells expressing the mutant receptors exhibited severely reduced responsiveness to GM-CSF compared with cells expressing the wild type receptor (Table II). The amount of GM-CSF for a 50% growth response was increased 55–85-fold for Y15A and 8–16-fold for F79A. The parent cell line, CTLL-2 GM-CSFRα, did not respond detectably to GM-CSF, even at doses in excess of 2000 ED50 units, verifying the absolute requirement of βc for the growth response.Table IIProliferation of CTLL-2 cell lines expressing reconstituted wild type or mutant GM-CSF or IL-5 receptorsβc subunitTransfection numberUnits of GM-CSF for 50% growthaAverage of ED50 values determined for ≥2 replicate proliferation assays for CTLL-2 cells co-expressing the GM-CSFRα subunit.Units of IL-5 for 50% growthbAverage of ED50 values determined for ≥2 replicate proliferation assays for CTLL-2 cells co-expressing the IL-5Rα subunit.Wild type βc1112—cOnly one stable transfection performed.1.93Y15A βc154.5>250285.1>250F79A βc116.415.227.87.4a Average of ED50 values determined for ≥2 replicate proliferation assays for CTLL-2 cells co-expressing the GM-CSFRα subunit.b Average of ED50 values determined for ≥2 replicate proliferation assays for CTLL-2 cells co-expressing the IL-5Rα subunit.c Only one stable transfection performed.

Although most known signaling events are mediated through tyrosine residues located within IL-2Rβ, no functions have yet been ascribed to γc tyrosine residues. In this study, we describe a role for γc tyrosines in anti-apoptotic signal transduction. We have shown previously that a tyrosine-deficient IL-2Rβ chain paired with wild type γc stimulated enhancement of bcl-2 mRNA in IL-2-dependent T cells, but it was not determined which region of the IL-2R or which pathway was activated to direct this signaling response. Here we show that up-regulation of Bcl-2 by an IL-2R lacking IL-2Rβ tyrosine residues leads to increased cell survival after cytokine deprivation; strikingly, this survival signal does not occur in the absence of γc tyrosine residues. These γc-dependent signals are revealed only in the absence of IL-2Rβ tyrosines, indicating that the IL-2R engages at least two distinct signaling pathways to regulate apoptosis and Bcl-2 expression. Mechanistically, the γc-dependent signal requires activation of Janus kinases 1 and 3 and is sensitive to wortmannin, implicating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Consistent with involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Akt can be activated via tyrosine residues on γc. Thus, γc mediates an anti-apoptotic signaling pathway through Akt which cooperates with signals from its partner chain, IL-2Rβ.

Indeed, a detailed understanding of cytokine receptor structure and dynamics at the molecular level has proven useful in several therapeutic modalities to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases (1Waldmann T.A. Ann. Oncol. 2000; 11: 101-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2O'Dell J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This paper focuses on structure-function relationships in the interleukin (IL)1-2 receptor (IL-2R), which is a prototypical member of the type I cytokine receptor superfamily (3Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1869) Google Scholar). IL-2 is a crucial regulator of T cell proliferation, survival, and programmed cell death (apoptosis) (for review, see Ref. 4Lenardo M. Chan F.K.-M. Hornung F. McFarland H. Siegel R. Wang J. Zheng L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 221-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The IL-2R is a highly complex receptor that employs multiple subunits to activate a remarkable variety of cellular signaling cascades (for review, see Ref. 5Gaffen S.L. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Despite a wealth of information about the IL-2R system gained in the last decade, it is still not fully understood how the various subunits within the IL-2R act in a coordinated fashion to trigger a coherent array of signaling pathways.Most cytokine receptors are composed of multiple subunits, existing either as homomers of identical subunits (such as the erythropoietin (EPO) and tumor necrosis factor receptors) or as heteromers of distinct proteins (such as the IL-2 and interferon receptors). In addition, many cytokine receptor complexes share one or more subunits with other receptors; this is especially true of the type I family of cytokine receptors. The members of this family are characterized by several conserved structural features, including spaced cysteines and WSXWS motifs in their extracellular domains, and canonical box 1 and box 2 domains and tyrosine residues in their cytoplasmic tails. There are several subfamilies of the type I receptors, which are defined by the subunits that they share. For instance, the IL-3, -5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors employ an identical receptor subunit termed βc, and the IL-6 family of receptors shares the gp130 subunit (for review, see Ref. 6Ozaki K. Leonard W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29355-29358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Similarly, the IL-2 family of receptors is defined by their use of the common γ (γc) subunit. Originally identified as the IL-2Rγ chain (7Takeshita T. Asao H. Ohtani K. Ishii N. Kumaki S. Tanaka N. Munakata H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Science. 1992; 257: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), γc is now recognized to be an essential component of the IL-2, -4, -7, -9, -15, and -21 receptors (8Leonard W.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 5631-5635Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9Vosshenrich C.A.J. Di Santo J.P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R175-R177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Humans with genetic deficiencies in γc suffer X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome caused by a phenotypic loss of these cytokines (for review, see Refs. 8Leonard W.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 5631-5635Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar and10Candotti F. Notarangelo L. Visconti R. O'Shea J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Upon interaction with their ligands, type I cytokine receptors activate numerous downstream signaling molecules, including Janus kinases (JAK), signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K), and/or suppressors of cytokine signaling. Signaling pathways involving these molecules are initiated by recruiting signaling intermediates to the receptor complex, usually to phosphorylated tyrosines located on the receptor's cytoplasmic tail. In some cases, signaling molecules bind directly to the receptor, via phosphotyrosine-binding motifs such as Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine binding domains. Alternatively, sometimes one or more adaptor molecules are used to bridge the signaling intermediate to the receptor. Therefore, tyrosines in cytokine receptor tails are crucial launching points for signaling pathways, and much effort has been directed to mapping specific signaling pathways to individual tyrosine residues within cytokine receptors (e.g. Refs. 11Friedmann M.C. Migone T.-S. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2077-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholarand 12Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Ha M. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Greene W.C. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21381-21390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).At the level of the receptor, it is clear that signaling requires a cooperative interaction between receptor subunits. Indeed, for nearly all cytokines, dimerization or multimerization of receptor subunits is essential for signaling (13Stroud R.M. LaPorte S. Wells J.A. Oppenheim J. Feldmann M. Cytokine Reference: Ligands. 1. Academic Press, San Diego2001: 21-34Google Scholar). In the case of receptors belonging to the type I family, mutational analyses have shown that both subunits in the complex must have functional JAK binding domains, which are located in the conserved box 1 and box 2 domains (14Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Cur. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Dimerization then permits trans-phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the associated JAKs (15Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 817-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 16Watowich S. Liu K.D. Xie X. Lai S.Y. Mikami A. Longmore G.D. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5415-5421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) followed by phosphorylation of the receptor tails on distal tyrosine residues.Apart from JAK activation, are all subunits within a multimeric receptor complex necessary for signal transduction? In some circumstances, effective signaling is maintained even when large distal regions of the receptors are deleted by mutagenesis. For example, in the homodimeric erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), it has been shown that both JAK2 binding sites within the receptor tail must be present for STAT activation, but only one distal tail is required to be present (16Watowich S. Liu K.D. Xie X. Lai S.Y. Mikami A. Longmore G.D. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5415-5421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Frequently, multiple tyrosines within the cytoplasmic tail of a single receptor are able to activate identical pathways. For instance, in the EPOR, four different tyrosine residues are capable of activating the transcription factor STAT5 (17Damen J.E. Wakao H. Miyajima A. Krosi J. Humphries R.K. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5557-5568Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 18Gobert S. Chretien S. Gouilleux F. Muller O. Pallard C. Dusanter-Fourt I. Groner B. Lacombe C. Gisselbrecht S. Mayeux P.

A. 1996; 93: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Thus, homodimeric receptors apparently contain duplicated signaling domains, any one of which can activate downstream pathways such as STAT activation. Although these duplicated domains may serve to amplify or fine tune signaling responses (as has been demonstrated for tyrosine-containing motifs in the T cell receptor (20Irving B.A. Chan A.C. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar)), they may serve as redundant or “backup” mechanisms to ensure that essential pathways are activated.Duplicated signaling domains also appear to exist in heteromeric receptors such as the IL-2R, although the receptor subunits contribute differentially to signaling (5Gaffen S.L. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Ha M. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Greene W.C. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol.

The IL-2Rα is an affinity modulator that is dispensable for signaling, although it is essential in vivo for detection of physiological levels of IL-2. In contrast, IL-2Rβ and γc are necessary and sufficient for signaling. Both IL-2Rβ and γc are phosphorylated after receptor ligation (25Sugamura K. Takeshita T. Asao H. Kumaki S. Ohbo K. Ohtani K. Nakamura M. Lymphokine Res. 1990; 9: 539-543PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mills G.B. May C. McGill M. Fung M. Baker M. Sutherland R. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3561-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both subunits are highly conserved in mammalian evolution. The functional roles of tyrosine residues within the IL-2Rβ chain have been carefully examined, and several important signaling pathways have been found to be strictly dependent on tyrosines within this subunit. For example, Tyr-338 recruits the adaptor molecule Shc and activates the p38-MAPK pathway, leading to c-fos gene expression (27Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1599-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ravichandran K.S. Igras V. Schoelson S.E. Fesik S.W. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28858-28863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Moreover, Tyr-338 is the only tyrosine within the IL-2R complex capable of activating this pathway. In contrast, three different tyrosine residues (Tyr-338, Tyr-392, and Tyr-510) all activate STAT5 and proliferation independently (11Friedmann M.C. Migone T.-S. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2077-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 12Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Ha M. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Greene W.C. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21381-21390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although multiple IL-2Rβ tyrosines can activate these pathways, tyrosines in γc cannot do so. Both the MAPK and STAT5 activation proceed normally even in the absence of tyrosine residues on γc (12Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Ha M. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Greene W.C. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21381-21390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7192-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Conversely, tyrosines within γc cannot compensate for an absence of tyrosine residues on IL-2Rβ (11Friedmann M.C. Migone T.-S. Russell S.M. Leonard W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2077-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Goldsmith M.A. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Amaral M.C. Kuczek E.S. Parent L.J.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 309-317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, replacing γc with a heterologous cytokine receptor (the EPOR) does not have a noticeably deleterious effect on these signals, as long as IL-2Rβ tyrosines are retained (21Lai S.Y. Xu W. Gaffen S. Liu K.D. Greene W.C. Goldsmith M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These findings led to a model in which the only function of the γc cytoplasmic tail is to recruit JAK3 to the receptor complex, whereupon JAK3 is able to phosphorylate JAK1 and permit subsequent signaling via phosphorylated tyrosine residues within IL-2Rβ.Despite the central role of IL-2Rβ tyrosine residues, a number of signals proceed in the absence of tyrosine residues on the IL-2Rβ chain. In particular, the gene encoding Bcl-2, an important anti-apoptotic effector, is still enhanced by a mutant IL-2Rβ that cannot be phosphorylated (12Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Ha M. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Greene W.C. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21381-21390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have indicated that γc appears to be crucial for regulating Bcl-2 in vivo even in the absence of its JAK3 binding domain (31Tsujino S. Di Santo J.P. Takaoka A. McKernan T.L. Noguchi S. Taya C. Yonekawa H. Saito T. Taniguchi T. Fujii H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10514-10519Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, the immune impairment observed in γc-deficient mice can be partially rescued by a bcl-2 transgene (32Kondo M. Akashi K. Domen J. Sugamura K. Weissman I.L. Immunity. 1997; 7: 155-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, given the widespread use of γc as a signaling subunit and the evolutionary conservation of its cytoplasmic tyrosine residues, we hypothesized that γc may engage signaling pathways in addition to JAK3 activation, possibly through its tyrosine residues. Accordingly, we show here that tyrosines within the γc subunit mediate a signaling cascade that leads to up-regulation of Bcl-2 and inhibition of apoptosis, thus revealing a previously unrecognized function for the γc subunit in signal transduction.RESULTSCytoplasmic Tyrosine Residues within IL-2Rβ Are Not Required for Induction of Bcl-2 or Anti-apoptotic SignalingTo define regions within IL-2R subunits involved in engaging anti-apoptotic signal transduction pathways, we used a chimeric receptor system previously established in a murine, IL-2-dependent T cell line, HT-2 (22Goldsmith M.A. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Amaral M.C. Kuczek E.S. Parent L.J. Mills G.B. Tarr K.L. Longmore G.D. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21729-21737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To bypass signaling by the endogenous IL-2R, HT-2 cells were stably transfected with chimeric receptors composed of the extracellular domain of the EPOR fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tails of the IL-2Rβ and γc subunits, termed EPOβ and EPOγ, respectively (Fig.1 A). Many prior studies have confirmed that heterodimerization of the EPOβ and EPOγ cytoplasmic tails via EPO is both necessary and sufficient to direct signaling indistinguishable from the native IL-2R and that neither EPOβ nor EPOγ co-opts endogenous IL-2Rβ or γc subunits for signaling (21Lai S.Y.

Henceforth we shall refer to our findings as IL-2-dependent, recognizing that these are presumably the same signals delivered by the IL-15R.Plasmids encoding the EPO chimeras were stably transfected into HT-2 cells and monoclonal cell lines derived by limiting dilution. All constructs were found to be highly expressed, especially compared with endogenous IL-2Rβ and γc levels, as assessed by Northern blotting (Fig. 1 B). To show that the chimeric receptors activated early responses equivalently, phosphorylation of JAK1 was monitored after treatment with EPO or IL-2 (Fig. 1 C). Phosphorylation of the JAKs requires dimerization of the IL-2Rβ with γc cytoplasmic tails (15Liu K.D. Gaffen S.L. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Curr.

As shown, JAK1 was phosphorylated equivalently after IL-2 and EPO treatment in all lines tested except HT-2.EPOβD258A/γ cells (where the mutation at Asp-258 disrupts JAK1 activation (35Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C.

These data indicate that the EPO chimeras expressed in HT-2 cells are competent to deliver EPO-inducible signals essentially equivalent to those induced by the endogenous IL-2R.IL-2 signaling is known to induce bcl-2 mRNA in hematopoietic cells (12Gaffen S.L.

However, we found previously that an IL-2R composed of a tyrosine-deficient IL-2Rβ chain paired with a wild type γc receptor (i.e. the chimera EPOβYF/γ) is able to stimulate up-regulation of bcl-2 mRNA, thus implicating other signaling pathways in Bcl-2 expression (12Gaffen S.L.

To show that the EPOβYF/γ chimera could also up-regulate the Bcl-2 protein, we performed intracellular staining and Western blotting experiments to visualize Bcl-2 expression levels (Fig.2). As expected, in HT-2 cells expressing either the EPOβ or the EPOγ chimera alone, treatment with EPO did not trigger significant increases in Bcl-2, whereas signaling through the endogenous IL-2R enhanced Bcl-2 expression markedly (Fig. 2,A and B). In contrast, in HT-2.EPOβ/γ cells, almost equivalent levels of Bcl-2 were induced by both EPO and IL-2 (Fig. 2 C). In HT-2.EPOβ/γYF cells, EPO induced Bcl-2 equivalently to the wild type IL-2R, indicating that signaling could proceed in the absence of γc tyrosines (Fig. 2 D). Strikingly, in HT-2.EPOβYF/γ cells, EPO stimulation also caused significant up-regulation of Bcl-2, albeit somewhat reduced compared with the endogenous IL-2R (Fig. 2 E). A similar pattern ofbcl-2 mRNA induction was observed in HT-2.EPOβYF/γ, HT-2.EPOβ/γYF, and HT-2.EPOβ/γ cells (data not shown), suggesting that Bcl-2 regulation occurs at the level of mRNA.Figure 2Tyrosines within the IL-2R β cytoplasmic tail are not required for up-regulation of Bcl-2. HT-2.EPOγ cells (A), HT-2.EPOβ cells (B), HT-2.EPOβ/γ cells (C), HT-2.EPOβ/γYF cells (D), and HT-2.EPOβYF/γ cells (E) were incubated without cytokines (Unstim, filled histograms), 50 units/ml EPO (thick solid line), or 10 nm IL-2 (thin solid line) for 24 h. Cells were permeabilized, stained with anti-Bcl-2-FITC antibodies, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The thin dotted line(Control Ig) corresponds to background fluorescence in cells incubated in IL-2 and stained with isotype-matched control antibodies conjugated to FITC. Experiments were performed multiple times with comparable results. Boxed insets, the indicated cell lines were incubated without cytokines (U) or with EPO (E) or IL-2 (2) for 24 h as described above. Whole cell lysates were prepared from equivalent cell numbers, separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies to murine Bcl-2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To ascertain whether Bcl-2 levels were associated with productive anti-apoptotic signals, cytokines were removed from the growth medium of HT-2.EPOβ/γ or HT-2.EPOβYF/γ cells, and cell viability and progression to apoptosis were monitored by flow cytometry. Cells were treated with IL-2 or EPO and then stained with PI to test for viability and annexin V coupled to GFP (GFP-annexin V (37Ernst J. Yang L. Rosales J. Broaddus V. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)) to test for apoptosis (Fig. 3). Note that stimulation of parental HT-2 cells with EPO does not trigger a detectable anti-apoptotic signal because these cells do not express endogenous EPO receptors (36Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Longmore G.D. Liu K.D. Goldsmith M.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 1-14Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, HT-2.EPOβ/γ cells exhibited strong protection from apoptosis when incubated with EPO or IL-2. In addition, only a small percentage of the viable cells underwent apoptosis in EPO or IL-2, whereas most of the viable (PI-negative) cells were apoptotic in the absence of cytokines (Fig. 3 A). In HT-2.EPOβYF/γ cells, EPO also induced significant protection from apoptosis (Fig.3 B). Similar to our observations with Bcl-2, the protection afforded by EPOβYF/γ was not as vigorous as that by the native IL-2R or the wild type EPOβ/γ chimeras. Part of the basis for the decreased survival is likely the reduced Bcl-2 in these cells (Fig. 2), but additional events may also be required to maintain long term survival (48Vander Heiden M.G. Plas D.R. Rathmell J.C. Fox C.J. Harris M.H. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5899-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Together, these results agreed with previous findings that not all signals by the IL-2R are regulated through IL-2Rβ tyrosine residues (12Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Ha M. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Greene W.C. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21381-21390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These data also raised the question of whether Bcl-2 induction and inhibition of apoptosis involve tyrosines on γc or could occur through pathways completely independent of cytoplasmic tyrosines.Figure 3A tyrosine-deficient IL-2R β chain paired with wild type γc protects HT-2 cells from apoptosis caused by IL-2 withdrawal.HT-2.EPOβ/γ cells (A) and HT-2.EPOβYF/γ cells (B) were incubated for 40 h without cytokines (Unstim.) or with 50 units/ml EPO or 10 nm IL-2, as indicated. Cells were costained with PI and GFP-annexin V (37Ernst J. Yang L. Rosales J. Broaddus V. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 260: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and analyzed by flow cytometry. The top row of histograms shows the viability of the entire population by PI, and the percentages of viable (PI-negative) cells are indicated.

https://openalex.org/W2027824587,"Famoxadone is a new cytochromebc 1 Qo site inhibitor that immobilizes the iron-sulfur protein (ISP) in the bconformation. The effects of famoxadone on electron transfer between the iron-sulfur center (2Fe-2S) and cyt c 1 were studied using a ruthenium dimer to photoinitiate the reaction. The rate constant for electron transfer in the forward direction from 2Fe-2S to cyt c 1 was found to be 16,000 s−1in bovine cyt bc 1. Binding famoxadone decreased this rate constant to 1,480 s−1, consistent with a decrease in mobility of the ISP. Reverse electron transfer from cytc 1 to 2Fe-2S was found to be biphasic in bovine cyt bc 1 with rate constants of 90,000 and 7,300 s−1. In the presence of famoxadone, reverse electron transfer was monophasic with a rate constant of 1,420 s−1. It appears that the rate constants for the release of the oxidized and reduced ISP from the b conformation are the same in the presence of famoxadone. The effects of famoxadone binding on electron transfer were also studied in a series of Rhodobacter sphaeroides cyt bc 1 mutants involving residues at the interface between the Rieske protein and cytc 1 and/or cyt b."

Here we tested the hypothesis that affinity of agonists for binding domain accounts for a ligand-specific desensitization pattern. We generated chimeras using receptors with variable sensitivity to ATP in order: P2X4R > P2X2aR = P2X2bR ≫ P2X7R. Chimeras having the ectodomain Ile66–Tyr310sequence of P2X2R and Val61–Phe313sequence of P2X7R in the backbone of P2X4R were expressed but were non-functioning channels. P2X2a + X4R and P2X2b + X4R chimeras having the Val66–Tyr315 ectodomain sequence of P2X4R in the backbones of P2X2aR and P2X2bR were functional and exhibited increased sensitivity to ligands as compared with both parental receptors. These chimeras also desensitized faster than parental receptors and in a ligand-nonspecific manner. However, like parental P2X2bR and P2X2aR, chimeric P2X2b + X4R desensitized more rapidly than P2X2a + X4R, and the rate of desensitization of P2X2a+X4R increased by substituting its Arg371–Pro376intracellular C-terminal sequence with the Glu376–Gly381 sequence of P2X4R. These results indicate the relevance of interaction between the ectodomain and flanking regions around the transmembrane domains on ligand potency and receptor activation.

Like other ligand-gated receptor channels, P2XRs also become refractory to the stimulus during the sustained agonist occupancy. This process, called desensitization, was initially characterized in acetylcholine receptors by Katz and Thesleff (1Katz B. Thesleff S. J. Physiol. 1957; 138: 63-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) and occurs because receptors enter stable desensitized states in which ion permeation is blocked or attenuated although ligand remains bound. Significant progress has been made recently in characterizing the ectodomain architecture of other ligand-gated receptor channels and the relationship between ligand-binding domain occupancy and receptor activity (2Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 3Sun Y. Olson R. Horning M. Armstrong N. Mayer M. Gouaux E.

However, the boundaries of the ectodomain and ATP-binding domain of P2XRs and the molecular mechanisms of transduction of information from ligand-binding domain to the pore of channels are largely unknown (5North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2471) Google Scholar). Modification at the triphosphate moiety of ATP served well in identification of native P2XR subtypes and provided useful information about the putative ligand-binding domain. For example, the substitution of bridging oxygen between α- and β-phosphorus with a methylene group resulted in a ligand, called αβ-meATP, which is a high potency agonist for P2X1R and P2X3R, low potency agonist for P2X2R, and partial agonist for P2X4R (6Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F. North R.A. Seguela P. Voigt M. Humphrey P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar). High sensitivity of P2X3R to αβ-meATP can be transferred to P2X2aR and P2X2bR subtypes by generating the extracellular chimeras having the ectodomain of the P2X3 subunit in the P2X2-based backbone (7Koshimizu T.

These chimeras also exhibited enhanced rates of desensitization (7Koshimizu T. Ueno S. Tanoue A. Yanagihara N. Stojilkovic S.S. Tsujimoto G. J. Biol.

Within this region, single residue mutation studies have identified positively charged Lys68, Lys70, and Lys309 of P2X1R and the corresponding Lys69 and Lys71 of P2X2R as contributing to the ATP-binding site and control of rate of receptor desensitization (9Ennion S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In general agreement with these observations, the N-terminal half of the P2X3 ectodomain, from Val60 to Arg180, is necessary for high αβ-meATP sensitivity of the receptor. The attempt to further narrow this region was obstructed, indicating that the ectodomain is sensitive to modification by site-directed mutagenesis (7Koshimizu T. Ueno S. Tanoue A. Yanagihara N. Stojilkovic S.S. Tsujimoto G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46891-46899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). P2XRs activate and desensitize in a receptor- and ligand-specific manner. When stimulated with ATP, P2X1R and P2X3R desensitize very rapidly (in an ms time scale), P2X4R and P2X6R desensitize with a moderate rate (within a few seconds), and P2X2R, P2X5R, and P2X7R show little or no desensitization (11Ralevic V. Burnstock G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 413-492PubMed Google Scholar, 12.North, R. A. & Barnard, E. A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 7, 346–357. 97.Google Scholar). Two main hypotheses emerged from previous work on desensitization of P2XRs, one based on the structure of channels and the other based on the actions of intracellular messengers. Heteromultimerization results in P2XRs that desensitize with different kinetics from those seen in cells expressing homomeric receptors (13Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G.

Here, we extended investigations on the relevance of the ectodomain structure on ligand selectivity and the pattern of P2XR desensitization. Experiments were done with wild-type P2X2aR, P2X2bR, and P2X4R and chimeric P2X2a + X4R and P2X2b + X4R containing the ectodomain sequence of P2X4R instead of the corresponding P2X2R sequence. The reverse P2X4 + X2R chimera was also constructed, as well as the P2X4 + X7R chimera containing the ectodomain sequence of P2X7R. To clarify the possible interaction between the ectodomain and C-terminal domain in control of agonist specificity and receptor activity, we also constructed P2X2a-6aa + X4R mutant chimera containing the C-terminal 6-residue sequence of P2X4R instead of the corresponding sequence of P2X2a + X4R. Both whole-cell patch clamp current recordings and calcium measurements were used to estimate the activity of receptors in response to ATP, the native agonist for P2XRs, and two agonist analogs, BzATP and αβ-meATP. The results of these investigations clearly indicate the C-terminal-independent influence of the ectodomain structure on agonist potency and rate of P2XR desensitization. The coding sequences of the rat P2X2a, P2X2b, P2X4 subunits were isolated by reverse transcription-PCR (15Koshimizu T. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37651-37657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the biscistronic enhanced fluorescent protein expression vector, pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech), at the restriction enzyme sites of XhoI/PstI for P2X2aR and P2X2bR and XhoI/EcoRI for P2X4R. Chimera P2X2a + X4R, P2X2b + X4R, P2X4 + X2R, and P2X4 + X7R were directly constructed by overlap extension PCR using the corresponding wild-type P2XRs cDNA as templates. Mutagenesis primers were pairs of chimeric sense and antisense that were 36-mer long with the joint sites positioned at the center. The constructed P2X2a + X4R, P2X2b + X4R chimeric subunits replace Ile66–Tyr310 with Val66–Tyr315 extracellular domain of P2X4R, whereas P2X4 + X2R and P2X4 + X7R contain the Ile66–Tyr310 and Val61–Phe313 sequence of P2X2R and P2X7R, respectively, instead of the native Val66–Tyr315 of P2X4R. We also constructed a mutant of chimera P2X2a + X4R, termed P2X2a-6aa + X4R, by overlap extension PCR, as described previously (15Koshimizu T. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol.

This mutant contains the Glu376–Gly381 sequence of P2X4R instead of the corresponding Arg371–Pro376sequence of P2X2a + X4R. These chimeric P2XRs were subcloned into GFP expression vector pIRES2-EGFP. The identity of all constructs was verified by dye terminator cycle sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), performed by the Laboratory of Molecular Technology (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD). The large scale plasmid DNAs for transfection were prepared using a Qiagen Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen). Mouse immortalized gonadotropin-releasing hormone-secreting cells (hereafter GT1 cells) and human embryonic kidney cells (hereafter HEK293 cells) were used in functional studies of wild-type and mutant P2XRs, as described previously (15Koshimizu T. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37651-37657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). GT1 cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12 medium (1:1) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen) in a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. HEK293 cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 100 μg/ml gentamicin. Before the day of transfection, cells were plated on 25-mm poly-l-lysine (0.01% w/v; Sigma)-coated coverslips at a density of 0.75–1 × 105 cells/35-mm dish. For each dish of cells, transient transfection of expression constructs was conducted using 1 μg of DNA and 7 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in 3 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM. After 6 h of incubation, the transfection mixture was replaced with normal culture medium. Cells were subjected to experiments 24–48 h after transfection. Transfected GT1 cells were preloaded with 1 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2/AM; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 60 min at room temperature in modified Krebs-Ringer buffer: 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mm MgSO4, and 15 mm HEPES plus 1.8 g/liter glucose (pH 7.4). After dye loading, cells were incubated in Modified Krebs-Ringer buffer and kept in the dark for at least 30 min before single-cell [Ca2+]i measurements. Coverslips with cells were mounted on the stage of an Axiovert 135 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) attached to the Attofluor digital fluorescence microscopy system (Atto Instruments, Rockville, MD). Cells were stimulated with various doses of agonists, the dynamic changes of [Ca2+]i were examined under a ×40 oil immersion objective during exposure to alternating 340- and 380-nm light beams, and the intensity of light emission at 520 nm was measured. The ratio of light intensities, F340/F380, which reflects changes in [Ca2+]i, was simultaneously followed in several single cells. GFP was used as a marker for cells with P2XR expression as described previously (15Koshimizu T. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37651-37657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cells expressing GFP were optically detected by an emission signal at 520 nm when excited by a 488-nm ultraviolet light. Experiments were done in cells with comparable GFP fluorescence signals (about 60 arbitrary units), and no repetitive stimulation was done to avoid the possible impact of desensitization on the amplitude and pattern of [Ca2+]i signals. Electrophysiological experiments were performed on HEK293 cells at room temperature using whole-cell patch clamp recording techniques (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15140) Google Scholar). ATP-induced currents were recorded using an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and were filtered at 2 kHz using a low pass Bessel filter. 40–70% series resistance compensation was used. Patch electrodes, fabricated from borosilicate glass (type 1B150F-3; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) using a Flaming Brown horizontal puller (P-87; Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA), were heat-polished to a final tip resistance of 3–5 megaohms. All current records were captured and stored using the pClamp 8 software packages in conjunction with the Digidata 1322A A/D converter (Axon Instruments). Patch electrodes were filled with a solution containing 140 mmKCl, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES; the pH was adjusted with 1 m KOH to 7.2. The osmolarity of the internal solutions was 282–287 mosm. The bath solution contained 142 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES; the pH was adjusted to 7.3 with 1 m NaOH. The osmolarity of this solution was 285–295 mosm. A 3 m KCl agar bridge was placed between the bathing solution and the reference electrode. ATP was applied for 60 s using a fast gravity-driven microperfusion system (BPS-8, ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY). The application tip was routinely positioned about 500 μm above the recorded cell. Less than 600 ms was required for complete exchange of solutions around the patched cells, as estimated from altered potassium current (10–90% rise time). The time between each ATP application was about 10 min to allow recovery from receptor desensitization. The time course of the [Ca2+]i was fitted to a single exponential function (ae −ktb+b) using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) to generate the rates of signaling desensitization (k) and half-times of decay (τ = ln2/k). The time courses of currents evoked by sustained ATP stimulation were fitted to a single exponential function using the pClamp 8 program (Axon Instruments). Significant differences, with p < 0.05, were determined by one-way analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. Concentration-response relationships were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation using a non-linear curve-fitting program, which derives 50% efficient concentrations (EC50) and 50% desensitizing concentrations (DC50) (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA). When expressed in GT1 cells under identical experimental conditions, parental receptors P2X2aR, P2X2bR, and P2X4R responded to ATP, BzATP, and αβ-meATP stimulation with a rapid rise in [Ca2+]i followed by a gradual decline toward steady plateau levels. In accordance with previously published data (8He M.-L. Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1187-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Van Goor F. Stojilkovic S.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 901-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), in all agonist concentrations studied, the peak [Ca2+]i responses were comparable in P2X2aR- and P2X2bR-expressing cells. Fig. 1 A illustrates the concentration dependence of three agonists on the peak amplitude of [Ca2+]i responses for both receptor subtypes combined. The calculated EC50 values (Fig. 1, dotted vertical lines) were in general agreement with the data in the literature (6Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F. North R.A. Seguela P. Voigt M. Humphrey P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar): ATP was the most potent agonist for P2X2Rs, followed by BzATP, whereas αβ-meATP acted as a low potency agonist. On the other hand, the estimated EC50 values for ATP, BzATP, and αβ-meATP in GT1 cells expressing rat P2X4R (Fig. 1 B) differed significantly from previously published data (reviewed in Ref. 6Khakh B.S. Burnstock G. Kennedy C. King B.F. North R.A. Seguela P. Voigt M. Humphrey P.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 107-118PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, ATP was a highly potent agonist for these receptors, with an EC50 of about 1 μm, and the calculated EC50 for BzATP was 2.5 μm as compared with >500 μm reported in other expression systems. At supramaximal concentrations, the peak amplitudes of ATP- and BzATP-induced [Ca2+]iresponses in P2X4R-expressing cells were about 40% of those observed in P2X2R-expressing cells, whereas the peak amplitudes of current responses were comparable (Fig. 1). αβ-meATP-induced peak current/[Ca2+]iresponses were 44% as compared with those in ATP- and BzATP-stimulated cells, consistent with the partial agonist action of this ATP analog observed in other expression systems (31Jones C.A. Chessell I.P. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Miller K.J. Michel A.D. Humphrey P.P.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), but the calculated EC50 was 4 μm (Fig. 1 B). The P2X2a + X4R and P2X2b + X4R chimeras having the ectodomain of P2X4R in the backbone of P2X2aR and P2X2bR, respectively, were functional and responded to three agonists in a concentration-dependent manner with highly comparable peak amplitudes. Fig. 1 C illustrates the combined results for both receptors. Chimeric receptors differed from parental receptors in two respects. First, although the structure of the pore was not altered, the peak amplitudes of [Ca2+]i responses in chimeric receptors were 80% of those observed in P2X2aR- and P2X2bR-expressing cells (p < 0.01 in the 10–1000 μmconcentration range of ATP). Second, chimeric receptors exhibited higher sensitivity to ATP as compared with both parental receptors, and αβ-meATP exhibited the full agonistic action as compared with partial agonistic action in P2X4R- expressing cells. The reverse P2X4 + X2R chimera, having the ectodomain of P2X2R inserted into the backbone of P2X4R, was expressed at the levels comparable with those observed in experiments with P2X2a + X4R and P2X2b + X4R, as estimated by GFP fluorescence intensity. However, the receptor did not respond to ATP in the 1–1000 μm concentration range. The lack of effects of ATP was not due to the endogenous desensitization of receptors because ATP was also ineffective in cells cultured in the presence of apyrase, an ectoATPase. Also, the P2X4 + X7R chimera having the ectodomain of P2X7R instead of P2X4R was expressed but was not functional in the presence or absence of apyrase. All together, experiments with chimeras suggested that although the ectodomain sequences we selected contained several residues critical for ligand binding, they were not sufficient to preserve intact ligand-binding domains. The P2X4R-specific ligand potency was enhanced, whereas the P2X2R- and P2X7R-specific ligand potency was abolished in chimeric channels, indicating the interaction between the ectodomain and nearby residues. To characterize the pattern of receptor desensitization and its impact on calcium signaling, both current and calcium measurements were used. Fig.2 A illustrates typical profiles of ATP (100 μm)-induced current responses in cells expressing wild-type P2X2aR, P2X2bR, and P2X4R. The peak amplitudes of current responses were in high pA (P2X4R) to low nA (P2X2aR and P2X2bR) range. Consistent with previously published data (16Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12853-12857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), P2X2aR desensitized slowly and incompletely, reaching the steady levels with a τ of 22 s, whereas P2X2bR desensitized rapidly with a calculated τ of about 4 s. P2X4R desensitized to the steady levels comparable with P2X2bR but with a τ of about 9 s. The significance of receptor-specific desensitization pattern on [Ca2+]i response is illustrated in Fig.2 B. Three receptors generated calcium signals, which differed in profiles. The rates of signal desensitization (expressed as τ) were: 96 s in P2X2aR-expressing cells, 18 s in P2X2bR-expressing cells, and 45 s in P2X4R-expressing cells. Differences in the calculated τ values in current and [Ca2+]imeasurements illustrate the impact of calcium-handling mechanisms of the cells used in experiments on the rate of receptor desensitization. On the other hand, the relative ratios in the rates of P2X2aR, P2X2bR, and P2X4R desensitization estimated from two measurements were highly comparable. This clearly indicates that [Ca2+]i measurements not only provide information about the physiological relevance of receptor activation and desensitization but also could be used as valuable parameters in characterizing the nature of P2XR desensitization, at least for slower desensitizing receptors. A comparison between the patterns of current responses in cells expressing wild-type P2X2aR and P2X2bR and chimeric receptors is shown in Fig. 3. The substitution of the native P2X2aR ectodomain with P2X4 ectodomain dramatically enhanced the rate of receptor desensitization (Fig. 3 B). Significant differences were also observed between P2X2bR and P2X2b + X4R (Fig. 3 A). Both chimeric receptors also desensitized more rapidly than P2X4R (Fig. 3 versus Fig. 2). The same conclusion was reached in experiments with single cell calcium measurements. As shown in Fig.4 A, calcium signals desensitized more rapidly in cells expressing chimeric receptors when stimulated with 10 μm ATP (upper panels) and 100 μm ATP (lower panels). In parallel with changes in the EC50 values for chimeric receptors (Fig. 1), calcium signals also desensitized with about one log unit leftward shift in the DC50 values as compared with parental P2X2Rs (Fig. 4 B). The ratios between τ values for current and calcium measurements in cells expressing two chimeric receptors were comparable with those observed in parental receptors. These results clearly indicate the relevance of the ectodomain structure on the kinetics of receptor desensitization and suggest that the ligand potency reflects on rate of receptor desensitization.Figure 4Influence of ectodomain and C-terminal domain on acceleration of P2X2a + X4R and P2X2b + X4R desensitization (calcium recordings).

To test this hypothesis further, we generated P2X2a-6aa+X4R mutant chimera, having the Glu376–Gly381 C-terminal sequence of P2X4R instead of the Arg371–Pro376sequence of P2X2a+X4R. Our earlier studies have shown the relevance of Arg371–Pro376 in slowing the rate of receptor desensitization (16Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12853-12857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Substitution of this sequence with the Glu376–Gly381 sequence of P2X4R increased the rate of P2X2aR desensitization (15Koshimizu T. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37651-37657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In accordance with these observations, P2X2a-6aa + X4R mutant chimera showed an increased rate of desensitization as compared with P2X2a + X4R chimera (Fig. 4 C), and the ratio between the rates of P2X2a + X4R, P2X2a-6aa + X4R, and P2X2b + X4R was comparable with that observed in cells expressing P2X2aR, P2X2a-6aaR, and P2X2bR (15Koshimizu T.

https://openalex.org/W2026234852,"Nitric oxide (NO) is an important molecule with diverse bio-messenger functions including regulation of gene expression. Transcriptional studies using sensitive luciferase reporter systems have suggested that NO inhibits the promoter activity of a variety of genes. Here we report that NO donors (sodium nitroprusside, 2′,2′-(hydroxynitrosohydrazono)bis-ethanimine, and (±)-(E)-4-ethyl-2-[(Z)-hydroxyimino]-5-nitro-3-hexen-1-yl-nicotinamide) decrease luciferase activity in a promoter-independent fashion in both viral and eukaryotic promoters, with a reduction to nearly 50% in the presence of 100 μm NO donor. Addition of an SV40 enhancer downstream of the luciferase coding region shifted NO donor inhibition to the right, with inhibition at ∼300 μm. In contrast, when studied in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter, two promoters indicating inhibition by NO were unaffected. The decrease in luciferase activity was not caused by NO suppression of the luciferase enzyme. Real-time PCR data showed that luciferase mRNA half-life decreased by nearly half in the presence of NO donor (from 75 to 45 min). The SV40 enhancer prolonged luciferase mRNA half-life and somewhat blunted the NO effect. Our data suggest that exogenous NO inhibits luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner through decreasing luciferase mRNA stability. Thus, the use of luciferase reporter systems to study transcriptional regulation by NO should be attempted with caution.

Many reports have shown that NO alters proteins by regulating gene transcription through alterations in promoter specific activity; i.e. NO has been reported to suppress both Egr-1 (2Chiu J.J.

Commun. 2001; 186: 529-533Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ability of nitric oxide to up-regulate promoter activity has been less well reported, although many proteins are increased after exposure to nitric oxide (9Fukai T.

We also found that nitric oxide inhibited the expression of a protein we were interested in; when we turned to transcriptional assays, we also measured effects of the permeable molecule on promoter-driven firefly luciferase. However, while studying a series of promoter deletions, we found that the effect of nitric oxide seemed to be nonspecific. This led us to consider whether our findings might be explained by a more general effect of NO on the luciferase reporter system. Since the first descriptions of firefly luciferase as a highly sensitive, rapid, and easy-to-perform assay (12Brasier A. Tate J. Habener J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 1116-1122PubMed Google Scholar, 13de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 1989; 176: 26-32Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), luciferase assay has become perhaps the most commonly used method for monitoring promoter activity. We chose three structurally different NO donors to test both viral and eukaryotic promoters linked to the luciferase reporter gene. Our experience, reported here, shows that NO donors significantly repressed luciferase activity in a promoter-independent fashion. Our data also show a direct effect of nitric oxide to shorten the half-life of the luciferase message, revealing at least one mechanism by which NO might have nonspecific effects on this reporter system. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP), 2′,2′-(hydroxynitrosohydrazono)bis-ethanimine (Deta/NO), and (±)-(E)-4-ethyl-2-[(Z)-hydroxyimino]-5-nitro-3-hexen-1-yl-nicotinamide (NOR4) were obtained from Sigma/Cell Signaling & Neuroscience. pGL3-Control “pGL3-SV40 (SV40Enhancer)-Luc” and the pGL3-Promoter “pGL3-SV40-Luc” were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). pcDNA/CAT and LipofectAMINE were from Invitrogen. The 4xVDRE was inserted into pTK-Luc vector. The macrophage colony stimulating factor (MCSF) promoter and the receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) promoter were inserted into both pGL3-Basic and pGL3-Enhancer. pCAT-MCSF was generously provided by Dr. M. Harrington (Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN) (15Harrington M. Edenberg H. Saxman S. Pedigo L. Daub R. Broxmeyer H. Gene. 1991; 102: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). DNase I was obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma or are specifically noted otherwise. The ST-2 murine bone stromal cell line was purchased from Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba Science City, Japan) and maintained in α-minimal essential medium with 10% FBS. HepG2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. ST-2 cells and HepG2 cells were seeded at a density of 150,000/well in six-well plates. After 18–20 h, cells were transfected with 1.6 μg/well of DNA and 8 μl of LipofectAMINE in the absence of serum. Five hours later, an equal volume of medium with serum was added to bring the final concentration of serum to 10%. The next day, media was changed, and NO donors were added to cultures as specified. To assess luciferase activity, the Promegaluciferase assay system was used. Briefly, reporter lysis buffer was added and incubated at room temperature for 15 min before centrifugation to remove cell debris. For the assay, 20 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase substrate, and light emission was measured with the LumiCount Luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In some experiments, cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3/CAT to allow for normalization to CAT activity. CAT normalized results were not different from those normalized by protein content (Bio-Rad detergent-compatible assay) or expressed as luciferase activity alone. ST-2 cells were transfected with CAT reporter vector and treated with Deta/NO for 24 h. Cell lysates were collected 48 h after transfection and heated at 60 °C for 10 min to inactivate endogenous deacetylase activity. For the assay, 100 μl of lysate was mixed with [14C]chloramphenicol andn-butyryl coenzyme A at 37 °C overnight. Samples were extracted with xylene and counted in a 2500 TR liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer) as described in the Promega protocol. After ST-2 cells were treated with Deta/NO, total RNA was extracted by TRIzol as described in the Invitrogen protocol. DNase I treatment alone could not sufficiently eliminate plasmid DNA contamination in our samples, as shown by persistent presence of significant amplicons as assessed by nonsignificant differences in cycle thresholds (CT values) between RNA samples for negative control (i.e. not reverse-transcribed) and samples that had been reverse transcribed. To decontaminate preparations of plasmid DNA, RNA samples (5–6 μg) were incubated with 30 U RsaI, which generated multiple cuts in the luciferase coding region (particularly inside the luciferase PCR amplicon; see below). To study possible NO effects on the CAT reporter message, the lysates containing plasmid were cut with SspI. After incubation for 1 h, the samples were heated at 65 °C for 10 min, and RNA was re-extracted with the RNAeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Finally, 10 units of DNase I (DNA-free DNase treatment and removal reagents; Ambion) was added to each sample at 37 °C for 30 min followed by application of the DNase I removal reagent. The samples were stored at −70 °C. Analysis of Luciferase, CAT, and 18 S mRNA was performed using the iCycler (Bio-Rad). Reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA was performed with random decamers (Ambion) and superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in total volume of 20 μl. For real-time PCR, amplification reactions were performed in 25 μl containing primers at 0.5 μm and dNTPs (0.2 mm each) in PCR buffer and 0.03 units ofTaq polymerase (Invitrogen) and SYBR-green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 1:150,000. Aliquots of cDNA were diluted 10–10,000-fold for 18 S and 5–625-fold for luciferase as well as CAT to generate relative standard curves to which sample cDNA was compared (16Johnson M.R. Wang K.

Real-time PCR to identify CAT mRNA, represented by a 133-bp amplicon, used the forward primer sequence 5′-GCG TGT TAC GGT GAA AAC CT-3′ and the reverse primer sequence 5′-GGG CGA AGA AGT TGT CCA TA-3′. For 18 S, an amplicon of 345 bp was generated with forward primer 5′-GAA CGT CTG CCC TAT CAA CT-3′and reverse primer 5′-CCA AGA TCC AAC TAC GAG CT-3′ (17Rubin J. Murphy T. Fan X. Goldschmidt M. Taylor W. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1452-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Standards and samples were run in triplicate. Dilution curves showed that PCR efficiency was more than 90% for luciferase, CAT and 18 S amplicons. Negative controls, such as samples without RT and PCR mixtures lacking both cDNA and RNA were also set up for each real-time PCR to ensure elimination of plasmid DNA. PCR product arising from RNA samples that were not reverse-transcribed had CTvalues of 27.9 ± 0.56 for luciferase, 28.4 ± 0.3 for CAT, and 32.1 ± 0.95 for 18 S; this was not significantly different from data generated from sample buffer alone with CT values of 29.03 ± 0.38 for luciferase and 32.25 ± 0.99 for 18 S. Luciferase values were normalized for the amount of 18 S in the same RT sample, which was also standardized on a dilution curve from RT sample as described in the literature (16Johnson M.R. Wang K. Smith J.B. Heslin M.J. Diasio R.B. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 278: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 19Schmittgen T.D. Zakrajsek B.A. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 2000; 46: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was evaluated by Dunnett one-way analysis of variance or t test (Prism; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Nitric oxide has been shown to repress the activities of multiple promoters studied with luciferase reporter plasmids, yet no specific sequences have been associated with this down-regulation. To assess whether this effect might be nonspecific, we tested several constructs, including those available commercially as well as some of particular interest to our laboratory. These are shown in Fig. 1 a and include both those derived from pGL3-Basic and those where a SV40 enhancer was placed downstream of the poly(A) signal as in the “pGL3-Enhancer” vector. ST-2 bone stromal cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter constructs and treated with the nitric oxide donor SNP for 20 h (overnight) at variable concentrations. Fig. 1, b–e, shows that the luciferase activity in multiple constructs significantly decreased with the addition of 100 μm SNP. These constructs represent both viral (CMV promoter, Fig. 1 b; SV40 promoter, Fig. 1 d), as well as a concatameric consensus sequence representing the vitamin D response element associated with a minimal thymidine kinase promoter (Fig. 1 c) and 774-nucleotide sequence from the murine MCSF promoter (Fig.1 e) (20Rubin J. Fan D. Wade A. Murphy T. Gewant H. Nanes M. Fan X. Moerenhout M. Hofstetter W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 160: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Further reduction in luciferase activity was seen with the addition of 300 μm SNP to cells transfected with the constructs. When the SV40 enhancer was included as part of the promoter construct, added downstream of the poly(A) signal, the inhibitory effect of SNP was blunted with significant inhibition by 40% achieved only at 300 μm SNP; this was seen with both the viral and the eukaryotic promoters studies in Fig. 1, fand g. To ascertain whether these general effects were confined to the specific NO donor SNP, we also studied two other NO donors: Deta/NO, which is a long lasting NO donor (half-life ∼20 h at 37 °C) (21Bouton C. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32688-32693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,22Keefer L.K. Nims R.W. Davies K.M. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 281-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and NOR4, a short lasting NO donor (half-life ∼1 h). ST-2 cells were cultured in same condition as the SNP group above but treated with Deta/NO or NOR4. The NOR4 was added twice because of its short half-life, at 0 and 6 h. For data shown in Fig.2, ST-2 cells were transfected with pGL3-CMV-Luc (without SV40 enhancer) or pGL3-SV40 (SV40Enhancer)-Luc before treatment with 0–300 μm of Deta/NO for 20–24 h. Deta/NO at 300 μm decreased luciferase activities in both reporter constructs. However, luciferase activity was inhibited at 100 μm of Deta/NO in pGL3-CMV-Luc, in which there was no SV40 enhancer downstream of the luciferase gene; activity was similar at 100 μm SNP (Fig. 2 a) but required 300 μm to significantly repress a construct containing the SV40 enhancer (Fig. 2 b). Similar results were found when the donor NOR4 was studied along with SNP in ST-2 cell cultures transfected with the pGL3-RANKL-Luc construct, again showing that 100 μm of this donor was able to repress the SV40 enhancer-less construct (Fig. 2 c). These results demonstrate that commonly used NO donors cause a significant decrease in luciferase expression in all promoter constructs studied. The inhibitory effect of NO donors on luciferase activity in multiple unrelated promoter constructs could be explained either by a direct effect of nitric oxide to inhibit promoter activity or a direct effect on luciferase mRNA processing or luciferase activity. To examine the first possibility, the effect of NO donors was examined using two promoters studied previously in the luciferase reporters but here with a CAT reporter system: pcDNA3/CAT, which contained the CMV viral promoter, and pCAT-MCSF, containing the same nucleotide sequence of the MCSF promoter studied in Fig. 1 (Fig.3 a). ST-2 cells were transfected with these two constructs. When cells transfected with pcDNA/CAT (CMV promoter) were treated with Deta/NO overnight (∼48 h after transfection), CAT activities did not change even when 500 μm of Deta/NO was added (Fig.3 b) in contrast with the inhibitory effect seen in Fig.2 a. We also compared the promoter activities when treated with Deta/NO in either pCAT-MCSF or pGL3-MCSF-Luc. As shown in Fig.3 c, 300 μm of Deta/NO had no significant effect on CAT activity (unchanged from control levels), whereas the expected 50% reduction in luciferase activity was seen in the same promoter driving the luciferase reporter. These results suggested that the inhibitory effects of NO donors on luciferase activity were not caused by NO effects on promoter-initiated transcription. We next investigated whether the NO donor or its metabolites might directly inhibit luciferase activity in the sample lysates. Cell lysates were made from ST-2 cells transfected with pTK-4xVDRE-Luc. Before luciferase assay, samples were incubated with different doses of the short half-life NO donor NOR4 for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 4 a, luciferase activities were not changed with increasing NOR 4 added from 0 to 500 μm. We next examined whether a metabolic product of the NO donor might affect luciferase activity in the lysate. ST-2 cell lysates were collected from cells previously transfected with pGL3-MCSF-Luc and mixed with lysates made from ST-2 cells untreated or treated for 24 h with 300 μm Deta/NO, the long acting NO donor. Assays showed that addition of ST-2 cell lysates containing NO or its metabolites did not change luciferase activity (Fig. 4 b). We further examined whether NO donor repression of luciferase activity was caused by changes in luciferase mRNA levels. For these experiments, we used 300 μm of Deta/NO to treat ST-2 cells transfected with pGL3-MCSF-Luc. Real-time PCR analysis was used to measure amounts of luciferase mRNA that were normalized to 18 S mRNA levels from real-time PCR in each sample. Care was taken to rule out plasmid DNA contamination (from the transfection of plasmid) in the RNA samples. In our hands, neither the protocol outlined by Cok and Morrison (18Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), in which RNA samples were treated twice with DNase I, nor the Ambion protocol, in which samples were heated before DNase I digestion, was able to ensure that DNA contamination was removed: both protocols showed the same threshold cycles of either RNA samples only (without RT as negative control, equivalent amount of RNA for RT reaction) or from RT products for luciferase detection (data not shown). To overcome this obstacle, we added a new step in which samples were treated with the endonuclease RsaI, which generated multiple cuts in the luciferase gene, including one within the luciferase PCR amplicon specified by the primers used for amplification. RsaI was deactivated before continuing with DNase I treatment. With this additional step, the average CT value for luciferase from RT product was 20.2 ± 0.6 cycles compared with the average CT value of 27.9 ± 0.6 cycles from RNA sample (without RT). The luciferase CT value from contaminating plasmid DNA were sufficiently shifted out of the range relevant for RNA analysis (23Winer J. Jung C.K. Shackel I. Williams P.M. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 a, 300 μm Deta/NO caused a 25% decrease in steady-state luciferase mRNA expression as measured by comparison with real-time PCR products in cells not exposed to the NO donor. Our next step was to examine whether the decrease in luciferase mRNA was caused by changes in message stability. Cells transfected with pGL3-MCSF-Luc construct were treated for 2 h with the NO donor SNP (300 μm). At this point, actinomycin D was added at levels shown to inhibit further mRNA transcription. In ST-2 cells, the control luciferase mRNA had a very short half-life of about 75 min. In those cells treated with SNP, the half-life was decreased to 45 min, a significant decrease seen in two repeats of this experiment (Fig. 5 b). Thus, the substantial decreases in luciferase activity caused by NO donors are reflected in the nearly 50% decrease in the stability of luciferase mRNA. In contrast, luciferase mRNA half-life was longer (∼220 min) in ST-2 cells transfected with pGL3-Control, in which the SV40 enhancer was placed downstream of the luciferase coding region and poly(A) (Fig. 5 c). Comparing luciferase mRNA half-life between control and NO treatments, there was a slight decrease to ∼200 min in the presence of 300 μm SNP. As another control, CAT mRNA levels were also measured to evaluate whether NO donors affected this message. ST-2 cells were transfected with pCAT-MCSF and total RNA collected after treatment with Deta/NO (300 μm) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 5 d, CAT mRNA expression, measured by real-time PCR, was not changed in the presence of the NO donor. HepG2, a hepatocyte carcinoma cell line was used to evaluate whether the NO donor repression of luciferase was restricted to the ST-2 bone stromal cell line. The constructs pGL3-SV40 (SV40Enhancer)-Luc and pGL3-MCSF (SV40Enhancer)-Luc were transfected into HepG2 cells. The cells were then treated with NOR4 (0–300 μm) as was done previously in the ST-2 cell line. As shown in Fig. 6 a, high dose of NOR4 (300 μm) decreased luciferase activity of the pGL3-SV40 (SV40Enhancer)-Luc as shown previously. The effect of the MCSF or SV40 promoter without the enhancer showed that SNP repressed activity at less than 300 μm (Fig. 6 b). Nitric oxide has been shown to modulate the gene expression of many proteins through cGMP and cGMP independent pathways as well as altering DNA binding capabilities of transcription factors throughS-nitrosylation (1Lane P. Gross S.S. Semin. Nephrol. 1999; 19: 215-229PubMed Google Scholar, 24Marshall H.E. Merchant K. Stamler J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Besides genes that seem to be up-regulated, such as ecSOD (9Fukai T. Siegfried M.R. Ushio-Fukai M. Cheng Y. Kojda G. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1631-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there are many genes whose expression is inhibited after treatment with nitric oxide (e.g. IGFBP-1 (6Sugawara J. Suh D.S. Faessen G.H. Suen L.F. Shibata T. Kaper F. Giaccia A.J. Giudice L.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 2714-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα (3Sellak H. Yang X. Cao X. Cornwell T. Soff G.A. Lincoln T. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4 (25Hara H. Adachi T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). Identification of the mechanism of gene repression often involves assessing the specific promoter activity in the presence of an NO donor. The luciferase gene is widely used in constructs employed to study promoter and enhancer control of gene expression because luciferase measurement is sensitive and responds quickly to changes in promoter activity (13de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar,14Williams T. Burlein J. Ogden S. Krika L. Kant J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 26-32Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Numerous citations suggest that nitric oxide, and NO donors, strongly and dose-dependently inhibit promoters assayed with a luciferase reporter. For instance, when NO donors were shown to decrease vitamin D receptor-retinoid X receptor-VDRE complex formation, the next study was to assay a VDRE fused to minimal thymidine kinase promoter with a luciferase reporter: Deta/NO was shown to decrease luciferase activity by 50% at 300 μm (7Kroncke K.D. Carlberg C. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A repressive effect of NO on vitamin D stimulation of theCYP3A4 gene was also suggested to rely on a transcriptional effect of NO; the authors showed that the NO donor NOR4 dose dependently decreased the CYP3A4 promoter linked to a luciferase reporter with an ED50 of around 300 μm (5Hara H. Mitani N. Adachi T. Free Radic. Res. 2000; 33: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,25Hara H. Adachi T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similarly, the expression of endogenous cGMP-dependent protein kinase Iα shown to be sensitive to NO, was studied with a PKG-Iα promoter/luciferase construct, revealing a dose-dependent inhibition of luciferase activity after treatment with three structurally unrelated NO donors (3Sellak H. Yang X. Cao X. Cornwell T. Soff G.A. Lincoln T. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this case, the activity of IGFBP-1 promoter/luciferase deletion constructs was shown to be down-regulated by Deta/NO; although NO stimulated cGMP, inhibitors of cGMP failed to block NO associated gene repression, leading the authors to conclude that NO had an inhibitory effect separate from cGMP (3Sellak H. Yang X. Cao X. Cornwell T. Soff G.A. Lincoln T. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Reports such as these led to an examination of NO involvement in gene repression in our laboratory. Consideration of multiple promoter constructs in our laboratory showed many to be sensitive to NO donor inhibition, leading us to examine the generality of NO promoter repression. To assess NO effect on the promoter-luciferase assay, we studied both weak and strong promoters and those with an SV40 enhancer used to increase sensitivity. As shown in Fig. 1, all the luciferase reporter constructs we studied had decreased luciferase activity in the presence of NO donors (including SNP, Deta/NO, and NOR4). Those lacking the SV40 enhancer, perhaps the most common type of construct used to study promoter activity, were all inhibited by NO donors with apparent 50% inhibition at ∼300 μm. Similar results are presented for other promoters studied with luciferase in the literature as cited above. One group did show increased repression of the CYP2D6 promoter compared with a control luciferase, in that case pGL3-control; however, it seems that the control reporter contained the SV40 enhancer, whereas their specific promoter did not (25Hara H. Adachi T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our results show that constructs containing the SV40 enhancer are less sensitive to the repressive effect of the NO donor. Inclusion of the SV40 enhancer conveyed resistance to suppression of luciferase activity until 300 μm (Fig. 2). Many firefly luciferase vectors are marketed; for instance Promega's pGL3-control and the pGL3-enhancer contain the SV40 enhancer, whereas the pGL3-basic and the pGL3-promoter do not. Consideration of the SV40 enhancer region as a stabilizer that is, perhaps, not sensitive to NO effects suggests that construct design is important for analysis of NO effect: Sugawara inserted the insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 promoter into pGL3 promoter vector (6Sugawara J. Suh D.S. Faessen G.H. Suen L.F. Shibata T. Kaper F. Giaccia A.J. Giudice L.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 2714-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); Hara and Sellak used the pGL3-basic construct (3Sellak H. Yang X. Cao X. Cornwell T. Soff G.A. Lincoln T. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,25Hara H. Adachi T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 61: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In those constructs derived from pGL3-Basic 100 μmof SNP, Deta/NO, or NOR4 was sufficient to decrease luciferase activity. One example from the literature was careful to show a control luciferase construct that seems to be resistant to NO repression. In this article by Sogawa et al., NO donors inhibited the luciferase expression driven by a promoter containing four hypoxia-response element (HRE3) sequences upstream of an SV40 promoter, as well as one HRE sequence set before a VEGF promoter (26Sogawa K. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Ema M. Abe M. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7368-7373Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The inhibition of these HRE-containing sequences was highly significant at low doses of SNP, with an ED50 under 10 μm. The control luciferase reporter vector, also preceded by a SV40 promoter, was not inhibited by the NO donors—however, the luciferase construct did differ from those containing HRE by the inclusion of an SV40 enhancer downstream of luciferase coding frame and the poly(A) signal (26Sogawa K. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Ema M. Abe M. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7368-7373Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Despite this, it is likely that this extremely sensitive repression is markedly different that the promoter responses we have studied in this work. We ruled out that NO donors caused a generalized decrease in gene transcription by using two of the previously NO “inhibited” promoters linked to non-luciferase-based reporters. We had previously tried to use the β-galactosidase reporter, but this was also significantly inhibited by Deta/NO in a dose-response manner in ST-2 cells in multiple promoter constructs (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 3, NO failed to inhibit CAT expression driven by a viral or eukaryotic promoter that was significantly “inhibited” by NO donors in luciferase assay. The CAT assay results revealed that neither the MCSF nor CMV promoter sequence was responsible for the NO-inhibition of luciferase activity. Thus, proper control constructs were able to prevent misconceptions. Because NO did not affect promoters in CAT reporter constructs and had no direct effect on the luciferase assay, we considered whether NO's effect on the luciferase activity might be through effects on altered stability of the luciferase mRNA. After eliminating contaminating reporter plasmid DNA with a two-step procedure involving a restriction endonuclease cut followed by DNase I digestion, we found the luciferase mRNA half-life to be in the range of 75 min. This was in agreement with results from Xu et al. (27Xu K. Robida A.M. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23012-23019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), who studied luciferase after retroviral integration of the luciferase message finding a half-life of 65 min. Our work confirms that luciferase mRNA has a short half-life in the ST-2 cells, and that this half-life is further decreased by exogenous nitric oxide. However, luciferase mRNA half-life was increased to 220 min in constructs containing the SV40 enhancer (Fig. 5 c). In contrast, Cok and Morrison's study (18Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) showed a message half-life of longer than 10 h from vector containing the SV40 enhancer region—indeed, essentially no mRNA was degraded during the 10 h of the study (18Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23179-23185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is not entirely clear whether luciferase mRNA stability is completely embedded in the SV40 enhancer region. A Rous sarcoma virus-driven luciferase transfected into breast cancer cells that does not have a SV40 enhancer seemed be resistant to degradation after 12 h of actinomycin D treatment (28Balmer L.A. Beveridge D.J. Jazayeri J.A. Thomson A.M. Walker C.E. Leedman P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2070-2084Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, no mention was made of controlling for plasmid DNA contamination. The SV40 enhancer region was initially inserted into the luciferase reporter vectors to improve the sensitivity of the luciferase signal, giving an increase of nearly 10-fold luciferase activity (13de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). This increased sensitivity has been though to be caused by increased transport into the nucleus (29Dean D.A. Dean B.S. Muller S. Smith L.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) or perhaps by inhibition of gene silencing via methylation (30Hertz J.M. Schell G. Doerfler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24232-24240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In sum, nitric oxide is known to have widespread effects on gene expression in almost every cell studied. The mechanisms involved in the regulation of NO are complex and involve multiple effects through variable signal cascades and alteration of protein nitrosylation and oxidation. Our work reveals that NO also affects stability of mRNA, particularly luciferase mRNA. Because luciferase seems to be a fairly unstable transcript, as shown by a half-life of significantly less than 80 min, it may be particularly susceptible to regulation through altering message stability. Our results indicate that luciferase reporter may not be a good choice for studying the activity of promoters that seem to be regulated by nitric oxide. At the very least, adequate controls, and appreciation of specifics of reporter elements such as inclusion of activity enhancing sequences, are necessary for any conclusion regarding significant effects of nitric oxide."

In this study cysteine substitution mutagenesis was used to define the cytoplasmic ends of the first three transmembrane spans of subunit a, as judged by accessibility to 3-N-maleimidyl-propionyl biocytin. The cytoplasmic end of the fourth transmembrane span could not be defined in this way because of the limited extent of labeling of all residues between 186 and 206. In contrast, most of the preceding residues in that region, closer to transmembrane span 3, were labeled readily. The proximity of this region to other subunits in Fo was tested by reacting mono-cysteine mutants with a photoactivated cross-linker. Residues 165, 169, 173, 174, 177, 178, and 182–184 could all be cross-linked to subunit c, but no sites were cross-linked to b subunits. Attempts using double mutants of subunita to generate simultaneous cross-links to two differentc subunits were unsuccessful. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane spans 3 and 4 of subunita is in close proximity to at least one csubunit.

It is composed of two subcomplexes: an F1 sector with subunits that contain the catalytic sites and a membrane-bound Fosector with subunits that conduct protons across the membrane. In theE. coli enzyme five different subunits are found in F1: α, ॆ, γ, δ, and ε with a stoichiometry of 3:3:1:1:1.

Evidence for rotation of subunits through 360 degrees in response to ATP hydrolysis has been provided by direct observation of fluorescently labeled actin filaments attached to γ or ε (3Noji H.

Subunits that make up the stator include δ,a, and b in addition to α and ॆ, which house the catalytic sites. The mechanism by which the proton motive force across the membrane drives rotation of the c oligomer of Fo along with subunits γ and ε is not known. High resolution structures of F1, primarily from bovine mitochondria, have provided details about the catalytic sites and their conformational changes (13Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Google Scholar, 14Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Google Scholar, 15Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Google Scholar), but less is known about the structure of the Fo subunits. Subunit b is thought to be embedded in the membrane via a hydrophobic region near its N terminus. Studies of an amino-terminal fragment of subunit b using NMR and detection of disulfide formation have shown it to be α-helical and dimeric (16Dmitriev O. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15598-15604Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that a truncated, soluble form of b is extended and dimeric (17Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Google Scholar, 18McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21233-21239Google Scholar, 19Sorgen P.L. Bubb M.R. McCormick K.A. Edison A.S. Cain B.D.

Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1227-1238Google Scholar). The amino terminus of subunit b is thought to interact with subunit a, and its carboxyl terminus is thought to interact with δ (22Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Google Scholar). Subunit c is a hydrophobic protein with a conserved aspartic or glutamic acid that is thought to participate in proton translocation steps. NMR studies of the monomeric c subunit have shown it to be an α-helical hairpin with two transmembrane spans connected by a short polar loop (23Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12167-12177Google Scholar, 24Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 665-674Google Scholar, 25Girvin M.E. Rastogi V.K. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8817-8824Google Scholar), with the conserved Asp-61 residue near the center of the second helix. The conformation of subunitc appears to be pH-dependent, as indicated by NMR studies (26Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Google Scholar). The number of c subunits that make up the oligomer in Fo from E. coli is still uncertain but is likely to be 10 (27Jiang W. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4966-4971Google Scholar). Subunit a has been analyzed by surface labeling of unique, engineered cysteine residues. Such studies have established the number of transmembrane spans (28Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Google Scholar, 29Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Google Scholar, 30Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Google Scholar) and have characterized the first cytoplasmic loop (31Long J.C. DeLeon-Rangel J. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27288-27293Google Scholar) and the first periplasmic loop (32Zhang D. Vik S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 331-337Google Scholar). These results are summarized in Fig. 1, in which five transmembrane spans are shown. The first cytoplasmic loop is drawn to reflect the limited accessibility of its central region to the reagent MPB.1 Residues important for function (33Lightowlers R.N. Howitt S.M. Hatch L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 399-406Google Scholar, 34Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6606-6612Google Scholar, 35Lightowlers R.N. Howitt S.M. Hatch L. Gibson F. Cox G.

Chem. 1989; 264: 3292-3300Google Scholar) have been shown to reside in transmembrane spans 4 (Arg-210 and Glu-219) and 5 (His-245). In addition, Glu-196, appears to reside in the cytoplasmic loop preceding transmembrane span 4. It is likely that Arg-210 of subunit ainteracts with the essential residue Asp-61 of subunit cduring coupled proton translocation since disulfide cross-linking studies have shown that transmembrane span 4 of subunit a, between residues 207 and 225, appears to be in contact with subunitc (37Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Google Scholar). The mechanism by which subunit a contributes to the proton conducting path of the ATP synthase is not clear, but it is likely to play such a role. Models have been presented in which subunita contributes amino acids that make up two half-channels, one opening to the periplasm and one to the cytoplasm, that allow access to the proton binding site on subunit c (38Engelbrecht S. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 485-491Google Scholar, 39Vik S.B. Patterson A.R. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16229-16234Google Scholar). Previously identified residues in subunit a (33Lightowlers R.N. Howitt S.M. Hatch L. Gibson F. Cox G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 399-406Google Scholar, 34Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 3292-3300Google Scholar), thought to be important in proton access to subunit c, are found within transmembrane spans, near the periplasmic surface (32Zhang D. Vik S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 331-337Google Scholar). So far, it is not clear how proton access might be controlled at the cytoplasmic surface. These studies were undertaken to examine the structure of the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane spans 3 and 4 and to determine which other Fo subunits those residues were near. Restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon Technologies. DNA sequencing was done by Lone Star Labs. MPB and TFPAM-3 were obtained from Molecular Probes. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin and DNA miniprep kits were obtained from Qiagen. Mouse anti-HA antibody was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Goat anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, goat anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, avidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoylphosphate p-toluidine salt,p-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride, SDS-PAGE, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and low and broad range protein molecular weight standards were obtained from Bio-Rad.N-Octyl-ॆ-d-glucoside was purchased from Anatrace. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. The UV lamp was purchased from UVP, model UVL-56, with a wavelength of 365 nm. Anti-b antibodies and anti-c antibodies were gifts of Dr. R. Capaldi, University of Oregon and Dr. K. Altendorf, University of Osnabrück, Osnabrück, Germany, respectively. The plasmids, pLN6HisHA (28Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Google Scholar), pLN7HisHA (31Long J.C. DeLeon-Rangel J. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27288-27293Google Scholar), pLN46HisHA (32Zhang D. Vik S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 331-337Google Scholar), pTW1HisHA (28Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Google Scholar), pARP2HisHA (39Vik S.B. Patterson A.R. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16229-16234Google Scholar), and pDP1018HisHA were used for the construction of mutants. Plasmid pDP1018HisHA was constructed by ligation of the 770-base pair BsaHI-AflIII fragment from pBJA1018 (39Vik S.B. Patterson A.R. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16229-16234Google Scholar) and the 2592-base pair BsaHI-AflIII fragment from pLN7HisHA. These plasmids produce subunit a that includes an HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA), derived from the hemagglutinin protein of human influenza virus, and a His6 tag at the carboxyl terminus of the protein. These tags have no effect on function. These plasmids differ primarily in the placement of unique restriction sites that are necessary for cassette mutagenesis. Mutagenesis and growth of cultures were carried out as described previously (32Zhang D. Vik S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 331-337Google Scholar). Inside-out membrane vesicles were made from a 250-ml culture (per experimental sample) in LB medium grown to A600 = 1.0. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgSO4, pH 7.5, and passed through a French press at 14,000 p.s.i. Cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by a low speed spin at 8000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman Ti-70 rotor. The pellet was resuspended and used in the experiments or stored at −80 °C. The inside-out membrane vesicles were labeled in 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), with 120 ॖm MPB at room temperature for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding ॆ–mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 20 mm. The vesicles were then centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 45 min, and subunit a was purified by Ni-NTA resin as described below. This cross-linker is expected to span 10–15 Å. The cross-linking was carried out by the methods described previously (31Long J.C. DeLeon-Rangel J. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27288-27293Google Scholar). The membrane vesicles were suspended in 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mm EDTA, and 107 glycerol. It was incubated with 200 ॖm TFPAM-3 for 60 min at room temperature, and the reaction was terminated by addition of 15 mm cysteine. After addition of 5 mm ATP, cross-linking was activated by UV light. The reactions were terminated after 2 h at room temperature. After reaction, membrane vesicles were resuspended in extraction buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.57 octyl glucoside, 0.17 deoxycholate, 0.57 cholate, 10 mmॆ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, and 17 Tween 20). Subunit a was purified using Ni-NTA as described previously (32Zhang D. Vik S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 331-337Google Scholar). Samples of purified subunit a were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described previously (31Long J.C. DeLeon-Rangel J. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27288-27293Google Scholar). For detection of subunit a, previously published procedures were followed (29Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Google Scholar). For detection of subunit b, the blocked membrane was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with b antibody at a dilution of 1:1000. After washing three times with TBS/Tween 20, it was incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h. After another three washings with TBS/Tween 20, color was developed as described above. For detection of subunitc, the blocked membrane was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with c antibody at a dilution of 1:5000. After washing three times with TBS/Tween 20, it was incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate at a dilution of 1:1000 for 1 h. After another three washings with TBS/Tween 20, color was developed. The molecular models shown were created from the Protein Data Bank file 1c99, model 1, using RasMol (40Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Google Scholar). A series of 46 monosubstituted cysteine mutants of subunita that are thought to be near the cytoplasmic surface were constructed. All mutants grew in succinate minimal medium, indicating the ability to carry out oxidative phosphorylation. Inverted inner membrane vesicles were prepared from these mutants and were then labeled with MPB to test the surface accessibility of each residue. The results for mutations between residues 167 and 174 are shown in Fig.2, and the results for mutations between residues 177 and 184 are shown in Fig. 3. The results of all mutants are summarized in TableI. For comparative purposes, each labeling experiment contained G70C, a residue shown previously (29Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Google Scholar) to label strongly in membrane vesicles, i.e. from the cytoplasmic surface, and E131C, a residue that was shown to label poorly in membrane vesicles (28Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Google Scholar) but strongly from the periplasmic surface (29Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Google Scholar). In Fig. 2A, the results of MPB labeling in membrane vesicles followed by Ni-NTA purification of subunita are shown. In B an immunoblot of the corresponding samples is shown to confirm that the level of protein is similar.Figure 3Labeling of subunit a from the cytoplasmic surface: residues 177, 178, 179, 182, 183, and 184.

Open table in a new tab In Fig. 2, the results of labeling of residues K167C, M168C, K169C, G170C, I171C, G173C, and F174C are shown. Only K167C,lane 4, shows no sign of labeling, while F174C, lane 10, labels as well as G70C, lane 2. Other residues show intermediate levels of labeling. In Fig. 3 the results of labeling of residues E177C, L178C, T179C, P182C, F183C, and N184C are shown. All of the residues label to an intermediate degree except T179C, which is near the background level. The results of H185C, W186C, A187C, F188C, I189C, V191C, and N192C are shown in Table I. None of them show significant labeling, expect for H185C and W186C. Other residues between 193 and 206 show only a trace of labeling, at most. Residues Phe-60, Arg-61, Val-63, and Ala-64 near the end of transmembrane span 1 were analyzed, and the results are presented in Table I. In this group, only A64C, lane 7, is labeled significantly when compared with the controls, G70C and E131C. The results of labeling I101C, A102C, and P103C, three residues near the cytoplasmic end of transmembrane span 2, are shown in Table I. Only I101C is labeled above a background level. The results of labeling residues near the cytoplasmic surface of transmembrane span 3, L160C, I161C, L162C, F163C, Y164C, and S165C, are also presented in Table I. None of these residues were labeled to a significant extent. A series of cross-linking experiments was conducted to determine if any of the residues in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane spans 3 and 4 are near subunits bor c. Monosubstituted cysteine mutants at the following positions were reacted with the photoactivated cross-linker TFPAM-3: 165, 167–171, 173–175, 177–179, and 182–184. After UV activation, nine residues showed evidence of cross-linking to subunit c, and the results are presented in Fig. 4. In A, samples S165C, K169C, G173C, and F174C are probed with anti-HA for detection of subunit a, on the left side, and the same samples are probed with anti-cantibodies on the right side. The a-c cross-link can be seen in both blots and is dependent upon UV activation, designated by the 舠+舡 sign. Similarly, as shown in B, samples E177C, L178C, P182C, and F183C are probed with anti-HA for detection of subunit a on the left side and with anti-c antibodies on the right side. Residue N184C was also found to cross-link to subunit c in a similar manner (results not shown). The following double cysteine mutants were constructed and tested for cross-linking using TFPAM-3: S165C/ P182C, K169C/P182C, G173C/P182C, F174C/P182C, E177C/P182C, L178C/P182C, S165C/F183C, K169C/F183C, G173C/F183C, F174C/F183C, E177C/F183C, L178C/F183C, S165C/N184C, K169C/N184C, G173C/N184C, F174C/N184C, E177C/N184C, and L178C/N184C. In each case only a single cross-linked product was seen with no indication of an a-c2 product (results not shown). The labeling results presented here provide further information about the junctions of the first three transmembrane spans of subunita, and this information is summarized in Fig.5. This model differs from that shown in Fig. 1 in two respects. The junctions of the transmembrane spans at the cytoplasmic surfaces have been adjusted to reflect the results of labeling, and the periplasmic loop between spans 4 and 5 has been adjusted, as discussed below. Previous work (29Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Google Scholar) had identified residue T37C, at the amino-terminal end of transmembrane span 1, as accessible by MPB labeling, but residues W39C and D44C were not. At the carboxyl-terminal end of transmembrane span 1, residues 67–70 labeled strongly, while residue 64 labeled weakly (29Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Google Scholar). In this work, residues F60C, R61C, and V63C were shown not to label, relative to the weak labeling of residue A64C. The results indicate a core transmembrane segment of ∼26 residues from 38 to 63. This matches well the calculated hydropathy peak centered near residues 50–53 (41Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3095-3099Google Scholar, 42Vik S.B. Dao N.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 199-207Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal end of transmembrane span 2 was analyzed in previous work (32Zhang D. Vik S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 331-337Google Scholar). Residues D119C, L120C, and P122C were inaccessible to MPB labeling, while residues D124C and P127C were labeled. Near the amino-terminal end of transmembrane span 2, residues 92–98 were all labeled by MPB (31Long J.C. DeLeon-Rangel J. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27288-27293Google Scholar). Here it was shown that residue I101C was labeled to a small degree relative to residues A102C and P103C. These results indicate a core transmembrane segment of ∼22 residues from 102 to 123, which again matches closely the calculated hydropathy peak centered near residues 109–111 (41Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3095-3099Google Scholar, 42Vik S.B. Dao N.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 199-207Google Scholar). The amino-terminal end of transmembrane span 3 was analyzed in previous work (32Zhang D. Vik S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 331-337Google Scholar), and residues V142C, S144C, and D146C were all shown to be labeled with MPB. At the carboxyl-terminal end of transmembrane span 3 residue K169C was shown to be labeled with fluorescein-maleimide (30Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Google Scholar) and G172C was shown to be labeled with MPB (28Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Google Scholar). Here, residues 160–165 and K167C were shown to be inaccessible to MPB, while M168C was labeled. Therefore, a core transmembrane segment of ∼21 residues exists from 147 to 167, which again matches well the calculated hydropathy peak centered near residues 156–158 (41Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3095-3099Google Scholar, 42Vik S.B. Dao N.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 199-207Google Scholar). In contrast, the results presented here give no indication of the amino-terminal end of transmembrane span 4. Previous studies had indicated that residue E196C could be labeled from the cytoplasmic surface, but those results occurred under slightly more strenuous labeling conditions (30Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Google Scholar), or the labeling was rather weak (28Long J.C. Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16235-16240Google Scholar). In this study the labeling of all residues tested between 185 and 206 was seen to be very weak, and only a few showed a level of labeling that could be considered above background. While it is likely that absolute levels of labeling would differ under different conditions and with different maleimido-reagents, the lack of relative differences seen here makes it impossible to recognize the junction of transmembrane span 4 with the cytoplasmic surface. This also applies to the periplasmic ends of both transmembrane spans 4 and 5, where only three residues were found to be labeled by MPB (29Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Google Scholar). In studies of lac permease, single amino acid insertions (43Braun P. Persson B. Kaback H.R. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29566-29571Google Scholar) or deletions (44Wolin C.D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8590-8597Google Scholar, 45Wolin C.D. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1996-2003Google Scholar) have been used as indicators of the ends of transmembrane spans. In previous work reported by this laboratory (39Vik S.B. Patterson A.R. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16229-16234Google Scholar, 41Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3095-3099Google Scholar), insertions of alanine after residues 202 and 225 did not seriously impair function of the ATP synthase, while those after positions 212, 217, and 222 did. These results are consistent with a hydrophobic core segment in transmembrane span 4 approximately between residues 202–225. Likewise, consideration of insertions of alanine (39Vik S.B. Patterson A.R. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16229-16234Google Scholar) and MPB labeling (29Wada T. Long J.C. Zhang D. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17353-17357Google Scholar) identifies a core segment in transmembrane span 5 between residues 238 and 259. The loop now identified between residues 226 and 236 is consistent with the marginal effects of alanine insertions after residues 225, 229, and 233. This is in contrast to the loss of function seen with insertions after residues 217, 222, 238 and 243 (37Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Google Scholar, 39Vik S.B. Patterson A.R. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16229-16234Google Scholar). The labeling of the residues in the putative loop between transmembrane spans 3 and 4 showed a strikingly asymmetric pattern. Twelve of thirteen residues tested between 168 and 184 were found to be labeled by MPB, while none of the 20 residues tested between 185 and 206 showed significant labeling. In consideration of the bulky nature of the reagent MPB, it is likely that the amino-terminal half of this loop is highly exposed, given the extensive labeling pattern. The lack of labeling at the carboxyl-terminal end of the loop is consistent with significant protein-protein interactions. This asymmetry correlates with amino acid sequence conservation, in which conservation for residues 190–225 in subunit a is high (46Vik S.B. Lee D. Curtis C.E. Nguyen L.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 282: 125-131Google Scholar), while for residues prior to 190 conservation is low. Evidence for a surface of interaction between transmembrane span 4 of subunit a and the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane span of subunit c has been provided by studies of engineered disulfides by Jiang and Fillingame (37Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6607-6612Google Scholar). In the structural model of subunit c (26Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Google Scholar) determined at pH 8, shown in Fig. 6, these residues form a curved surface, suggesting that transmembrane span 4 of subunit a wraps around that surface. If Glu-196 of subunit a were part of an α-helical extension of transmembrane span 4 then it would be found near the loop of subunitc (residues 41–43) since L207C of subunit aforms a disulfide with I55C of subunit c and residues 43–55 in subunit c are all α-helical in the structural model at pH 8. This possibility is illustrated in Fig. 6 in which residues 190–225 of subunit a are modeled as an α-helix. The labeling pattern of residues 168–184 is consistent with a connection from transmembrane span 3 to the top of a ring ofc subunits with high surface accessibility. The accessibility of these residues to MPB resembles that of the residues near the cytoplasmic surface of transmembrane spans 1 and 2 of subunita. The results of cross-linking with TFPAM-3 indicate that this region is near subunit c, i.e. at a distance of 10–15 Å. The range of sites that can be cross-linked indicates that both the end of transmembrane span 3 and the center of the second cytoplasmic loop are near subunit c. It is likely that the efficiency of cross-linking was too low to detect a doubly cross-linked product. Therefore, it remains uncertain if all positions cross-link to the same subunit c. Although this loop is not predicted to be entirely α-helical (42Vik S.B. Dao N.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 199-207Google Scholar), the pattern of labeling and cross-linking from residues 173–179 (GFTKELT) is consistent with an α-helix. The proposed interactions between subunit a and subunitc discussed above have important implications for the mechanism of proton translocation of which several proposals have been described recently (26Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Google Scholar, 47Dmitriev O.Y. Abildgaard F. Markley J.L. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5537-5547Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6,a-Arg-210 (blue) would be near thec-Asp-61 (red). That would placea-Glu-219 pointing into the bundle of transmembrane spans of subunit a (30Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16241-16247Google Scholar) and a-Glu-196 at the top near the loop of subunit c. The residues in subunit a that cross-link to subunit c are likely to be near the adjacent subunit c in the ring. It has been proposed that the proton motive force causes protonation of a network of residues in subunita near the periplasmic surface (32Zhang D. Vik S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 331-337Google Scholar), includinga-Glu-219 and a-His-245. This could cause a twisting or bending of transmembrane span 4 of subunit aallowing protonation of c-Asp-61 from the periplasmic side. This would cause a-Arg-210 to move away fromc-Asp-61, as subunit c changes to its protonated conformation (26Rastogi V.K. Girvin M.E. Nature. 1999; 402: 263-268Google Scholar) and the c-Asp-61 rotates to its new position. The conformational changes in the transmembrane span 4 of subunit a and in the loop region of subunit c, would be transmitted to the Glu-196 region of subunit a. This could promote the deprotonation of c-Asp-61 of the adjacent subunit c, perhaps by the exposure ofa-Glu-196 and the introduction of water. At this point, thea-Arg-210 would now be in position to be attracted electrostatically to c-Asp-61, but since it would be to the adjacent subunit c, one step of rotation will have occurred.

Type IB topoisomerases modulate the topological state of DNA by cleaving and rejoining one strand of the DNA duplex. Cleavage is a transesterification reaction in which the scissile phosphodiester is attacked by a tyrosine of the enzyme, resulting in the formation of a DNA-(3′-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate and the expulsion of a 5′-OH DNA strand. In the religation step, the DNA 5′-OH group attacks the covalent intermediate resulting in expulsion of the active site tyrosine and restoration of the DNA phosphodiester backbone. Vaccinia topoisomerase is a prototype of the type IB topoisomerase family, which includes eukaryotic nuclear and mitochondrial topoisomerase IB, the poxvirus topoisomerases, and poxvirus-like topoisomerases encoded by bacteria (1Shuman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 321-337Google Scholar, 2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Google Scholar, 3Zhang H. Barcelo J.M. Lee B. Kohlhagen G. Zimonjic D.B. Popescu N.C. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10608-10613Google Scholar, 4Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1853-1858Google Scholar). The vaccinia enzyme is distinguished from the nuclear topoisomerase I by its compact size (314 amino acids) and its site specificity in DNA transesterification (5Shuman S. Prescott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17826-17836Google Scholar). Vaccinia topoisomerase binds and cleaves duplex DNA at a pentapyrimidine target sequence 5′-(T/C)CCTTp↓. The Tp↓ nucleotide (defined as the +1 nucleotide) is linked to Tyr-274 of the enzyme. The DNA features that contribute to target site recognition and catalysis have been examined using synthetic substrates containing a single CCCTT site. The DNase I footprint of vaccinia topoisomerase covers ∼13 nucleotides upstream (5′) and ∼9–13 nucleotides downstream (3′) of the scissile bond (6Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11372-11379Google Scholar). Exonuclease III footprinting suggests a two-part interaction of topoisomerase with the DNA 5′ of the site of covalent adduct formation (7Cheng C. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16599-16612Google Scholar). A transient margin of protection from exonuclease III digestion, which extends to positions +13 to +14 on the scissile strand, gives way to a long-lived margin of protection at positions +7 to +9. The tightly protected segment includes the entire CCCTT↓ element that directs site-specific transesterification. Modification interference, modification protection, analog substitution, and UV cross-linking experiments indicate that vaccinia topoisomerase makes contact with several nucleotide bases and the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA in the vicinity of the CCCTT recognition site. For example, dimethyl sulfate protection and interference experiments revealed interactions in the major groove with the three guanine bases of the pentamer motif complementary strand (3′-GGGAA) (8Shuman S. Turner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18943-18950Google Scholar). The contributions of individual phosphates to binding specificity were initially inferred from the effects of phosphate ethylation on protein binding (9Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31731-31734Google Scholar). Ethylation of four phosphates on the scissile strand (positions CpCpCpTpTp↓ within the pentamer motif) and three phosphates on the nonscissile strand (3′-GpGpGpApA) interfered with topoisomerase-DNA complex formation. In a B-form structure of the CCCTT-containing DNA substrate, the relevant topoisomerase-phosphate contacts are arrayed across the minor groove of the double helix (9Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31731-31734Google Scholar). The major groove base-specific contacts that comprise the topoisomerase-DNA interface are situated on the opposite face of the DNA helix from the specific phosphate contacts and from the scissile phosphate. These results suggested that topoisomerase binds circumferentially to its target site in duplex DNA (9Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31731-31734Google Scholar). Subsequent structural analyses of the human and vaccinia topoisomerases revealed that the type IB enzymes do indeed form a C-shaped protein clamp around the DNA duplex (10Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Google Scholar, 11Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Google Scholar). The carboxyl catalytic domain interacts with the minor groove face of the DNA at the cleavage site, while the amino domain is positioned on the major groove side of the target site. The crystal structures, together with functional studies of the vaccinia enzyme (12Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1035-1041Google Scholar, 13Krogh B.O. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5711-5714Google Scholar), imply that several of the catalytic amino acids either coordinate the scissile phosphodiester from the minor groove side or penetrate directly into the minor groove. In the present study, we use a minor groove-specific interference approach to delineate the dimensions of the minor groove interface between vaccinia topoisomerase and its cleavage site. We introduce 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide adducts of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) 1The abbreviations used are: BP, benzo[a]pyrene; dG, deoxyguanosine 1The abbreviations used are: BP, benzo[a]pyrene; dG, deoxyguanosine at the exocyclicN 2-amino group of single deoxyguanosine (dG) positions within the nonscissile strand of a suicide cleavage substrate for vaccinia topoisomerase. These adducts are derived from trans opening with inversion at C-10 of the (+)-(7R,8S,9S,10R)- and (−)-(7S,8R,9R,10S)- enantiomers of the diol epoxides in which the benzylic 7-hydroxyl group and the epoxide oxygen are trans (see Fig. 1). NMR structures have established that these BPdG adducts fit into the minor groove with no significant perturbations of Watson-Crick base pairing or B-form helix conformation (14Geacintov N.E. Cosman M. Hingerty B.E. Amin S. Broyde S. Patel D.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 111-146Google Scholar, 33Cosman M. de los Santos C. Fiala R. Hingerty B.E. Ibanez V. Margulis L.A. Live D.

Broyde S. Patel D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5245-5252Google Scholar). Moreover, the S and Radducts have opposite orientations in the minor groove, such that theS adduct points toward the 5′ end of the modified strand, whereas the R adduct points toward the 3′ end of the modified strand (see Fig. 1). Thus, trans opened BPdG adducts provide an elegant means to gauge the effects of space occupancy within the minor groove. This technique has been applied previously to human topoisomerase IB, whereby a BPdG adduct was placed on the scissile strand at the nucleoside immediately 3′ of the phosphodiester that is preferentially cleaved by the human enzyme in unmodified DNA (15Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Pourquier P. Sayer J.M. Kroth H. Jerina D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2040-2045Google Scholar, 16Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Laco G.S. Kroth H. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13666-13672Google Scholar). The BPdG adduct suppressed cleavage at the normal site but promoted alternative cleavages elsewhere on both strands of the DNA substrate. This response to interfering lesions is typical for human topoisomerase I, which lacks stringent sequence specificity for DNA transesterification and simply finds another site when confronted with an impediment (17Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12383-12390Google Scholar). Vaccinia topoisomerase is more amenable to quantitatively informative interference studies because the pre-steady-state kinetic parameters for transesterification are known (18Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Google Scholar, 19Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Google Scholar, 20Stivers J.T. Jagadeesh G.J. Nawrot B. Stec W.J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5561-5572Google Scholar) and the enzyme does not relinquish its site specificity in response to a DNA lesion (21Krogh B.O. Claeboe C.D. Hecht S.M. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20907-20912Google Scholar). Here we introduce BPdG lesions into the G-rich nonscissile strand at the three guanines within the 3′-GGGAA complement of the 5′-CCCTT cleavage site (these are defined as the +5, +4, and +3 G residues) and also at the two nucleosides immediately downstream of the cleavage site (the −1 and −2 nucleosides). We observe a sharp margin of interference effects, whereby +5 and −2 BPdG modifications are well tolerated but +4, +3, and −1 BPdG adducts are severely deleterious. The stereoselective effects at the −1 nucleoside (the Rdiastereomer interferes, whereas the S diastereomer does not) delineate at high resolution the downstream border of the minor groove interface. We also apply the BPdG interference method to probe the interactions ofEscherichia coli exonuclease III with the DNA minor groove. Modified oligonucleotides containing single chiral BPdG adducts (Fig. 1) were synthesized and purified on a 1.5-μmol scale as described previously (35Kroth H. Yagi H. Sayer J.M. Kumar S. Jerina D.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 708-719Google Scholar). The modified dG was introduced by manual coupling using the diastereomeric mixture of suitably protected R andS C-10 adducted phosphoramidates (36Kroth H. Yagi H. Seidel A. Jerina D.M. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 65: 5558-5564Google Scholar). After completion of the synthesis and removal of protecting groups, the resultant diasteromeric oligonucleotides were purified and separated from each other by high performance liquid chromatography (Table I). Absolute configurations of the separated diastereomers were determined from their circular dichroism spectra. The pyrene chromophore produces a positive band in the 320–360-nm range for the R diastereomer and a negative band for the S diastereomer (37Page J.E. Zajc B. Oh-hara T. Lakshman M.K. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M. Dipple A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9127-9137Google Scholar). Unmodified oligonucleotides were purchased from BIOSOURCEInternational. DNA concentrations were determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm. Unmodified 34-mer scissile strands were 5′32P-labeled by enzymatic phosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligonucleotides were gel-purified and hybridized to standard or BPdG-modified 18-mer oligonucleotides at a 1:4 molar ratio of 34-mer to 18-mer. Annealing reaction mixtures containing 0.2 m NaCl and oligonucleotides as specified were heated to 80 °C and then slow-cooled to 22 °C. The hybridized DNAs were stored at 4 °C.

Configurational assignments are based on the long-wavelength (320–360 nm) CD bands of the oligonucleotides, which are positive for R and negative for Sadducts. Recombinant vaccinia topoisomerase was produced in E. coli (BL21) by infection with bacteriophage λCE6 (22Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Google Scholar) and then purified to apparent homogeneity from the soluble bacterial lysate by phosphocellulose and Source S-15 chromatography steps. Protein concentration was determined by using the dye-binding method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol 34-mer/18-mer DNA, and 75 or 150 ng (2 or 4 pmol) of vaccinia topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified and quenched immediately with SDS (1% final concentration). The products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. Free DNA migrated near the dye front. Covalent complex formation was revealed by transfer of radiolabeled DNA to the topoisomerase polypeptide. The extent of covalent complex formation was quantified by scanning the dried gel using a Fujifilm BAS-2500 PhosphorImager. A plot of the percentage of input DNA cleaved versus time established the end point values for cleavage. The data were then normalized to the end point values (defined as 100%), and the cleavage rate constants (k cl) were calculated by fitting the normalized data to the equation 100 − % cleavage(norm) = 100 e−kt. The values of k obs at the saturating level of input topoisomerase (75 ng) and the actual end point cleavage values are listed in Figs. 2 and 5. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of standard or BPdG-modified 34-mer/18-mer DNA, and 75 ng of vaccinia topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C for either 30 s (standard, −2R, −2S, and +5R BPdG), 3 min (+5S and −1S BPdG), 4 h (−1R BPdG), or 24 h (+4R and +4S BPdG). The reactions were quenched with 1% SDS. Half of the sample was digested for 2 h at 37 °C with 10 μg of proteinase K, and the other half was not digested. The mixtures were adjusted to 47% formamide, heat denatured, and analyzed by electrophoreses through a 17% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA). The reaction products were visualized by autoradiographic exposure of the gel. 5′ 32P-labeled BPdG-modified 18-mer oligonucleotides were hybridized to complementary 34-mer DNAs at a 1:4 molar ratio of labeled strand to 34-mer. Exonuclease III reaction mixtures (60 μl) containing 66 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). 0.66 mmMgCl2, 1.8 pmol of 18-mer/34-mer, and 1.0 unit ofE. coli exonuclease III (New England Biolabs) were incubated at 22 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified and quenched by adding EDTA to 30 mm final concentration. The samples were adjusted to 47% formamide, heat denatured, and analyzed by electrophoresis through a 17% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE. The reaction products were visualized by autoradiographic exposure of the gel. A pair of 18-mer strands containing a singleS or R BPdG adduct at position −1 of the nonscissile strand were synthesized and then annealed to 5′32P-labeled 34-mer scissile strands to form “suicide” substrates for vaccinia topoisomerase (Fig. 2 A). Transesterification results in covalent attachment of a 5′32P-labeled 12-mer (5′-pCGTGTCGCCCTTp) to the enzyme via Tyr-274. The unlabeled 22-mer 5′-OH leaving strand dissociates spontaneously from the protein-DNA complex. Loss of the leaving strand drives the reaction toward the covalent state so that the reaction can be treated kinetically as a first-order unidirectional process (18Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Google Scholar, 19Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Google Scholar, 20Stivers J.T. Jagadeesh G.J. Nawrot B. Stec W.J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5561-5572Google Scholar). The reaction of excess topoisomerase with the unmodified control substrate attained an end point at which 87% of the DNA was converted to covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex, and the reaction was complete within 20 s. The extent of transesterification after 5 s was 85% of the end point value. From this datum, we calculated a single-turnover cleavage rate constant (k cl) of 0.4 s−1 (Fig. 2). Introduction of a chiral S BPdG at position −1 had only a modest (4-fold) effect on the cleavage rate constant (k cl = 0.1 s−1) and no effect on the reaction end point (Figs. 2 A and3.). In contrast, the Rdiastereomer at position −1 reduced the rate of transesterification by a factor of 200 (k cl = 0.002 s−1) without influencing the end point (Figs. 2 A and 3). Thek obs for cleavage of either of the −1 BPdG-modified substrates did not increase when the concentration of topoisomerase in the reaction mixture was increased 2-fold (not shown). This indicated that the slowed cleavage rate was not caused by a defect in the initial binding of topoisomerase to the substrate. The results define a stereospecific interference effect at the −1 nucleoside, whereby the R diastereomer elicits 50-fold greater inhibition of transesterification than the S diastereomer. Note that the interfering −1R BPdG adduct is oriented toward the scissile phosphodiester in the minor groove, whereas the non-interfering −1S adduct is pointing away from the cleavage site (Fig. 2 A). To address whether the −1 BPdG substitutions altered the site of cleavage within the 34-mer scissile strand, the reaction products were digested with proteinase K in the presence of SDS to remove the covalently linked topoisomerase. The radiolabeled DNA reaction products were then analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4). Reaction of topoisomerase with the unmodified control substrate resulted in the appearance of a cluster of radiolabeled species migrating faster than the input32P-labeled 34-mer strand (Fig. 4, lane 2). The cluster consists of the 12-mer 5′-pCGTGTCGCCCTTp linked to one or more amino acids of the topoisomerase. Detection of the covalent oligonucleotide-peptide complex was completely dependent on prior digestion of the sample with proteinase K (not shown). This is because the labeled DNA does not migrate into the polyacrylamide gel when it is bound covalently to the topoisomerase polypeptide. The instructive finding was that the same cluster was produced by proteinase K digestion of the covalent complex formed by reaction of topoisomerase with the substrates containing −1R or −1S BPdG adducts on the nonscissile strand (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, the site of covalent complex formation was unchanged by the BPdG modifications. Any shift in the cleavage site, and hence the size of the covalently bound oligonucleotide, would have been readily detected by an altered mobility of the array of labeled oligonucleotide-peptide complexes. We altered the sequence of the DNA strand 3′ of the CCCTT cleavage site so as to place a C:G base pair at the −2 position (Fig. 2 B). Synthetic 18-mer strands containing a single R or S BPdG adduct at the −2 nucleoside of the nonscissile strand were annealed to the complementary 5′32P-labeled 34-mer scissile strand to form a 34-mer/18-mer suicide substrate. The reaction of topoisomerase with the unmodified control substrate attained an end point of 89% covalent enzyme-DNA formation with a cleavage rate constant of 0.25 s−1 (Fig.2 B). The −2S and −2R BPdG adducts had no interfering effects on the rate or extent of transesterification. Indeed, the cleavage of both −2 adducts was about twice as fast as the unmodified DNA. (A rate constant of 0.5 s−1 is at the upper limit of what we can measure by manual assay.) Analysis of the cleavage products by PAGE after proteinase K digestion showed that the −2R and −2S BPdG modifications did not alter the site of topoisomerase transesterification to the scissile strand (Fig. 4, lanes 7and 8). Taken together, the −1 and −2 BPdG interference experiments define the “downstream” margin of the minor groove interface between vaccinia topoisomerase and its target site, said margin being between the +1 and −1 base pairs (Fig. 2). Previous studies suggested that N7 methylation of the +5, +4, and +3 guanines in the major groove interfered with noncovalent binding of vaccinia topoisomerase to its target site (8Shuman S. Turner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18943-18950Google Scholar). To explore the minor groove interface with the DNA on the covalently held side of the scissile phosphodiester, we introduced Rand S BPdG adducts at the +5, +4, and +3 nucleosides of the 3′-GGGAA sequence and measured the rate and extent of single turnover transesterification by vaccinia topoisomerase on the BPdG-modified substrates (Fig. 5). The unmodified substrate was cleaved to an extent of 93% of the input-labeled DNA with an apparent rate constant of 0.37 s−1. The +5R BPdG modification had no significant effect on either the rate or extent of transesterification (k + 5R = 0.25 s−1; 87% end point cleavage). The +5S isomer had only a modest (3-fold) slowing effect on the cleavage rate and little impact on the end point (k + 5S = 0.12 s−1; 80% yield) (Fig. 5). The electrophoretic mobility of the cluster of proteinase K-digested reaction products formed with the +5S and +5R BPdG substrates was unaltered compared with the cluster produced by cleavage of unmodified DNA (Fig. 4, lanes 13 and14). Phasing the BPdG modifications 1 or 2 nucleotides closer to the scissile phosphodiester dramatically reduced the rate and the extent of the DNA cleavage reaction (Fig. 5). The reactions with the +4R, +4S, +3R, and +3S BPdG-modified substrates occurred with similar rates of approach to the reaction endpoints (k cl = 0.0002 s−1), which were attained when 18%, 6.3%, 7.4%, and 5.8% of the input DNA was transferred to the topoisomerase polypeptide. Neither the rate nor the end point increased when the concentration of topoisomerase was doubled, implying that the reaction was not limited by the noncovalent binding step. Rather, we surmise that the majority of the topoisomerase binding events are nonproductive with respect to transesterification and that there is not a free equilibrium between productive and nonproductive binding modes (at least not within the 24-h time-frame in which the reactions were monitored). Although the yields were low, the mobility of the p"

Nature. 1989; 339: 27-30Google Scholar). In response to a demand by the body for mature blood cells, the stem cells generate a group of progenitor cell population, that express specific cytokine receptors on their surface and proliferate or differentiate in response to the cognate cytokine binding (1Metcalf D. Nature. 1989; 339: 27-30Google Scholar). It is becoming increasingly evident that the proto-oncogene c-myb plays the role of a master regulator of hematopoietic cell development. Thus, in mammalian cells, c-myb is highly expressed in immature hematopoietic cells, and its expression is down-regulated during terminal differentiation of these cells (2Duprey S.P. Boettiger D.

In addition, inhibition of c-Myb expression using antisense oligonucleotides has been shown to cause growth arrest of several hematopoietic cell lines and interfere with normal human hematopoiesis in vitro(13Anfossi G.

The myb gene product codes for a major translational product of 75 kDa, which is localized to the nucleus and acts as a mediator of transcriptional regulation (7Westin E.H. Gallo R.C. Arya S.K.

Like most transcription factors, the protein encoded by this gene exhibits a modular structure, with an N-terminal DNA binding domain, a central transactivation domain and a C-terminal negative regulatory domain (reviewed in Ref. 20Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3017-3033Google Scholar). Many target genes have been identified for c-Myb, which include genes such as mim-1, TCRβ, the neutrophil elastase gene, the homeobox gene GBX2 as well as several proto-oncogenes such as c-kit and c-myc (reviewed in Refs.20Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3017-3033Google Scholar, 21Ness S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: F123-F139Google Scholar, 22Ness S.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3039-3046Google Scholar). Of these the most interesting is the c-myc gene, which also codes for a nuclear transcription factor and has been shown to be intimately associate with cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 23Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2967-2987Google Scholar and 24Schmidt E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2988-2996Google Scholar). The c-Myc protein belongs to the family of transcription factors that contain the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) domains at the C-terminal end, which mediate the DNA binding and homo- and heterodimer formation (reviewed in Ref. 25Luscher B. Larsson L.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2955-2966Google Scholar). Thus the c-Myc protein was found to require the formation of heterodimers with its partner, Max, for sequence-specific DNA binding as well as for biological activity (reviewed in Ref. 25Luscher B. Larsson L.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2955-2966Google Scholar). While the c-myc and c-myb genes are co-expressed in many hematopoietic cells, the c-myc gene expression is seen more ubiquitously than that of c-myb, suggesting that c-myb does not regulate c-myc expression in all cell types (reviewed in Refs. 20Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3017-3033Google Scholar and 26Nesbit C.E. Tersak J.M. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3004-3016Google Scholar). The interrelationship between c-myb and c-myc was best studied in the myeloid leukemic M1 cell line, which is a transformed mouse myeloid cell line that proliferates autonomously in a factor-independent manner and forms tumors in nude mice (12Selvakumaran M. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2493-2500Google Scholar, 27Schmidt M. Nazarov V. Stevens L. Watson R. Wolff L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1970-1981Google Scholar). However, this cell line was found to undergo terminal differentiation and growth arrest, when cultured in the presence of IL-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (28Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 903-909Google Scholar, 29Lord K.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 387-396Google Scholar, 30Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. Brugge J.S. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4371-4379Google Scholar). Under conditions that allow continuous proliferation, these cells were found to express high levels of c-Myc and c-Myb, and the expression of these two proto-oncogenes is down-regulated following treatment with IL-6 or LIF, which induce terminal differentiation (31Hoffman-Liebermann B. Liebermann D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2375-2381Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that constitutive expression of c-Myb or c-Myc in these cells results in a block to IL-6- or LIF-induced terminal differentiation (4Kastan M.B. Stone K.D. Civin C.I. Blood. 1989; 74: 1517-1524Google Scholar, 12Selvakumaran M. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2493-2500Google Scholar). However, while constitutive expression of c-Myb in these cells lead to a block in terminal differentiation at an early stage, similar expression of c-Myc was found to result in a block leading to an intermediate stage myeloid cells, suggesting that the two proto-oncogenes mediate differentiation by different mechanisms (4Kastan M.B. Stone K.D. Civin C.I. Blood. 1989; 74: 1517-1524Google Scholar,12Selvakumaran M. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2493-2500Google Scholar). However, in a recent study, it was observed that conditional expression of a Myb-estrogen receptor fusion protein (Myb-ER) in IL-6-treated M1 cells resulted in the restoration of expression of c-Myc expression (that was down-regulated by IL-6) and restored the proliferative activity of IL-6-treated M1 cells (27Schmidt M. Nazarov V. Stevens L. Watson R. Wolff L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1970-1981Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of a dominant-negative mutant of c-Myb in a mouse myeloid leukemic cell line, RI-4-11 resulted in the down-regulation of c-Myc expression leading to the suggestion that c-Myc may be solely responsible for Myb-mediated proliferation (27Schmidt M. Nazarov V. Stevens L. Watson R. Wolff L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1970-1981Google Scholar). While these studies conducted in the M1 cell line are very informative for our understanding of the role of myc and mybin the differentiation of myeloid cells along the monocytic pathway, it is at present unclear whether they play a similar role in the differentiation of myeloid cells along the granulocytic pathway. In addition, these studies suffer from the problem that M1 cells are tumorigenic and, unlike normal hematopoietic cells, proliferate in a factor-independent manner. To gain an understanding of the relationships that exist between myb and myc in myeloid cell differentiation along the granulocytic pathway, we investigated the role of these two genes in GCSF-induced terminal differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells. These cells, derived from normal mouse bone marrow, have been found to be strictly dependent on IL-3 for growth and undergo terminal differentiation when placed in an IL-3-free medium containing GCSF (32Rovera G. Kreider B. Shirsat N. Venturelli D. Naso G. Mavilio F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 567: 154-164Google Scholar, 33Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835Google Scholar). However, when the cells were incubated in the absence of IL-3 or GCSF, they were found to become arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and rapidly enter apoptotic pathways loosing viability in 48–96 h (34Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922Google Scholar). We and others (9Bies J. Mukhopadhyaya R. Pierce J. Wolff L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 59-68Google Scholar, 10Patel G. Kreider B. Rovera G. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2269-2276Google Scholar, 11Patel G. Tantravahi R. Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1197-1208Google Scholar) had previously shown that overexpression of v-Myb or c-Myb in these cells results in a block to their ability to terminally differentiate into granulocytes in the presence of G-CSF. This cell line was particularly useful for studies aimed at understanding the effects of oncogenes and proto-oncogenes on myeloid differentiation as it is not predisposed to develop factor-independent clones (34Askew D.S. Ashmun R.A. Simmons B.C. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1915-1922Google Scholar). Results presented in this communication show that while ectopic overexpression of c-Myb in 32Dcl3 cells (32D/Myb) resulted in a block to the GCSF-induced terminal differentiation of these cells, ectopic overexpression of c-Myc (32D/Myc) failed to achieve the same effect. However, ectopic overexpression of c-Myb was found to result in elevated expression of c-Myc, and expression of dominant-negative mutants of c-Myc in 32D/Myb cells was found to result in a block to Myb-mediated effects on the terminal differentiation program of these cells. Similarly, in M1 cells, c-Myc dominant-negative mutants were found to relieve c-Myb-mediated block in terminal differentiation. These results led us to conclude that c-myc is a target of c-Myb, and activation of the c-myc gene is a necessary event in Myb-mediated transformation. However, ectopic overexpression of c-Myc expression alone was inadequate to elicit the phenotypic effects seen with Myb-mediated block in differentiation of myeloid cells along the granulocytic pathway, suggesting that activation of additional transcriptional targets by c-Myb is necessary for this process.

The pOPRSVI-Puro/MCS was constructed by replacing the neomycin cassette in pOPRSVI/MCS (Stratagene) with a puromycin cassette (38Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Therap. 1994; 1: 136-138Google Scholar). The myc dominant-negative constructs, mycRX and max2RX, were subcloned into pOPRSVI-Puro/MCS to express these constructs in 32Dcl3 cells. The murine myeloid progenitor cell line, 32Dcl3 (32Rovera G. Kreider B. Shirsat N. Venturelli D. Naso G. Mavilio F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 567: 154-164Google Scholar, 33Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835Google Scholar), was maintained in Isocove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% WEHI3B cell-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3 (39Ymer S. Tucker W.Q. Sanderson C.J. Hapel A.J. Campbell H.D. Young I.G. Nature. 1985; 317: 255-258Google Scholar). Since all the cell lines established had metallothionein promoter-based constructs, 100 μmZnCl2 was also used in all experiments. The M1 cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% horse serum and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin. To induce granulocyte differentiation, parental or transfected 32Dcl3 cells were washed twice in IL-3-free medium and plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml in IMDM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% GCSF (32Rovera G. Kreider B. Shirsat N. Venturelli D. Naso G. Mavilio F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 567: 154-164Google Scholar). The viability and proliferation of the cell cultures were monitored for the indicated days. Morphological analysis of GCSF-treated cells was performed using an aliquot of cells that was cytospun and stained with May-Grunwald-Geimsa stain. The antibiotic-resistant M1 cells were induced to differentiate with conditioned medium containing IL-6. After 4 days, cytospin smears of the IL-6-treated cells were prepared and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain. For transfection into QT6 fibroblasts, cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 0.5 × 105 cells/well. The following day, DNA were transfected by calcium phosphate method (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocol. In each transfection, 5 μg of reporter plasmid (LK444A/c-myc) and 5 μg of effector plasmid were transfected along with 0.5 μg of pRL-CH110 as an internal standard. The effector plasmid, pODC (228–281), was constructed by ligating firefly luciferase gene with the ODC promoter region −228 to −281 (51Bello-Fernandez C. Packham G. Cleveland J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7804-7808Google Scholar). The internal control plasmid, pRL-CH110, was constructed by ligating the Renilla luciferase gene to the RSV promoter. For transient transfections with the myc dominant-negatives, 15 μg of the corresponding dominant-negative construct was also added to the DNA mixture above to get a final ratio of 1:3 betweenmyc transcriptional activator and dominant-negative transcriptional suppressors. Following incubation for 24 h, cells were washed and incubated in fresh medium for additional 24 h. After 48 h of post-transfection, cells were lysed in 500 μl/well of Passive Lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was assayed using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Plasmid System (Promega). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized against Renillaluciferase activity to determine relative luciferase activity, and the activation fold was obtained by setting the value of the empty vector control as 1.0. 32Dcl3 cells expressing pMT-Neo (empty vector) and pMT/c-myb have been described previously (37Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21432-21443Google Scholar). For stable transfection of 32Dcl3 cells, exponentially growing 32Dcl3 cells were electroporated with various linearized plasmids DNAs using a Gene-Pulser (BioRad) at a pulse of 230 V, 960 mF. The surviving cells were selected in 1 mg/ml of G418 (pMT-neo based constructs) or in 1 mg/ml of G418 and 2 μg/ml of puromycin (pMT-neo/pOPRSVI-Puro-based constructs) for 2–3 weeks. For M1 cells, the cDNA encoding for c-Myb was subcloned into the retroviral vector MSCVneo, while the cDNAs encoding for MycRX and Max2RX were subcloned into MSCVpac (38Hawley R.G. Lieu F.H. Fong A.Z. Hawley T.S. Gene Therap. 1994; 1: 136-138Google Scholar). The vectors were transfected into packaging cell line Phenix together with the expression vector VSV-G (Stratagene). Vector, MycRX, and Max2RX retroviral supernatants were harvested to infect M1 cells. The infected cells were selected in puromycin (2 μg/ml). The puromycin-resistant cells were further infected with c-Myb retroviral supernatant. The infected cells were then selected in puromycin and G418 (0.4 mg/ml). Total RNA from each cell line in the presence of IL-3 was isolated and purified using the Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen). 20 μg of total RNA was used per sample, and Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (37Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21432-21443Google Scholar). Full-length c-myb, c-myc, mycRX, and max2RX cDNAs were used to detect c-myb, c-myc, mycRX, and max2RX mRNA transcripts. As an internal control for RNA loading, gels were stained with ethidium bromide to compare levels of 18 S/28 S ribosomal RNAs across lanes. Anti-Myc and anti-Max primary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. To analyze protein products of the transfected c-myb gene in 32Dcl3 cells, normalized amounts of proteins from each cell lysate were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21432-21443Google Scholar), and separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 10.5). The filter was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with primary anti-c-Myb polyclonal antibody (37Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21432-21443Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C and washed three times in TBS-T solution. The secondary antibody reaction was performed by incubating the filters with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Biosciences) and washed in a similar manner as was described for the primary antibody reaction. The Amersham Biosciences ECL detection system was used for visualization as specified by the manufacturer. To detect protein products of c-Myc, MycRX and Max2RX, anti-c-Myc N262, anti-Max C124, and anti-c-Myc 9E10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibodies and 3% nonfat milk were used in the protocol described above. DNA fragments released from 10 × 106 cells were extracted and separated by electrophoresis in agarose gels (40Arends M.J. Morris R.G. Wyllie A.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 593-608Google Scholar). After experiments, cells were lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mmTris, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and 200 mg/ml proteinase K. Cell lysates were then incubated at 42 °C for 90 min, treated with 0.2 mg/ml RNase A and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was then extracted twice with phenol/chloroform (1:1). DNA fragments were precipitated with one-tenth volume of 3 mNaOAc and 2.5 volumes of ethanol at −20 °C overnight and resuspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. 2 mg of DNA were then analyzed on a 2% agarose gel. Mock-transfected and c-myc-transfected 32Dcl3 cells were analyzed for cell viability in the absence of IL-3 at different time points. At the indicated time points, viable and non-viable cells were identified by trypan blue exclusion/inclusion, counted in triplicates on a hemocytometer and percentage of viable cells calculated. The role of c-Myb on myeloid cell growth and differentiation has been studied previously (37Oh I.H. Reddy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21432-21443Google Scholar). To study the effect of c-Myc on myeloid differentiation along the granulocytic pathway and compare it with that of c-Myb, we used the 32Dcl3 cell line. This cell line is derived from normal mouse bone marrow and was found to be strictly dependent on IL-3 for proliferation (33Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835Google Scholar, 41Greenberger J.S. Sakakeeny M.A. Humphries R.K. Eaves C.J. Eckner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2931-2935Google Scholar). In the absence of IL-3, the cells undergo death via apoptosis over a period of 24–72 h. Upon addition of GCSF, these cells terminally differentiate into granulocytes over a period of 10–12 days (10Patel G. Kreider B. Rovera G. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2269-2276Google Scholar, 32Rovera G. Kreider B. Shirsat N. Venturelli D. Naso G. Mavilio F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1989; 567: 154-164Google Scholar, 33Valtieri M. Tweardy D.J. Caracciolo D. Johnson K. Mavilio F. Altmann S. Santoli D. Rovera G. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 3829-3835Google Scholar). The linearized c-myb cDNA construct in pMT-Neo (under the control of metallothionein promoter) and c-myc cDNA construct in LK444A (under the control of actin promoter) were transfected into 32Dcl3 cells by electroporation. As negative controls, empty vector DNAs, pMT-Neo, and LK444A, was similarly introduced into 32Dcl3 cells. Following selection with G418, mass cultures were established from stable transfections. The derived cell lines were tested for the expression of each transgene. In the case of pMT-Neo based constructs, the expression levels were analyzed in the presence of Zn2+, which acts as an inducer of transcription from the metallothionein promoter. The profiles of mRNA induction in these cell lines are shown in Fig. 1, A and B. The parental 32Dcl3 cells (32D/wild-type) and those transfected with empty vector DNA (32D/pMTneo) showed the presence of a 3.4-kb endogenous c-myb band (Fig. 1 A). In cells transfected with c-myb (32D/pMT/c-myb in Fig.1 A), transgenic c-myb expression was seen as a 2.3-kb transcript. Similarly, the parental 32Dcl3 cells (32D/wild-type) and the cells transfected with empty vector DNA (32D/LK444A) showed the presence of a 2.4-kb endogenous c-myc band (Fig.1 B). In cells transfected with c-myc(32D/LK444A/c-myc/1 and 32D/LK444A/c-myc/2 in Fig. 1 B), transgenic c-myc expression was seen as a 1.4-kb transcript. The smaller size of the transgenic transcripts are due to the absence of the 3′-untranslated sequence, which was deleted during the construction of these expression plasmids. To definitely demonstrate expression of c-Myb and c-Myc proteins from the transgenes, we compared the protein levels following incubation of 32D cells in the presence of GCSF for 10 days. It was shown previously that, in 32Dcl3 cells, the endogenous levels of c-Myb and c-Myc proteins remain relatively high until day 6–8 of GCSF treatment followed by a downward regulation of mRNA and protein, such that they become undetectable by day 10 of GCSF treatment (9Bies J. Mukhopadhyaya R. Pierce J. Wolff L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 59-68Google Scholar, 10Patel G. Kreider B. Rovera G. Reddy E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2269-2276Google Scholar). Taking advantage of this observation, we analyzed the levels of c-Myb and c-Myc proteins on the 10th day of GCSF treatment in the transfected cells to determine the levels of the transgenic proteins expressed in the absence of the endogenous protein product. As shown in Fig. 1 C, on the 10th day of GCSF treatment, the parental and empty vector-transfected cells were found to express little c-Myb protein. On the other hand, in the c-myb-transfected cells, high levels of c-Myb protein were detected. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 1 D, after incubation in medium containing GCSF for 10 days, the empty vector-transfected cells were found to express little c-Myc protein. However, the c-myc-transfected cells showed the presence of high levels of c-Myc protein product. Following the verification of the expression of transgene, we tested the effects of overexpression of c-Myb and c-Myc on GCSF-induced terminal differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells. 32Dcl3 cells transfected with empty vectors or with c-myb and c-myc transgenes were removed from IL-3-containing medium, washed twice, and cultured in the presence of GCSF. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig.2. Parental 32Dcl3 cells or cells transfected with the empty vectors (32D/pMT-Neo in Fig. 2 Aand 32D/LK444A in Fig. 2 B) undergo several rounds of cell division followed by growth arrest around day 8 of GCSF treatment. On the other hand, 32D/c-myb cells showed a significantly higher proliferative potential (Fig. 2 A) and continued to undergo cell division exponentially. Interestingly, 32D/c-myc cells (32D/c-myc/1 and 32D/c-myc/2 in Fig. 2 B) behaved very similar to mock-transfected cells, i.e.c-myc-transfected cells underwent cell divisions until day 8 after which their proliferative potential declined. Thus c-Myb and c-Myc conferred different properties to 32D cells in response to GCSF. While constitutive expression of c-Myb markedly enhanced the growth potential of 32D cells in response to GCSF, the expression of c-Myc apparently did not alter the normal pattern of 32D cell growth in GCSF. Morphological analysis of the cells treated with GCSF is presented in Fig. 3. Cells transfected with empty vector plasmids (32D/pMT-Neo and 32D/LK444A), when treated with GCSF, showed a progressive increase in the appearance of mature forms, which included the myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and granulocytes. By day 10, the entire population was completely replaced by terminally differentiated cells, consisting of metamyelocytes and granulocytes (Fig. 3). In contrast, 32D/c-myb cells showed little evidence of progression to a differentiated phenotype and continued to proliferate indefinitely in GCSF-containing medium as myelocytes/promyelocytes. Interestingly and in agreement with data presented in Fig. 2, both the vector-transfected cells and 32D/c-myc cells progressed through the normal pattern of differentiation when treated with GCSF and by day 10 were terminally differentiated into granulocytes. Again, c-Myb and c-Myc had different effects on 32D cell differentiation program. Whereas ectopic expression of c-Myb completely blocks the ability of these cells to differentiate in response to GCSF, c-Myc by itself apparently had no effect on 32D cell differentiation."

Type I AFPs are α-helical, partially amphipathic, Ala-rich polypeptides. The winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) produces two type I AFP subclasses, the liver-type AFPs (wflAFPs) and the skin-type AFPs (wfsAFPs), that are encoded by distinct gene families with different tissue-specific expression. wfsAFPs and wflAFPs share a high level of identity even though the wfsAFPs have approximately half the activity of the wflAFPs. Synthetic polypeptides based on two representative wflAFPs and wfsAFPs were generated to examine the role of the termini in antifreeze activity. Through systematic exchange of N and C termini between wflAFP-6 and wfsAFP-2, the termini were determined to be the major causative agents for the variation in activity levels between the two AFPs. Furthermore, the termini of wflAFP-6 possessed greater helix-stabilizing ability compared with their wfsAFP-2 counterparts. The observed 50% difference in activity between wflAFP-6 and wfsAFP-2 can be divided into ∼20% for differences at each termini and ∼10% for differences in the core.

The winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) produces two subclasses of type I AFPs, the liver-type (wflAFPs) and the skin-type AFPs (wfsAFPs), which are encoded by distinct gene families (9Gong Z.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4106-4112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). wflAFP-6 (formerly known as HPLC-6) is the major winter flounder plasma AFP and is produced in the liver as a prepro-precursor, and then secreted into circulation, where it is then processed into the mature polypeptide of 37 residues (10Davies P.L.

Ewart K.V. Hu Z. Fletcher G.L. Hew C.L. J. Biol.

Both wflAFPs and wfsAFPs possess two 11-residue motifs of the structure TaaXAXXAAXX (where the first Thr is always conserved, uppercase A is a conserved Ala, lowercase a is almost always Ala, and X can be one of several amino acids), with wflAFP-6 having a third full motif at the N terminus (see Fig. 1). Furthermore, the wflAFPs possess complete ice-binding motifs (IBMs), LTAAN (8Sicheri F. Yang D.S. Nature. 1995; 375: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), whereas the wfsAFPs have incomplete IBMs of the form ATAAA, and this difference in IBMs has been proposed to be the cause of the lower thermal hysteresis found in wfsAFPs (12Lin Q. Ewart K.V. Yang D.S. Hew C.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the introduction of two proposed IBMs (KT-D, and DT-K) into wfsAFP-2 did not produce any improvement in activity (12Lin Q. Ewart K.V. Yang D.S. Hew C.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the introduction of the LTAAN IBM into wfsAFP-2 only increased the activity by ∼15%, yet lowered the helical content from 80 to 60%. 2Q. Lin, W. Low, and C. L. Hew, manuscript in preparation. 2Q. Lin, W. Low, and C. L.

However, recent study of wflAFP-6 has suggested that the major ice-binding surface resides on the hydrophobic face of the polypeptide, with major contribution from conserved Ala residues. Furthermore, the driving forces behind ice binding are van der Waals interactions and the hydrophobic effect (17Chao H. Houston Jr., M.E. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Loewen M.C. Davies P.L.

The major sequence variations between wflAFP-6 and the wfsAFPs are in the N and C termini (see Fig. 1). Most notably, wflAFP-6 has the N-terminal sequence DTASDA, whereas all wfsAFPs begin with MDAP (9Gong Z. Ewart K.V. Hu Z. Fletcher G.L. Hew C.L. J. Biol.

Polypeptides were synthesized where the N- and C-terminal sequences of two representative AFPs, wflAFP-6 and wfsAFP-2, were systematically exchanged, then assayed for antifreeze activity and α-helical content. The results demonstrated that the difference in activity was caused primarily by sequence variations at the N and C termini. Furthermore, the N and C termini of wflAFP-6 were able to confer higher overall helical content and greater thermal stability over their skin-type AFP counterparts.RESULTSA comparison of wflAFP-6 and wfsAFP-2 sequences demonstrated that the region of highest identity between the two polypeptides occurs in the central region (wflAFP-6 core; L-core and wfsAFP-2 core; S-core), with no identity at the termini (see Fig.1 A). For wflAFP-6, the N-terminal sequence, [L]-Nterm, was defined as DTASDA, and the C-terminal sequence, [L]-Cterm, was defined as AR. Correspondingly, in wfsAFP-2, the N-terminal sequence, [S]-Nterm, was defined as MDAP, and C-terminal sequence, [S]-Cterm, defined as KAGAAR.The synthetic polypeptides were designed to examine the effects of N-terminal exchange, C-terminal exchange, and simultaneous exchange of both termini. In the N-terminal exchange series, polypeptides consisting of wild-type sequences for wfsAFP-2 and wflAFP-6, Skin(wt) and Liver(wt), were also assayed. The Skin(wt) activity was ∼50% of Liver(wt) (Fig. 2 D), in agreement with previous results (9Gong Z. Ewart K.V. Hu Z. Fletcher G.L. Hew C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4106-4112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For ease of comparison, all activity levels were expressed as a percentage of Liver(wt) activity. Skin(wt) was used as an internal control to allow comparison of results between the three groups of polypeptides. Fig. 2 D summarizes the observed activity levels for each polypeptide, and TableI (column 1) details the difference in activity between polypeptides that varied at a single region. In each instance (Table I, column 1) differences in activity levels were determined to be statistically significant.Figure 2Thermal hysteresis levels of the synthetic polypeptides.

The conversion of the wflAFP-6 N or C terminus to the corresponding wfsAFP-2 sequences resulted in a loss of ∼27% of activity (Fig. 2 D; Table I, column 1, values A1 and C1). In wfsAFP-2, replacement of the N or C terminus with those found in wflAFP-6 resulted in a gain of ∼15% in activity (Fig. 2 D; Table I, column 1, values A3 and C3).When [S]-Nterm was replaced by [L]-Nterm, the magnitude of the increased activity was ∼14% greater when the remaining polypeptide contained L-core and [L]-Cterm (TableII, column 1, A1–A3 value). When the remaining polypeptide was composed of a mixture of components, the increase in activity associated with the same exchange was ∼4% higher in the presence of S-core and [L]-Cterm as opposed to L-core and [S]-Cterm (Table II, column 1, A4–A2 value). Similarly, for the exchange of [S]-Cterm with [L]-Cterm, the increased activity was ∼11% higher when wflAFP-6 components were present (Table II, column 1, C1–C3 value). Furthermore, the increased activity associated with this exchange was ∼7% higher when [L]-Nterm and S-core were present as opposed to the opposite composition (Table II, column 1, C4-C2 value).Simultaneous Exchange of N- and C-terminal SequencesThe [L]Skin[L] polypeptide was similar to a previously studied wflAFP-6 mutation, ATAAA, which was reported to have ∼85% of the activity of a wild-type analogue as determined by the activity curves presented by Loewen et al. (29Loewen M.C. Chao H. Houston Jr., M.E. Baardsnes J. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Sonnichsen F.D. Davies P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4743-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The ATAAA analogue differed from [L]Skin[L] at positions 8 and 30, where ATAAA possessed Ala instead of Lys. Loewen et al. (29Loewen M.C. Chao H. Houston Jr., M.E. Baardsnes J. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Sonnichsen F.D. Davies P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4743-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) observed lowered solubility for ATAAA, which affected their analysis of the analogue; however, no solubility issues were observed with [L]Skin[L] for the concentrations used here. If the experimental error of ∼5% between assays is considered, then the combined effects of N- and C-terminal exchange on thermal hysteresis levels appeared to be somewhat additive. For [L]Skin and Skin[L], activity was increased in each case to ∼64%, and ∼67% of Liver(wt) (Fig. 2 D). In combination, the exchange of both N- and C-terminal sequences, [L]Skin[L], resulted in activity of ∼89%. Similarly, the 54% level of activity for [S]Liver[S] was close to the level of activity expected from the combined reductions for each individual exchange.The simultaneous exchange of both termini was also evaluated as a single exchange in the core region. Thus, replacement of L-core in wflAFP-6 with S-core (essentially a replacement of complete IBMs with incomplete IBMs) resulted in a loss of ∼11% of activity (Table I, column 1, value B1). The corresponding exchange in wfsAFP-2 resulted in a gain of ∼3% in activity (Table I, column 1, value B3). The magnitude of the effect of the S-core to L-core exchange was greater by ∼7% in the context of the wflAFP-6 termini than for the wfsAFP-2 termini (Table II, column 1, B1-B3 value). In the mixed-termini case, the magnitude of the exchange was more prominent by ∼3% when the termini were composed of [L]-Nterm and [S]-Cterm then when composed of [S]-Nterm and [L]-Cterm (Table II, column 1, B4-B2 value).Pairwise Comparison of the Effects of the N Terminus, Core Region, and C Terminus on Antifreeze ActivityA pairwise comparison of activity levels between polypeptides that differed at a single region was performed to address the experimental error involved in each individual assay. Each region of wflAFP-6 demonstrated a higher level of activity than the corresponding region of wfsAFP-2. The [L]-Nterm provided an average improvement of ∼20% (± 6%), L-core an improvement of ∼7% (± 4%), and [L]-Cterm an improvement of ∼22% (± 5%) in activity over the corresponding wfsAFP-2 components (Table I, column 1). Only in the evaluation of the core region did the error significantly impact the average value determined; nevertheless, the general trend was toward higher activity when the L-core was present as opposed to the S-core. However, as demonstrated in Table II, the magnitude of the increased activity associated with a wflAFP-6 region over that of the corresponding wfsAFP-2 region was dependent on the identities of the remaining regions.The Magnitude of the Increase in Activity Associated with a wflAFP-6 Component Is Dependent on the Identity of the Remaining RegionsIn Table II (columns 3 and 5), a comparison of the values in Table I (column 1) was performed to determine the impact of the identities of the other regions that were present during the three exchanges. The presence of [L]-Cterm during exchange at the N terminus produced a ∼9% higher improvement of activity compared with when the [S]-Cterm was present (Table II, column 3, A), and a ∼5% higher improvement of activity was observed in the presence of L-core compared with S-core (Table II, column 5, A). Thus, a 4% higher improvement of activity (Ax 1-Ax 2 value) was observed when the wflAFP-6 component was present at the C terminus compared with when it was present within the core. Similarly, the improved activity of L-core over S-core demonstrated a 5% higher increase in the presence of [L]-Nterm over [S]-Nterm (Table II, column 3, B). For this same exchange, a slightly higher increase in activity was noted in the presence of [L]-Cterm when [S]-Nterm was present. However, the observed increase in activity when [L]-Nterm was present was not statistically significant (Table II, column 6, B). In this exchange, the improvement of activity associated with L-core was higher when wflAFP-6 components were present at the N terminus as compared with when they were present at the C terminus (Bx1-Bx2 value). The improvement of activity with [L]-Cterm in place of [S]-Cterm demonstrated a 9% higher enhancement in the presence of [L]-Nterm (Table II, column 5, C). For this exchange, the increased difference in activity levels when L-core was present was not statistically significant when [L]-Nterm was also present; however, the result was significant in the presence of [S]-Nterm (Table II, column 6, C). For this exchange, the improvement in activity was higher when wflAFP-6 components were present at the N terminus compared with when they were present in the core (Cx1–Cx2 value). All trends indicated that the improvement of activity associated with each wflAFP-6 component was always greater when other regions of wflAFP-6 were present. Furthermore, the location of the other wflAFP-6 components demonstrated differing levels of influence on the increased activity associated with each exchange, with the order of dependence for other regions being N terminus > C terminus > core. This order of dependence was also apparent in the values determined in column 1 (Table II). For example, in the A4–A2 value (Table II, column 1, A), the degree of activity enhancement was higher for the S-core and [L]-Cterm combination than for L-core and [S]-Cterm because the effect of the C terminus took precedence. This dependence appeared to have a “long range” effect, as the increased activity associated with [L]-Nterm over [S]-Nterm was more dependent on the identity of the opposite terminus, not the core region that was adjacent to it. The dependence of activity levels on the identity of the opposite terminus was also observed with the C terminus exchange.α-Helical Content of Polypeptides at 0 °CEach polypeptide was assayed for its α-helical content utilizing circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Spectra (data not shown) were recorded at 0 and 40 °C in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.9) at two different concentrations. At 0 °C, all polypeptides displayed spectra indicative of high α-helical content with typical negative minima at 222 and 208 nm, and positive maximums at approximately 192 nm. At 40 °C, the spectra were indicative of helix-random coil mixed structures and were identical at two different concentrations. Helical content determinations indicated Liver(wt) to be nearly entirely α-helical (∼95%), which was in good agreement with previous structural studies of wflAFP-6 (8Sicheri F. Yang D.S.

The decreases in helical content between Liver(wt) and [S]Liver (10.3%), and between Liver(wt) and Liver[S] (8.9%), gave a combined decrease of 19.2% that would predict a helical content of 75.3% for [S]Liver[S], which was close to the observed value of 77.9%. However, for wfsAFP-2, replacement of the C terminus alone (Skin[L]) produced ∼100% helical content (Fig.3 A), whereas [L]Skin demonstrated ∼90% helical content.Pairwise Comparison of the Effects of the N Terminus, Core Region, and C Terminus on α-Helical ContentThe differences in helical content between polypeptides that differed at a single region are summarized in Table I, column 3. Several of the differences were found not to be statistically significant in this comparison; however, in three of these instances, the p values were close to the α value of 0.05 used in the analysis (Table I, column 4, a2, b1, and c2). Overall, the results of the pairwise comparison of the effects of exchanges on helical content were not as consistent as for the activity analysis, because of the aberrant values found for Skin[L] (Table I, column 3). However, if the results were evaluated without Skin[L] (Table I, column 5 in parts A and B), the [L]-Nterm imparted ∼8.7% higher helical content than the [S]-Nterm. Conversely, the L-core sequence was ∼4.5% less helical than the corresponding S-core region. Although the experimental error would preclude forming conclusions based on the assay of individual polypeptide comparisons, the general trend observed in the pairwise comparison indicated that the [L]-Nterm induced a higher helical content than the [S]-Nterm, whereas the S-core induced a higher helical content than the L-core.For the C-terminal exchange, the [L]-Cterm always produced higher helical content than [S]-Cterm. Only in the presence of [S]-Nterm and L-core was the increased helical content (Table I, column 3, c2 value) associated with [L]-Cterm found to be statistically insignificant. However, a dependence on the nature of the core sequence for the increased helicity associated with [L]-Cterm was observed, as helical content was ∼10% higher when the S-core was present (TableI, column 6). When the L-core was present, the [L]-Nterm demonstrated a greater effect on enhanced helicity in the presence of the [L]-Cterm (8.9 − 6.3% = 2.6%). Conversely, when the S-core was present, the [S]-Nterm provided higher enhancement of helicity in the presence of the [L]-Cterm (16.5% − 20.3% = −3.8%). In both instances, the difference values were based on a single scenario, unlike earlier comparisons where trends could be discerned because of multiple values from independent comparisons. However, these results may indicate that the dependence on the nature of the core region is further enhanced when the core region is associated with its native N terminus. An analysis of the helicity values obtained for the N-terminal exchange demonstrated that the same relationship existed for the N terminus. The effect of higher helical content associated with [L]-Nterm was greater in the presence of L-core, but when either core was present, the increased helical content was higher when each core was associated with its own C terminus (Table I, column 3, A).Correlation of Activity Levels and Helical ContentWhen comparing all analogues studied, activity levels increased as helical content increased (Fig. 4 A). However, for all analogues, a rigorous direct correlation between helical content and activity was not observed (Fig. 4 A, overall linear regression line). If the L-core and S-core analogues are analyzed separately, the analogues containing L-core demonstrated a very good direct correlation between activity and helical content (R 2 = 0.990), whereas the S-core containing analogues still demonstrated a low level of direct correlation. Examination of the residuals for the linear regression for all analogues demonstrated that a reasonably good correlation between activity and helical content existed until the polypeptides achieved a helical content of ∼90%, beyond which the correlation became very poor.Figure 4A comparison of the observed activity levels and the helical content for each analogue.

For wflAFP-6, helix predictions were based on the assumption that each region ([L]-Nterm, L-core, and [L]-Cterm) was 100% helical based on structural data (8Sicheri F. Yang D.S. Nature. 1995; 375: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 31Gronwald W. Chao H. Reddy D.V. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Sonnichsen F.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16698-16704Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For wfsAFP-2, the assignments were based on current theories of helix capping (see “Discussion” for rationale behind assignment of helical and non-helical residues). In the [S]-Nterm, 3 of 4 residues were assumed to be non-helical (all residues preceding Pro4), the S-core was assumed to be 100% helical, and in [S]-Cterm, 4 of 6 residues were assumed to be non-helical (all residues following and including Gly-36). The predicted helical contents for each polypeptide was then simply arrived at by determining the total number of residues in a helical conformation under the assumption that each region was independent of effects caused by the identity of the other regions. Examination of all polypeptides that contained the S-core demonstrated a remarkably high correlation o"
