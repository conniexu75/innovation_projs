https://openalex.org/W1980479552,"WE have recently been studying the blue serum globulin described by Luetscher1, Pedersen2, Holmberg3 and Cohn et al.4. We have found that it has a copper content of about 0·05 per cent. By denaturing with a mixture of ethyl alcohol and chloroform and fractionating the supernatant solution with ammonium sulphate, we have found a blue copper protein with a copper content of 0·36 per cent. It seems very probable that this substance is identical with the haemoeuprein of Mann and Keilin5, which thus might be an integral part of the blue globulin."

It has frequently been stated1,2,3 that this sheath is composed of a network of collagenous or reticular fibrils, arranged like a knitted sock. One of us (R. B.) in an investigation to be described elsewhere has failed to find any evidence of fibrillar structure using various methods of microscopy, including phase contrast and dark-ground illumination. We have, therefore, investigated the structure of the sarcolemma by means of the electron microscope (R.C.A. console model)."

https://openalex.org/W1973073097,"I WOULD like to record some experiments made three years ago and recently repeated with a different technique. During a search for chemically defined growth-factors for M. tuberculosis, it was decided to investigate vitamin K. The role of vitamin K in bacterial metabolism has not been determined; but this vitamin is present in many organisms and is probably of nutritional importance1,2,3. Anderson has isolated from a laboratory strain of human tubercle bacillus a pigment, ‘phthiocol' (2 methyl 3 hydroxy 1 : 4 naphthoquinone), which has vitamin K-like activity4,5. It has been postulated that phthiocol is derived from vitamin K during the extraction of the bacteria6. For many years it has been known that M. paratuberculosis when freshly isolated will grow only on media containing extracts of other acid-fast bacteria, notably M. phlei. The claim has been made that phthiocol and 2 methyl 1 : 4 naphthoquinone can replace M. phlei7; but the stimulant action is not so marked, and hence it does not follow that the M. phlei growth-factor and these compounds are the same. M. tuberculosis var. hominis can also have its growth accelerated by extracts of other acid-fast bacteria, and for these reasons this investigation was undertaken. Reports in the literature on the action of phthiocol and 2 methyl naphthoquinone are not consistent8,9, but naphthoquinone derivatives have been claimed as inhibitory10. In the accompanying table compounds 1 and 2 are water-soluble synthetic vitamin K derivatives and both inhibit growth."

https://openalex.org/W2071247853,"EMPLOYING a technique which at the time was far from being perfect, we were able in 1941 to demonstrate the general importance of amino-acids in connexion with the maintenance and growth of tissue cells1. It was found that cystine occupies a key position among the amino-acids ; if absent from a diet that contains all the other amino-acids, the cells cannot be kept alive, but die within twenty-four hours. The relative significance of the other amino-acids could not at the time be tested similarly, because of the imperfection of our technique."

https://openalex.org/W2982716923,"I NOTICE with interest Dr. Howard‘s records of chromosome counts of 2n = 56 for several plants of Cardamine pratensis growing in damp places1. I have been working on British plants of this species for the last two years, with the help and guidance of Dr. K. B. Blackburn, and I have collected a very considerable amount of information on its chromosome number. The normal plant which grows in damp meadows has constantly the chromosome number 2n = 56, judged from the evidence of seventy plants collected from eighteen vice-counties. Plants with semi-double flowers, first described by Dr. Wilfred Robinson2 in 1925, have been found in fifteen localities in wet places, chiefly in the north of England. They have the same chromosome number 2n = 56. Plants with 2n = 30 chromosomes seem to be characteristically from the south of England. Those examined include five normal plants and seven completely sterile double-flowered plants. No other chromosome numbers than these have so far been encountered."

https://openalex.org/W1983238625,"THE use of 2 : 2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)-l : 1 : 1-tri-chlorethane (D.D.T.) and benzene hexachloride as soil insecticides raises the question of the length of time for which these substances will persist in soil. There is already much indirect evidence that both these substances are satisfactory in this respect ; but the possibility exists that they may suffer bacterial1 or other decomposition in soil, as do many organic compounds. So far as I am aware, this problem of persistence has not so far been the subject of direct chemical investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2034223182,"IN a recent brief review, Barber1 has directed attention to the need for incorporating results obtained from genetical and cytological studies of the algæ into the general body of genetical science. I am grateful to Prof. Barber for stimulating interest in this field of study, because most genetical work up to the present has been concerned with groups of plants having the Hofmeisterian type of life-history. It is quite unknown to what extent the algae would lend themselves to extensive genetical investigation and whether data obtained from such experiments would conform to the genetical concepts accepted to-day for the higher plants."

https://openalex.org/W2026620233,"ROWLANDS1 described the recovery of ‘rats eggs by unravelling the Fallopian tubes and squeezing out their contents under low-power magnification. Using this method he obtained an average of 4·9 ± 0·5 (standard error of the mean) ova per rat from the tubes of thirteen normal rats two days after mating2. Using the same method in forty rats killed 0–2 days after mating, we recovered a similar number of eggs (4·2 ± 0·3 per rat)."
https://openalex.org/W2988645188,"WE value the remarks of Drs. Edisbury, Taylor and Gridgeman1 on a new unit in photo-electric colorimetry2. Opinions do not seem at variance that measurements should be made at approximately the same optical density1, 2, that—provided the Beer-Lambert law be valid—the relation of the proposed unit W501 cm. to the usual E1%1 cm. can be expressed by : and that E (1%, 1 cm.) is certainly less cumbersome to print than E1%1 cm. Title and text of our letter2, however, should have made it clear that we had photo-electric colorimeters (absorptiometers) in mind. Though it was shown by Twyman and Lothian3 that 0·4343 is the best density for this type of instrument, it was also stated that ... we may use densities between 0·2 and 0·8 without any considerable loss of accuracy. This range covers easily the proposed half-value and adjacent auxiliary readings used for interpolating W501 cm,. An even wider range (0·2–1·2) is recommended elsewhere4 for an instrument other than ours. The statement1 that E (1%, 1 cm.) is merely a standard expression that does not carry the implication that one must measure the optical density of a 1 per cent solution in a 1 cm. cell may probably be correct, but not necessarily so, and does not seem to be endorsed unanimously ; for Guild5 inferred regarding accuracy in spectrophotometry that ... our terminology should be kept in as close correspondence as possible with the physical magnitudes actually handled in our experiments, strongly deprecating the use of derived magnitudes. Though the proposed half-value is inversely related to quantity, this need not impair its applicability ; for a similar magnitude, the half-value layer is a standard expression in X-ray technique6."
https://openalex.org/W1999458825,"THE true nature of Greek Fire is still wrapped in mystery and it is difficult to decide whether its use constituted chemical warfare. Chemical warfare, as We know it, was employed only in the First World War (1914-18), when mustard gas and phosgene were used and the study of their pathology was commenced. Work on the nature of these agents proceeded slowly from 1920 until 1939, when there was increased interest in poison gas. Since the Second World War ended, some of the work which was carried out for the British and American Governments has been released, or ‘‘declassified as the Americans say, and been published. The Biochemical Society arranged a symposium held at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine on some aspects of the biochemistry of these substances on December 13."
https://openalex.org/W2035025768,"CRITICS of science, whatever their motives, have not neglected, to make capital out of the destructive uses to which scientific results have been put by man; and, critics of planned research, moved no doubt by purely scientific reasons, have vigorously asserted that planning hampers and may ruin the creative abilities of scientific men. To both these groups of critics the Report of the Medical Research Council for the years 1939–45, entitled ""Medical Research in War"" (Cmd. 7335. London : H.M. Stationery Office, 1947. Pp. 1–455, 7s. 6d. net), is to be commended. For in it the former will find a long record of beneficent uses to which scientific results have actually been put ; and the latter will learn from it that planning, provided that it is wisely done by broadminded men who understand, and themselves experience, the mental processes and disciplines of scientific work, can produce both useful results and fundamental discoveries which advance the frontiers of knowledge. The proviso is a sine qua non ; for planning that fails to recognize the basic individualism of scientific men and their kinship with artists imposes fatal limitations upon the research Worker. The report is, for this reason, a tribute, not only to the men and women who have done the humane work that it records, but also to those who have, in their several ways, created and woven the themes treated, made the opportunities and provided the money and equipment without which the work could not have been accomplished."
https://openalex.org/W2044334032,"A METHOD has been described for the fractionation of human plasma in which fibrinogen is precipitated by ether, and prothrombin by adjusting the pH of the supernatant to 5·3 with 0·2 M citric acid1. The plasma remaining is frozen with excess of ether and the protein concentrated for use as a transfusion fluid2. We would like to direct attention to the fact that such solutions of proteins from citrated plasma may contain a dangerously high citrate concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2135810305,"FOR some time it has been known that two isobars which differ by unity in atomic number cannot both be stable, except for a possible influence of the neutrino if its mass has a positive value at rest. A search for radioactivity among the existing pairs of isobars led to the announcement1 of K-electron capture in osmium (Os187) with a half-life of about 3 × 108 years. However, a recent paper on beta-stability2 contains the following remark: The reported radioactivity of Os187 has recently been questioned, with indications that Re187 instead is radioactive3. It seems worth pointing out that some time ago another argument had thrown strong doubts on the view that osmium is radioactive."

https://openalex.org/W4231168689,"THE debate in the House of Commons on May 14 on the international control of atomic energy added little to what had been said earlier in the House of Lords. Mr. Mayhew, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, made it plain that the Government accepts the view that in the present circumstances no progress is possible on the Atomic Energy Commission ; but that if a solution of the atomic energy problem could be reached at all, it will be through the machinery of the United Nations. The Government has agreed to the suspension of the discussions for the time being because no effective system of international control is possible without a voluntary merging of some part of national sovereignty. Unlike ten out of the twelve nations represented on the Commission, Soviet Russia, he said, is unwilling to take this step, just as she refuses the complete openness also essential for the success of a scheme of international control."
