https://openalex.org/W2907496349,"Local translation regulates the axonal proteome, playing an important role in neuronal wiring and axon maintenance. How axonal mRNAs are localized to specific subcellular sites for translation, however, is not understood. Here we report that RNA granules associate with endosomes along the axons of retinal ganglion cells. RNA-bearing Rab7a late endosomes also associate with ribosomes, and real-time translation imaging reveals that they are sites of local protein synthesis. We show that RNA-bearing late endosomes often pause on mitochondria and that mRNAs encoding proteins for mitochondrial function are translated on Rab7a endosomes. Disruption of Rab7a function with Rab7a mutants, including those associated with Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2B neuropathy, markedly decreases axonal protein synthesis, impairs mitochondrial function, and compromises axonal viability. Our findings thus reveal that late endosomes interact with RNA granules, translation machinery, and mitochondria and suggest that they serve as sites for regulating the supply of nascent pro-survival proteins in axons."
https://openalex.org/W2907315139,"Local translation meets protein turnover and plasticity demands at synapses, however, the location of its energy supply is unknown. We found that local translation in neurons is powered by mitochondria and not by glycolysis. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that dendritic mitochondria exist as stable compartments of single or multiple filaments. To test if these mitochondrial compartments can serve as local energy supply for synaptic translation, we stimulated individual synapses to induce morphological plasticity and visualized newly synthesized proteins. Depletion of local mitochondrial compartments abolished both the plasticity and the stimulus-induced synaptic translation. These mitochondrial compartments serve as spatially confined energy reserves, as local depletion of a mitochondrial compartment did not affect synaptic translation at remote spines. The length and stability of dendritic mitochondrial compartments and the spatial functional domain were altered by cytoskeletal disruption. These results indicate that cytoskeletally tethered local energy compartments exist in dendrites to fuel local translation during synaptic plasticity."

METTL13 deletion and eEF1AK55me2 loss dramatically reduce Ras-driven neoplastic growth in mouse models and in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from primary pancreatic and lung tumors. Finally, METTL13 depletion renders PDX tumors hypersensitive to drugs that target growth-signaling pathways.

Lysine methylation is the addition of one, two, or three methyl groups to the ε-nitrogen of a lysine side chain, forming mono-, di-, and tri-methylated derivatives (referred to here as me1, me2, and me3, respectively). The chemical addition of methyl moieties to lysine residues is catalyzed by lysine methyltransferases (KMTs). Biological functions for lysine methylation is best characterized on histone proteins and the regulation of epigenetics and chromatin biology (Chi et al., 2010Chi P. Allis C.D. Wang G.G. Covalent histone modifications--miswritten, misinterpreted and mis-erased in human cancers.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Beyond histones, there is a growing appreciation that a number of non-histone proteins (e.g., p53, RB, RelA) are modulated by lysine methylation (Carlson and Gozani, 2016Carlson S.M. Gozani O. Nonhistone lysine methylation in the regulation of cancer pathways.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2016; 6 (Published online November 1, 2016)https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a026435Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the human proteome, there are predicted to be greater than 100 KMTs that belong to one of two protein methylase families: SET (Su(var)3-9, Enhancer-of-zeste, Trithorax) domain enzymes and 7βS (seven-β strand) enzymes (Clarke, 2013Clarke S.G. Protein methylation at the surface and buried deep: Thinking outside the histone box.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). All of the validated histone KMTs reside within the SET domain family with the exception of the H3K79 KMT hDOT1L, which belongs to the 7βS family. Several additional SET and 7βS enzymes methylate non-histone proteins to influence different nuclear and cytoplasmic activities; however, the biological function, catalytic activity, and substrate specificity for the majority of the large family of 7βS KMTs remain to be elucidated (Carlson and Gozani, 2016Carlson S.M. Gozani O. Nonhistone lysine methylation in the regulation of cancer pathways.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2016; 6 (Published online November 1, 2016)https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a026435Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The GTPase eEF1A (eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha) is an evolutionarily conserved and fundamental non-ribosomal component of the translational machinery and one of the most abundant proteins found in eukaryotic proteomes (Schuller and Green, 2018Schuller A.P. Green R. Roadblocks and resolutions in eukaryotic translation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19: 526-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Methylation of eEF1A occurs at several lysine residues, many of which are conserved from yeast to humans (Hamey and Wilkins, 2018Hamey J.J. Wilkins M.R. Methylation of elongation factor 1A: Where, who, and why?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2018; 43: 211-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Jakobsson et al., 2018aJakobsson M.E. Małecki J. Falnes P.O. Regulation of eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) by dynamic lysine methylation.RNA Biol. 2018; 15: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Further, it has been suggested that, akin to the extensive role histone methylation plays in chromatin regulation, eEF1A methylation may likewise regulate distinct eEF1A-mediated biology, including translation elongation. In humans, there are two eEF1A paralogs, eEF1A1 and eEF1A2, which are 90% identical and 98% similar. The expression of eEF1A1 is ubiquitous, while eEF1A2 expression is limited largely to post-mitotic cells (e.g., neurons and cardiomyocytes) (Lee and Surh, 2009Lee M.H. Surh Y.J. eEF1A2 as a putative oncogene.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2009; 1171: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, eEF1A2 expression is re-activated in cancers, and eEF1A1 levels are generally higher in neoplastic relative to normal tissues (Lee and Surh, 2009Lee M.H. Surh Y.J. eEF1A2 as a putative oncogene.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2009; 1171: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cancers that are driven by PI3K-AKT activation show increased sensitivity to eEF1A inhibitors (Lee and Surh, 2009Lee M.H. Surh Y.J. eEF1A2 as a putative oncogene.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2009; 1171: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Connections between mRNA translation and cancer are well established, whereby it is postulated that alterations in the components of the translation apparatus, including eEF1A1/2 overexpression, may be required to fuel neoplastic growth downstream of oncogenic RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling, which frequently drive lethal neoplasms including lung and pancreatic cancer (Bhat et al., 2015Bhat M. Robichaud N. Hulea L. Sonenberg N. Pelletier J. Topisirovic I. Targeting the translation machinery in cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2015; 14: 261-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, Robichaud et al., 2018Robichaud N. Sonenberg N. Ruggero D. Schneider R.J. Translational control in cancer.Cold Spring Harb.

New frontiers in translational control of the cancer genome.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 288-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Lung cancer is the most common cause of global cancer-related mortality, leading to over a million deaths each year, and lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) is the most common histological type. Most LAC cases are due to oncogenic KRAS and/or additional mutations that are to date unfortunately not clinically actionable. Pancreatic cancer is also a lethal malignancy. More than 75% of patients die within the first twelve months of diagnosis; the 5-year survival rate is below 5%. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most prevalent pancreatic cancer subtype. It typically presents at an advanced stage and is refractory to most treatment modalities. The vast majority of PDAC cases express oncogenic mutant KRAS (Almoguera et al., 1988Almoguera C. Shibata D. Forrester K. Martin J. Arnheim N. Perucho M. Most human carcinomas of the exocrine pancreas contain mutant c-K-ras genes.Cell. 1988; 53: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). Due to the lethality of LAC and PDAC, the fundamental role of the KRAS pathway, and the difficulty in directly inhibiting KRAS, drug discovery efforts have turned to inhibiting downstream kinase targets (e.g., RAF, MEK1/2, and ERK1/2) and Ras-activated pathways (e.g., PI3K). While compounds that inhibit these kinases have shown promise in cell-culture and animal experiments, clinical studies have been less encouraging due to toxicity and the development of therapy resistance (Infante et al., 2014Infante J.R. Somer B.G. Park J.O. Li C.P. Scheulen M.E. Kasubhai S.M. Oh D.Y. Liu Y. Redhu S. Steplewski K. Le N. A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of trametinib, an oral MEK inhibitor, in combination with gemcitabine for patients with untreated metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.Eur. J. Cancer. 2014; 50: 2072-2081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, there is great interest in identifying factors that cooperate with the canonical KRAS pathway to drive cancer with the hope that a therapeutic strategy hitting multiple pathways will hinder resistance development, while also mitigating toxicity by lowering the overall dose needed for each medicine. In this work, we find that di-methylation of eEF1A at lysine 55 (eEF1AK55me2) is a high stoichiometry species that is upregulated in pancreatic and lung cancers and associated with poor clinical outcomes. In a genetic screen, we identify the orphan protein METTL13 as the physiologic enzyme specifically tasked with generating eEF1AK55me2. Notably, METTL13 expression is also upregulated in cancer wherein it negatively correlates with patient survival. We demonstrate that METTL13, via eEF1AK55 methylation, regulates protein synthesis in cancer cells. Further, METTL13 depletion inhibits proliferation of several cancer cell lines and significantly reduces tumorigenesis in vivo in Ras-driven pancreatic and lung cancer mouse models and in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from human pancreatic and lung cancers. Finally, we show that METTL13 depletion markedly sensitizes cancer cells and xenograft tumors to drugs that target growth-signaling pathways. Together, our data support a model in which regulation of translation elongation by the METTL13-eEF1AK55me2 axis serves as a mechanism utilized by malignancies to adapt to their increased translational requirements. The methylation of eEF1A is conserved from yeast to humans, suggesting that, akin to histone methylation, a modification network may regulate specific eEF1A functions (Hamey and Wilkins, 2018Hamey J.J.

Sci. 2018; 43: 211-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, Jakobsson et al., 2018aJakobsson M.E. Małecki J. Falnes P.O.

While several conserved enzymes that methylate different residues on eEF1A have been identified, the KMT responsible for generating methylation of eEF1A at lysine 55 (eEF1AK55me), a modification that is present in humans but not detected in yeast, is not known (Figure 1A). We analyzed methylation of eEF1A purified from seven cell lines by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and found that >98% of eEF1A1/2 molecules harbor di-methylation at K55, with a small fraction of K55 being unmodified or bearing mono-methylation (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B). Next, we raised state-specific eEF1AK55me1-3 antibodies and found that each antibody selectively recognized its own state of methylation on eEF1A peptides (Figures 1C and S1C). In addition, the anti-eEF1AK55me2 antibody selectively recognized eEF1AK55me2 peptides, as it did not bind to 19 different peptides from other proteins that harbor a dimethyl lysine (Figure S1D).Figure S1Identification of METTL13 as a Candidate eEF1A Lysine 55 Methyltransferase, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) eEF1AK55 dimethylation is the predominant species in multiple human cell lines.

There are three independent sgRNAs targeting 107 known and candidate KMTs in the human genome. For each indicated KMT, eEF1AK55me2 and tubulin protein levels are shown in top and bottom panels, respectively and the data is organized alphabetically. To discover the enzyme that generates the eEF1AK55me2 mark, we used a gene-editing coupled biochemical screening strategy (see schematic, Figure 1D). 107 known and putative KMTs in the human genome were identified and a focused CRISPR-Cas9 knockout collection was generated consisting of 3 independent small guide RNAs (sgRNA) per KMT gene and one control sgRNA for a total of 322 sgRNAs (Table S1). The collection was used to generate 322 individual U2OS cell lines, each expressing a single sgRNA from the collection. Lysates were prepared from each individual cell line to generate a collection of 322 unique lysates, which were systematically probed with the eEF1AK55me2 antibody to determine gene(s) whose deletion results in loss of the eEF1A methylation signal (Figure 1D; for control lysate, see Figure S1E). Strikingly, out of the 107 potential KMTs that were targeted by sgRNAs, abrogating METTL13 expression was the only intervention that reduced eEF1AK55me2 signal (Figures S1E and S1F). Notably, two sgRNAs (METTL13-b and -c) reduced METTL13 protein levels, which was paralleled by a decrease in eEF1AK55me2 signal, whereas cells expressing the METTL13-a sgRNA retained METTL13 expression and failed to reduce eEF1AK55me2 signal (Figure 1E). These results suggest that out of 107 potential KMTs in the human genome, only METTL13, an uncharacterized member of the 7βS family, regulates eEF1AK55 dimethylation in U2OS cells. In in vitro methylation assays using recombinant proteins with 3H-SAM (S-adenosyl-methionine) as the methyl donor, METTL13 methylated GST-eEF1A1 and GST-eEF1A2, but not eEF1A1/2 proteins harboring a K55R substitution (Figure 2A). We also performed in vitro methylation reactions with non-radiolabeled SAM and observed METTL13 mono- and di-methylation (but not tri-methylation) of eEF1A1/2 at K55 by western blotting (Figure 2B) and LC-MS/MS (Figures S2A and S2B).Figure S2METTL13 Methylates eEF1AK55 In Vitro, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) METTL13 methylates eEF1A1/2 at K55 in vitro.

Bottom panel, Coomassie stain of proteins in the reaction. Asterisk indicates METTL13 breakdown product. METTL13 contains two putative methyltransferase (MTase) domains, one at the N terminus and one at the C terminus (top panel, Figure 2C). The N-terminal MTase 1 domain is necessary for METTL13 methylation of GST-eEF1AK55, whereas the C-terminal domain is dispensable for this activity (Figure 2C). Structure-function analysis identified residues 1–401 of METTL13 as sufficient for eEF1AK55 methylation activity, as further C-terminal deletions were not tolerated (Figure 2D). Using a combination of structural modeling (Figure S2C) and sequence homology to other 7βS KMTs (Figure S2D), we identified several specific substitutions that abrogated METTL13’s catalytic activity (Figure S2D), including G58R, which is predicted to interfere with SAM binding (Figures 2E and S2C). In addition to U2OS cells (see Figure 1E), we found that depletion of METTL13 by two independent sgRNAs (targeting exon-intron junctions and named METTL13-1 and METTL13-2) resulted in loss of eEF1AK55me2 in six additional cell lines as determined by western blotting (Figure 3A; LC-MS/MS shown in Figure S3A). Complementation of METTL13-depleted NCI-H2170 cells with CRISPR-resistant wild-type METTL13, but not the catalytic-dead METTL13G58R, restored eEF1AK55me2 levels (Figure 3B). Collectively, these results identify METTL13 as a bona fide KMT that methylates eEF1A at K55 in vitro and is required for maintenance of physiologic levels of eEF1AK55me2 in cells in a catalytic activity-dependent manner.Figure S3METTL13 Specifically Methylates eEF1AK55 in Cells, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) METTL13 is required for dimethylation of eEF1AK55 in human cell lines.

Red arrows indicate elution peaks of non-methylated eEF1AK55 peptide in the profiles. eEF1A is one of the more abundant proteins in the human proteome and K55me2 is a high-stoichiometry event (Hamey and Wilkins, 2018Hamey J.J.

Based on our screen (Figure S1F) and cellular depletion studies (Figure 3A), our data argue that METTL13 is the principal enzyme tasked with generating physiologic eEF1AK55me2. This raises the question of whether the converse is true: is eEF1AK55 the only METTL13 substrate or one of many relevant substrates? Histones are heavily methylated and there are many enzymes that function as histone KMTs (Murn and Shi, 2017Murn J. Shi Y. The winding path of protein methylation research: Milestones and new frontiers.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, in vitro, METTL13 does not methylate the four core histones (H3, H2A, H2B, and H4) or nucleosomes (Figure 3C). In addition, METTL13 does not methylate any proteins present in the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits and 80S ribosomes that lack eEF1A (Figures 3D and S3B). To investigate METTL13 catalytic specificity in a physiologic and unbiased setting, we used quantitative proteomics to compare the methylome of the PDAC cell line T3M4 ± METTL13 (Figure 3E). Of the >1,000 methylation events detected in the analysis, eEF1AK55 methylation (me1 and me2) were the only modifications quantitatively altered upon METTL13 depletion; no changes were observed in histone methylation or for other eEF1A methylated residues (Figure 3E; Table S2). Structural modeling of the METTL13 catalytic core showed a distinct substrate recognition domain (Figure S2C), which is reminiscent of PrmA, a bacterial KMT that achieves substrate s"

We compared the effects of aerobic, resistance, and a combination of both aerobic and resistance training on CVD risk factors including peripheral and central BP, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), muscular strength, body composition, blood glucose and lipids. Sixty-nine adults (58±7 years) with an elevated blood pressure or hypertension, overweight/obesity, and sedentary lifestyle were randomized to one of the three 8-week exercise programs or a non-exercise control group. Participants in all three exercise groups had an equal total exercise time, 3 days/week (aerobic: 60 minutes/session vs. resistance: 60 minutes/session vs. combination: aerobic 30 minutes/session plus resistance 30 minutes/session). Combined training provided significant reductions in peripheral (-4 mmHg) and central diastolic BP (-4 mmHg), increase in CRF (4.9 ml/kg/min), increase in upper (4 kg) and lower (11 kg) body strength, and increase in lean body mass (0.8 kg) (p <0.05). Aerobic training only increased CRF (7.7 ml/kg/min), and reduced body weight (-1.0 kg) and fat mass (-0.9 kg) (p <0.05). Resistance training only increased lower body strength (13 kg) and reduced waist circumference (-1.7 cm) (p <0.05). However, neither aerobic or resistance training alone showed significant reductions in BP (p>0.05). Furthermore, a composite score of CVD risk factors indicated a greater reduction with combination training compared to the control group. In conclusion, among individuals at an increased risk for CVD, as little as 8-weeks of combined training may provide more comprehensive CVD benefits compared to time-matched aerobic or resistance training alone."
https://openalex.org/W2907114967,"Non-traumatic headaches account for 0.5 to 4.5% at the emergency department (ED). Although primary headaches represent the most common causes, the likelihood of ominous etiology has to be considered by clinicians in order to avoid diagnostic and therapeutic pitfalls. Due to the absence of biological or imaging findings to diagnose primary headaches we hypothesize ICHD 3(International Headache criteria 3) criteria as a useful tool at the moment to identify and to establish a difference between those patients who are undergoing primary headaches and those who will need advanced diagnostic strategies.To determine the usefulness of ICHD 3 criteria to differentiate primary from non-primary headaches at the emergency department (ED).During five weeks all the patients complaining of headache attended at the triage unit at the ED were interviewed, examined and classified as having primary or non-primary headaches by means of ICHD 3 criteria. Those patients with primary headaches were treated according to standard of care protocols and followed up by means of phone call communication after 48 hours to assure satisfactory outcome. Those patients classified as having non-primary headaches (secondary headaches and neuralgias) were admitted for additional diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Between both groups we compared the prevalence of fulfilled criteria for primary headaches and the proportion of traditional red flags such as age, sleep headache onset, associated symptoms, abnormal neurological exam, sudden onset, and nonresponse to analgesics in addition to previous consultation before this evaluation.Headache was responsible for 244 (2.3%) out of 10450 admissions at the ED, 77.8% were females. Primary, non-primary (secondary plus neuralgias) and unclassified headaches were 59.4%, 32% and 8.6% respectively. Migraine and cervical myofascial pain were the most frequent etiologies for primary and non-primary causes respectively. Factors associated to non-primary etiologies were immunosuppression (OR: 2.7 IC 95% 2.3-3.3) and age older than 50 (OR: 2.7 IC 95% 2.01-3.62). Abnormal neurological exam, sudden and sleep headache onset were not statistically significant. Factors found to be associated with primary headaches were: fulfilling ICHD 3 criteria (OR: 18.7, IC95% 7.1-48.6), history of migraine (OR: 2.9 IC 95% 2.1-3.9), and history of similar episodes (OR: 2.7 IC 95% 2.3-3.3).This data suggests that fulfilling ICHD 3 criteria could be useful to differentiate primary from non-primary headaches. This observation is also valid for immunosuppression, age older than 50, history of migraine and history of similar episodes."

Although GBS can discover millions of SNPs, a high rate of missing data is a major concern for many applications. Accurate imputation of those missing data can significantly improve the utility of GBS data. This study compared imputation accuracies among four genome references including three wheat references (Chinese Spring survey sequence, W7984, and IWGSC RefSeq v1.0) and one barley reference genome by comparing imputed data derived from low-depth sequencing to actual data from high-depth sequencing. After imputation, the average number of imputed data points was the highest in the B genome (~48.99%). The D genome had the lowest imputed data points (~15.02%) but the highest imputation accuracy. Among the four reference genomes, IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 reference provided the most imputed data points, but the lowest imputation accuracy for the SNPs with < 10% minor allele frequency (MAF). The W7984 reference, however, provided the highest imputation accuracy for the SNPs with < 10% MAF."
https://openalex.org/W2910625787,"The objective of this study was to characterize the normal microbiome of healthy canine vagina and endometrium and to determine the effect of the stage of estrous, on the resident microbiome. Cranial vaginal swabs and uterine biopsy samples were collected from twenty-five bitches in five different stages of estrous at elective ovariohysterectomy (OVH). Over 4 million reads of the V4 region of 16S rDNA gene were obtained and used for further analyses. A total of 317 genera belonging to 24 known phyla were identified. The endometrium was higher in bacterial diversity while the vagina was higher in richness. Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the most abundant phyla observed across all samples. Hydrotalea, Ralstonia, and Fusobacterium accounted for nearly 60% of the OTUs identified in the vagina while organisms identified in the endometrium were more evenly distributed. Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, and Corynebacterium were the prominent genera in the endometrium. The microbiome of the endometrium was distinctly different from that of the vagina. There was large animal-to-animal variation. Other than the vaginal microbiome of bitches in estrus (i.e. in heat), there were no distinct clustering of the organisms based on the stage of estrous. These findings establish the presence of a resident microbiome of the endometrium throughout all stages of estrous cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2910988738,"Introduction Nutritional anemia is a major public health problem throughout the world, particularly in developing countries. Iron with folic acid supplementation (IFAS) is recommended to mitigate anemia and its resulting complications during pregnancy. There has been limited study on IFAS adherence of pregnant women in the study area. The aim of this study was to assess adherence to IFAS and its associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal care service in Debre Tabor General Hospital, Ethiopia. Methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 9 to April 8, 2017, at Debre Tabor General Hospital. A total of 262 study participants were included and selected by systematic random sampling. The entire interviewed questionnaire was checked and entered into EpiData version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS version 20 for windows for analysis. IFAS adherence status was defined as, if pregnant mothers took 65% or more of the IFAS which is equivalent to taking IFAS at least 4 days a week during the 1-month period preceding the study. Regressions were fitted to identify independent predictors of IFAS adherence. A P-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance. Results A total of 241 pregnant women were included (92% response rate), of which 107 (44%) were adherent to IFAS. Only 39% received IFAS counseling, and 52% had some knowledge of IFAS. Gravidity (AOR = 2.92 95% CI (1.61, 5.30)), gestational age at first ANC visit (AOR = 3.67, 95% CI (1.94, 6.97)), pregnant women who got advice about IFAS (AOR = 2.04, 95%CI (1.12, 3.75)), current anemia (AOR = 2.22, 95%CI (1.45, 4.29)), and had knowledge about IFAS (AOR = 3.27, 95% CI (1.80, 5.95)) were statistically associated with adherence to IFAS among pregnant women. Conclusion Overall, IFAS adherence among pregnant women was low. The associated factors with adherence of IFAS were counseling and knowledge, early ANC attendance, pregnancy history, and current anemia diagnosis. IFAS counseling by health workers was low but, when given, was associated with improved IFAS adherence. Health workers and health extension workers should consistently counsel on IFAS benefits during ANC visit, to improve IFAS adherence during the current and subsequent pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W2910525943,"Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) is an important enzyme in hepatic phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis. Pemt−/− mice fed a high-fat diet are protected from obesity and whole-body insulin resistance. However, Pemt−/− mice develop severe nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Because NASH is often associated with hepatic insulin resistance, we investigated whether the increased insulin sensitivity in Pemt−/− mice was restricted to nonhepatic tissues or whether the liver was also insulin sensitive. Strikingly, the livers of Pemt−/− mice compared with those of Pemt+/+ mice were not insulin resistant, despite elevated levels of hepatic triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols, as well as increased hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Endogenous glucose production was lower in Pemt−/− mice under both basal and hyperinsulinemic conditions. Experiments in primary hepatocytes and hepatoma cells revealed improved insulin signaling in the absence of PEMT, which was not due to changes in diacylglycerols, ceramides, or gangliosides. On the other hand, the phospholipid composition in hepatocytes seems critically important for insulin signaling such that lowering the PC:phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ratio improves insulin signaling. Thus, treatments to reduce the PC:PE ratio in liver may protect against the development of hepatic insulin resistance.—Van der Veen, J. N., Lingrell, S., McCloskey, N., LeBlond, N.

https://openalex.org/W2909914041,"Various endocrine factors contribute to cold-induced white adipose tissue (WAT) browning, but glucagon has largely been ignored. The purpose of the current investigation was to determine if glucagon was required for the effects of cold on WAT browning. Utilizing whole-body glucagon receptor knockout (Gcgr−/−) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermate controls, we examined the response of inguinal WAT (iWAT) and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) to an acute (48 h) cold stress or challenge with the β3-adrenergic agonist CL316,243. The effects of glucagon alone on the induction of thermogenic genes in adipose tissue from C57BL6/J mice were also examined. Gcgr−/− mice displayed modest increases in indices of browning at room temperature while displaying a blunted induction of Ucp1, Cidea, and Ffg21 mRNA expression in iWAT following cold exposure. Similarly, cold induced increases in mitochondrial DNA copy number, and the protein content of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes, UCP1, and PGC1α were attenuated in iWAT from Gcgr−/− mice. In BAT, the induction of thermogenic markers following cold exposure was reduced, but the effect was less pronounced than in iWAT. Glucagon treatment increased the expression of thermogenic genes in both iWAT and BAT of C57BL6/J mice. In response to CL316,243, circulating fatty acids, glycerol, and the phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase were attenuated in iWAT of Gcgr−/− mice. We provide evidence that glucagon is sufficient for the induction of thermogenic genes in iWAT, and the absence of intact glucagon signaling blunts the cold-induced browning of WAT, possibly due, in part, to impaired adrenergic signaling.—Townsend, L.

https://openalex.org/W2910626228,"Purpose To characterize the biophysical properties of an artificial vitreous body substitute (VBS), which consists of a biocompatible, cross-linked, hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel, by analysing the VBS’s influence on intraocular pressure (IOP) and retinal integrity in distinct ex vivo eye models in order to evaluate the its potential for in vivo biocompatibility testing. Methods Pig eyes were obtained immediately postmortem, and VBS was injected after core-vitrectomy. IOP was followed for 24 h (n = 5). VBS influence on retinal integrity was investigated using isolated bovine retinas superfused with an oxygen saturated nutrient solution. An electroretinogram (ERG) was recorded on explanted bovine retinae using silver/silver chloride electrodes; after application of VBS for 2 min, a washout period of 70 min was employed. The percentage of a-and b-wave reduction at the end of the washout phase was compared to baseline values (n = 5). Data were calculated throughout as the mean and the standard deviation. qRT-PCR (Bax/Bcl–2-ratio, GFAP- and PGP9.5-levels) or western blot analysis was used to test for toxicity of Princess Volume after 24 h (and β-3 tubulin with GAPDH as a control gene). Significance was estimated by Student´s t-test; p ≤0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results The IOP increased non-significantly by 10% after 24 h. Short-term biocompatibility testing using isolated superfused bovine retinas showed neither significant reductions of the b-wave nor the a-wave amplitudes (b-wave reduction 14.2%, p>0.05; a-wave reduction 23.9%, p>0.05). qRT-PCR and western blot analysis did not reveal significant toxicity after 24 h. Conclusions The manufactured HA-based hydrogel showed highly favourable biophysical characteristics in the explored ex vivo models, justifying in vivo studies enabling the assessment of biocompatibility."

There is little empirical data on the process of and aims for selecting (lay) PPI participants, and to what extend they can and should be representative of the population at large. To explore practices and perceptions on these issues and on future PPI conduct more generally, we sent an electronic survey to authors who published involvement activities as part of their studies in medical and social science journals. We identified such authors with a systematic search of five databases and applied descriptive statistics for analysis. Of those who returned the survey (n = 127 of 315; 40%), most had previously conducted involvement activities (73%). 45% reported more than one type of involvement, e.g. consultation and deliberation and participation (14%) and to have recruited more than one type of participant for their PPI activity (56%), e.g. ‘lay publics’ and ‘expert publics’ (33% of 71). Representativeness was often seen as a crucial objective when selecting PPI participants, while less than half found it very easy (9%) or rather easy (34%) to select participants. Many respondents considered achieving good representativeness difficult (52%) or very difficult (17%). They identified significant respective challenges and desired more guidance on various aspects of planning and conducting PPI (56%). 55% thought that the concept of “involvement” should be changed or improved. We conclude that recruiting lay people for PPI activities and deciding about and handling representativeness are controversial in current PPI practice, given the manifold challenges mentioned by the survey respondents. Our findings may inform further research particularly regarding–the potentially many cases of–unpublished PPI."

With its recent demonstration in the Gram positive industrial workhorse Bacillus subtilis, this tool has become an attractive option for rapid, markerless strain engineering of industrial production hosts. Previously described strategies for CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in B. subtilis have involved chromosomal integrations of Cas9 and single guide RNA expression cassettes, or construction of large plasmids for simultaneous transformation of both single guide RNA and donor DNA. Here we use a flexible, co-transformation approach where the single guide RNA is inserted in a plasmid for Cas9 co-expression, and the donor DNA is supplied as a linear PCR product observing an editing efficiency of 76%. This allowed multiple, rapid rounds of in situ editing of the subtilisin E gene to incorporate a salt bridge triad present in the Bacillus clausii thermotolerant homolog, M-protease. A novel subtilisin E variant was obtained with increased thermotolerance and activity."
https://openalex.org/W2950272325,"Evidence shows that selective attention to visual stimuli modulates the gain of cochlear responses, probably through auditory-cortex descending pathways. At the cerebral cortex level, amplitude and phase changes of neural oscillations have been proposed as a correlate of selective attention. However, whether sensory receptors are also influenced by the oscillatory network during attention tasks remains unknown. Here, we searched for oscillatory attention-related activity at the cochlear receptor level in humans. We used an alternating visual/auditory selective attention task and measured electroencephalographic activity simultaneously to distortion product otoacoustic emissions (a measure of cochlear receptor-cell activity). In order to search for cochlear oscillatory activity, the otoacoustic emission signal, was included as an additional channel in the electroencephalogram analyses. This method allowed us to evaluate dynamic changes in cochlear oscillations within the same range of frequencies (1-35 Hz) in which cognitive effects are commonly observed in electroencephalogram works. We found the presence of low frequency (<10 Hz) brain and cochlear amplifier oscillations during selective attention to visual and auditory stimuli. Notably, switching between auditory and visual attention modulates the amplitude and the temporal order of brain and inner ear oscillations. These results extend the role of the oscillatory activity network during cognition in neural systems to the receptor level."
https://openalex.org/W2950786591,"Peiminine is a compound isolated from Bolbostemma paniculatum (Maxim) Franquet (Cucurbitaceae family), which has demonstrated antitumor activities. But its precise molecular mechanism underlying antitumor activity remain elusive. In this study, peiminine-induced apoptosis towards human hepatocellular carcinoma and its molecular mechanism were investigated. MTT assay was employed to assess anticancer effects of peiminine upon Hela, HepG2, SW480 and MCF-7 cell lines. Nuclear staining and flow cytometry were carried out to detect apoptosis induced by peiminine. Mitochondrial membrane potential evaluation and Western blot analysis were performed to investigate the mechanism of peiminine-induced apoptosis. The results showed peiminine reduced the viability of HepG2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner and had an IC50 of 4.58 μg/mL at 24h. Peiminine significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells and the mitochondrial membrane potential dose-dependently in HepG2 cells. The results of Western blotting indicated the expressions of Bcl-2, procaspase-3, procaspase-8, procaspase-9, and PARP decreased in HepG2 cells treated with peiminine, while the expressions of Bax, caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and cleaved PARP1 increased. The result suggests that peiminine can induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells through both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways."

We also, evaluated the organism’s association with other intestinal parasites. Parasite screening was performed on 756 patients, from different geographical origins (namely, Italians, Africans, South Americans, Asian and non-Italian Europeans) in which Italians represented the largest group. Blastocystis was seen to be the most prevalent parasite in the study. Subtype 3 and 1 were the most frequently found in the Italians and Africans. Our data confirmed previous studies performed in Italy, in which ST3 proved to be the most prevalent subtype, but we highlighted also a high frequency of mixed subtypes, which were probably underestimated in former analyses. Interestingly, the mixed subtypes group was the most prevalent in all the analysed geographical areas. About half of our cases showed other co-infecting parasites and the most frequent was Dientamoeba fragilis. Our study confirms that, in Blastocystis infection, multiple subtypes and co-infecting parasites are very frequently present, in particular Dientamoeba fragilis."

It has been suggested that a proportion of stillbirth cases is caused by heart disease, mainly channelopathies. The aim of this study was to analyze DNA from 290 stillbirth cases without chromosomal abnormalities for pathogenic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 70 genes associated with cardiac channelopathies and cardiomyopathies. The HaloPlex Target Enrichment System (Agilent Technologies) was utilized to prepare sequencing libraries which were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq platform. We found that 12.1% of the 290 investigated stillbirth cases had one (n = 31) or two (n = 4) variants with evidence supporting pathogenicity, i.e. loss-of-function variants (nonsense, frameshift, splice site substitutions), evidence from functional studies, or previous identification of the variants in affected individuals. Regarding identified putative pathogenic variants in genes associated with channelopathies, the prevalence was significantly higher in the stillbirth cohort (n = 23, 7.93%) than the corresponding prevalence of the same variants in the non-Finnish European population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (2.70%, p<0.001) and SweGen, (2.30%, p<0.001). Our results give further support to the hypothesis that cardiac channelopathies might contribute to stillbirth. Screening for pathogenic SNVs in genes associated with heart disease might be a valuable complement for stillbirth cases where today’s conventional investigation does not reveal the underlying cause of fetal demise."
https://openalex.org/W2953001015,"One of the most popular techniques in zebrafish research is microinjection. This is a rapid and efficient way to genetically manipulate early developing embryos, and to introduce microbes, chemical compounds, nanoparticles or tracers at larval stages. Here we demonstrate the development of a machine learning software that allows for microinjection at a trained target site in zebrafish eggs at unprecedented speed. The software is based on the open-source deep-learning library Inception v3. In a first step, the software distinguishes wells containing embryos at one-cell stage from wells to be skipped with an accuracy of 93%. A second step was developed to pinpoint the injection site. Deep learning allows to predict this location on average within 42 μm to manually annotated sites. Using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), both steps together take less than 100 milliseconds. We first tested our system by injecting a morpholino into the middle of the yolk and found that the automated injection efficiency is as efficient as manual injection (~ 80%). Next, we tested both CRISPR/Cas9 and DNA construct injections into the zygote and obtained a comparable efficiency to that of an experienced experimentalist. Combined with a higher throughput, this results in a higher yield. Hence, the automated injection of CRISPR/Cas9 will allow high-throughput applications to knock out and knock in relevant genes to study their mechanisms or pathways of interest in diverse areas of biomedical research."
https://openalex.org/W2908947190,"The expansion of black mangrove Avicennia germinans into historically smooth cordgrass Spartina alterniflora-dominated marshes with warming temperatures heralds the migration of the marsh-mangrove ecotone northward in the northern Gulf of Mexico. With this shift, A. germinans is expected to outcompete S. alterniflora where it is able to establish, offering another prevalent food source to first order consumers. In this study, we find A. germinans leaves to be preferable to chewing herbivores, but simultaneously, chewing herbivores cause more damage to S. alterniflora leaves. Despite higher nitrogen content, A. germinans leaves decomposed slower than S. alterniflora leaves, perhaps due to other leaf constituents or a different microbial community. Other studies have found the opposite in decomposition rates of the two species’ leaf tissue. This study provides insights into basic trophic process, herbivory and decomposition, at the initial stages of black mangrove colonization into S. alterniflora salt marsh."

Here, the wind- and rainfall areas were defined as the regions where wind speeds and precipitation rates exceed 14 m s-1 and 80 mm day-1 within 1000 km from the TC center, respectively. In general, TCs show significantly asymmetric wind and rainfall structures, with strong vertical wind shear appearing over South Korea during the landfall period. The rainfall area significantly increases with environmental vertical wind shear while the wind area is not sensitive to it. Composite analyses of the cases of strong and weak vertical wind shear confirm that the increase of rainfall area is related to the asymmetric convection (rising/sinking motion in the downshear-left/upshear-right side) induced by the vertical wind shear. This work highlights the importance of local atmospheric environment in determining the area primarily affected by strong winds or heavy rainfall during TC landfalls."
https://openalex.org/W2908882978,"GABAA receptors (GABAA-Rs) play critical roles in brain development and synchronization of neural network activity. While synaptic GABAA-Rs can exert rapid inhibition, the extrasynaptic GABAA-Rs can tonically inhibit neuronal activity due to constant activation by ambient GABA. The δ subunit-containing GABAA-Rs are expressed abundantly in the cerebellum, hippocampus and thalamus to mediate the major tonic inhibition in the brain. While electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of the δ-GABAA-Rs have been well characterized, the molecular interacting partners of the δ-GABAA-Rs are not clearly defined. Here, using a yeast two-hybrid screening assay, we identified transthyretin (TTR) as a novel regulatory molecule for the δ-GABAA-Rs. Knockdown of TTR in cultured cerebellar granule neurons significantly decreased the δ receptor expression; whereas overexpressing TTR in cortical neurons increased the δ receptor expression. Electrophysiological analysis confirmed that knockdown or overexpression of TTR in cultured neurons resulted in a corresponding decrease or increase of tonic currents. Furthermore, in vivo analysis of TTR-/- mice revealed a significant decrease of the surface expression of the δ-GABAA-Rs in cerebellar granule neurons. Together, our studies identified TTR as a novel regulator of the δ-GABAA-Rs."
https://openalex.org/W2949217014,"The nonspecific divalent cation channel TRPM7 (transient receptor potential-melastatin-like 7) is involved in many Ca2+ and Mg2+-dependent cellular processes, including survival, proliferation and migration. TRPM7 expression predicts metastasis and recurrence in breast cancer and several other cancers. In cultured cells, it can induce an invasive phenotype by promoting Ca2+-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition. We previously showed that in neuroblastoma cells that overexpress TRPM7 moderately, stimulation with Ca2+-mobilizing agonists leads to a characteristic sustained influx of Ca2+. Here we report that sustained influx through TRPM7 is abruptly abrogated by elevating intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Using pharmacological inhibitors and overexpression studies we show that this blockage is mediated by the cAMP effector Protein Kinase A (PKA). Mutational analysis demonstrates that the Serine residue S1269, which is present proximal to the coiled-coil domain within the protein c-terminus, is responsible for sensitivity to cAMP."

Facilities were considered to have a high readiness to provide management of chronic respiratory diseases if they scored at least half (≥50%) of the indicators listed in each of the three domains (staff training and guideline, equipment, and basic medicines) as identified by World Health Organization-Service Availability and Readiness Assessment manual. Descriptive, unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses were performed. A P value < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance.Out of 723 facilities included in this analysis, approximately one-tenth had a high readiness to provide management of chronic respiratory diseases. Less than 10% of the facilities had at least one staff who received training for management of chronic respiratory diseases. In an adjusted model, privately owned facilities [AOR = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.5-7.5], hospitals [AOR = 11.6; 95% CI, 5.0-27.2], health centres [AOR = 5.0; 95% CI, 2.4-10.7], and performance of routine management meeting [AOR = 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4-7.8] were significantly associated with high readiness to provide management for chronic respiratory diseases.Majority of Tanzanian health facilities have low readiness to provide management for chronic respiratory diseases. There is a need for the Tanzanian government to increase the availability of diagnostic equipment, medication, and to provide refresher training specifically in the lower-level and public health facilities for better management of chronic respiratory diseases and other non-communicable diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2910707726,"Background Beta-lactams are the mainstay for treating methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections complicated by bacteremia due to superior outcomes compared with vancomycin. With approximately 11% of inpatients reporting a penicillin (PCN) allergy, many patients receive suboptimal treatment for MSSA bacteremia. Objective Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of penicillin skin testing (PST) in adult patients with self-reported PCN allergy in an inpatient setting undergoing treatment for MSSA bacteremia. Methods A decision analytic model was developed comparing an acute care PST intervention to a scenario with no confirmatory allergy testing. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) from the health-sector perspective over a 1-year time horizon using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as the measure for effectiveness. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the ICER estimation. Results Over a 1-year time horizon, PST services applied to all MSSA bacteremia patients reporting a PCN-allergy would result in a cost per patient of $12,559 and 0.73 QALYs while no PST services would have a higher cost per patient of $13,219 and 0.66 QALYs per patient. This resulted in a cost-effectiveness estimate of -$9,429 per QALY gained. Varying the cost of implementing PST services determined a break-even point of $959.98 where any PST cost less than this amount would actually be cost saving. Conclusions Patients reporting a PCN allergy on admission may receive sub-optimal alternative therapies to beta-lactams, such as vancomycin, for MSSA bacteremia. This economic analysis demonstrates that inpatient PST services confirming PCN allergy are cost-effective for patients with MSSA bacteremia."
https://openalex.org/W2910788267,"Objectives Post-chemoradiotherapy (CRT) FDG PET is a useful prognosticator of esophageal cancer. However, debate on the diverse criteria of previous publications preclude worldwide multicenter comparisons, and even a universal practice guide. We aimed to validate a simple qualitative interpretation criterion of post-CRT FDG PET for outcome stratification and compare it with other criteria. Methods The post-CRT FDG PET of 114 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were independently interpreted using a qualitative 4-point scale (Qual4PS) that identified focal esophageal FDG uptake greater than liver uptake as residual tumor. Cohen’s κ coefficient (κ) was used to measure interobserver agreement of Qual4PS. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used for survival analysis. Other criteria included a different qualitative approach (QualBK), maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax3.4, SUVmax2.5), relative change of SUVmax between pre- and post-CRT FDG PET (ΔSUVmax), mean standardized uptake values (SUVmean), metabolic volume (MV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG). Results Overall interobserver agreement on the Qual4PS criterion was excellent (κ: 0.95). Except the QualBK, SUVmax2.5, and TLG, all the other criteria were significant predictors for overall survival (OS). Multivariable analysis showed only Qual4PS (HR: 15.41; P = 0.005) and AJCC stage (HR: 2.47; P = 0.007) were significant independent variables. The 2-year OS rates of Qual4PS(‒) patients undergoing CRT alone (68.4%) and patients undergoing trimodality therapy (62.5%) were not significant different, but the 2-year OS rates of Qual4PS(+) patients undergoing CRT alone (10.0%) were significantly lower than in patients undergoing trimodality therapy (42.1%). Conclusions The Qual4PS criterion is reproducible for assessing the response of ESCC to CRT, and valuable for predicting survival. It may add value to response-adapted treatment for ESCC patients, and help to decide whether surgery is warranted after CRT."
https://openalex.org/W2909535350,"Older adults suffering from hypertension form firm medication beliefs through lifetime medication management, which significantly affect their medication adherence and treatment outcomes. Understanding whether the patient-physician communication has the potential to change medication beliefs will help design an effective communication strategy to foster favorable medication beliefs. This study aims to determine whether the patient-physician communication is associated with medication beliefs among older adults with hypertension and controls socio-demographics and clinical characteristics. Further, it examines how the association varies with two different types of medication beliefs (medication overuse and harm) for each domain of communication (informative and interpersonal). A self-administered cross-sectional survey was conducted for members of seven senior centers in a metropolitan area of the United States between August and December of 2013. A total of 211 senior members suffering from hypertension completed the questionnaire, which included the Primary Care Assessment Survey (PCAS) and the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ). The former had two domains of patient-physician communication-informative and interpersonal-while the latter measured medication harm and overuse beliefs. Interpersonal patient-physician communication significantly explained the medication overuse beliefs (β = -0.28, p < 0.05), whereas neither interpersonal nor informative communication significantly explained the medication harm beliefs. Females (β = 1.29, p < 0.01) and participants with higher education (β = 2.66, p = 0.02) more strongly believed that medications are overprescribed. However, participants with low income more strongly believed that medications are harmful. Patient-physician communication, if it touches upon interpersonal aspects, has the potential to change medication overuse beliefs among older adults with hypertension. Identification of the significant factors which affect medication beliefs, will inform the design of a patient-centric communication program that fosters favorable medication beliefs among geriatric hypertensive patients."
https://openalex.org/W2910060450,"This study aimed to establish a protocol for in vitro embryo production using epididymal sperm (EP). Samples were obtained from ejaculated sperm (EJ) and the epididymis of 7 Gir bulls. First, the effect of heparin (+) on the viability, longevity (Experiment 1) and fertilization rates (Experiment 2) of the EP was evaluated. In experiment 2, a pool of EP and EJ sperm (n = 7) was coincubated with cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) for 0, 3, 6, 12 and 18 h, and the fertilization rate (FR) was evaluated. A third experiment was performed to test sperm treatments for IVP using the Percoll (P) or PureSperm (PS) gradients or a spTALP wash for sperm selection. Cleavage, blastocyst rate (BR) and embryo sex were evaluated. In experiment 4, embryos were produced using 6, 12, and 18 h of sperm-oocyte coincubation. The cleavage, BR, and total number and percentage of apoptotic cells were determined. Heparin affected EP viability, longevity and FR. After 6 h, 82% of the oocytes were fertilized in the EP+ group, a higher value (P<0.05) than that in the EJ (19%) and EP- (42%) groups. At 12 and 18 h, FR remained higher in the EP+ group, and a gradual increase in polyspermy was observed. The use of a P or PS gradient yielded a similar BR on D7 (54% and 52%), which was higher than the rate obtained using the washing method (37%). The embryos produced by EP and selected in a P or PS gradient resulted in a sex deviation in favor of male embryos (P>0.05). No differences (P>0.05) were observed among the groups that were coincubated for 6, 12 and 18 h with respect to embryo production, kinetics of development, total cell number and percentage of apoptotic cells. In conclusion, IVF time can be reduced to 6 h without affecting embryo production and quality. In addition, EP sperm selection can be performed by either a PS or P gradient."
https://openalex.org/W2910348044,"Background Learning self-efficacy, defined as learners’ confidence in their capability to learn specific subjects, is crucial for the enhancement of academic progress, because it is positively correlated with academic achievements and effective learning strategy use. In this study, we developed a universal scale called the Learning Self-Efficacy Scale (L-SES) for Clinical Skills for undergraduate medical students and validated it through item analysis and content validity index (CVI) calculation. Design The L-SES was developed based on the framework of Bloom’s taxonomy, and the questions were generated through expert consensus and CVI calculation. A pilot version of the L-SES was administered to 235 medical students attending a basic clinical skills course. The collected data were then examined through item analysis. Results The first draft of the L-SES comprised 15 questions. After expert consensus and CVI calculation, 3 questions were eliminated; hence, the pilot version comprised 12 questions. The CVI values of the 12 questions were between .88 and 1, indicating high content validity. Moreover, the item analysis indicated that the quality of L-SES reached the qualified threshold. The results showed that the L-SES scores were unaffected by gender (t = −0.049; 95% confidence interval [−.115, .109], p > .05). Conclusion The L-SES is a short, well-developed scale that can serve as a generic assessment tool for measuring medical students’ learning self-efficacy for clinical skills. Moreover, the L-SES is unaffected by gender differences. However, additional analyses in relevant educational settings are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2908998705,"To investigate the mediating effects of normative beliefs of drug use on the effects of the #Tamojunto school-based prevention program (Unplugged).Secondary analysis of a cluster randomized controlled trial.Brazil. Participants: A total of 6,391 adolescents (12.68 y.o) from 72 public schools in 6 Brazilian cities. Intervention: Schools were assigned to an experimental condition (#Tamojunto curriculum) or a control condition (no prevention program). Measurements: Baseline data were collected prior to program implementation, and follow-up data were collected 9 and 21 months later. The substances examined were alcohol (including binge drinking), tobacco, marijuana and inhalants. Five in-parallel mediation models evaluated whether the positive and negative beliefs were mediators of the likely effects of the intervention on drug use.Lack of evidences regarding differences in normative beliefs or drug use were found between the intervention and control groups. However, there was a clear association between negative drug beliefs and lower consumption (i.e. OR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.70; 0.87, for cannabis use) as well as between positive drug beliefs and higher consumption (i.e. OR = 1.77; 95% CI 1.56; 2.02, for cannabis use) independent of the assigned group.These results suggest that there is a lack of evidence that the program impact the normative beliefs, as proposed by the theoretical model of the program, suggesting that modifications are needed to produce the intended effect of the program. Negative normative beliefs seem to be a potential protective factor for drug use, but the program's effect itself on drug use via normative beliefs was not found to be statistically significant. Program activities intended to affect normative beliefs should be improved."
https://openalex.org/W2911083382,"Gout is independently associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) might be beneficial in lowering the risks of T2DM. Therefore, we conducted a nested case-control study to evaluate the associations between ULT and T2DM.This study retrieved the data of 29,765 gout patients from the period of 1998-2010 by using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Controls (n = 59,530) were matched at a 1:2 ratio by age, sex, and region. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression were performed to examine the dose-dependent relationship between ULT and T2DM.The adjusted Hazard ratio (HR) for the association of T2DM with allopurinol or benzbromarone exposure was 1.17 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.28) and1.09 (95% CI 1.03-1.15), respectively. The HR for the cumulative allopurinol dose was 0.87 (95% CI 0.71-1.07) for patients with dose ≤1.3 mg/day and was 1.31 (95% CI 1.13-1.52) for those with a dose >15.2 mg/day. Similarly, the HR for the cumulative benzbromarone dose was 0.85(95% CI 0.75-0.96) for patients with a dose ≤1.3 mg/day and 1.42 (95% CI 1.30-1.55) for patients with a dose>9.4 mg/day, respectively. Moreover, the average exposure dose of >100 mg/day for allopurinol and >100 mg/day for benzbromarone was associated with a 1.28-fold (95% CI 1.11-1.48) and 1.47-fold (95% CI 1.23-1.76) T2DM risk respectively. The HR for patients in aged >50 years group with cumulative dose ≤1.3 mg/day of allopurinol or benzbromarone had lower risk of T2DM (HR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.58-0.94 for allopurinol; HR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.90 for benzbromarone).Gout patients with prolonged ULT and a high dose of ULT were associated with a significant increase in T2DM risk. Although gout patients with age greater than 50 years and a lower dose of ULT may be beneficial in lowering T2DM risk, further clinical studies need to be confirmed these associations."
https://openalex.org/W2908786130,"Background Pregnancy is a critical time for fetal development, and education of women regarding healthy lifestyle choices is an important function for prenatal care providers, those that provide care to women during pregnancy. Within Canada, women choose to receive pregnancy care from one of a variety of publicly funded care providers. This study examines the association between the type of care provider(s) seen during pregnancy and the provision of advice related to nutrition, weight management and substance abuse. Methods Using data from the Alberta-based All Our Families prospective pregnancy cohort, we conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to determine the likelihood of receiving advice related to nutrition, weight management, and substance abuse across provider(s) seen. Results Of 3341 women in our sample, 38% saw a single provider during pregnancy and 56% received care from multiple providers. Advice on nutrition was more likely to be provided across all providers, while weight management and substance abuse was less frequently and less consistently discussed. Relative to doctors in low-risk maternity clinics, midwives were most likely to provide nutrition (OR: 3.09, 95% CI: 1.19–8.01) and weight management (OR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.13–3.50) advice to women. Conclusion Findings suggest that the type of prenatal advice received by women depends on the provider(s) seen during pregnancy. Substance abuse was least likely to be discussed across providers, suggesting important implications given recent cannabis legalization."
https://openalex.org/W2909224139,"Aim Arteriosclerotic disease is increasing due to aging of the population, and is associated with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and smoking. This disease may result in fatal cerebrovascular disease, and especially cardiogenic cerebral embolism caused by artery plaque-based atherothrombotic cerebral infarction. The study was performed to examine the relationship of abdominal aortic calcification (AAC) on lumbar radiographs with carotid intima-media complex thickness (IMT), factors associated with carotid artery plaque, and cutoff values in middle-aged and elderly people. Patients and methods The subjects were 309 healthy volunteers (average age 63 years) who attended a health checkup supported by a local government in 2015. The AAC-24 score was determined on lumbar lateral standing radiographs and was categorized as 0 (54% of subjects),1–4 (31%), and ≥5 (severe, 15%). Carotid ultrasonography was used to evaluate IMT of the common carotid artery. Carotid artery plaque was defined as IMT >1.1 mm. Body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, smoking, alcohol intake, and osteoporosis were examined. Results Of 309 cases, 142 (46%) had AAC and 104 (34%) had carotid artery plaque. Thus, 15% (n = 45) had severe AAC. Age, prevalence of DM and carotid artery plaque increased with severity of AAC. In patients with carotid artery plaque (n = 104), age (67.8±7.5 vs. 61.0±10.1 years), % male (56% vs. 39%), BMI (22.9±2.8 vs. 23.7±3.5), AAC rate (58% vs. 40%) and AAC-24 score (3 (0, 8) vs. 0 (0, 2)) were all significantly higher than in those (n = 205) without carotid artery plaque. In multivariate analysis, age (OR 1.172), male gender (OR 1.654), AAC (OR 1.352), and AAC-24 ≥5 (OR 4.191) were significantly associated with carotid artery plaque. Combining AAC-24 with age significantly increased the AUC from 0.632 to 0.834 (p<0.05). Conclusion There was a significant relationship between AAC on lumbar radiographs and carotid IMT."
https://openalex.org/W2908527470,"Forest fires in South Asia lead to widespread haze, where many healthy individuals develop psychosomatic symptoms. We investigated the effects of haze exposure on cerebral hemodynamics and new symptoms. We hypothesised that vasoactive substances present in the haze, would lead to vasodilation of cerebral vasculature, thereby altering cerebral hemodynamics, which in turn may account for new psychosomatic symptoms.Seventy-four healthy volunteers were recruited, and serial transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography was performed to record blood flow parameters of bilateral middle cerebral arteries (MCA). The first TCD was performed in an air-conditioned environment. It was repeated outdoors after the participants spent 30-minutes in the haze environment. The prevailing level of pollutant standards index (PSI) was recorded. Appropriate statistical analyses were performed to compare cerebral hemodynamics at baseline and after haze exposure in all participants. Subgroup analyses were then employed to compare the findings between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants.Study participants' median age was 30 years (IQR 26-34), and new psychosomatic symptoms were reported by 35 (47.3%). There was a modest but significant decrease in pulsatility index (PI) and resistivity index (RI) in the left MCA after haze exposure (PI: p = 0.026; RI: p = 0.021). When compared to baseline parameters, haze exposure resulted in significantly lower mean PI (p = 0.001) and RI (p = 0.001) in symptomatic patients, but this difference was not present in asymptomatic patients (PI: p = 0.919; RI: p = 0.970).Haze causes significant alterations in cerebral hemodynamics in susceptible individuals, probably responsible for various psychosomatic symptoms. The prognostic implications and health effects of haze require evaluation in a larger study."
https://openalex.org/W2910054052,"Objective To explore women’s experiences and perceptions of antenatal and intrapartum care in the Peruvian Amazon, including their perceived motivators, enablers and barriers to accessing care. Design Interpretive descriptive qualitative study using semi-structured face-to-face interviews. Setting Primary healthcare centre, Iquitos, Peru. Participants Women (n = 20) attending the healthcare centre who had given birth in the past 6 months. Measures Interviews were conducted using a female interpreter, transcribed clean verbatim and thematically analysed. Findings Four core themes relating to antenatal care were interpreted. (1) Perceived knowledge of antenatal care and its importance: women generally understood the importance of care, mainly for their baby’s health rather than their own. (2) Appointments and information received: women wanted more appointments to facilitate greater depth of information relating to their pregnancy. (3) Interaction with healthcare practitioners: women felt they received inadequate attention, care lacked continuity and they were often uncomfortable with male practitioners. (4) Perceived motivators, barriers and enablers to accessing antenatal care: Knowledge of the importance of care acted as the main motivator. Few direct barriers were identified, other than employment. Free care and ease of access enabled attendance. Two core themes were interpreted relating to intrapartum care. (1) Expectations and preferences for labour and delivery: the need for a safe environment for childbirth was acknowledged. (2) Actual experiences of labour and delivery: for most women labour and delivery experiences were not as they had expected. Women objected less to male professionals during labour than antenatal care. Conclusions and implications for practice Women reported negative experiences of both antenatal and intrapartum care. There is clearly a need for a more woman-centred approach to care and service provision. Ideally, this would involve employing more staff, acknowledging the implications on resources, improving attitudes towards women, facilitating continuity of care, and allowing patient choice to give women greater involvement."
https://openalex.org/W2910265471,"While aberrant cells are routinely recognized and removed by immune cells, tumors eventually escape innate immune responses. Infiltrating immune cells are even corrupted by the tumor to acquire a tumor-supporting phenotype. In line, tumor-associated macrophages are well-characterized to promote tumor progression and high levels of tumor-infiltrating macrophages are a poor prognostic marker in breast cancer. Here, we aimed to further decipher the influence of macrophages on breast tumor cells and determined global gene expression changes in three-dimensional tumor spheroids upon infiltration of macrophages. While various tumor-associated mRNAs were upregulated, expression of the cytochrome P450 family member CYP1A1 was markedly attenuated. Repression of CYP1A1 in tumor cells was elicited by a macrophage-shaped tumor microenvironment rather than by direct tumor cell-macrophage contacts. In line with changes in RNA expression profiles, macrophages enhanced proliferation of the tumor cells. Enhanced proliferation and macrophage presence further correlated with reduced CYP1A1 expression in patient tumors when compared with normal tissue. These findings are of interest in the context of combinatory therapeutic approaches involving cytotoxic and immune-modulatory compounds."

The study used 35 morpho-agronomic descriptors, proposed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply, and 12 quantitative descriptors suggested by NBIO. The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design, composed of four blocks, in the experimental field at UFRB in 2014. The frequency and entropy level of the qualitative descriptors were estimated with the Renyi procedure, and an analysis of variance was used for the quantitative descriptors. The analyses were made with the statistical program R. Of the qualitative morpho-agronomic descriptors evaluated, 22.86% had a high level of entropy (above 1.0), and all 12 quantitative descriptors showed significant differences. This indicates genetic variability in the germplasm bank and a satisfactory performance for most of the descriptors evaluated, as well as the possibility of direct and indirect use of the lineages and parents in genetic improvement programs of the species."
https://openalex.org/W2951701073,"To understand drug combination effect, it is necessary to decipher the interactions between drug targets-many of which are signaling molecules. Previously, such signaling pathway models are largely based on the compilation of literature data from heterogeneous cellular contexts. Indeed, de novo reconstruction of signaling interactions from large-scale molecular profiling is still lagging, compared to similar efforts in transcriptional and protein-protein interaction networks. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel algorithm for the systematic inference of protein kinase pathways, and applied it to published mass spectrometry-based phosphotyrosine profile data from 250 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) samples. The resulting network includes 43 TKs and 415 inferred, LUAD-specific substrates, which were validated at >60% accuracy by SILAC assays, including ""novel' substrates of the EGFR and c-MET TKs, which play a critical oncogenic role in lung cancer. This systematic, data-driven model supported drug response prediction on an individual sample basis, including accurate prediction and validation of synergistic EGFR and c-MET inhibitor activity in cells lacking mutations in either gene, thus contributing to current precision oncology efforts."

The aim of this study is to examine the associations of caloric restriction, inflammatory response profiles and outcomes in critically ill patients.This is a sub-study of the PermiT trial (Permissive Underfeeding or Standard Enteral Feeding in Critically Ill Adults Trial- ISRCTN68144998). Serum samples were collected on study days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 14 and analyzed for a panel of 29 cytokines. We used principal component analysis to convert possibly correlated variables (cytokine levels) into a limited number of linearly uncorrelated variables (principal components). We constructed repeated measures mixed linear models to assess whether permissive underfeeding compared to standard feeding was associated with difference cytokine levels over time.A total of 72 critically ill patients were enrolled in this study (permissive underfeeding n = 36 and standard feeding n = 36). Principal component analysis identified 6 components that were responsible for 78% of the total variance. When adjusted to principal components, permissive underfeeding was not associated with 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval 0.44, 6.95, p = 0.43) or with incident renal replacement therapy. The cytokines did not differ with time between permissive underfeeding and standard feeding groups.The association of permissive underfeeding compared to standard feeding with mortality was not influenced by the inflammatory profile. Permissive underfeeding compared to standard feeding was not associated with differences in the serum levels of cytokines in critically ill patients."
https://openalex.org/W2907209574,"Nearshore marine ecosystems can benefit from their interaction with adjacent ecosystems, especially if they alleviate nutrient limitations in nutrient poor areas. This was the case in our oligo- to mesotrophic study area, the KwaZulu-Natal Bight on the South African subtropical east coast, which is bordered by the Agulhas current. We built stoichiometric, multitrophic ecosystem networks depicting biomass and material flows of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in three subsystems of the bight. The networks were analysed to investigate whether the southern, middle and northern bight function similarly in terms of their productivity, transfer efficiency between trophic levels, material cycling, and nutrient limitations. The middle region of the bight was clearly influenced by nutrient additions from the Thukela River, as it had the highest ecosystem productivity, lower transfer efficiencies and degree of cycling. Most nodes in the networks were limited by phosphorus, followed by nitrogen. The middle region adjacent to the Thukela River showed a lower proportion of P limitation especially in summer. Interestingly, there was a clear distinction in sensitivities to nutrient limitations between lower and higher trophic level organisms. This is a reflection of their discrepant nutrient turnover times that are either higher, or lower, than that of the systems, and which might provide a balance to the system through this antagonistic influence. Furthermore, by tracking the stoichiometry through entire food webs it appeared how important the role of lower trophic level organisms was to regulate stoichiometry to more suitable ratios for higher trophic level requirements. Although we gained good insight into the behaviour of the three subsystems in the KZN Bight and the role of terrestrial influence on their functioning, a merged approach of incorporating data on metabolic constraints derived from experiments could further improve the representativeness of multitrophic stoichiometric ecosystem networks."
https://openalex.org/W2908685404,"Understanding how body weight is regulated at the molecular level is essential for treating obesity. We show that female mice genetically lacking protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) receptor type α (PTPRA) exhibit reduced weight and adiposity and increased energy expenditure, and are more resistant to diet-induced obesity than matched wild-type control mice. These mice also exhibit reduced levels of circulating leptin and are leptin hypersensitive, suggesting that PTPRA inhibits leptin signaling in the hypothalamus. Male and female PTPRA-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet were leaner and displayed increased metabolic rates and lower circulating leptin levels, indicating that the effects of loss of PTPRA persist in the obese state. Molecularly, PTPRA down-regulates leptin receptor signaling by dephosphorylating the receptor-associated kinase JAK2, with which the phosphatase associates constitutively. In contrast to the closely related tyrosine phosphatase ε, leptin induces only weak phosphorylation of PTPRA at its C-terminal regulatory site Y789, and this does not affect the activity of PTPRA toward JAK2. PTPRA is therefore an inhibitor of hypothalamic leptin signaling in vivo and may prevent premature activation of leptin signaling, as well as return signaling to baseline after exposure to leptin.—Cohen-Sharir, Y., Kuperman, Y., Apelblat, D., den Hertog, J., Spiegel, I., Knobler, H., Elson, A.

https://openalex.org/W2908807258,"To further reduce the noise and artifacts in the reconstructed image of sparse-view CT, we have modified the traditional total variation (TV) methods, which only calculate the gradient variations in x and y directions, and have proposed 8- and 26-directional (the multi-directional) gradient operators for TV calculation to improve the quality of reconstructed images. Different from traditional TV methods, the proposed 8- and 26-directional gradient operators additionally consider the diagonal directions in TV calculation. The proposed method preserves more information from original tomographic data in the step of gradient transform to obtain better reconstruction image qualities. Our algorithms were tested using two-dimensional Shepp-Logan phantom and three-dimensional clinical CT images. Results were evaluated using the root-mean-square error (RMSE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and universal quality index (UQI). All the experiment results show that the sparse-view CT images reconstructed using the proposed 8- and 26-directional gradient operators are superior to those reconstructed by traditional TV methods. Qualitative and quantitative analyses indicate that the more number of directions that the gradient operator has, the better images can be reconstructed. The 8- and 26-directional gradient operators we proposed have better capability to reduce noise and artifacts than traditional TV methods, and they are applicable to be applied to and combined with existing CT reconstruction algorithms derived from CS theory to produce better image quality in sparse-view reconstruction."

In addition, we assessed the probability that men would show a voided volume of ≥ 150 mL on uroflowmetry if the examination is repeated.Between 2016 and 2017, 352 men with storage symptoms were enrolled in the study. The patients completed the frequency-volume chart and were divided into four groups based on the voided volume. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine the variables affecting voided volume.The VV was < 68.8 mL in 88 patients (25.0%), 68.9-150 in 89 (25.3%), 150-250 in 87 (24.7%), and ≥ 250 in 88 (25.0%) patients. Although the International Prostate Symptom Score did not differ among the groups, the storage subscore was significantly higher in patients with decreased voided volume (p = 0.010). The total number of voids was greater in patients with decreased voided volume (p < 0.001), as was the number of nocturnal voids (p = 0.007). The maximum voided volume (p < 0.001) and 24-h urine output (p = 0.003) decreased as voided volume decreased. The proportions of patients with a mean daytime urine output ≥ 150 mL were 30.1%, 43.0%, 64.7%, and 66.7% in each group, respectively (p < 0.001). Older age and decreased maximum voided volume significantly affected the voided volume on initial uroflowmetry.A decreased voided volume on initial uroflowmetry may be a sign of severe storage symptoms in men. This finding is related to older age and decreased functional capacity. In these patients, it is better to perform a careful clinical assessment to diagnose and treat overactive bladder."
https://openalex.org/W2909323594,"Failure to account for misclassification error accruing from imperfect case-finding instruments can produce biased estimates of suspected major depression disorder (MDD) risk factor associations. The objective of this study was to estimate the impact of misclassification error on the magnitude of measures of association between suspected risk factors and MDD assessed using the Center of Epidemiological Studies on Depression—Short Form during the prenatal and postnatal periods. Baseline data were collected from 520 mothers participating in two home visitation studies in Oklahoma City between 2010 and 2014. A Bayesian binomial latent class model was used to compare the prevalence proportion ratio (PPR) between suspected risk factors and MDD with and without adjustment for misclassification error and confounding by period of MDD symptom on-set. Adjustment for misclassification error and confounding by period of MDD on-set (prenatal vs postnatal) showed that the association between suspected risk factors and MDD is underestimated (-) and overestimated (+) differentially in different source populations of low-income mothers. The median bias in the magnitude of PPR estimates ranged between -.47 (95% Bayesian Credible Intervals [BCI]: -10.67, 1.90) for intimate partner violence to +.06 (95%BCI: -0.37, 0.47) for race/ethnicity among native-born US residents. Among recent Hispanic immigrants, bias ranged from -.77 (95%BCI: -15.31, 0.96) for history of childhood maltreatment to +.10 (95%BCI: -0.17, 0.39) for adequacy of family resources. Overall, the extent of bias on measures of association between maternal MDD and suspected risk factors is considerable without adjustment for misclassification error and is even higher for confounding by period of MDD assessment. Consideration of these biases in MDD prevention research is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2909828704,"Male condoms are important to prevent transmission of HIV (and other STIs) and unwanted pregnancies. Research was conducted to evaluate the quality of male condoms available in the Dominican Republic market based on preliminary concerns of suspect product. Based on international testing standards (ISO 4074 and ASTM D 3492-08), condoms were sampled across ten prominent brands within the market and evaluated for airburst pressure / volume, freedom from holes, visual defects, package seal integrity, packaging and marking, lubricant quantity, and dimensions. Five of the brands were found to have extensive quality problems, where holes were found in 5.7% to 17.5% of the condoms (depending on the brand). Between 5.1% and 30.5% of these condoms failed to meet the requirements for airburst properties, and violations in regulatory labeling where observed. Three additional brands were compliant for the other tests, but were found to have the same challenges with labeling violations as the previous five brands. Two brands were found to be fully compliant with all aspects of the evaluation. The level of defects observed in these samples would greatly increase the risk of HIV transmission (and other STIs) and unwanted pregnancies. When projected on the annual market of male condoms sold in the Dominican Republic (~26 million), potentially over 1 million condoms could be estimated to adversely impact the health risk of the end-user. These results prompted action by the Dominican Republic regulatory authorities to investigate and remove poor quality product from the market. This research study emphasizes the need for continued vigilance towards increased regulatory and market surveillance efforts to better protect public health interests."
https://openalex.org/W2910975934,"Background and purpose Surgery for hip fractures is frequently followed by complications that hinder the rehabilitation. Only part of the complications are surgery-related, however these, including reoperation may have the highest impact. Operative protocols are designed to treat all patients equally, according to evidence based guidelines. Aim of this study was to investigate the association between strict adherence to an operative protocol and postoperative complications, especially reoperations. Materials and methods A retrospective analyses of a prospective cohort. The cohort included all patients aged ≥60 treated for a hip fracture at University Medical Center Groningen between July 2009 and June 2013. The files of the patients were searched for complications, including reoperations. To evaluate adherence to the operative protocol all X-rays were retrospectively reviewed and the fracture type was reclassified. This retrospective fracture classification was compared with the treatment method used. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess whether patients that were not treated strictly according to the operative protocol have higher odds of developing a complication or of undergoing a reoperation. Results The study population consisted of 479 patients with a mean age of 78.4 (SD 9.5) years. Reoperation was performed in 11% of the patients during the follow-up period. The operative protocol was not followed strictly in 12% of the patients. When the operative protocol was not followed, the odds of having a reoperation was 2.41 times higher (p = 0.02). The overall complication rate was 75% and did not differ in both groups. Conclusion Strict adherence to an evidence-based operative protocol is of major importance toward preventing implant-related problems and reoperations"
https://openalex.org/W2950147627,"Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans is an acidophilic chemolithoautotrophic bacterium widely used in the mining industry due to its metabolic sulfur-oxidizing capability. The biooxidation of sulfide minerals is enhanced through the attachment of At. thiooxidans cells to the mineral surface. The Type IV pili (TfP) of At. thiooxidans may play an important role in the bacteria attachment since TfP play a key adhesive role in the attachment and colonization of different surfaces. In this work, we report for the first time the mRNA sequence of three TfP proteins from At. thiooxidans, the adhesin protein PilY1 and the TfP pilins PilW and PilV. The nucleotide sequences of these TfP proteins show changes in some nucleotide positions with respect to the corresponding annotated sequences. The bioinformatic analyses and 3D-modeling of protein structures sustain their classification as TfP proteins, as structural homologs of the corresponding proteins of Ps. aeruginosa, results that sustain the role of PilY1, PilW and PilV in pili assembly. Also, that PilY1 comprises the conserved Neisseria-PilC (superfamily) domain of the tip-associated adhesin, while PilW of the superfamily of putative TfP assembly proteins and PilV belongs to the superfamily of TfP assembly protein. In addition, the analyses suggested the presence of specific functional domains involved in adhesion, energy transduction and signaling functions. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the PilY1 of Acidithiobacillus genus forms a cohesive group linked with iron- and/or sulfur-oxidizing microorganisms from acid mine drainage or mine tailings."
https://openalex.org/W2909547720,"Idarucizumab is a humanized Fab fragment that specifically reverses dabigatran anticoagulation. In trauma, volume expanders are used for resuscitation to compensate for blood loss and hemorrhagic shock, but it is unknown whether volume expanders influence the binding of dabigatran to its antidote. Using a porcine dilutional coagulopathy model, this study investigated whether volume replacement strategies affect binding of dabigatran to idarucizumab.Twenty-five male pigs were treated orally with dabigatran etexilate (30 mg/kg bid) for 3 days. The following day, animals were anesthetized, infused with dabigatran (total dose 0.645 mg/kg) to achieve supratherapeutic concentrations, and randomized 1:1:1:1:1 (n = 5 per group) to control (no hemodilution) or hemodilution where ~50% of blood volume was substituted with Ringer's solution, 6% hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4, 6% hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5 or 4% gelatin. Idarucizumab was then administered intravenously (30 mg/kg) and serial blood samples were taken for up to 24 hours to measure diluted thrombin time (corresponding with dabigatran activity), total dabigatran (bound to antidote and free drug) and a panel of coagulation parameters.Mean plasma dabigatran levels were 617 ± 16 ng/mL after infusion and 600 ± 114 ng/mL after ~50% hemodilution with no significant differences between groups. Following treatment with idarucizumab, plasma concentrations of unbound dabigatran decreased markedly, with similar reductions in all groups. Dabigatran-induced prolongation of coagulation parameters was rapidly reversed in all groups.This study indicates that several volume expanders used for resuscitation in trauma do not interfere with the binding of idarucizumab to dabigatran."
https://openalex.org/W2951082118,"This work provides theoretical tools to analyse the transcriptional effects of certain biochemical mechanisms (i.e. affinity and cooperativity) that have been proposed in previous literature to explain the proper spatial expression of Hedgehog target genes involved in Drosophila development. Specifically we have focused on the expression of decapentaplegic, wingless, stripe and patched. The transcription of these genes is believed to be controlled by enhancer modules able to interpret opposing gradients of the activator and repressor forms of the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci). This study is based on a thermodynamic approach, which provides expression rates for these genes. These expression rates are controlled by transcription factors which are competing and cooperating for common binding sites. We have made mathematical representations of the different expression rates which depend on multiple factors and variables. The expressions obtained with the model have been refined to produce simpler equivalent formulae which allow for their mathematical analysis. Thanks to this, we can evaluate the correlation between the different interactions involved in transcription and the biological features observed at tissular level. These mathematical models can be applied to other morphogenes to help understand the complex transcriptional logic of opposing activator and repressor gradients."
