https://openalex.org/W2032848335,"The appearance of a polar metabolite of 25-hydroxychotecalciferol has been studied in the intestinal mucosas of nephrectomized rats and rats which have been made uremic by ureter ligation. In confirmation of previous work by Fraser and Kodicek, it was found that nephrectomy prevents the appearance of this metabolite in the intestine. On the other hand, equivalent amounts of the metabolite were found in uremic rats and in sham-operated controls, showing that the production of this metabolite is independent of the uremic state of the animals. In addition, it was shown that the metabolite produced in vitro by kidney homogenates is identical to that found in vivo in the intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1568383024,"Abstract Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase has been prepared from the liver, skeletal muscle, heart muscle, kidney, epididymal fat pad, and brain cortex of the rat. Kinetic analysis indicated that all of these tissues, with the exception of liver exhibit complex behavior indicative of multiple enzymatic activities. The phosphodiesterase activities of brain cortex, kidney, and adipose tissue have been resolved on Bio-Gel A-1.5m gel filtration columns into three fractions. These are an excluded fraction, a high molecular weight fraction in which the enzymatic affinity for cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate is greater than that for cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, and a lower molecular weight fraction with a high affinity for cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. The lower molecular weight enzyme appears to be negatively cooperative. The muscle preparations have little, if any, of the excluded fraction which in kidney, adipose tissue, and brain has kinetic behavior similar to that of the lower molecular weight enzyme. Liver has no detectable phosphodiesterase activity in any except the intermediate fraction which has a molecular weight of approximately 400,000. This enzymatic activity has been purified 88-fold by centrifugation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and gel filtration. The potential for metabolic control through regulation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase is discussed in view of the existence of at least two distinct enzymatic activities in all of tissues studied except the liver."

https://openalex.org/W2140135598,"Abstract Glycopeptides were isolated from seven γG myeloma proteins and the γG-immunoglobulins of one normal individual. The composition of each glycopeptide was determined and the structure of the oligosaccharide portion of the molecule established as follows. Sequential enzymatic degradation of the oligosaccharide chains with purified glycosidases established the sequences of the sugars. Serial periodate oxidation and methylation of both intact and partially degraded glycopeptides followed by identification of the methylated sugars by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry established the linkages between sugars. The carbohydrate composition of the glycopeptides was found to be (in residues per mole of glycopeptide): sialic acid, 0 to 2; fucose, 0.6 to 1.2; galactose, 0.3 to 2.3; N-acetylglucosamine, 3.9 to 6.0; and mannose, 3. The variability in the number of sialic acid, fucose, and galactose residues was shown to be caused by microheterogeneity of the oligosaccharides while the variability in the number of N-acetylglucosamine residues reflects differences in the sequence of the sugars in the of the molecules. Two of the seven myeloma proteins had an additional oligosaccharide chain. All the glycopeptides are branched oligosaccharides containing two nonreducing termini with the sequence Gal (β1,6)/→ GlcNAc (β1,2)/→ Man. When sialic acid is present, it is linked α2,6 to the galactose residue. Both branches are connected to another mannose residue in the core, which also contains either 2 or 3 N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues. The sequence of sugars in the core varied from one glycopeptide to another, being either Man→GlcNAc→ GlcNAc→Asn, Man→[GlcNAc→]GlcNAc→Asn, or Man→ GlcNAc→[GlcNAc→]GlcNAc→Asn. Di-N-acetylchitobiose was isolated from the core of one glycopeptide with a core structure of Man→GlcNAc→GlcNAc→Asn. These studies establish that homogeneous γG-immunoglobulins of man may have different sequences of sugars in their oligosaccharide chains. The data also show that microheterogeneity of oligosaccharides exists in homogeneous glycoproteins secreted by a single clone of cells."
https://openalex.org/W1517835039,"Abstract All heme proteins containing mononuclear high spin ferric heme, when examined at low temperatures (near 1°K), exhibit X-band electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) absorptions extending from near g = 6 to g = 2 which arise from transitions of the lowest Kramers doublet. Meaningful absolute quantitation of high spin ferric EPR spectra cannot be made other than from experiments at very low temperature or from a knowledge of the zero field splitting. The characteristics of the EPR spectrum may be used to describe the symmetry of the heme. The incorporation of hemin into a protein constrains the heme in such a manner that there is a departure from tetragonal symmetry toward rhombic (gx ≠ gy). In these cases, the resonance absorption derivative near g = 6 is either broadened or split into two resolvable g values dependent upon the interaction of the protein with the heme. The greater the constraint on the heme imposed by the protein, the greater will be the departure from tetragonality. Thus, the EPR of high spin heme proteins can be used as a protein conformational probe."
https://openalex.org/W2065914370,"Five to ten nanograms of labeled angiotensin II rapidly injected in the left ventricle of adult rats was found to induce significant ultrastructural endothelial changes, resulting in net increases in number and size of pinocytotic vesicles as well as widening of intercellular spaces. This effect was followed by preferential localization of the compound in the nuclear zone of vascular and cardiac muscle cells. The selective cellular localization of angiotensin II suggests that this vasoactive agent or some of its metabolic fragments may have specific effects on nuclear function."
https://openalex.org/W1531735161,"Abstract Oxyhemoglobin either spontaneously or under the influence of external oxidants is converted to the high spin ferric protein (acid methemoglobin) which can be studied both optically and with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The rate of ferricyanide oxidation is comparable for oxyhemoglobin A, oxyhemoglobin H (β4), and oxy α chains. p-Mercuribenzoate (PMB) derivatives of oxy α and oxy β chains react faster with this reagent than do the nonderivatized proteins. With time, the high spin form of each hemoglobin preparation is converted to various low spin forms, heretofore collectively called Hemichromes are low spin derivatives of ferrihemoglobin, brought about through discrete reversible and irreversible changes of protein conformation so that atoms endogenous to the protein are now bound as the sixth ligand of the heme iron. The rate of formation of the first hemichromes from the obligatory high spin ferric protein is very slow with ferrihemoglobin A, faster with ferrihemoglobin H, and faster still with ferric α chains. This first hemichrome can be reversibly converted to deoxyhemoglobin by reduction to the hemochrome followed by anaerobic dialysis, or it can be converted quickly to oxyhemoglobin by reacting the hemochrome with CO which is then photolyzed in the presence of O2. It has been demonstrated that ferrihemoglobin cyanide prepared from high spin ferrihemoglobin H differs in structure from ferric hemoglobin cyanide prepared from the hemichrome of hemoglobin H, although the optical and EPR spectra of the two compounds are identical. With time, or under the influence of protein denaturants such as urea or salicylate, the hemichrome that can be reconstituted to oxyhemoglobin is converted to different hemichromes which are nonrenaturable to the oxy protein. Hemin added to whole globin yields high spin ferrihemoglobin A, whereas hemin added to globin prepared either from α or β subunits yields hemichrome."
https://openalex.org/W2028923111,"Batrachotoxin has been shown to be a pyrrolecarboxylic ester of a novel steroidal base with unique and selective actions on a variety of electrogenic membranes. The effects of batrachotoxin in neuromuscular preparations both pre- and postsynaptically, in nerve axons, in superior cervical ganglion, in heart Purkinje fibers, and in brain slices appear to be due to the selective and irreversible increase in permeability of membranes to sodium ions. The subsequent effects of this increase in Na(+) permeability evoked by batrachotoxin-such as membrane depolarization, enhanced spontaneous transmitter release, muscle contracture, and enhanced formation of cyclic AMP in brain slices-may be blocked reversibly by tetrodotoxin."
https://openalex.org/W1536392599,"Abstract Ferrous sulfmyoglobin was prepared from the higher oxidation state of myoglobin (Mbiv) by reaction at pH 8 with a 1.5-fold molar excess of (NH4)2S. The purity (g90%) was greater than any previously reported. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) of the ferric protein at low pH resembles that of ferric myoglobin, where the heme iron is high spin and is in a nearly axial environment. At high pH, the heme iron gives a low spin EPR signal, attributed to the hydroxide derivative, which is distinct from that of ferric myoglobin hydroxide. Acid-base titration of ferric sulfmyoglobin in the visible and near infrared gives a pK of 8.45 ± 0.05 while similar titration of ferric myoglobin yields a pK of 8.9 to 9.0. A computer analysis of the titration data for both compounds confirmed the pK for ferric sulfmyoglobin and, coupled with EPR data, has been used to determine the purity of the preparation. Evidence is presented that the small amount of impurity in the ferrous sulfmyoglobin preparation is present as oxymyoglobin. A computed spectrum of pure ferrous sulfmyoglobin is given, and has been used to re-evaluate the purity of preparations described in previous publications. Fluoride binding to ferric sulfmyoglobin was established by EPR. The low spin ferric cyanide and azide derivatives were studied by optical and EPR spectroscopy. An analysis of the EPR spectra of low spin derivatives of ferric sulfmyoglobin leads us to believe that the electronic distribution at the heme is different from that of ferric myoglobin and, combined with an analysis of optical properties, supports the hypothesis of a structure in which the elements of H2S add across a β—β double bond of a pyrrole and thereby disrupt the porphyrin conjugation and form a chlorin type structure."
https://openalex.org/W1607650747,"Abstract Isolated fat cells were incubated in Krebs-Ringer phosphate medium. Within 1 min after the addition of 1.1 µm epinephrine, the cyclic AMP content of the cells was elevated. It continued to rise, reaching a peak in 4 to 7 min, and fell thereafter, being only slightly above the control levels after 10 to 15 min. A maximal rate of glycerol production was established within 1 to 2 min, well before the peak in cyclic AMP concentration, and was maintained unchanged while the cyclic AMP level continued to rise and then fell. Both in magnitude and time course, the effect of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), 0.2 unit per ml, on cyclic AMP levels and on lipolysis was exactly like that of epinephrine (or of both hormones together). Addition of more epinephrine or of ACTH at several times during 1 hour of incubation with 1.1 µm epinephrine did not change cyclic AMP levels. The effects of epinephrine on cyclic AMP levels and on glycerol production were unaltered by the presence in the medium of 4 mm glucose. When propranolol (or insulin) was added several times after epinephrine-simulated lipolysis had begun, the rate of glycerol production fell to zero within 1 to 2 min. In the same period, the cyclic AMP concentration fell to a basal level; i.e. the rate of decrease was much greater than that observed after 4 to 7 min of incubation with epinephrine alone. Furthermore, after incubation of cells for 20 min with epinephrine, the addition of 0.8 mm theophylline produced an 8-fold rise in cyclic AMP content measured 5 min later. This increment was, however, only a fraction of that observed during the first 5 min after addition of epinephrine in the presence of theophylline. Since propranolol inhibits the action of epinephrine but does not alter basal adenyl cyclase activity, and, since 0.8 mm theophylline alone did not alter cyclic AMP levels, it may be concluded that adenyl cyclase was still epinephrine-stimulated during the time when cyclic AMP levels were falling. Whether the rate of formation of cyclic AMP during this period was equal to that during the first minutes after addition of the hormone cannot be established. Attempts to show directly alterations in phosphodiesterase activity during incubation of cells with epinephrine have been unsuccessful. When the effect of epinephrine was terminated after 4 min by the addition of propranolol, introduction of ACTH at several times during the following 20 min caused an immediate resumption of glycerol production at a rate equal to that observed with the initial addition of epinephrine. Cyclic AMP levels, however, rose little if at all in 4 to 5 min after addition of ACTH. The ability of cells to elevate cyclic AMP levels a second time in response to hormonal stimulation was restored when cells that had been incubated for 20 min were washed and suspended in fresh medium. There appears to be something accumulated in the medium during incubation of cells with epinephrine that interferes with the effectiveness of the hormone in causing accumulation of cyclic AMP in fresh cells. Whether this material has its effect on the rate of formation or of degradation of cyclic AMP cannot be decided."

https://openalex.org/W1521048080,"Abstract Cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate can be measured directly in crude tissue extracts by its stimulation of the rate of phosphorylation of casein catalyzed by skeletal muscle protein kinase. The reaction is carried out in the presence of tissue extract, which had been treated with and freed of trichloracetic acid, γ-32P-ATP-Mg2+, purified casein, and partly purified rabbit muscle protein kinase. The phosphorylated casein is isolated on filter paper discs. Cyclic AMP can be measured in 5 mg of tissue in the amount of 5 x 10-13 moles. Forty extracts can be assayed in 5 hours. Reproducibility of measurements made on heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and fat pad from several mammalian species varied ±5%. The validity of the assay is shown by measurements at various tissue dilutions, by the effect of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase treatment, by recovery of cyclic AMP added to tissue extracts, and by increases in tissue cyclic AMP concentrations in response to the administration of glucagon and catecholamines. Other nucleotides, including cyclic GMP, in concentrations similar to or larger than those found in the tissues we have investigated, do not interfere with the measurement of cyclic AMP. The procedure is also applicable to the measurement of adenyl cyclase activity without separation of the cyclic AMP produced."
https://openalex.org/W1595004840,"Abstract Glycoprotein substrates for neuraminidase and glycoprotein inhibitors of the agglutination of erythrocytes by influenza virus were subjected to oxidation by very low concentrations of periodate under conditions which selectively oxidize N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA), to the 8carbon and 7-carbon aldehydes. Molar ratios of periodate to NANA were varied from 0.2 to 4.5. Reduction of the oxidized glycoproteins with sodium borohydride yielded glycoproteins containing the 8- and 7-carbon analogues of NANA as well as the parent 9-carbon compound in amounts depending on the quantity of periodate employed. These were quantitated in the mixture by means of gas-liquid chromatography. Under the conditions used, periodate oxidation of other sugars in the glycoproteins could not be detected. The capacity of neuraminidases from Vibrio cholerae, Clostridium perfringens, and PR-8 influenza virus to cleave N-acetylneuraminic acid or its 8-carbon (NANA-8) or 7-carbon (NANA-7) analogues from native and modified orosomucoid and from NANA-, NANA-8-, and NANA-7-N-acetylgalactosaminitol were studied. NANA-8 was hydrolyzed from the glycoproteins and the reduced disaccharide at an initial rate about 30% of that for NANA. The 7-carbon analogue of NANA was not cleaved from the reduced disaccharide, but was slowly cleaved from modified orosomucoid at an initial rate of 5 to 10% of that for NANA. It was concluded that the optimum activity of neuraminidase requires the intact structure of the polyhydroxy side chain of NANA. When the molar ratio of periodate to NANA exceeded 1.5, all of the NANA was converted to the 8- and 7-carbon analogues, and the capacity of the glycoproteins to inhibit agglutination of human erythrocytes by PR-8 influenza virus was reduced by 95 to 100%. It is concluded that carbon atoms 7, 8, and 9 in the polyhydroxy side chain of NANA acid in glycoproteins are involved in their binding to influenza virus."

https://openalex.org/W1588957680,"Abstract Acetylphosphate is hydrolyzed by fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum of skeletal muscle serving as energy source for the active transport of calcium. Using 32P-acetylphosphate as substrate, the formation of a protein-bound phosphate compound was observed which is acid stable, sensitive to hydroxylamine, and accumulates to steady state concentrations of 3 to 8 moles per 106 g of protein with 5 mm CaCl2 and to 0.1 to 0.3 moles per 106 g of protein with 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.5 mm ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetate as activators. The concentration of phosphoprotein is only slightly influenced by K+ and Na+ used alone or in combination, and steady state concentrations are reached within minutes at 25°. Using 32P-acetylphosphate as substrate, unlabeled ATP or ADP effectively reduced the level of protein-bound radioactivity, and inhibited the hydrolysis of acetylphosphate in a manner suggesting competition for the same site. Phosphate transfer from acetyl-32P to ADP yielding AT32P was also observed. The hydrolysis of acetylphosphate by fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum required Mg++ and Ca++, was inhibited by phospholipase C, and was partially reactivated by lysolecithin, suggesting that acetylphosphate promotes Ca++ transport by essentially the same mechanism as ATP. Carbamylphosphate also serves as energy source for Ca++ translocation, although the carbamylphosphatase activity, unlike the hydrolysis of ATP and acetylphosphate, is not activated by Ca++ in the presence of Mg++."

https://openalex.org/W1574908849,"The sequence of the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase was investigated. The pyruvate14CO2 exchange reaction and acetoin formation are inhibited by electron acceptors such as ferredoxin, FAD, FMN, and dyes, but not by DPN. The enzyme catalyzes the formation of acetoin in the presence of pyruvate and acetaldehyde, which suggests that hydroxyethyl thiamine pyrophosphate is an intermediate of the reaction. When substrate levels of the enzyme reacted with pyruvate, a stoichiometric amount of HCO3- was formed but the enzyme chromophore is not reduced. The addition of coenzyme A to the reaction mixture in the absence of an electron acceptor leads to bleaching of the enzyme chromophore and formation of a stoichiometric amount of acetyl-CoA. The enzyme chromophore reduced by addition of pyruvate and CoA is reoxidized by FAD or ferredoxin. The chromophore is also reduced by reduced ferredoxin formed by the hydrogenase system. Based on these observations a reaction sequence is proposed and evidence in support of the mechanism is discussed. It is concluded that the enzyme chromophore, rather than ferredoxin, serves as a primary electron acceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1600933472,"Abstract Specific properties and characteristics of the vitamin D-induced calcium-binding protein were studied. The pH-calcium-binding curve indicated two maxima, one at about pH 6.6 and the other at about pH 9.6. The isoelectric point was estimated to be in the range of 4.0 to 4.4. Alkali metal chlorides nonselectively reduced the binding capacity of calcium-binding protein; there was about a 40% reduction at 0.15 m KCl or NaCl. Urea, at concentrations of 1 m and 8 m, inhibited binding by about 30% and 100%, respectively, suggesting that the conformation integrity of calcium-binding protein is required for maximum binding. From competitive inhibitor studies, the order of binding of the alkali earth metals was estimated to be Ca g Sr g Ba g Mg, and this sequence is not predicted on the basis of either energy of hydration or the crystal radius of the metal cations. Other divalent cations shown to compete with 45Ca for the binding site or depress binding by another mechanism were Zn++, Cd++, Mn++, and Fe++; under the conditions used, Co++ and Ni++ were ineffective. N-Ethylmaleimide, iodoacetate, and β-mercaptoethanol did not alter 45Ca-binding, indicating that sulfhydryl groups are not directly involved in the binding reaction. Organic compounds, besides urea, shown to interfere with binding were cetrimide, lysolecithin, and myristoylcholine but not acetylcholine, among others. No adenosine triphosphatase activity, with or without calcium, was associated with protein. The α helical content of calcium-binding protein, as estimated from circular dichroism data, was of the order of 30 to 40%."

Accompanying the induction of this protein, there was enhanced radiocalcium uptake by the intestine. These observations represent the first demonstration of an in vitro physiological effect of vitamin D(3) on the calcium absorptive mechanism of the intestine."

Electron microscopy of the poisoned nerve-muscle junction shows a sequence of motor nerve ending damage that culminates in disruption of the prejunctional membrane and loss of all organelles, including synaptic vesicles. The postjunctional membrane was morphologically unaffected. After complete poisoning, the contractile response to exogenous acetylcholine was severely impaired, an indication that the prejunctional site is chiefly involved in the contractile response produced by exogenous acetylcholine and that the pre- and postjunctional effects of acetylcholine were separated."

https://openalex.org/W175182376,"Abstract Perfused hearts from adrenal-deficient rats showed an impaired glycogenolytic response to suboptimal concentrations of epinephrine as judged by measurements of tissue glycogen and lactate production. The glycogenolytic response could be restored to normal by treatment of these animals with cortisol in vivo. Individual steps in the path of epinephrine-stimulated glycogenolysis were examined. Adrenalectomy did not impair adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate accumulation in response to several concentrations of epinephrine; a histone kinase, partially purified from hearts of adrenalectomized rats, was as sensitive to activation by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate as the enzyme prepared from normal hearts; and the activation of phosphorylase b kinase by several concentrations of epinephrine was unaffected by the deficiency of adrenal cortical hormones. However, suboptimal concentrations of epinephrine did not activate phosphorylase in hearts from adrenalectomized rats to the normal extent. These findings suggest therefore that the defect following adrenalectomy lies in the activity of phosphorylase b kinase. The defect could be overcome by administration of adrenal glucocorticoid in vivo or by raising the perfusate calcium concentration."

In the dystrophic chickens, the rate of rise of the action potential was decreased. With repetitive indirect stimulation, the action potentials decreased in size and disappeared; only an end-plate potential remained. Membrane resistance, membrane capacitance, and duration of miniature end-plate potentials were increased. A decrease in sodium permeability may be in part responsible for the observed alterations in the electrical properties of the nerve terminal and postsynaptic muscle membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1509814541,"Abstract Adenyl cyclase has been purified from the soluble fraction of Streptococcus salivarius by differential centrifugation, DNase treatment, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-200. The enzyme was repeatedly recovered from the Sephadex G-200 column in three distinct peaks, each devoid of ATPase, GTPase, cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase, cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase, and pyrophosphatase. The enzyme in all peaks (I, II, III), however, contained a small (2.1 to 6.7%) amount of guanyl cyclase activity. Enzyme III was the most homogeneous, containing only two faint contaminating bands on disc gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent, was stabilized by cysteine (5 and 10 mm) and was activated by NaF. While the pH optimum for Enzymes II and III was 8.0, that for Enzyme I was pH 7.5. The Km values for Enzymes I and II were both 1 mm for ATP, and were unaffected by 20 mm NaF, the optimal concentration for activation of the enzyme. The Km value for Enzyme III, however, was increased from 0.7 to 3.3 mm in the presence of NaF. In all cases, the Vmax for all three enzyme preparations was increased in assays with NaF by as much as 5-fold (e.g. II and III). Hill plots for all enzyme preparations gave slope values (n) of 1 indicating only one substrate-binding site on the enzyme; the slopes were unaffected by NaF. Sulfhydryl inhibitors, N-ethylmaleimide, and p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, were almost completely inhibitory at 1 mm suggesting the involvement of —SH groups in catalysis. Cysteine (1 mm) limited inhibition by these reagents significantly at inhibitor concentrations below 0.1 mm. ATP synthesis from cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and pyrophosphate by adenyl cyclase was favored with K values for ATP formation ranging from 43 to 64. NaF inhibited the reverse reaction, with the reduction in reaction rate most severe with Enzyme III (73%). The average ΔF° for the synthesis of ATP was -2.48 kcal per mole."
https://openalex.org/W1964816610,"The antiviral activities of analogs of the double-stranded complex of polyinosinic and polycytidylic acids [poly(I).poly(C)], which is a potent interferon inducer, have been studied.

Unexpectedly, however, the complex of polyinosinic acid and poly(1-vinylcytosine), which is only a much more distantly related analog of poly(I) . poly(C), shows high activity. It is postulated that the high activity is related to the reduction of the charge/mass ratio and to the existence of this complex in an aggregated state; these are two factors that generally enhance the uptake of compo unds by cells."

https://openalex.org/W1483787725,"Abstract A reaction between the catalytic subunit of Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamylase and potassium permanganate is described. The reaction is accompanied by a rapid loss of the enzyme's catalytic activity even when stoichiometric amounts of permanganate and enzyme are used. Characterization of the inactivated enzyme has shown that when stoichiometric amounts of permanganate are used for the inactivation the only chemical change detected is oxidation of the enzyme's three cysteine thiol groups to sulfonate groups. The rate of inactivation of the enzyme by permanganate was found to be greatly decreased by the substrate carbamyl phosphate and to a lesser extent by the inhibitors phosphate, pyrophosphate, and succinate. Competition experiments show that the thiol groups of the catalytic subunit are approximately 45 times as reactive toward permanganate as the thiol group of 2-mercaptoethanol. This result is to be contrasted to the results of Vanaman and Stark (J. Biol. Chem., 245, 3565 (1970)) which showed that the thiol groups of catalytic subunit are hyporeactive or unreactive toward the many thiol reagents that they tested. The facility with which permanganate reacts with the protein's thiol groups may be a result of the structural resemblance between permanganate and the competitive inhibitor phosphate ion, a resemblance which is not shared by the other thiol reagents. Certain chemical properties of permanganate ion are pointed out which recommend it as a potential affinity reagent for phosphate binding sites in other proteins."

At pH 7.5 the Km value for 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide was determined to be 6.4 x 10-6 m. The spectrophotometric method was used to study the effect of pH on the Km and Vmax of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, and the stability of the enzyme at different temperatures. Sucrose density gradient studies showed the enzyme to have an estimated sedimentation coefficient of 3.1 S at 20°."

In addition to 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or an analogous nucleotide is required for enzyme activity and the stoichiometric hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and orthophosphate with formation of products, nicotinic acid mononucleotide and pyrophosphate, was verified with this purified preparation. The nucleotide specificity, however, is broader than that of the liver form of this enzyme. The molecular weight of the yeast enzyme was estimated from Sephadex chromatography to be 43,000 (about one-half that of the liver enzyme) whether in the presence or absence of ATP. Phosphate ions greatly stimulate the enzyme activity, giving optimum activity in the range of 10 to 100 mm phosphate in the presence of 5 mm Mg++. At 1 and 5 mm Mg++, optimum enzyme activities are observed with equimolar concentration of ATP. The enzyme catalyzes isotope exchange between ATP and ADP at rates approximately 8 times its molecular activity with all substrates, although no net ATP hydrolysis occurs in the absence of other substrates. ATP, guanosine triphosphate, and the substrates, nicotinic acid and 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate, protect the enzyme from heat inactivation."

https://openalex.org/W1599942539,"Abstract Ovine and human follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were modified by periodate oxidation followed by borohydride reduction, yielding FSH-containing analogues of N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) shortened by 1 or 2 carbon atoms. The FSH activity of the modified preparations was assayed by the human chorionic gonadotropin augmentation assay. The treatment decreased the biological activity of FSH somewhat, but, even when no unmodified NANA remained, the potency was still about half that of untreated FSH. Treatment of either native or modified FSH with neuraminidase resulted in the release of all NANA and NANA-8 and some NANA-7, and the loss of hormonal activity. It appears, therefore, that an intact 3-carbon polyhydroxy side chain in NANA is not required for full FSH activity."
https://openalex.org/W1496400749,"Abstract Lactate dehydrogenase (d-lactate:oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.28) from the homolactate-fermenting fungus, Pythium debaryanum, has been purified to a homogeneous-preparation with a yield of 10 to 12%. The enzyme has a molecular weight of approximately 98,000 to 115,000 daltons. It is inhibited by very low concentrations of GTP. GDP, ITP, and ATP are considerably less effective than GTP. All nucleotides, except GTP and GDP, which inhibit the enzyme act competitively at the pyridine nucleotide active site or sites. Inhibition by GTP is allosteric. GTP increases the cooperative binding of NADH and d(-)-lactate but not the binding of NAD+ and pyruvate. The latter substrates bind noncooperatively. A physiological basis for the regulation of the enzyme is presented. GTP, presumably, modulates the enzyme to regulate the flow of pyruvate, via oxalacetate and P-enolpyruvate when there is a demand for glucogenetic metabolism. The kinetic mechanism of the enzyme has been deduced to be an obligatory ordered binary-binary process. Either NAD+ or NADH must first bind to the free enzyme before lactate or pyruvate can bind. From the GTP inhibition plots, two binding sites for NADH and four for lactate were estimated. Inhibition by GTP has been found to be widespread among d(-)-lactate dehydrogenases present in fungi belonging to the Oomycetes and Hypochytridiomycetes."

https://openalex.org/W1246567457,"Abstract A comparative study of the Na+-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase system in high potassium (HK) and low potassium (LK) sheep red cell membranes was carried out. For HK:LK activity, the approximate ratios were as follows: 10 for Na+-ATPase, 13 for Na+, K+-ATPase, and 2.7 for [14C]-ADP-ATP exchange activity; the ratio of Na+-stimulated membrane phosphorylation was approximately 7. With Na+ present, K+ at concentrations below 5 mm stimulated ATPase activity in HK membranes but not in LK membranes; above 5 mm, K+ inhibited Na+-ATPase, to an extent much greater in LK than HK membranes. [14C]ADP-ATP exchange in the presence of Na+ and oligomycin was similarly inhibited by K+, markedly in LK, but only slightly in HK membranes. These observations are consistent with data reported for the Na+, K+ pumping activity in HK and LK cells described by D. C. Tosteson (in G. A. Jamieson and T. J. Greenwalt (Editors), Red cell membrane, structure and function, J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, 1969, p. 291) and P. G. Hoffman (Ph.D. thesis, Duke University, 1969), and provide evidence at the molecular level for the physiological differences in activity between HK and LK cells."

The rate of histone phosphorylation catalyzed by the kinase from each of these cell lines was stimulated two- to three-fold by 1 x 10(-6) molar adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. The same concentration of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate failed to stimulate these kinases."

https://openalex.org/W1552660771,"Abstract Five components of leucine transfer ribonucleic acid in Escherichia coli separated on a reversed phase column were charged with radioactive leucine. Each labeled leucyl-tRNA was subjected to an exchange reaction with unlabeled E. coli tRNA in which the labeled leucine could be transferred from one leucine tRNA to another. The exchange product, when analyzed on methylated albumin-Kieselguhr columns, suggested that a single leucyl-tRNA synthetase was responsible for the attachment of leucine to all five leucine tRNAs. The existence of a single synthetase specific for all five components of leucine tRNA was further supported by studying the reaction rate of mixed substrates containing two leucine tRNAs under a condition in which the rate was enzyme-dependent."

https://openalex.org/W2462962916,"The occurrence of a GTP-dependent, cAMP (cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate)-binding component in crude extracts of Escherichia coli reported by others was confirmed. This binding of cAMP is partially inhibited by high concentrations of the translocation inhibitor, fusidic acid. In contrast to the earlier report, however, purified preparations of G factor (the soluble translocation protein) possess insignificant cAMP binding activity; less than 1 in 10,000 molecules of G factor active in forming the ribosome-G factor-GDP complex binds cAMP. Attempts to purify the GTP-dependent, cAMP-binding component were hampered by its instability although it was determined to be relatively stable in the presence of GTP and cAMP. The GTP-dependent, cAMP-binding component did not react with G factor-specific antibodies; neither its binding activity nor sedimentation characteristics were altered by these antibodies. It is concluded that the GTP-dependent binding of cAMP is not a property of G factor itself and that G factor is not required for the binding of cAMP to this component. The nature and functional significance of the GTP-dependent, cAMP-binding component remains to be determined."
