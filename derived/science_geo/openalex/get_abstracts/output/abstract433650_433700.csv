https://openalex.org/W2275877493,"Lung squamous cell carcinoma is a common type of lung cancer, causing approximately 400,000 deaths per year worldwide. Genomic alterations in squamous cell lung cancers have not been comprehensively characterized, and no molecularly targeted agents have been specifically developed for its treatment. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas, here we profile 178 lung squamous cell carcinomas to provide a comprehensive landscape of genomic and epigenomic alterations. We show that the tumour type is characterized by complex genomic alterations, with a mean of 360 exonic mutations, 165 genomic rearrangements, and 323 segments of copy number alteration per tumour. We find statistically recurrent mutations in 11 genes, including mutation of TP53 in nearly all specimens. Previously unreported loss-of-function mutations are seen in the HLA-A class I major histocompatibility gene. Significantly altered pathways included NFE2L2 and KEAP1 in 34%, squamous differentiation genes in 44%, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway genes in 47%, and CDKN2A and RB1 in 72% of tumours. We identified a potential therapeutic target in most tumours, offering new avenues of investigation for the treatment of squamous cell lung cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2065656177,"The role of skeletal muscle in nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) is not well understood. Here we show that sarcolipin (Sln), a newly identified regulator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (Serca) pump, is necessary for muscle-based thermogenesis. When challenged to acute cold (4 °C), Sln(-/-) mice were not able to maintain their core body temperature (37 °C) and developed hypothermia. Surgical ablation of brown adipose tissue and functional knockdown of Ucp1 allowed us to highlight the role of muscle in NST. Overexpression of Sln in the Sln-null background fully restored muscle-based thermogenesis, suggesting that Sln is the basis for Serca-mediated heat production. We show that ryanodine receptor 1 (Ryr1)-mediated Ca(2+) leak is an important mechanism for Serca-activated heat generation. Here we present data to suggest that Sln can continue to interact with Serca in the presence of Ca(2+), which can promote uncoupling of the Serca pump and cause futile cycling. We further show that loss of Sln predisposes mice to diet-induced obesity, which suggests that Sln-mediated NST is recruited during metabolic overload. These data collectively suggest that SLN is an important mediator of muscle thermogenesis and whole-body energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2110503722,"The combinatorial cross-regulation of hundreds of sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) defines a regulatory network that underlies cellular identity and function. Here we use genome-wide maps of in vivo DNaseI footprints to assemble an extensive core human regulatory network comprising connections among 475 sequence-specific TFs and to analyze the dynamics of these connections across 41 diverse cell and tissue types. We find that human TF networks are highly cell selective and are driven by cohorts of factors that include regulators with previously unrecognized roles in control of cellular identity. Moreover, we identify many widely expressed factors that impact transcriptional regulatory networks in a cell-selective manner. Strikingly, in spite of their inherent diversity, all cell-type regulatory networks independently converge on a common architecture that closely resembles the topology of living neuronal networks. Together, our results provide an extensive description of the circuitry, dynamics, and organizing principles of the human TF regulatory network."
https://openalex.org/W1966607693,"The RV144 trial demonstrated 31% vaccine efficacy at preventing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection. Antibodies against the HIV-1 envelope variable loops 1 and 2 (Env V1 and V2) correlated inversely with infection risk. We proposed that vaccine-induced immune responses against V1/V2 would have a selective effect against, or sieve, HIV-1 breakthrough viruses. A total of 936 HIV-1 genome sequences from 44 vaccine and 66 placebo recipients were examined. We show that vaccine-induced immune responses were associated with two signatures in V2 at amino acid positions 169 and 181. Vaccine efficacy against viruses matching the vaccine at position 169 was 48% (confidence interval 18% to 66%; P = 0.0036), whereas vaccine efficacy against viruses mismatching the vaccine at position 181 was 78% (confidence interval 35% to 93%; P = 0.0028). Residue 169 is in a cationic glycosylated region recognized by broadly neutralizing and RV144-derived antibodies. The predicted distance between the two signature sites (21 ± 7 Å) and their match/mismatch dichotomy indicate that multiple factors may be involved in the protection observed in RV144. Genetic signatures of RV144 vaccination in V2 complement the finding of an association between high V1/V2-binding antibodies and reduced risk of HIV-1 acquisition, and provide evidence that vaccine-induced V2 responses plausibly had a role in the partial protection conferred by the RV144 regimen."
https://openalex.org/W1985806842,"We examined mouse models with altered adipocyte expression of mitoNEET, a protein residing in the mitochondrial outer membrane, to probe its impact on mitochondrial function and subsequent cellular responses. We found that overexpression of mitoNEET enhances lipid uptake and storage, leading to an expansion of the mass of adipose tissue. Despite the resulting massive obesity, benign aspects of adipose tissue expansion prevail, and insulin sensitivity is preserved. Mechanistically, we also found that mitoNEET inhibits mitochondrial iron transport into the matrix and, because iron is a rate-limiting component for electron transport, lowers the rate of β-oxidation. This effect is associated with a lower mitochondrial membrane potential and lower levels of reactive oxygen species-induced damage, along with increased production of adiponectin. Conversely, a reduction in mitoNEET expression enhances mitochondrial respiratory capacity through enhanced iron content in the matrix, ultimately corresponding to less weight gain on a high-fat diet. However, this reduction in mitoNEET expression also causes heightened oxidative stress and glucose intolerance. Thus, manipulation of mitochondrial function by varying mitoNEET expression markedly affects the dynamics of cellular and whole-body lipid homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2164671411,"The integrity of the epidermis and mucosal epithelia is highly dependent on resident self-renewing stem cells, which makes them vulnerable to physical and chemical insults compromising the repopulating capacity of the epithelial stem cell compartment. This is frequently the case in cancer patients receiving radiation or chemotherapy, many of whom develop mucositis, a debilitating condition involving painful and deep mucosal ulcerations. Here, we show that inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) with rapamycin increases the clonogenic capacity of primary human oral keratinocytes and their resident self-renewing cells by preventing stem cell senescence. This protective effect of rapamycin is mediated by the increase in expression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and the consequent inhibition of ROS formation and oxidative stress. mTOR inhibition also protects from the loss of proliferative basal epithelial stem cells upon ionizing radiation in vivo, thereby preserving the integrity of the oral mucosa and protecting from radiation-induced mucositis."

https://openalex.org/W2145506563,"Several homology-dependent pathways can repair potentially lethal DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The first step common to all homologous recombination reactions is the 5'-3' degradation of DSB ends that yields the 3' single-stranded DNA required for the loading of checkpoint and recombination proteins. In yeast, the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex (Xrs2 is known as NBN or NBS1 in humans) and Sae2 (known as RBBP8 or CTIP in humans) initiate end resection, whereas long-range resection depends on the exonuclease Exo1, or the helicase-topoisomerase complex Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 together with the endonuclease Dna2 (refs 1-6). DSBs occur in the context of chromatin, but how the resection machinery navigates through nucleosomal DNA is a process that is not well understood. Here we show that the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fun30 protein and its human counterpart SMARCAD1 (ref. 8), two poorly characterized ATP-dependent chromatin remodellers of the Snf2 ATPase family, are directly involved in the DSB response. Fun30 physically associates with DSB ends and directly promotes both Exo1- and Sgs1-dependent end resection through a mechanism involving its ATPase activity. The function of Fun30 in resection facilitates the repair of camptothecin-induced DNA lesions, although it becomes dispensable when Exo1 is ectopically overexpressed. Interestingly, SMARCAD1 is also recruited to DSBs, and the kinetics of recruitment is similar to that of EXO1. The loss of SMARCAD1 impairs end resection and recombinational DNA repair, and renders cells hypersensitive to DNA damage resulting from camptothecin or poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor treatments. These findings unveil an evolutionarily conserved role for the Fun30 and SMARCAD1 chromatin remodellers in controlling end resection, homologous recombination and genome stability in the context of chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1966382491,"Carl Anderson and colleagues report dense genotyping, using the Immunochip array, of 2,861 primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) cases and 8,514 controls. They identify three loci newly associated with PBC, and their fine-mapping of previous susceptibility loci identifies five regions with multiple independent common, low-frequency and rare variant associations. We genotyped 2,861 cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) from the UK PBC Consortium and 8,514 UK population controls across 196,524 variants within 186 known autoimmune risk loci. We identified 3 loci newly associated with PBC (at P < 5 × 10−8), increasing the number of known susceptibility loci to 25. The most associated variant at 19p12 is a low-frequency nonsynonymous SNP in TYK2, further implicating JAK-STAT and cytokine signaling in disease pathogenesis. An additional five loci contained nonsynonymous variants in high linkage disequilibrium (LD; r2 > 0.8) with the most associated variant at the locus. We found multiple independent common, low-frequency and rare variant association signals at five loci. Of the 26 independent non–human leukocyte antigen (HLA) signals tagged on the Immunochip, 15 have SNPs in B-lymphoblastoid open chromatin regions in high LD (r2 > 0.8) with the most associated variant. This study shows how data from dense fine-mapping arrays coupled with functional genomic data can be used to identify candidate causal variants for functional follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2134903961,"The cell-fate decision leading to gametogenesis is essential for sexual reproduction. In S. cerevisiae, only diploid MATa/α but not haploid MATa or MATα cells undergo gametogenesis, known as sporulation. We find that transcription of two long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) mediates mating-type control of sporulation. In MATa or MATα haploids, expression of IME1, the central inducer of gametogenesis, is inhibited in cis by transcription of the lncRNA IRT1, located in the IME1 promoter. IRT1 transcription recruits the Set2 histone methyltransferase and the Set3 histone deacetylase complex to establish repressive chromatin at the IME1 promoter. Inhibiting expression of IRT1 and an antisense transcript that antagonizes the expression of the meiotic regulator IME4 allows cells expressing the haploid mating type to sporulate with kinetics that are indistinguishable from that of MATa/α diploids. Conversely, expression of the two lncRNAs abolishes sporulation in MATa/α diploids. Thus, transcription of two lncRNAs governs mating-type control of gametogenesis in yeast."

https://openalex.org/W2045090937,"Chromosomal double-strand breaks (DSBs) are resected by 5' nucleases to form 3' single-stranded DNA substrates for binding by homologous recombination and DNA damage checkpoint proteins. Two redundant pathways of extensive resection have been described both in cells and in vitro, one relying on Exo1 exonuclease and the other on Sgs1 helicase and Dna2 nuclease. However, it remains unknown how resection proceeds within the context of chromatin, where histones and histone-bound proteins represent barriers for resection enzymes. Here we identify the yeast nucleosome-remodelling enzyme Fun30 as a factor promoting DSB end resection. Fun30 is the major nucleosome remodeller promoting extensive Exo1- and Sgs1-dependent resection of DSBs. The RSC and INO80 chromatin-remodelling complexes and Fun30 have redundant roles in resection adjacent to DSB ends. ATPase and helicase domains of Fun30, which are needed for nucleosome remodelling, are also required for resection. Fun30 is robustly recruited to DNA breaks and spreads along the DSB coincident with resection. Fun30 becomes less important for resection in the absence of the histone-bound Rad9 checkpoint adaptor protein known to block 5' strand processing and in the absence of either histone H3 K79 methylation or γ-H2A, which mediate recruitment of Rad9 (refs 9, 10). Together these data suggest that Fun30 helps to overcome the inhibitory effect of Rad9 on DNA resection."
https://openalex.org/W2052337358,"Immune tolerance is instituted early in life, during which time regulatory T (T(reg)) cells have an important role. Recurrent infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in early life increase the risk for asthma in adult life. Repeated infection of infant mice tolerized to ovalbumin (OVA) through their mother's milk with RSV induced allergic airway disease in response to OVA sensitization and challenge, including airway inflammation, hyper-reactivity and higher OVA-specific IgE, as compared to uninfected tolerized control mice. Virus infection induced GATA-3 expression and T helper type 2 (T(H)2) cytokine production in forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)(+) T(reg) cells and compromised the suppressive function of pulmonary T(reg) cells in a manner that was dependent on interleukin-4 receptor α (IL-4Rα) expression in the host. Thus, by promoting a T(H)2-type inflammatory response in the lung, RSV induced a T(H)2-like effector phenotype in T(reg) cells and attenuated tolerance to an unrelated antigen (allergen). Our findings highlight a mechanism by which viral infection targets a host-protective mechanism in early life and increases susceptibility to allergic disease."
https://openalex.org/W1992425170,"Pten deletion from adult mouse hematopoietic cells activates the PI3-kinase pathway, inducing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation, HSC depletion, and leukemogenesis. Pten is also mutated in human leukemias, but rarely in early childhood leukemias. We hypothesized that this reflects developmental changes in PI3-kinase pathway regulation. Here we show that Rictor deletion prevents leukemogenesis and HSC depletion after Pten deletion in adult mice, implicating mTORC2 activation in these processes. However, Rictor deletion had little effect on the function of normal HSCs. Moreover, Pten deletion from neonatal HSCs did not activate the PI3-kinase pathway or promote HSC proliferation, HSC depletion, or leukemogenesis. Pten is therefore required in adult, but not neonatal, HSCs to negatively regulate mTORC2 signaling. This demonstrates that some critical tumor suppressor mechanisms in adult cells are not required by neonatal cells. Developmental changes in key signaling pathways therefore confer temporal changes upon stem cell self-renewal and tumor suppressor mechanisms. Pten deletion from adult mouse hematopoietic cells activates the PI3-kinase pathway, inducing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) proliferation, HSC depletion, and leukemogenesis.

This demonstrates that some critical tumor suppressor mechanisms in adult cells are not required by neonatal cells. Developmental changes in key signaling pathways therefore confer temporal changes upon stem cell self-renewal and tumor suppressor mechanisms. Levels of phosphorylated AKT do not necessarily increase in dividing HSCs Pten deletion promotes HSC proliferation and leukemogenesis by activating mTORC2 RICTOR, and therefore mTORC2, deficiency has little effect on normal HSC function PTEN maintains HSCs and suppresses leukemia in adult, but not neonatal, mice Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) persist throughout life by undergoing self-renewing divisions regulated by networks of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors (He et al., 2009He S. Nakada D. Morrison S.J. Mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2009; 25: 377-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Mechanisms that promote HSC self-renewal are commonly overactivated or ectopically activated in leukemia cells (Reya et al., 2001Reya T. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Stem cells, cancer, and cancer stem cells.Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7861) Google Scholar). These self-renewal mechanisms are co-opted by leukemia cells irrespective of whether they arise from HSCs or from restricted progenitors (Krivtsov et al., 2006Krivtsov A.V. Twomey D. Feng Z. Stubbs M.C. Wang Y. Faber J. Levine J.E. Wang J. Hahn W.C.

HSC properties and self-renewal mechanisms change over time. The transcription factor Sox17 is required for the maintenance of fetal and neonatal, but not adult, HSCs (Kim et al., 2007Kim I.

Conversely, the epigenetic/transcriptional regulators Bmi-1, Tel/Etv6, and Gfi-1 regulate the maintenance of postnatal, but not fetal, HSCs (Lessard and Sauvageau, 2003Lessard J. Sauvageau G.

The temporal changes in HSC self-renewal mechanisms raise the question of whether the driver mutations that are competent to cause leukemia also change over time. Hematopoietic malignancies occur throughout life and the incidence of specific driver mutations varies with patient age, even within the same subtype of leukemia (Downing and Shannon, 2002Downing J.R. Shannon K.M. Acute leukemia: a pediatric perspective.Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 437-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Myeloid leukemias in young children are often driven by translocations involving transcription factors (Downing and Shannon, 2002Downing J.R. Shannon K.M. Acute leukemia: a pediatric perspective.Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 437-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, myeloid leukemias in older children and adults are much more likely to have mutations that activate the PI3-kinase pathway, including Bcr-Abl and Flt3 internal tandem duplications (Meshinchi et al., 2001Meshinchi S.

These observations raise the question of whether age-dependent changes in leukemia driver mutations occur because of developmental changes in signaling mechanisms that regulate self-renewal. The Pten tumor suppressor negatively regulates PI3-kinase pathway signaling and is commonly inactivated in many cancers (Di Cristofano and Pandolfi, 2000Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P.P.

Pten loss-of-function mutations occur frequently in T-precursor ALL (T-ALL) and Pten is inactivated in some acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) by mutations, promoter methylation, or transcriptional repression (Dahia et al., 1999Dahia P.L.

One possibility is that PI3-kinase pathway regulation changes over time in hematopoietic cells.

Pten deletion from adult mouse HSCs causes these cells to go into cycle and to be depleted by a tumor suppressor response induced by hyperactivation of mTOR (Yilmaz et al., 2006Yilmaz O.H. Valdez R.

Both leukemogenesis and HSC depletion after Pten deletion can be rescued by treating mice with rapamycin (Yilmaz et al., 2006Yilmaz O.H. Valdez R. Theisen B.K. Guo W. Ferguson D.O. Wu H.

This suggests that these phenotypes are mediated by RAPTOR/mTORC1 activation; however, rapamycin can also indirectly inhibit RICTOR/mTORC2 signaling (Sarbassov et al., 2006Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M.

Consequently, the relative contribution of mTORC1 and mTORC2 to these phenotypes is uncertain. It also remains unclear whether Pten deletion drives HSCs into cycle by activating physiological mechanisms that induce HSC division or by activating mechanisms that do not normally regulate HSC division. To address these questions we evaluated PTEN function, RICTOR/mTORC2 function, and PI3-kinase pathway activation in fetal, neonatal, and adult HSCs. AKT phosphorylation did not detectably increase in HSCs that divided under physiological conditions. Consistent with this, Rictor deletion had little effect on HSC frequency or function. However, Rictor deletion largely rescued the increased AKT phosphorylation, HSC depletion, and leukemogenesis observed after Pten deletion from adult HSCs. This suggests that Pten deletion promotes HSC proliferation by activating signaling pathways that have a limited role in HSC self-renewal under physiological conditions. The observation that Pten deletion provides no selective advantage to neonatal hematopoietic cells may explain why Pten mutations are rare in leukemias that affect young children. Temporal changes in the signaling mechanisms that regulate self-renewal lead to temporal changes in leukemogenic mechanisms. HSCs divide rapidly during fetal and neonatal development (Morrison et al., 1995Morrison S.J. Hemmati H.D. Wandycz A.M. Weissman I.L. The purification and characterization of fetal liver hematopoietic stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1995; 92: 10302-10306Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and after cyclophosphamide/G-CSF treatment (Morrison et al., 1997Morrison S.J. Wright D.E. Weissman I.L. Cyclophosphamide/granulocyte colony-stimulating factor induces hematopoietic stem cells to proliferate prior to mobilization.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 1908-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We compared the cell cycle status of HSCs (CD150+CD48−Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+) isolated from embryonic day (E)14.5 fetal mice, postnatal day (P)14 neonatal mice, 8-week-old adult mice, and mice that were treated with cyclophosphamide and two daily doses of G-CSF (Figures 1A and 1B ; Table S1 available online). We also administered poly-inosine:poly-cytosine (pIpC) to Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl mice 6 weeks after birth and isolated HSCs for cell cycle analysis at 8 weeks after birth. The fraction of HSCs in S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle decreased significantly from E14.5 to P14 to 8 weeks after birth (Figure 1B). The frequency of HSCs in S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle after cyclophosphamide/G-CSF treatment was significantly greater than after Pten deletion (Figure 1B). To assess whether AKT activation correlates with the frequency of HSCs/MPPs in cycle, we compared AKT phosphorylation between CD48−Lineage−Sca-1+c-Kit+ (CD48−LSK) HSCs/MPPs (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J.

The cell cycle distribution in the HSC/MPP population was similar to that of highly purified HSCs (Figure 1C), consistent with prior studies (Foudi et al., 2009Foudi A. Hochedlinger K. Van Buren D. Schindler J.W. Jaenisch R. Carey V. Hock H. Analysis of histone 2B-GFP retention reveals slowly cycling hematopoietic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). As expected, AKT and S6 were more highly phosphorylated in Pten-deficient adult HSCs/MPPs as compared to wild-type adult HSCs/MPPs (Figure 1D). However, phosphorylated AKT levels were lower in fetal and neonatal HSCs/MPPs compared to normal adult HSCs/MPPs (Figure 1D), even though fetal and neonatal HSCs/MPPs were more mitotically active (Figure 1C). Levels of phosphorylated S6 were higher in fetal HSCs/MPPs but lower in neonatal HSCs/MPPs as compared to adult HSCs/MPPs (Figure 1D). Phosphorylated AMPK and GSK3β levels did not significantly differ between fetal, neonatal, and adult HSCs/MPPs. Fetal HSCs/MPPs in G0/G1 versus S/G2/M phases of the cell cycle exhibited similar levels of AKT phosphorylation (Figure 1E). We next evaluated AKT and S6 phosphorylation in sorted HSCs/MPPs from the bone marrow of untreated or cyclophosphamide/G-CSF-treated 8-week-old adult mice. After cyclophosphamide and 2 days of G-CSF, HSCs/MPPs did not exhibit increased AKT or S6 phosphorylation (Figure 1F) despite the high percentage of cells in S/G2/M (Figures 1B and 1C). Granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (Lineage−c-kit+Sca-1−CD34+CD16/32+ cells; GMPs) from the same mice did have higher levels of phosphorylated AKT and S6 after cyclophosphamide/G-CSF treatment (Figure 1F). CD48−LSK cells were also harvested from the spleens of mice treated with cyclophosphamide and 4 days of G-CSF. HSCs/MPPs from these mice still did not exhibit increased AKT phosphorylation relative to normal adult HSCs, though an increase in 4EBP phosphorylation was observed (Figure 1G). Rapidly dividing HSCs therefore exhibit little or no increase in AKT phosphorylation relative to quiescent adult HSCs. To determine whether Pten regulates neonatal HSCs, we induced Cre in Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl mice by administering a single subcutaneous dose of pIpC 2 days after birth, resulting in complete Pten deletion in HSCs (Figure S1 available online). Bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was then administered for 24 hr before the mice were sacrificed (Figures 2A and 2B ). The overall proliferation of unfractionated bone marrow cells at 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks after birth was not affected by Pten deletion (Figure 2A). The overall rate of BrdU incorporation into control CD150+CD48−Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+ HSCs declined from 2 (25% ± 8.5%) to 5 (10% ± 6.8%) weeks after birth as HSCs made the transition to a more slowly dividing adult phenotype (Figure 2B). Pten deletion had no effect on BrdU incorporation into HSCs at 2 weeks after birth, but Pten-deficient HSCs showed a trend toward increased BrdU incorporation relative to control HSCs at 3 weeks after birth, and the effect was statistically significant at 4 and 5 weeks after birth (Figure 2B). To determine whether Pten deletion mobilizes neonatal HSCs, we administered pIpC to 2-day-old neonatal mice or to 6-week-old adult mice, then measured the number of HSCs per spleen at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after birth (Figure 2C). We observed a >40-fold increase in the number of HSCs in the spleens of 8-week-old adult mice (2 weeks after Pten deletion; Figure 2C). In contrast, Pten deletion had no effect on the number of HSCs in the spleen of 2-week-old mice and only modestly (but significantly) increased the number of HSCs in the spleens of 4-week-old mice (Figure 2C). We also did not observe any effect of Pten deletion on the overall proliferation of splenocytes until 4 weeks after birth (Figure 2D). Pten deletion therefore does not lead to increased HSC proliferation or mobilization until around 4 weeks after birth. We compared the reconstituting capacity of HSCs from neonatal and adult mice after Pten deletion at 2 days or 6 weeks after birth. We transplanted 10 CD45.2+ CD150+CD48−Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+ HSCs from donor mice of each age and genotype into irradiated CD45.1+ mice along with 300,000 wild-type CD45.1+ bone marrow cells. Control adult (Figures 2E and 2F) and neonatal (Figures 2G and 2H) HSCs gave long-term multilineage reconstitution by myeloid and lymphoid cells in all recipient mice. Pten-deficient adult HSCs gave only transient multilineage reconstitution that lasted less than 16 weeks after transplantation in all recipient mice (Figures 2E and 2F). Pten-deficient neonatal HSCs gave long-term multilineage reconstitution in most recipients that lasted at least 16 weeks after transplantation, but none of these recipients were multilineage reconstituted after 24 weeks (Figures 2G and 2H). Pten-deficient neonatal HSCs therefore retained the capacity to give long-term multilineage reconstitution, suggesting that they did not initially depend upon Pten. The ultimate depletion of Pten-deficient neonatal HSCs 16 to 24 weeks after transplantation presumably reflects their maturation into adult HSCs as fetal HSCs acquire an adult phenotype after transplantation into adult mice (Figures S1B and S1C). To test whether Pten deletion causes neoplastic proliferation in neonatal mice, we treated littermate control and Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl mice with pIpC at 2 days or 6 weeks after birth. Two weeks after pIpC treatment was performed, we observed a 3-fold increase in spleens' cellularity and weight in adult, but not neonatal, Pten-deleted mice (Figures 2I and 2J). We also observed histological signs of myeloproliferative disorder in adult, but not neonatal, spleen after Pten deletion. Two weeks after Pten deletion in adult mice, spleens exhibited a substantial expansion of the red pulp and extramedullary hematopoiesis consistent with myeloproliferative disorder (Figures 2K and 2L). Two weeks after Pten deletion in neonatal mice, spleens had qualitatively fewer follicles than spleens from littermate controls (data not shown), consistent with the reduction in B cells in neonatal Pten-deficient mice (Figures 4J and 4K). Otherwise, the histological appearance of neonatal Pten-deficient and control spleens was indistinguishable (Figures 2M and 2N). Pten is therefore not required to prevent myeloproliferative disorder in neonatal mice. When Pten is deleted from young adult mice they succumb to T-ALL by 12 weeks after Cre induction (Yilmaz et al., 2006Yilmaz O.H. Valdez R. Theisen B.K. Guo W. Ferguson D.O. Wu H. Morrison S.J.

This latency period makes it difficult to test whether Pten deletion is leukemogenic in neonatal mice because they would mature into adults before the onset of leukemia; therefore, to test whether Pten is a tumor suppressor in neonatal mice, we deleted Pten from p53-deficient mice. In adult mice this greatly accelerates leukemogenesis (Lee et al., 2010Lee J.Y. Nakada D. Yilmaz O.H. Tothova Z. Joseph N.M. Lim M.S. Gilliland D.G. Morrison S.J. mTOR activation induces tumor suppressors that inhibit leukemogenesis and deplete hematopoietic stem cells after Pten deletion.Cell Stem Cell. 2010; 7: 593-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This allowed us to test whether neonatal mice are immediately competent to develop leukemia after Pten deletion or whether an adult developmental context is required. We administered pIpC to Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl; p53−/− mice and littermate controls (that lacked Mx1-Cre) at 2 days or 6 weeks after birth. By 20 days after pIpC treatment, all adult Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl; p53−/− mice died with signs of leukemia (Figure 3A). Control p53−/− or p53+/− adult mice that retained Pten all survived for at least 100 days with no evidence of hematopoietic neoplasms (Figures 3A and 3B). All moribund adult Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl; p53−/− mice had large mediastinal masses and infiltrative precursor T-ALL (Figures 3E–3H). Adult Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl; p53−/− mice therefore developed T-ALL and died within 20 days of pIpC. At 21 days after pIpC treatment, when all of the adult Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl; p53−/− mice were dead, none of the neonatal Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl; p53−/− mice that had been treated with pIpC at 2 days of age showed any signs of illness (Figure 3A). These mice did not die until 44 to 60 days after pIpC treatment, when they were 6- to 8-week-old adults (Figure 3A). Indeed, the Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl; p53−/− mice died at the same time after birth irrespective of whether pIpC was administered at 2 days or 6 weeks after birth (Figure 3C). When neonatal Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl; p53−/− mice were sacrificed at 17 days after pIpC treatment (a time point at which all adult Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl; p53−/− mice showed clear signs of T-ALL), none of the neonatally treated mice showed any signs of illness or leukemia: they had normal thymus and spleen histology (Figures 3I–3L); however, when these mice became ill approximately 50 days after pIpC treatment, they had large mediastinal masses and infiltrative T-ALL (Figures 3M–3P). The observation that Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl; p53−/− mice succumbed to leukemia at the same time, irrespective of whether Pten was deleted 2 days or 6 weeks after birth (Figure 3C), demonstrates that an adult developmental context is required for leukemia after Pten deletion. We performed similar experiments in mice with a p53 heterozygous background and obtained similar results (Figures 3B and 3D). To test whether Pten is required in neonatal HSCs to regulate PI3-kinase pathway signaling, we administered pIpC to Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl mice or littermate controls at 2 days or 6 weeks after birth. We isolated CD48−LSK cells 2 weeks later and performed western blots. The total levels of PTEN, AKT, S6, and GSK3β were similar in neonatal and adult HSCs/MPPs from control mice (Figures 4A and 4B ). In both the neonatal and adult HSCs/MPPs, we observed a complete loss of PTEN protein from Mx1-Cre; Ptenfl/fl cells (Figures 4A and 4B). In adult HSCs/MPPs, Pten deletion increased the phosphorylation of AKT, S6, and GSK3β, but not MAPK or AMPK (Figures 4A and 4B). In neonatal HSCs/MPPs, Pten deletion had little or no affect on AKT, S6, and GSK3β phosphorylation (Figures 4A and 4B). Pten deletion did not increase AKT phosphorylation in HSCs/MPPs until 3 to 4 weeks after birth (Figure 4C), the same time we began to observe increased HSC proliferation after Pten deletion (Figure 2B). To determine whether neonatal HSCs/MPPs are capable of activating the PI3-kinase pathway, we incubated neo"

To discern how Set3C affects gene expression, genome-wide transcription was analyzed in yeast undergoing a series of carbon source shifts. Deleting SET3 primarily caused changes during transition periods, as genes were induced or repressed. Surprisingly, a majority of Set3-affected genes are overlapped by noncoding RNA (ncRNA) transcription. Many Set3-repressed genes have H3K4me2 instead of me3 over promoter regions, due to either reduced H3K4me3 or ncRNA transcription from distal or antisense promoters. Set3C also represses internal cryptic promoters, but in different regions of genes than the Set2/Rpd3S pathway. Finally, Set3C stimulates some genes by repressing an overlapping antagonistic antisense transcript. These results show that overlapping noncoding transcription can fine-tune gene expression, not via the ncRNA but by depositing H3K4me2 to recruit the Set3C deacetylase."
https://openalex.org/W2069783754,"Expression of GluN2 subunit of NMDA receptor (NMDAR) in rodents is developmentally regulated such that GluN2B expression is high during early postnatal period but is replaced by GluN2A in adulthood, thus conferring different NMDAR channel properties and kinetics. This study identifies a molecular mechanism for GluN2A/B switch that is mediated by the transcriptional repressor REST. This process is also shown to be affected by postnatal stress induced by maternal deprivation, leading to long-lasting effects on NMDAR-subunit composition in the hippocampus. NMDA receptors (NMDARs) are critical to synaptogenesis, neural circuitry and higher cognitive functions. A hallmark feature of NMDARs is an early postnatal developmental switch from those containing primarily GluN2B to primarily GluN2A subunits. Although the switch in phenotype has been an area of intense interest for two decades, the mechanisms that trigger it and the link between experience and the switch are unclear. Here we show a new role for the transcriptional repressor REST in the developmental switch of synaptic NMDARs. REST is activated at a critical window of time and acts via epigenetic remodeling to repress Grin2b expression and alter NMDAR properties at rat hippocampal synapses. Knockdown of REST in vivo prevented the decline in GluN2B and developmental switch in NMDARs. Maternal deprivation impaired REST activation and acquisition of the mature NMDAR phenotype. Thus, REST is essential for experience-dependent fine-tuning of genes involved in synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2015292331,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway serves as a key sensor of cellular-energetic state and functions to maintain tissue homeostasis. Hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway impairs hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function and is associated with leukemogenesis. However, the roles of the unique mTOR complexes (mTORCs) in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis have not been adequately elucidated. We deleted the mTORC1 component, regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (Raptor), in mouse HSCs and its loss causes a nonlethal phenotype characterized by pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and the accumulation of monocytoid cells. Furthermore, Raptor is required for HSC regeneration, and plays largely nonredundant roles with rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor) in these processes. Ablation of Raptor also significantly extends survival of mice in models of leukemogenesis evoked by Pten deficiency. These data delineate critical roles for mTORC1 in hematopoietic function and leukemogenesis and inform clinical strategies based on chronic mTORC1 inhibition."

The comparison of diabetes prevalence between this and a 1990 study used the 1985 WHO diabetes criteria.There were 1099 participants, 392 men and 707 women (response rate 86%). The age-standardised (SEGI) prevalence of diabetes was 13.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.0-15.1), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) 11.2% (9.2-13.1) and impaired fasting glycaemia 1.2% (0.6-1.9). Diabetes prevalence peaked in 65-74-year-olds (38.6%). Among diabetic participants, 57.9% were known and 38.6% treated.

https://openalex.org/W2135176038,"Peter Donnelly and colleagues report a genome-wide association study for Barrett's esophagus, a common premalignant condition associated with stomach acid reflux and predisposing to esophageal adenocarcinoma. They identify two loci associated with susceptibility to Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus is an increasingly common disease that is strongly associated with reflux of stomach acid and usually a hiatus hernia, and it strongly predisposes to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a tumor with a very poor prognosis. We report the first genome-wide association study on Barrett's esophagus, comprising 1,852 UK cases and 5,172 UK controls in the discovery stage and 5,986 cases and 12,825 controls in the replication stage. Variants at two loci were associated with disease risk: chromosome 6p21, rs9257809 (Pcombined = 4.09 × 10−9; odds ratio (OR) = 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) =1.13–1.28), within the major histocompatibility complex locus, and chromosome 16q24, rs9936833 (Pcombined = 2.74 × 10−10; OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.10–1.19), for which the closest protein-coding gene is FOXF1, which is implicated in esophageal development and structure. We found evidence that many common variants of small effect contribute to genetic susceptibility to Barrett's esophagus and that SNP alleles predisposing to obesity also increase risk for Barrett's esophagus."

Griswold M.D. Sertoli Cell Biology. Elsevier Academic Press, Amsterdam, Boston2005Google Scholar). In the mouse XY gonad, eSC differentiation is initiated by the expression of the testis-determining gene, Sry, within the genital ridge at 10.5 days postcoitum (dpc) (Koopman et al., 1990Koopman P. Münsterberg A. Capel B. Vivian N. Lovell-Badge R. Expression of a candidate sex-determining gene during mouse testis differentiation.Nature. 1990; 348: 450-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Upon induction of Sry, a cascade of molecular signaling events and developmental processes occur to ensure proper testis development. Expression of Sox9, a target gene of Sry, in gonadal somatic cells is sufficient to induce the differentiation of eSCs even in the absence of Sry (Sekido and Lovell-Badge, 2008Sekido R. Lovell-Badge R. Sex determination involves synergistic action of SRY and SF1 on a specific Sox9 enhancer.Nature. 2008; 453: 930-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar; Vidal et al., 2001Vidal V.P. Chaboissier M.C. de Rooij D.G. Schedl A. Sox9 induces testis development in XX transgenic mice.Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 216-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). One morphologically distinct event in testis development is the aggregation and rearrangement of the eSCs and primordial germ cells (PGCs) to form testicular cords. For cellular aggregation to occur, eSCs must differentiate and undergo mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and polarization (Skinner and Griswold, 2005Skinner M.K. Griswold M.D. Sertoli Cell Biology. Elsevier Academic Press, Amsterdam, Boston2005Google Scholar). Accumulation of various extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as laminin and collagen, has been shown to induce eSC polarization (Skinner and Griswold, 2005Skinner M.K. Griswold M.D. Sertoli Cell Biology. Elsevier Academic Press, Amsterdam, Boston2005Google Scholar). As the cords develop, eSCs attract cells from the coelomic epithelium and from the mesonephros such as endothelial cells. Endothelial cells migrate into the gonad in a male-specific manner and contribute to the characteristic male pattern of vasculature (Brennan et al., 2002Brennan J. Karl J. Capel B. Divergent vascular mechanisms downstream of Sry establish the arterial system in the XY gonad.Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although the basic events in Sertoli cell development have been defined, the key transcription factors that mediate each of these processes are still unknown. In the adult, proper spermatogenesis is dependent on Sertoli cells, which are in constant and intimate interaction with all stages of the differentiating germ cells inside the seminiferous tubules. The main role of mature Sertoli cells is to provide support and nutrition to the developing sperm cells. Furthermore, Sertoli cells have been demonstrated to possess trophic properties, which have been utilized for the protection of nontesticular cellular grafts in transplantations (Mital et al., 2010Mital P. Kaur G. Dufour J.M. Immunoprotective sertoli cells: making allogeneic and xenogeneic transplantation feasible.Reproduction. 2010; 139: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, mature Sertoli cells are mitotically inactive, and the primary immature Sertoli cells during prolonged cultures lose their unique characteristics (Skinner and Griswold, 2005Skinner M.K. Griswold M.D. Sertoli Cell Biology. Elsevier Academic Press, Amsterdam, Boston2005Google Scholar). Therefore, finding an alternative source of these cells independent of donor testis cells is of paramount interest both for basic research and clinical applications. Although it has been shown recently that Sertoli-like cells can be derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), the efficiency and purity of the differentiating Sertoli cells remain a barrier (Bucay et al., 2009Bucay N. Yebra M. Cirulli V. Afrikanova I. Kaido T. Hayek A. Montgomery A.M. A novel approach for the derivation of putative primordial germ cells and sertoli cells from human embryonic stem cells.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Here we show that concomitant expression of Nr5a1, Wt1, Dmrt1, Gata4, and Sox9 efficiently reprogrammed mouse fibroblasts into induced embryonic Sertoli-like cells (ieSCs). While the expression of Nr5a1, Wt1, and Dmrt1 promoted proliferation and initiated MET, the combination of Nr5a1, Wt1, and Sox9 stimulated cell aggregation. ieSCs exhibited migratory potential, formed tubular-like structures, recruited endothelial cells, facilitated embryonic cortical progenitor self-renewal and differentiation, expressed eSC-specific markers, facilitated germ cell survival in culture, and interacted with endogenous eSCs and PGCs in gonad cultures. Primary immature Sertoli cells were cultured for 30 days and examined for changes in morphology and expression of key immature Sertoli cell markers. During the first few days of culture, the cells kept epithelial morphology and displayed Sertoli cell characteristics as indicated by high expression of the Sertoli markers Nr5a1, Dmrt1, Gata4, Sox9, Amh, Shbg, Ptgds, Clu, Erbb4, and Gdnf and the epithelial marker Krt18 (Figures S1A–S1D available online). With prolonged culture, however, loss of marker expression, loss of epithelial morphology, and acquisition of fibroblastic morphology with expression of Thy1 and Col5a2 occurred (Figures S1B and S1E), which is similar to the changes seen in the most studied immature Sertoli cell line TM4 (Figures S1B and S1F). In contrast to TM4, the primary Sertoli cells maintained relatively high levels of several other Sertoli markers like Aldh1a1, Dhh, Kitl, and Wt1 for at least 30 days when compared to mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (Figure S1G). These results suggest that primary Sertoli cells can retain their full properties in vitro only for several days. Based on the enrichment of their binding sites within the promoters of several known markers of Sertoli cells using the MatInspector software (Cartharius et al., 2005Cartharius K. Frech K. Grote K. Klocke B. Haltmeier M. Klingenhoff A. Frisch M. Bayerlein M. Werner T. MatInspector and beyond: promoter analysis based on transcription factor binding sites.Bioinformatics. 2005; 21: 2933-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1637) Google Scholar), we screened nine transcription factors to reprogram fibroblasts into ieSCs: Nr5a1, Wt1, Dmrt1, Gata4, Sox9, Gata1, Spz1, Smad3, and Zfp239 (Figure S2A). One of the initial steps in eSC differentiation is the transformation from mesenchymal-like cells to epithelial-like cells (Nel-Themaat et al., 2011Nel-Themaat L. Jang C.W. Stewart M.D. Akiyama H. Viger R.S. Behringer R.R. Sertoli cell behaviors in developing testis cords and postnatal seminiferous tubules of the mouse.Biol. Reprod. 2011; 84: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The factors that control MET in eSCs are unknown, but are thought to be induced by Sry. To unravel which of the Sertoli cell factors can initiate MET in fibroblasts, we introduced the nine factors into MEFs using the doxycycline (dox)-inducible lentiviral system and monitored generation of epithelial foci-like morphology within the culture, which appeared within 1 week of dox treatment (Figure 1A). To determine which of the nine factors are essential for initiating MET, we removed individual genes from the pool of factors and found that the removal of Nr5a1 or Wt1 or Dmrt1 impaired significantly the ability to generate epithelial foci (Figure 1B). Accordingly, introduction of Nr5a1, Wt1, and Dmrt1 in MEFs (MEFsNWD) (Figure 1C) or tail tip fibroblasts (TTFsNWD) from both sexes (Figure 1D) rapidly initiated MET. Expression of an individual factor (Nr5a1 or Wt1 or Dmrt1) was not sufficient to induce MET (Figure S2B). To assess whether genes known to affect MET were differentially expressed between MEFs and MEFsNWD, we performed cDNA microarray on MEFs, MEFsNWD, and immature Sertoli and mature Sertoli cells. We found that genes that block the MET process and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) such as Twist1, Snai1, Snai2, Foxc2, Lef1, Gsc, and Mmp3 were significantly downregulated in MEFsNWD and immature and mature Sertoli cells as compared to MEFs (Figure 1E). Also, three mesenchymal markers (Cdh2, Vim, and Fn1) were inhibited and three epithelial markers (Muc1, Dsp, and Cdh1) were upregulated. We confirmed the microarray results by qRT-PCR and immunostaining (Figures 1F, 1G, and S2C). Nr5a1, Wt1, and Dmrt1 also promoted the proliferation of the induced epithelial cells as indicated by colony forming experiments and BrdU staining (Figures 1H, 1I, and S2D). Additionally, we observed an increase in the levels of endogenous Sox9 in the transduced cells (Figure S2E). These data suggest that Nr5a1, Wt1, and Dmrt1 promote proliferation, induce low Sox9 expression, and initiate MET, all characteristics of proliferating coelomic epithelium, one of the precursors of eSCs (Karl and Capel, 1998Karl J. Capel B. Sertoli cells of the mouse testis originate from the coelomic epithelium.Dev. Biol. 1998; 203: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar; Morais da Silva et al., 1996Morais da Silva S. Hacker A. Harley V. Goodfellow P. Swain A. Lovell-Badge R. Sox9 expression during gonadal development implies a conserved role for the gene in testis differentiation in mammals and birds.Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). We asked whether the nine factors can induce cell aggregation as is seen in vivo with eSCs in the gonad and in vitro with endogenous Sertoli cells (Gassei et al., 2008Gassei K. Ehmcke J. Schlatt S. Initiation of testicular tubulogenesis is controlled by neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinases in a three-dimensional Sertoli cell aggregation assay.Reproduction. 2008; 136: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cell aggregates were observed in factor-transduced cells 3 weeks after dox addition (Figure 2A). To dissect which of the factors were responsible for generating cell aggregates, we removed individual genes from the pool and measured aggregate formation (Figure 2B). Removal of Nr5a1, Wt1, or Sox9 impaired significantly their ability to aggregate, and transduction of these factors into MEFs (MEFsNWS) or TTFs (TTFsNWS) resulted in the generation of cell aggregates 2 weeks postinfection (Figure 2C). When the three factors were introduced into keratinocytes (KrtsNWS), which lack the intrinsic capability to aggregate, aggregates were detected within 3 weeks (Figure 2C). Endogenous immature and mature Sertoli cells formed cell aggregates within 3 days of culture (Figure 2C). Because Sox9 is a key developmental regulator of chondrocytes and osteoblasts (Akiyama et al., 2005Akiyama H. Kim J.E. Nakashima K. Balmes G. Iwai N. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Martin J.F. Behringer R.R. Nakamura T. de Crombrugghe B. Osteo-chondroprogenitor cells are derived from Sox9 expressing precursors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 14665-14670Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) that have the capability to aggregate in culture, we measured the expression levels of several osteoblastic and chondrocytic markers in MEFsNWS and found no elevation in their expression (Figure 2D). Our results suggest that Nr5a1, Wt1, and Sox9 promote cell aggregation. Since Gata4 has been shown to drive eSC differentiation (Manuylov et al., 2007Manuylov N.L. Fujiwara Y. Adameyko I.I. Poulat F. Tevosian S.G. The regulation of Sox9 gene expression by the GATA4/FOG2 transcriptional complex in dominant XX sex reversal mouse models.Dev. Biol. 2007; 307: 356-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and promote transdifferentiation of cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes (Huang et al., 2011Huang P. He Z. Ji S. Sun H. Xiang D. Liu C. Hu Y. Wang X. Hui L. Induction of functional hepatocyte-like cells from mouse fibroblasts by defined factors.Nature. 2011; 475: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar; Ieda et al., 2010Ieda M. Fu J.D.

Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes by defined factors.Cell. 2010; 142: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), we included it in the cocktail of the selected four factors (Nr5a1, Wt1, Dmrt1, and Sox9). Transduction of the five factors into MEFs (MEFsNWDG4S) (Figure 3A) or TTFs (TTFsNWDG4S) from both sexes resulted in epithelial foci after 2 weeks (Figures 3B). Since eSC polarization requires basement membrane attachment (Mackay et al., 1999Mackay S. Booth S.H. MacGowan A. Smith R.A. Ultrastructural studies demonstrate that epithelial polarity is established in cultured mouse pre-Sertoli cells by extracellular matrix components.J. Electron Microsc. (Tokyo). 1999; 48: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), long-term culture was done on Matrigel (Figure 3C). We observed that very high levels of transgenes in MEFs (MEFsNWDG4S-high) (Figure S3A) upregulated several Leydig-cell-specific markers, such as Hsd3b1, Hsd3b6, Dhcr7, and Cyp11a1, along with some germ cell markers like Dazl and Tdrd6 (Figures S3B and S3C). Since Nr5a1 is a steroidogenic factor and a key regulator of Leydig cells and since Dmrt1 is expressed in germ cells as well, it is tempting to speculate that the extremely high levels of Nr5a1 and Dmrt1 in MEFsNWDG4S-high are responsible for the nonspecific induction of these genes. None of these genes were upregulated in cells with lower transgene expression (MEFsNWDG4S-low). Also, high activation levels of endogenous Nr5a1, Wt1, and Dmrt1 were observed in MEFsNWDG4S-low compared to MEFsNWDG4S-high and MEFs (Figure S3D). These results suggest that controlled levels of transgenes are crucial for proper transdifferentiation. To test whether the morphology of the ieSCs (i.e., MEFsNWDG4S-low after culturing on Matrigel) was similar to endogenous Sertoli cells, we cocultured ieSCs transduced with the H2b-GFP construct (Beronja et al., 2010Beronja S. Livshits G. Williams S. Fuchs E. Rapid functional dissection of genetic networks via tissue-specific transduction and RNAi in mouse embryos.Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with freshly isolated endogenous immature Sertoli cells for 2 days. The morphology of the ieSCs was comparable to that of endogenous immature Sertoli cells (Figure 3D), integrating into the colonies formed by the endogenous cells in contrast to H2b-GFP-MEFs (Figure S3E). As opposed to MEFsNWD, ieSCs expressed the mesenchymal Sertoli markers Vim, Cdh2, Sparc, and Fn1 at a level comparable to that of immature and mature Sertoli cells (Figure 3E). Epithelial morphology of the cells was consistent with high expression of eSC epithelial markers Krt18, Dsp, Ocln, and Cgn (Figures S4A and S4B). These results suggest that ieSCs underwent MET and retained proper epithelial Sertoli cell characteristics. Proliferation of eSCs is essential for testis morphogenesis with rapid proliferation beginning as early as 11.5 dpc (Schmahl et al., 2000Schmahl J. Eicher E.M. Washburn L.L. Capel B. Sry induces cell proliferation in the mouse gonad.Development. 2000; 127: 65-73PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with that, ieSCs exhibited colony forming capability (Figure 3F), high proliferation rate (Figure 3G), and high percentage of cells (28%) in S phase (Figures 3H). Also, in contrast to MEFs, we found decreased expression of the Cdk inhibitors Cdkn2b, Cdkn2a, and Cdkn1a in ieSCs, immature Sertoli cells, and, to a lesser extent, the mature Sertoli cells, (Figures 3I and 3J) consistent with their high proliferative capacity. We next compared gene expression profiles of MEFs, TTFs, ieSCs (derived from MEFs), ieSCs (derived from female TTFs), 14.5 dpc male gonad, and immature and mature Sertoli cells using cDNA microarray. Hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that the transcriptome profiles of ieSCs were more similar to each other and to the endogenous Sertoli cells than to the donor fibroblasts (Figure 4A), but not identical. Because the isolated 14.5 dpc male gonad contained, in addition to the eSCs, high numbers of germ, Leydig, and peritubular myoid cells, we focused our analysis on the expression of 200 eSC markers identified mainly in two studies that sorted eSCs from 10.5–13.5 embryos (Bouma et al., 2010Bouma G.J. Hudson Q.J. Washburn L.L. Eicher E.M. New candidate genes identified for controlling mouse gonadal sex determination and the early stages of granulosa and Sertoli cell differentiation.Biol. Reprod. 2010; 82: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar; Boyer et al., 2004Boyer A. Lussier J.G. Sinclair A.H. McClive P.J. Silversides D.W.

Reprod. 2004; 71: 820-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Notably, hierarchical clustering analysis (Figure 4B), principle component analysis (PCA) (Figure 4C), and scatter plots (Figure 4D) showed that ieSCs were clustered together with the 14.5 dpc male gonad, and far from MEFs, TTFs, and immature and mature Sertoli cells. To confirm the microarray results, we used 14.5 dpc female gonads as a negative control and found that Ptgds, Dhh, Gdnf, Vnn1, Cyp26b1, Col9a1, and Erbb4 were upregulated mostly in ieSCs and in male 14.5 dpc gonad but not in immature or mature Sertoli cells, female 14.5 gonads, or MEF controls (Figure 4E). Expression of Aldh1a1 and Cited1 was high in ieSCs, lower in female 14.5 gonads, and absent in MEFs (Figure 4F). Kitl, which is important for germ cell survival (Yan et al., 2000Yan W. Suominen J. Toppari J. Stem cell factor protects germ cells from apoptosis in vitro.J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 161-168PubMed Google Scholar), and the epithelial marker Cgn were upregulated in all of the groups, but not in MEFs (Figure 4F). Furthermore, the secretion of the Amh hormone was observed in the ieSC culture (Figure 4G). In contrast, expression of Fgf9, which is upregulated in eSCs and forms a positive feedback loop with Sox9, was low in ieSCs (Figure 4F). The embryonic female-specific genes Irx3, Adm, and Dclk1 were downregulated in 14.5 dpc male gonad and in ieSCs (Figure 4H). Consistent with acquiring an embryonic Sertoli cell-like transcriptional profile, ieSCs showed reduced MEF-specific marker expression (Figure 4I). A clear difference in the transcriptional profile between ieSC lines and MEFs was observed also after 2 weeks of dox withdrawal, suggesting that the ieSCs reached at least partially a stable state that is transgene independent (Figure S4C). Importantly, ieSCs in the absence of dox retained relatively high levels of Aldh1a1, Dhh, Kitl, and Wt1 (Figure S4D) similarly to endogenous immature Sertoli cells during prolong culturing (Figure S1G). Cytogenetic analysis of ieSCs cultured for 17 passages revealed that they exhibited normal karyotype with 40 chromosomes in 15 of the 17 analyzed metaphases (Figure 4J). Combined, these results show that the ieSCs expressed a specific eSC profile and maintained normal chromosome numbers. Since some endogenous eSCs migrate from the coelomic epithelium to the gonad and continue their migration inside the gonad to generate testicular cords, we tested whether ieSCs have a potential to migrate. H2b-GFP-MEFs, H2b-GFP-ieSCs, and H2b-GFP-immature Sertoli cells were seeded on a microporous membrane (8 μM) Boyden chamber that contained serum-free medium in the upper part and 10% FBS medium in the lower part. The number of GFP-positive cells that had migrated through the membrane to the lower side within 24 hr was significantly higher for ieSCs and immature Sertoli cells than for MEFs (Figure 5A). Cell motility assay for ieSCs and MEFs following serum stimulation for 24 hr revealed high motility capability for ieSCs (Movie S1, Movie S2, Movie S3, and Movie S4). These results suggest that the ieSCs have migratory potential resembling that of eSCs. eSCs and PGCs aggregate in the fetal gonad. Similarly, when cells were cultured at a high density single cell suspension, ieSCs formed aggregates within 3 hr in contrast to MEFs (Figure 5B) with the shape and density closely resembling those of freshly isolated immature Sertoli cells (Figure 5C). eSC polarization and aggregation is thought to be mediated by ECM proteins such as Col4a and Lama1 (Davis et al., 1990Davis C.M. Papadopoulos V. Sommers C.L. Kleinman H.K. Dym M. Differential expression of extracellular matrix components in rat Sertoli cells.Biol. Reprod. 1990; 43: 860-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar; Skinner and Griswold, 2005Skinner M.K. Griswold M.D. Sertoli Cell Biology. Elsevier Academic Press, Amsterdam, Boston2005Google Scholar), both of which were highly enriched in the ECM produced by ieSCs, in contrast to MEFs (Figure 5D). Endothelial cell migration and induction of peritubular myloid cells are two fundamental processes in the generation of the testicular cords. Migration of endothelial cells has been suggested to be mediated by eSCs and undifferentiated mesenchyme (Brennan et al., 2002Brennan J. Karl J. Capel B. Divergent vascular mechanisms downstream of Sry establish the arterial system in the XY gonad.Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 418-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar; Cool et al., 2011Cool J. DeFalco T.J. Capel B. Vascular-mesenchymal cross-talk through Vegf and Pdgf drives organ patterning.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To test whether the ieSCs can attract endothelial cells, we employed the Boyden chamber-based cell migration assay (8 μM pore) and found after 4 hr a 2-fold higher cell number of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in conditioned medium from ieSCs than in conditioned medium from MEFs (Figure S5). To test whether ieSCs can form tubule-like structures, we cultured immature Sertoli cells on Matrigel, which can induce cell aggregation and 3D hollowed cord-like structures (Gassei et al., 2006Gassei K. Schlatt S. Ehmcke J. De novo morphogenesis of seminiferous tubules from dissociated immature rat testicular cells in xenografts.J. Androl. 2006; 27: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Figures 5E, S6A, and S6B show that ieSCs, when cultured on Matrigel with or without dox for 3 days in 10% FBS, formed spherical cellular aggregates. These 3D cord-like structures were hollowed like a tubule and generated a highly regular hexagonal array in the Matrigel. When the cells were cultured on Matrigel in 2% FBS, web-like structures were formed, consistent with the initiation of tubulogenesis (Figure 5F). Sparsely seeded cultures generated highly organized ring-like structures (Figure 5G) and, in the absence of Matrigel, dense cultures formed occasionally complete 3D tubules with a structure similar to that of testicular tubules (Figure 5H). Finally, to examine whether ieSCs can form tubule-like structures in vivo in a dox-independent manner, we transplanted subcutaneously a pellet of H2b-GFP-ieSCs together with an extract from immature testis into NOD/SCID mice. Three weeks later the transplant was fixed and stained for GFP, demonstrating the formation of tubular-like structures arising from GFP-positive cells (Figure 5I). In contrast, no contribution of H2b-GFP-MEFs to tubules was seen (data not shown). In summary, our data suggest that ieSCs can migrate, aggregate, recruit endothelial cells, and incorporate into tubule-like structures. To test whether ieSCs can support germ cell survival, testicular cells from 1-day-old postnatal pups were cultured either alone or with MEFs or ieSCs. One week later, the plates were fixed and stained for the germ cell marker Ddx4 (Vasa). A significantly higher number of Ddx4-positive cells were observed in the ieSC coculture as compared to coculture with MEFs or testicular suspension alone, indicating that ieSCs can support germ cell survival in vitro, which is consistent with their role in development (Figures 6A and 6B ). Because Gdnf has been shown to facilitate germ cell survival (Sariola and Immonen, 2008Sariola H. Immonen T. GDNF maintains mouse spermatogonial stem cells in vivo and in vitro.Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 450: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and is highly expressed in eSCs, we measured its expression after 7 days of culture. While ieSCs exhibited high levels of Gdnf with and without dox, immature Sertoli cells expressed low levels comparable to that in MEFs (Figure 6C). It has been shown previously that the trophic effect of Sertoli cells, transplanted into animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, can rescue some of the neural phenotypes (Huang et al., 2010Huang H. Chen L. Sanberg P. Cell Therapy From Bench to Bedside Translation in CNS Neurorestoratology Era.Cell Med. 2010; 1: 15-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trophic factors including Gdnf, Nrtn, Tgfα, Tgfβ, Igf1, Pdgfα, Pdgfβ, Il1α, Il6, Cntf, and Dhh have been reported to exert this trophic effect and to stimulate self-renewal of neural progenitors and neuronal differentiation (Roussa et al., 2006Roussa E.

Moreover, ieSC conditioned medium facilitated neuronal differentiation of the cortical progenitors as evidenced by an elevation of Tubb3 (Tuj1)-positive cells with elongated neuronal branches (Figures 6D and 6E), in contrast to MEF conditioned medium"
https://openalex.org/W2034100391,"Live attenuated SIV vaccines protect nonhuman primates from infection with pathogenic wild-type SIV, but the crucial mechanisms have not been clear. In this issue, Louis Picker and colleagues show that protection by live attenuated vaccines against intravenous SIV challenge in rhesus macaques is associated with SIV-specific T cell response in the lymph nodes, and not the blood, and persistent SIV replication in lymph node follicular T helper cells. Live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccines (LAVs) remain the most efficacious of all vaccines in nonhuman primate models of HIV and AIDS, yet the basis of their robust protection remains poorly understood. Here we show that the degree of LAV-mediated protection against intravenous wild-type SIVmac239 challenge strongly correlates with the magnitude and function of SIV-specific, effector-differentiated T cells in the lymph node but not with the responses of such T cells in the blood or with other cellular, humoral and innate immune parameters. We found that maintenance of protective T cell responses is associated with persistent LAV replication in the lymph node, which occurs almost exclusively in follicular helper T cells. Thus, effective LAVs maintain lymphoid tissue-based, effector-differentiated, SIV-specific T cells that intercept and suppress early wild-type SIV amplification and, if present in sufficient frequencies, can completely control and perhaps clear infection, an observation that provides a rationale for the development of safe, persistent vectors that can elicit and maintain such responses."

Found in approximately 23% of AML cases, an ITD mutation abrogates the negative regulatory function of the juxtamembrane domain, rendering the receptor constitutively active, independent of its natural ligand (Fenski et al., 2000Fenski R.

Though there are many small molecule FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in various stages of clinical trials, responses have been largely heterogeneous and transient (Grundler et al., 2003Grundler R.

After an initial response, patients relapse, suggesting that leukemia-initiating stem cells may be escaping TKI-induced cytotoxicity. There has been increasing evidence linking FLT3-ITD with leukemic stem cells (LSCs), including the presence of the mutation within the CD34+/CD38− leukemia-initiating cell fraction in most cases (Lapidot et al., 1994Lapidot T.

The FLT3-ITD mutation also remains present at relapse in most cases, suggesting its presence in the cells that escape therapy (Cloos et al., 2006Cloos J. Goemans B.F. Hess C.J. van Oostveen J.W.

Furthermore, AML cases that have the FLT3-ITD mutation were shown to have the highest engraftment capacity in NOD/SCID mice (Lumkul et al., 2002Lumkul R. Gorin N.C. Malehorn M.T. Hoehn G.T. Zheng R.

Identification of variables determining the engraftment potential of human acute myeloid leukemia in the immunodeficient NOD/SCID human chimera model.Leukemia. 2000; 14: 889-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the role of FLT3-ITD mutations in LSCs is of great therapeutic interest. FLT3 is an important molecule in normal hematopoietic development as well as in leukemia (Gilliland and Griffin, 2002Gilliland D.G. Griffin J.D. The roles of FLT3 in hematopoiesis and leukemia.Blood. 2002; 100: 1532-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). FLT3 is expressed on common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) and a minor fraction of common myeloid progenitors (CMPs) and is implicated in dendritic cell development (D’Amico and Wu, 2003D’Amico A. Wu L. The early progenitors of mouse dendritic cells and plasmacytoid predendritic cells are within the bone marrow hemopoietic precursors expressing Flt3.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Additionally, FLT3 is expressed during the early stages of hematopoiesis, indicating a potential involvement in stem cell function or maintenance. In murine hematopoiesis, where cell surface marker expression during stages of differentiation has been extremely well-defined, hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activity is restricted to a small subset of the Lin− c-kit+ Sca-1+ (KSL) compartment (Ikuta and Weissman, 1992Ikuta K.

Yet, within this compartment, FLT3 is thought to be expressed only on multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs) (Christensen and Weissman, 2001Christensen J.L. Weissman I.L.

Of the KSLs, MPPs have the lowest capacity for self-renewal and higher rates of proliferation (Passegué et al., 2005Passegué E. Wagers A.J. Giuriato S. Anderson W.C. Weissman I.L. Global analysis of proliferation and cell cycle gene expression in the regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell fates.J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 1599-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), while the compartment defined as FLT3− contains HSCs capable of short-term (CD34+) or long-term (CD34−) reconstitution of all hematopoietic lineages (Morrison and Weissman, 1994Morrison S.J.

Lund F.E. Howard M.C. Weissman I.L. Expression of murine CD38 defines a population of long-term reconstituting hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 1996; 87: 4057-4067PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the most primitive stem cell in the murine hematopoietic hierarchy, the long-term HSC (LT-HSC), has been classically defined by its lack of FLT3 expression. FLT3 has been previously reported to be dispensable for HSC maintenance and myeloid development (Sitnicka et al., 2002Sitnicka E. Bryder D. Theilgaard-Mönch K. Buza-Vidas N. Adolfsson J.

Hardin J.D. Moore K.A. Boast S. Goff S.P. Lemischka I.R.

Stocking K.L. Miller R.E. Brasel K. De Smedt T. Maraskovsky E. Maliszewski C.R. Lynch D.H. Smith J. Pulendran B. et al.Mice lacking flt3 ligand have deficient hematopoiesis affecting hematopoietic progenitor cells, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells.Blood. 2000; 95: 3489-3497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, knockout studies fail to take into account the effects of overlapping or compensatory pathways, and few studies to date have addressed the effects of constitutive FLT3 activity on normal hematopoiesis or stem cell function. In order to determine whether the FLT3-ITD mutation affects HSC function, our lab has generated a heterozygous FLT3-ITD knockin mouse model that has an 18 bp insertion in the juxtamembrane domain of murine FLT3 (Li et al., 2008Li L. Piloto O. Nguyen H.B. Greenberg K. Takamiya K. Racke F. Huso D. Small D. Knock-in of an internal tandem duplication mutation into murine FLT3 confers myeloproliferative disease in a mouse model.Blood. 2008; 111: 3849-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). These mice express the germline ITD mutation under control of the endogenous murine FLT3 promoter and develop a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by splenomegaly, leukocytosis, and myeloid hypercellularity with a median survival of 10 months. Here, we describe isolation of an MPN-initiating stem cell within the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) compartment (Lin−CD48−CD150+) (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar) of FLT3-ITD knockin marrow that is capable of full engraftment and complete recapitulation of the MPN phenotype. Furthermore, we demonstrate that FLT3 transcripts and FLT3 protein are detectable in the SLAM-defined LT-HSC compartment and constitutive activation significantly perturbs HSC quiescence/homeostasis. We find that FLT3-ITD expression under the endogenous promoter results in changes in gene expression within the LT-HSC compartment including molecules involved in increased proliferation and activation of canonical FLT3 signaling pathways. Moreover, we demonstrate in vivo restoration of normal HSC function and simultaneous ablation of the MPN by treatment of mice with the FLT3 small molecule inhibitor Sorafenib. These data suggest a previously unrecognized role of FLT3 in LT-HSC homeostasis and demonstrate an intrinsic link between normal stem cell quiescence/homeostasis and MPN development as well as provide novel insights into the occurrence of FLT3 mutations in leukemogenesis. Bone marrow was harvested from mice heterozygous for the FLT3-ITD mutation under the control of its endogenous promoter. When stained for cell surface marker expression, FLT3-ITD bone marrow consistently displayed a 2- to10-fold expansion in the total number of lineage− progenitor cells as compared to wild-type (WT) littermate controls (Figures 1A, 1B, and 1F ). Within this expanded compartment, FLT3-ITD marrow showed increased numbers of cells expressing both c-kit and Sca-1, resulting in an approximaetly 4- to 8-fold increase in total number of KSLs—a population enriched for multipotent HSCs (Figures 1C and 1D) (Spangrude et al., 1988Spangrude G.J. Heimfeld S. Weissman I.L. Purification and characterization of mouse hematopoietic stem cells.Science. 1988; 241: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar; Okada et al., 1992Okada S. Nakauchi H. Nagayoshi K. Nishikawa S. Miura Y. Suda T. In vivo and in vitro stem cell function of c-kit- and Sca-1-positive murine hematopoietic cells.Blood. 1992; 80: 3044-3050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Katayama et al., 1993Katayama N. Shih J.P. Nishikawa S. Kina T. Clark S.C. Ogawa M. Stage-specific expression of c-kit protein by murine hematopoietic progenitors.Blood. 1993; 82: 2353-2360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon further breakdown of the KSL compartment by FLT3 and CD34 expression, FLT3-ITD mice appeared to have an increase in the frequency of MPPs as well as an uncharacterized population of cells expressing Lin− Kit+Sca-1+ FLT3+CD34− not observed at a significant frequency in WT littermates (Figure 1E). An alternative method for phenotypic identification of HSCs eliminates FLT3 as a necessary surface marker by utilizing SLAM marker expression to identify these rare cells. SLAM-defined HSCs (Lin− CD48−CD150+) have previously been described as highly enriched for long-term engraftment capacity (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). Strikingly, FLT3-ITD mice consistently displayed a 2- to 5-fold decrease in this SLAM population despite increases observed in total bone marrow cellularity (Figures 1F–1H). This decrease was even greater for the KSL-SLAM compartment (Figures 1I and 1J), which is believed to be even further enriched for LT-HSCs (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). This observed progenitor expansion with concomitant decrease in phenotypic LT-HSCs suggests that the expression of FLT3-ITD might perturb normal HSC homeostasis. Another method for HSC identification is the frequency of side population (SP) cells as determined by MDR1-mediated Hoechst dye efflux, commonly associated with functional HSC activity (Goodell et al., 2005Goodell M.A. McKinney-Freeman S. Camargo F.D. Isolation and characterization of side population cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 290: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar). Again FLT3-ITD bone marrow displayed a consistent 5-fold reduction in number of SP-defined HSCs (Figures 2A and 2B ). When they were examined for overlap with cell surface marker phenotype, we observed that a significantly smaller proportion of FLT3-ITD KSL cells were SP cells, as compared to results in WT littermate controls (Figure 2C), suggesting that fewer FLT3-ITD KSLs were functional stem cells. To investigate the functional effects of the FLT3-ITD mutation on HSCs, we transplanted several cell surface marker-defined hematopoietic populations. Unfractionated, lineage-depleted, and KSL bone marrow populations from FLT3-ITD mice demonstrated decreased engraftment capacity in comparison to WT marrow (Figure 2D). The presence of the ITD mutation did not confer any abnormal long-term engraftment capacity to any progenitor population examined, including CMPs, GMPs, MPPs, ST-HSCs, or the uncharacterized KSL FLT3+CD34− compartment (Table S1 available online). To explore the possibility that FLT3-ITD expression was affecting engraftment primarily by altering the homing ability of HSCs, intrafemoral injections were performed to bypass the need for HSCs to traffic to the bone marrow. As seen with intravenous injection, intrafemorally injected FLT3-ITD Lin− cells resulted in significantly reduced engraftment levels when compared to WT controls (Figure S1 available online). These data suggest that homing to the bone marrow is not the primary mechanism behind FLT3-ITD engraftment defects. As SLAM-defined HSCs have been previously shown to be highly enriched for cells with high long-term engraftment capacity (Kiel et al., 2005Kiel M.J. Yilmaz O.H. Iwashita T. Yilmaz O.H. Terhorst C. Morrison S.J. SLAM family receptors distinguish hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and reveal endothelial niches for stem cells.Cell. 2005; 121: 1109-1121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the observed engraftment defect may be due to the depletion of this SLAM population (Figures 1G and 1H). Once sorted by lineage and CD150 and CD48 expression, WT and FLT3-ITD SLAM cells demonstrated equivalent engraftment capacity, suggesting that in this model, SLAM cells best represent the functional HSC (Figure 3A). We next sought to determine whether FLT3-ITD SLAM cells were capable of recapitulating the MPN observed and previously reported in mice harboring the knockin mutation (Li et al., 2008Li L. Piloto O. Nguyen H.B. Greenberg K. Takamiya K. Racke F. Huso D. Small D. Knock-in of an internal tandem duplication mutation into murine FLT3 confers myeloproliferative disease in a mouse model.Blood. 2008; 111: 3849-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Transplant recipients of either FLT3-ITD or WT sorted SLAM cells were sacrificed 8 weeks posttransplant and examined for signs of disease. FLT3-ITD SLAM recipients exhibited both splenomegaly and myeloid expansion (Figures 3B and 3D). In addition, transplant recipients recapitulated the stem cell immunophenotypic abnormalities observed in primary FLT3-ITD knockin animals. FLT3-ITD SLAM recipients displayed a significant expansion in lineage− and myeloid progenitor cells, as observed in the donor mice (Figures 3C and 3D). Interestingly, despite receiving an equivalent number of donor SLAM cells, FLT3-ITD recipients demonstrated a 2- to 4-fold depletion of the SLAM compartment by 8 weeks posttransplant (Figure 3E). These data reveal that FLT3-ITD SLAM cells have the ability not only to engraft, but also to autonomously lead to the development of a MPN. In mice, the LT-HSC has been classically defined as having a Lin−Kit+Sca-1+ CD34−FLT3− immunophenotype (Christensen and Weissman, 2001Christensen J.L. Weissman I.L. Flk-2 is a marker in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation: a simple method to isolate long-term stem cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2001; 98: 14541-14546Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar; Osawa et al., 1996Osawa M. Hanada K.-i. Hamada H. Nakauchi H. Long-term lymphohematopoietic reconstitution by a single CD34low/negative hematopoietic stem cell.Science. 1996; 273: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1718) Google Scholar). Due to the observed defect in engraftment in the FLT3-ITD knockin mice and the correlated depletion of the SLAM compartment, we hypothesized that although FLT3 surface protein may not be abundant enough for detection by flow cytometry in LT-HSCs, low levels of expression may still play a role in stem cell homeostasis. To determine whether FLT3 was transcribed in the long-term engrafting and MPN-initiating stem cell, SLAM cells from both WT and FLT3-ITD mice were sorted and Flt3 transcript levels were quantified by qRT-PCR. Flt3 transcripts were detectable in both WT and FLT3-ITD SLAM cells, with an approximately 4-fold increase in Flt3 mRNA expression in the FLT3-ITD SLAM compartment (Figure 4A). As FLT3 protein is thought to be absent or undetectable on the cell surface of classically defined primitive LT-HSCs, we were interested in determining if the observed levels of Flt3 mRNA resulted in detectable FLT3 protein. When we measured the levels of total FLT3 protein (including intracellular) in the SLAM-defined HSC compartments of WT and FLT3-ITD mice, we were able to detect FLT3 protein in a fraction of both SLAM compartments (Figure 4B). We next sought to determine whether our observed FLT3-ITD phenotype in the LT-HSC was due to its direct expression within these primitive stem cells or if the effect was an indirect microenvironmental one (i.e., through cytokine/growth factor release from FLT3-ITD expressing cells in the bulk bone marrow or stromal environment). We transplanted recipient mice with a mixture of WT and FLT3-ITD Lin− bone marrow cells that resulted in approximately equal numbers of WT and FLT3-ITD SLAM cells. We could then examine the effects on both stem cell populations in a single environment (in the presence of both WT and FLT3-ITD marrow). At 10 weeks posttransplant, bone marrow from these mice was examined for the presence of WT (CD45.1) and FLT3-ITD (CD45.2) SLAM cells. Strikingly, only the FLT3-ITD SLAM cells were depleted, with the frequency of WT SLAM cells remaining at a normal level (Figure 4C). Within a single recipient, WT SLAM cells were present at frequencies ranging from 3- to 20-fold higher than FLT3-ITD SLAM cells (Table S2), suggesting that the observed SLAM depletion was a direct, cell autonomous effect. In an effort to determine the mechanism of FLT3-ITD-driven SLAM cell depletion, we hypothesized that the oncogenic mutation may drive these normally quiescent cells to proliferate. To further investigate, we measured HSC proliferation rates in WT and FLT3-ITD bone marrow through in vivo BrdU incorporation assays. Bone marrow was harvested 4 hr post BrdU injection and costained with cell surface markers to determine proliferation in multiple hematopoietic stem-progenitor"
https://openalex.org/W2157560413,"Transcription-coupled DNA repair uses components of the transcription machinery to identify DNA lesions and initiate their repair. These repair pathways are complex, so their mechanistic features remain poorly understood. Bacterial transcription-coupled repair is initiated when RNA polymerase stalled at a DNA lesion is removed by Mfd, an ATP-dependent DNA translocase. Here we use single-molecule DNA nanomanipulation to observe the dynamic interactions of Escherichia coli Mfd with RNA polymerase elongation complexes stalled by a cyclopyrimidine dimer or by nucleotide starvation. We show that Mfd acts by catalysing two irreversible, ATP-dependent transitions with different structural, kinetic and mechanistic features. Mfd remains bound to the DNA in a long-lived complex that could act as a marker for sites of DNA damage, directing assembly of subsequent DNA repair factors. These results provide a framework for considering the kinetics of transcription-coupled repair in vivo, and open the way to reconstruction of complete DNA repair pathways at single-molecule resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2074568405,"Secondary bacterial pneumonias are a frequent complication of influenza and other respiratory viral infections, but the mechanisms underlying viral-induced susceptibility to bacterial infections are poorly understood. In particular, it is unclear whether the host's response against the viral infection, independent of the injury caused by the virus, results in impairment of antibacterial host defense. Here, we sought to determine whether the induction of an ""antiviral"" immune state using various viral recognition receptor ligands was sufficient to result in decreased ability to combat common bacterial pathogens of the lung. Using a mouse model, animals were administered polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) or Toll-like 7 ligand (imiquimod or gardiquimod) intranasally, followed by intratracheal challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae. We found that animals pre-exposed to poly I:C displayed impaired bacterial clearance and increased mortality. Poly I:C-exposed animals also had decreased ability to clear methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, we showed that activation of Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 and Retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG-I)/Cardif pathways, which recognize viral nucleic acids in the form of dsRNA, both contribute to poly I:C mediated impairment of bacterial clearance. Finally, we determined that poly I:C administration resulted in significant induction of type I interferons (IFNs), whereas the elimination of type I IFN signaling improved clearance and survival following secondary bacterial pneumonia. Collectively, these results indicate that in the lung, poly I:C administration is sufficient to impair pulmonary host defense against clinically important gram-positive bacterial pathogens, which appears to be mediated by type I IFNs."
https://openalex.org/W2049946186,"Background Intestinal epithelium is essential for maintaining normal intestinal homeostasis; its breakdown leads to chronic inflammatory pathologies, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). Although high concentrations of S100A9 protein and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are found in patients with IBD, the expression mechanism of S100A9 in colonic epithelial cells (CECs) remains elusive. We investigated the role of IL-6 in S100A9 expression in CECs using a colitis model. Methods IL-6 and S100A9 expression, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation, and infiltration of immune cells were analyzed in mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The effects of soluble gp130-Fc protein (sgp130Fc) and S100A9 small interfering (si) RNA (si-S100A9) on DSS-induced colitis were evaluated. The molecular mechanism of S100A9 expression was investigated in an IL-6-treated Caco-2 cell line using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Results IL-6 concentrations increased significantly in the colon tissues of DSS-treated mice. sgp130Fc or si-S100A9 administration to DSS-treated mice reduced granulocyte infiltration in CECs and induced the down-regulation of S100A9 and colitis disease activity. Treatment with STAT3 inhibitors upon IL-6 stimulation in the Caco-2 cell line demonstrated that IL-6 mediated S100A9 expression through STAT3 activation. Moreover, we found that phospho-STAT3 binds directly to the S100A9 promoter. S100A9 may recruit immune cells into inflamed colon tissues. Conclusions Elevated S100A9 expression in CECs mediated by an IL-6/STAT3 signaling cascade may play an important role in the development of colitis."
https://openalex.org/W2106548780,"Human plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) transports cholesteryl ester from the antiatherogenic high-density lipoproteins (HDL) to the proatherogenic low-density and very low-density lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL). Inhibition of CETP has been shown to raise human plasma HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and is potentially a novel approach for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Here, we report the crystal structures of CETP in complex with torcetrapib, a CETP inhibitor that has been tested in phase 3 clinical trials, and compound 2, an analog from a structurally distinct inhibitor series. In both crystal structures, the inhibitors are buried deeply within the protein, shifting the bound cholesteryl ester in the N-terminal pocket of the long hydrophobic tunnel and displacing the phospholipid from that pocket. The lipids in the C-terminal pocket of the hydrophobic tunnel remain unchanged. The inhibitors are positioned near the narrowing neck of the hydrophobic tunnel of CETP and thus block the connection between the N- and C-terminal pockets. These structures illuminate the unusual inhibition mechanism of these compounds and support the tunnel mechanism for neutral lipid transfer by CETP. These highly lipophilic inhibitors bind mainly through extensive hydrophobic interactions with the protein and the shifted cholesteryl ester molecule. However, polar residues, such as Ser-230 and His-232, are also found in the inhibitor binding site.

Anacetrapib (3) contains the triad of trifluoromethyl groups found in torcetrapib but also has a distinct biaryl moiety (Fig. 1). Evacetrapib (4) contains a homologated core of torcetrapib and the 3,5-bis-trifluoromethylbenzyl group but also a methyl tetrazole and cyclohexane carboxylic acid side chain. Dalcetrapib (5) is more distinct from the fluorine-containing structures above, with an ortho-thio-anilide core (Fig. 1) and only modest CETP inhibitory activity in the human plasma assay (IC50, 9 μm), although it relies on forming a covalent disulfide linkage with CETP rather than reversible binding as in the above compounds. In a phase III clinical trial, torcetrapib demonstrated an increase of 72.1% in HDL-C and a decrease of 24.9% in LDL-C (18Barter P.J. Caulfield M. Eriksson M. Grundy S.M. Kastelein J.J. Komajda M.

The crystals were then cooled directly in liquid nitrogen before data collection. Crystallographic data sets were collected at the 17-ID beamline of the Advanced Photon Source at the Argonne National Laboratory (Chicago, IL). Diffraction data were processed with the program suite HKL-2000 (32Otwinowski Z. Borek D. Majewski W. Minor W. Multiparametric scaling of diffraction intensities.Acta Crystallogr.

The inhibitor-bound structures have been refined satisfactorily. The diffraction data collection and final refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. Probably due to prolonged soaking that was necessary to observe inhibitors, all crystals suffered from loss of resolution and anisotropic diffractions.

We identified and compared the function of a number of TRPM3 splice variants present in mouse, rat and human tissues. We found that variants lacking a region of 18 amino acid residues display neither Ca2+ entry nor ionic currents when expressed alone. Hence, splicing removes a region that is indispensable for channel function, which is called the ICF region. TRPM3 variants devoid of this region (TRPM3ΔICF), are ubiquitously present in different tissues and cell types where their transcripts constitute up to 15% of the TRPM3 isoforms. The ICF region is conserved throughout the TRPM family, and its presence in TRPM8 proteins is also necessary for function. Within the ICF region, 10 amino acid residues form a domain essential for the formation of operative TRPM3 channels. TRPM3ΔICF variants showed reduced interaction with other TRPM3 isoforms, and their occurrence at the cell membrane was diminished. Correspondingly, coexpression of ΔICF proteins with functional TRPM3 subunits not only reduced the number of channels but also impaired TRPM3-mediated Ca2+ entry.

The α(D)-globin gene originated via tandem duplication of an embryonic α-like globin gene in the stem lineage of tetrapod vertebrates, which suggests the possibility that functional differentiation between the HbA and HbD isoforms may be attributable to a retained ancestral character state in HbD that harkens back to a primordial, embryonic function. To investigate this possibility, we conducted a combined analysis of protein biochemistry and sequence evolution to characterize the structural and functional basis of Hb isoform differentiation in birds. Functional experiments involving purified HbA and HbD isoforms from 11 different bird species revealed that HbD is characterized by a consistently higher O(2) affinity in the presence of allosteric effectors such as organic phosphates and Cl(-) ions. In the case of both HbA and HbD, analyses of oxygenation properties under the two-state Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model revealed that the pH dependence of Hb-O(2) affinity stems primarily from changes in the O(2) association constant of deoxy (T-state)-Hb. Ancestral sequence reconstructions revealed that the amino acid substitutions that distinguish the adult-expressed Hb isoforms are not attributable to the retention of an ancestral (pre-duplication) character state in the α(D)-globin gene that is shared with the embryonic α-like globin gene."

In contrast, the placenta is a potential source of readily-obtainable stem cells throughout pregnancy. In fetal tissues, early gestational stem cells are known to have advantageous characteristics over neonatal and adult stem cells. Accordingly, we investigated whether early fetal placental chorionic stem cells (e-CSC) were physiologically superior to their late gestation fetal chorionic counterparts (l-CSC). We showed that e-CSC shared a common phenotype with l-CSC, differentiating down the osteogenic, adipogenic and neurogenic pathways, and containing a subset of cells endogenously expressing NANOG, SOX2, c-MYC, and KLF4, as well as an array of genes expressed in pluripotent stem cells and primordial germ cells, including CD24, NANOG, SSEA4, SSEA3, TRA-1-60, TRA-1-81, STELLA, FRAGILIS, NANOS3, DAZL and SSEA1. However, we showed that e-CSC have characteristics of an earlier state of stemness compared to l-CSC, such as smaller size, faster kinetics, uniquely expressing OCT4A variant 1 and showing higher levels of expression of NANOG, SOX2, c-MYC and KLF4 than l-CSC. Furthermore e-CSC, but not l-CSC, formed embryoid bodies containing cells from the three germ layer lineages. Finally, we showed that e-CSC demonstrate higher tissue repair in vivo; when transplanted in the osteogenesis imperfecta mice, e-CSC, but not l-CSC increased bone quality and plasticity; and when applied to a skin wound, e-CSC, but not l-CSC, accelerated healing compared to controls. Our results provide insight into the ontogeny of the stemness phenotype during fetal development and suggest that the more primitive characteristics of early compared to late gestation fetal chorionic stem cells may be translationally advantageous."
https://openalex.org/W2008987365,"Bone (or body) morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belong to the TGFβ superfamily and are crucial for embryonic patterning and organogenesis as well as for adult tissue homeostasis and repair. Activation of BMP receptors by their ligands leads to induction of several signaling cascades. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, FRET, and single particle tracking microscopy, we demonstrate that BMP receptor type I and II (BMPRI and BMPRII) have distinct lateral mobility properties within the plasma membrane, which is mandatory for their involvement in different signaling pathways. Before ligand binding, BMPRI and a subpopulation of BMPRII exhibit confined motion, reflecting preassembled heteromeric receptor complexes. A second free diffusing BMPRII population only becomes restricted after ligand addition. This paper visualizes time-resolved BMP receptor complex formation and demonstrates that the lateral mobility of BMPRI has a major impact in stabilizing heteromeric BMPRI-BMPRII receptor complexes to differentially stimulate SMAD versus non-SMAD signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1997457047,"We used gene expression profiling to identify inflammatory cytokines that correlate with bladder cancer development. Gene expression profiles of the tissue samples were investigated using cDNA microarrays that contained 103 non-muscle invasive bladder cancers (NMIBC), 62 muscle invasive bladder cancers (MIBC), 58 samples of histologically normal-looking surrounding tissues, and 10 normal, healthy subjects who served as the control cohort for comparison. We grouped the data-sets according to biological characterizations and focused on immune response genes with at least 2-fold differential expression in MIBC vs. controls. The experimental data-set identified 36 immune-related genes that were significantly altered in MIBC samples. In addition, 10 genes were up-regulated and 26 genes were down-regulated in MIBC samples compared with the normal tissues. Among the 10 up-regulated molecules examined, the capacity for both wound-healing migration and invasion was enhanced in response to IL-5, IL-20, and IL-28A in bladder cancer cell lines (253J and EJ cells), compared with untreated cells. The expression levels of IL-5, IL-20, and IL-28A were increased in patients with MIBC. All 3 cytokines and their receptors were produced in bladder cancer cell lines, as determined by real-time PCR, immunoblot analysis and confocal immunofluorescence. Up-regulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was found after IL-5, IL-20, and IL-28A stimulation in both cell types. Moreover, an EMSA assay showed that treatment with IL-5, IL-20, and IL-28A induced activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 that regulate the MMP-9 promoter. Finally, activation of MAPK and Jak-Stat signaling was observed after the addition of IL-5, IL-20, and IL-28A to bladder cancer cells. This study suggests the presence of specific inflammatory cytokine (IL-5, IL-20, and IL-28A)-mediated association in bladder cancer development. All 3 cytokines may be important new molecular targets for the modulation of migration and invasion in bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2027898593,"Dentate mossy cells in hippocampal slice can temporarily store stimulus information from the perforant path with persistent up-state–like activity. Here, Hyde and Strowbridge show that hippocampal dentate hilar cells can store several distinct patterns of information simultaneously for several seconds and that the activity of the local network in the dentate gyrus can predict which input conveyed the stimulus information and what temporal sequence of stimuli was presented. A primary function of the brain is the storage and retrieval of information. Except for working memory, where extracellular recordings have shown persistent discharges during delay-response tasks, it has been difficult to link memories with changes in individual neurons or specific synaptic connections. We found that transient stimuli are reliably encoded in the ongoing activity of brain tissue in vitro. Patterns of synaptic input onto dentate hilar neurons predicted which of four pathways were stimulated with an accuracy of 76% and performed significantly better than chance for >15 s. Dentate gyrus neurons were also able to accurately encode temporal sequences using population representations that were robust to variation in sequence interval. These results demonstrate direct neural encoding of temporal sequences in the spontaneous activity of brain tissue and suggest a local circuit mechanism that may contribute to diverse forms of short-term memory."
https://openalex.org/W2009692852,"Objective Carnitine homeostasis is disrupted in lambs with endothelial dysfunction secondary to increased pulmonary blood flow (Shunt). Our recent studies have also indicated that the disruption in carnitine homeostasis correlates with a decrease in PPAR-γ expression in Shunt lambs. Thus, this study was carried out to determine if there is a causal link between loss of PPAR-γ signaling and carnitine dysfunction, and whether the PPAR-γ agonist, rosiglitazone preserves carnitine homeostasis in Shunt lambs. Methods and Results siRNA-mediated PPAR-γ knockdown significantly reduced carnitine palmitoyltransferases 1 and 2 (CPT1 and 2) and carnitine acetyltransferase (CrAT) protein levels. This decrease in carnitine regulatory proteins resulted in a disruption in carnitine homeostasis and induced mitochondrial dysfunction, as determined by a reduction in cellular ATP levels. In turn, the decrease in cellular ATP attenuated NO signaling through a reduction in eNOS/Hsp90 interactions and enhanced eNOS uncoupling. In vivo, rosiglitazone treatment preserved carnitine homeostasis and attenuated the development of mitochondrial dysfunction in Shunt lambs maintaining ATP levels. This in turn preserved eNOS/Hsp90 interactions and NO signaling. Conclusion Our study indicates that PPAR-γ signaling plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial function through the regulation of carnitine homeostasis both in vitro and in vivo. Further, it identifies a new mechanism by which PPAR-γ regulates NO signaling through Hsp90. Thus, PPAR-γ agonists may have therapeutic potential in preventing the endothelial dysfunction in children with increased pulmonary blood flow."
https://openalex.org/W1990263700,"Changes in meat quality traits are strongly associated with alterations in postmortem metabolism which depend on genetic variations, especially nonsynonymous single nucleotide variations (nsSNVs) having critical effects on protein structure and function. To selectively identify metabolism-related nsSNVs, next-generation transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) was carried out using RNAs from porcine liver, which contains a diverse range of metabolic enzymes. The multiplex SNV genotyping analysis showed that various metabolism-related genes had different nsSNV alleles. Moreover, many nsSNVs were significantly associated with multiple meat quality traits. Particularly, ch7:g.22112616A>G SNV was identified to create a single amino acid change (Thr/Ala) at the 145th residue of H1.3-like protein, very close to the putative 147th threonine phosphorylation site, suggesting that the nsSNV may affect multiple meat quality traits by affecting the epigenetic regulation of postmortem metabolism-related gene expression. Besides, one nonsynonymous variation, probably generated by gene duplication, led to a stop signal in porcine testicular carbonyl reductase (PTCR), resulting in a C-terminal (E281-A288) deletion. Molecular docking and energy minimization calculations indicated that the binding affinity of wild-type PTCR to 5α-DHT, a C21-steroid, was superior to that of C-terminal-deleted PTCR or human carbonyl reductase, which was very consistent with experimental data, reported previously. Furthermore, P284 was identified as an important residue mediating the specific interaction between PTCR and 5α-DHT, and phylogenetic analysis showed that P284 is an evolutionarily conserved residue among animal carbonyl reductases, which suggests that the C-terminal tails of these reductases may have evolved under evolutionary pressure to increase the substrate specificity for C21-steroids and facilitate metabolic adaptation. Altogether, our RNA-Seq revealed that selective nsSNVs were associated with meat quality traits that could be useful for successful marker-assisted selection in pigs and also represents a useful resource to enhance understanding of protein folding, substrate specificity, and the evolution of enzymes such as carbonyl reductase."
https://openalex.org/W2169306264,"Eukaryotic organelles have developed elaborate protein quality control systems to ensure their normal activity, among which Deg/HtrA proteases play an essential role. Plant Deg2 protease is a homologue of prokaryotic DegQ/DegP proteases and is located in the chloroplast stroma, where its proteolytic activity is required to maintain the efficiency of photosynthetic machinery during stress. Here, we demonstrate that Deg2 exhibits dual protease-chaperone activities, and we present the hexameric structure of Deg2 complexed with co-purified peptides. The structure shows that Deg2 contains a unique second PDZ domain (PDZ2) following a conventional PDZ domain (PDZ1), with PDZ2 orchestrating the cage assembly of Deg2. We discovered a conserved internal ligand for PDZ2 that mediates hexamer formation and thus locks the protease in the resting state. These findings provide insight into the diverse modes of PDZ domain-mediated regulation of Deg proteases."

Oncogene-induced senescence is part of the tumorigenesis barrier imposed by DNA damage checkpoints.Nature. 2006; 444: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Analogously, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) can escape senescence and exhibit immortality through accumulation of DNA replication stress-associated lesions under continuous growth acceleration, which accompanies genomic instability (8Ichijima Y. Yoshioka K. Yoshioka Y. Shinohe K. Fujimori H. Unno J. Takagi M. Goto H. Inagaki M. Mizutani S. Teraoka H. DNA lesions induced by replication stress trigger mitotic aberration and tetraploidy development.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e8821Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and Arf/p53 mutations (9Matheu A. Maraver A. Klatt P. Flores I. Garcia-Cao I. Borras C. Flores J.M. Viña J. Blasco M.A. Serrano M. Delayed ageing through damage protection by the Arf/p53 pathway.Nature. 2007; 448: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, unlike CSCs, immortalized MEFs show neither tumorigenicity nor stemness characteristics (10Sun H. Taneja R. Analysis of transformation and tumorigenicity using mouse embryonic fibroblast cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 383: 303-310PubMed Google Scholar). The difference between immortal MEFs and CSCs underlies the properties of stemness characteristics. In addition to the expression of undifferentiated marker genes, both somatic stem cells and CSCs show sphere-formation abilities and heightened expression of the ATP binding cassette transporter and glycolysis dependence (11Yang Y.M. Chang J.W. Current status and issues in cancer stem cell study.Cancer Invest. 2008; 26: 741-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Kim J.H. Kim S.H. Hahn E.W.

Importantly, whereas these properties are widely observed in stem cells, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (13Bunting K.D.

Glycolytic enzymes can modulate cellular life span.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), immortal MEFs do not acquire such properties during immortalization. Unlike immortal MEFs, CSCs share specific profiles of cell-surface antigens with somatic stem cells (11Yang Y.M. Chang J.W. Current status and issues in cancer stem cell study.Cancer Invest. 2008; 26: 741-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, like immortal MEFs, CSCs also show genomic instability and mutations, which are unshared characteristics with normal stem cells (17Dontu G. El-Ashry D. Wicha M.S. Breast cancer, stem/progenitor cells, and the estrogen receptor.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2004; 15: 193-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The existing body of literature on stem cells suggests that carcinogenesis can be initiated in somatic stem cells when the cells are subjected to the same conditions of stress that induce MEF immortalization. However, this challenges the idea of stem cell homeostasis, which is strongly protected by niche environments from the induction of genomic instability and transformation (18Jones D.L. Wagers A.J. No place like home. Anatomy and function of the stem cell niche.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In agreement with this argument, stem cells injected into heterotropic sites are strongly implicated in tumorigenesis, in association with environmental aberrancies for stem cell maintenance (19Knoepfler P.S. Deconstructing stem cell tumorigenicity. A roadmap to safe regenerative medicine.Stem Cells. 2009; 27: 1050-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Further supporting the notion of stem cell tumorigenicity in aberrant environments, embryonal carcinomas were developed from xenografts of inner cell masses from mouse blastocyst and derailed primordial germ cells from the migration track (20Morange M. What history tells us VII. Twenty-five years ago. The production of mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Biosci. 2006; 31: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 21Wylie C. Germ cells.Cell. 1999; 96: 165-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study suggested that oncogenesis could be triggered by a niche disruption, resulting in disordered differentiation (22Raaijmakers M.H. Mukherjee S. Guo S. Zhang S. Kobayashi T. Schoonmaker J.A. Ebert B.L. Al-Shahrour F. Hasserjian R.P. Scadden E.O. Aung Z. Matza M. Merkenschlager M. Lin C. Rommens J.M. Scadden D.T. Bone progenitor dysfunction induces myelodysplasia and secondary leukemia.Nature. 2010; 464: 852-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Taken together with a report showing stem cell niche dysfunction as a result of aging (23Smith J.A. Daniel R. Stem cells and aging: a chicken-or-the-egg issue?.Aging Dis. 2012; 3: 260-268PubMed Google Scholar), these studies motivated the hypothesis that differentiating stem cells can become CSCs upon exposure to carcinogenic stress in a process analogous to MEF immortalization. Culture of mouse ESCs and embryoid body (EB) formation assays were performed as previously described (24Fujimori H. Asahina K. Shimizu-Saito K. Ikeda R. Tanaka Y. Teramoto K. Morita I. Teraoka H.

Hepatol. 2008; 48: 962-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For differentiation, cloned ESCs maintained with KnockOut Serum Replacement (Invitrogen) and ESGRO (mouse leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF); Millipore, Billerica, MA) were cultured in three kinds of medium consisting of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with FBS (Invitrogen), newborn bovine serum (NBS; Sigma), or adult bovine serum (ABS; Invitrogen) at 20%. The piled-up spheres were stained by crystal violet (Sigma), and the number of spheres was counted. Populations at P6 + 14 days were harvested by employing 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and then cultured in each medium for further experiments. All the following experiments were performed using bulk populations without cloning. Primary MEF immortalization assays were performed as previously described (8Ichijima Y. Yoshioka K. Yoshioka Y. Shinohe K. Fujimori H. Unno J. Takagi M. Goto H. Inagaki M. Mizutani S. Teraoka H. DNA lesions induced by replication stress trigger mitotic aberration and tetraploidy development.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e8821Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For detection of the phenotype with an abnormal p53 pathway, each population was cultured in medium containing hydroxyurea (HU) as previously described (25Marusyk A. Wheeler L.J. Mathews C.K. DeGregori J. p53 mediates senescence-like arrest induced by chronic replication stress.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5336-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Sphere formation assay was performed as previously described (26Fernandes K.J. McKenzie I.A. Mill P. Smith K.M. Akhavan M. Barnabé-Heider F. Biernaskie J. Junek A. Kobayashi N.R. Toma J.G. Kaplan D.R. Labosky P.A. Rafuse V. Hui C.C. Miller F.D. A dermal niche for multipotent adult skin-derived precursor cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1082-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) with a little modification. Briefly, CD133-positive and -negative populations were seeded to NBS-med containing methylcellulose 4000 (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) for 4 days. For detection, spheres were attached to culture dishes and were stained by crystal violet after 2 days of attachment (Sigma). β-Galactosidase activity was detected as previously described (27Lee B.Y. Han J.A. Im J.S. Morrone A. Johung K. Goodwin E.C. Kleijer W.J. DiMaio D. Hwang E.S. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase is lysosomal β-galactosidase.Aging Cell. 2006; 5: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultured cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and then incubated in staining buffer (1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe (CN)6, and 2 mm MgCl2 in PBS). RT-PCR and quantified RT-PCR were performed as described (24Fujimori H. Asahina K. Shimizu-Saito K. Ikeda R. Tanaka Y. Teramoto K. Morita I. Teraoka H.

Hepatol. 2008; 48: 962-973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cultured cells with an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) and treated with DNase I (Promega, Tokyo, Japan). cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Super Script III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Ampli Taq Gold PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen) or Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen) was employed for PCR reaction. The primer list is described in supplemental Table 1. The antibodies used are listed in supplemental Table 2. Immunostaining and Western blot analysis were performed as previously described (8Ichijima Y. Yoshioka K. Yoshioka Y. Shinohe K. Fujimori H. Unno J. Takagi M. Goto H. Inagaki M. Mizutani S. Teraoka H. DNA lesions induced by replication stress trigger mitotic aberration and tetraploidy development.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e8821Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, for Western blotting, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with appropriate primary antibodies. The membrane was incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and the antigen-antibody complex was visualized by Immobilon Western (Millipore). For immunostaining, cells were fixed with formalin and then treated with Triton X-100. After blocking with serum, they were incubated with each primary antibody and then detected with fluorescent secondary antibodies. Giemsa staining and flow cytometric analysis were performed as previously described (8Ichijima Y. Yoshioka K. Yoshioka Y. Shinohe K. Fujimori H. Unno J. Takagi M. Goto H. Inagaki M. Mizutani S. Teraoka H. DNA lesions induced by replication stress trigger mitotic aberration and tetraploidy development.PLoS One. 2010; 5: e8821Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitotic cells prepared by nocodazole treatment were hypotonically swollen with 75 mm KCl and then fixed with Carnoy's solution (75% methanol, 25% acetic acid). They were stained with 4% Giemsa (Merck) solution. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) was performed with the in situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan). The TUNEL-positive cells were detected by FACSCalibur HG (BD Biosciences). The sub-G1 population was quantified as previously described (28Masaki H. Nishida T. Kitajima S. Asahina K. Teraoka H.

Chem. 2007; 282: 33034-33042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The p53 transcripts from each population were amplified from the cDNA from each population and cloned using the pGEM-Easy vector system (Promega), and then the clones were sequenced by an ABI PRISM 3700 DNA analyzer (Invitrogen). For the tumor formation assay, 106 cells suspended in 100 μl of serum-free medium were mixed with an equal-volume of growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected subcutaneously into NOD.CB17-Prkdcscid/J (NOD-SCID) mice. Tumor weight was measured 4 weeks after injection. Tumors were dissolved by dispase (Invitrogen) in part, and total RNA was extracted. CD133 positive fractions of induced immortal-like cells (iICs) in NBS-med were isolated by a magnetic bead cell sorting or fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) technique as previously described (24Fujimori H.

Purification of fetal mouse hepatoblasts by magnetic beads coated with monoclonal anti-e-cadherin antibodies and their in vitro culture.Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 279: 330-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, for magnetic bead cell sorting, Dynabeads (Invitrogen) were coated with CD133 antibody (eBioscience). The beads/antibody complexes were incubated with cells, then the CD133-positive fraction was collected by a magnetic particle concentrator (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted from CD133-positive and -negative populations and subjected to RT-PCR. For FACS, cells incubated with CD133 antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 were sorted by FACS Aria II system (BD Biosciences). CD133-positive and negative fractions were subjected to sphere formation assay. Details of employed antibodies are described in supplemental Table 2. The differentiating cells 1 day after passage 3 in ABS medium were treated with 25, 75, or 200 ng/ml neocarzinostatin (NCS). After 1 day, cells were passaged with NCS(+) medium. After 3 days, medium was changed to NCS(−) medium. This procedure is illustrated in Fig. 4E. For Akt or PARP inhibition, differentiating cells on P2 or P1 cells in NBS-med were subjected to 0.25 μm Akt inhibitor IV (Merck) for 4 days or 0.5 μm AZD2281 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX) for 6 days, respectively. These procedures are illustrated in Fig. 8A. Cell numbers and the ratio of live/dead cells were calculated by a TC10 automatic cell counter (Bio-Rad). All statistical analyses were performed using at least three independent measurements. All error bars represent S.D. (n − 1). Analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni multiple comparison test (see Figs. 1F and 6A) or t test with Welch correction (see Figs. 2G, 4D, 6C, 6Dc, 6F, 6G, and 7B and supplemental Figs. S4D and S5) was performed for assessment. p values <0.05 were considered to be significant. The green asterisks on Fig. 6C and 6Dc and supplemental Figs. S4D and S5 indicate significant differences in value between each sample and ESCs.FIGURE 6Carcinogenic stress is induced during differentiation of ESCs in aberrant environments. A, cell growth in each medium condition is shown. Unlike continuously growing ESCs in the KSR + LIF condition, differentiating cells under each condition were growth-arrested at P2-P3. B and C, massive apoptosis induction was observed at P2-P3 with the TUNEL assay (B) and sub-G1 fractions (C). ES, embryonic stem. Sub-G1 fraction analysis revealed that apoptosis is mainly induced at P2-P3, which coincides with growth suppression (A). D, the status of spontaneously accumulated DNA lesions was determined by γH2AX foci formation (Da, also demonstrated in supplemental Fig. S3C) as well as γH2AX signal detection with Western blotting (Db). γH2AX signals were diminished at P3 in the differentiating cells in FBS- and ABS-med but not significantly decreased in cells in NBS-med (see P2 and P3 and quantified Fig. 4Dc). E and F, additional DNA damage accelerates the piled-up sphere formation. Experimental design is shown in E. ESCs were maintained and differentiated in ABS-med as in Fig. 1A, but the P3 cells in P3 + 1 day were treated with NCS for 3 days. After NCS treatment, cells were maintained with medium change as cells rapidly senesced (F, 3 days after NCS treatment). NCS treatment allows differentiating ESCs to form spheres in ABS-med. Images are representative, showing senescent cells, and resulting sphere development was induced under ABS-med with 25 ng/ml NCS treatment (F). The frequency of piled-up sphere development in ABS-med was also determined with different NCS doses (F, graph). Different than the Fig. 1 results, we observed piled-up colony formation in non-NCS-treated conditions, implying that a decrease in the times of passage allowed remaining undifferentiated cell proliferation. Scale bars, 100 μm. G, the status of DNA lesions in M-phase cells was determined by co-localized staining of γH2AX and phosphorylated histone H3 (pH3) (arrows). Images are representative.

Lower panels show expanded images of the squares in the upper panels. Yellow arrows indicate the representative cells showing flattened and enlarged morphology. Scale bars, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To directly address whether differentiating stem cells in aberrant environments are subjected to stress for cellular transformation, the effects of changes in the differentiation culture conditions of ESCs were first assessed. Although ESC injection under a homotopic implantation into blastocysts shows normal embryogenesis, that under heterotopic transplantations leads to tumor development (teratomas or teratocarcinomas) (20Morange M. What history tells us VII. Twenty-five years ago. The production of mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Biosci. 2006; 31: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Based on this, we attempted to construct an in vitro model in which ESCs maintained with KSR/LIF medium were subjected to differentiation in the medium containing FBS-med, NBS-med, or ABS-med (Fig. 1A). Differentiating cells were passaged under unique ESC passage conditions to produce consistent cellular environments. As shown in Fig. 1B, ESCs differentiating under each condition initially grew but then stopped proliferation, showing altered morphologies while differentiating (Fig. 1B, P3 and P5 cells, arrows). Cells in NBS-med typically become senescent, as demonstrated by their flattened and enlarged morphology and senescence-associated β-galactosidase activation (Fig. 1C). Such senescent cells were first observed at P3 and became dominant in the culture at P5 (Fig. 1B, P3 and P5, arrows). Surprisingly, analogous to MEF immortalization, continuous cultivation in NBS-med led to the emergence of re-proliferating colonies in the previously senescent cells (Fig. 1, B (see panels NBS at P6 + 14 days) and D). Because these proliferating cells were able to continuously proliferate more than 40 passages in an immortal manner (data not shown), we named them “induced immortal-like cells” (iICs). Intriguingly, iICs appeared with piled-up sphere morphology in LIF-free medium containing NBS (Fig. 1D). Whereas cultivation in FBS-med conditions also, subsequently, led to a small subset of continuously growing cells (cGCs) without showing a canonical senescent stage, piled-up colonies were rarely observed in FBS-med and ABS-med (Fig. 1B; P6 + 14 days, E, and F), suggesting that piled-up sphere development through senescence is dependent on differentiation culture conditions. Similar to MEF immortalization (Fig. 1G), differentiating ESCs in NBS-med first senesced and then spontaneously developed re-proliferating cells. However, unlike immortalized MEFs, ESCs in NBS-med subsequently formed piled-up spheres that are characteristic of stem cells, suggesting that the induced colonies, in fact, are cancerous transformants possessing stemness characteristics. To determine whether the iICs, appearing in aggregates of sphere colonies, exhibited cancerous features, the cells were first assessed for genomic instability, which is a characteristic of cancer cells (30Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genetic instabilities in human cancers.Nature. 1998; 396: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). As expected, the iICs showed aneuploidy, most of which is a common type of genomic instability in cancer cells, at P6 + 14 days in Giemsa staining of spread chromosomes (Fig. 2A) and in DNA content analysis using flow cytometry (Fig. 2B). Thus, the development of genomic instability accompanies immortal sphere formation in ESC-derived differentiating cells in NBS-med in a process analogous to carcinogenesis. Because most cancer cells are mutated in either Arf or p53 in a mutually exclusive manner and lose the function of Arf-dependent p53 activation (31Sherr C.J. McCormick F. The RB and p53 pathways in cancer.Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 103-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), the mutation status of p53 in the iICs in NBS-"

https://openalex.org/W2033379255,"During blood coagulation, the protease factor XIa (fXIa) activates factor IX (fIX). We describe a new mechanism for this process. FIX is cleaved initially after Arg(145) to form fIXα, and then after Arg(180) to form the protease fIXaβ. FIXα is released from fXIa, and must rebind for cleavage after Arg(180) to occur. Catalytic efficiency of cleavage after Arg(180) is 7-fold greater than for cleavage after Arg(145), limiting fIXα accumulation. FXIa contains four apple domains (A1-A4) and a catalytic domain. Exosite(s) on fXIa are required for fIX binding, however, there is lack of consensus on their location(s), with sites on the A2, A3, and catalytic domains described. Replacing the A3 domain with the prekallikrein A3 domain increases K(m) for fIX cleavage after Arg(145) and Arg(180) 25- and ≥ 90-fold, respectively, and markedly decreases k(cat) for cleavage after Arg(180). Similar results were obtained with the isolated fXIa catalytic domain, or fXIa in the absence of Ca(2+). Forms of fXIa lacking the A3 domain exhibit 15-fold lower catalytic efficiency for cleavage after Arg(180) than for cleavage after Arg(145), resulting in fIXα accumulation. Replacing the A2 domain does not affect fIX activation. The results demonstrate that fXIa activates fIX by an exosite- and Ca(2+)-mediated release-rebind mechanism in which efficiency of the second cleavage is enhanced by conformational changes resulting from the first cleavage. Initial binding of fIX and fIXα requires an exosite on the fXIa A3 domain, but not the A2 or catalytic domain."
https://openalex.org/W2134816381,"Settlement ponds are used to treat aquaculture discharge water by removing nutrients through physical (settling) and biological (microbial transformation) processes. Nutrient removal through settling has been quantified, however, the occurrence of, and potential for microbial nitrogen (N) removal is largely unknown in these systems. Therefore, isotope tracer techniques were used to measure potential rates of denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) in the sediment of settlement ponds in tropical aquaculture systems. Dinitrogen gas (N(2)) was produced in all ponds, although potential rates were low (0-7.07 nmol N cm(-3) h(-1)) relative to other aquatic systems. Denitrification was the main driver of N(2) production, with anammox only detected in two of the four ponds. No correlations were detected between the measured sediment variables (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, iron, manganese, sulphur and phosphorous) and denitrification or anammox. Furthermore, denitrification was not carbon limited as the addition of particulate organic matter (paired t-Test; P = 0.350, n = 3) or methanol (paired t-Test; P = 0.744, n = 3) did not stimulate production of N(2). A simple mass balance model showed that only 2.5% of added fixed N was removed in the studied settlement ponds through the denitrification and anammox processes. It is recommended that settlement ponds be used in conjunction with additional technologies (i.e. constructed wetlands or biological reactors) to enhance N(2) production and N removal from aquaculture wastewater."
https://openalex.org/W2158263023,"The aim of this study was to identify a biomarker useful in the diagnosis and therapy of ovarian malignant germ cell tumor (OMGCT).The karyopherin 2 (KPNA2) expression in OMGCT and normal ovarian tissue was determined by standard gene microarray assays, and further validated by a quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. The correlation between KPNA2 expression in OMGCT and certain clinicopathological features were analyzed. Expression of SALL4, a stem cell marker, was also examined in comparison with KPNA2.KPNA2 was found to be over-expressed by approximately eight-fold in yolk sac tumors and immature teratomas compared to normal ovarian tissue by microarray assays. Overexpression was detected in yolk sac tumors, immature teratomas, dysgerminomas, embryonal carcinomas, mature teratomas with malignant transformation and mixed ovarian germ cell tumors at both the transcription and translation levels. A positive correlation between KPNA2 and SALL4 expression at both the transcription level (R = 0.5120, P = 0.0125), and the translation level (R = 0.6636, P<0.0001), was presented. Extensive expression of KPNA2 was positively associated with pathologic type, recurrence and uncontrolled, ascitic fluid presence, suboptimal cytoreductive surgery necessity, resistance/refraction to initial chemotherapy, HCG level and SALL4 level in OMGCT patients. KPNA2 was found to be an independent factor for 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of OMGCT (P = 0.02). The 5-year overall survival (OS) and DFS rate for KPNA2-low expression patients (88% and 79%, n = 48) were significantly higher than the OS and DFS rate for KPNA2-high expression patients (69% and 57.1%, n = 42)(P = 0.0151, P = 0.0109, respectively). The 5-year OS and DFS rate for SALL4-low expression patients (84% and 74%, n = 62) was marginally significantly higher than the high expression patients (78.6% and 71.4%, n = 28)(P = 0.0519, P = 0.0647, respectively).KPNA2 is a potential candidate molecular marker and important prognostic marker in OMGCT patients."
https://openalex.org/W1994490062,"Background Early access to tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment remains a challenge in developing countries. General use of informal providers such as storekeepers is common. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness and acceptability of a storekeeper-based referral system for TB suspects in urban settings of Lilongwe, Malawi. Methods The referral system intervention was implemented in two sub-districts. This was evaluated using a pre and post comparison as well as comparison with a third sub-district designated as the control. The intervention included training of storekeepers to detect and refer clients with chronic cough using predesigned referral letters along with monitoring and supervision. Data from a community based chronic cough survey and an audit of health centre records were used to measure its effectiveness. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were carried out to document acceptability of the intervention with the different stakeholders. Results Following the intervention, the mean patient delay appeared lower in the intervention than comparison areas (2.14 weeks (SD 5.8) vs 8.8 weeks (SD 15.1)). However, after adjusting for confounding variables this difference was not significant (p = 0.07). After the intervention the proportion of the population diagnosed with smear positive TB in the intervention sites (1.2 per 1000) was significantly higher than in the comparison area (0.6 per 1000, p<0.01) even after adjusting for sex and age. Qualitative findings suggested that (a) the referral letters triggered health workers to ask patients to submit sputum for TB diagnosis (b) the approach may be sustainable as the referral role was linked to the livelihood of the storekeepers. Conclusion The study suggests that the referral system with storekeepers is sustainable and effective in increasing smear positive TB case notification. Studies that assess this approach for control of other diseases along with collection of specimens by storekeepers or similar providers are needed."

We present novel data showing that the C-terminal 35 residues of the β1a subunit adopt a nascent α-helix in which 3 hydrophobic residues align to form a hydrophobic surface that binds to RyR1 isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle. Mutation of the hydrophobic residues (L496, L500, W503) in peptide β1aV490-M524, corresponding to the C-terminal 35 residues of β1a, reduced peptide binding to RyR1 to 15.2 ± 7.1% and prevented the 2.9 ± 0.2-fold activation of RyR1 by 10 nM wild-type peptide. An upstream hydrophobic heptad repeat implicated in β1a binding to RyR1 does not contribute to RyR1 activation. Wild-type β1aA474-A508 peptide (10 nM), containing heptad repeat and hydrophobic surface residues, increased RyR1 activity by 2.3 ± 0.2- and 2.2 ± 0.3-fold after mutation of the heptad repeat residues. We conclude that specific hydrophobic surface residues in the 35 residue β1a C-terminus bind to RyR1 and increase channel activity in lipid bilayers and thus may support skeletal EC coupling.—Karunasekara, Y., Rebbeck, R.

https://openalex.org/W2167698087,"Microbial anaerobic and so-called hybrid pathways for degradation of aromatic compounds contain β-oxidation-like steps. These reactions convert the product of the opening of the aromatic ring to common metabolites. The hybrid phenylacetate degradation pathway is encoded in Escherichia coli by the paa operon containing genes for 10 enzymes. Previously, we have analyzed protein-protein interactions among the enzymes catalyzing the initial oxidation steps in the paa pathway (Grishin, A. M., Ajamian, E., Tao, L., Zhang, L., Menard, R., and Cygler, M. (2011) J. Biol. Chem. 286, 10735-10743). Here we report characterization of interactions between the remaining enzymes of this pathway and show another stable complex, PaaFG, an enoyl-CoA hydratase and enoyl-Coa isomerase, both belonging to the crotonase superfamily. These steps are biochemically similar to the well studied fatty acid β-oxidation, which can be catalyzed by individual monofunctional enzymes, multifunctional enzymes comprising several domains, or enzymatic complexes such as the bacterial fatty acid β-oxidation complex. We have determined the structure of the PaaFG complex and determined that although individually PaaF and PaaG are similar to enzymes from the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, the structure of the complex is dissimilar from bacterial fatty acid β-oxidation complexes. The PaaFG complex has a four-layered structure composed of homotrimeric discs of PaaF and PaaG. The active sites of PaaF and PaaG are adapted to accept the intermediary components of the Paa pathway, different from those of the fatty acid β-oxidation. The association of PaaF and PaaG into a stable complex might serve to speed up the steps of the pathway following the conversion of phenylacetyl-CoA to a toxic and unstable epoxide-CoA by PaaABCE monooxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W2062348598,"A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), a member of the TNF ligand superfamily with an important role in humoral immunity, is also implicated in several cancers as a prosurvival factor. APRIL binds two different TNF receptors, B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and transmembrane activator and cylclophilin ligand interactor (TACI), and also interacts independently with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Because APRIL shares binding of the TNF receptors with B cell activation factor, separating the precise signaling pathways activated by either ligand in a given context has proven quite difficult. In this study, we have used the protein design algorithm FoldX to successfully generate a BCMA-specific variant of APRIL, APRIL-R206E, and two TACI-selective variants, D132F and D132Y. These APRIL variants show selective activity toward their receptors in several in vitro assays. Moreover, we have used these ligands to show that BCMA and TACI have a distinct role in APRIL-induced B cell stimulation. We conclude that these ligands are useful tools for studying APRIL biology in the context of individual receptor activation."
