https://openalex.org/W1968425270,"In the absence of an overt cytoskeleton, the external cell wall of bacteria has traditionally been assumed to be the primary determinant of cell shape. In the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, two related genes, mreB and mbl, were shown to be required for different aspects of cell morphogenesis. Subcellular localization of the MreB and Mbl proteins revealed that each forms a distinct kind of filamentous helical structure lying close to the cell surface. The distribution of the proteins in different species of bacteria, and the similarity of their sequence to eukaryotic actins, suggest that the MreB-like proteins have a cytoskeletal, actin-like role in bacterial cell morphogenesis."

Mouse oocytes and preimplantation embryos lack Dnmt1 but express a variant of this protein called Dnmt1o. We eliminated Dnmt1o by deletion of the oocyte-specific promoter and first exon from the Dnmt1 locus. Homozygous animals were normal, but most heterozygous fetuses of homozygous females died during the last third of gestation. Although genomic methylation patterns were established normally in Dnmt1o-deficient oocytes, embryos derived from such oocytes showed a loss of allele-specific expression and methylation at certain imprinted loci. Transient nuclear localization of Dnmt1o in 8-cell embryos suggests that this variant of Dnmt1 provides maintenance methyltransferase activity specifically at imprinted loci during the fourth embryonic S phase."
https://openalex.org/W2078638321,"Fgfs direct embryogenesis of several organs, including the lung, limb, and anterior pituitary. Here we report male-to-female sex reversal in mice lacking Fibroblast growth factor 9 (Fgf9), demonstrating a novel role for FGF signaling in testicular embryogenesis. Fgf9(-/-) mice also exhibit lung hypoplasia and die at birth. Reproductive system phenotypes range from testicular hypoplasia to complete sex reversal, with most Fgf9(-/-) XY reproductive systems appearing grossly female at birth. Fgf9 appears to act downstream of Sry to stimulate mesenchymal proliferation, mesonephric cell migration, and Sertoli cell differentiation in the embryonic testis. While Sry is found only in some mammals, Fgfs are highly conserved. Thus, Fgfs may function in sex determination and reproductive system development in many species."
https://openalex.org/W2024596477,"The pituitary gland has provided unique insight into molecular mechanisms and regulatory factors controlling both differentiation and gene transcription. We identified Tpit, a novel T box factor only present in the two pituitary POMC-expressing lineages, the corticotrophs and melanotrophs, and apparently in no other tissue, including hypothalamic POMC neurons. In pituitary cells, Tpit activation of POMC gene transcription requires cooperation with Pitx1, the two factors binding to contiguous sites within the same regulatory element. In gain-of-function experiments, Tpit induces POMC expression in undifferentiated pituitary cells, indicating that it can initiate differentiation into POMC-expressing lineages. TPIT gene mutations were found in patients with isolated deficiency of pituitary POMC-derived ACTH, in support of an essential role of Tpit for differentiation of the pituitary POMC lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1551404386,"Functional primordial proteins presumably originated from random sequences, but it is not known how frequently functional, or even folded, proteins occur in collections of random sequences. Here we have used in vitro selection of messenger RNA displayed proteins, in which each protein is covalently linked through its carboxy terminus to the 3' end of its encoding mRNA, to sample a large number of distinct random sequences. Starting from a library of 6 x 1012 proteins each containing 80 contiguous random amino acids, we selected functional proteins by enriching for those that bind to ATP. This selection yielded four new ATP-binding proteins that appear to be unrelated to each other or to anything found in the current databases of biological proteins. The frequency of occurrence of functional proteins in random-sequence libraries appears to be similar to that observed for equivalent RNA libraries."
https://openalex.org/W2009664225,"Cholera toxin is assembled from two subunits in the periplasm of Vibrio cholerae and disassembled in the analogous compartment of target cells, the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), before a fragment of it, the A1 chain, is transported into the cytosol. We show that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) in the ER lumen functions to disassemble and unfold the toxin once its A chain has been cleaved. PDI acts as a redox-driven chaperone; in the reduced state, it binds to the A chain and in the oxidized state it releases it. Our results explain the pathway of cholera toxin, suggest a role for PDI in retrograde protein transport into the cytosol, and indicate that PDI can act as a novel type of chaperone, whose binding and release of substrates is regulated by a redox, rather than an ATPase, cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2072509928,"CLIP-170 and CLIP-115 are cytoplasmic linker proteins that associate specifically with the ends of growing microtubules and may act as anti-catastrophe factors. Here, we have isolated two CLIP-associated proteins (CLASPs), which are homologous to the Drosophila Orbit/Mast microtubule-associated protein. CLASPs bind CLIPs and microtubules, colocalize with the CLIPs at microtubule distal ends, and have microtubule-stabilizing effects in transfected cells. After serum induction, CLASPs relocalize to distal segments of microtubules at the leading edge of motile fibroblasts. We provide evidence that this asymmetric CLASP distribution is mediated by PI3-kinase and GSK-3β. Antibody injections suggest that CLASP2 is required for the orientation of stabilized microtubules toward the leading edge. We propose that CLASPs are involved in the local regulation of microtubule dynamics in response to positional cues."
https://openalex.org/W2014479208,"The pattern of neuronal specification in the ventral neural tube is controlled by homeodomain transcription factors expressed by neural progenitor cells, but no general logic has emerged to explain how these proteins determine neuronal fate. We show that most of these homeodomain proteins possess a conserved eh1 motif that mediates the recruitment of Gro/TLE corepressors. The eh1 motif underlies the function of these proteins as repressors during neural patterning in vivo. Inhibition of Gro/TLE-mediated repression in vivo results in a deregulation of cell pattern in the neural tube. These results imply that the pattern of neurogenesis in the neural tube is achieved through the spatially controlled repression of transcriptional repressors-a derepression strategy of neuronal fate specification."
https://openalex.org/W2074920372,"Mutations in alpha-synuclein, a protein highly enriched in presynaptic terminals, have been implicated in the expression of familial forms of Parkinson's disease (PD) whereas native alpha-synuclein is a major component of intraneuronal inclusion bodies characteristic of PD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Although overexpression of human alpha-synuclein induces dopaminergic nerve terminal degeneration, the molecular mechanism by which alpha-synuclein contributes to the degeneration of these pathways remains enigmatic. We report here that alpha-synuclein complexes with the presynaptic human dopamine transporter (hDAT) in both neurons and cotransfected cells through the direct binding of the non-A beta amyloid component of alpha-synuclein to the carboxyl-terminal tail of the hDAT. alpha-Synuclein--hDAT complex formation facilitates the membrane clustering of the DAT, thereby accelerating cellular dopamine uptake and dopamine-induced cellular apoptosis. Since the selective vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in PD has been ascribed in part to oxidative stress as a result of the cellular overaccumulation of dopamine or dopamine-like molecules by the presynaptic DAT, these data provide mechanistic insight into the mode by which the activity of these two proteins may give rise to this process."
https://openalex.org/W2041803958,"To investigate the function of SWI/SNF in site-specific chromatin remodeling at promoters, we have used a purified system to analyze its distribution, function, and retention following recruitment by a sequence-specific transcription activator. Activator recruitment of SWI/SNF bound the complex to promoter proximal nucleosomes and led to localized nucleosome disruption. However, retention of SWI/SNF on the promoter required either the continued binding of the transcription activator or acetylated histones. Histone acetylation by either the SAGA or NuA4 HAT complexes increased the retention of SWI/SNF on the promoter. These data illustrate a functional link between HAT complexes and the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and provide a mechanistic basis for the ordered recruitment of these complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2151076343,"A regulatory loop between the fibroblast growth factors FGF-8 and FGF-10 plays a key role in limb initiation and AER induction in vertebrate embryos. Here, we show that three WNT factors signaling through β-catenin act as key regulators of the FGF-8/FGF-10 loop. The Wnt-2b gene is expressed in the intermediate mesoderm and the lateral plate mesoderm in the presumptive chick forelimb region. Cells expressing Wnt-2b are able to induce Fgf-10 and generate an extra limb when implanted into the flank. In the presumptive hindlimb region, another Wnt gene, Wnt-8c, controls Fgf-10 expression, and is also capable of inducing ectopic limb formation in the flank. Finally, we also show that the induction of Fgf-8 in the limb ectoderm by FGF-10 is mediated by the induction of Wnt-3a. Thus, three WNT signals mediated by β-catenin control both limb initiation and AER induction in the vertebrate embryo."

https://openalex.org/W2115956096,"Aquaporins (AQPs) are channel proteins that regulate the movement of water through the plasma membrane of secretory and absorptive cells in response to osmotic gradients. In the salivary gland, AQP5 is the major aquaporin expressed on the apical membrane of acinar cells. Previous studies have shown that the volume of saliva secreted by AQP5-deficient mice is decreased, indicating a role for AQP5 in saliva secretion; however, the mechanism by which AQP5 regulates water transport in salivary acinar cells remains to be determined. Here we show that the decreased salivary flow rate and increased tonicity of the saliva secreted byAqp5 −/− mice in response to pilocarpine stimulation are not caused by changes in whole body fluid homeostasis, indicated by similar blood gas and electrolyte concentrations in urine and blood in wild-type and AQP5-deficient mice. In contrast, the water permeability in parotid and sublingual acinar cells isolated from Aqp5 −/− mice is decreased significantly. Water permeability decreased by 65% in parotid and 77% in sublingual acinar cells fromAqp5 −/− mice in response to hypertonicity-induced cell shrinkage and hypotonicity-induced cell swelling. These data show that AQP5 is the major pathway for regulating the water permeability in acinar cells, a critical property of the plasma membrane which determines the flow rate and ionic composition of secreted saliva.

The fluid component of salivary secretions hydrates the oral cavity, aiding in the mastication and swallowing of food, in the neutralization of acids, and in protection against the invasion of potential pathogens. Clinically, salivary gland hypofunction commonly presents as xerostomia, a symptomatic complaint of dry mouth prevalent in the geriatric population (for review, see Ref. 1Bivona P.L. N. Y. State Dent. J. 1998; 64: 46-52PubMed Google Scholar) which may result from either systemic or extrinsic causes (for review, see Refs.1Bivona P.L. N. Y. State Dent. J. 1998; 64: 46-52PubMed Google Scholar, 2Astor F.C. Hanft K.L. Ciocon J.O. Ear Nose Throat J. 1999; 78: 476-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 3Fox P.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 842: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Saliva formation is a two-stage process (4Turner R.J. Paulais M. Manganel M. Lee S.I. Moran A. Melvin J.E. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 384-391Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5He X. Tse C.-M. Donowitz M. Alper S.L. Gabriel S.E. Baum B.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 433: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). First, the acinar cells secrete an isotonic plasma-like fluid, and second, ductal cells modify the acinar secretions primarily through the reabsorption of Na+ and Cl− so that the final saliva is hypotonic. This fluid secretion model predicts that saliva formation is primarily caused by transepithelial Cl−transport and that Cl− uptake is dependent on an inwardly directed Na+ chemical gradient across the basolateral plasma membrane. An increase in intracellular Ca2+, usually associated with muscarinic receptor stimulation, triggers fluid secretion by simultaneously activating apical Cl− channels and basolateral K+ channels. The efflux of Cl−and K+ across the apical and basolateral membranes, respectively, produces a transepithelial potential difference that is neutralized by paracellular Na+ transport across tight junctions. The resulting transepithelial osmotic gradient drives the movement of water, creating a plasma-like primary secretion. In salivary gland acinar cells, secretion is associated with cell volume changes (6Foskett J.K. Melvin J.E. Science. 1989; 244: 1582-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7Foskett J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C998-C1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The shrinkage and swelling of salivary gland acinar cells following muscarinic and β-adrenergic stimulation, respectively, are thought to occur as a result of an imbalance between the influx and efflux of ions (specifically Cl−) between the luminal and basolateral membranes (8Steward M.C. Seo Y. Murakami M. Seo J.T. Larcombe-McDouall J.B. Case R.M. Eur. J. Morphol. 1998; 36: 103-106PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting change in tonicity requires a rapid and regulated change in acinar cell water permeability which is necessary for secretion and maintenance of cell volume following stimulation. Aquaporin 5 (AQP5),1 a mercury-sensitive water channel, has been localized to the luminal surface of acinar cells in the salivary gland, the site of salivary secretion (9Matsuzaki T. Suzuki T. Koyama H. Tanaka S. Takata K. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Recently Ma et al. (10Ma T. Song Y. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20071-20074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) showed that AQP5-deficient mice secrete a low volume of viscous hypertonic saliva after supramaximal pilocarpine stimulation. They hypothesized that AQP5 plays a role in regulating membrane water permeability and that it is also required for maintaining proper osmolality of the secreted saliva, although a mechanism by which this is accomplished was not examined. The results of this study are consistent with at least two potential mechanisms whereby hyposalivation might be induced in mice lacking AQP5. The simplest explanation is that AQP5 acts as the apical water pathway during stimulated fluid secretion, although no basolateral channel has been identified as yet. Alternatively, targeted disruption of the Aqp5 gene may alter whole animal water balance, resulting in an increase in the osmolarity of the blood. Previous studies clearly show that dehydration increases the osmolarity of blood, and this in turn correlates with decreased salivation (11Fischer D. Ship J.A. Special Care Dent. 1997; 17: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,12Silanikove N. Tadmor A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: R809-815PubMed Google Scholar) Here we directly measure membrane water permeability of isolated acinar cells from Aqp5 +/+ andAqp5 −/− mice as well as flow rates and osmolality measurements of secreted saliva. Hyposalivation is not caused by changes in whole body fluid homeostasis, but instead, we demonstrate that the membrane permeability of salivary gland acinar cells is dramatically reduced in mice lacking AQP5. Our results are the first to provide a mechanism for AQP5 function during salivary secretion. Mouse genomic clones containing the Aqp5 locus were isolated from a 129SvJ DNA bacteriophage λ library by hybridization with an AQP5 partial cDNA clone and characterized as described (13Krane C.M. Towne J.E. Menon A.G. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Two fragments of the Aqp5 locus, an ∼1.8-kb KpnI fragment extending from within exon 1 through intron 2, and an ∼800-bp HindIII/BamHI fragment extending from intron 3 to within the 3′-untranslated region of exon 4, were inserted to flank the 3′- and 5′-ends of a PGK-neomycin resistance gene (14Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), respectively. A herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase expression cassette (pMC1-TK (14Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar)) was placed outside of the homologous segments, 5′ to the left arm, to provide selection against random insertion of the targeting vector. Isogenic ES cells derived from the 129SvJ mouse strain were electroporated with 50 μg of linearized targeting vector. After electroporation, the cells were subjected to selection with G418 and gancyclovir as described (15Askew G.R. Doetschman T. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4115-4124Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A 931-bp diagnostic probe 5′ to the homologous region represented in the targeting vector was used to screen 187 ES cell clones by Southern analysis. The probe was polymerase chain reaction amplified from an AQP5 genomic clone (13Krane C.M. Towne J.E. Menon A.G. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using 10 pmol of each primer (forward primer (4.5 Seq) 5′-CCGGCAGAAACAAAGACCT-3′; reverse primer (Pri Ext 3) 5′-CGCATCGTGCGCTCAGCG-3′); 0.25 mm each dNTP, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 60 mm Tris-HCl at pH 9.0, 12.5 mm (NH4)2 SO4, 10 ng of 2.1/4.5 plasmid DNA (11Fischer D. Ship J.A. Special Care Dent. 1997; 17: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), 0.1 unit of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. Polymerase chain reaction was performed in an MJ PTC-100 Thermocycler device (Watertown, MA) with the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min; (92 °C for 30 s −57 °C for 1 min −72 °C for 1 min) 35 times; −72 °C for 7 min. Products were separated by gel electrophoresis on a 1% low melting point agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 × TAE buffer and gel extracted (Qiagen gel extraction kit, Valencia, CA). The replacement construct deletes 55 bp of intron 2, the entire exon 3 (84 bp), and 467 bp of intron 3, and replaces them with the 1.6-kb PGK-neomycin cassette. ES cell lines with a correctly targeted Aqp5 allele resulting from homologous recombination were identified by the presence of a neomycin-containing (5.5 kb) and wild-type (4.5 kb) BamHI fragment. Two ES cell clones (175 and 187) were used in blastocyst-mediated transgenesis (16Stewart C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 823-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). 11 mice, 30–90% chimeric for the ES cell-derived 129SvJ agouti coat color, were generated. Germline transmission of the targeted allele was obtained from five chimeric male matings to outbred Black Swiss females. Those offspring carrying 129SvJ-derived genetic material were identified by their agouti coat color, and those carrying the targeted allele were determined by Southern analysis of tail DNA using the diagnostic probe described above. Intercross sibling matings of the F1 animals heterozygous for the targeted allele were used to establish recombinant inbred 129SvJ × Black-Swiss Aqp5 targeted lines. Mice used throughout this study wereAqp5 +/+ , Aqp5 +/−, andAqp5 −/− age- and sex-matched littermates from the F3 generation of recombinant inbredAqp5 targeted 129SvJ × Black Swiss genetic background. Gross histological analysis was performed by Dr. Greg Boivin (Department of Comparative Pathology, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine) on submandibular, sublingual, and parotid glands from Aqp5 +/+,Aqp5 + /−, andAqp5 −/− age- and sex-matched littermates by light microscopic analysis of paraformaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections (not shown). Total RNA was prepared from submandibular, sublingual, and parotid glands dissected from adultAqp5 +/+, Aqp5 +/−, andAqp5 −/− littermates and analyzed by Northern blot with an AQP5 cDNA clone as described (13Krane C.M. Towne J.E. Menon A.G. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Equal loading and quality of RNA samples were confirmed by the relative abundance of the 28 S and 18 S rRNA bands visualized by UV illumination of the ethidium bromide-stained gel. Total membrane preparations from submandibular, sublingual, and parotid glands were isolated from adultAqp5 +/+, Aqp5 +/−, andAqp5 −/− littermates and analyzed by immunoblotting with 0.5 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-AQP5 peptide derived antibody (LL639) as described (13Krane C.M. Towne J.E. Menon A.G. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Equal loading of membrane samples was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Parotid and sublingual acini from adult (8–20 weeks old) Aqp5 +/+ andAqp5 −/− age- and sex-matched littermates were dispersed as described previously (17Evans R.L. Bell S.M. Schultheis P.J. Shull G.E. Melvin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29025-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were killed by exsanguination after exposure to CO2 gas. The parotid and sublingual glands were quickly removed, trimmed of connective tissues, and minced finely in digestion medium (Eagle's modified essential medium, Biofluids, Inc., Rockville, MD) containing collagenase P (0.3 mg/7.5 ml/animal) + 1% bovine serum albumin. The minced glands were incubated at 37 °C in a shaker with continuous agitation (100 cycles/min). After the first 20-min interval the minced glands were dispersed by gentle pipetting (10 times) with a 10-ml plastic pipette and centrifuged (210 × g for 15 s). The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 7.5 ml of collagenase digestion medium for an additional 40 min, and the acinar cells were then rinsed and harvested by centrifugation. The dispersed acinar cells were loaded with the fluoroprobe calcein by incubation for 15 min at room temperature in 2 μmcalcein-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cell volume was estimated by confocal microscopy, as described (18Schreiber R. Nitschke R. Greger R. Kunzelmann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 270: 1908-1912Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to adhere to the base of a superfusion chamber mounted on an Olympus PMT2 fluorescence microscope interfaced with an UltimaTM confocal microscope (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). Intracellular dye was excited with 488 nm band of an argon laser and emitted fluorescence measured at 530 nm. Changes in cell volume were monitored by measuring the fluorescence intensity of calcein within a defined intracellular volume. In combination with an Olympus DplanApo 40× objective, a 225-μm confocal pinhole produces an ∼4-μm-thick optical section in the z direction. Using UltimaTM software, an x-y area of the two-dimensional image was circumscribed within individual acini. In some experiments, cell volume was estimated using a Nikon Diaphot 200 microscope interfaced with an Axon Imaging Workbench system (Foster City, CA). Cells were excited at 490 nm, and emitted fluorescence was measured at 530 nm. The initial linear rate of cell volume change was used as an index of acinar cell water permeability. Cell volume was correlated with fluorescence by in situ calibration of the dye performed using solutions of different osmolalities. The relationship between dye fluorescence and the volume change was linear over a volume range from +30% to −30%, which is within the physiological range of cell volume changes observed in acinar cells. Cell volume was expressed in arbitrary units as 1/normalized calcein fluorescence. The initial linear rate of cell volume change was used as an index of acinar cell water permeability. Aqp5 +/+ andAqp5 −/− parotid and sublingual acinar cells were enzymatically dispersed and loaded with fluorescent dye as described above and subsequently equilibrated in an isosmotic (∼300 mosm), intracellular-like solution to eliminate ion gradients. The solution contained 15 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 75 mm potassium gluconate, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.33 mmNaH2PO4, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 1.2 mm CaCl2. A 30% hyperosmotic shock was induced by perfusion of acini in the above solution containing 90 mm sucrose, and the rate of cell volume change was determined (“control” rate). Sucrose was then removed to permit the cell volume to reequilibrate before exposure to 1 mmHgCl2 for 5 min. The same cells were then exposed to a second hypertonic shock in the presence of HgCl2. The rate of volume change in the presence of 1 mm HgCl2was used to calculate the mercury-sensitive water permeability of acinar cells. Aqp5 +/+ andAqp5 −/− parotid and sublingual acinar cells were enzymatically dispersed and loaded with fluorescent dye as above, and then equilibrated in an isosmotic physiological solution containing 135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.33 mmNaH2PO4, 20 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, 0.8 mm MgSO4, and 1.2 mm CaCl2. Hyposmotic cell swelling was induced by switching the perfusate to the above solution after diluting by 30% with water. Cell volume change was measured as described above by monitoring the change in calcein fluorescence. The rate of RVD was determined over the course of ∼300 s while the cells remained in the hyposmotic solution. AdultAqp5 +/+ andAqp5 −/− age- and sex-matched littermates (12–16 weeks of age, n = 6 each group) were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 300 mg of chloral hydrate/kg of body weight and then stimulated with either 2 or 10 mg of pilocarpine HCl/kg of body weight (BW). Whole saliva was collected, representing a combination of parotid, submandibular, and sublingual secretions, with a very minor component from minor salivary, nasal, and tracheal glands. Saliva was collected from the lower cheek pouch by a suction device at intervals of 5, 10, and 15 min and expressed as μl/min. The osmolality of the saliva was measured using a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor 5500, Logan, UT). AdultAqp5 +/+ andAqp5 −/− littermates (n = 12 each genotype; n = 6 male,n = 6 female per genotype) were housed one per metabolic cage and acclimated for 48 h prior to urine collection. Mice had free access to drinking water and standard 1% NaCl mouse chow diet throughout the experiment. Base-line urine samples were collected over a period of 24 h for 3 consecutive days, and the volume, electrolyte composition, and osmolality were recorded. Aliquots of urine samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min to remove any suspended material, and the supernatants were used to measure the osmolality by freezing point depression on a Fiske One-Ten Osmometer (Norwood, MA). Sodium and potassium concentrations (meq/liter) were determined using a Ciba-Corning Flame photometer, model 480 (Medfield, MA), and chloride (meq/liter) was determined using a Labconco Digital Chloridometer (Kansas City, MO). The volume of water intake/24 h was recorded. Body weight was recorded prior to acclimation and at every 24-h time point. The mean average of 3 days of collection was calculated for each parameter measured, normalized for body weight, and used in statistical analysis comparing sex-matched wild-typeversus knockout mice. Tail vein blood (50 μl) was collected from adult Aqp5 +/+ andAqp5 −/− age- and sex-matched littermates (12–16 weeks of age, n = 6 each genotype) and analyzed for gases, electrolytes, and pH as described (19Spicer A.

All cell volume measurements were expressed in arbitrary units as 1/normalized calcein fluorescence for the indicated number of acini studied (n). Experiments were repeated using at least three separate preparations. Data were analyzed by a two-tailed Student's t test, and differences between test and control values at p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. The Aqp5targeted allele was generated by replacing 600 bp of the mouseAqp5 gene, which includes a portion of intron 2, all of exon 3, and a portion of intron 3, with the neomycin resistance gene (Fig.1 A). The targeted replacement results in the deletion of extracellular loop E of the mouse AQP5 protein, which contains the highly conserved Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motif (20Heymann J.B. Engel A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1039-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and the mercury-sensitive cysteine residue at position 182 (13Krane C.M. Towne J.E. Menon A.G. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Alterations in the NPA motifs in either the B or E loops have been shown to disrupt water permeability in aquaporin family members (21Jung J.S. Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Six independently derived Aqp5 targeted ES cell lines were identified by the presence of both 5.5-kb and 4.5-kb BamHI fragments by Southern analysis corresponding to the targeted and wild-type alleles respectively (not shown). Chimeras were generated through blastocyst injection of two ES cell lines, and germline transmission was obtained. A representative Southern blot from an F1 heterozygous mating is shown in Fig. 1 B. We observed a birth genotypic ratio of 1 (+/+): 2 (+/−): 0.5 (−/−), suggesting a role for Aqp5 in prenatal survival. AdultAqp5 −/− mice weighed ∼90% of their Aqp5 +/+ andAqp5 +/− age- and sex-matched littermates (not shown). No difference in morbidity, mortality, or longevity was observed among the three genotypes from birth to >1 year of age (not shown). Submandibular, sublingual, and parotid glands from 12–16-week-old Aqp5 /+,Aqp5 +/−, andAqp5 −/− littermates were histologically normal as revealed by light microscopic analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections (not shown). Northern analysis was performed on total RNA isolated from parotid glands fromAqp5 +/+, Aqp5+/−, andAqp5 −/− littermates using a mouse AQP5 cDNA probe containing the entire open reading frame and the 3′-untranslated region. A 1.8-kb band corresponding to the mouse AQP5 transcript was observed in RNA from +/+ and +/− mice but was not present in the RNA from Aqp5 −/−glands (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the targeted replacement of theAqp5 locus results in the absence of AQP5 mRNA inAqp5 −/− mouse salivary glands. Identical results were obtained with total RNA from the sublingual and submandibular glands (not shown). Immunoblotting of total membrane fractions prepared from parotid glands from Aqp5 +/+,Aqp5 +/−, andAqp5 −/− mice with an anti-AQP5 peptide-derived rabbit polyclonal antibody identified both the 27-kDa and 29-kDa AQP5 immunoreactive bands in Aqp5 +/+and Aqp5 +/− mice, which were reported previously in mouse salivary glands (13Krane C.M. Towne J.E. Menon A.G. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Neither the 27-kDa nor the 29-kDa bands were present inAqp5 −/− membrane fractions (Fig.1 D). Therefore, the targeted replacement of theAqp5 locus ablates AQP5 protein production and results in AQP5 null mice. Identical results were obtained with total membrane fractions from the sublingual and submandibular glands (not shown). A previous study has shown thatAqp5-deficient salivary glands produce less saliva in response to a supramaximal concentration of a cholinergic agonist (80 mg/kg pilocarpine), and the saliva was hypertonic (420 mosm) (10Ma T. Song Y. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20071-20074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) rather than hypotonic as in wild-type mice. In the present study, two different physiological concentrations of agonist (2 and 10 mg of pilocarpine HCl/kg of body weight, injected intraperitoneally) were used to stimulate salivary secretion. The pilocarpine-stimulated salivary flow rate was determined forAqp5 +/+ andAqp5 −/− mice at three 5-min intervals over the course of 15 min (see Fig. 2). The flow rate forAqp5 −/−mice at all three intervals with both pilocarpine concentrations was inhibited significantly compared with the rate observed for Aqp5 +/+ mice (range = 45–80% of the control rate; mean ± S.E. = 64.7 ± 6.8% inhibition). Thus, AQP5 deficiency results in a sustained ∼65% decrease in the rate of pilocarpine-stimulated saliva flow regardless of the agonist concentration used. These data demonstrate that AQP5 is critically important to salivation, independent of the magnitude of receptor activation. In addition to flow rate measurements, the osmolality of stimulated salivary secretions was determined for three 5-min intervals over a 15-min duration after stimulation with 2 or 10 mg of pilocarpine/kg of body weight (TableI). Osmolality was increased significantly (p < 0.01) in the saliva fromAqp5 −/−mice compared with their wild-type littermates, and it remained increased over the collection period at all three intervals (Table I). These results indicate that the final osmotic composition of stimulated saliva is affected by AQP5 expression.Table IOsmolality of pilocarpine-stimulated salivary secretionAgonist concentrationOsmolalityAqp5+/+Aqp5−/−2 mg pilocarpine/kg body weight5 min165.8 ± 6.5225.8 ± 16.6*10 min174.0 ± 11.1229.7 ± 18.4*15 min173.0 ± 10.7246.8 ± 17.0*10 mg pilocarpine/kg body weight5 min196.5 ± 4.1257.0 ± 9.8*10 min216.5 ± 10.1271.8 ± 14.6*15 min221.5 ± 6.9272.3 ± 10.1*Statistically significant values are indicated (*) (p< 0.05).

To determine whether the absence of AQP5 affects whole animal fluid homeostasis, water intake and urinary volume output were monitored in adultAqp5 +/+ andAqp5 −/− mice (TableII). Interestingly, there were no significant differences in the volume of water intake or urine excreted by Aqp5 −/− mice compared with their age- and sex-matched littermates. In addition, urine osmolality, potassium, sodium, and chloride concentrations did not differ between wild-type and AQP5 knockout mice (Table II).Table IIWater intake, urine output, urine osmolality and electrolytesWater intakeUrine outputUrine osmolality (n= 12)Urine electrolytesMale (n = 6)Female (n = 6)Male (n = 6)Female (n = 6)Na+K+Cl−ml/g body weight ± S.E.ml/g body weight ± S.E.mosm/kg H2Omeq/literWild-type0.151 ± 0.0130.136 ± 0.0190.074 ± 0.0120.046 ± 0.0072824 ± 206427.6 ± 43.1298.0 ± 25.1368.6 ± 20.3Knockout0.124 ± 0.0200.135 ± 0.0120.055 ± 0.070.035 ± 0.0083149 ± 244.9459.4 ± 43.7333.0 ± 25.5417.2 ± 24.1Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E.

To examine the role of AQP5 in the maintenance of blood gas and plasma electrolyte homeostasis, blood samples from awake adultAqp5 +/+ andAqp5 −/− mice were collected and analyzed for plasma electrolytes, blood pH, and blood gas levels. No significant differences were observed in these parameters when comparing the AQP5 knockout mice with wild-type littermates (TableIII). Taken together, the results shown in Tables II and III demonstrate that the hyposalivation observed inAqp5 −/− mice is notcaused by changes in whole animal fluid and electrolyte homeostasis.Table IIIBlood gas and plasma electrolyte measurements of Aqp5+/+ and Aqp5−/− miceBlood gas/electrolytepHpCO2pO2Na+K+Cl−HCO3−mm Hgmeq/literAqp5+/+7.436 ± 0.01131.950 ± 1.99483.833 ± 5.703149.333 ± 0.4225.945 ± 0.252113.000 ± 0.85621.240 ± 0.823Aqp5−/−7.437 ± 0.01535.160 ± 0.82982.460 ± 3.795150.8 ± 0.5835.968 ± 0.288113.000 ± 0.83722.775 ± 0.641Values are the means ± S.E.

Preston G.M. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1908-1912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). To examine whether AQP5 is involved in acinar cell water permeability, the rate of volume change was determined in wild-type cells in response to a hypertonic stress in the presence and absence of HgCl2. Water movement was osmotically driven by introducing a 30% hypertonic shock (see “Experimental Procedures”). Parotid (Fig. 3 A) and sublingual (Fig.4 A) acinar cell volumes were measured by monitoring the fluorescence intensity of calcein within a defined intracellular volume, and the rate of cell shrinkage was used as an index of water permeability. The same cells were allowed to recover in isotonic medium prior to testing the Hg2+sensitivity of the hypertonicity-induced changes in cell volume. The rate of hypertonicity-induced cell shrinkage was then determined in the presence of HgCl2 after a 5-min preincubation in 1 mm HgCl2. An approximate 50% decrease (p < 0.0001, n ≥ 36) in the rate of shrinkage was observed in the"
https://openalex.org/W2006027132,"Homologues of Drosophila Trp (transient receptor potential) form plasma membrane channels that mediate Ca2+ entry following the activation of phospholipase C by cell surface receptors. Among the seven Trp homologous found in mammals, Trp3 has been shown to interact with and respond to IP3 receptors (IP3Rs) for activation. Here we show that Trp4 and other Trp proteins also interact with IP3Rs. The IP3R-binding domain also interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a Ca2+-dependent manner with affinities ranging from 10 nm for Trp2 to 290 nm for Trp6. In addition, other binding sites for CaM and IP3Rs are present in the α but not the μ isoform of Trp4. In the presence of Ca2+, the Trp-IP3R interaction is inhibited by CaM. However, a synthetic peptide representing a Trp-binding domain of IP3Rs inhibited the binding of CaM to Trp3, -6, and -7 more effectively than that to Trp1, -2, -4, and -5. In inside-out membrane patches, Trp4 is activated strongly by calmidazolium, an antagonist of CaM, and a high (50 μm) but not a low (5 μm) concentration of the Trp-binding peptide of the IP3R. Our data support the view that both CaM and IP3Rs play important roles in controlling the gating of Trp-based channels. However, the sensitivity and responses to CaM and IP3Rs differ for each Trp.

The release of Ca2+ from internal stores in turn activates store-operated channels (SOCs) located on the plasma membrane, allowing Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. The store-operated Ca2+ influx, also known as capacitative Ca2+ entry (1Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar, 2Putney Jr., J.W.

In contrast to the well defined roles of IP3 and IP3Rs in Ca2+ release, the molecular makeup of channels that mediate Ca2+ influx and their gating mechanism(s) remain to be elucidated. Drosophila transient receptor potential (Trp) protein and its mammalian homologues have been shown to form either Ca2+ selective or nonselective cation channels that mediate Ca2+ influx in response to phospholipase C activation (5Birnbaumer L.

Expression of individual Trp proteins in heterologous systems revealed that Trp channels may be activated by a number of intermediaries involved in the phospholipase C-stimulated signaling cascade, including Ca2+ (10Zitt C.

Wissenbach U. Zimmer S. Trost C. Marquart A. Murakami M. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6166-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar)), it remains controversial whether all Trp proteins participate in forming SOCs (18Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R.

Perhaps the answer lies within the structural organization of the channel, which could be composed of four different Trp subunits (5Birnbaumer L. Zhu X. Jiang M. Boulay G. Peyton M. Vannier B.

A recent example showed that coexpression of twoDrosophila store-insensitive Trp proteins, Trpγ and Trp-like (TrpL), led to the formation of a SOC (20Xu X.Z. Chien F. Butler A. Salkoff L. Montell C. Neuron. 2000; 26: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, the store sensitivity may be reconstituted with the proper combination of different Trp subunits. Consistent with this idea, Trp1, Trp3, and Trp4 have been shown to be part of SOCs in human submandibular gland cells, neurons, and adrenal cortex cells, respectively (15Liu X. Wang W. Singh B.B.

Recent studies showed that IP3Rs are involved in the activation of Trp3. Following the initial demonstration that human Trp3 (hTrp3) in inside-out membrane patches was activated by IP3Rs in the presence of IP3 (12Kiselyov K. Xu X. Kuo T.H. Mozhayeva G. Pessah I.

Overexpression of short peptide fragments containing these binding sites altered the activity of endogenous store-operated Ca2+ influx in HEK293 cells (14Boulay G. Brown D. Qin N. Jiang M.

While the association with IP3Rs has also been shown for Trp1 and Trp6 by coimmunoprecipitation (14Boulay G. Brown D. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M. Mikoshiba K.

J. 2000; 350: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), it remains to be determined whether direct interaction with IP3Rs is common for all Trp proteins. In this study, we examined murine Trp4 (mTrp4) for interaction with the first and the stronger Trp3-binding domain of IP3R3 (F2q; Glu669–Asp698) (14Boulay G. Brown D. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A.

In addition, we examined the interaction between Trp4 and calmodulin (CaM), which has been shown to bind to the C termini ofDrosophila Trp (25Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and TrpL (26Warr C.G. Kelly L.E. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and has been implicated to cause inactivation of TrpL (28Scott K. Sun Y. Beckingham K. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1997; 91: 375-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We report here the presence of two CaM-binding and at least two IP3R3-binding sites at the C terminus of Trp4. The first CaM-binding site overlaps closely with one of the IP3R3-binding site. Common binding sites for CaM and IP3Rs also exist in other Trp proteins. In functional studies, we show that currents are activated in inside-out membrane patches excised from Trp4-expressing HEK293 cells by calmidazolium (CMZ), an antagonist of CaM, and by a peptide representing one of the Trp-binding domains of IP3R3. Fragments of IP3Rs and Trps were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All sense primers contain an NcoI recognition site at the 5′ with ATG in frame with the codon for the first amino acid. The antisense primers start with an A nucleotide followed by the antisense codon for the last amino acid. PCR products were subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen), and nucleotide compositions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion constructs were made by subcloning NcoI/EcoRI fragments into a modified pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in which anNcoI site was added after the BamHI site. By design, the insert in each fusion protein starts with a Met and ends with a “TAA” stop codon (T comes from the A in the antisense primer, while AA comes from the pCRII vector). Complementary DNA for enhanced blue fluorescence protein (EBFP) was excised from pEBFP-C1 (CLONTECH) and subcloned into pAGA (29Sanford J. Codina J. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9570-9579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) atNcoI/SmaI sites, while that for maltose-binding protein (MBP) was amplified from pMAL-C2 (New England Biolabs) by PCR, excised with MfeI/NcoI, and subcloned into pAGA at EcoRI/NcoI sites. Constructs for EBFP fusion proteins contained inserts downstream from the EBFP coding region and were made using existing restriction sites on mouse trp4 at the 5′-end and XbaI at the 3′-end. MBP fusion proteins contain the first 322 residues of MBP followed by inserts, of which the cDNAs were subcloned intoNcoI/EcoRI sites. Preparation of GST fusion proteins; 35S-labeled CaM, EBFP, and MBP fusion proteins; and procedures for pull-down experiments are as described (30Qin N. Olcese R. Bransby M. Lin T. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2435-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). For interaction with CaM, CaM-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. The binding buffer used for IP3R3-Trp interaction contains 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5‥ Lubrol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The buffer used for CaM-Trp interaction generally contains 120 mm KCl, 0.5‥ Lubrol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EGTA, 9.96 mm CaCl2. pH was adjusted to 7.5. The estimated free Ca2+ concentration for the buffer is 10 μm. However, because EGTA is a poor buffer for Ca2+ concentration at the micromolar range, the actual free Ca2+ concentration of this buffer is about 70 μm as determined by spectrofluorometric measurements using Fura2FF (TEF Laboratories, Austin, TX) as a low affinity Ca2+ indicator and HEDTA-buffered solutions as standards. For the determination of Ca2+-dependence of Trp binding to CaM, HEDTA or nitrilotriacetic acid instead of EGTA was used, and total CaCl2 was added according to the MaxChelator program (C. Patton, Stanford University) to give rise to desired free Ca2+ concentrations. 35S-Labeled MBP fusion proteins containing the CaM-binding sites were incubated with CaM-Sepharose at room temperature for 30 min in varying free Ca2+ concentrations. Each sample was washed twice with the same binding buffer that was used for the incubation; thus, the free Ca2+ concentration was kept unchanged. Bound proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The radioactivity of [35S]MBP fusion proteins retained was quantified by phosphorimaging analysis. The percentage of maximal increase over the value obtained in 10 mm EGTA with no added Ca2+was fitted with the Hill equationI/I max =C n /(C n + (K12) n), whereI/I max represents the relative binding, C is the Ca2+ concentration,n is the Hill coefficient, and K 12 is the Ca2+ concentration that gives rise to half-maximal binding. For competition studies, recombinant human CaM was prepared from bacterial lysate using phenyl-Sepharose (Sigma) as described (31Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Lee M.S. Heo W.D. Seo H.Y. Yoon H.W. Hong J.C.

Peptide F2v (EYLSIEYSEEEVWLTWTD) was synthesized by Research Genetics. CaM or peptide F2v, in the desired final concentrations, was included in the binding and washing buffers containing 50 or 70 μmfree Ca2+. All fluorescence measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS5 Spectrofluorometer at 22 °C. Peptides for CaM-binding sites of Trp1–7 were synthesized by Waterloo Peptide Synthesis (University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada). Peptide for the second CaM-binding site of mTrp4α was synthesized by the Tufts University Core Facility (Tuft University, Boston, MA). Phosphodiesterase activity was assayed by monitoring the hydrolysis of fluorescent 2′-methylanthraniloyl cGMP (8 μm) in 1 ml of solution containing 200 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 90 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 100 μm free Ca2+, 25 nm CaM, and the desired amount of peptide. Samples were excited at 330 nm, and emission at 450 nm was measured. The dissociation constant (K d ) with Ca2+/CaM was calculated from the activation curves of phosphodiesterase by CaM in the absence and the presence of the peptide as described (32Erickson-Viitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells stably expressing mTrp4 (T4-1 and T4-60 cells) and culture conditions were as described (33Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes 2 days prior to patch clamp recordings. Conditions for recording from inside-out patches were essentially as described (34Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3168-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained 140 mm Na-Hepes, 5 mm NaCl, and 2 mmCaCl2, pH 7.5. Inside-out patches were excised from the Trp4 cells into a Ca2+-free intracellular solution containing 140 mm potassium gluconate, 5 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. CMZ, CaM, and peptide F2v were diluted to the final concentration in the intracellular solution containing no Ca2+ (for F2v) or 18 μm free Ca2+(for CMZ) and were applied to the cytoplasmic side of excised patches through perfusion. A step protocol containing continuous alternating steps to 40 and −40 mV, each for 1 s, from holding at 0 mV was applied throughout the experiments. Currents were recorded at sampling frequency of 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Currents recorded at −40 mV from 100 episodes under each condition were averaged using pCLAMP 8 (Axon Instruments) after digital filtering at 500 Hz and base-line adjustment. A previous study showed that a GST fusion protein containing the F2q fragment of human IP3R3 (Glu669–Asp698) interacted with the C terminus of hTrp3 (14Boulay G. Brown D. Qin N. Jiang M. Dietrich A. Zhu M.X. Chen Z. Birnbaumer M. Mikoshiba K. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14955-14960Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The Trp3 peptides shown to interact with IP3R3 were T3C7 (Met742–Glu795) and T3C8 (Gln777–Asp797). T3C8 bound to IP3R3 more weakly than T3C7 and thus represents a partial IP3R-binding domain of Trp3. Because the sequence homology at the regions that align to T3C7 is relatively low (13, 13, and 17‥ identical between Trp3 and Trp1, Trp2, and Trp4, respectively), it was difficult to predict whether the IP3R-binding domain is conserved among all Trp homologues. Therefore, we tested the binding of GST-IP3R3F2q to mTrp4. 35S-Labeled MBP and EBFP fusion proteins containing the N and C terminus of mTrp4, respectively, were synthesized in vitro and incubated with GST or GST-IP3R3F2q bound to glutathione-Sepharose. Fig.1 A shows the Trp4 regions present in the fusion proteins, and Fig. 1 B shows that while MBP (M) or EBFP (E) alone and MBP-Trp4 N terminus (NT) have no specific interaction with IP3R3F2q, the EBFP-Trp4 C-terminal fusion protein (CT) binds to GST-IP3R3F2q. To examine the interaction between Trp4 and CaM, we incubated the fusion proteins with CaM-Sepharose. Only EBFP-T4CT (CT) interacted with CaM. The binding of T4CT to CaM was very weak in the absence of Ca2+, but in the presence of 70 μm Ca2+, it was greatly increased (Fig. 1 B). We divided T4CT into two portions. CT1 (residues 659–750) includes the sequence homologous to T3C7 of Trp3, while CT2 (residues 733–974) contains the more C-terminal sequence unique to Trp4. Interestingly, both CT1 and CT2 bind strongly to GST-IP3R3F2q and to Ca2+/CaM. Another N-terminal construct (NT1) and the transmembrane region (TM) of Trp4 did not interact with IP3R3F2q or Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 1 C). The overlapping sequence between CT1 and CT2 is relatively conserved among the Trp homologues (11 out 20 amino acids are identical between Trp3 and Trp4). However, an EBFP fusion protein containing this sequence (Cf) did not interact with either IP3R3F2q or Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 1 D). On the other hand, a construct that contains mostly the sequence equivalent to T3C7 but not T4Cf (Cc) interacted with both IP3R3F2q and Ca2+/CaM. These results indicate that just as T3C7, a similar region at the C terminus of Trp4 also binds to IP3R3. In addition, there is at least one additional IP3R-binding site more C-terminal to the previously defined site. Moreover, both IP3R-binding regions bind to Ca2+/CaM. To determine how close the first CaM-binding site of Trp4 is to the site that binds to IP3R3F2q, we produced MBP- and EBFP-fusion proteins containing smaller fragments of T4Cc and tested their binding to GST-IP3R3F2q and Ca2+/CaM. Fig.2 shows the composition of the fusion proteins and the binding results. In general, Trp4 fragments that bound to IP3R3F2q also bound to Ca2+/CaM. The smallest fragment that binds to IP3R3F2q and Ca2+/CaM with nearly the same strength as T4Ccis T4Cw (Arg695–Glu724). Removing two residues from either the N or the C terminus of T4Cwreduced the interaction with both IP3R3F2q and Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 2 C, T4Cv and T4Cx). Smaller fragments, such as Ca, Caa, and Cab, had much weaker binding to IP3R3F2q, and this was also accompanied by greatly reduced binding to Ca2+/CaM. Therefore, the binding sites for CaM and for the IP3R cannot be separated by deletion studies, indicating that a common sequence, referred to as the CaM/IP3R binding (CIRB) domain, is involved in the interaction with CaM and with the IP3R. The minimal domains that bind to CaM and IP3R3F2q at the CT2 region were sought in a similar manner (Fig. 3). However, it appears that the CT2 IP3R-binding domain is not confined to a short sequence like the CIRB domain. When CT2 was divided into CT2a and CT2b, both retained weak interaction with IP3R3F2q (Fig.3 B). Further analyses suggested that the region from Gly781 to Ser864 retains significant binding to IP3R3F2q (Fig. 3 C). Interestingly, molecular cloning and immunoblot analysis have revealed the presence of two major isoforms of Trp4, Trp4α and Trp4μ (33Tang Y. Tang J. Chen Z. Trost C. Flockerzi V. Li M. Ramesh V. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37559-37564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The μ form lacks the 84 amino acids corresponding to Gly781–Ser864 of the α form. Thus, CT2μ binds very weakly to IP3R3F2q (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to IP3R3F2q, CaM binds to a short, confined sequence in CT2, CT2p (Arg787–Asn812, Fig. 3,C and D). Removing two residues from its N terminus (CT2r) nearly abolished the binding, whereas removing two residues from its C terminus (CT2q) reduced the binding by 45‥, as determined by phosphorimaging analysis from two independent experiments. Although CT2p is contained within the CT2 IP3R3F2q-binding region, it does not bind to the IP3R fragment. Therefore, the binding sites for CaM and IP3R3F2q in the CT2 region do not overlap as closely as the CIRB sequence. Because the CaM binding site is not present in TRP4μ, CT2μ does not bind to Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 3 B). As shown in Fig.4, regions equivalent to T4Cwfrom hTrp1, mTrp2, hTrp3, mTrp5, mTrp6, mTrp7, andDrosophila Trp and TrpL also interacted with both GST-IP3R3F2q and Ca2+/CaM. For TrpL, the CIRB domain is in addition to the two CaM-binding sites (710, 854) identified previously (26Warr C.G. Kelly L.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 27Trost C. Marquart A. Zimmer S. Philipp S. Cavalie A. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For Drosophila Trp, the CIRB domain is within a previously reported CaM-binding region (683) (25Chevesich J. Kreuz A.J. Montell C. Neuron. 1997; 18: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For Trp3, the CIRB domain is the only CaM-binding domain, because deletion of this site eliminated the binding and the regulation of Trp3 activity by Ca2+/CaM (34Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3168-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This may also be the case for Trp6 and Trp7, since they are very similar to Trp3. Trp1 terminates soon after the CIRB sequence and therefore is unlikely to have a second binding site at the C terminus. The C-terminal sequence of mTrp2 (residues 944–1072) and of mTrp5 (residues 762–975) interacted with both Ca2+/CaM and GST-IP3R3F2q (not shown), suggesting that the second binding sites for the two modulators are conserved in Trp2, Trp4α, and Trp5, despite the fact that the homology among the three Trps is very low at these regions. Using synthetic peptides representing the CIRB domains of Trp1–7 and the second CaM-binding site of Trp4, we determined the affinities to range from 10 nm for mTrp2 to 290 nm for mTrp6 (Table I). The second CaM-binding site of Trp4 has lower affinity (600 nm) than the CIRB domains of all Trp proteins. The apparent affinities for Ca2+, as measured by in vitro binding assays using [35S]MBP-Trp fusion proteins and CaM-Sepharose, differed greatly from 1.0 μm for the second CaM-binding site of Trp4 to 44.2 μm for the CIRB domain of Trp5 (Table I). The Hill coefficients of Ca2+ dependence for the CaM-Trp interactions were about 1.5–3.5.Table IAffinities of Trp binding to CaMTrp typeAmino acid sequences of synthetic peptidesPositionsK d 1-aK d for CaM was determined by the phosphodiesterase assay as described under “Materials and Methods” using the peptides shown.Ca2+dependence1-bCa2+ dependence was determined by in vitro binding assays using35S-labeled MBP fusion proteins shown in Fig. 4 A and CaM-Sepharose.

Open table in a new tab Just as the CIRB domain is conserved in all Trp homologues, the F2q Trp-binding site is also conserved in the three known mammalian IP3Rs. Fig.5 A shows that regions homologous to IP3R3F2q from IP3R1 and IP3R2 also interacted with the C terminus of Trp3. The alignment of the three sequences indicates that only the C-terminal halves are conserved. Further experimentation using smaller segments of IP3R3F2q fused to GST showed that the C-terminal half of F2q (represented by F2v) is the minimal domain of IP3R3 that interacts with Trp3 (Fig. 5 B). In in vitro binding assays, we have shown that for T3C7, the interaction with IP3R3F2q was inhibited by purified recombinant human CaM and the binding to CaM was blocked by a synthetic peptide, composed of the sequence of F2v (34Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3168-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Peptide F2v appears to be a potent inhibitor for CaM binding to Trp3, because the competition was observed in a binding buffer that contained Ca2+, a condition under which CaM has a high affinity for Trp3.

The iodine-containing thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and thyroxine play essential roles in promoting the development and maturation of the nervous system, skeletal muscle, and lungs and in regulating intermediary metabolism in virtually all tissues. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is the primary hormonal regulator of thyroid function overall and has long been known to stimulate I− uptake activity in the thyroid (10Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 596-611PubMed Google Scholar). No thyroidal I− uptake is detected in humans whose serum TSH levels are suppressed (11Martino E. Bartalena L. Pinchera A. Braverman L.E. Utiger R.D. The Thyroid: A Fundamental and Clinical Text. 8th Ed. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia2000: 762-773Google Scholar). In addition, up-regulation of NIS thyroid expression and I−uptake activity by TSH has been demonstrated in rats in vivo(12Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N.

Biol. 1999; 19: 2051-2060Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). After TSH withdrawal a reduction of both intracellular cAMP levels and I− uptake activity is observed in FRTL-5 cells. This is a reversible process, as I− uptake activity can be restored either by TSH or agents that increase cAMP (13Weiss S.J. Philp N.J. Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Grollman E.F. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 18Ohno M. Zannini M. Levy O. Carrasco N. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell.

I− uptake activity surprisingly persists in membrane vesicles (MV) prepared from FRTL-5 cells that, when intact, have completely lost I− uptake activity due to prolonged TSH deprivation (19Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This suggests that mechanisms other than transcriptional might also operate to regulate NIS activity in response to TSH. Here we provide evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of NIS function by TSH. Our results show for the first time that NIS is a phosphoprotein and that the NIS phosphorylation pattern is regulated by TSH. Furthermore, our data indicate that in the absence of TSH, NIS is redistributed from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments. This suggests that under TSH deprivation, the loss of I−transport activity in FRTL-5 cells is due to NIS intracellular distribution. Interestingly and contrary to expectations, NIS is overexpressed in some thyroid cancers, notwithstanding their decreased I− uptake activity (20Arturi F. Russo D. Giuffrida D. Schlumberger M. Eur. J.

Moreover, overexpressed NIS in these cells is predominantly retained intracellularly.2 The intracellular NIS redistribution pattern that we observed in FRTL-5 cells maintained in the absence of TSH resembles that reported in thyroid tumors, underscoring the importance of elucidating the mechanisms that govern the subcellular localization of NIS.

Briefly, FRTL-5 cells kept in TSH(+) or TSH(−) medium were washed, harvested, and resuspended in ice-cold 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), containing aprotinin (90 μg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), leupeptin (4 μg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (0.8 mm) (Sigma). Cells were disrupted with a motor-driven Teflon pestle homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), aliquoted, and stored in liquid nitrogen. MV for immunoblot analysis were prepared as described above except that the final pellet was resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5). I− transport assays in intact cells were performed with 90% confluent FRTL-5 cells in 12-well plates that were kept either in 6H or 5H medium (23Weiss S.J. Philp N.J. Grollman E.F. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Briefly, after aspirating the culture medium, cells were washed two times with 0.5 ml of modified Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). Cells were incubated with HBSS buffer containing 20 μm Na125I (specific activity 50 Ci/mol) for 45 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Reactions were terminated by aspirating the radioactive solution and washing three times with cold HBSS. Intracellular 125I− was released by permeabilizing the cells with 500 μl of 95% cold ethanol and was quantitated in a γ-counter. DNA in each well was determined by the diphenylamine method (19Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). I− uptake was expressed as picomoles of I− per μg of DNA in each well. FRTL-5 MV were assayed as described (19Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). MV were thawed at 37 °C and placed on ice. Aliquots containing 50 μg of protein (10 μl) were assayed for 125I− uptake by incubating at room temperature (RT) with an equal volume (10 μl) of a solution containing 20 μm Na125I (specific activity 1.1 Ci/mmol), 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmHepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 2 mm methimazole, 200 mmNaCl, 30 μm NaClO4. Reactions were terminated at the 30-s time point by the addition of 3 ml of ice-cold quenching solution: 250 mm KCl, 1 mm methimazole, and 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), followed by rapid filtration through wet nitrocellulose filters (0.45-μm pore diameter). Radioactivity retained by MV was determined by quantitating filters in γ-counter. Data were standardized per mg of protein. SDS-9% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotting to nitrocellulose were performed as described previously (12Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted 1:2 with loading buffer and heated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to electrophoresis. Immunoblot analyses were also carried out as described (12Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (12Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Briefly, FRTL-5 cells in 60-mm plates kept in the presence or absence of TSH were washed and incubated for 30 min with cysteine- and methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with dialyzed 5% calf serum. Cells were labeled with 480 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Promix, DuPont) for the indicated times, followed by washes and incubation with regular media supplemented with 10× methionine/cysteine for the indicated times. Cells were lysed with 1% SDS in PBS containing aprotinin (90 μg/ml), leupeptin (4 μg/ml), and PMSF (0.8 mm), followed by a 16-fold dilution with 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 200 mm NaCl, 1% BSA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Preimmune serum and protein G fast flow Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were added and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. Lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were incubated with 1:40 dilution of anti-NIS antisera for 60 min at 4 °C, followed by the addition 30% of a slurry of protein G fast flow Sepharose beads incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. Beads were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min and alternately washed with low ionic strength buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)), with high ionic strength buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m LiCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)), and with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Samples were heated at 37 °C for 30 min in loading buffer prior to SDS electrophoresis. Gels were fixed and soaked in Fluoro-Hance (Research Products International). Gels were vacuum-dried and exposed for autoradiography at −70 °C. Cell surface biotinylation was performed in FRTL-5 cells kept in 6H or 5H medium as a modification of a method described previously (24Chen J.G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1479-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 12-well plates to 80% confluence. Cells were washed with PBS/CM (PBS with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mmMgCl2) and incubated twice for 20 min at 4 °C with 1.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin) (Pierce) in 20 mm Hepes (pH 8.5), 2 mm CaCl2, and 150 mm NaCl. Cells were washed twice for 20 min with PBS/CM-containing 100 mmglycine at 4 °C and lysed with 1% SDS in 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% of Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) containing aprotinin (90 μg/ml), leupeptin (4 μg/ml), and PMSF (0.8 mm), referred to as buffer A. Samples were diluted 10× with buffer A without SDS. Streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) were added to the lysate and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min to separate beads from the supernatant. Beads were washed 3× with buffer A without SDS and 2× with high ionic strength buffer (500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). The final wash was done with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Beads were resuspended in sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 75 °C. FRTL-5 cells in the presence of TSH were seeded onto poly-(lysine)-coated coverslips. Forty eight hours after seeding, cells were changed to 6H or 5H for the indicated times. Cells were washed 3× with PBS/CM, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at RT, and rinsed with PBS/CM. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton in PBS/CM plus 0.2% BSA (PBS/CM/TB) for 10 min at RT. Cells were quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS/CM for 10 min at RT and rinsed with PBS/CM/TB. Cells were incubated with 8 nm anti-NIS Ab in PBS/CM/TB for 1 h at RT, washed, and incubated with 1:700 dilution of fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ab (Vector Laboratories). After washing, cells on the coverslips were mounted onto microscope slides using an antifade kit from Molecular Probes. Coverslips were sealed with quick-dry nail polish and allowed to dry in the dark for 2 h at RT and stored at 4 °C. NIS immunofluorescence was analyzed with a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 Laser Scanning Confocal MRC 600, equipped with a Nikon Eclipse epifluorescent microscope. 32P in vivo labeling was performed as described previously (25Orr G.A. Han E.K. Browne P.C. Nieves E. O'Connor B.M. Yang C.P. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25054-25062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 70–80% confluency in 100-mm tissue culture plates and incubated for 30 min in 4 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% calf serum. Then 100 μCi/ml ortho[32P]phosphoric acid (Pi) (DuPont) was added to the culture medium and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed with 1% SDS in PBS containing phosphatase inhibitors (50 nm calyculin (Sigma), 10 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 4 μm cantharidin (Sigma), 2 mm vanadate, and 100 μm phenylarsyn oxide (Calbiochem)) and protease inhibitors (3 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.8 mm PMSF). After lysis, NIS was immunoprecipitated, subjected to electrophoresis, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. NIS was visualized by autoradiography after 3 h at −70 °C. The NIS band was excised from the nitrocellulose and digested with trypsin as described (26Luo K.X. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, nitrocellulose strips were treated with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-30 in 100 nm acetic acid for 30 min, washed with water, and digested withl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (10 μg) (Worthington) in 100 mmNH4HCO3 (pH 8.2), 1 mmCaCl2 for 24 h at 37 °C. Under these conditions, ∼60% of the 32P was released from the nitrocellulose. The phosphopeptide map was performed as described previously (25Orr G.A. Han E.K. Browne P.C. Nieves E. O'Connor B.M. Yang C.P. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25054-25062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptic phosphopeptides were separated in two dimensions on cellulose thin layer plates by electrophoresis at pH 1.9 for 50 min at 650 V, followed by chromatography (1-butanol/pyridine/acetic acid/H2O, 50:33:1:40, v/v). Approximately 1000 and 500 cpm were loaded onto each plate from TSH(+) and TSH(−) cells, respectively. Plates were visualized by autoradiography after 3 days at −70 °C. We measured Na+-dependent, perchlorate-inhibitable (i.e. NIS-mediated) I− uptake activity in intact FRTL-5 cells over the course of 10 days after TSH was removed from the culture medium and in MV prepared from these cells (Fig.1 A). MV are a pool of sealed vesicles from all subcellular compartments except the nuclear membrane. As reported previously (19Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Salvador C. Dai G. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3789-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), while I− transport activity decreased by 75% in intact cells 3 days after removal of TSH (Fig.1 A, empty bars), I− transport activity only decreased by 25% in MV (Fig. 1 A, filled bars). By 5 days after TSH withdrawal, I− uptake was completely abolished in intact cells, whereas in MV it was still as high as 60% of the initial activity. To determine whether the reduction of I−uptake in intact cells was due to a decrease in NIS expression, we subjected MV from these cells to immunoblot analysis with anti-NIS Ab (Fig. 1 B), and we monitored the ∼85-kDa broad band corresponding to fully glycosylated NIS (12Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although NIS expression decreased to ∼50% of its initial level after 3 days of TSH deprivation, NIS expression in MV remained detectable after 7–10 days (Fig. 1 B), i.e. even after I− uptake in intact cells was completely abolished (Fig. 1 A). That I− transport activity in MV from TSH-deprived cells persists during the entire time course is consistent with NIS expression in these cells. To test whether NIS is synthesized in the absence of TSH, cells that had been deprived of TSH for 5 days were metabolically labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased for 8 h. NIS immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that de novo biosynthesis of NIS occurred only when cells were maintained in the presence of TSH (Fig.2). NIS remained detectable for up to 10 days following TSH deprivation (Fig. 1 B), i.e. in the absence of de novo NIS biosynthesis (Fig. 2), demonstrating that I− uptake observed in MV from TSH-deprived cells is mediated by NIS molecules synthesized prior to TSH removal. The observation that NIS remains detectable after prolonged TSH deprivation in the absence ofde novo NIS biosynthesis suggests that NIS has a long half-life. To determine the precise half-life of NIS and whether it is modulated by TSH, cells maintained in the presence of TSH were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 5 min and chased for different times in the presence (Fig.3 A) or absence of TSH (Fig.3 B). As indicated above, NIS migrates as an ∼85-kDa broad band. The ∼70-kDa band corresponds to a nonspecific unrelated polypeptide that, unlike NIS, was also immunoprecipitated by preimmune serum (not shown). The half-life of NIS was determined to be ∼5 days in the presence and ∼3 days in the absence of TSH (Fig.3 C). This indicates that TSH modulates the long half-life of NIS, increasing it by 40%. To assess the effect of TSH on NIS content at the plasma membrane, we performed cell surface biotinylation experiments in the presence of TSH and then over the course of 10 days after TSH was removed from the culture medium. To ensure that only polypeptides facing the extracellular milieu would be biotinylated, we utilized the NH2-specific and plasma membrane-impermeable biotinylating reagent Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. The entire biotinylated fraction was isolated with streptavidin-coated beads and was immunoblotted with anti-NIS Ab, whereas only 1:50 of the non-biotinylated fraction was loaded onto the gel (Fig. 4, A andB, respectively). Densitometric quantitation of the bands showed that NIS content at the plasma membrane decreased over time after TSH withdrawal in a fashion that correlated very closely with the corresponding decrease in NIS activity in intact cells (Fig.4 C). While 1 day of TSH deprivation causes a similar decrease in both intracellular and cell surface NIS, by 3 days after TSH withdrawal a more pronounced decrease in NIS content was detected at the plasma membrane than in intracellular compartments (Fig.4 C). This indicates that TSH regulates the subcellular distribution of NIS. The possible regulatory role played by TSH in the subcellular distribution of NIS was further investigated by confocal immunofluorescence analysis of NIS subcellular localization in response to TSH withdrawal over a 10-day period (Fig.5). As anti-NIS Ab recognizes a cytosol-facing epitope of NIS (i.e. the carboxyl terminus), cells were fixed and permeabilized prior to incubation with the Ab. Given that NIS expression decreases after TSH deprivation, images were taken with different exposure times. In the presence of TSH, FRTL-5 cells predominantly displayed a stark immunofluorescent staining delineating the periphery of the cells, strongly indicative of plasma membrane localization for NIS (Fig. 5, 0 days). Some intracellular staining was also observed. The cell surface staining pattern decreased slowly after removal of TSH, disappearing completely by day 3, at which point only an intracellular pattern remained. The intracellular NIS pattern observed on day 3 was punctate and spread throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, by days 5–10 the NIS punctate distribution decreased noticeably and was localized further from the perinuclear region. Immunofluorescence was abolished by preincubation of the Ab with antigen peptide or when the second but not the first Ab was added, indicating that the observed staining is specific for NIS (12Levy O. Dai G. Riedel C. Ginter C.S. Paul E.M. Lebowitz A.N. Carrasco N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5568-5573Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the biotinylation findings described above (Fig. 4), suggesting that TSH is required for NIS localization at the cell surface. Therefore, the absence of TSH over time causes NIS to mainly redistribute to and/or remain in intracellular compartments. These data support the notion that in addition to regulating NIS expression, TSH also regulates the subcellular distribution of NIS. In the absence of TSH, not only isde novo NIS biosynthesis nonexistent (Fig. 2) but NIS is increasingly re-distributed from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments over time (within the 3–7-day range). The mechanism by which TSH regulates the subcellular distribution of NIS is unknown. Phosphorylation has been shown to be implicated in activation and subcellular distribution of several transporters (27Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D.

NIS has several consensus sites for kinases, including those for cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and CK-2. Furthermore, TSH actions in the thyroid are mainly mediated by cAMP, raising the possibility that phosphorylation might be involved in the regulation of NIS distribution. FRTL-5 cells were labeled with32Pi for 5 h and lysed. NIS was immunoprecipitated with anti-NIS Ab, and the immunoprecipitate was subjected to electrophoresis. The autoradiogram revealed that NIS was phosphorylated, independently of the presence of TSH in the culture medium (Fig. 6 A). Given the decreased expression of NIS in TSH-deprived cells, the amount of32P-NIS was considerably lower in these cells than in those grown in the presence of the hormone. To assess whether NIS phosphorylation is modulated by TSH, we performed32Pi labeling in the presence or absence of TSH, and immunoprecipitated 32P-labeled N"

HB-EGF shedding involves proteolytic cleavage of a membrane-anchored precursor by incompletely characterized matrix metalloproteases. In COS-7 cells, α2A-adrenergic receptors (ARs) stimulate ERK phosphorylation via two distinct pathways, a transactivation pathway that involves the release of HB-EGF and the EGFR and an alternate pathway that is independent of both HB-EGF and the EGFR. We have developed a mixed culture system to study the mechanism of GPCR-mediated HB-EGF shedding in COS-7 cells. In this system, α2AAR expressing “donor” cells are co-cultured with “acceptor” cells lacking the α2AAR. Each population expresses a uniquely epitope-tagged ERK2 protein, allowing the selective measurement of ERK activation in the donor and acceptor cells. Stimulation with the α2AR selective agonist UK14304 rapidly increases ERK2 phosphorylation in both the donor and the acceptor cells. The acceptor cell response is sensitive to inhibitors of both the EGFR and HB-EGF, indicating that it results from the release of HB-EGF from the α2AAR-expressing donor cells. Experiments with various chemical inhibitors and dominant inhibitory mutants demonstrate that EGFR-dependent activation of the ERK cascade after α2AAR stimulation requires Gβγ subunits upstream and dynamin-dependent endocytosis downstream of HB-EGF shedding and EGFR activation, whereas Src kinase activity is required both for the release of HB-EGF and for HB-EGF-mediated ERK2 phosphorylation. “Transactivation” of epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) in response to activation of many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involves autocrine/paracrine shedding of heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF).

G protein-coupled receptor epidermal growth factor receptor hemagglutinin mitogen-activated protein c-Src kinase green fluorescent protein heparin-binding EGF extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase receptor tyrosine kinase G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 can employ multiple distinct pathways to activate the ERK/MAPK cascade. At least one of these pathways, demonstrated for both Gi- and Gq-coupled receptors, involves transactivation of classical receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (1Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 2Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A.

A characteristic feature of transactivation-dependent ERK activation is that stimulation of the GPCR leads to activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the RTK. Whereas the early steps leading from GPCR activation to tyrosine phosphorylation of the RTK have remained largely unknown, once transactivation of the RTK has occurred, RTK- and GPCR-mediated ERK activation are indistinguishable. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR leads to the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of adapter proteins such as SHC and Gab1 and the recruitment Grb2-Sos1 complexes to the activated RTK. The Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos1, catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on the low molecular weight G protein, Ras. Ras activation, in turn, initiates the phosphorylation cascade consisting of Raf, MEK, and ERK. Recently, Prenzel et al.(4) have demonstrated that GPCR-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR involves release of a soluble EGFR ligand, heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF). HB-EGF is a single transmembrane-spanning protein that is proteolytically cleaved at a juxtamembrane site leading to the “shedding” of a soluble EGFR ligand that activates the EGFR in an autocrine/paracrine manner (5Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F179-99PubMed Google Scholar). GPCR-mediated HB-EGF release and EGFR transactivation are inhibited by CRM197 (4Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar), a non-toxic diphtheria toxin mutant, which selectively binds and inactivates HB-EGF (6Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). HB-EGF shedding is also sensitive to the non-selective metalloprotease inhibitor, batimistat, indicating that one or more, as yet unknown, matrix metalloproteases function as novel effectors of GPCR signaling (4Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Little is presently known about how GPCRs control metalloprotease activity to induce regulated HB-EGF shedding. In this study, we have developed a mixed culture system to study the mechanism by which α2A-adrenergic receptors (ARs) control HB-EGF shedding in COS-7 cells. In our model system, the release of HB-EGF from donor cells expressing α2AARs is detected by measuring the response in acceptor cells lacking the GPCR. This permits signaling events upstream of HB-EGF shedding to be physically dissociated from those involved in the downstream response to endogenously generated paracrine signals. By selectively introducing dominant negative mutants of putative intermediate proteins into either the donor or acceptor cell pool, we have been able to determine their involvement in either the release of, or response to, HB-EGF. We find that α2AAR-mediated shedding of HB-EGF requires both the release of Gβγ subunits and Src kinase activity, while the response to HB-EGF is dependent upon the EGFR, Src kinases, and clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml gentamicin in a humified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells was carried out at 70–80% confluency on the day of transfection. Cells in 10-cm plates were transfected with a total of 5–10 μg of DNA using a 1:6 ratio (w/v) of LipofectAMINE per dish following the manufacturer's instructions. One day following transfections, the cells were trypsinized and transferred to six-well dishes as described. Transfected cells were serum-starved overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES and 0.1% bovine serum albumin prior to stimulation. Serum-starved transfected cells in six-well dishes were pretreated with the appropriate concentrations of inhibitors as indicated in the figure legends. Additionally, all cells were pretreated with the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, propranolol (1 μm), to block the activation of endogenous β receptors in COS-7 cells. Cells were exposed to agonist at 37 °C for the times indicated in the figure legends, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 300 μl of glycerol lysis buffer (5 mmHEPES, 250 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm NaV04, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), and clarified by centrifugation. Before immunoprecipitation, 50 μl of the cell lysate was transferred to a separate tube and an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added to provide samples for the determination of GFP-ERK2 phosphorylation and plasmid expression. HA-ERK2 was immunoprecipitated using 20 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-HA affinity beads that had been mixed with an equal volume of CL4B-Sepharose and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were washed twice with cold glycerol lysis buffer and denatured in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by protein electrophoresis on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Biosystems). Phospho-ERK1/2 was detected using a 1:3000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal phospho-ERK1/2 specific antibody (New England Biolabs), and total ERK1/2 was detected using a 1:2000 dilution of an ERK1/2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Blots were probed with a 1:5000 dilution of a donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were visualized using Supersignal chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce), and the autoradiographs were quantitated using a Fluor-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad). Fig.1 A schematically depicts the mixed culture system employed to dissociate transactivation-dependent ERK activation from EGFR-independent ERK activation after α2AAR stimulation. Two populations of COS-7 cells were prepared by transient transfection. Donor cells expressed the α2AAR, a receptor that is not endogenously expressed in COS-7 cells, along with HA epitope-tagged ERK2 (HA-ERK2), to allow ERK phosphorylation in the receptor-expressing population to be independently assayed. Acceptor cells in which the α2AAR was not introduced were transfected with green fluorescent protein-tagged ERK2 (GFP-ERK2) to uniquely identify the ERK pool in those cells. Following transfection, the transfected cell populations were mixed and plated at high density using a ratio of donor/acceptor cells of 1:1.5. Following agonist stimulation, cell lysates were prepared, and anti-HA immunoprecipitation and subsequent immunoblotting were used to isolate the HA-ERK2 expressed in the donor cells. GFP-ERK2 phosphorylation in the acceptor cell pool was determined by immunoblotting of the whole cell lysates, since GFP-ERK2 could be resolved from the endogenous ERK pool based upon its slower electrophoretic mobility. This system permitted the simultaneous monitoring of ERK activation in the two separate populations of cells from the same dish. As shown in Fig. 1 B, stimulation of co-cultures with the selective α2AR agonist UK14304 leads to a time-dependent increase in phospho-ERK2 immunoreactivity both in donor cells and in acceptor cells. The time course of ERK2 phosphorylation was similar in both populations, with maximal activation occurring within 5 min of agonist application. The acceptor cell response was more transient, however, with ERK2 phosphorylation returning to near basal levels within 30 min, whereas ERK2 phosphorylation was maintained in the donor cells for at least 2 h. Control experiments (not shown) demonstrated that UK14304 failed to induce ERK2 phosphorylation in COS-7 cells in the absence of transfected α2AAR and that responses in the acceptor cells were only seen when the cells were cultured at high density. These data are consistent with a paracrine response in the acceptor cells that is mediated in response to the release of a soluble factor from the donor cells. To determine the role of endogenous EGFRs in α2AAR-mediated ERK2 activation, we examined the extent to which ERK activation in both donor and acceptor cells was sensitive to inhibitors of HB-EGF shedding and of EGFR signaling. Fig.2 shows the results of experiments in which co-cultures were pretreated with either tyrphostin AG1478, a specific inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase (7Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar), or with CRM197, a non-toxic diphtheria toxin analog that selectively binds to the EGF-like domain of HB-EGF (6Mitamura T. Higashiyama S. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1015-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In the α2AAR-expressing donor cells, maximally efficacious concentrations of CRM197 and tyrphostin AG1478 each inhibited only about 30% of UK14304-stimulated ERK activation (black bars). In contrast, the acceptor cell response in the same co-culture was almost completely blocked by either inhibitor (white bars). Whereas the α2AAR-stimulated ERK response in the donor cells was only partially sensitive to tyrphostin AG1478, comparable EGF-stimulated ERK activated was essentially completely inhibited by tyrphostin AG1478 (data not shown). These data suggest that α2AARs can employ at least two mechanisms to stimulate ERK2 phosphorylation in COS-7 cells, a direct pathway that is independent of HB-EGF shedding and the EGFR, and a transactivation-dependent pathway that requires both HB-EGF shedding and EGFR activation. In cells expressing the α2AAR, the EGFR-independent pathway predominates. Pretreating cells with CRM197 and tyrphostin AG1478 in combination did not result in any further reduction in the donor cell response, indicating that HB-EGF shedding can account for all of the transactivation-dependent ERK activation in both donor and acceptor cells (data not shown). In HB-EGF expressing CHO-K1 cells, shedding of HB-EGF in response to phorbol esters is sensitive to the MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (8Gechtman Z. Alonso J.L. Raab G. Ingber D.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28828-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Similarly, in neutrophils,N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)-stimulatedl-selectin shedding is blocked by inhibitors of ERK or p38 MAP kinase signaling (9Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that MAP kinase activation may be required to initiate metalloprotease-dependent shedding. In contrast, EGFR activation in response to Gi- and Gq/11-coupled receptor activation in fibroblasts is insensitive to PKC inhibitors (4Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). To test whether in our system, ERK activity is required for α2AAR-stimulated HB-EGF shedding, we transiently transfected the dominant inhibitory MEK1 inhibitor, K97A MEK1, into the donor cells and measured ERK activation in both the donor and the acceptor cells. As shown in Fig.3, expression of K97A MEK1 in donor cells markedly attenuated ERK2 activation in the donor cell pool but had no effect on ERK2 activation in the acceptor cells. These data support the hypothesis that the EGFR-independent and HB-EGF-dependent pathways of ERK2 activation employed by α2AAR are mechanistically independent. Tyrphostin AG1478 and CRM197 treatment blocks HB-EGF-mediated ERK activation in acceptor cells while not affecting the transactivation-independent component of the donor cell response (Fig. 2). Conversely, expression of K97A MEK1 in donor cells blocks the donor, but not the acceptor, cell response, indicating that ERK2 activation in the donor cells is not required for HB-EGF shedding (Fig. 3). In the co-culture system, α2AAR-mediated ERK activation in acceptor cells reflects the release of HB-EGF from the donor cell pool. For ERK activation to occur in acceptor cells, signaling events leading to the release of HB-EGF must occur in donor cells, whereas events involved in the response to HB-EGF must occur in the acceptor cells. Thus, by introducing dominant inhibitory mutants of putative intermediate proteins selectively into either donor or acceptor cells, intermediates upstream and/or downstream of HB-EGF shedding and EGFR activation can be unambiguously identified. To determine the role of heterotrimeric G protein subunits in α2AAR-mediated EGFR transactivation, we assayed the effects of pertussis toxin and the Gβγ subunit sequestrant polypeptide βARKCT on the ability of acceptor cells to respond to α2AAR stimulation. As shown in Fig.4, both pertussis toxin pretreatment and expression of the βARKCT peptide in donor cells inhibited ERK activation in both the donor cell and acceptor cell populations. Expression of βARKCT in acceptor cells had no effect upon α2AAR-mediated ERK2 phosphorylation in either the donor or acceptor cells (not shown). These data indicate that consistent with prior reports (3Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), Gβγ subunits derived from pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o proteins are necessary for α2AAR-mediated transactivation of the EGFR. Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are also known to play a role in GPCR-mediated ERK activation via transactivated EGFR (2Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 3Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Uncertainty remains, however, as to whether these kinases are involved in regulating the release of HB-EGF or in the downstream response of the transactivated EGFR. As shown in Fig.5 A, treatment of co-cultures with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 inhibits α2AAR-mediated ERK2 phosphorylation in both donor and acceptor cells. To distinguish between the potential roles of Src kinases upstream or downstream of HB-EGF shedding, two different expressible Src inhibitors were selectively transfected into either the donor or the acceptor cells. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the dominant inhibitory mutant K298M c-Src, when expressed in donor cells, significantly inhibited α2AAR-stimulated ERK activation in both the donor and in the acceptor cells. When K298M c-Src is expressed in acceptor cells, α2AAR-stimulated ERK activation in the acceptor cells is attenuated, whereas ERK activation in the donor cells is unaffected. As shown in Fig. 5 C, comparable results were obtained when donor and acceptor cells were transfected with the physiological c-Src inhibitor, CSK, which inhibits c-Src activity by phosphorylating the regulatory carboxyl-terminal tyrosine of Src family kinases (11Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Science. 1990; 248: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with a role for Src kinase activity in both the direct and EGFR transactivation-dependent pathways. Moreover, in the transactivation pathway, c-Src is required both for α2AAR-mediated HB-EGF shedding and for HB-EGF-dependent ERK activation via the transactivated EGFR, because inhibiting Src kinase activity in either the donor cell or the acceptor cell blocks the acceptor cell response. In HeLa cells, the ability of EGFR to mediate activation of the ERK cascade has previously been shown to involve clathrin-mediated endocytosis (12Vieira A.V. Lamaze C. Schmid S.L. Science. 1996; 274: 2086-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Unlike many GPCRs, the α2AAR does not undergo agonist-induced internalization (13Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, in α2A-expressing COS-7 cells, UK14304 stimulation causes both EGFR internalization and ERK2 activation that is sensitive to inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (14Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Thus, we have previously proposed that inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis inhibit ERK activation not at the level of the GPCR itself but rather downstream of the EGFR (14Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis definitively, a dominant inhibitory form of dynamin I (K44A dynamin I) was expressed in either donor or acceptor cells, and the effect on ERK2 phosphorylation in the acceptor cells was measured. As shown in Fig.6, K44A dynamin I expression in donor cells did not affect ERK activation in acceptor cells, whereas transfecting K44A dynamin I into the acceptor cells attenuated the α2AAR-stimulated ERK activation. These data not only dissociate the early steps of α2AAR activation from the requirement for clathrin-mediated endocytosis but also demonstrate that in the transactivation pathway dynamin-dependent endocytosis is required downstream of the EGFR. With the system developed in these experiments, the transactivation pathway to ERK activation can be isolated from other pathways of ERK activation and intermediate steps localized as either upstream or downstream of HB-EGF shedding and the EGFR. Fig.7 depicts a model of α2AAR-stimulated ERK activation that is consistent with our data. In response to α2AAR stimulation, ERK activation proceeds simultaneously via both a direct pathway and a transactivation-dependent pathway. The initial steps of both pathways are indistinguishable and involve both Gβγ subunits released from pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and Src kinase activity. Following c-Src activation, the direct and the transactivation pathways diverge. The direct pathway leads to MEK activation and ERK phosphorylation that is independent of EGFR kinase activity. In the transactivation pathway, Src kinase activity is required for the induction of HB-EGF shedding, which is mediated by one or more as yet unidentified matrix metalloproteases. Consistent with previous reports (2Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 3Luttrell L.M.

Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), both c-Src activity and dynamin-dependent endocytosis are required downstream of the transactivated EGFR. Thus, Src kinases are apparently involved both upstream of HB-EGF shedding and downstream of the EGFR in the pathway of transactivation-dependent ERK activation. To date, the mechanisms underlying Gβγ activation of Src kinases in response to α2AAR stimulation remain unknown. In the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor (15Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar), the CXCR1 receptor (16Barlic J. Andrews J. Kelvin A. Bosinger S. DeVries M. Xu L. Dobransky T. Feldman R. Ferguson S. Kelvin D. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and the NK-1 receptor (17DeFea K.A. Vaughn Z.D. O'Bryan E.M. Nishijima D. Dery O. Bunnett N.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11086-11091Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), the binding of Src family kinases to β-arrestin results in recruitment of an activated tyrosine kinase to the GPCR following agonist stimulation. Other mechanisms of GPCR-mediated Src activation must exist, however. For example the β3-adrenergic receptor, which does not interact with β-arrestins, recruits Src kinase via a direct interaction between the kinase and intracellular domains of the receptor (18Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Like the β3-adrenergic receptor, α2AARs do not undergo clathrin-mediated endocytosis (14Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar,18Cao W. Luttrell L.M. Medvedev A.V. Pierce K.L. Daniel K.W. Dixon T.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Collins S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38131-38134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and the mechanism for α2AAR-stimulated c-Src activation remains enigmatic. Previously, HB-EGF shedding has been shown to be downstream of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated ERK activation (8Gechtman Z. Alonso J.L. Raab G. Ingber D.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28828-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 9Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in our system, expression of K97A MEK1 in donor cells almost completely abolished ERK activation in the donor cells without affecting ERK activation in the acceptor cells. Although a role for ERK activation in α2AAR-stimulated HB-EGF shedding cannot be entirely ruled out, our data strongly suggest that the direct and transactivation pathways diverge downstream of c-Src but upstream of MEK activation and that ERK activation probably does not contribute to α2AAR-stimulated HB-EGF shedding in COS-7 cells. An attractive hypothesis is that c-Src in the donor cells is a proximal regulator of the unknown metalloprotease responsible for HB-EGF shedding. Several metalloproteases of the ADAM family, which have been shown to regulate shedding of other EGFR ligands, including transforming growth factor α, have proline-rich Src-homology (SH3) binding domains in their cytoplasmic tails. Src family members are known to bind many of their substrates via SH3 domain interactions. Recently, activation of a c-Src family kinase was shown to regulate the ADAM-dependent shedding of the L1 adhesion molecule (19Gutwein P. Oleszewski M. Mechtersheimer S. Agmon-Levin N. Krauss K. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15490-15497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In this case, L1 adhesion molecule shedding is regulated by two distinct pathways, a protein kinase C-dependent pathway that is ERK-dependent and a pervanadate pathway that is dependent on c-Src activation but independent of ERK activation. L1 shedding, then, may be analogous to HB-EGF shedding in which there are at least two pathways, an ERK-dependent pathway downstream of PKC activation and an ERK-independent pathway that involves c-Src activation. In the case of the α2AAR, it is not ERK activation but rather activation of c-Src that is the major pathway contributing to HB-EGF shedding. Potentially, then, the metalloprotease responsible for GPCR-stimulated HB-EGF shedding may contain proline-rich SH3 binding domains. Previous reports have implicated Src kinase activity in the cellular response to transactivated EGFRs. Activation of c-Src downstream of the EGFR may be involved in regulating catalytic activity of the EGFR and/or regulating dynamin-dependent endocytosis of the EGFR or a downstream intermediate. c-Src has been shown to phosphorylate two residues on the EGFR that increase the catalytic activity of the EGFR and regulate EGF-stimulated mitogenesis (20Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). GPCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the adapter proteins Shc and Gab1 (2Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 3Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) requires the activity of both the EGFR and Src kinases. c-Src may also regulate internalization of the EGFR by phosphorylating two components of the clathrin-dependent endocytosis system, clathrin and dynamin. Mutations of two tyrosines in dynamin that are phosphorylated by c-Src diminish EGFR internalization and ERK activation (21Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Similarly, blocking EGF-stimulated c-Src-dependent phosphorylation of clathrin also inhibits EGFR internalization (22Wilde A. Beattie E.C. Lem L. Riethof D.A. Liu S.H. Mobley W.C. Soriano P. Brodsky F.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). This model of transactivation-dependent ERK activation clearly dissociates endocytosis of the GPCR from the requirement for dynamin-dependent endocytosis in transactivation-dependent ERK activation. Our data demonstrate that all of the early steps in transactivation-mediated ERK activation up to and including activation of the metalloprotease are independent of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In the acceptor cells, dynamin-dependent endocytosis is required either at or downstream of EGFR phosphorylation. Previous studies have demonstrated that, in the case of the β2-adrenergic receptor, all of the steps leading up to and including Raf activation were intact in cells expressing a dominant inhibitory form of dynamin (23Kranenburg O. Verlaan I. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35301-35304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Raf-MEK interface is the step regulated by dynamin-dependent endocytosis. While helping to clarify the mechanisms whereby GPCRs mediate activation of the ERK cascade, our data do not provide insight into the functional significance of the direct and transactivation-dependent pathways. Why should such seeming redundancy exist? One possibility is that the consequences of ERK activation are determined to a significant degree by the mechanism by which they are activated. Activation of the ERK cascade via different pathways may provide a mechanism for regulating either the time course or spatial distribution of ERK activity, resulting in distinctly different consequences for the cell. Some evidence for this is provided by the finding that wild-type PAR-2 receptors, which cause β-arrestin-dependent activation of a cytosolic pool of ERK1/2, do not mediate mitogenic responses in KNRK cells. In contrast, mutant PAR-2 receptors that cannot bind β-arrestin, but still activate ERK1/2 through a calcium-dependent pathway, stimulate nuclear translocation of the ERK and provoke a proliferative response (25DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Further experimentation with the system presented here should provide insight into the relevance of GPCR-mediated ERK activation in a host of physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

We used a conditional system that allows probing of heterochromatin at a reporter GFP gene by altering GAL4 transcription factor levels during Drosophila eye development. Surprisingly, the frequency of gene silencing is exquisitely sensitive to GAL4 levels, as though binding site occupancy affects the silenced state. The silent state is plastic, as spontaneous derepression occasionally occurs in both mitotically active and differentiating cells. By simultaneously assaying expression of a nearby gene, we further show that the size of an activated region within heterochromatin is small.

Differential steps of tumor-induced angiogenesis were studied by a novel in vitro confrontation culture of avascular multicellular prostate tumor spheroids and embryoid bodies grown from pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells. Vascularization in embryoid bodies started on day 5 of cell culture and was paralleled by down-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In parallel, a dissipation of gradients in the pericellular oxygen pressure was observed as measured by O(2)-sensitive microelectrodes. After 24--48 h of confrontation culture, cells positive for platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM-1) became visible in the contact region between the embryoid body and the tumor spheroid and sprouted within the confrontation cultures during subsequent days. Tumor-induced angiogenesis resulted in growth stimulation of tumor spheroids, disappearance of central necrosis and a reduction of the pericellular oxygen pressure. Furthermore, tumor vascularization resulted in elevated levels of HIF-1 alpha, VEGF, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), and P-glycoprotein. Tumor-induced angiogenesis may augment the oxygen consumption in tumors resulting in an increased expression of hypoxia-related, proangiogenic genes as well as of HSP27 and P-glycoprotein, which are involved in a multidrug resistance phenotype."

The use of radiolabeledl-[35S]cysteine has demonstrated that both sulfurs of the dithiolene group of MPT originate froml-cysteine. It was found that MPT can be produced from precursor Z in an E. coli iscS mutant strain, indicating that IscS is not required for the in vivo sulfuration of MPT synthase. A comparison of the ability of the three sulfurtransferases to provide the sulfur for MPT formation showed the highest activity for CSD in the in vitro system. molybdenum cofactor molybdopterin high performance liquid chromatography carboxamidomethyl-MPT cysteine sulfinate desulfinase In all molybdoenzymes with the exception of nitrogenase, molybdenum is coordinated by the sulfur atoms of the dithiolene group present in the molybdenum cofactor (Moco)1 (1Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10199-10202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biosynthetic pathway for Moco is evolutionary conserved, since genes encoding highly homologous proteins involved in the pathway have been found in archaea, bacteria, higher plants, Drosophila, and higher animals including humans. The reactions of the Moco biosynthetic pathway comprise three stages, which are similar in all organisms utilizing molybdoenzymes. In the first step, a guanine nucleotide is converted into the metastable precursor Z. In the second step, the dithiolene moiety is inserted into precursor Z, converting it to molybdopterin (MPT) (Fig. 1). In the last step of Moco biosynthesis, molybdenum is incorporated into MPT to form Moco. Additional modification of Moco occurs in bacteria with the attachment of GMP, AMP, IMP, or CMP to the phosphate group of MPT. Conversion of precursor Z to MPT requires the opening of a cyclic phosphate to produce a terminal phosphate monoester as well as the transfer of sulfur to generate the dithiolene group essential for molybdenum ligation (2Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction is catalyzed by MPT synthase, a tetrameric protein composed of two small MoaD subunits (8.8 kDa) and two large MoaE subunits (16.8 kDa). The recently solved high resolution crystal structure of E. coli MPT synthase has shown that the C terminus of each small subunit is inserted into one of the large subunits to form the active site (3Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The small subunit of MPT synthase shows high structural similarity to the eukaryotic protein ubiquitin. In the activated form of MPT synthase, the C terminus of the small subunit is converted to a glycine thiocarboxylate that acts as the sulfur donor for the conversion of precursor Z to MPT (2Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Rudolph M.J. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Mass spectroscopy has identified that MPT synthase in its inactive form is lacking the thiocarboxylate at the C-terminal glycine of MoaD (2Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the inactive form of MPT synthase could be purified frommoeB mutant strains (2Pitterle D.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13499-13505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the MoeB protein is in fact MPT synthase sulfurase responsible for regenerating the active sulfur at the C-terminal glycine-carboxylate of the small subunit of the synthase. This reaction has been shown to be ATP-dependent (4Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); however, details of the mechanism of action of the sulfurase, including the identity of the sulfur donor for the protein, remains as yet unknown. This paper describes an in vitro system for the activation of inactive MPT synthase isolated from a moeB mutant strain. This activation was monitored by conversion of precursor Z to MPTin vitro. The data strongly suggest thatl-cysteine is the likely physiological sulfur donor for the dithiolene group of MPT and demonstrate that an additional protein component is required for the transfer of sulfur froml-cysteine to MPT synthase. It is known that NifS, a well characterized pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzyme from Azotobacter vinelandii, is involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation for nitrogenase, converting l-cysteine to l-alanine and elemental sulfur (5Zheng L. Dean D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, three NifS-like proteins resembling A. vinelandii NifS in amino acid sequence and catalytic properties have been identified (6Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol.

These proteins, designated IscS, CSD, and CsdB, are described as pyridoxal 5′-phosphate-dependent enzymes that catalyze the elimination of selenium and sulfur from l-selenocysteine and l-cysteine, respectively, to form l-alanine (9Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Esaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 127: 559-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). IscS is a cysteine desulfurase and is proposed to play a general role in the formation of iron-sulfur clusters and additionally is required for the biosynthesis of 4-thiouridine, thiamin and NAD (6Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Schwartz C.J. Djaman O. Imlay J.A. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20096-20103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In contrast, CSD, encoded by csdA, has been shown to act on l-selenocysteine, l-cysteine, andl-cysteine sulfinate and is named cysteine sulfinate desulfinase (7Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22417-22424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). CsdB shows much higher activity towardl-selenocysteine than l-cysteine and is thus similar to selenocysteine lyase in this respect (8Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T. Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The exact physiological functions of these enzymes remain to be elucidated. We have cloned and purified all three NifS-like proteins from E. coli and demonstrated that in an in vitro system, all three proteins can transfer sulfur from l-cysteine for the activation of inactive MPT synthase in an ATP-dependent reaction, with CSD being the most effective of the three. -E. coli strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI.

Human sulfite oxidase was cloned into a pTrc-His vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), generating an N-terminal fusion to a His6 tag, expressed inE. coli moaA −, MC1061, and CL100(iscS −) cells, and purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (13Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments containing iscS,csdA, and csdB were cloned from chromosomalE. coli DNA by polymerase chain reaction. Oligonucleotide primers used were as follows. 1) 5′-CCATGGAATTACCGATTTATCTCGACTAC-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTTAATGATGAGCCCATTCGATGCTGTTC-3′ were used for cloning iscS into the NcoI and BamHI sites of pET15b. During cloning, the second amino acid of IscS was changed from a lysine to a glutamate. The resulting plasmid was designated pSL209. 2) Primers 5′-CGGTGCATCAAGCCGAGGAGTCATATGAACG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTTAATCCACCAATAATTCCAGCGCG-3′ were used for cloningcsdA into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET15b.

The resulting plasmid was designated pSL213. The corresponding restriction sites used for cloning are underlined. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the corresponding expression plasmids were grown in 2 liters of LB medium to anA600 of 0.6. At this point, protein expression was induced by the addition of 100 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. After 4 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g. The His6 tag-containing CsdB and CSD were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. The cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and lysed by several passages through a French pressure cell. After centrifugation at 17,000 ×g for 25 min, imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10 mm. The supernatant was then combined with 1.5 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) per liter of cell growth, and the slurry was equilibrated with gentle stirring at 4 °C for 30 min. The slurry was poured into a column and washed with 2 column volumes of 10 mm imidazole, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, followed by a wash with 10 column volumes of the same buffer with 20 mm imidazole. The His-tagged proteins were eluted with 100 mm imidazole in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing CsdB or CSD were combined and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.5. For the purification of IscS, the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and lysed by several passages through a French pressure cell. After centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 25 min, nucleic acids were removed by streptomycin sulfate addition, and IscS was precipitated with 45% ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation, the protein was resolubilized and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. The dialyzed sample was applied to a 25-ml Q-Sepharose FPLC column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and IscS was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl. The pool of fractions containing IscS was concentrated to 1 ml and chromatographed on a Superose 12 FPLC column equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm Tris, 1 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. The yield of all three proteins was ∼20 mg/liter of E. coli culture. Sulfite oxidase activity was assayed at room temperature by monitoring the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm (14Jones H.P. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4988-4993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using a Shimadzu 1601 spectrophotometer. One unit of sulfite oxidase activity is defined as an absorbance change (ΔA) of 1 per min. Nitrate reductase activity was assayed in extracts at room temperature with benzyl viologen as electron donor after the method described in Ref. 15Jones R.W. Garland P.B. Biochem. J. 1977; 164: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar. One unit of nitrate reductase activity is described as the production of 1 μmol of nitrate/min/mg of protein. For the in vitro formation of MPT, 150–200 μmprecursor Z (in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer adjusted to pH 7.2); 175 nm to 78 μm inactive MPT synthase; 3.5–31 μm MoeB; 2.5 mm MgCl2; 2.5 mm ATP; 4 nm to 5 μm IscS, CSD, or CsdB; and 2.5 mml-cysteine were incubated in a total volume of 400 μl of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2. For a standard incubation assay, all reactants were allowed to react at room temperature for 30 min under aerobic conditions. The reaction was stopped by the addition of acidic iodine and analyzed for the production of form A afterward (16Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the generation of a IscS, CSD, or CsdB-bound persulfide, 3 mg of IscS, CSD, or CsdB were incubated with 2 mml-cysteine for 5 min at 4 °C, gel-filtered using a PD10 column equilibrated with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and immediately added to the in vitro activation mixtures. In vitro production of MPT was quantitated by its conversion to the stable, fluorescent degradation product form A. For this conversion, the incubation mixtures were adjusted to pH 2.5, and excess iodine was added as described in Refs. 16Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol.

The amount of form A was then quantitated by HPLC analysis by comparison with a standard sample obtained from purified human sulfite oxidase. For the in vitro insertion of 35S from labeled l-cysteine into precursor Z, incubation mixtures contained 73.8 μm MPT synthase, 31.3 μmMoeB, 5.2 μm IscS, 400 μm precursor Z, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 1 mml-cysteine, 51 μm sulfite oxidase, and 1 μCi of l-[35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 10 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2, with or without the addition of 20 mmNa2MoO4. All components were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of aposulfite oxidase. Following a second 30-min incubation, the mixture was dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. The tagged sulfite oxidase was purified from the mixture after the method described in Temple et al. (13Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Fractions containing sulfite oxidase were pooled and concentrated to 1 ml using a Centriprep 10 filtration device (Amicon) and gel-filtered using a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 100 mm Tris, pH 7.2. To produce form B from the cofactor bound to sulfite oxidase, 75 μl of 1 m HCl was added to 600 μl of sulfite oxidase, prior to incubation for 30 min at 95 °C (16Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was then treated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the resulting dephosphorylated form B was purified by HPLC analysis at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with an Alltech C18 HPLC column equilibrated in 50 mm ammonium acetate, 10% methanol. The concentration of purified form B was determined using an extinction coefficient at 395 nm of 12,900m−1cm−1. For the production of carboxamidomethyl-MPT (camMPT), 1400 μl of sulfite oxidase was incubated anaerobically for 16 h in 17 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 80 mg of iodoacetamide (Sigma), 100 μl of 100 mm sodium dithionite, and 200 mg of SDS (18Johnson J.L. Bastian N.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3190-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). After ultrafiltration using a PM-10 membrane, the effluent was applied to a 1-ml QAE-Sephadex column (Sigma) equilibrated with water. The column was washed with 20 ml of water, followed by 20 ml of 10 mm acetic acid, and camMPT was eluted with 20 ml of 10 mm HCl. Fractions containing camMPT were identified using a Beckman LS 1801 scintillation counter, pooled, neutralized with NH4OH, and concentrated using a SpeedVac system (Savant). Final purification of camMPT was achieved by chromatography on a C18 HPLC column in 50 mm ammonium acetate, 3% methanol. The concentration of camMPT was determined using its extinction coefficient at 367 nm of 7340m−1 cm−1. Radioactivity present in form B and camMPT was measured and compared with a standard curve recorded withl-[35S]cysteine. It has been shown earlier that MPT can be synthesized in vitro by incubation of purified precursor Z with the active form of MPT synthase (17Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Pitterle D.M. Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13506-13509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the transfer of sulfur from MPT synthase to precursor Z, MPT synthase is present in an inactive, desulfurated form lacking the C-terminal thiocarboxylate group at the MoaD subunit of the protein. In order to define the sulfur transfer pathway involved in resulfuration of MPT synthase, thein vitro system was modified to include inactive MPT synthase and purified MoeB protein. MoeB has been proposed to regenerate the active sulfur at the glycine-carboxylate group of MPT synthase in an ATP-dependent reaction and has been designated as MPT synthase sulfurase (4Rajagopalan K.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Precursor Z was purified from a moaD mutant strain unable to convert the precursor to MPT (12Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13493-13498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inactive, recombinant MPT synthase was purified from amoeB mutant strain as described earlier (17Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). MoeB was expressed in cells that contain a mutation in moaDand purified afterward (experimental procedures). The activation of MPT synthase was assayed by the ability of the synthase to convert precursor Z to MPT in vitro. For the production of MPT in vitro, precursor Z, inactive MPT synthase, MoeB, and Mg-ATP were incubated at room temperature as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Acidic iodine treatment converts MPT to its oxidized fluorescent degradation product form A (Fig. 1) (16Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HPLC analysis revealed that no form A was formed under these conditions (Fig.2 A). This finding indicated that MoeB by itself was not able to sulfurate inactive MPT synthasein vitro. In contrast, when a crude cell extract prepared from a moeB mutant strain was included in the in vitro incubation mixture, form A was obtained (Fig.2 B). To identify the component in the crude extract necessary for activation of MPT synthase, the extract was separated into a protein fraction and a low molecular weight fraction by gel filtration and ultrafiltration, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2,C and D, neither the protein fraction nor the low molecular weight fraction alone was able to provide the missing component in the in vitro system. This result led to the conclusion that an as yet unidentified protein component as well as a low molecular weight substance are necessary for the activation of inactive MPT synthase by MoeB, with the low molecular weight substance presumably providing the sulfur source for the sulfuration of the synthase. In order to identify possible physiological sulfur donors, different sulfur sources were added to the in vitro system containing precursor Z, MPT synthase, MoeB, and Mg-ATP and tested for their ability to activate MPT synthase in the presence of the protein fraction of the moeB − crude extract. As shown in Fig. 3, among sulfide, thiosulfate, thiocyanate, l-cystine, and l-cysteine, significant form A formation could only be observed in the presence of sulfide or l-cysteine (Fig. 3, A andE). However, as shown in Fig. 3 F, the formation of form A was also observed when inorganic sulfide was present in the incubation mixture in the absence of the protein fraction ofmoeB− extract. These results indicated that while l-cysteine is the likely physiological sulfur donor for the activation of MPT synthase, inorganic sulfide is able to serve the same function in vitro. Since in the presence ofl-cysteine an additional protein component is required for the sulfur transfer process, it was apparent that an as yet unidentified sulfurtransferase is required for the transfer of sulfur from l-cysteine to MPT synthase in a reaction requiring MoeB as well. With the identification of l-cysteine as the likely physiological sulfur donor for the sulfuration of MPT synthase, it was of further interest to identify the sulfurtransferase required for the mobilization of this sulfur. Since this protein has to act as an l-cysteine desulfurase, it appeared that a NifS-like protein might be involved in this reaction. Three NifS-like proteins have been identified in the E. coli genome sequence, designated IscS, CSD, and CsdB (6Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). While all three enzymes can desulfurate l-cysteine, they displayed different substrate specificities. IscS has the highest activity withl-cysteine, whereas CSD, described as a sulfinate desulfinase, prefers l-cysteine sulfinate as substrate (7Mihara H. Kurihara T. Yoshimura T. Soda K. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22417-22424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). CsdB has a much higher activity with l-selenocysteine thanl-cysteine and is regarded as the E. colicounterpart of mammalian selenocysteine lyase (8Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T. Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To test the relative abilities of the three proteins to utilize sulfur froml-cysteine for the sulfuration of MPT synthase in vitro, IscS, CSD, and CsdB were cloned from the E. coligenome and purified after expression in BL21(DE3) cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The effectiveness of the three enzymes for in vitro MPT production was examined using reaction mixtures containing l-cysteine as a sulfur source, one of the three NifS-like sulfurtransferases, MoeB, inactives MPT synthase, precursor Z, and Mg-ATP. The sulfurtransferase activity was assessed by the amount of MPT produced in vitro by equivalent amounts of the sulfurtransferases. As shown in TableII, the catalytic activities of IscS, CSD, and CsdB varied markedly. The mixture containing CSD produced the highest amount of MPT (34.04 nmol of MPT/nm CSD). IscS produced much less MPT (29.5%) compared with CSD (10.05 nmol of MPT/nm IscS), whereas CsdB showed the lowest activity, with about 1.2% MPT formed compared with CSD (0.40 nmol MPT/nmCsdB). The differences in the activities of the three enzymes in the transfer of sulfur from l-cysteine to activate MPT synthase are in conformity with their specific activities estimated by the production of elemental sulfur from l-cysteine as reported by Mihara et al. (8Mihara H. Maeda M. Fujii T. Kurihara T. Hata Y. Esaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14768-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In sum, these experiments delineate a sulfur transfer pathway from l-cysteine to MPT synthase, which in turn converts precursor Z to MPT in the presence of Mg-ATP. All components described above are essential for the in vitro assembly of MPT, since in the absence of either MoeB, MPT synthase, Mg-ATP, l-cysteine, or a sulfurtransferase no MPT was formed (data not shown).Table IIAbilities of E. coli NifS-like proteins to provide the sulfur for the formation of MPTEnzymeEnzyme activity 2-aEnzyme activity was determined by the amount of form A produced in in vitroactivation assays containing 175 nm MPT synthase, 30.2 μm MoeB, 150 μm precursor Z, 2.5 mm Mg-ATP, and 2.5 mm cysteine.

https://openalex.org/W2091841822,"Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) is a paracrine mediator of epithelial cell growth. To examine the direct effects of KGF on the morphogenesis of the epidermis, we generated skin equivalents in vitro by seeding human keratinocytes on the papillary surface of acellular dermis and raising them up to the air-liquid interface. KGF was either added exogenously or expressed by keratinocytes via a recombinant retrovirus encoding KGF. KGF induced dramatic changes to the 3-dimensional organization of the epidermis including pronounced hyperthickening, crowding, and elongation of the basal cells, flattening of the rete ridges, and a ripple-like pattern in the junction of stratum corneum and granular layers. Quantitative immunostaining for the proliferation antigen, Ki67, revealed that in addition to increasing basal proliferation, KGF extended the proliferative compartment by inducing suprabasal cell proliferation. KGF also induced expression of the integrin alpha 5 beta 1 and delayed expression of keratin 10 and transglutaminase. However, barrier formation of the epidermis was not disrupted. These results demonstrate for the first time that a single growth factor can alter the 3-dimensional organization and proliferative function of an in vitro epidermis. In addition to new strategies for tissue engineering, such a well-defined system will be useful for analyzing growth factor effects on the complex links between cell proliferation, cell movement and differentiation within a stratified tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2139386138,"Tumor growth and metastasis are critically dependent on the formation of new blood vessels. The present study found that extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1), a newly described secretory glycoprotein, promotes angiogenesis. This was initially suggested by in situ hybridization studies of mouse embryos indicating that the ECM1 message was associated with blood vessels and its expression pattern was similar to that of flk-1, a recognized marker for endothelium. More direct evidence for the role of ECM1 in angiogenesis was provided by the fact that highly purified recombinant ECM1 stimulated the proliferation of cultured endothelial cells and promoted blood vessel formation in the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos. Immunohistochemical staining with specific antibodies indicated that ECM1 was expressed by the human breast cancer cell lines MDA-435 and LCC15, both of which are highly tumorigenic. In addition, staining of tissue sections from patients with breast cancer revealed that ECM1 was present in a significant proportion of primary and secondary tumors. Collectively, the results of this study suggest that ECM1 possesses angiogenic properties that may promote tumor progression."

Shiloh Y. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Support for this hypothesis comes from observations that pATM-deficient cells are unusually sensitive to the toxic effects of hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide, and superoxide treatment as determined by colony-forming efficiency assays. Additionally, they resynthesize glutathione unusually slowly after depletion with diethyl maleate (21Vuillaume M. Mutat.

Therefore, we hypothesized that pATM-deficient fibroblasts would lack normal cell cycle checkpoint function in response to oxidative stress. To test this hypothesis, we compared the effect of IR, and reactive oxygen species produced by treatment with t-butyl hydroperoxide, on normal and ATM-deficient human fibroblast strains. NHF1 is a normal human fibroblast culture derived from foreskins of apparently healthy neonates and was used at passages 13–19 (27Boyer J.C. Kaufmann W.K. Brylawski B.P. Cordeiro-Stone M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2593-2598PubMed Google Scholar). GM03349, a normal dermal fibroblast strain from a 10-year-old male, was obtained from NIGMS (National Institutes of Health) Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Camden, NJ) and used at passages 15–19. ATM-deficient dermal fibroblasts were obtained from the NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (strain designations GM02052 and GM03395 (Camden, NJ)) and the NIA Aging Cell Repository (strain AG03058 (Camden, NJ)). The donor for the cells of strain GM02052 was a 15-year-old Moroccan female. Cells of this strain contain a mutation at nucleotide 103 that causes a change in coding from cysteine to thymidine, resulting in a stop codon at position 35 (28). The cells of strain GM03395 are dermal fibroblasts cultured from a skin biopsy of a 13-year-old black male, and the cells of strain AG03058 are dermal fibroblasts cultured from a skin biopsy from a 14-year-old black female. The exact mutations ofATM in strains GM03395 and AG03058 are not known. However, no pATM could be detected by immunoblotting in protein extracts from any of these strains, and the donors expressed the typical phenotype of the AT disease. These cells were used at passages 14–20. Normal human fibroblasts (NHF1 and GM03349 strains) were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in minimum Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 mm glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) (NHF medium).ATM-deficient fibroblasts (GM02052, GM03395, and AG03058) were grown under the same conditions in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.4 mm serine, 0.2 mm aspartic acid, and 2 mm pyruvic acid (AT medium) (14Paules R.S. Levedakou E.N. Wilson S.J. Innes C.L. Rhodes N. Tlsty T.D. Galloway D.A. Donehower L.A. Tainsky M.A. Kaufmann W.K. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1763-1773PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), were cultured as above in minimum Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were tested and found to be mycoplasma free. Logarithmically growing cell populations in 100-mm plastic dishes (Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were exposed to γ-rays at room temperature using a 137Cs source at a rate of 2.6 Gy/min. Mock-treated control cells were subjected to the same movements both in and out of the incubators as treated cells, for both IR andt-butyl hydroperoxide treatments. When cells were treated with t-butyl hydroperoxide, the t-butyl hydroperoxide was added to cell cultures for 15 min. The cultures were then washed 2× with warm media, and the media were replaced. In experiments where some cell cultures were treated witht-butyl hydroperoxide, all plates within the same experiment were washed as described above. After treatment, the cells were incubated for the times indicated and harvested. Logarithmically growing fibroblast populations were harvested by typsinization, counted in a cell counter (Coulter Counter ZM, Coulter Corp., Miami, Fl), and replated at a density of 103 fibroblasts/100-mm tissue culture dish. After allowing cells to adhere for 12 h, the fibroblasts were exposed for 15 min to various concentrations oft-butyl hydroperoxide, washed, and incubated for 8–12 days in appropriate media. For assays employing mannitol, fibroblasts were treated 1 h with 1 mm mannitol, followed by treatment with t-butyl hydroperoxide in the continued presence of 1 mm mannitol, washed, and incubated as described above. Media were removed and colonies fixed by the addition of water/methanol (1:1, v/v) containing crystal violet (1 g/liter) and counted using a dissecting microscope. For each fibroblast strain, a minimum of two colony-forming assay experiments was performed, with each data point done in triplicate. G1 checkpoint function was assayed by flow cytometry using a modification of the cell cycle analysis protocol in Kastan et al. (1Kastan M.B. Onyekere O. Sidransky D. Volgelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar) for simultaneous analysis of DNA synthesis and cell cycle. Logarithmically growing cells were either mock-treated, exposed to 3.0 Gy γ-IR, or exposed to various concentrations oft-butyl hydroperoxide as described above. 4 h following treatment, BrdUrd (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the media to a final concentration of 10 μm, and cells were incubated for an additional 2 h. Cells were harvested, fixed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/methanol at a 1:2 (v/v) ratio, and stored at −20 °C. 5 × 105 cells from each sample were stained for BrdUrd incorporation in a solution of Tween 20/BSA plus anti-BrdUrd antibody (Becton Dickinson catalog number 347580) as recommended by the manufacturer. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) was used as secondary antibody. Cells were stained with PBS containing 5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACSort. Twenty thousand cells were counted for each analysis. Flow cytometric experiments were done twice with each treatment point done in duplicate. After treatment, cells were harvested and solubilized on ice in kinase lysis buffer with inhibitors (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 120 kallikrein IU/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein concentration was determined using a detergent-compatible protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Although the amount of protein used in different kinase assay experiments varied, within each experiment the protein concentrations employed were the same for all samples. In p34CDC2/cyclin B histone H1 in vitrokinase activity assays 50–100 μg of protein was used per kinase reaction, whereas 500–700 μg of protein was used per p33CDK2/cyclin E histone H1 in vitro kinase assay. The desired amount of protein from solubilized extracts was aliquoted into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and volumes were adjusted to 500 μl with kinase lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitations were done with either 0.5 μl of anti-human cyclin B Powerclonal antibody (catalog number 05-373, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or 2.0 μl of anti-human cyclin E Powerclonal antibody (catalog number 05-371, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Samples were precleared with protein G-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.), then incubated with the primary antibody for 2 h, followed by the addition of protein G-agarose beads. Kinase reactions were carried out in histone H1 kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm EGTA, 50 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 60 kallikrein IU/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μmcyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase-inhibitory peptide), with 8 μg of histone H1 and 10 μCi of [32γ-P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 37 °C. The kinase reactions were stopped by addition of 2× SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 150 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue), and proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to verify equal histone protein loading, dried, and subjected to autoradiography with Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The radiolabeled protein substrates in the dried gels were then quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. All kinase assays were performed at least in triplicate. After appropriate treatment, fibroblasts were fixed on 100-mm dishes by the gentle addition of cold methanol. After 10 min the plates were air-dried and stored at 4 °C until staining with 0.2 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). DAPI-stained cells then were examined by fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of mitotic cells (the mitotic index) was determined from counts of a minimum of 5,000 cells. All mitotic delay treatments were performed in duplicate, and all experiments were done in duplicate. Immunoprecipitations of p53 were performed with whole cell extracts from five 100-mm tissue culture dishes (∼800 μg protein/IP) as described above for protein kinase assays, using 2.5 μl of anti-p53 murine monoclonal antibody (catalog number OP03, Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA) per sample. Eluted proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with anti-p53 antibody (a generous gift from Dr. B. Alex Merrick, NIEHS), which had been raised in rabbits against immunopurified human r-p53 expressed in a baculovirus expression system. By using anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), p53 protein was visualized by chemiluminescence (Pierce) followed by exposure to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). p53 immunoprecipitations and Western analysis were performed in triplicate. To examine the effect of t-butyl hydroperoxide on HO-1 protein levels in normal and AT fibroblasts, we treated AT and NHF1 fibroblasts with 1–10 μm t-butyl hydroperoxide for 4 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed as described above; 100 μg of whole cell protein extract was loaded per lane; proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as described above. Nitrocellulose blots were probed with anti-HO-1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (catalog number PA3-019, Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) and visualized using anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described above. All HO-1 induction Western blots were done in triplicate. In order to isolate the highest affinity, highest specificity αATM 7 antibodies from the rabbit polyclonal antiserum, antibody was affinity-purified using the original peptide immunogen. Peptide corresponding to pATM residues 826–840 (ATM-N826 peptide) was immobilized to generate a peptide column in the following manner. Ten mg of ATM-N826 peptide were mixed with 1.0 ml of Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad). The reaction mixture was mixed at room temperature for 2–3 h, and then the organic solvents were replaced with 10% ethanolamine in water for 1 h at room temperature to terminate the reaction and block any unreacted groups that remained. The derivatized Affi-Gel was poured into a column and cleaned by passing 4 m potassium thiocyanate through the packing. The column was washed with PBS and stored in PBS with 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C. To affinity-purify antipeptide antibody, IgG was isolated from the whole polyclonal rabbit serum using an Econo-Pac Protein A kit (Bio-Rad). Twenty five to 30 mg of the protein A-purified IgG was added to the Affi-Gel peptide column and tumbled overnight at 4 °C. The antibody-bound peptide beads were washed with 5 column volumes of 1m potassium thiocyanate, and fractions were eluted with 4m potassium thiocyanate. BSA (0.1%) was added to peak fractions prior to dialysis in 1× PBS overnight at 4 °C. The peak fractions were verified by Western blotting of total protein extracts from normal and ATM-deficient fibroblasts that had been resolved by 6% SDS-PAGE (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 100:1). Affinity-purified αATM 7 (αATM 7 a.p.) antibody was stored in 20% glycerol and 0.02% sodium azide at −20 °C. The pATM in vitro PHAS-1 kinase assays were done as described previously (16Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar,17Canman C.E.

Cells were incubated for 90 min following exposure with 6.0 Gy γ-IR or a 15-min exposure to 300 μm t-butyl hydroperoxide and then lysed in kinase lysis buffer with 10 mm β-glycerophosphate and 1 mmNaVO3 added. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation; the protein concentration was determined; the volume was adjusted to 0.9 ml with kinase lysis buffer plus inhibitors, and protein G-agarose beads were added to pre-clear the lysates as described above. After 30 min, the pre-cleared lysates were removed from the protein G-agarose beads and added to either 0.1 ml of kinase lysis buffer with inhibitors alone or containing αATM 7 a.p. antibody. In order to test antibody specificity, in some treatments the αATM 7 a.p. antibody was incubated for 30 min prior to its addition to the cell lysates with either 25 μg of the peptide that the antibody was raised against (ATM-N826) or with 25 μg of an irrelevant peptide sequence of the same length. All pATM kinase reactions were performed at least in triplicate using 1.5–3.0 mg protein lysate per immunoprecipitation. To quantify the damage induced in NHFs andATM-deficient fibroblasts by t-butyl hydroperoxide and IR, we measured thymine glycol formation in the DNA from ATM-normal NHF1 cells and ATM-deficient AG03058 fibroblasts following treatment by each agent. Six plates of logarithmically growing NHF1 or AG03058 fibroblasts, at ∼70% confluence, were treated with 100 or 300 μm t-butyl hydroperoxide or 6 Gy γ-IR, as described above. Cells were harvested from each plate on ice with 5 ml of cold PBS as soon as possible following treatment. The cells were pelleted, washed 1 time in cold PBS, re-pelleted in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and quick-frozen in dry ice/ethanol until assayed. Determination of thymine glycol formation was performed as described previously (29Le X.C. Xing J.Z. Lee J. Leadon S.A. Weinfeld M. Science. 1998; 280: 1066-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Each experimental point was performed in triplicate. To examine the relative toxicity of reactive oxygen species exposure between normal and pATM-deficient fibroblasts, we treated different fibroblast strains witht-butyl hydroperoxide. We employed t-butyl hydroperoxide as a source of oxidative stress as it is poorly hydrolyzed by catalase (30Winston G.W. Harvey W. Berl L. Cederbaum A.I. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We reasoned that this is important since catalase activity has been reported to be low inATM-deficient cells (31Vuillaume M. Calvayrac R. Best Belpomme M. Tarroux P. Hubert M. Decroix Y. Sarasin A. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 538-544PubMed Google Scholar, 32Watters D. Kedar P. Spring K. Bjorkman J. Chen P. Gatei M. Birrell G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34277-34282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and thus, using a peroxide that can be hydrolyzed by catalase, would introduce experimental variation due to differences in cellular catalase activities. To initiate these studies, two normal and two ATM-deficient fibroblast strains were treated with increasing levels of IR, and toxicity was assayed by colony-forming efficiency. As reported previously (7Shiloh Y. Tabor E. Becker Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 140: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), exposure to increasing amounts of IR inhibited colony formation in ATM-deficient fibroblast strains more effectively than in NHFs (Fig.1 A). To compare the effects oft-butyl hydroperoxide on normal and ATM-deficient fibroblasts, normal NHF1 and GM03349 cells and ATM-deficient GM02052 and GM03395 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of t-butyl hydroperoxide. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the ATM-deficient fibroblasts were more sensitive to the colony-forming inhibiting effects of t-butyl hydroperoxide than the normal fibroblasts. LC50 (lethal concentration for 50% of population) for both normal fibroblast strains was in the 40–50 μm t-butyl hydroperoxide range, whereas the LC50 for the ATM-deficient dermal fibroblast strains was in the 6–8 μm range (Fig. 1 B). The colony-inhibiting effect of t-butyl hydroperoxide in both normal and ATM-deficient fibroblast strains was biphasic, with an initial high sensitivity to low concentrations oft-butyl hydroperoxide (1–10 μm), followed by less sensitivity at higher concentrations (>10 μm). This apparent biphasic response is pATM-independent and suggests to us that higher concentrations of t-butyl hydroperoxide induce a pATM-independent resistance or adaptive response to the effects oft-butyl hydroperoxide in both cell types (Fig.1 B, compare 1–10 μm to 10–300 μm t-butyl hydroperoxide). Peroxides are thought to exert some of their damaging effects through the production of reactive oxygen intermediates via events such as the Fenton reaction (for review see Ref. 33Shackelford R.E. Kaufmann W.K. Paules R.S. Environ. Health Perspect. 1999; 107: 5-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). We pretreated fibroblasts with mannitol for 1 h prior to t-butyl hydroperoxide treatment in order to ascertain if the colony-inhibiting effects oft-butyl hydroperoxide could be reduced by co-treatment with an antioxidant. Mannitol, which is effective at scavenging hydroxyl radicals (34Regoli F. Winston G.W. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 156: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), was used as an antioxidant. As shown in Fig.1 C, pretreatment with mannitol partially inhibited the killing effect of t-butyl hydroperoxide on both normal andATM-deficient fibroblast strains. For most concentrations examined, the differences between treatment with and without mannitol are significant. However, pretreatment with mannitol of theATM-deficient cells showed less reduction of killing following treatment with the highest concentration oft-butyl hydroperoxide (100 μm) (Fig.1 C). This is likely to be due to the very low number ofATM-deficient cells that can still form colonies at this concentration of t-butyl hydroperoxide. Nevertheless, these data show that the toxic effect of t-butyl hydroperoxide can be partially reversed by pretreatment with an antioxidant. G1 checkpoint function, as reflected by delay of entry into S phase, was assayed following exposure to oxidative stress. Exposure of NHF1 fibroblasts in logarithmic growth phase to t-butyl hydroperoxide over a 10–100 μm range resulted in a concentration-dependent suppression of S phase entry, as measured by flow cytometry (Table I and Fig. 2). When theATM-deficient fibroblast strain AG03058 was subjected to the same treatment, comparatively little inhibition of S phase entry was observed over the same concentrations of t-butyl hydroperoxide (Table I and Fig. 2). As demonstrated previously (11Painter R.B. Young B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7315-7317Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar,35Beamish H. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Radiat.

https://openalex.org/W2138515025,"The thyroid hormone (T3) affects cell growth, differentiation, and regulates metabolic functions via its interaction with the thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TRs). The mechanism by which TRs mediate cell growth is unknown. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the mitogenic effect of T3, we have determined changes in activation of transcription factors, mRNA levels of immediate early genes, and levels of proteins involved in the progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle. We show that hepatocyte proliferation induced by a single administration of T3 to Wistar rats occurred in the absence of activation of AP-1, NF-kappa B, and STAT3 or changes in the mRNA levels of the immediate early genes c-fos, c-jun, and c-myc. These genes are considered to be essential for liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH). On the other hand, T3 treatment caused an increase in cyclin D1 mRNA and protein levels that occurred much more rapidly compared to liver regeneration after 2/3 PH. The early increase in cyclin D1 expression was associated with accelerated onset of DNA synthesis, as demonstrated by a 20-fold increase of bromodeoxyuridine-positive hepatocytes at 12 h after T3 treatment and by a 20-fold increase in mitotic activity at 18 h. An early increase of cyclin D1 expression was also observed after treatment with nafenopin, a ligand of a nuclear receptor (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha) of the same superfamily of steroid/thyroid receptors. T3 treatment also resulted in increased expression of cyclin E, E2F, and p107 and enhanced phosphorylation of pRb, the ultimate substrate in the pathway leading to transition from G1 to S phase. The results demonstrate that cyclin D1 induction is one of the earlier events in hepatocyte proliferation induced by T3 and suggest that this cyclin might be a common target responsible for the mitogenic activity of ligands of nuclear receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2071957953,"Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are important effector cells in host defense and the inflammatory response to antigen. The involvement of PMNs in inflammation is mediated mainly by the Fc receptor family, including IgE receptors. Recently, PMNs were shown to express two IgE receptors (CD23/Fc epsilon RII and galectin-3). In allergic diseases, the dominant role of IgE has been mainly ascribed to its high-affinity receptor, Fc epsilon RI. We have examined the expression of Fc epsilon RI by PMNS: mRNA and cell surface expression of Fc epsilon RI alpha chain was identified on PMNs from asthmatic subjects. Furthermore, preincubation with human IgE Fc fragment blocks completely the binding of anti-Fc epsilon RI alpha chain (mAb15--1) to human PMNS: Conversely, preincubation of PMNs with mAb15--1 inhibits significantly the binding of IgE Fc fragment to PMNs, indicating that IgE bound to the cell surface of PMNs mainly via the Fc epsilon RI. Peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) PMNs from asthmatic subjects also express intracellular Fc epsilon RI alpha and beta chain immunoreactivity. Engagement of Fc epsilon RI induces the release of IL-8 by PMNS: Collectively, these observations provide new evidence that PMNs express the Fc epsilon RI and suggest that these cells may play a role in allergic inflammation through an IgE-dependent activation mechanism."

The phenotypes associated with TSC1 and TSC2 mutations are largely indistinguishable suggesting a common biochemical pathway. Indeed, hamartin and tuberin have been shown to interact stably in vitro and in vivo. Factors that regulate their interaction are likely critical to the understanding of disease pathogenesis. In this study, we showed that tuberin is phosphorylated at serine and tyrosine residues in response to serum and other factors, and it undergoes serial phosphorylation that can be detected by differences in electrophoretic mobilities. A disease-related TSC2 mutation (Y1571H) nearly abolished tuberin phosphorylation when stimulated with pervanadate. Expression of this mutant tuberin caused a marked reduction in TSC1-TSC2 interaction compared with wild-type protein and significantly curtailed the growth inhibitory effects of tuberin when overexpressed in COS1 cells, consistent with a loss of function mutation. Examination of a second pathologic mutation, P1675L, revealed a similar relationship between limited phosphorylation and reduced interaction with hamartin. Our data show for the first time that 1) tuberin is phosphorylated at tyrosine and serine residues, 2) TSC1-TSC2 interaction is regulated by tuberin phosphorylation, and 3) defective phosphorylation of tuberin is associated with loss of its tumor suppressor activity.

Gomez M.R. Sampson J.R. Whittemore V.H. Tuberous Sclerosis. 3d Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1999: 10-23Google Scholar). The common clinical manifestations stem from growths in the brain (cortical tubers), kidney (angiomyolipoma and cysts), heart (rhabdomyomas), and skin (2Roach E.S. Gomez M.R. Northrup H. J. Child Neurol. 1998; 13: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). As such, it commonly results in epilepsy, mental retardation, renal complications, and premature deaths. Although pathologically diverse, the lesions in TSC share common features of excessive proliferation, abnormal differentiation, and aberrant migration. Genetic studies of families have successfully identified two genetic loci that are responsible for this disease (3van Slegtenhorst M. de Hoogt R. Hermans C. Nellist M. Janssen B. Verhoef S.

Within the last few years, the two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, have been positionally cloned, allowing investigations that will lead to the understanding of the molecular basis of TSC. The function of these genes has been partially elucidated to date. There is evidence to suggest that the TSC2 product, tuberin, suppresses tumorigenicity (5Jin F. Wienecke R. Xiao G. Maize J.C.

In addition, hamartin was shown to interact with ezrin-radixin-moesin and regulate cell adhesion (16Lamb R.F. Roy C. Diefenbach T.J. Vinters H.V. Johnson M.W. Jay D.G. Hall A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, there is no unifying concept of how these two genes may influence these processes. Further, there has not been any study addressing the regulation of hamartin and tuberin in the context of their physiologic role as tumor suppressor genes. Among the various properties of these two proteins, their ability to interact and to form a stable complex has been the most consistent finding (13van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 14Plank T.L. Yeung R.S. Henske E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4766-4770PubMed Google Scholar). Their interaction fits well with the concept that the gene products function along a common biologic pathway. Thus, mutation of either gene can give rise to a similar clinical phenotype. This led to the hypothesis that hamartin and tuberin may function as a complex, and factors regulating their interaction will be important in understanding their physiologic roles. In this study, we discovered that tuberin undergoes reversible phosphorylation at serine and tyrosine residues that can be detected by mobility shifts on SDS-PAGE gels in response to serum and other stimuli. Two disease-related missense mutations of TSC2 gave rise to proteins that were defective in their ability to be phosphorylated. As such, they were unable to interact efficiently with hamartin, thus abolishing the tumor suppressor activity of the complex. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms of TSC1-TSC2 gene functional regulation. HeLa, COS1, and NIH3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). EEF126–4, EEF 126–8, and LEF8 cells were derived as described previously (5Jin F. Wienecke R. Xiao G. Maize J.C. DeClue J.E. Yeung R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Yeung R.S. Henske E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4766-4770PubMed Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The previously described rat wild-type TSC2 in pBS plasmid was used as the template (5Jin F. Wienecke R. Xiao G. Maize J.C. DeClue J.E. Yeung R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The TSC1 and TSC2 plasmids were transfected into 60–80% confluent COS1 cells using LipofectAMINE as described by the manufacturer. 48 h post-transfection cells were treated as shown in figures. A stock solution of pervanadate (PV) was prepared fresh each time by mixing equal volumes of 0.1 m H2O2 and 0.1m Na3VO4. The stimulation reactions were stopped by washing culture dishes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were immediately lysed in harvest buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmEGTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40 plus 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.25 mg/ml AEBSF). Cells were broken by passing through a syringe with a 22-gauge needle, and the extract was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was used for experiments. Aliquots containing equivalent amounts of cellular protein were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 4 μl of either IgG-purified L3–2 (TSC2) or 4050 (TSC1) antibodies. 20 microliters of 1:1 (v/v) of protein A-Sepharose in harvest buffer was added to each tube and incubated overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with harvest buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of 1.5× sample buffer. For phosphatase treatment, immunoprecipitates were washed with harvest buffer containing no EGTA or sodium vanadate, incubated at 30 °C for 30 min under conditions suggested by the manufacturer, and stopped by adding 4× sample buffer. Cell extracts or immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on a 7% low (30:0.4) bisacrylamide SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF membrane for Western blotting. Tuberin was visualized using polyclonal IgG-purified anti-tuberin (L3–2) (15Xiao G. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemis E.A. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6097-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:500. The hamartin antibody was used at a dilution of 1:100, and both were followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:5000. Antibody complexes were visualized by chemiluminescent detection using ECL reagent. COS1 cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected as above. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% FBS overnight, washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then incubated with 0.5 mCi of orthophosphate in 2 ml of phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.1% FBS for 6 h. 10% FBS and pervanadate (0.1 mm final concentration) were added to the cells 30 min prior to the end of labeling. The cells were harvested, and ∼50 μg of total protein was immunoprecipitated as above. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane, and the32P-labeled tuberin was visualized by autoradiography. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described previously (17Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar,18Grangeasse C. Riberty M. Vaganay E. Duclos B. Biotechniques. 1999; 27: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, the individual 32P-labeled tuberin bands were excised and subjected to acid hydrolysis in 6 N HCl at 110 °C for 1 h. The hydrolyzed protein was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube, lyophilized, and dissolved in 12 μl of H2O. Two-dimensional TLC was performed by spotting 1/12 of the hydrolyzed protein plus 1 μl of a 1 mg/ml mix of phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine in the corner of a TLC plate. The first-dimension separation was by chromatography in ethanol/glacial acetic acid/water (1:1:1; v/v/v) for 90 min at room temperature. Separation in the second dimension was performed by chromatography in isobutyl alcohol/formic acid/water (8:3:4, v/v/v) for 40 min at room temperature. Phosphoamino acids were visualized by spraying with a solution of 0.5% ninhydrin in 0.5% acetone and heating at 80 °C for 5 min. Labeled amino acids were visualized by autoradiography. COS1 cells were transfected as above. 24 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer. The cells were then spun down, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed by addition of harvest buffer as above. Protein assays were performed using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit. It has been observed previously that polyclonal anti-tuberin antibodies can detect multiple bands at the expected molecular mass range of 180–195 kDa on Western blotting (11Wienecke R. Konig A. DeClue J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16409-16414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This has been attributed to the existence of known TSC2 splice variants. In this study, we examined whether the variation in tuberin mobility is related to a change in phosphorylation states. Endogenous tuberin was examined in cell lines derived from the Eker rat, which carries a germline mutation of TSC2 (Fig.1 A). The 126–4 rat embryo fibroblasts contain wild-type tuberin that migrated as a broad band, as compared with a faster migrating TSC2 protein from the LEF8 cells derived from a renal tumor. The TSC2 gene in the latter cells does not exhibit abnormal splicing of exons 25 or 31, and the remaining TSC2 coding regions did not show any deletion (data not shown). This led us to believe that other modifications such as phosphorylation could be responsible. To determine whether the mobility difference was because of phosphorylation, cells were treated with 100 μm PV, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor and kinase activator. Following 30 min of treatment, wild-type tuberin in 126–4 cells showed a shift toward the slower migrating forms, whereas the tuberin from LEF8 cells showed minimal mobility change (Fig. 1 A). The observed mobility shift of the wild-type tuberin was also noted in other cell lines with the exception of COS1 cells, where the majority of the endogenous tuberin migrates slower constitutively (Fig. 1 B). Wild-type tuberin overexpressed in COS1 cells, however, exhibited a band shift in response to pervanadate (Fig. 1 C). This, in part, was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation as shown by specific immunoreactivity to the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, PY99. Further, the slower migration of the TSC2 band caused by pervanadate can be reversed by treatment with various phosphatases (Fig. 1 C). Exposure of wild-type tuberin to λ phosphatase dramatically enhanced its mobility and eliminated immunoreactivity to PY99. Recombinant PP1 (catalytic subunit), which possesses serine/threonine and some tyrosine phosphatase activities (19MacKintosh C. Garton A.J. McDonnell A. Barford D. Cohen P.T.W. Tonks N.K. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), caused a similar shift in mobility, as well as loss of PY99 immunoreactivity. Treatment with a tyrosine phosphatase, LAR (catalytic domain), eliminated the PY99 signal but did not affect mobility of the tuberin band. These observations are consistent with multiple phosphorylation events affecting tuberin mobility. Although other modifications such as ubiquitination can affect electrophoretic mobility, such changes are not reversible by phosphatase treatment (20Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). We conclude that the frequently observed “doublets” and band shifts of tuberin on Western blotting can be accounted for by various states of protein phosphorylation. To determine whether tuberin phosphorylation is part of the physiologic response to serum and other stimuli, electrophoretic migration of tuberin was examined following exposure to various factors. Among the treatments, FBS (10%) and anisomycin (25 μg/ml) produced a band shift, whereas platelet-derived growth factor-BB (20 ng/ml) and forskolin (10 μm) did not have a detectable effect on the migration of tuberin from TSC2-transfected COS1 cells (Fig.2 A). Endogenous tuberin also responded in a similar fashion. Upon serum starvation, tuberin in NIH3T3 cells shifted toward the dephosphorylated state whereas serum-fed cells maintained a level of phosphorylation in between the starved and pervanadate-treated states (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, tuberin in the tumor-derived LEF8 cells did not respond to the treatments and remained in a mobility state that was faster than that seen with wild-type tuberin during serum starvation. Taken together, the data showed that tuberin undergoes reversible phosphorylation in response to multiple extracellular signals, and its phosphorylation state can be detected by electrophoretic migration. Also, one might infer that the tuberin from LEF8 cells could be defective in its ability to be phosphorylated. Interestingly, hamartin did not show a significant change in band migration under the same conditions (Fig. 2 B, lower panel); future studies will address the role of phosphorylation for hamartin. To determine which amino acids are phosphorylated, tuberin overexpressed in COS1 cells (starved or stimulated with FBS/PV) was labeled in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-tuberin antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto PVDF membranes, and examined by autoradiography. The bands corresponding to phosphorylated tuberin were excised from the membrane, digested, and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis and Cerenkov counting. As shown in Fig. 3 A, LAR phosphatase reduced total phosphorylation to 82% of the PV-treated level while maintaining much of the tyrosine phosphorylation despite the loss of PY99 signal on Western blotting. Both PP1 and λ phosphatases decreased phosphorylation of tuberin to 14 and 11% of the pervanadate-treated control, respectively. Overall, the amount of [32P]orthophosphate incorporation correlated well with tuberin mobility. When the samples were analyzed by two-dimensional TLC, it was clearly shown that tuberin was phosphorylated on serine and tyrosine but not threonine residues (Fig. 3 A). To evaluate the biologic significance of TSC2 phosphorylation, two naturally occurring TSC2 mutants were examined. The first mutant was found in the LEF8 cells, an Eker-derived renal tumor cell line that has not undergone loss of heterozygosity at the TSC2 locus. Sequence analysis of the TSC2 coding regions confirmed a single base pair substitution (T4800C, rat) (data not shown). This results in a non-conservative amino acid change, from tyrosine to histidine (Y1571H, human; Y1573H, rat). This tyrosine lies within the putative Rap1 GTPase-activating protein homology domain of TSC2 and is highly conserved in evolution. To examine the phosphorylation properties of the Y1571H mutant, an expression construct containing this change was made by site-directed mutagenesis and was overexpressed in COS1 cells. Western blotting confirmed the increased mobility of the expressed mutant protein and the minimal shift in response to PV treatment, similar to that seen in the parental LEF8 cells (data not shown). Based on the amount of [32P]orthophosphate incorporation, the Y1571H mutant labeled very minimally after FCS/PV treatment, compared with wild-type tuberin (Fig. 3 B). Further, TLC analysis showed that both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation were significantly reduced. This is consistent with a model in which tyrosine 1571 is a phosphorylation site that may be required for serial phosphorylation of both serine and tyrosine residues. A second TSC2 missense mutation that has been recurrently identified in patients with tuberous sclerosis was also examined. The P1675L mutation was isolated from 10 unrelated TSC individuals, and it lies within the rabaptin5-binding domain (21Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). The expression construct containing this amino acid change was generated by site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by direct sequencing. Overexpression of the P1675L construct produced a stable protein that migrated faster than the wild-type tuberin, similar to that seen with the Y1571H mutant (Fig.4 B). The P1675L mutant tuberin did not respond to pervanadate treatment, and phosphoamino acid analysis confirmed minimal incorporation of [32P]orthophosphate affecting both the serine and tyrosine residues (Fig. 3 B). Our data suggest that tuberin phosphorylation is affected by disease-causing mutations. Substantial evidence indicates that tuberin and hamartin form a stable complex in vivo (13van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 14Plank T.L. Yeung R.S. Henske E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4766-4770PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that phosphorylation of tuberin may play a role in regulating its interaction with hamartin. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on endogenous and overexpressed, exogenous TSC1 and TSC2 proteins. As expected, the wild-type hamartin and tuberin in EEF126–4 and NIH3T3 fibroblasts formed a stable complex as they were able to be immunoprecipitated by both anti-tuberin and anti-hamartin antibodies (Fig. 4 A). However, the mutant form of tuberin found in tumor cells, LEF8, did not interact with hamartin. The lack of co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous proteins was not because of the absence of hamartin. In addition, when the mutant Y1571H and wild-type TSC1 were transiently overexpressed in COS1 cells, only a fraction of the two proteins were recovered as a complex, compared with the wild-type TSC2 (Fig. 4 B). Under conditions of protein overexpression (>20-fold increase), some degree of interaction was retained by the mutant product. When the expression constructs were transiently transfected into tuberin-deficient rat embryonic fibroblasts, EEF126–8 cells, transgene expression was modest (∼2-fold), and only the wild-type tuberin, not the Y1571H mutant, was shown to interact with hamartin (data not shown). We also tested the ability of the P1675L mutant to interact with hamartin when expressed in COS1 cells. Again, the amount of complex formation relative to the expression levels of the individual proteins was significantly less for the mutant, compared with the wild-type tuberin (Fig.4 B). Previous experiments have shown that wild-type tuberin exerts growth inhibitory effects when overexpressed in cells, transiently or stably (5Jin F. Wienecke R. Xiao G. Maize J.C. DeClue J.E. Yeung R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 9: 9154-9159Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We tested the biologic activity of the Y1571H mutant in transient transfection of COS1 cells. 24 h after transfection, the cell number and protein concentration were measured as an index of cell proliferation (Fig. 5). In accordance with previous studies, cells overexpressing wild-type tuberin showed a reduction of 49% in cell number and a drop of 50% in protein concentration, compared with the vector control. In contrast, the Y1571H mutant induced only a modest reduction of 20% in cell number and 27% in protein concentration. In both cases, the exogenous tuberin was expressed to nearly equal levels of at least 20-fold over the endogenous levels. The same result in cell number reduction was observed when the experiment was repeated in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). Tuberous sclerosis is an example of the “two genes, one disease” paradigm where mutation of either one of its two responsible loci, TSC1 and TSC2, will result in the expression of a similar phenotype. Evidence from genetic and biochemical analyses is congruent with the concept of functional cooperativity of the two gene products, hamartin and tuberin. However, the biologic significance of their interaction and its regulation have not been reported. In this study, we demonstrated that tuberin is phosphorylated at serine and tyrosine residues, and this process is altered by the two missense mutations examined. One consequence of the hypophosphorylated mutant forms of tuberin is the reduction in their interaction with hamartin and correspondingly, the loss of the growth inhibitory function of tuberin. Our data support the notion that regulation of TSC1-TSC2 interaction through tuberin phosphorylation is critical to their biologic function. Mutations that disrupt the integrity of the tuberin-hamartin functional complex can lead to the initiation of disease. We also showed that various phosphorylation states of tuberin can be easily detected by their different electrophoretic mobilities. The regulation of tuberin phosphorylation is likely complex and has not been fully elucidated in this study. The wild-type TSC2 product undergoes reversible phosphorylation in response to physiologic stimuli, such as serum. Based on phosphoamino acid analysis and electrophoretic mobility shifts, there exists multiple sites involving serine and tyrosine residues. Assuming that each mobility shift represents a different phosphorylation state, we can deduce a minimum of four levels of TSC2 phosphorylation beyond the basal state, but mapping of specific phosphorylation sites awaits further studies. Of the two mutants described, the effect of Y1571H on tuberin phosphorylation strongly suggests that the Y1571 can itself be phosphorylated. Review of other pathologic missense TSC2 mutations has identified four additional tyrosine or serine residues that may be relevant to its phosphorylation (21Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Based on 32P labeling, the effect of the P1675L mutant on reducing tuberin phosphorylation can be interpreted as more complete than the Y1571H mutation. The disruption of the proline residue is predicted to have profound effects on the structural conformation of the protein and consequently, is likely to abolish interaction with the appropriate kinase(s). This site resides in the rabaptin5-binding domain (15Xiao G. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemis E.A. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6097-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and represents a common amino acid altered by naturally occurring mutations; it was reported in 10 independent cases of tuberous sclerosis (21Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Our findings lead us to believe that tuberin phosphorylation is targeted by natural mutations and is important to its function. Although direct interaction between TSC1 and TSC2 proteins has been confirmed by yeast two-hybrid analyses and co-immunoprecipitation studies (13van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 14Plank T.L. Yeung R.S. Henske E.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4766-4770PubMed Google Scholar), the binding domains have not been completely elucidated. Reports have suggested that the N terminus of tuberin is essential for hamartin interaction (13van Slegtenhorst M. Nellist M. Nagelkerken B. Cheadle J. Snell R. van den Ouweland A. Reuser A. Sampson J. Halley D. van der Sluijs P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1053-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 22Hodges A.K. Maynard J. Parry L. DeClue J.E. Cheadle J. Sampson J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67 (abstr.): 404Google Scholar). Here, we showed that phosphorylation sites outside the putative interaction domains are also critical to hamartin-tuberin interaction. Because there exists a high degree of concordance between interaction and phosphorylation in the mutants studied in this report, it is difficult to isolate the effects of interaction on phosphorylation. The fact that wild-type tuberin overexpressed alone can undergo phosphorylation in response to pervanadate treatment to the same degree as when it is co-expressed with hamartin would strongly suggest that tuberin phosphorylation is not dependent on its interaction with hamartin. 2Unpublished data. The concept of phosphorylation-regulated protein interaction has been noted in diverse signaling pathways. Our characterization of tuberin phosphorylation and its effects on hamartin interaction provides new insights into the regulation of its tumor suppressor function. Analyses of the missense mutations support the biologic significance of TSC2 phosphorylation. Further understanding of the pathways that modify its phosphorylation state will provide opportunities to manipulate its function exogenously as therapy for patients with tuberous sclerosis.

Second, inhibitor studies argue that separate enzymes catalyze the 7α- and 7β-hydroxylation of DHEA and pregnenolone in brain (31Doostzadeh J. Morfin R. Steroids. 1996; 61: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 33Doostzadeh J. Cotillon A.C. Morfin R. J.

Third, metabolism of A/anediol in rodent brain and also prostate is principally at the 6α position (24Warner M. Strömstedt M. Möller L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2699-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Akwa Y. Morfin R.F. Robel P. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 26Gemzik B. Green J. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem.

Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1077-1083PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps indicative of a separate A/anediol hydroxylase enzyme.To address these questions the identity of the brain enzyme, its relationship to the observed activities, and expression pattern, we prepared mice harboring a targeted insertion of a reporter gene cassette (IRES-lacZ) into Cyp7b. We describe reporter gene activity in brain and other tissues and explore alterations in ex vivo steroid hydroxylation in tissues ofCyp7b −/− mice. We argue that the Cyp7b locus encodes a major pathway of extrahepatic steroid and oxysterol hydroxylation.DISCUSSIONWe have used gene targeting to address the relationship of CYP7B enzyme to the steroid and sterol hydroxylation activities reported in rodent tissues. Li-Hawkins et al. (47Li-Hawkins J. Lund E.G. Turley S.D. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16536-16542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) recently and independently reported mice in which the Cyp7b gene had been disrupted; their studies centered on cholesterol metabolism in liver. We now describe transgenic mice in which a reporter gene (lacZ) is inserted into the Cyp7b gene; we report expression studies and steroid/sterol metabolism in extrahepatic tissues of the mutant mouse.Our principal observations are as follows. First, steroid hydroxylation activity and CY7B mRNA are widely distributed in brain and other tissues. Second, targeting the mouse Cyp7b gene with anIRES-lacZ construct generates reporter enzyme activity in multiple tissues including brain, kidney, and liver; brain reporter expression was dramatically, if superficially, restricted to the dentate gyrus. Third, the pattern of reporter activity in brain failed to match exactly the distribution of CYP7B mRNA or LacZ mRNA, although the reporter activity/mRNA patterns in liver and kidney were largely coincident. Fourth, mice lacking CYP7B activity are viable and superficially normal. Fifth, ex vivoextracts of homozygous Cyp7b −/− animals fail to catalyze hydroxylation of the steroid (and sterol) substrates tested, including DHEA and 25-hydroxycholesterol. Sixth, the targeted mutation also abolished hydroxylation (presumed to be at 6α) of the 5α-reduced steroid, A/anediol. These aspects are discussed separately below.CYP7B expression, originally suspected to be most robustly expressed in hippocampus, is found more widely. Transcripts were readily detected in rat brain, but also at significant levels in spleen, heart, prostate, lung, and ovary, in addition to kidney and liver expression in both mouse and rat (this work and Ref. 36Stapleton G. Steel M. Richardson M. Mason J.O. Rose K.A. Morris R.G. Lathe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29739-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Relative levels of expression are difficult to assess precisely, but appeared highest in brain, and particularly in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus; high levels are present in prostate, with significant levels in liver, kidney, heart, and spleen. The level of mRNA expression in ovary was lower. Three mRNAs are present in brain and some other tissues: a pair of transcripts at 2 kb (1.8 and 2.1) and a much larger RNA (∼5 kb) that is prominent in rat but not mouse brain; while the two smaller transcripts are thought to arise by alternative polyadenylation site utilization (36Stapleton G. Steel M. Richardson M. Mason J.O. Rose K.A. Morris R.G. Lathe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29739-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), the origin of the larger transcript is not known. 7α-Hydroxylation activity is also widespread, and we report conversion of DHEA to a molecule comigrating with 7α-hydroxy-DHEA in several rat and mouse tissues including brain, spleen, thymus, heart, lung, testis, prostate, uterus, ovary, and mammary gland, although the efficiency of conversion varied between tissues. Liver and kidney metabolism was complex, precluding specific analysis of B-ring hydroxylation. Most of these tissues hydroxylate A/anediol and 25-hydroxycholesterol (this work and data not presented) in addition to DHEA (this work). In contrast, the potent anesthetic steroid 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol was very poorly metabolized by the majority of these tissues, including brain (not presented). In addition to 7α-hydroxylation of DHEA, we also observed a slightly more slowly migrating species, molecule 1, that is inferred, on the basis of other experiments 4E. DeGryse, P. Vico, and R. Lathe, unpublished data. , to be the 17β-HSD product of DHEA, androstenediol, also a substrate for CYP7B (40Rose K.A. Stapleton G. Dott K. Kieny M.P. Best R. Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Björkhem I. Seckl J. Lathe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This emphasizes previous reports that 17β-HSD activity is also widespread in brain and other tissues (48Martel C. Rheaume E. Takahashi M. Trudel C. Couet J. Luu-The V. Simard J. Labrie F. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 41: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar).We generated mice harboring a targeted insertion of anIRES-lacZ reporter cassette. Chromogenic staining was observed in both liver and kidney, organs in which CYP7B mRNA is present (Ref. 36Stapleton G. Steel M. Richardson M. Mason J.O. Rose K.A. Morris R.G. Lathe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29739-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar and this work); the staining pattern was similar to the patterns of CYP7B mRNA or LacZ sequences detected by in situ hybridization. Staining in kidney was associated with the S3 segment of the outer stripe of the medulla, a region of acid-base and electrolyte exchange, fuel resorption, and metabolic activity. Liver staining appeared largely in the perivenous zone of the lobules, where glycolysis predominates. The function of CYP7B in these regions is not known. No staining was observed in other tissues analyzed (not presented), probably because of the insensitivity of this technique, with the exception of peri-follicular staining in ovary and intense staining in seminiferous tubules.3In the brain, strikingly vivid reporter staining was seen in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, with only lower levels in cerebellum. Overt coloration was absent from other brain regions including cortex and olfactory bulb. Punctate staining in the dentate gyrus is reminiscent of the pattern seen previously with the kin gene trap insertion (49Steel M. Moss J. Clark K.A. Kearns I.R. Davies C.H. Morris R.G. Skarnes W.C. Lathe R. Hippocampus. 1998; 8: 444-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and suggestive of association of the reporter enzyme with discrete membrane components; these could be a subclass of synapses or other unidentified structures. Here, in contrast to liver and kidney, reporter expression failed to parallel either CYP7B or LacZ mRNA. Staining was restricted to dentate gyrus and, at lower levels, cerebellum; hippocampal regions CA1–3 were essentially negative. In contrast, CYP7B mRNA and transgene-encoded LacZ mRNA were through much of cortex, hippocampus, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. Nevertheless, localized LacZ activity reiterates the restricted expression exploited for CYP7B cDNA isolation (36Stapleton G. Steel M. Richardson M. Mason J.O. Rose K.A. Morris R.G. Lathe R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29739-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Because DHEA 7-hydroxylation activity is present in microdissected brain regions including olfactory bulb, cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, and is abolished by the mutation, 5K. Rose, S. Gauldie, and R. Lathe, unpublished data. our results would seem to exclude a second unidentified enzyme with significant ex vivo activity. Possible explanations for the reporter/mRNA discrepancy include: 1) tissue specificity of IRES elements (50Creancier L. Morello D. Mercier P. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); 2) structure and/or processing of the hybrid RNA may differ between dentate and the CA regions; 3) β-galactosidase enzyme is multimeric: LacZ staining may show a threshold effect; 4) possible post-transcriptional control of CYP7B expression: 7-hydroxylation, presumably mediated by CYP7B, is modulated by cell density (51Akwa Y.

Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 52: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), although the mechanism has not been determined.Intercrossing heterozygous Cyp7b +/− animals generated homozygous −/− animals at or near the expected frequency. Although our data do not rule out some selective perinatal loss of male homozygotes, we conclude that Cyp7b gene function is not essential for viability in adult mice; a similar conclusion was reached by another group (47Li-Hawkins J. Lund E.G. Turley S.D. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16536-16542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This contrasts with the situation in human, where CY7B deficiency was associated with abormalities of hepatic cholesterol metabolism and was incompatible with survival (43Setchell K.D. Schwarz M. O'Connell N.C. Lund E.G. Davis D.L. Lathe R. Thompson H.R. Weslie Tyson R. Sokol R.J. Russell D.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1690-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Species differences in hepatic cholesterol metabolism were previously suggested by studies on CYP27 (cholesterol 27-hydroxylase): human mutations produce disordered lipid metabolism, atherosclerosis, and mental retardation (cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis; Ref. 53Björkhem I. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 1994; 204S: 68-72Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar); mice lacking CYP27 display no CTX-related pathological abnormalities (54Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14805-14812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).We inspected tissues from Cyp7b −/− mice for their ability to catalyze steroid and oxysterol hydroxylation ex vivo. 7α-Hydroxylation of DHEA was abolished in brain, spleen, thymus, lung, heart, uterus, and mammary gland; gene disruption not only abolished 7α-hydroxylation of DHEA, but also of pregnenolone, A/enediol, and 25-hydroxycholesterol. The complexity of steroid and sterol conversions in transgenic and control liver precluded analysis of specific B-ring modification. In brain and other tissues, homozygous disruption of the Cyp7b gene also abolishes the production of two minor products, probably 7β-hydroxy-DHEA (ascertained by TLC comigration) and a second product with a TLC migration slightly faster than 7α-hydroxy-DHEA: this is inferred (but not proven), on the basis of this and other work (40Rose K.A. Stapleton G. Dott K. Kieny M.P. Best R. Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Björkhem I. Seckl J. Lathe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 31Doostzadeh J. Morfin R. Steroids. 1996; 61: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 34Doostzadeh J. Cotillon A.C.

Steroids. 1998; 63: 608-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), to correspond to the 6α-hydroxy derivative of DHEA. Both products are generated in vitro by recombinant CYP7B enzyme (40Rose K.A. Stapleton G. Dott K. Kieny M.P. Best R. Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Björkhem I. Seckl J. Lathe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We conclude that minor modification of DHEA at the 7β and probably 6α positions is an inherent property of CYP7B enzyme. This contrasts with the conclusion, on the basis of inhibitor studies, that different enzymes in brain and prostate are responsible for 7α- and 7β-hydroxylation of DHEA and pregnenolone (34Doostzadeh J. Cotillon A.C. Morfin R. Steroids. 1998; 63: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 35Doostzadeh J. Cotillon A.C. Benalycherif A. Morfin R.

Steroids. 1996; 61: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Incubation of A/anediol with extracts of mouse brain (this work) or recombinant CYP7B enzyme (this work and Ref. 40Rose K.A. Stapleton G. Dott K. Kieny M.P. Best R. Schwarz M. Russell D.W. Björkhem I. Seckl J. Lathe R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4925-4930Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) yielded, like DHEA, one major and two minor polar metabolites. The major metabolite of A/anediol produced by brain ex vivo is 6α-hydroxy-A/anediol (5α-androstane-3β,6α,17β-triol) as reported previously (24Warner M. Strömstedt M. Möller L. Gustafsson J.-Å. Endocrinology. 1989; 124: 2699-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Akwa Y. Morfin R.F. Robel P. Baulieu E.E. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 26Gemzik B. Green J. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Strömstedt M. Warner M. Banner C.D. MacDonald P.C. Gustafsson J.-Å. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1077-1083PubMed Google Scholar); this comigrated with the major CYP7B product. We infer, but have not formally proven, that CYP7B catalyzes 6α-hydroxylation of A/anediol and that the less abundant A/anediol metabolites correspond to 7α- and 7β-hydroxylated derivatives. Ex vivo production of all these molecules was abolished by Cyp7b gene disruption (<0.1% of the wild-type conversion level in Cyp7b −/− extracts).Disruption of the Cyp7b gene therefore abolishes hydroxyation of DHEA, pregnenolone, A/enediol, and 25-hydroxycholesterol, at both major (7α) and minor (7β, 6α?) positions. It also abolishes hydroxylation of A/anediol, both at the major (6α) position and at minor positions. We suggest that one gene product, CYP7B enzyme, is responsible for all these activities.This study does not rule out formally the possibility that different transcripts from the CYP7B gene might encode physically distinct enzymes with separate substrate specificities and hydroxylation stereochemistry. We think this unlikely. First, substrate specificity and stereochemistry for these conversions can vary according to reaction conditions (26Gemzik B. Green J. Parkinson A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 355-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 31Doostzadeh J. Morfin R. Steroids. 1996; 61: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Second, the hydroxylation profiles of DHEA and A/anediol by brain and recombinant CYP7B enzyme are indistinguishable.4CYP7B is thereby likely to furnish a major extrahepatic and broad-spectrum steroid/sterol B-ring hydroxylase, with predominant hydroxylation at the 7α position (exemplified by DHEA and oxysterols) complemented by 6α-hydroxylation of some atypical substrates (exemplified by A/anediol). CYP7B is not the only extrahepatic B-ring hydroxylase; a testosterone 7α-hydroxylase has been described in testis (CYP2A9/15: Refs. 55Son"
https://openalex.org/W2092958495,"To understand the long-term metabolic and functional consequences of increased GLUT4 content, intracellular substrate utilization was investigated in isolated muscles of transgenic mice overexpressing GLUT4 selectively in fast-twitch skeletal muscles. Rates of glycolysis, glycogen synthesis, glucose oxidation, and free fatty acid (FFA) oxidation as well as glycogen content were assessed in isolated EDL (fast-twitch) and soleus (slow-twitch) muscles from female and male MLC-GLUT4 transgenic and control mice. In male MLC-GLUT4 EDL, increased glucose influx predominantly led to increased glycolysis. In contrast, in female MLC-GLUT4 EDL increased glycogen synthesis was observed. In both sexes, GLUT4 overexpression resulted in decreased exogenous FFA oxidation rates. The decreased rate of FFA oxidation in male MLC-GLUT4 EDL was associated with increased lipid content in liver, but not in muscle or at the whole body level. To determine how changes in substrate metabolism and insulin action may influence energy balance in an environment that encouraged physical activity, we measured voluntary training activity, body weight, and food consumption of MLC-GLUT4 and control mice in cages equipped with training wheels. We observed a small decrease in body weight of MLC-GLUT4 mice that was paradoxically accompanied by a 45% increase in food consumption. The results were explained by a marked fourfold increase in voluntary wheel exercise. The changes in substrate metabolism and physical activity in MLC-GLUT4 mice were not associated with dramatic changes in skeletal muscle morphology. Collectively, results of this study demonstrate the feasibility of altering muscle substrate utilization by overexpression of GLUT4. The results also suggest that as a potential treatment for type II diabetes mellitus, increased skeletal muscle GLUT4 expression may provide benefits in addition to improvement of insulin action."
https://openalex.org/W2135078756,"Estrogen has many positive effects on neural tissue in experimental model systems, including stimulation of neurite growth and neurotransmitter synthesis and protection against diverse types of neural injury. In humans, estrogen treatment is reputed to protect against Alzheimer's disease. To investigate potential mediators of estrogen's action and determine whether selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen have estrogen-like effects in the primate brain, we evaluated the expression of glucose transporters and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and its receptor in the frontal cortex of ovariectomized rhesus monkeys. We treated one group for 3 days with vehicle, another with 17 beta estradiol (E2), and a third with tamoxifen. The expression of facilitative glucose transporters (Gluts) 1, 3, and 4 was investigated using in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblot analysis. Gluts 3 and 4 were concentrated in cortical neurons and Glut1 in capillaries and glial cells. E2 treatment induced two- to fourfold increases in Glut3 and Glut4 mRNA levels and lesser but significant increases in Glut3 and 4 protein levels. E2 treatment induced an approximately 70% increase in parenchymal Glut1 mRNA levels, but did not appreciably affect vascular Glut1 gene expression. IGF1 and IGF1 receptor mRNAs were concentrated in cortical neurons in a distribution similar to Gluts 3 and 4. IGF1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in E2-treated animals but IGF1 receptor mRNA levels were not altered by hormone treatment. Tamoxifen increased cerebral cortical Glut3 and 4 mRNA levels, but did not affect Glut1, IGF1, or IGF1 receptor expression. This study provides novel data showing that Gluts 3 and 4 and IGF1 are coexpressed by primate cerebral cortical neurons, where their expression is enhanced by estrogen. These findings suggest that up-regulation of glucose transporter and IGF1 expression may contribute to estrogen's salutary effects on neural tissue. Tamoxifen, an antiestrogen at the breast, is shown to have estrogen-like effects on higher brain centers in the monkey, suggesting that some SERMs may share estrogen's neuroprotective potential for menopausal women."

An analysis of the mechanisms underlying Grx2 protective activity revealed dual activation of signal transduction pathways. Grx2 significantly activated the Ras/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt/NF-κB cascade in parallel to the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/AP1 cascade. Dopamine, in comparison, down-regulated both pathways. Treatment of neurons with Ref-1 antisense oligonucleotide reduced the ability of Grx2 to activate Akt and AP-1 but had no effect on the phosphorylation of JNK1/2, suggesting that Akt/NF-κB and AP-1 are regulated by Ref-1. Exposure of the neurons to JNK1/2 antisense oligonucleotide in the presence of Grx2 significantly reduced AP-1 and NF-κB DNA binding activities and abolished Grx2 protection.

This thiol disulfide interchange reaction is crucial for the maintenance of intracellular redox homeostasis, especially under oxidative stress (6Jung C.H. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Mammalian Grx is widely expressed in different cell types, including neurons (7Garcia-Pardo L. Granados M.D. Gaytan F.

The enzyme can restore the activity of glutathionylated proteins containing mixed disulfides between a protein thiol and GSH (inactive form) by reducing the disulfide bridge to give reduced GSH and the active protein form containing a free thiol. Examples of such GSH-thiol regulation of activity can be found in tyrosine phosphatase 1B (13Barrett W.C. DeGnore J.P. Konig S. Fales H.M. Keny Y.F. Zhang Z.Y. Yim M.B. Chock P.B.

Thanks to the antioxidant properties of Grx activity, human Grx andEscherichia coli Grx2 can rescue cerebellar granule neurons from dopamine (DA)-induced oxidative stress (18Daily D.

DA, the endogenous neurotransmitter of the nigrostriatal pathway, is a powerful oxidant that exerts its toxic effects through its oxidative metabolites. DA-induced oxidations are generally implicated in neurodegenerative processes (19Buisson A. Callebert J. Mathieu E. Plotkine M. Boulu R. J.

Administration of DA to rat striatum caused pre- and postsynaptic damage (23Filloux F. Townsend J.J. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 119: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Intraventricular injection of DA in rats resulted in dose-dependent death of the animals (24Ben-Shachar D. Zuk R. Glinka Y. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 718-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro studies have shown that DA can cause cell death in mesencephalic, striatal, and cortical primary neuron cultures (25Rosenberg P.A.

DA-induced cell death in sympathetic, cerebellar granule neurons, PC-12 cells, and thymocytes has all the features of apoptotic cell death (30Ziv I. Melamed E. Nardi N. Luria D. Achiron A. Offen D. Barzilai A. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 170: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 31Offen D. Ziv I. Gorodin S. Barzilai A. Malik Z. Melamed E. Biochim. Biophys.

Neurobiol. 1997; 17: 101-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Apart from the administration of Grx, the toxic effects of DA can be prevented by the application of small molecular weight antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine, catalase, ascorbic acid, and dithiothreitol (30Ziv I.

Little is known about the molecules and signaling pathways involved in DA-induced apoptosis. Enhancement of the DNA binding activity of NF-κB protects neurons from DA-induced apoptosis (18Daily D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Offen D. Mittelman L. Melamed E. Holmgren A. Barzilai A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1335-1344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A survival signal pathway that might activate NF-κB is the Ras/PI3K/Akt/NF-κB cascade (35Perez-Sala D. Rebollo A. Cell. Death Differ. 1999; 6: 722-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Ras is a family of proteins involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and differentiation and survival of different cell types (37Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 38Inglese J. Koch W.J. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ras activation is localized on the inner surface of the cell membrane where it cycles between two states: a GDP-bound inactive state and a GTP-bound active state. This cycle is regulated by cell surface receptors including tyrosine kinase receptors. Ras-GTP was shown to interact and activate PI3K, a heterodimer composed of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit. PI3K activity is generally regulated by tyrosine kinase receptors (39Rubio I. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Downward J. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, PI3K phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol molecules and generates the phosphorylated products phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate, which bind to the pleckstrin homology domain of the serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B). Akt is then translocated to the plasma membrane where it undergoes phosphorylation by PDK1 and 2 (40Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernamdez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M.

Growth factors and cytokines can also activate Akt via the PI3K pathway (43Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). Activated Akt can phosphorylate and inactivate proapoptotic proteins such as Bad, procaspase 9, glycogen synthase kinase-3, and members of the Forkhead transcription factor family. Alternatively, Akt can activate antiapoptotic proteins such as NF-κB (44Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). NF-κB and AP-1 are transcription factors that are critically important for cell survival and apoptosis. NF-κB consists of homo- or heterodimers of p50, p52, p65 (RelA), RelB or c-Rel. NF-κB proteins are usually expressed in an inactive form, bound to proteins inhibiting their activity named I-κB. Following the appropriate cellular stimulation, I-κB become phosphorylated by the multisubunit I-κB kinase complex, which subsequently targets I-κB for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteosome (54Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The free NF-κB dimer translocates into the nucleus and up-regulates transcription of specific genes (55Grilli M. Chiu J.J.S. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev.

The AP-1 superfamily consists of several subfamilies including Jun, Fos and ATF-2, all of which possess a leucine zipper domain that assists their dimerization (64Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3158) Google Scholar). The AP-1 proteins form homo- and heterodimers before binding to their DNA target sites. The activation of AP-1 is regulated by JNK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (65Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 66Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Experiments with sympathetic and cerebellar granule neurons, as well as with PC-12 cells, revealed that JNK/c-Jun signaling promotes apoptosis after withdrawal of survival factor (67Eilers A.

Studies using JNK (−/−) mice suggested that JNK promotes apoptosis in the hippocampus and in the developing embryonic neural tube. However, in the embryonic forebrain, JNK proteins have the opposite function and are necessary for the survival of developing cortical neurons (70Ham J. Eilers A. Whitfield J. Neame S.J. Shah B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway is also activated in some experimental models of Parkinson's disease (71Saporito M.S. Thomas B.A. Scott R.W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar,72Oo T.F. Henchcliffe C. James D. Burke R.E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Redox factor-1 (Ref-1) is a multifunctional protein that stimulates the DNA binding of numerous transcription factors, among them Fos, Jun, and NF-κB through redox regulation (73Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3323-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Ref-1 possesses apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease DNA repair activity against DNA damage caused by reactive oxygen species, UV and infrared radiation (73Xanthoudakis S. Miao G. Wang F. Pan Y.C.

Our results show that Grx2 protects neurons against DA toxicity through the activation of both Ras/PI3K/Akt and JNK/AP-1 pathways, which culminate in NF-κB activation. In contrast, DA down-regulated these two pathways. Postnatal day 8 BALB/c mice were obtained from Tel Aviv University Animal Care Facility (Glasberg Animal Research Tower). Culture media, sera, and trypsin (0.25% in 0.05% EDTA) were from Biological Industries Co. (Beit hemeek, Israel). 32P was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences; Sephadex G-25 was fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rabbit antibodies against NF-κB p65 and Ref-1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); rabbit anti-PI3K p85 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal antibodies against phospho-JNK/stress-activated protein kinase, JNK, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), and Akt were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal Pan-Ras was from Oncogene (Cambridge MA). E. coliGrx2 was a recombinant preparation purified to homogeneity as described (79Vlamis-Gardikas A. Åslund F. Spyrou G. Bergman T. Holmgren A. J.

Phosphatidylinositol and wortmannin were from Sigma.S-trans, trans-farnesyl thiosalicylic acid (FTS) was kindly provided by Prof. Kloog, Department of Neurobiochemistry, Tel Aviv University. Cultures of highly enriched granule neurons were obtained from postnatal day 8 BALB/c mice (80Lasher R.S. Zagon I.S. Brain Res. 1972; 41: 482-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were dissociated by trypsinization and plated in standard medium basal medium Eagle's, 10% fetal calf serum, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 250 ng/ml amphotericin B supplemented with 1 mg/ml glucose (81Schram M.

Galli C. Ciotti T. Galissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). DA (3-hydroxytyramine hydrochloride; Sigma), was dissolved directly in the proper culture medium. Cerebellar granule neurons were maintained in standard medium for 6–7 days. The medium was then replaced with serum-free standard medium with DA and/or Grx2 for various periods of time. Control cultures were maintained in serum-free standard medium. Prior to addition to the neurons, Grx2 was reduced with 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 20 min at 37 °C. DTT was removed by two spin columns of Sephadex G-25 equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Wortmannin and FTS were incubated for 1 h in serum-free standard medium before administration of DA and Grx2. The viability of the cultures (96-well plates) was assessed by Alamar Blue assay (AccuMed). Alamar reagent (1:10) was added to the treated cells for 2 h at 37 °C. The viability was evaluated by subtracting the fluorescence of the medium alone (without cells) from the fluorescence of the cells at 530 nm excitation wavelength and 590 nm emission wavelength. Protein cell content was determined according to the method of Bradford (83Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 254-257Crossref Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Cerebellar granule neurons were grown on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine hydrobromide (Sigma). Treated neurons were fixed for 30 min in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde and PBS, washed with PBS (pH 7.4), permeabilized for 15 min with 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 14 μg/ml normal goat IgG and 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with anti-p65 or anti-Ref1 antibodies (1:50) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and incubated for 1 h with Cy2-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor ME). To identify the cellular location of Ref-1 or p65, the DNA of the cells were stained with 5 μg/ml DAPI for 5 min. Nuclei were visualized under UV light. Fluorescently stained cells were analyzed using Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM). Zeiss LSM 410 inverted (Oberkochen, Germany) is equipped with a 25-mW krypton-argon laser (488 and 568 maximum lines) and 10-mW He-Ne laser (633 maximum lines). A 40 × NA/1.2 C-apochromat water immersion lens (Axiovert 135M, Zeiss) was used for all imaging. Western blot analysis was performed as described by Harlow and Lane (84Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 475-510Google Scholar), using 12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each lane was loaded with an equal amount of protein extracts (50 or 100 μg) which, after electrophoresis, was transferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 1.5 h. Blots were stained with Ponceau to verify equal loading and transfer of proteins. Membranes were then probed with anti-Ref-1, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-JNK, anti-phospho-Akt, anti-Akt (1:1,000), and Pan anti-Ras (1:2,000) antibodies. For the detection of phospho-JNK, EnVision™+/horseradish peroxidase (rabbit, 1:100) (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) was used to enhance sensitivity. Intensity of the signal was determined by ECL-Plus detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Neurons (7 × 106 cells) were washed with PBS, scraped off, pelleted, and resuspended in 30 μl of hypotonic buffer A (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors). After 15 min on ice, Nonidet P-40 was added (0.6%), and the lysates were spun down at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed (cytoplasmic extract), and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) with frequent vortexing for 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, the nuclear extract was spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The binding reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.4 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 15,000 cpm of 32P-labeled κB or AP-1 oligonucleotides (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ and 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′, respectively) (Promega, Madison WI) was incubated for 30 min with 5 μg of nuclear extract. For AP-1 binding activity, the reaction was done on ice. For specificity control, a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe was applied. Products were analyzed on a 5% acrylamide gel made up in 1 × TGE (50 mmTris, 400 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA). Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film or to Phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics). Quantitative data were obtained using PhosphorImaging (Molecular Dynamics). Ref-1 and JNK1/2 antisense oligonucleotides and the complementary sense oligonucleotides were synthesized and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purified by Sigma Genosys Ltd., Israel. The oligonucleotides were phosphorotioated at the 3′-end (3 last bases) to confer nuclease resistance. The sequence of the Ref-1 antisense probe was 5′-TTCCCCGCTTTGGCATCGC-3′ and the sense 5′-GCGATCCCAAAGCGGGGAA-3′ (18Daily D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Offen D. Mittelman L. Melamed E. Holmgren A. Barzilai A.

The sequence of the JNK1/2 antisense probe was 5′-CGGTAGGCTCGCTTAGCATG-3′ and the sense 5′-TGAGGCGTTAAGACGTTCAA-3′, as described by Shan et al. (85Shan B.J. Price J.O. Gaarde W.A. Monia B.P. Krantz S.B. Zhao Z.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 4067-4076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cerebellar granule neurons were treated with oligonucleotides 6 days after plating. The JNK1/2 antisense was given 2 h before treatment with Grx2 and/or DA. Cerebellar granule neurons were washed with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm NaVO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Cleared lysates were normalized for protein content, and 150 μg of protein was rotated with 2 μl of anti-p85 for 2 h at 4 °C. Thereafter protein G-Sepharose beads were added for overnight incubation. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 10% Nonidet P-40 in PBS and 0.2 mm NaVO4, once with 0.5m LiCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.2 mm NaVO4, and once with TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NaVO4). Kinase reaction was carried out for 15 min at room temperature in kinase buffer consisting of 5 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 25 mmMgCl2, phosphatidylinositol (100 μg/ml sonicated in 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA), 250 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [32P]ATP. The reaction was stopped with 80 μl of 1 n HCl and phospholipids extracted once with 160 μl CHCl3:MeOH (1:1), once with 100 μl of 1n HCl:MeOH (1:1), and the organic phase was dried under N2 and resuspended in 10 μl of CHCl3:MeOH (1:1). Phosphorylated products were resolved on oxalate-impregnated Silica 60 plates (Merck) using CHCl3, MeOH, and 4m NH4OH (9:7:2) as solvent. Radioactive products were visualized and quantitated by PhosphorImaging. Activation of Ras was determined by immunoprecipitation of Ras with GST-RBD (86Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J.

Cells were treated with FTS or DA (with or without Grx2) for different times, washed with PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidin, and 1 mm DTT. The lysates were spun for 15 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Precoupled GST-RBD was added to 100–150 μg of supernatant proteins and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected and rinsed three times in lysis buffer, and bound Ras-GTP proteins were eluted with sample buffer.

https://openalex.org/W2078977165,"Isocitrate dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis (BsIDH) is a member of a family of metal-dependent decarboxylating dehydrogenases. Its crystal structure was solved to 1.55 Å and detailed comparisons with the homologue from Escherichia coli (EcIDH), the founding member of this family, were made. Although the two IDHs are structurally similar, there are three notable differences between them. First, a mostly nonpolar β-strand and two connecting loops in the small domain of EcIDH are replaced by two polar α-helices in BsIDH. Because of a 13-residue insert in this region of BsIDH, these helices protrude over the active site cleft of the opposing monomer. Second, a coil leading into this cleft, the so-called “phosphorylation” loop, is bent inward in the B. subtilis enzyme, narrowing the entrance to the active site from about 12 to 4 Å. Third, although BsIDH is a homodimer, the two unique crystallographic subunits of BsIDH are not structurally identical. The two monomers appear to differ by a domain shift of the large domain relative to the small domain/clasp region, reminiscent of what has been observed in the open/closed conformations of EcIDH. In Escherichia coli, IDH is regulated by reversible phosphorylation by the bifunctional enzyme IDH kinase/phosphatase (IDH-K/P). The site of phosphorylation is Ser113, which lies deep within the active site crevice.

Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9302-9309Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It lies at a critical juncture between the Krebs cycle and the glyoxylate bypass, a pathway required for growth on substrates such as acetate, ethanol, or fatty acids. When one of these substrates serves as the sole source of carbon, induction of the two glyoxylate enzymes, isocitrate lyase and malate synthase, is required to circumvent the quantitative loss of CO2 in the Krebs cycle (2Kornberg H.L. Biochem. J. 1966; 99: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Under these nutritional conditions, ∼75% of the EcIDH is completely inactivated by phosphorylation, thereby partitioning most of the isocitrate through the glyoxylate shunt (3LaPorte D.C. Walsh K.

Chem. 1985; 260: 10563-10568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of EcIDH occurs on an active site serine (Ser113) and involves only minor movements among some neighboring residues (6Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Thorsness P.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3599-3602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No long-range conformational changes are triggered, unlike what is observed for enzymes typified by glycogen phosphorylase (7Sprang S.R. Acharya K.R. Goldsmith E.J. Stuart D.I. Varvill K.

Biol. 1991; 1: 826-835Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the active, dephosphorylated enzyme, isocitrate is hydrogen-bonded to the γ-hydroxyl of Ser113(9Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Sohl J.L.

Phosphorylation of EcIDH prevents isocitrate binding by eliminating this hydrogen bond and by introducing a source of electrostatic repulsion (9Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Sohl J.L. Koshland Jr., D.E.

Science. 1990; 249: 1044-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with the γ-carboxylate of isocitrate. The addition and removal of the phosphate group are catalyzed by a bifunctional 136-kDa dimer, isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase/phosphatase (IDH-K/P) (15LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Nature. 1982; 300: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which phosphorylation inactivates EcIDH has been elucidated, the nature of the protein-protein interactions between EcIDH and its kinase/phosphatase has yet to be determined. The interface between these two enzymes must be extensive since IDH-K/P, in stark contrast to cAMP-dependent protein kinase (16Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4888-4994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar), can phosphorylate neither proteolytic fragments derived from EcIDH nor a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence around the phosphorylation site 2S. P. Miller, R. Chen, E. J. Karschnia, C. Romfo, A. M. Dean, and D. C. LaPorte, unpublished observation.2S. P. Miller, R. Chen, E. J. Karschnia, C. Romfo, A. M. Dean, and D. C. LaPorte, unpublished observation. (18McKee J.S. Hlodan R. Nimmo H.G. Biochimie (Paris). 1989; 71: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition, mutations within the NADP+ binding site, specifically the adenosine 2′,5′-diphosphate binding site, which is fully 13 Å away from the target serine, decrease the K m of IDH kinase for EcIDH by 10-fold (19Miller S.P. Chen R. Karschnia E.J. Romfo C. Dean A.M. LaPorte D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 833-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In EcIDH, the target serine is sequestered in an interdomain cleft between the two monomers (20Hurley J.H. Thorsness P.E. Ramalingham V. Helmers N.H. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). How then does IDH-K/P access the serine? A plausible hypothesis serendipitously emerged with the structure of an orthorhombic, “open” crystal form of EcIDH, where a 16° domain rotation had widened the entrance to the active site cavity from 5 to 13 Å (21Finer-Moore J. Tsutakawa S.E. Cherbavaz D.B. LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13890-13896Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A model was proposed in which EcIDH exists in a conformational equilibrium between open and closed states, with IDH-K/P being able to phosphorylate Ser113 only in the open form. Closer inspection of the model also revealed that the domain rotation had disrupted the substrate binding site by moving apart the amino acids responsible for forming this site. From this observation, it was further postulated that the substrates of EcIDH, isocitrate and NADP+, control the phosphorylation cycle by shifting EcIDH into the closed conformation, thereby precluding IDH-K/P from accessing the sequestered serine (21Finer-Moore J. Tsutakawa S.E. Cherbavaz D.B. LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13890-13896Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Despite the apparent flexibility of EcIDH, it was acknowledged that additional conformational changes, perhaps induced by the binding of IDH-K/P, would be required for Ser113 to become more fully solvent-exposed (21Finer-Moore J. Tsutakawa S.E. Cherbavaz D.B. LaPorte D.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13890-13896Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have addressed the question of accessibility by more closely examining the substrate specificity of IDH-K/P. We chose to study a homologue of EcIDH, isocitrate dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis (BsIDH), and found that it is an extremely poor substrate of both the kinase and phosphatase. 3S. K. Singh, S. P. Miller, L. J. Banaszak, and D. C. LaPorte, manuscript in preparation.3S. K. Singh, S. P. Miller, L. J. Banaszak, and D. C. LaPorte, manuscript in preparation. This was an unexpected finding since BsIDH is 67% identical to its E. coli counterpart and is 100% identical in primary sequence around the phosphorylation site. Furthermore, it exhibits almost complete conservation of active site amino acids (see Fig. 1). It should be noted that there is no evidence that BsIDH is phosphorylated in vivo. 4A. L. Sonenshein, personal communication.4A. L. Sonenshein, personal communication. Because of initial kinetic data demonstrating a large disparity between the abilities of EcIDH and BsIDH to serve as substrates for IDH-K/P, a structural comparison between these two IDHs became an immediate goal. This report describes the results of that pursuit in the 1.55-Å crystal structure of BsIDH. The gene encoding BsIDH (citC) was obtained from anXbaI-XhoI fragment of pKM11 (22Matsuno K. Blais T. Serio A.W. Conway T. Henkin T.M. Sonenshein A.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3382-3391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into an XbaI + XhoI-cut pET16b (Novagen) vector, under control of the T7 promoter, to generate pKM14 for overexpression in E. coli. The lysogenic E. coli host strain (KME44 [KKL1{λDE3}]), in turn, contained a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase gene under lacUV5 control. To prevent contamination from endogenous EcIDH, the strain was specifically designed to possess a kanamycin resistance cassette (kanR) in place of icd, the gene encoding EcIDH. After pKM14 had been transformed into KME44, a single colony was used to inoculate 15 ml of LBG medium (1% Tryptone, 1% NaCl, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.2% glucose, 50 µg/ml amp, and 10 µg/ml kan) and grown overnight. The next morning, 1 liter of fresh LBG was inoculated with 10 ml of the preculture and grown at 37 °C in a gyrating incubator until the A 600 reached 0.4–0.5. At this point, expression of citC was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, and the cells were allowed to grow for an additional 3–4 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifuging at 4500 × g for 10 min, washed with buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm citrate, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (βME), 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol), and resuspended in 20 ml of the same buffer. All manipulations henceforth described occurred either at 4 °C or on ice. The cells were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 20 min to remove cell debris, after which the crude extract was subjected to two ammonium sulfate fractionations: 45% and then 85%. BsIDH precipitated at 85% saturation. Following centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min, the pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer I and dialyzed against three 500-ml changes of the same buffer. A 50% solution of polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8K) was subsequently added to the sample in two steps (first to 8%, then to 18%), and the mixture was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer I and applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (1.5 × 20 cm, 35 ml, Sigma Chemical Co.) that had been pre-equilibrated with 100 ml of 0.5 mTris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 100 ml of buffer I. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer I containing 100 mm NaCl before eluting BsIDH with a linear gradient of 100–250 mm NaCl (150 ml). The pooled fractions were then dialyzed against two 1-liter changes of buffer I, centrifuged, and applied to a pre-equilibrated Affi-Gel Blue (100–200 mesh, Bio-Rad) column (1 × 9 cm, 7.5 ml). BsIDH was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl (150 ml), dialyzed against buffer I, and concentrated to 7–8 mg/ml with a Centricon 10 ultrafiltration apparatus. Purification was monitored throughout the procedure by both isocitrate dehydrogenase assays (see below) and A 280 readings. Final protein concentrations were calculated by the Peterson protocol (23Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), a variation of the Lowry method (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. BsIDH was >98% pure, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). Typically, 1 liter of cells yielded 20 mg of pure protein. BsIDH activities were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the reduction of NADP+to NADPH at 340 nm. The reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm NADP+, 0.50 mmd,l-isocitrate, and 5 mm MgCl2. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 µl of each column fraction or appropriate dilution thereof. The rate was calculated as ΔA 340/min, with an extinction coefficient of 6220 m−1cm−1 for NADPH and a path length of 1 cm. Promising crystallization trials were conducted at 18 °C via hanging drop vapor diffusion in 100 mm citrate buffer (pH 4.8–5.0). Polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4K) was used as the precipitant. Although needle-like crystals grew almost instantaneously, they diffracted to only 4 Å. To reduce the rate of growth, the concentration of PEG 4K was decreased from 30–35% and varying amounts (15–25%) of propylene glycol were added. Rod-shaped crystals (0.8 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm) that consistently diffracted to 2.1–2.5 Å grew within 3 days of standingversus a solution of 100 mm citrate (pH 4.9), 18–23% polyethylene glycol 4000, and 17–20% propylene glycol. The optimal crystals formed in a drop containing 3 µl of protein (7.9 mg/ml) and 3 µl of mother liquor (100 mm citrate (pH 4.9), 23% PEG 4K, 18% propylene glycol). BsIDH crystals belonged to the monoclinic space group P21and had the following unit cell dimensions: a = 73.7 Å, b = 73.3 Å, c = 80.9 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 109°. The presence of a screw axis was confirmed by examining pseudoprecession images and locating systematic absences alongk in both 0kl and hk0 zones. A Matthews' coefficient (25Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7894) Google Scholar),V m, of 2.4 Å3/Da correlated with the presence of two monomers per asymmetric unit. Initial diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a Siemens multiwire area detector using monochromated CuKα radiation generated from a Rigaku RU-200B rotating anode. Processing of raw data was completed with the XENGEN software package (26Howard A. Gilliand G. Finzel B. Poulos T. Ohlendorf D. Salemme F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1978; 20: 383-387Crossref Scopus (571) Google Scholar). X-ray intensities employed for final structure determination were measured at 110 K on a 3 × 3 charge-coupled device area detector using synchrotron radiation at a wavelength of 1.0332 Å on beamline 19-ID of the Advanced Photon Source (Structural Biology Center-CAT; Argonne National Laboratory). The single crystal diffracted to 1.50 Å, and the data are 99.8% complete to 1.69 Å. A total of 244,629 observations and 114,797 unique reflections between 99.0 and 1.50 Å were integrated with the program DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

It was originally assumed, therefore, that the orientation of the two monomers was approximately parallel to the 2-fold screw axis. Initial phases for BsIDH were determined by molecular replacement, as implemented in X-PLOR (30Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1990Google Scholar), employing the monomer form of EcIDH (20; Protein Data Bank code 3ICD) as a search probe. To more closely mimic the B. subtilis enzyme, the following alterations were made to the EcIDH coordinate file after solvent molecules had been removed: 1) the first seven amino acids were deleted since they do not exist in BsIDH; 2) amino acids with similar chemical and/or structural properties in both enzymes (e.g. tyrosine in EcIDH, phenylalanine in BsIDH) were exchanged; and 3) all other nonidentical residues were converted to alanine.

Acta Crystallogr. 1990; A46: 46-57Crossref Scopus (360) Google Scholar) from 10 to 4 Å produced two peaks whose positions were related by the spherical coordinates indicated in the self-rotation function described above. Both of these solutions scored ∼7ς above the mean and 2.5ς above the next highest peak. These peaks were treated as the two monomers (A and B) of the BsIDH dimer. After one subunit was located by the first translation search (32Fuginaga M. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 517-521Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar), utilizing data from 10 to 4 Å, its position was fixed while the position of the second subunit was ascertained. Rigid-body refinement in X-PLOR (30Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1990Google Scholar) was attempted to optimize the molecular replacement solution using data from 8 to 3 Å and an F/ς amplitude cutoff of 2.0. However, it raised the crystallographicR-factor (R cryst) (33Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar) from 44.4% to 51.1%. Analysis of the calculation revealed that the starting van der Waals energy levels were extraordinarily high, suggesting that some atoms in the model were too close. To relieve this strain, an energy level minimization procedure was invoked instead. This reducedR cryst from 44.4% to 40.0% andR free (34Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3839) Google Scholar) from 43.9% to 42.5%. Five percent of the reflections were removed for the test set. A simulated annealing run (35Brünger A.T.

A plot ofR cryst and R free in the resolution range of 8 to 3 Å demonstrated that most of the error was centered on the lower resolution data. This and close inspection of theoretical Luzzati plots (36Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Crossref Google Scholar) pointed to the need for bulk solvent correction (37Jiang J.-S. Brunger A.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 100-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Once applied, R cryst andR free fell to 30.2% and 39.5%, respectively, for data between 20 and 2.5 Å. A single round of positional and individual B-factor refinement, as implemented in X-PLOR (30Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: A System for Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1990Google Scholar), further reduced these values to 26.2% and 37.8%. Model building was performed with the graphics program O (38Jones A.T. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Initial 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ maps contoured at 1ς and incorporating data from 20 to 2.5 Å displayed fairly well-defined electron density for both monomers in the asymmetric unit with the following exceptions. First, amino acids Leu94-Ile102(Leu103-Ile111 in EcIDH), part of the loop between β-strand C and α-helix d (Figs. 1 and 2), were disordered in monomer B, although they resided in contiguous density in monomer A. The significance of this apparent discrepancy is addressed under “Results and Discussion” below. Second, there was no definitive density for the N-terminal methionine or for residues 72–75, 241–275, and 333–340 in either monomer. In fact, strong negative density (−8ς) was covering these latter three areas in a ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ map contoured at 3ς. These segments correspond, respectively, to a 2-amino acid deletion (in and after α-helix b), a 13-amino acid insertion (middle part of α-helices g2/g3), and a two-amino acid insertion (between β-strands D and E) in the BsIDH sequence (see Fig.1). Residues 72–75 (80–84 in EcIDH), 241–275 (250–271 in EcIDH), and 333–340 (329–334 in EcIDH) were consequently removed from the model until positive density could be discerned in future ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ maps. An attempt to apply noncrystallographic symmetry restraints early in refinement resulted in slight increases in bothR cryst and R free. Therefore, the monomers were refined independently. At this juncture, because of difficulties encountered with modeling residues 241–275, including the 13-amino acid insert, data to 1.55 Å with an F/ς amplitude cutoff of 0.0 were incorporated in one step rather than incrementally. This, not surprisingly, raisedR cryst and R free to 45.3% and 47.9%, respectively, from their previous values of 25.2% and 35.7%. Nevertheless, a round of Powell minimization, simulated annealing, positional, and individual B-factor refinement against bulk-solvent-corrected data decreased those figures to 31.1% and 35.1%. Despite the inclusion of all data, however, amino acids 241–275 remained in broken density in both subunits. The noncrystallographic symmetry operator was thus employed to generate averaged 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ maps employing the MAMA (39Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Bailey S. Hubbard R. Waller D. From First Map to Final Model. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1994: 59-66Google Scholar, 40Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and AVE protocols (41Jones T.A. Dodson E.J. Gover S. Wolf W. Molecular Replacement. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, UK1992: 91-105Google Scholar). For both monomers, this resulted in contiguous density for 2–3 residues on either side of the 35-residue gap. The program MAID (42Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 736-745Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was then used to construct 4–6 amino acids per modeling session, and after subsequent reciprocal-space refinement in X-PLOR against bulk-solvent-corrected data, unaveraged maps were utilized to more precisely position these residues. This iterative process continued until all 70 amino acids (35 in each subunit) were properly built into 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ maps (contoured at 1ς) and until no negative or positive peaks remained in ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ maps (contoured at 3ς). Each round of model building and refinement reduced R cryst and R free, yielding more readily interpretable electron density. Solvent molecules were added to the model whenR cryst fell below 28.0%. Placement was aided by the use of a density peak search algorithm in O. Waters were kept only if they met the following criteria: 1) they were present in both 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ maps contoured at 1ς and ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ maps contoured at 3ς; 2) they were 2.5–3.6 Å away from a suitable hydrogen bond donor/acceptor atom; and 3) their temperature factors did not rise above 60 Å2during subsequent refinement. Stereochemical quality of the model was assessed with the program PROCHECK (43Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Comparisons between the two subunits of BsIDH and between BsIDH and the various crystal structures of EcIDH were accomplished with a least-squares approach as implemented in O (38Jones A.T. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and LSQMAN (44Kleywegt G.A. Jones T.A. ESF/CCP 4 Newsletter. 1994; 31: 9-14Google Scholar) and graphically depicted with Kaleidagraph 3.5 Synergy software (45Kaleidagraph Synergy Software. (1996) v. 3.5.Google Scholar). Molecular surface calculations were completed with GRASP (46Sridharan S. Nicolls A. Sharp K. J. Comput. Chem. 1995; 16: 1038-1044Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and structure figures were prepared with SETOR (47Evans S.V. J. Mol. Graphics. 1993; 11: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar) except where noted. Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1HQS. Final cycles of reciprocal-space refinement were completed with alternate rounds of Powell minimization and individual B-factor scaling. By this point, R cryst and R freewere 22.7% and 28.1%, respectively, and 417 out of 423 side chain atoms were in place. However, there were still several regions of unexplained electron density. The first region focused on seven distinct +6ς features positioned throughout the protein, all of which were interpreted as molecules of propylene glycol (ligand numbers 901–907), a constituent of the crystallization medium. The second region, a series of +8ς peaks corresponding to 4 atoms at the tip of Cys118 in both subunits, appears to have resulted from these residues being modified by β-mercaptoethanol (βME), the reducing agent employed during protein purification. (They are designated as CME in the coordinate file instead of CYS to distinguish them from normal -SH cysteines). Note that Cys118 is an active site residue. Nevertheless, as discussed below, the catalytic residues of BsIDH and EcIDH are virtually superimposable. Moreover, prolonged incubation of BsIDH with βME had no detectable effect on IDH activity (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the modification did not drastically perturb the structure. Additional electron density (+6ς to +9ς in ‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ maps) was observed in both active sites, although it was of much stronger intensity and more clearly defined in monomer A. Here, the density was branched and large enough to include 13 atoms. It resembled citrate (ligand number 425) and was modeled as such. The density in monomer B, on the other hand, was only large enough to include six atoms but was modeled as a citrate molecule (ligand number 825). Upon placement and subsequent refinement, 2‖F o‖ − ‖F c‖ density for 10 of 13 atoms appeared. A small negative peak (−3.4ς) on atoms O5 and C6,"

In Chinese hamster ovary transfectants with mhATase, the following parameters were examined: ATase activity and its subunit structure, the metabolic rates of de novo and salvage pathways, DNA and protein synthesis rates, and the rate of cell growth. In mhATase-Tg mice, ATase activity in the liver and spleen, the metabolic rate of the de novopathway in the liver, serum uric acid concentration, urinary excretion of purine derivatives, and T lymphocyte proliferation by phytohemagglutinin were examined. We concluded the following. 1) ATase and its feedback inhibition regulate not only the rate of purinede novo synthesis but also DNA and protein synthesis rates and the rate of cell growth in cultured fibroblasts. 2) Suppression of the de novo pathway by the salvage pathway is mainly due to the feedback inhibition of ATase by purine ribonucleotides produced via the salvage pathway, whereas the suppression of the salvage pathway by the de novo pathway is due to consumption of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate by the de novo pathway. 3) The feedback inhibition of ATase is more important for the regulation of the de novo pathway than that of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate synthetase. 4) ATase superactivity leads to hyperuricemia and an increased bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in T lymphocytes stimulated by phytohemagglutinin.

Amidophosphoribosyltransferase (ATase)1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the de novo pathway of purine ribonucleotide synthesis (1Yamaoka T. Kondo M. Honda S. Iwahana H. Moritani M Ii S. Yoshimoto K. Itakura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17719-17725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and is regulated by feedback inhibition by AMP and GMP. Hypoxanthine (Hx) and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) are the most important substrate and enzyme, respectively, of the salvage pathway (1Yamaoka T. Kondo M. Honda S. Iwahana H. Moritani M Ii S. Yoshimoto K. Itakura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17719-17725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is caused by a complete deficiency of HPRT. Although patients with this syndrome show hyperuricemia with accelerated de novo purine synthesis, the mechanism of activation of the de novo pathway is not fully understood. In a previous study, we demonstrated that the expression level of ATase limits the growth rate of cultured fibroblasts, and purine salvage strongly inhibits purine de novo synthesis (1Yamaoka T. Kondo M. Honda S. Iwahana H. Moritani M Ii S. Yoshimoto K. Itakura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17719-17725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms by which the salvage pathway inhibits the de novopathway were presumed. 1) Consumption of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) by the salvage pathway decreases the activity of the de novo pathway because PRPP is the common source of both pathways. 2) Purine nucleotides synthesized via the salvage pathway inhibit ATase by feedback regulation. However, it is unclear which mechanism plays the more important role. To resolve these questions, feedback-resistant human ATase (hATase) was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in CHO ade−A fibroblasts, an auxotrophic cell line deficient in ATase. In CHO ade −A cells transfected with mutated hATase cDNA (−A + mhATase cells), the following parameters were examined and compared with those in CHO ade −A cells transfected with normal hATase cDNA (−A + hATase cells): ATase activity, the subunit structure of ATase, the metabolic rates of de novo and salvage pathways, the rates of protein and DNA syntheses, and the rate of cell growth. For a comprehensive study, we used, in total, four cell lines: 1) CHO K1, a wild type of CHO fibroblasts, 2) CHO ade −A cells, 3) −A + hATase cells, and 4) −A + mhATase cells. We also used two culture media: 1) a medium rich in purine bases and 2) a medium free of purine bases. In the purine-rich medium, both thede novo and salvage pathways function in CHO K1,−A + hATase, and −A + mhATase cells, but only the salvage pathway functions in CHO ade −A cells. In the purine-free medium, only the de novo pathway functions in CHO K1, −A + hATase, and −A + mhATase cells, and neither of the two pathways functions in CHO ade−A cells. Under various conditions, we examined the effects of feedback regulation of ATase on the cell growth rate and on the biosyntheses of purine nucleotides, DNA, and proteins. Furthermore, we generated transgenic mice expressing mhATase under the control of the CAG promoter (mhATase-Tg mice). Because this promoter functions in most cells, overexpression of mhATase was expected in all tissues of the transgenic mice. In mhATase-Tg mice, the following data were examined: ATase activity in the liver and spleen, the metabolic rate of the de novo pathway in the liver, urinary excretion of allantoin and uric acid (UA), serum UA concentration, and T lymphocyte proliferation by phytohemagglutinin (PHA). In Escherichia coliATase, amino acid replacements of K326Q and P410W result in decreased binding affinity for AMP and GMP and lead to corresponding reductions in feedback inhibition (2Zhou G. Smith J.L. Zalkin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6784-6789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the amino acid sequences of these two regions are conserved in E. coli ATase and hATase, these mutations were expected to make hATase, as well as E. coliATase, feedback-resistant. Using a polymerase chain reaction-based method, a K338Q/P422W double mutation, which corresponds to K326Q/P410W of E. coli ATase, was generated in hATase cDNA, resulting in mhATase cDNA. CHO K1 and CHO ade −A cells (3Oates G. Patterson D. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 561-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were kind gifts from Dr. David Patterson (Eleanor Roosevelt Institute for Cancer Research, Denver, CO). The CHO fibroblasts were cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of humidified air:CO2 (95:5) in Ham's F-12 (HamF) purine-rich medium containing 30 μm Hx + 10‥ fetal calf serum (FCS) or HamF with 10‥ FCS treated with 2.5 mg (1.8 unit)/liter xanthine oxidase (XO) from buttermilk (Sigma) at 37 °C overnight, serving as a Hx-free medium (HamF + XO). The complete removal of Hx in HamF + XO was confirmed first by the disappearance of the Hx peak in the reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis through a C18 column (1Yamaoka T. Kondo M. Honda S. Iwahana H. Moritani M Ii S. Yoshimoto K. Itakura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17719-17725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and second by the absence of growth of CHO ade −A cells in HamF + XO. Although RPMI 1640 + 10‥ dialyzed FCS was also used as a completely purine-free medium, the results obtained from CHO cell culture in this medium were essentially identical to those in HamF + XO containing 10‥ nondialyzed FCS (data not shown). Therefore, adenine and guanine carry-over from nondialyzed FCS was considered to be negligible, and HamF + XO containing 10‥ nondialyzed FCS was used as an essentially purine-free medium in this study. In HamF, both thede novo and salvage pathways function in CHO K1,−A + hATase, and −A + mhATase cells, but only the salvage pathway functions in CHO ade −A cells. In HamF + XO, only the de novo pathway functions in CHO K1,−A + hATase, and −A + mhATase cells, and neither of the two pathways functions in CHO ade −A cells. hATase or mhATase cDNA (2.2 kilobase pairs) was inserted into the cloning site downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter in pBCMGSNeo (14.5 kilobase pairs), which includes the replication origin of bovine papillomavirus leading to 10–500 copies/cell in mammalian cells (4Karasuyama H. Kudo A. Melchers F. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 969-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 5Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4618) Google Scholar). Each plasmid vector (5 μg) was mixed with Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol and overlaid onto CHO ade −A cells (2 × 106cells/90-mm tissue-culture plate) in 5 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After incubation at 37 °C for 6 h in a CO2 incubator, the DNA-containing medium was replaced with 10 ml of HamF containing 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Several clones of −A + hATase and −A + mhATase cells were isolated after G418 selection for 7 days. To select subclones with high ATase activity, these transfectants were further cultured in HamF + XO for several weeks. Long term culture in this purine-free medium positively selected the subclones with high ATase activity associated with a high rate of cell growth. Cultured cells during the logarithmic growth phase were counted by an improved Neubauer hemocytometer (1Yamaoka T. Kondo M. Honda S. Iwahana H. Moritani M Ii S. Yoshimoto K. Itakura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17719-17725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The doubling time (h) was determined from cell counts, and its reciprocal was defined as the cell growth rate. The metabolic rates of the de novo and salvage pathways were determined, respectively, by the incorporation of [14C]glycine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or [3H]Hx (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in acid-soluble purines (1Yamaoka T. Kondo M. Honda S. Iwahana H. Moritani M Ii S. Yoshimoto K. Itakura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17719-17725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a 90-mm culture dish, 2 × 106cells were plated. After the recovery of cell function from plating by 18 h of culture, [14C]glycine or [3H]Hx was added to the medium at the final concentration of 150 μm (0.3 MBq/ml) and 40 μm (0.15 MBq/ml), respectively. The cells were cultured in radioactive medium for 30 min, washed three times with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested with a rubber policeman. Purine nucleotides were extracted from the cells in 1 ml of 0.4n perchloric acid at 100 °C for 60 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, the supernatant was applied to a column (0.5 × 3 cm) of AG-50W-X8 (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 0.1 n HCl. After washing with 5 ml of 1 n HCl, the acid-soluble purines were eluted with 5 ml of 6 n HCl and counted with Aquasol-2 (Packard Instrument Co.) in a scintillation counter. The amount of purines was determined by the absorbance of the eluate at 260 nm. The rates of both purine de novo synthesis and protein synthesis were simultaneously determined by the incorporation of [14C]glycine (6Boss G.R. Erbe R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4242-4247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure the incorporation of [14C]glycine in protein, the acid-insoluble precipitate from the last centrifugation was washed three times in 10‥ trichloroacetic acid and dissolved in 200 μl of 0.3 nNaOH, and the radioactivity was counted with Aquasol-2 in a scintillation counter. The protein concentrations were assayed by Bradford's method (7Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar). The rate of DNA synthesis was determined by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation. In a 90-mm culture dish, 2 × 106 cells were plated. After the recovery of cell function from plating by 18 h of culture, the cells were cultured with 10 μm BrdUrd for 30 min. Incorporated BrdUrd was quantified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysate for enzyme assay was prepared by sonication and centrifugation (1Yamaoka T. Kondo M. Honda S. Iwahana H. Moritani M Ii S. Yoshimoto K. Itakura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17719-17725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To assay ATase activity, the cell lysate was incubated in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 5 mm PRPP (Sigma), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm [14C]glutamine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 5.55 kBq/mmol) at 37 °C for 1 h. Formed [14C]glutamate was separated from [14C]glutamine by high voltage paper electrophoresis at 800 W for 15 min and counted with toluene scintillation mixture in a scintillation counter. The PRPP-dependent hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate was regarded as representing ATase activity (8Itakura M. Holmes E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 333-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the assay solution, ATase was activated by PRPP with the conformational change from tetramer to dimer. Therefore, ATase activity in this study indicates the amount of ATase protein, but not real enzyme activity, in cells. The small active form of hATase is a dimer of subunits, whereas the large inactive form of hATase is a tetramer (9Holmes E.W. Wyngaarden J.B. Kelley W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6035-6040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These two molecular forms of hATase were identified by the retention time of gel filtration by HPLC. The cell lysate prepared for enzyme assay was separated through a TSK-G3000SWXL column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm AMP at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The retention time of hATase was determined by ATase assay of eluate fractions. An expression vector containing the CAG promoter (chicken β-actin promoter with cytomegalovirus enhancer) was a kind gift from Dr. Jun-ich Miyazaki (Department of Nutrition and Physiological Chemistry, Osaka University, Japan). mhATase cDNA was inserted into the cloning site of the expression vector, and a SalI fragment excluding plasmid-derived sequences was microinjected into the male pronuclei of fertilized eggs obtained from superovulated BDF1 (C57BL/6 × DBA/2 F1) female mice crossed with males of the same strain. Injected embryos were implanted into the oviducts of pseudopregnant female mice and allowed to develop (10Yamaoka T. Idehara C. Yano M. Matsushita T. Yamada T. Ii S. Moritani M. Hata J. Sugino H. Noji S. Itakura M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). DNA was extracted from tail snips of live offspring by the proteinase K/SDS method. The integration of the transgene into the mouse genome was detected by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis. The copy numbers of integrated transgenes were determined from the intensity of each radioactive band in Southern blot analysis compared with indicator bands of 1, 10, and 100 copies of the transgene. F1 transgenic progeny were bred by crossing transgenic founder mice with BDF1 mice and used for experiments with sex-matched nontransgenic littermates (wild-type mice) at the age of 15–25 weeks. Body weight was determined every week. Serum UA concentrations of mice were determined by a uricase method with a UA-L kit (Serotec, Sapporo, Japan). Urinary excretions of allantoin, UA, Hx + xanthine, and creatinine were measured by HPLC through two μBondapak C18 columns (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The effluent was monitored at 205 nm, and peak areas of purine derivatives were compared with those of the corresponding standard solutions. Splenocytes (5 × 105 cells/well) obtained from mice of 15–20 weeks of age were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10‥ FCS and 6 μg/ml PHA-L (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a 96-well plate. After 24, 48, and 72 h, BrdUrd incorporation for 6 h was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The data are presented as means ± S.E. For a comparison of two means, Student's paired or unpairedt test was used. A probability value (p) of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Using cell lysates of−A + hATase and −A + mhATase cells, the effects of AMP and GMP on ATase activity were examined. hATase was allosterically inhibited by AMP and GMP, whereas mhATase was resistant to inhibition by AMP and GMP (Fig.1). hATase has two molecular forms: a homodimer and a homotetramer of subunits. hATase activated by PRPP forms the homodimer, whereas hATase inactivated by purine ribonucleotides forms the homotetramer (9Holmes E.W. Wyngaarden J.B. Kelley W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6035-6040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of 10 mm AMP, the molecular form of ATase was analyzed by gel filtration. The retention time of ATase showed that all hATase forms were inactive tetramers, whereas most mhATase forms were active dimers even in the presence of 10 mm AMP (Fig.2). Several clones of−A + hATase and −A + mhATase cells were further cultured in purine-free medium, HamF + XO. Because subclones with high ATase activity proliferate more rapidly than those with low ATase activity, subclones with high ATase activity were gradually selected in the time course of cell culture. As the ATase activity of−A + hATase cells increased, the metabolic rate of thede novo pathway, the synthesis rates of DNA and proteins, and the growth rate also increased in parallel (Fig.3). −A + mhATase cells cultured in HamF + XO also showed similar results (data not shown). These results showed strong links among ATase activity, the metabolic rate of the de novo pathway, the synthesis rates of DNA and proteins, and the cell growth rate. After a 2-week culture, the ATase activities of−A + hATase and −A + mhATase cells increased to the same level as ATase in CHO K1 cells (450–550 cpm/106 cells). When the ATase activity is measuredin vitro, ATase is activated by PRPP at the maximal level. Therefore, the ATase activity indicates the amount of ATase protein in cells but not the actual ATase activity in vivo. Using−A + hATase, −A + mhATase, and CHO K1 cells with the same ATase levels, the mutual regulation of the de novo and salvage pathways was analyzed. The metabolic rate of the de novo pathway in CHO K1 cells under conditions where only the de novo pathway was functioning in HamF + XO was 5 times higher than that under conditions where both purine biosynthetic pathways were functioning in HamF, i.e.the salvage pathway strongly suppresses the de novo pathway down to 20‥ of the initial value (TableI). −A + hATase cells also showed a similar result. In contrast, in −A + mhATase cells, the suppression of the de novo pathway by the salvage pathway was only 16‥, and the metabolic rate of the de novopathway in HamF was 16 times higher than that in CHO K1 cells. These findings indicate that the suppression of the de novopathway by the salvage pathway was primarily due to feedback inhibition of ATase by purine ribonucleotides produced through the salvage pathway. Moreover, even in HamF + XO, the metabolic rate of thede novo pathway in −A + mhATase cells was 3.8 times higher than that in CHO K1 cells, indicating that AMP and GMP produced through the de novo pathway also inhibit ATase in a negative feedback loop in vivo.Table IMetabolic rates of de novo and salvage pathways of four cell lines Open table in a new tab The metabolic rate of the salvage pathway in CHO K1 cells under the conditions where both pathways were functioning in HamF was only 13‥ less than that under the conditions where only the salvage pathway in CHO ade −A cells was functioning in HamF (Table I). A similar result was obtained in −A + hATase cells. In−A + mhATase cells, however, the metabolic rate of the salvage pathway was strongly suppressed by the de novopathway in HamF. The contributions of ATase to various biosyntheses are represented as the rates of biosyntheses relative to the ATase level (Table II). The contributions of ATase to biosyntheses in −A + hATase and −A + mhATase cells were compared, and the contributions of feedback regulation of ATase to these biosyntheses are represented as the ratio of the contributions of hATase and mhATase to the biosyntheses (mhATase/hATase ratio). The contributions of hamster ATase in CHO K1 cells to the biosyntheses were similar to those of hATase in−A + hATase cells (Table II).Table IIContributions of ATase and its feedback regulation to various biosynthesesContribution to purine de novo synthesisCulture mediumDe novo synthesis/hamster ATaseDe novo synthesis/hATaseDe novosynthesis/mhATasemhATase/hATase ratioHamF32.4 ± 3.837.1 ± 4.1500.9 ± 42.513.5HamF + XO157.3 ± 13.9163.1 ± 20.9596.5 ± 67.53.7Contribution to protein synthesisCulture mediumProtein synthesis/hamster ATaseProtein synthesis/hATaseProtein synthesis/ mhATasemhATase/hATase ratioHamF43.4 ± 3.948.6 ± 4.188.6 ± 5.91.8HamF + XO39.8 ± 5.145.7 ± 2.973.0 ± 7.51.6Contribution to DNA synthesisCulture mediumDNA synthesis/hamster ATaseDNA synthesis/hATaseDNA synthesis/mhATasemhATase/hATase ratioHamF0.017 ± 0.0020.019 ± 0.0020.075 ± 0.0103.9HamF + XO0.016 ± 0.0020.015 ± 0.0040.053 ± 0.0093.5 Open table in a new tab The contribution of hATase to purine de novo synthesis in HamF was smaller than that in Ham F + XO (37.1 versus 163.1) because the salvage pathway inhibits the de novo pathway in HamF (Table II). Therefore, the contribution of the feedback regulation to purine de novo synthesis in HamF was greater than that in HamF + XO (13.5 versus 3.7). In hamster ATase, hATase, and mhATase, the contributions of ATase to protein and DNA syntheses in HamF were modestly larger than those in HamF + XO, although the differences are not statistically significant (Table II). These findings indicate that the de novo pathway alone in HamF + XO can supply almost all purine nucleotides necessary for protein and DNA syntheses, and the additional effect of the salvage pathway in HamF is trivial. The contributions of mhATase to protein and DNA syntheses were, respectively, 1.6–1.8 and 3.5–3.9 times higher than those of hATase, suggesting that the feedback inhibition of ATase also regulates protein and DNA syntheses in cultured fibroblasts. −A + hATase and −A + mhATase cells were cultured in HamF + XO for several weeks. When their ATase levels reached maximum plateau values (about 3 times the ATase level of CHO K1 cells), their maximal growth rates were determined in HamF and compared with the growth rates of CHO K1 and CHO ade −A cells (Table III). The maximal growth rates of−A + hATase and −A + mhATase cells were higher than those of CHO K1 cells. In particular, the doubling time of−A + mhATase cells was shortened to 6.0 h by long term culture for more than 8 weeks. To our knowledge, −A + mhATase cells grow at the highest rate of all cultured mammalian cells investigated. These results show that ATase and its feedback inhibition regulate the growth rate of cultured fibroblasts.Table IIIGrowth of CHO fibroblastsCultured cellsCulture mediumDoubling timeGrowth rateh10−2 /hCHO ade−AHamF23.8 ± 0.24.2CHO K1HamF + XO16.5 ± 0.16.1CHO K1HamF15.1 ± 0.26.6−A + hATaseHamF10.1 ± 0.19.9−A + mhATaseHamF6.0 ± 0.116.7 Open table in a new tab The growth rate of CHO K1 cells in HamF + XO was higher (6.1versus 4.2) than that of CHO ade −A cells in HamF, i.e. the contribution of the de novopathway to the growth rate was greater than that of the salvage pathway (Table III). The additional contribution of the salvage pathway to the growth rate was also small (from 6.1 to 6.6). We obtained nine founders of mhATase-Tg mice. The number of transgene copies in these transgenic mice ranged from 5 to 100. In expectation of high level mhATase expression, two founder mice with high copy numbers of more than 50 were bred, and their F1 mice were used in this study. Body weights measured weekly were similar in both lines of transgenic mice and wild-type mice at least up to 25 weeks of age. In mhATase-Tg mice, liver ATase activity (1.8-fold), spleen ATase activity (1.6-fold), the metabolic rate of the de novo pathway in the liver (1.8-fold), urinary excretion of allantoin + UA normalized to creatinine excretion (1.5-fold), and serum UA concentration (1.5-fold) were significantly higher than these values in wild-type mice (Figs. 4 and 5).Figure 5Urinary excretion of purine derivatives. a, standard solution; b, a wild-type mouse; andc, an mhATase-Tg mouse. Under the chromatographic conditions in this study, Hx and xanthine were not separated, and the peak of Hx + xanthine was not detected in mouse urine. Therefore, the urinary excretion of allantoin + UA was regarded as the urinary excretion of total purine derivatives and was normalized to creatinine excretion (Fig. 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) T lymphocytes in mouse splenocytes were stimulated by PHA. After 48 and 72 h, BrdUrd incorporation by T lymphocytes in mhATase-Tg mice was significantly greater than that in wild-type mice (Fig.6). In the presence of 10 mm AMP, hATase formed inactive tetramers, whereas most mhATase remained in the active dimeric form, i.e. mhATase was resistant to a conformational change induced by AMP. A minor part of the mhATase was in tetrameric form. This tetramer may be a complex of mhATase subunits and hamster ATase subunits inactivated by a mutation in CHO ade −A cells because hamster ATase was always found in the form of tetramers, even in the presence of PRPP, and because the less common tetrameric forms of hATase and mhATase were detected along with the major dimeric forms in the presence of PRPP (data not shown). 2T. Yamaoka and M. Itakura, unpublished data. Purine nucleotides are synthesized preferentially by the salvage pathway as long as hypoxanthine is available, with concomitant inhibition of thede novo pathway for sparing the energy expenditure required for de novo synthesis (1Yamaoka T.

Honda S. Miwa Y. Katashima R. Moritani M. Yoshimoto K. Hayashi Y. Itakura M. J. Biochem. 2000; 128: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In −A + mhATase cells, the suppression of the de novo pathway by the salvage pathway was strongly inhibited even in the presence of sufficient Hx in HamF. Therefore, the mechanism by which the salvage pathway suppresses the de novo pathway was shown to be mainly due to the feedback inhibition of ATase rather than to the consumption of PRPP, the common substrate of both pathways. From these results, the mechanism of the accelerated de novo pathway in patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome can also be explained as follows: AMP and GMP produced through the salvage pathway decrease because of complete HPRT deficiency; decreased AMP and GMP reduce the feedback inhibition of ATase, and activated ATase increases the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides. Indeed, primary cultured astroglia from HPRT-deficient mice showed reduced levels of intracellular purine ribonucleotides with a 9.4-fold acceleration of de novopurine synthesis (12Pelled D. Sperling O. Zoref-Shani E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Even under conditions where only the de novo pathway functions without the suppression by the salvage pathway, mhATase activated the de novo pathway by a factor of 3.7–3.8. Therefore, it was first demonstrated in cultured cells that purine ribonucleotides produced through the de novopathway inhibit ATase in a negative feedback loop. In addition to the activation of the de novopathway, mhATase also strongly suppressed the salvage pathway. The suppression of the salvage pathway by the de novo pathway is probably due to consumption of PRPP by the de novo pathway because the activity of the de novo pathway has no effect on HPRT expression (1Yamaoka T. Kondo M. Honda S. Iwahana H. Moritani M Ii S. Yoshimoto K. Itakura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17719-17725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and HPRT is not regulated by the feedback inhibition. Indeed, a large consumption of PRPP by de novosynthesis is suggested by the 16-fold increase in PRPP concentration in human leukemia cells treated with 6-methylmercaptopurine riboside to inhibit de novo synthesis (13Shi R.Z. Lyons S.D. Christopherson R.I. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 885-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), whereas the primary cultured astroglia from HPRT-deficient mice showed only a 27.8‥ increase in intracellular PRPP level (12Pelled D. Sperling O. Zoref-Shani E. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1139-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition to the acceleration of purine de novo synthesis, mhATase also increased the rates of DNA and protein syntheses and of cell growth, suggesting that ATase and its feedback inhibition regulate the growth rate via the rates of DNA and protein syntheses. We previously reported that purinede novo synthesis is a determinant of intracellular ATP concentration and promotes G1 to S phase transition in the cell cycle, i.e. the initiation of DNA synthesis (11Kondo M. Yamaoka T. Honda S. Miwa Y. Katashima R. Moritani M. Yoshimoto K. Hayashi Y. Itakura M. J. Biochem. 2000; 128: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, ATase and its feedback inhibition probably regulate DNA and protein syntheses through ATP production. Surprisingly, the minimum doubling time of −A + mhATase cells was as short as only 6.0 h, thus representing one of the most rapidly growing cell types. This result also indicates the great contribution of ATase and its feedback inhibition to regulating the growth rate of cultured fibroblasts. In transgenic mice expressing normal hATase, the acceleration of purine de novo synthesis cannot be expected because of the feedback inhibition of hATase. Indeed, −A + hATase cells with an ATase level twice that of CHO K1 cells showed only a 1.2-fold increase in the rate of purine de novo synthesis (1Yamaoka T. Kondo M. Honda S. Iwahana H. Moritani M Ii S. Yoshimoto K. Itakura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17719-17725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, mhATase was used to generate transgenic mice in this study. In mhATase-Tg mice, increases in ATase levels in the liver (1.8-fold) and spleen (1.6-fold) were comparable to the increase in the metabolic rate of the de novo pathway (1.8-fold). Furthermore, ATase activities in the liver and spleen of mhATase-Tg mice were resistant to inhibition by AMP (data not shown). These results suggest that mhATase is primarily expressed in mhATase-Tg mice, and the endogenous expression of mouse ATase is suppressed. Normal ATase protein may have a short half-life in the presence of excessive mhATase, whereas mhATase may also be resistant to protein degradation. mhATase-Tg mice also showed increases in serum UA concentration and urinary excretion of allantoin + UA. These findings suggest that the superactivity of ATase leads to hyperuricemia in humans, although the germline mutation of the human ATase gene has not been reported. Purinede novo synthesis is also regulated by the feedback inhibition of PRPP synthetase, and the superactivity of this enzyme by point mutations results in hyperuricemia and gout (14Becker M.A. Smith R.R. Taylor W. Mustafi R. Switzer R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Both in−A + mhATase cells and in mhATase-Tg mice, the feedback regulation of PRPP synthetase by purine ribonucleotides was intact, but the acceleration of the de novo pathway was not suppressed by the feedback regulation of PRPP synthetase. This indicates that the feedback inhibition of ATase is more important for the regulation of the de novo pathway than that of PRPP synthetase and that PRPP synthetase indirectly regulates the de novo pathway via ATase activation by producing PRPP. Indeed, the studies using fibroblasts from patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and with PRPP synthetase superactivity supported the following concepts. 1) The rate of purine de novo synthesis is regulated at both PRPP synthetase and ATase reactions, and the latter reaction is more sensitive to small changes in purine ribonucleotide concentrations. 2) PRPP is a major regulator of the purine synthesis rate because it is a determinant of ATase activity. 3) Activation of ATase by PRPP is nearly maximal at baseline in fibroblasts with PRPP synthetase superactivity (15Becker M.A. Kim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14531-14537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Resting human T lymphocytes are reported to meet their metabolic demands via the salvage pathway, whereas intact de novo synthesis is essential for the proliferation of PHA-stimulated T lymphocytes (16Fairbanks L.D. Bofill M. Rückemann K. Simmonds H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29682-29689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Even in patients with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, the proliferation of T lymphocytes in response to mitogenic and antigenic stimulation was normal (17Allison A.C. Hovi T. Watts R.W. Webster A.D. Lancet. 1975; 7936: 1179-1183Abstract Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, in leukocytes from two gouty patients affected with a partial deficiency of HPRT, de novo synthesis was accelerated to more than 13 times that of normal controls (18Brosh S. Boer P. Kupfer B. de Vries A. Sperling O. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that the large capacity of purine de novo synthesis can compensate for the defect in the salvage pathway. In mhATase-Tg mice, T lymphocytes stimulated by PHA proliferated more rapidly than those in wild-type mice. The rate of purine de novo synthesis may determine the growth rate of T lymphocytes under mitogen stimulation. Indeed, severe immunological abnormalities are induced by deficiencies in enzymes of purine nucleotide metabolism such as adenosine deaminase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Recently, methotrexate, an immunosuppressive agent, has been viewed as the drug of choice in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Low dose methotrexate inhibits ATase and mitogen-induced expansion of ATP and GTP pools in human T lymphocytes and induces cell arrest at the G1 phase, thus exerting immunosuppressive effects (19Fairbanks L.D.

Christopherson R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11038-11045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, the following concepts are supported by this study using CHO transfectants with mhATase and mhATase-Tg mice. First, ATase and its feedback inhibition regulate not only the rate of purine de novo synthesis but also DNA and protein synthesis rates and the growth rate in cultured fibroblasts. Second, the suppression of thede novo pathway by the salvage pathway is primarily due to the feedback inhibition of ATase by purine ribonucleotides produced through the salvage pathway, whereas the suppression of the salvage pathway by the de novo pathway is due to the consumption of PRPP by the de novo pathway. Third, the feedback inhibition of ATase is more important for the regulation of the de novopathway than that of PRPP synthetase, and PRPP synthetase indirectly regulates the de novo pathway via ATase activation by producing PRPP. Finally, ATase superactivity leads to hyperuricemia and increases BrdUrd incorporation in T lymphocytes stimulated by PHA. Understanding the regulation of purine synthetic pathways and their relationship to DNA and protein syntheses and cell growth is useful for various medical applications such as developing therapies for malignant neoplasms and autoimmune diseases."

Like other ATP-binding cassette proteins, TAP uses ATP hydrolysis to power transport. We have studied peptide binding to as well as translocation by TAP proteins with mutations in the Walker A and B sequences that are known to mediate ATP binding and hydrolysis. We show that a mutation in the TAP1 Walker B sequence reported to abrogate class I expression by a lung tumor does not affect ATP binding affinity, suggesting a defect restricted to ATP hydrolysis. This mutation reduces peptide transport by only 50%, suggesting that TAP function can be highly limiting for antigen presentation in non-lymphoid cells. Single substitutions in Walker A sequences (TAP1K544A, TAP2K509A), or their complete replacements, abrogate nucleotide binding to each subunit. Although all of these mutations abrogate peptide transport, they reveal distinct roles for nucleotide binding to the two transporter subunits in TAP folding and in regulation of peptide substrate affinity, respectively. Alteration of the TAP1 Walker A motif can have strong effects on TAP1 and thereby TAP complex folding. However, TAP1 Walker A mutations compatible with correct folding do not affect peptide binding. In contrast, abrogation of the TAP2 nucleotide binding capacity has little or no effect on TAP folding but eliminates peptide binding to TAP at 37 °C in the presence of nucleotides. Thus, nucleotide binding to TAP2 but not to TAP1 is a prerequisite for peptide binding to TAP. Based on these results, we propose a model in which nucleotide and peptide release from TAP are coupled and followed by ATP binding to TAP2, which induces high peptide affinity and initiates the transport cycle.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). All ABC transporters possess two transmembrane domains, each generally composed of six membrane-spanning segments, and two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) with primary sequence homology across the protein family. Whereas substrate interaction is generally thought to involve the transmembrane domains, the NBDs bind and hydrolyze ATP. Both of the latter events have been shown to lead to conformational changes that upon transmission to substrate binding domains in an undefined fashion result in substrate translocation (2Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the important role of ABC transporters in diseases such as mucoviscidosis or cancer, the mechanism of substrate transport has been subject to intense scrutiny. Mutagenesis studies and crystallographic analysis of HisP and MalK, the NBDs of bacterial histidine and maltose transporters, respectively, have elucidated the role of several conserved sequence motifs contained in ABC transporter NBDs (3Diederichs K. Diez J. Greller G. Muller C. Breed J. Schnell C. Vonrhein C. Boos W. Welte W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5951-5961Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 4Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Thus, the Walker A consensus sequence (5Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4269) Google Scholar), also termed P-loop, engages in limited interactions with the ATP adenine ring and extensive interactions with its β- and γ-phosphates whereas the less conserved Walker B motif is likely to be involved in attacking the γ-phosphate bond during MgATP hydrolysis. Consequently, substitutions in the Walker sequences generally impair ATP hydrolysis and transporter function partly or completely (2Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several models have been formulated that link ATP metabolism to substrate transport (2Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These models generally postulate that, depending on the nature of the bound nucleotide, NBDs can assume at least three states: an ATP-associated state, followed by a short-lived transition state with ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) bound, and an ADP-bound state. Transition from one state to the next is thought to be coupled to re-orientation of the corresponding substrate binding site and/or a change in substrate affinity. ATP metabolism by the two NBDs of an ABC transporter is generally believed to be linked in an allosteric fashion, as mutations in one NBD affect ATP processing by the other NBD, at least in most cases. Indirect evidence suggests that ATP metabolism by some ABC transporters proceeds in an alternating fashion, such that only one NBD at a time hydrolyzes ATP. This conclusion is mainly based on ℌvanadate trappingℍ experiments in which only one of the two NBDs of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a drug efflux pump overexpressed in many tumors, can be ℌfrozenℍ in the ADP–Pi bound transition state (6Senior A.E. Gadsby D.C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that LmrA, a bacterial analog of P-gp, also uses a ℌtwo cylinder engineℍ model and elegantly provide evidence on how orientation and affinity of the (in this case presumably two) substrate binding sites change during the catalytic cycle (7van Veen H.W. Margolles A. Muller M. Higgins C.F. Konings W.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2503-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Whereas the P-gp NBDs are thought to metabolize ATP in an alternating but otherwise identical fashion (8Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), recent evidence suggests that other ABC transporters may have assigned distinct roles to the two NBDs. Thus, the multidrug resistance protein (MRP1), an organic anion exporter also transporting many anti-cancer drugs, appears to hydrolyze ATP preferentially or initially after substrate binding at its NBD2 (9Gao M.

Among several interpretations of these non-equivalent roles of the MRP1 NBDs, the hypothesis that nucleotide binding to NBD1 may regulate nucleotide hydrolysis by NBD2 is noteworthy (9Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13098-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). TAP1 and TAP2 form a heterodimeric complex in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum and proximal Golgi that provides antigenic peptides to newly synthesized and assembling MHC class I molecules (12Elliott T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 47-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TAP is essential for MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation, as demonstrated by absent or low MHC class I expression in TAP-deficient mice and cell lines (13Spies T. Demars R. Nature. 1991; 351: 323-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Tumor cell lines frequently show impaired TAP expression and/or function, underlining the key role of TAP in MHC class I-mediated immune surveillance and prevention of tumor growth (14Algarra I. Cabrera T. Garrido F. Hum. Immunol. 2000; 61: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Several herpes virus proteins block TAP function, presumably through different mechanisms involving conformational change (15Tortorella D. Gewurz B.E. Furman M.H. Schust D.J. Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 861-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Thus, diminution or loss of TAP function plays a role in the pathogenesis of viral and malignant diseases. These perturbations of TAP function may be related to mutations or protein interactions interfering with ATP metabolism; indeed, a case of a human lung tumor with impaired TAP function because of a mutation in the Walker B region has been described (16Chen H.L. Gabrilovich D. Tampe R. Girgis K.R. Nadaf S. Carbone D.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Little is known on ATP metabolism by the TAP transporters. ATP hydrolysis is required for peptide transport by TAP (17Neefjes J.J. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Science. 1993; 261: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). We have recently described that at 37 °C, microsomal TAP requires stabilization by nucleotide di- or triphosphates to maintain a conformation with high substrate affinity (18van Endert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14632-14638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, Knittleret al.(19) reported that substitutions in the TAP Walker A sequences not only abolished peptide binding to, and transport by, TAP but also inhibited the physiological dissociation of peptide-assembled MHC class I molecules from TAP. In this study, we used an insect cell expression system to study substrate interaction with TAP proteins carrying mutations in Walker A and B sequences. Our results shed light on the nucleotide requirements for TAP folding and for peptide binding and transport and suggest that the NBDs of TAP1 and TAP2 fulfill distinct functions in the catalytic TAP cycle. Baculoviruses encoding human wild type (wt) TAP1.A and TAP2.A proteins with mutations in the Walker sequences were produced by oligonucleotide-directed ℌloop outℍ mutagenesis on uracil-enriched single-stranded DNA as described previously (20Daniel S. Caillat-Zucman S. Hammer J. Bach J.F. van Endert P.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2350-2357PubMed Google Scholar). cDNAs containing the desired mutations, confirmed by sequencing, were cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and co-transfected with BaculoGold™ (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) virus DNA into Sf9 insect cells to produce recombinant viruses as described previously (20Daniel S. Caillat-Zucman S. Hammer J. Bach J.F. van Endert P.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2350-2357PubMed Google Scholar). Insect cell microsomes expressing mutant TAP proteins were produced by sucrose gradient fractionation of mechanically lysed infected Sf9 cells according to previously published procedures (21van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.-F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A mixture of protease inhibitors was added before insect cell lysis (chymostatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, aprotinin, and leupeptin; see Ref. 20Daniel S. Caillat-Zucman S. Hammer J. Bach J.F. van Endert P.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2350-2357PubMed Google Scholar for details). TAP function was evaluated in peptide binding and transport assays performed exactly as described previously, using 125I-labeled reporter peptides R-9-L (RRYNASTEL) and R-10-T (RYWANATRST) for binding and transport assays, respectively (20Daniel S. Caillat-Zucman S. Hammer J. Bach J.F. van Endert P.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2350-2357PubMed Google Scholar). In preincubation experiments, microsomes (15–30 μl in 150 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiotreitol, and 2 mm MgCl2) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, cooled to 0 °C in a water/ice bath, pelleted (20,000 × g for 5 min), resuspended in 150 μl of assay buffer, and used in a standard binding assay. These experiments were also performed as described previously by us (18van Endert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14632-14638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Lauvau G. Gubler B. Cohen H. Daniel S. Caillat-Zucman S. van Endert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31349-31358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 30-μl (for vesicles prepared up to three months prior to the experiment) or 60-μl microsomes (for older vesicles) were lysed in a total volume of 600 μl using Nonidet P-40, and TAP complexes were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody (mAb) 148.3 specific for human TAP1 (23Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampé R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Proteins blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were visualized with mAbs 148.3 or 429.3 (anti-TAP2) and a standard enhanced chemiluminescence protocol. For flow cytometric analysis, Sf9 cells were infected with TAP1 and TAP2 viruses, both at a multiplicity of infection of 6, together with a virus encoding HLA-B27 and human β2-microglobulin at a multiplicity of infection of 3. Viruses coding for two unrelated proteins, 65-kDa glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and IA-2, the intracellular fragment of a tyrosine phosphatase, were used in control infections for cytometric analysis (24Bach J.M. Otto H. Nepom G.T. Jung G. Cohen H. Timsit J. Boitard C. van Endert P.M. J. Autoimmun. 1997; 10: 375-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 40 h after infection and stained for cell surface expression of HLA-B27 with mAbs B27.M1 and W6/32. Dead cells staining with propidium iodide were excluded from analysis. 5 × 106 Sf9 cells were infected with one or two TAP viruses, each at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and incubated for 72 h before harvesting. Pelleted cells were lysed for 40 min at 4 °C in 750 μl of a 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100. After lysate clarification by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 40 min), 75–250 μl of lysate (corresponding to 0.5–1.6 × 106 cells) was diluted to 300 μl and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 50 μl of packed ATP-agarose beads (11 atom spacer, Sigma-Aldrich, St.-Quentin, France) in the presence or absence of ATP or ADP. Then beads were washed three times with 1 ml of the same buffer, with 0.5% Triton X-100, and finally resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. 7 μl were then loaded on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels, and precipitated TAP proteins were detected by Western blot analysis using mAb 148.3 and 429.3, as described above. To study the role of nucleotides for TAP function, TAP proteins with mutant Walker sequences were designed and expressed in the Sf9 insect cell/baculovirus system. Mutants included single residue substitutions as well as complete replacement or deletion of Walker A sequences (Table I). Point substitutions in the Walker A motif were designed according to published studies. Substitution of the highly conserved Lys residue (mutants T1K544A and T2K509A), and of the amino-terminal Gly residue (mutant T1G538Q) have been reported to abrogate ATP hydrolysis and in some cases also binding by different ABC transporters (2Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 26Szabo K. Welker E.

In HisP, the corresponding residues interact directly with each other, and the Lys residue forms several hydrogen bonds with the β-phosphate of ATP (4Hung L.W. Wang I.X. Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Inversion of the carboxyl-terminal Ser-Thr residues (mutants T1ST545/6TS and T2ST510/1TS) has been reported to enhance efficiency of MgATP utilization by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (25Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Finally, mutation T1R659Q corresponds to a natural mutation in the TAP1 Walker B motif previously identified in a human small cell lung cancer line and was described to be associated with a TAP-deficient cell phenotype (16Chen H.L. Gabrilovich D. Tampe R. Girgis K.R. Nadaf S. Carbone D.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Replacements of entire Walker A motifs by synthetic linker peptides (mutants T1Rep and T2Rep), or complete Walker A deletions (mutants T1Del and T2Del) were included to study TAP proteins highly likely to be unable to hydrolyze and bind ATP.Table ISequence of TAP Walker motifs and mutationsMutantSequence1-aIdentity (–), deletion (*).T1wt, T2wtPNGSGKSTT1K544A, T2K509AAT1ST545/6TS, T2ST510/1TSTST1G538QQT1RepTHASSSAHAT2RepTQASASAQAT1Del, T2Del*********T1wtRALIRKPCVLILDT1R659QQ1-a Identity (–), deletion (*). Open table in a new tab Recombinant baculoviruses containing mutant TAP cDNAs were generated, and expression and assembly of TAP proteins were studied in Western blotting and immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig.1). All mutant TAP1 and TAP2 proteins were expressed and migrated as expected in SDS-PAGE gels. However, whereas most mutant TAP subunits were overexpressed to a similar extent as wild-type TAP1 and TAP2, only small amounts of mutant TAP1 subunit T1Del could be immunoprecipitated, and recovery of mutant T1G538Q was also reduced. Reduced levels of immunoprecipitable T1Del and T1G538Q proteins reflected reduced levels of mutant proteins in microsome lysates prepared using Nonidet P-40 (see below); however, relatively large amounts of these subunits were detected in microsome ℌdebrisℍ that could not be solubilized in Nonidet P-40 (not shown). This suggested that mutants T1Del and T1G538Q folded inefficiently and formed insoluble aggregates. Nevertheless, even in these cases, immunoprecipitable material, presumably corresponding to the correctly folded fractions, assembled efficiently in heteromeric TAP complexes, as indicated by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1). Thus, none of the mutations had an adverse effect on assembly with wild-type complementary subunits. To analyze the effect of the mutations on TAP transport function, insect cells expressing mutant TAP subunits together with wild-type complementary subunits were produced and tested in two assays. One of these evaluates accumulation of a glycosylated radiolabeled peptide in microsomes (17Neefjes J.J. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Science. 1993; 261: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), whereas the other uses appearance of HLA-B27 molecules on the surface of infected insect cells as a readout for TAP function. We have previously shown that insect cell-expressed B27 molecules are loaded with TAP-supplied peptides in the absence of other human accessory molecules, notably tapasin, and that cell surface expression in the Sf9 insect cell system reflects intracellular peptide loading of HLA-B27 (22Lauvau G. Gubler B. Cohen H. Daniel S. Caillat-Zucman S. van Endert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31349-31358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed peptide loading of HLA-B27 as an additional and physiologically relevant readout for TAP function. Moreover, because tapasin-independent loading of B27 with TAP-supplied peptides is likely to be related to the exceptionally high compatibility between TAP and B27 peptide preferences (28Daniel S. Brusic V. Caillat-Zucman S. Petrovsky N. Harrison L. Riganelli D. Sinigaglia F. Gallazzi F. Hammer J. van Endert P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 617-624PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that this assay might also provide information on potential changes in TAP selectivity resulting from mutations. As expected, substitutions T1K544A, T1G538Q, and T2K509A, as well as Walker A replacements and deletions in either TAP subunit, abolished accumulation of glycosylated peptide in the ER, whereas control mutation T2ST510/1TS did not affect the rate of peptide accumulation and T1ST545/6TS increased it (Fig. 2). Thus, ATP binding to and/or hydrolysis by both NBDs is required for peptide transport by TAP. Moreover, similar to the CFTR (25Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), mutation T1ST545/6TS may enhance efficiency of ATP hydrolysis by TAP1. Surprisingly, mutation T1R659Q, reported to create a TAP-deficient cell phenotype (16Chen H.L. Gabrilovich D. Tampe R. Girgis K.R. Nadaf S. Carbone D.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), reduced peptide accumulation by about 50% rather than abolishing it. ATP-independent peptide accumulation after prolonged microsome incubation at 37 °C is likely to reflect vesicle ℌleakiness.ℍ ADP, which is known to act as a competitor for ATP in ABC transporters (25Anderson M.P. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), reduced peptide accumulation in microsomes expressing wild-type TAP or control mutations (ST to TS inversion) to levels below those observed without addition of nucleotides. This may indicate that ADP competed with ATP carried over in microsome purification for binding to the TAP NBDs. Analysis of HLA-B27 expression confirmed results obtained in transport assays (Fig. 3). In accordance with our previous observation (22Lauvau G. Gubler B. Cohen H. Daniel S. Caillat-Zucman S. van Endert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31349-31358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), B27 was not detectable on the surface of insect cells expressing HLAB27/β2-m together with the two unrelated control proteins GAD and IA-2 (mean fluorescence 5). Co-expression of wild-type TAP complexes induced B27 expression by about 50% of the cells (mean 21). Expression was limited to 50% because cells were infected with a low multiplicity of infection of the B27/β2-m virus together with a high multiplicity of infection of TAP viruses to ensure TAP expression by all B27-expressing cells. Whereas control mutations (ST to TS inversions) increased B27 expression to the same extent as wild-type TAP (means of 20), TAP mutants abolishing peptide transport had no significant effect on its cell surface density (means between 6 and 7). Importantly, mutation T1R659Q displayed about 50% of the effect of wild-type TAP (mean 14). Thus, TAP-mediated peptide supply to HLA-B27 also required ATP binding to and/or hydrolysis by both TAP subunits and was reduced but not abolished by the Walker B mutation described to eliminate HLA class I expression on the surface of a tumor cell line. Peptide transport is preceded by a high affinity interaction of peptide with the TAP substrate binding site, which can be measured in a binding assay performed at low temperature (21van Endert P.M. Tampé R. Meyer T.H. Tisch R. Bach J.-F. McDevitt H.O. Immunity. 1994; 1: 491-500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that wild-type TAP complexes incubated at 37 °C in the absence of nucleotide di- or triphosphates change conformation and lose the ability to bind peptide with high affinity (18van Endert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14632-14638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have therefore proposed that low TAP affinity for peptide substrate characterizes a ℌnucleotide-offℍ conformation that may be related albeit not identical to a transition state associated with peptide release during the transport cycle. Here we asked how Walker motif mutations impairing nucleotide binding and/or hydrolysis affect peptide binding to TAP at different temperatures. In standard peptide binding assays with TAP-expressing vesicles not exposed to temperatures above 27 °C (the temperature used for insect cell culture), microsomes expressing TAP complexes with deletion of the Walker A sequence in either TAP subunit consistently showed very low but significant peptide binding. This binding exceeded binding to control vesicles expressing TAP1 by a factor of 10–15 (Fig.4). Microsomes expressing mutant T1G538Q also consistently displayed significantly reduced peptide binding capacity. Peptide binding to mutant T2Rep was moderately reduced, whereas other TAP1 mutants, including those with Walker A replacement, bound normal peptide amounts. When microsomes were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C prior to binding assays, all TAP complexes lost binding capacity (Fig.5). This included complexes composed of two mutant subunits, for example T1Rep/T2Rep or T1K544A/T2K509A (not shown). Thus, ATP hydrolysis was not required for loss of high affinity peptide binding by TAP. Addition of ATP or ADP during incubations at 37 °C preserved peptide binding capacity by some but not all TAP complexes containing mutated subunits. TAP1 mutations T1Del and T1G538Q abolished TAP complex stabilization by ATP. Complexes containing other TAP1 mutations, including mutation T1Rep, retained peptide binding capacity in the presence of ATP or ADP to a similar extent as wild-type TAP complexes. However, complexes with similar (T2Rep) or identical (T2K509A) mutations in TAP2 did not retain peptide binding capacity in the presence of nucleotides. This suggested that binding of nucleotide di- or triphosphates to TAP2 is essential for maintaining TAP peptide binding capacity whereas nucleotide binding to TAP1 is not. Moreover, TAP1 mutants prone to aggregation also could not be stabilized by nucleotides. To provide direct evidence for the role of nucleotide binding, as opposed to hydrolysis, for peptide binding to TAP, we measured the binding affinity of mutant TAP subunits for ATP immobilized on agarose beads (Fig. 6). Initially, we studied ATP binding of isolated or co-expressed wild-type TAP subunits (Fig.6 A). ATP binding of isolated wild-type TAP1 was efficient and inhibited with equal efficiency by ADP and ATP but not AMP. In contrast, isolated TAP2 subunits showed relatively low levels of Nonidet P-40 soluble material, and ATP binding was hardly detectable. This suggested that isolated TAP2 folded poorly and that correctly folded isolated TAP2 bound ATP poorly. Co-expression of the two wild-type subunits had no effect on the efficiency of TAP1 binding to ATP but induced a significant increase in the amount of Nonidet P-40 solubilized TAP2, suggesting that correct TAP2 folding is enhanced in the presence of TAP1. Simultaneously, the amount of TAP2 recovered by incubation with ATP-agarose increased dramatically and by a factor largely exceeding the effect of TAP1 on TAP2 folding (Fig.6 A). The latter phenomenon indicated either indirect recovery of TAP2 (itself with low ATP affinity) via ATP-bound TAP1, or an increase in the ATP binding affinity of TAP1-associated TAP2. Because isolated TAP1 subunits can bind ATP and be stabilized by it, ATP binding affinities of TAP1 mutants were first studied in the absence of TAP2 (Fig. 6 B). Western blot analysis of Nonidet P-40-solubilized material confirmed low expression levels of Nonidet P-40-solubilized T1Del and T1G538Q mutants, whereas all other mutants, including T1Rep, were expressed at similar high levels.

Here we show that cathepsin B is not involved in activation of caspase-11 induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and subsequent maturation of interleukin (IL)-1β in macrophages. Nevertheless, we found that the cathepsin B inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-fluoromethylketone (z-FA.fmk) prevents LPS-induced production of IL-1α, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor at the transcriptional level. The latter was not because of cathepsin B inhibition, but was mediated by inhibition of the transactivation potential of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). z-FA.fmk did not prevent LPS-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which was shown to be involved in NF-κB transactivation in response to LPS. These results suggest that the previously described therapeutic effect of z-FA.fmk in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis might not only result from inhibition of cathepsin B but also implicates an important contribution from the inhibition of NF-κB-dependent gene expression.

Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). The expression of many of these genes is regulated by the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). In almost all cell types, NF-κB exists as a dimer of a p50 and p65 subunit that is retained in an inactive cytoplasmic complex by binding to a third inhibitory subunit (IκB). NF-κB can be activated by many stimuli including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), TNF, and IL-1, which induce phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of the IκB subunit. This allows NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus, where it can bind to specific recognition sequences in the promoter region of various genes and stimulate their transcription. In addition to transcriptional regulation, translational or post-translational regulation is also involved in the production of a number of inflammatory mediators. For example, the maturation and secretion of IL-1β is controlled by caspase-1 (2Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R.

Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The critical role of caspase-1 and caspase-11 in inflammation is well illustrated by the finding that caspase-1- or caspase-11-deficient mice are resistant to LPS-induced septic shock (3Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that caspase-11 could be activated by cathepsin B in vitro (4Schotte P. Van Criekinge W. Van de Craen M. Van Loo G. Desmedt M. Grooten J. Cornelissen M. De Ridder L.

Cathepsin B is implicated in a number of inflammatory diseases and pathological conditions, such as bronchitis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute pancreatitis, and cancer progression (5Mort J.S.

In the case of rheumatoid arthritis, it is well documented that cytokines induce the secretion of lysosomal proteases of the cathepsin family by the main cellular population of rheumatoid synovial membranes and fluids (7Codorean E.

Benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-fluoromethylketone (z-FA.fmk) is a peptide inhibitor that irreversibly alkylates the active cysteine residue in cathepsin B, thereby inhibiting its proteolytic activity. In vivo, z-FA.fmk has been shown to inhibit the severity of inflammation, as well as the extent of cartilage and bone damage in adjuvant-induced arthritis (11Ahmed N.K. Martin L.A. Watts L.M.

In the present study we demonstrate that z-FA.fmk is also a potent inhibitor of NF-κB-dependent gene expression in macrophages, which might contribute to its described anti-inflammatory activity.

E64 was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. LPS originated from Sigma, and anti-IL-1β antibody was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Polyclonal anti-caspase-11 antibodies were raised in rabbits against purified murine caspase-11. Antibodies against p50, p65, and IκB were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal phosphospecific and polyclonal p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). To determine cathepsin B activity in total cell extracts, cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7, 1‥ Nonidet P-40, 200 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.

Data are expressed as increase in fluorescence as a function of time (ΔF/min). Macrophages were seeded in 6-well plates at 5 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were treated for 1 h with cathepsin B inhibitors before LPS stimulation (1 μg/ml). Supernatant was harvested after 48 h and assayed for IL-1 in a CTLL cell proliferation assay (13Vandenabeele P. Declercq W. Libert C. Fiers W. J. Immunol.

Lysates were cleared by centrifugation; cell extracts (100 μg of total protein) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These were blocked with 5‥ dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1‥ Tween 20 and were probed with primary and secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoreactivity was revealed with the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mf4/4 cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 105 cells/6-well plate. They were transfected with the LipofectAMINE transfection method (Life Technologies, Inc.) using p(κB)3LUC, which contains the luciferase gene after three copies of the NF-κB recognition sequence, and a minimal promoter (14Heyninck K.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded at 1.2 × 105cells/24-well plate. 66 h after transfection, cells were treated for 1 h with 50 μm z-FA.fmk, E64, or solvent Me2SO, after which they were either noninduced or induced for 6 h with 1 μg/ml LPS. Inducible promoter activity was determined by measuring the luciferase activity present in cell extracts as described previously (14Heyninck K. De Valck D. Vanden Berghe W. Van Criekinge W. Contreras R. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Beyaert R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1471-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Mf4/4 cells (106cells/6-well plate) were pretreated with or without 50 μmz-FA.fmk for 1 h and stimulated with LPS (1 μg/ml for 1 h). Nuclear extract preparations and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed essentially as described previously (15Plaisance S. Vanden Berghe W. Boone E. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3733-3743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extraction buffers contained several protease inhibitors including 2 mm Pefabloc (Pentapharm, Basel, Switzerland), 0.15 IU/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. NF-κB DNA binding was analyzed by incubating 8 μg of nuclear proteins for 30 min with an NF-κB-specific 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (5′-agctATGTGGGATTTTCCCATGAGCagct-3′), containing the NF-κB recognition sequence of the immunoglobulin κ-chain promoter. Protein·DNA complexes were separated on a 4‥ native polyacrylamide gel. Total RNA was extracted from 2 × 106 Mf4/4 cells with RNAzol (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX) and then analyzed for specific cytokine mRNA expression with a RiboQuant custom mouse template set (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. In line with our previous findings that cathepsin B can activate caspase-11 in vitro (4Schotte P. Van Criekinge W. Van de Craen M. Van Loo G. Desmedt M. Grooten J. Cornelissen M. De Ridder L. Vandekerckhove J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we studied the effect of two cathepsin B inhibitors, viz. E64 and z-FA.fmk, on the LPS-induced activation of procaspase-11 and production of IL-1β by macrophages, which is known to require caspase-11 (3Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Mf4/4 cells were preincubated for 1 h with 50 μm E64 or z-FA.fmk and subsequently stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 48 h. As expected, pretreatment of Mf4/4 cells with z-FA.fmk or E64 completely inhibited cathepsin B activity over a period of 1 to 72 h as measured with the fluorogenic substrate z-ARR.afc (see Fig. 1 A and data not shown). However, although the LPS-induced production of IL-1β could be completely inhibited by z-FA.fmk, E64 treatment had no effect at all. Similarly, pretreatment of the cells with the cathepsin B-specific inhibitor CA-074Me had no effect (data not shown). Identical results were obtained when IL-1β was measured in the supernatant in an IL-1-dependent CTLL proliferation assay (Fig.1 B) or in cell extracts by Western blotting with IL-1β-specific antibody (Fig. 1 C, upper panel). The slightly lower IL-1 levels, detected with the bioassay in the supernatant of E64-treated cells, are because of a limited toxic effect of E64 on the CTLL cells used for the bioassay. In line with the above results, proteolytic activation of procaspase-11 with the generation of the p36 subunit still occurs in LPS-stimulated macrophages in the presence of z-FA.fmk or E64 (Fig. 1 C, lower panel). Similar observations were made in pU5.18 macrophages. Measurement of a dose response in this cell line demonstrated that z-FA.fmk inhibits LPS-induced IL-1β production at a dose of 25–50 μm (Fig. 2), which is over 100 times higher than that required to inhibit cathepsin B (data not shown). In conclusion, these results exclude the involvement of cathepsin B in the LPS-induced signaling pathway leading to IL-1β production by macrophages, which is in contrast to the previously described effect of cathepsin B in vitro (4Schotte P. Van Criekinge W. Van de Craen M. Van Loo G. Desmedt M. Grooten J. Cornelissen M. De Ridder L. Vandekerckhove J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Moreover, our observations also demonstrate that z-FA.fmk is able to inhibit LPS-induced IL-1 production by a novel mechanism.Figure 2Dose response of LPS-stimulated pU5.18 macrophages to z-FA. fmk. pU5.18 macrophages were incubated for 1 h with the indicated concentrations of z-FA.fmk prior to stimulation with 1 μg/ml LPS for 48 h. Supernatants were harvested and assayed in an IL-1-dependent bioassay. Results are representative of three independent experiments (S.D. <10‥).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has previously been demonstrated that the LPS-induced expression of several cytokines can be regulated at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational levels (16Watkins L.R. Hansen M.K. Nguyen K.T. Lee J.E. Maier S.F. Life Sci. 1999; 65: 449-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the case of IL-1β, we demonstrated by Western blotting that z-FA.fmk inhibits synthesis of the inactive IL-1β precursor (Fig. 1 C). To investigate whether z-FA.fmk inhibits IL-1β synthesis at the transcriptional level, mRNA was isolated from Mf4/4 cells that were stimulated with LPS for 3 h in the absence or presence of 50 μm z-FA.fmk and analyzed for the expression of several cytokine mRNAs in a RiboQuant assay. This revealed that z-FA.fmk inhibits the LPS-induced synthesis of IL-1β at the mRNA level (Fig. 3). Also, the expression of IL-1α and TNF was strongly inhibited by z-FA.fmk, whereas IL-6 synthesis, as well as transcription of the housekeeping genes L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, were not affected (Fig. 3). It has previously been demonstrated that the transcription of the TNF and IL-1β genes is, at least partly, dependent on the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (17Goto M. Katayama K.I. Shirakawa F. Tanaka I. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 16-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To investigate whether z-FA.fmk inhibits LPS-induced IL-1 and TNF production by preventing LPS-induced NF-κB activation, we analyzed its effect on NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression in Mf4/4 cells that were transiently transfected with p(κB)3LUC and stimulated with LPS. Pretreatment of Mf4/4 cells with 50 μm z-FA.fmk for 1 h significantly inhibited LPS-induced luciferase reporter gene expression (Fig.4). As a control, expression of a noninducible cytomegalovirus-regulated luciferase reporter was not blocked by z-FA.fmk (data not shown). These results suggest that inhibition of NF-κB activity by z-FA.fmk contributes to the inhibitory effect of z-FA.fmk on the expression of IL-1β and several other cytokines in LPS-stimulated macrophages. We subsequently analyzed the effect of z-FA.fmk on LPS-induced NF-κB activation by measuring the amount of nuclear NF-κB in EMSA. Mf4/4 cells stimulated with LPS translocate NF-κB into the nucleus, resulting in a defined band in EMSA (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). Pretreatment of Mf4/4 cells with z-FA.fmk induced a slower migrating band in EMSA (Fig. 4 B, lane 3), and the faster migrating band disappeared. This might result from a change in the composition of the NF-κB complex. However, pretreatment of the nuclear extracts with polyclonal antibodies against p50 and p65 led to a reduction in intensity of both bands, demonstrating that p50 and p65 are present in both inducible complexes (Fig. 4 B,lanes 4–9). An alternative explanation for the z-FA.fmk-induced mobility shift could be that z-FA.fmk inhibits the potential proteolytic processing of one of the components of the NF-κB complex during nuclear extract preparation, even in the presence of general protease inhibitors such as Pefabloc, aprotinin, and leupeptin. To check this possibility we analyzed nuclear extracts of LPS-treated MF4/4 cells for the presence of intact p50 and p65 by immunoblotting. As expected, LPS induced nuclear translocation of p65 and p50, even in the presence of z-FA.fmk. However, in the absence of z-FA.fmk, p65 was cleaved to products of 31 and 33 kDa (Fig. 5 A). Cleavage products of p50 could not be detected (Fig. 5 B), although p50 levels were slightly increased in LPS-stimulated cells pretreated with z-FA.fmk. In contrast, p65 cleavage was not detected when cells were directly lysed in Laemmli buffer (Fig. 5 C). Analysis of the same extracts for IκB showed LPS-induced IκB degradation, which could not be prevented by z-FA.fmk pretreatment (Fig. 5 D). In conclusion, these results further demonstrate that inhibition of NF-κB-mediated gene expression by z-FA.fmk is not because of inhibition of the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in response to LPS. Moreover, the specific degradation of p65 in nuclear extracts of LPS-treated cells and its inhibition by z-FA.fmk pretreatment demonstrates that the slower migrating NF-κB complex, visible in EMSA of LPS-treated cells pretreated with z-FA.fmk (Fig. 4 B), results from the z-FA.fmk-mediated inhibition of p65 proteolysis during nuclear extraction. These data also demonstrate the risk of misinterpretation of mobility shifts liable to occur in EMSA. We and others previously demonstrated that p38 MAP kinase plays an essential role in the transactivation of NF-κB in response to TNF, whereas it is not involved in the pathway leading to nuclear translocation of NF-κB (18Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 19Bergmann M. Hart L. Lindsay M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6607-6610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Because z-FA.fmk also seems to interfere specifically with the transactivation of NF-κB in response to LPS, we analyzed whether p38 MAP kinase is also involved in NF-κB-dependent gene expression in response to LPS and whether z-FA.fmk affects the activation of p38 MAP kinase. Pretreatment of LPS-stimulated Mf4/4 cells with the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 showed that p38 MAP kinase was also involved in the enhanced transcriptional activity of NF-κB in response to LPS (Fig.6 A). However, z-FA.fmk did not affect the LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase in Mf4/4 cells, excluding the fact that z-FA.fmk prevents NF-κB transactivation by inhibiting the LPS-induced activation of p38 MAP kinase. Cathepsin B is a cysteine protease implicated in a number of inflammatory diseases and pathological conditions, such as bronchitis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute pancreatitis, and cancer progression (5Mort J.S. Recklies A.D. Poole A.R. Arthritis Rheum. 1984; 27: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,6Mort J.S. Recklies A.D. Poole A.R. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1985; 180: 243-245PubMed Google Scholar). The main function of cathepsin B is the degradation of proteins that have entered the lysosomal system from outside the cell (via endocytosis or phagocytosis) or from other compartments within the cell (autophagy). In addition, activation of a number of proteins such as procollagenase, proplasminogen activator, and prorenin has been described (20Kobayashi H. Moniwa N. Sugimura M. Shinohara H. Ohi H. Terao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Eeckhout Y. Vaes G. Biochem. J. 1977; 166: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 22Shinagawa T. Do Y.S. Baxter J.D. Carilli C. Schilling J. Hsueh W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1927-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that purified cathepsin B is also able to proteolytically activate the proinflammatory caspase-11in vitro (4Schotte P. Van Criekinge W. Van de Craen M. Van Loo G. Desmedt M. Grooten J. Cornelissen M. De Ridder L. Vandekerckhove J. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The latter results prompted us to investigate the role of cathepsin B in the activation of caspase-11 and the subsequent production of IL-1 in LPS-stimulated macrophages. For these experiments we made use of z-FA.fmk and E64, which are frequently used inhibitors of cathepsin B (23Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 24Rasnick D. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, none of these inhibitors was able to prevent the LPS-induced processing of caspase-11 in macrophages. To our surprise, z-FA.fmk completely inhibited the LPS-induced production of IL-1β. Also, IL-1α and TNF synthesis was abolished by pretreatment with z-FA.fmk, whereas IL-6 and caspase-11 production was not affected. Because E64 and CA-074Me did not modulate the LPS-induced production of these cytokines, we conclude that this effect of z-FA.fmk is independent of cathepsin B. Moreover, we were unable to detect an effect of LPS on cathepsin B activity in the cells studied (data not shown). z-FA.fmk was found to interfere with the production of IL-1 and TNF by preventing the transcription activation potential of NF-κB. It is still unclear why the expression of IL-6 is only minimally affected by z-FA.fmk, because IL-6 expression has previously been shown to be NF-κB-dependent (25Libermann T.A. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests the involvement of gene-specific regulatory mechanisms of NF-κB-dependent gene expression, as previously demonstrated in the case of TNF (26Means T.K. Pavlovich R.P. Roca D. Vermeulen M.W. Fenton M.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). This also fits with our observation that z-FA.fmk does not prevent the IκB kinase pathway leading to degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκB and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB. In contrast, z-FA.fmk seems to specifically interfere with a signaling pathway or molecule that leads to the transactivation of NF-κB and that might indeed be gene promoter-specific. The p38 MAP kinase pathway has previously been shown to fulfill such an NF-κB transactivation function in response to TNF (18Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Here we could demonstrate a similar role for p38 MAP kinase in activating NF-κB-dependent gene expression in response to LPS. However, z-FA.fmk did not interfere with the LPS-induced activation of p38 MAP kinase. Although we cannot exclude an effect of z-FA.fmk on the activation of downstream substrates of p38 MAP kinase, the above observations make it rather unlikely that z-FA.fmk modulates NF-κB-dependent gene expression by interfering with the p38 MAP kinase pathway. The fluoromethyl ketone group of z-FA.fmk is known to be very reactive with activated nucleophiles (27Shaw E. Angliker H. Rauber P. Walker B. Wikstrom P. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1986; 45: 1397-1403PubMed Google Scholar), and the specificity of drugs like z-FA.fmk is only controlled by the structure of the peptidyl portion of the reagent. Therefore, side reactions with other proteins susceptible to alkylation are likely to occur. In this context, we have previously shown that fluoromethyl ketone peptide inhibitors of caspases can nonspecifically inhibit the activity of several cathepsins (28Schotte P. Declercq W. Van Huffel S. Vandenabeele P. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that inhibition of NF-κB-dependent gene expression by several reagents, including helenalin and arsenite, is because of the irreversible alkylation of a cysteine residue in the p65 NF-κB subunit or the IκB kinase α and β subunits, respectively (29Kapahi P. Takahashi T. Natoli G. Adams S.R. Chen Y. Tsien R.Y. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36062-36066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 30Lyss G. Knorre A.

Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In all cases, this resulted in decreased DNA binding of NF-κB. As z-FA.fmk did not affect the nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-κB, it is unlikely that z-FA.fmk acts in a similar way. Moreover, other fmk-based peptide inhibitors, such as benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-DL-Asp-(OMe)-fmk and benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-DL-Asp(OMe)-fmk, did not have an effect on NF-κB-dependent gene expression in response to LPS (data not shown). Our observations illustrate that results obtained with the so-called specific cathepsin B inhibitor z-FA.fmk should be interpreted with care and verified by other inhibitors before any conclusion on the role of cathepsin B can be drawn. For example, cathepsin B has been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis, and z-FA.fmk has been used successfully to treat that disease (11Ahmed N.K. Martin L.A. Watts L.M. Palmer J. Thornburg L. Prior J. Esser R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1201-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the role of NF-κB and IL-1 in rheumatoid arthritis is also well documented (32Gabay C. Arend W.P. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1998; 20: 229-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very likely that the therapeutic effect of z-FA.fmk in this disease is at least partially mediated by its inhibitory effect on NF-κB-dependent gene expression. These results, as well as the fact that z-FA.fmk can be used in vivo without severe side effects (11Ahmed N.K. Martin L.A. Watts L.M. Palmer J. Thornburg L. Prior J. Esser R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 1201-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Esser R.E. Watts L.M. Angelo R.A. Thornburg L.P. Prior J.J. Palmer J.T. J.

Rheumatol. 1988; 15: 1525-1535PubMed Google Scholar), suggest z-FA.fmk to be a promising new tool for the treatment of a number of other inflammatory diseases. Our studies also revealed that the band pattern obtained in EMSA for NF-κB can be influenced by the in vitro cleavage of the p65 NF-κB subunit by a z-FA.fmk-sensitive protease present in nuclear extracts. Cleavage of p65 by this protease results in a p50·p65 complex, which induces a decreased shift in EMSA. These findings might have important implications for the interpretation of results based on EMSA with NF-κB-specific oligonucleotides. In many cases, the appearance of two bands is explained to correspond to a p50·p50 and a p50·p65 complex, respectively (15Plaisance S. Vanden Berghe W. Boone E. Fiers W. Haegeman G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3733-3743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nasuhara Y. Adcock I.M. Catley M. Barnes P.J. Newton R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19965-19972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, we showed that the lower band can also correspond to a complex of p50 and truncated p65. It should be mentioned that these effects could still be observed when extracts were prepared in the presence of a mixture of general protease inhibitors such as aprotinin, leupeptin, E64, and Pefabloc. Although we described this effect in macrophages, we also noticed p65 cleavage in other cells, such as the L929 fibrosarcoma cell line (data not shown). A similar truncation of p65 has recently been reported when extracts were prepared from acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (37Kordes U. Krappmann D. Heissmeyer V. Ludwig W.D. Scheidereit C. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In the latter case, p65 cleavage could be prevented by α1-antitrypsin. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that z-FA.fmk can behave as a powerful inhibitor of NF-κB-dependent gene expression in response to LPS, implicating that it is an interesting tool for the development of novel anti-inflammatory treatments. Moreover, we also propose the use of this inhibitor when preparing nuclear extracts for EMSA with NF-κB-specific probes."
https://openalex.org/W2130889998,"In contrast to the fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), little is known about intracellular signaling of FGFR2. The signaling cascade of FGFR2 was studied using the perforated patch configuration of the patch-clamp technique in cultured rat retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells that express both FGFR1 and FGFR2. Interaction of signaling proteins was studied using immunoprecipitation techniques with membrane proteins from RPE cells and freshly isolated rat brain. When Ba(2+) currents through L-type channels were studied, extracellular application of bFGF (10 ng/ml) led to a shift of the steady-state activation to more negative values. In 50% of cells, an additional increase in maximal current amplitude was observed. This effect was blocked by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin A (10(-5) M) but was not influenced by the FGFR1 blocker SU5402 (2 x 10(-5) M) or by the blocker for src-kinase herbimycin A (10(-5) M). Immunoprecipitation of FGFR2 led to coprecipitation of alpha 1D Ca(2+) channel subunits and precipitation of alpha 1D subunits led to coprecipitation of FGFR2. Immunoprecipitation of FGFR1 did not result in the coprecipitation with alpha 1D Ca(2+) channel subunits. The coprecipitation results were comparable when using brain tissue and RPE cells. The alpha 1D subunit-specific band were stained with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies. We conclude that FGFR2 acts via a different signaling cascade than FGFR1. This cascade involves an src-kinase-independent, close functional interaction of FGFR2 and the alpha subunit of neuroendocrine L-type channels."
https://openalex.org/W2075658710,"Abstract The elucidation of the cDNA sequence for sturgeon proorphanin provides a unique window for interpreting the evolutionary history of the opioid/orphanin gene family. The molecular “fossil” status of this precursor can be seen in several ancestral sequence characteristics that point to its origin as a duplication of either a prodynorphin- or proenkephalin-like gene. The sturgeon proorphanin cDNA encodes a precursor protein of 194 residues, and the orphanin heptadecapeptide itself binds not only the opioid receptor-like 1 (ORL1) receptor but also the classical (μ, κ, and δ) opioid receptors with near equal affinity. Allowing for this broad receptor specificity are several amino acid substitutions at key positions in the heptadecapeptide sequence, relative to its mammalian orthologs, that have been linked by amino acid scans and site-directed mutagenic studies to the exclusion of mammalian orphanin FQ/nociceptin from classic opioid ligands (i.e. F1Y and L14W). The unique receptor binding profile of sturgeon orphanin not only provides insight into the evolutionary history of the opioid and opioid-related peptides but also provides an ideal context in which to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which novel and often divergent physiological functions arise in receptor-ligand systems."
https://openalex.org/W2143699288,"We report a novel 3-dimensional model for visualizing tumor cell migration across a nylon mesh-supported gelatin matrix. To visualize migration across these model barriers, cell proteolytic activity of the pericellular matrix was detected using Bodipy-BSA (fluorescent upon proteolysis) and DQ collagen (fluorescent upon collagenase activity). For 3-dimensional image reconstruction, multiple optical images at sequential z axis positions were deconvoluted by computer analysis. Specificity was indicated using well-known inhibitors. Using these fluorescent proteolysis markers and imaging methods, we have directly demonstrated proteolytic and collagenolytic activity during tumor cell invasion. Moreover, it is possible to visualize migratory pathways followed by tumor cells during matrix invasion. Using cells of differing invasive potentials (uPAR-negative T-47D wild-type and uPAR-positive T-47D A2--1 cells), we show that the presence of the T-47D-A2--1 cells facilitates the entry of T-47D wild-type cells into the matrix. In some cases, wild-type cells follow T-47D A2--1 cells into the matrix whereas other T-47D-wild-type cells appear to enter without the direct intervention of T-47D A2--1 cells. Thus, we have developed a new 3-dimensional model of tumor cell invasion, demonstrated protein and collagen disruption, mapped the pathways followed by tumor cells during migration through an extracellular matrix, and illustrated cross-talk among tumor cell populations during invasion."
https://openalex.org/W1990523704,"The intramolecular contacts in heterotrimeric G proteins that determine the rates of basal and receptor-stimulated nucleotide exchange are not fully understood. The α subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins consists of two domains: a Ras-like domain with structural homology to the monomeric G protein Ras and a helical domain comprised of six α-helices. The bound nucleotide lies in a deep cleft between the two domains. Exchange of the bound nucleotide may involve opening of this cleft. Thus interactions between the domains may affect the rate of nucleotide exchange in G proteins. We have tested this hypothesis in the α subunit of the rod cell G protein transducin (Gαt).

The rates of basal and rhodopsin-catalyzed nucleotide exchange were determined using a trypsin digestion assay specifically adapted for kinetic measurements.

Experiments with Gαi1 suggest by comparison that the organization and function of the interdomain region differ among various G protein subtypes. transducin α subunit of transducin βγ subunits of transducin n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein signaling active state of rhodopsin p21ras guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Transducin (Gt)1 is the heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide binding regulatory protein (G protein) of the rod cell. In the GDP-bound state, the α subunit of transducin (Gαt) does not signal. Following exchange of GDP for GTP, which is catalyzed by photoactivated rhodopsin (R*), Gαt signals to its downstream effector. Physiologically, the detection of dim light requires that the basal nucleotide exchange rates of Gt be very low to prevent background noise and that R*-catalyzed exchange be very efficient, to ensure consistent detection and amplification of light signals. Gαt consists of two domains: a Ras-like domain, which is structurally similar to the monomeric G protein p21ras (Ras), and a helical domain, which is unique to the heterotrimeric G proteins (1Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The bound nucleotide lies in a deep cleft between the two domains (Fig. 1 A). Although the discovery of this arrangement initially prompted speculation that nucleotide exchange would involve opening of the interdomain cleft (1Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), and that interactions between the domains might affect the rate of nucleotide exchange, the intramolecular contacts in Gαt that determine the rates of nucleotide exchange remain to be elucidated. There is evidence that structures that do not directly interact with the nucleotide can modulate both the basal and the receptor-catalyzed rates of nucleotide exchange. For example, although the direct contacts between the protein and the nucleotide are virtually the same in closely related subtypes of G protein, the rates of basal nucleotide exchange vary widely. Furthermore, R* tremendously accelerates nucleotide exchange, yet available evidence indicates that it does not directly contact the nucleotide binding site (2Iiri T. Farfel Z. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1998; 394: 35-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). One of the regions of the G protein hypothesized to control nucleotide release rates without directly contacting the nucleotide is the interdomain interface. The interface is composed of contacts adjacent to the nucleotide and also interactions that are distant from the nucleotide (Fig. 1). These latter interactions involve residues located on the αD-αE loop (amino acid residues 139–147 of Gαt) of the helical domain, the Switch III region (residues 227–238), and the αG region (residues 269–277) of the Ras-like domain (Fig. 1 B). These interactions have been implicated in mediating the lower rate of dissociation of GTPγS relative to GDP in Gαi1 (3Mixon M.B. Lee E. Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1995; 20: 954-960Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and in affecting the basal nucleotide exchange rates in Gαi1 (4Remmers A.E. Engel C. Liu M. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13795-13800Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Gαs (5Warner D.R. Weng G., Yu, S. Matalon R. Weinstein L.S. J. Biol.

A. 1999; 96: 4268-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Additionally, studies in Gαshave suggested that interdomain interactions are involved in mediating rapid nucleotide exchange catalyzed by the β2-adrenergic receptor (7Marsh S.R. Grishina G. Wilson P.T. Berlot C.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 981-990PubMed Google Scholar, 8Grishina G. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15053-15060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have studied the function of several residues of Gαtthat are located at the interdomain interface but do not contact the nucleotide. A number of site-directed mutations of these residues were constructed. The well documented difficulties in expressing and purifying recombinant Gαt were overcome by expressing the mutant proteins in vitro in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The rates of basal and R*-catalyzed nucleotide exchange were measured using a trypsin digestion assay specifically adapted for kinetic measurements. Alteration of two conserved lysine residues, Lys273 and Lys276, increased the rate of spontaneous nucleotide exchange 5–10-fold. However, in contrast to what would be predicted based on published structural and biochemical studies, we found no evidence that interactions that span the domain interface were important in either maintaining the low rate of basal nucleotide exchange or in supporting the high rate of R*-catalyzed exchange in Gαt. Experiments with Gαi1demonstrated that conserved lysine residues serve different roles in Gαi1 than in Gαt. In general, the function of the interdomain region appears to differ among various G protein subtypes. Buffers, nucleotides, protease inhibitors, and salts were from Sigma or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [35S]Methionine was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. TPCK-treated trypsin was from Worthington Biochemicals. Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Genelink, Inc. DNA sequencing was carried out using BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing in the DNA sequencing core facility at the Rockefeller University. The parent for all Gαtconstructs was pGEM2sTα, the synthetic bovine Gαt gene (9Sakmar T.P. Khorana H.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6361-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) cloned into the pGEM2 plasmid under control of a SP6 promoter. Site-directed point mutations were prepared using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). For each mutant, two complementary primers were designed that coded for the desired mutation as well as 10–15 bases of complementary sequence on either side of the mutation site. Most amino acid substitutions could be accomplished with two or less nucleotide changes. The total length of each primer was 20–30 bases. The mutagenesis reaction (50 μl final) consisted of 5 ng of template plasmid, 1 μl of cloned Pfu polymerase (2.5 units/μl) (Stratagene), 5 μl of 10× Pfu buffer (Stratagene), 250 nm concentration of each primer, 800 μm concentration dNTP mix. The reactions were thermocycled in a GeneAmp 9600 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) thermocycler with the following program: 3 min at 95 °C, 14 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 8 min at 68 °C, and then 10 min at 72 °C. Amplification of the mutated plasmid was verified by running 1 μl of the reaction on a 1% agarose gel. The parental plasmid was selectively digested using the restriction enzymeDpnI (New England Biolabs) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. SinceDpnI digests only methylated DNA, the wild-type template plasmid was restricted. The DpnI-treated mutant plasmid was transformed into chemically competent bacteria (subcloning efficiency DH-5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) or OneShot TOP10 (Invitrogen)). Generally the ratio of recombinant transformants following transformations with QuikChange reactions done with primers compared with control reactions run without primers was >50:1. All constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing of the entire coding region of Gαt. The parent for all Gαi1 constructs was pGEM2Gαi1, the Gαi1 gene cloned into the pGEM2 plasmid under control of a SP6 promoter. To improve expression, a 217-base pair segment of the 5′-untranslated region was removed by QuikChange mutagenesis. Recombinant Gαt subunits were prepared using the TNT Quick Coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation kit (Promega). For each translation, 20 μl of lysate mix was combined with 4 μl of DNA (0.5 μg total) and 1 μl of ∼9 μm [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a specific activity of approximately ∼1250 Ci/mmol. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. Subsequent manipulations were performed on ice or at 4 °C. The translated products were passed over BioSpin 6 gel filtration spin columns (Bio-Rad) twice consecutively to remove excess nucleotides and [35S]methionine. The volume of each reaction was then adjusted to 100 μl in Buffer A (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% (w/v)n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (DM)). If the reaction was to be studied in a R*-catalyzed assay, Gβγt was added to a final concentration of 30 nm. Every experiment was performed using freshly translated material. The digestion procedure was adapted from Garcia et al. (10Garcia P.D. Onrust R. Bell S.M. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4460-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Aliquots (8 μl) of the reaction mix were withdrawn and mixed with 1.5 μl of digest buffer (5% Lubrol, 2 mm GDP, 1 mg/ml TPCK trypsin) or digest control buffer (5% Lubrol, 2 mm GDP). The digests were incubated on ice for 30 min (Gαt samples) or for 5 min (Gαi1 samples). Digestion was terminated by the addition of 2.5 μl of termination solution (10 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), followed by 6 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer (New England Biolabs). Samples were frequently stored at −20° for up to 48 h. Subsequently, the samples were boiled for 3 min, and the protein fragments were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 15% pre-cast Tris-HCl minigels (Bio-Rad). Following electrophoresis, the gels were fixed for >30 min in 50% MeOH/10% acetic acid and then soaked for 5 min in 7% methanol/7% acetic acid/2% glycerol. The gels were vacuum-dried onto filter paper (Whatman), and the radiolabeled Gαt bands were visualized by exposing the gels to a storage phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics) for 1–7 days. The phosphor storage screens were scanned using a Storm Imager machine (Molecular Dynamics) at 200-micron resolution. The resulting images of the gels were analyzed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Lines were drawn down the center of each lane on the gel image, perpendicular to the bands. The intensity of each pixel along the line was determined as the average of 5–10 pixels on either side of the line. In this way, most of the width of each lane was considered. Any defect in the gel was avoided by careful placement of the lines. The intensity of each pixel was plotted as a function of position along the line so that the bands on the gel were represented as peaks on the graph. The base line of the graph was set so as to exclude nonspecific background intensity. GDP-bound Gαt yielded a ∼23-kDa band, whereas GTPγS-bound or GDP/AlF 4− -bound Gαt yielded a ∼34-kDa band. The areas of the peaks corresponding to the ∼23- and ∼34-kDa bands were then calculated and recorded in an Excel spreadsheet. The fraction of functional Gαt in the GTPγS-bound state in a given lane was determined by the following formula: (area of ∼34-kDa peak)/((1.4 × area of ∼23-kDa peak) + (area of ∼34-kDa peak)). The area of the ∼23-kDa peak was multiplied by 1.4 to normalize for the smaller number of methionines in the smaller fragment relative to those in the ∼34-kDa fragment. This coefficient was adjusted (to 1.3) for analysis of samples in which Met228 was replaced. Activation kinetics were analyzed by plotting the fraction of Gαt activated as a function of time. In the basal exchange rate assays, the data were fit to a single exponential rise to a maximum equation of the form: percent activated = c + 100(1 − exp(−kt)). The apparent rate constants derived from the fits are presented in Table I.Table IRate constants for basal nucleotide exchange measured for Gαtand Gαt mutantsArranged by amino acid positionArranged by basal exchange rateMutantkapp1-aThe apparent rate constants were derived from fits of each data set to the exponential rise equation, y = c + 100(1 − exp(−kt)).

Open table in a new tab For experiments conducted with Gαi1, the intensity of the GDP-dependent band could not be determined reliably due to nonspecific background intensities in the region of the gel where the GDP band migrated. This background was present even in undigested samples of Gαi1. Since the ratio of the GTPγS-dependent band to the sum of the GTPγS and GDP bands could not be determined, the intensity of the GTPγS band was expressed as a fraction of the total intensity in each lane. Activation time courses were plotted as the change in this intensity over time. For fully activated Gαi1, the GTPγS band accounted for roughly 25–30% of the intensity in the lane. Control reactions were performed on each sample to check the quantity and apparent molecular mass of the expressed protein, as well as the digest patterns following incubation with GDP and GDP/AlF 4− . From each 100-μl sample of translated Gαt, 30 μl was removed and combined with 100 μm GDP. Of this 30 μl, one 8-μl aliquot was digested (“+GDP”); another 8-μl aliquot was mock-digested with digest control buffer (“undigested”). The remaining 14 μl was combined with a final concentration of 0.17 mm AlCl3 and 10 mm NaF added from separate 30× stock solutions. Following a 10-min incubation at room temperature, an 8-μl aliquot was removed and digested (“+GDP/AlF 4−”). Samples (70 μl each) of translated Gαt or mutant Gαt in Buffer A were quickly warmed to room temperature in a water bath, and GTPγS was added to a final concentration of 100 μm. Aliquots (8 μl) were withdrawn at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 h following GTPγS addition and digested. The activity of the protein following 6-h incubation at room temperature was investigated by addition of R* and Gβγt(30 nm each, see below) and incubation under room light for 20 min. A final 8-μl aliquot was then removed and digested. For Gαi1 samples, which activated very quickly, aliquots were taken for a 180-min time course, and the R*/Gβγt mix was not added. Samples (70 μl each) of translated Gαt or mutant Gαt in Buffer A were quickly warmed to room temperature in a water bath. A mixture of R* and GTPγS (4 μl) was added to the sample yielding a final concentration of 30 nm R* and 14 μm GTPγS. Immediately before addition to the reaction, the rhodopsin was photolyzed by illumination for 15 s with a fiber optic cable connected to a Dolan Jenner lamp equipped with a >495-nm long-pass filter. The samples were incubated at room temperature under illumination. Aliquots (8 μl) were withdrawn and digested at 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, and 20 min following addition of the R*/GTPγS mix. Gt was prepared from frozen bovine retinas (Lawson, Inc., Lincoln, NE) using standard techniques (11Kuhn H. Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 12Fung B.K.

The proteins were eluted from the column by applying a 0–2 m NaCl gradient. Gβγtconcentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent according to manufacturer's instructions. Concentrations of Gt and Gαt samples were determined by spectrofluorometric titration as described previously (14Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The proteins were stored at −20 °C in a 50% glycerol buffer until use. Purified recombinant Gαi1 expressed in Sf9 cells was provided by Dr. S. Graber (West Virginia University) (15Kazmi M.A. Snyder L.A. Cypess A.M. Graber S.G. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3734-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Urea-washed disc membranes, the gift of Dr. K. C. Min, were prepared as described elsewhere (16Min K.C. Gravina S.A. Sakmar T.P. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The membranes were solubilized in 1% DM, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The resulting solubilized rhodopsin displayed aA280/A500 spectral ratio of <1.8 and a concentration of ∼8 μm. The assay was performed essentially as described previously (14Fahmy K. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7229-7236Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) using a Spex Fluorolog spectrofluorometer equipped with a 150-watt xenon arc lamp. A solution of 250 nm concentration of Gαt or Gαi1 was prepared in fluorescence buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% (w/v) DM). Solution (0.5 ml) was placed in a quartz microcuvette and loaded into the thermojacketed cuvette holder equipped with a magnetic stirrer at 25 °C. Protein fluorescence was excited at 300 nm with 2-nm slit width, and emission intensity was collected at 345 nm with a 12-nm slit width. The activation reaction was initiated by injecting 15 μl of GTPγS solution to a final concentration of 5 μm. Nucleotide exchange was observed as an increase in the intensity of tryptophan fluorescence emission that results from conformational changes in Trp207 that occur upon binding GTP (17Faurobert E. Otto-Bruc A. Chardin P. Chabre M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4191-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A series of site-directed mutants of Gαt with replacements of residues located at the interdomain interface was prepared. Sites were selected for mutation based on their position in the crystal structure of GDP-bound Gαt (18Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), as well as their importance in Gαi1 and Gαssuggested by published studies (see below). Selected residues were replaced with alanine, or with the amino acid present in the homologous position of either Gαi1 or Gαs, and/or with amino acids reported to cause altered phenotypes in Gαi1 or Gαs. For each mutant Gαt, the rates of both basal (i.e.uncatalyzed) and R*-catalyzed nucleotide exchange were measured. All Gαtconstructs were expressed in vitro in a coupled transcription/translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Time course experiments confirmed that in vitro expression was maximal in 90 min (not shown). Typical reactions with plasmids encoding Gαt or Gαt mutant genes yielded one major protein band at the expected molecular mass of ∼40-kDa (Fig. 2). Generally 80–90% of the total intensity in the lane was in the one band. Expressed Gαtwas digested with trypsin following various treatments. Inactive, GDP-bound Gαt was prepared by incubating in vitro translated Gαt with 100 μm GDP. Trypsin proteolysis of this sample resulted in the formation of a ∼23-kDa fragment (Fig. 2). The active conformation was prepared by incubating Gαt with GDP and AlF 4− . AlF 4− is known to bind to Gαt-GDP and simulate the presence of the γ-phosphate of GTP. Therefore, a conformation nearly identical to the activated GTP-bound conformation is induced (19Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Digestion of the AlF 4− -activated Gαt yielded a ∼34-kDa band and no ∼23-kDa band. Similarly, activation of Gαt with GTPγS yielded an identical ∼34-kDa band following trypsin digestion (Fig. 2). In all cases, trypsin proteolysis produced a variety of lower molecular weight fragments. Some of these were the smaller polypeptides that were cleaved to produced the ∼23- and ∼34-kDa fragments. Others likely resulted from extensive proteolysis of protein that was not properly folded. This is consistent with the large number of potential trypsin sites present in the primary structure of Gαt and the relatively small number of accessible sites in the properly folded tertiary structure. The fraction of the total pool of translated Gαt that was properly folded and functional was estimated from the ratio of the intensities of the ∼34-kDa band following GDP/AlF 4− treatment (i.e. the properly folded, activable pool) to that of the ∼40-kDa band in the undigested sample (i.e. the total pool of translated full-length protein). This ratio was generally about 0.15 for wild-type Gαt and severalfold higher for Gαi1. This result parallels the functional expression levels of Gαtand Gαi1 that have been observed in other heterologous expression systems. Thus, in vitro expression might serve as a rapid and useful predictor of the expression level of a given G protein construct in other systems. The rate of trypsin proteolysis of GDP- and GDP/AlF 4− -treated Gαt and the stabilities of the resulting fragments were investigated by digestion time course experiments. Both the ∼23- and ∼34-kDa bands formed completely by 20 min and remained stable until at least 40 min in the presence of trypsin (data not shown). We therefore chose to stop the digestion after 30 min in all experiments. Similar experiments with Gαi1 indicated that digestion occurred more quickly. Accordingly, digests were run for 5 min with Gαi1samples. Three major sites of trypsin proteolysis in properly folded Gαt have been identified: Lys18, Arg204, and Arg310 (20Mazzoni M.R. Malinski J.A. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14072-14081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we investigated which of these sites were contributing to the fragments produced under the digestion conditions used in this study. The mutants K18A, R204H, and R310A were prepared, expressedin vitro, and digested following treatment with either GDP or GDP/AlF 4− . Formation of the ∼23-kDa band following treatment with GDP was altered only by the R204H mutation (not shown). Arg204 is the site at which cleavage occurred in the GDP form to yield the ∼23-kDa fragment, but which was protected from digestion in the GTPγS-bound conformation. Arg204 is located in the Switch II region of Gαt, and crystal structures confirm that it moves from a surface exposed to a buried position upon activation (1Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 18Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Formation of the ∼34-kDa band following activation with GDP/AlF 4− was affected only by the R310A mutation (not shown). Thus Arg310 appears to be the site at which trypsin proteolysis occurred to yield the ∼34-kDa fragment. The K18A mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type; digestion at Lys18does not appear to contribute to the formation of either fragment under the conditions used (not shown). Using these results, the ratio of the number of methionines in the ∼34-kDa band relative to the ∼23-kDa band was determined to be 1.4. This factor was used to normalize the intensity of the ∼23-kDa band in calculating the fraction of activated Gαt in each aliquot. The fraction of Gαt in the active conformation in a partially activated sample was calculated as the intensity of the ∼34-kDa band (i.e. the activated Gαt) divided by the sum of the intensities of the ∼23- and ∼34-kDa bands. The sum of the intensities of the ∼23- and ∼34-kDa bands"

Murine myeloid FDC-P1 cells transfected with the CSF-1 receptor (FD/WT) adopt a macrophage-like morphology when cultured in CSF-1. This process is abrogated in FDC-P1 cells transfected with the CSF-1 receptor with a tyrosine to phenyalanine substitution at position 807 (FD/807), suggesting that a molecular interaction critical to differentiation signaling is lost (Bourette, R. P., Myles, G. M., Carlberg, K., Chen, A. R., and Rohrschneider, L. R. (1995) Cell Growth Differ. 6, 631–645). A detailed examination of lysates of CSF-1-treated FD/807 cells by two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) revealed a number of proteins whose degree of tyrosine phosphorylation was modulated by the Y807F mutation. Included in this category were three phosphorylated proteins that co-migrated with p46/52Shc. Immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, andin vitro binding studies suggest that they are indeed p46/52Shc. A key regulator of differentiation in a number of cell systems, ERK was observed to exhibit an activity that correlated with the relative degree of differentiation induced by CSF-1 in the two cell types. Transfection of cells with a non-tyrosine-phosphorylatable form of p46/52Shc prevented the normally observed CSF-1-mediated macrophage differentiation as determined by adoption of macrophage-like morphology and expression of the monocyte/macrophage lineage cell surface marker, Mac-1. These results are the first to suggest that p46/52Shc may play a role in CSF-1-induced macrophage differentiation.

CSF-1 binds to the class IV cytokine receptor family member, the CSF-1R, which is the product of the c-fms proto-oncogene (2Sherr C.J. Blood. 1990; 75: 1Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding the CSF-1R undergoes dimerization and subsequent auto- and trans-phosphorylation (3Roussel M.F. Downing J.R. Sherr C.J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 25PubMed Google Scholar, 4Tapley P.

Biol. 1990; 10: 2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the CSF-1R is thought to create docking sites for downstream signal transduction molecules containing SH2 domains (6Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 7Anderson D. Koch C.A. Grey L. Ellis C. Moran M.F. Pawson T.

Such interactions are thought to mediate both the formation and also the binding, directly or indirectly, to the phosphorylated CSF-1R of signaling molecule complexes containing Grb2, Sos, p150, PI 3-kinase and Shc (9Lioubin M.N.

The signaling events that mediate either proliferation or differentiation in cells of the macrophage lineage are poorly understood. Previously, the function of the CSF-1R in growth and differentiation has been examined by transfecting the CSF-1R into the murine hemopoietic FDC-P1 cells (FD) (16Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar). These cells became responsive to CSF-1 and underwent changes in morphology suggestive of macrophage differentiation (17Rohrschneider L.R. Metcalf D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Single and multiple substitutions of tyrosines for phenylalanines in the CSF-1R at positions 697 (FD/697), 706 (FD/706), and 721 (FD/721) were not observed to affect proliferation or differentiation (16Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar). This lack of an effect on proliferation or differentiation occurred despite the inhibitory effects of the Y697F mutation on Grb-2 binding to the CSF-1R (18van der Geer P. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the Y721F mutation on PI 3-kinase activation (9Lioubin M.N. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Bowtell D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Reedijk M. Liu X. van der Geer P. Letwin K. Waterfield M.D. Hunter T. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and the Y706F mutation on Stat-1 activation (14Novak U. Nice E. Hamilton J.A. Paradiso L. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2607PubMed Google Scholar). The Y807F substitution was observed to impair phospholipase Cγ-2 activation, which appears to act with PI 3-kinase during CSF-1-induced FD/WT differentiation to macrophages (20Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Choi J.L. Rohrschneider L.R. EMBO J. 1997; 19: 5880Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the exact signaling mechanism(s) that are abrogated by the Y807F mutation and critical to differentiation are poorly understood (16Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to FD/807 cells where there is a defect in differentiation, fibroblasts transfected with the human CSF-1RY809F, the human equivalent of the Y807F mutation, were found to be incapable of proliferation (3Roussel M.F. Downing J.R. Sherr C.J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 25PubMed Google Scholar). No differentiation phenotype exists for the CSF-1R-transfected fibroblasts, and the Y809F substitution did not modulate the accumulation of mRNA of two transcription factors, c-Fos and JunB (21Roussel M.F. Shurtleff S.A. Downing J.R. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In other cell systems, modulation of c-fos mRNA levels has been associated with macrophage lineage differentiation (22Kim Y.R. Abraham N.G. Lutton J.D. Leuk. Res. 1993; 15: 409Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Yamamoto-Yamaguchi Y. Makishima M. Kanatani Y. Kasukabe T. Honma Y. Exp. Hematol. 1996; 24: 682PubMed Google Scholar) as well as with osteoclast differentiation (24Roux S. Pichaud F. Quinn J. Lalande A. Morieux C. Jullienne A. de Vernejoul M.C. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Taken together, these reports suggest that the murine Tyr807 (or human Tyr809) may be involved in signaling pathway(s) that, depending on the cell system, are involved in either differentiation and/or proliferation. The p46/52Shc adaptor protein is widely expressed and is composed of a C-terminal SH2 domain and an N-terminal protein tyrosine binding domain (25Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Treatment of human monocytes with CSF-1 results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p46/52Shc and its association with Grb2 (12Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Yuan Z. Emoto Y. Prasad K.V. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6132Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A complex of Grb2 and p46/52Shcwas found to co-immunoprecipitate CSF-1R following treatment of FD/WT cells with CSF-1 (9Lioubin M.N. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Bowtell D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In other cell systems, p46/52Shc also forms complexes with p125FAK and PI 3-kinase (11Saleem A. Kharbanda S. Yuan Z.M. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 12Kharbanda S. Saleem A. Yuan Z. Emoto Y. Prasad K.V. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6132Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Given the recurring observation of Grb-2 and p46/52Shcassociation in a range of cell types, it is interesting that the CSF-1R-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p46/52Shc is unaffected by the Y697F substitution at the Grb2 binding site (9Lioubin M.N. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Bowtell D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This implies that there may be a CSF-1R site(s) involved in p46/52Shc phosphorylation that has yet to be identified. While the Tyr to Phe substitution at position 807 of the CSF-1R in FD cells leads to a loss of the ability to differentiate into macrophage-like cells in response to CSF-1, the molecular basis for this is yet to be determined. Examination of the tyrosine phosphorylation profile of Nonidet P-40 lysate proteins in CSF-1-treated FD/WT and FD/807 cells by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE has failed to reveal any differences (16Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar). We used the higher resolving power of two-dimensional SDS-PAGE to examine the phosphotyrosine patterns of CSF-1-treated FD/WT and FD/807 cells to identify tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that may be involved in macrophage differentiation. DMEM, streptomycin, and penicillin were purchased from ICN-Flow Laboratories, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia), and fetal bovine serum and heat-inactivated new born calf serum from Commonwealth Serum Laboratories (Parkville, Victoria, Australia). Other reagents were obtained as follows: recombinant human CSF-1 from Chiron Corp., recombinant murine IL-3 from Biotechnology Australia Pty. Ltd. (Roseville, Sydney, Australia). The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal 4G10-conjugated to HRPO (4G10-HRPO), and p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, biotin-conjugated 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), phospho-ERK rabbit polyclonal (New England Biolabs Inc.) anti-Erk-2 goat polyclonal and mouse monoclonal anti-p52Shc antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The following secondary antibodies were used: HRPO-conjugated, affinity-purified, swine immunoglobulins to rabbit immunoglobulins (Dako), HRPO-conjugated rabbit immunoglobulins to mouse immunoglobulins (Dako), and HRPO-conjugated streptavidin (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The murine hemopoietic FD/WT and FD/807 cell lines were obtained from Drs. K Carlberg and L. Rohrschneider (Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle) and have been described previously (16Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar). M1 murine myeloid cells were transfected with wild type c-fms (M1/WT) or c-fms with the tyrosine mutated to phenylalanine (M1/807). Briefly, wild type c-fms(obtained from D. Hume, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia) and a Y807F c-fms mutant were cloned into the pEF-BOS expression vector (26Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Mutation of tyrosine 807 to phenylalanine was generated by PCR using mutagenic primers that substituted the codon of Y807F from TTC to TAC. All PCR fragments were generated using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and mutant clones were fully sequenced prior to experimental use. The PCR fragments containing the mutations were then cloned into the wild type c-fms gene. The expression vectors were introduced into M1 cells as described previously (27Marks D.C. Csar X.F. Wilson N.J. Novak U. Ward A.C. Kanagasundarum V. Hoffmann B.W. Hamilton J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The capacity of M1/WT cells to adopt a macrophage morphology in response to treatment with CSF-1 was examined as before (27Marks D.C. Csar X.F. Wilson N.J. Novak U. Ward A.C. Kanagasundarum V. Hoffmann B.W. Hamilton J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and confirmed to be similar to that of FD/WT cells (16Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the inability of M1/807 cells to adopt a macrophage morphology in response to treatment with CSF-1 was examined and found to be similar to that of FD/807 cells (16Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar). Murine DNA constructs encoding Myc-tagged forms of either wild type p52Shc or a non-tyrosine-phosphorylatable form of p52Shc with Tyr to Phe substitutions at positions 239, 240, and 317 were a kind gift from Dr. Benjamin Margolis (28Blaikie P.A. Fournier E. Dilworth S.M. Birnbaum D. Borg J.-P. Margolis B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). They were transfected using the FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 3 µl of FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent was diluted in 100 µl of serum-free DMEM for 10 min. To this, 1 µg of cDNA was added to achieve a final concentration of 0.1 µg/ml. After incubation at room temperature for 15 min, this mixture was added dropwise to 2 ml of M1/WT cells at 1 × 105/ml. Cells were then cultured for 14 days in DMEM with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated new born calf serum containing puromycin (2 µg/ml). Selected cells expressing either the wild type p52Shc (M1/WTWTShc) or a non-tyrosine-phosphorylatable form of p52Shc with Tyr to Phe substitutions at positions 239, 240, and 317 (M1/WTF3Shc) were isolated. Pooled transformants were used in all experiments. FD and M1 cell lines were grown, growth-arrested, and treated with either CSF-1 or IL-3 as described previously (16Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar, 27Marks D.C. Csar X.F. Wilson N.J. Novak U. Ward A.C. Kanagasundarum V. Hoffmann B.W. Hamilton J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). 5 × 104 cells were cytospun and subjected to May Grunwald Giemsa staining as described previously (27Marks D.C. Csar X.F. Wilson N.J. Novak U. Ward A.C. Kanagasundarum V. Hoffmann B.W. Hamilton J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pelleted cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 200 µm sodium orthovanadate, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and Pefabloc). The samples were centrifuged at 1300 rpm, 5 min in a Heraeus Biofuge 13 (Radiometer Pacific) and the pellets discarded. Immobiline dry strips (pH 3–10; linear; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were rehydrated overnight (8m urea, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) Pharmalytes 3–10, 0.01 m dithiothrietol). 100 µg of cell lysate, diluted 1:4 in sample solution (9 m urea, 0.06m dithiothreitol, 2% (v/v) Pharmalytes 3–10, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100), was applied to the rehydrated strips and run on a horizontal Multiphor II Electrophoresis unit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 20 °C for a total of 100,000 Vh. The second dimension separation was performed as described previously (29Csar X.F. Ward A.C. Hoffmann B.W. Guy G.G. Hamilton J.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Gels were analyzed by Western blotting as before (29Csar X.F. Ward A.C. Hoffmann B.W. Guy G.G. Hamilton J.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In some cases the blots were stripped of antibodies by extensive washing in stripping buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris/HCl, 0.1 mβ-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, blocked with a 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1% (w/v) ovalbumin solution for 1 h at room temperature, then re-probed with different antibodies as described elsewhere (30Csar X.F. Ward A.C. Hoffmann B.W. Guy G.G. Hamilton J.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Lysates were precleared by incubating 500 µg of Nonidet P-40 lysates, from appropriately treated cells, with 50 µl of a 25% (v/v) slurry of protein A-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with rotation for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min and the pellets discarded. They were then incubated with 1 µg of 4G10 antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) overnight with rotation at 4 °C. Fifty microliters of a 25% (v/v) slurry of protein A-Sepharose 4B was added and the mixture incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were pelleted and washed three times with cell lysis buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, subjected to one-dimensional SDS-PAGE on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. Membranes were stained with Colloidal Gold Total Protein Stain (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE gels were stained overnight with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Blue (PhastGel Blue R350 Stain; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 25% (v/v) methanol with 10% (v/v) acetic acid, destained in 25% (v/v) methanol with 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and dried. ECL autoradiographs were scanned using a computerized laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, CA) and the images analyzed using Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics). Nonidet P-40 lysates of unstimulated and CSF-1-stimulated (5 min) FD/WT and FD/807 cells were resolved by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with biotinylated 4G10 antibodies, and developed with streptavidin-conjugated HRPO. Cursory examination of the two-dimensional SDS-PAGE Western blots revealed dramatic up-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of many proteins following CSF-1 addition (Fig. 1, panels A–C). Coomassie Blue staining was used as an indication of the consistency of the loading and resolution (Fig. 1, panels DandE). Closer examination of the two-dimensional SDS-PAGE phosphoprotein profiles of FD/WT and FD/807 cells revealed both common and distinct tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins by CSF-1 (Fig. 1, panels A–C). Major phosphoproteins were classified on the basis of their molecular weights and pI. For example, a protein with a molecular mass of 74 kDa and a pI of 6.0 was designated 74/6.0 (Fig. 1,panels A–C). Each of the phosphoproteins or “spots” indicated in this fashion in Fig. 1 (panels A–C) was subjected to densitometric analysis and quantification (Fig.2). The CSF-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were classified as belonging to one of two groups: those whose tyrosine phosphorylation was consistently “unaffected” by the Y807F substitution and those whose tyrosine phosphorylation was consistently “affected.” These phosphorylation patterns are depicted qualitatively by a representative series of 4G10 antibody Western blots in Fig. 1, panels A–C. In each case, we have attempted to show as complete a two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gel as possible, focusing on the region of greatest interest, namely that containing the highest number of clearly identifiable affected and unaffected phosphoproteins. The average intensities, from five different experiments, are represented quantitatively in Fig. 2. As an example, spots 74/6.0, 67/7.8, 66/6.5, 64/5.8, 62/6.7, 62/5.9, 60/7.0, 27/7.4, and 27/6.7 belong to the unaffected group (Fig. 1, panels A–C; Fig. 2, panels A–I, respectively). The affected group was divided into those spots whose CSF-1-dependent phosphorylation state was “diminished” by the Y807F substitution or, alternatively, those whose CSF-1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation was “elevated” by the Y807F substitution. The diminished group included tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, 74/5.7, 66/6.1, 55/7.7, 52/6.9, 52/6.7, 46/6.3, 42/6.7, 37/6.7, 27/6.1, and 24/6.1 (Fig. 1,panels A–C; Fig. 2, panels J–S, respectively); the elevated group of molecules included the 100/8.5 and 100/8.0 (Fig.1, panels A–C; Fig. 2, panels T andU, respectively). Since the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the affected group of proteins correlates with a change in the capacity of the FD cells to differentiate in the presence of CSF-1, it is possible that proteins in this group may play a role in the differentiation process. The phosphorylation of spots 52/6.9, 52/6.7, and 46/6.3 was dramatically abrogated by the Y807F substitution (Figs. 1, panels A–C; Fig. 2, panels M–O, respectively). Their molecular weights suggested that these proteins might be p46/52Shc; however no such Y807F-dependent modulation in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of p46/52Shc was reported before in CSF-1-treated FD cells (9Lioubin M.N. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Bowtell D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5682Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We, therefore, addressed this question further. The two-dimensional SDS-PAGE blots were stripped and re-probed with anti-p46/52Shc antibodies. The identification of the 52/6.9, 52/6.7, and 46/6.3 proteins by both anti-p46/52Shcand 4G10 antibodies suggested that they were p46/52Shc and that the CSF-1-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation evident in FD/WT cells was abrogated in FD/807 cells (Fig.3). In addition to phosphoproteins 52/6.9, 52/6.7, and 46/6.3, which were all identified by p46/52Shc-reactive antibodies, a number of p46/52Shc proteins (Fig. 3, panelsD--F) did not appear to co-migrate with CSF-1-sensitive phosphoproteins (Fig. 3, panel B), suggesting that not all the p46/52Shc isoforms are phosphorylated. Similarly, the phosphorylation of the 52/6.9, 52/6.7, and 46/6.3 phosphoprotein p46/52Shc isoforms would appear to alter their pI mobility, probably by the addition of charged phosphate species. It is interesting to note that the pI distribution of p46/52Shc isoforms in unstimulated FD/WT and CSF-1-treated FD/807 cells are nearly identical, possibly corresponding to an “unphosphorylated” pattern and are different to that of CSF-1-treated FD/WT cells, which may represent a “phosphorylated” pattern. The identity of these phosphoproteins was further examined by amino acid sequence determination as described previously (31Csar X.F. Wilson N.J. Strike S. Sparrow L. McMahon K.A. Ward A.C. Hamilton J.A. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 435Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Consistent with data presented above, phosphoproteins 52/6.9, 52/6.7, and 46/6.3 were found to be the p46/52Shc adapter protein (data not shown). Given this result, we sought to determine directly whether p52Shc was tyrosine-phosphorylated to different degrees in FD/WT and FD/807 cells treated with CSF-1. Nonidet P-40 lysates from untreated and CSF-1-stimulated FD/WT and FD/807 cells were either immunoprecipitated with 4G10 or anti-p52Shc antibodies, resolved by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the converse antibody, that is, either anti-p52Shc or 4G10 (Fig. 4). Each approach revealed that the maximal CSF-1-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of p52Shc protein was dependent on the tyrosine at position 807 (Fig. 4). To determine whether this observation was simply cell type-specific we repeated the above examination with another murine myeloid cell system, namely the M1/WT and differentiation-deficient M1/807 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Again, the Y807F mutation in the CSF-1R resulted in a dramatically reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of p52Shc in response to CSF-1 treatment (Fig. 4). The combination of these approaches suggests that the Tyr at position 807 plays a part in p52Shc tyrosine phosphorylation rather than simply in the association, direct or otherwise, with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. As a check on the specificity of our observations for p52Shc, we examined, for each cell type, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase using the same approach and in this case found it to be CSF-1-dependent and Y807F mutation-independent (Fig. 4). These findings suggest that p52Shc may have a role in CSF-1-mediated macrophage differentiation in both of these cell systems. ERK family members can play a role in cellular differentiation (32Cook S.J. Aziz N. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 330Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 33Gredinger E. Gerber A.N. Tamir Y.

The loss of p46/52Shc binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor family member ErbB3 has been shown to result in the loss of ERK activation (38Mu S.X. Xia M. Elliott G. Bogenberger J. Swift S.

Accordingly, given the loss of p52Shc tyrosine phosphorylation following the Y807F substitution, we sought to examine the consequent effect of this mutation on ERK activity. The phospho-ERK immunoreactivity of M1/WT and M1/807 cells treated with CSF-1 for 4, 10, and 30 min was examined. The antibody binds specifically to the active forms of ERK and revealed that the Y807F mutation dramatically abrogated ERK activation (Fig.5). Interestingly, the specific MEK inhibitor, PD98059, inhibits both CSF-1-induced ERK activation and differentiation of M1 cells. 2N. J. Wilson, V. Kanangasundarum, S. T. Moss, G. Whittey, J. A.

Recently we have described activation of a volume-sensitive, outwardly rectifying chloride conductance (I(OR)) through the src-like tyrosine kinase p56(lck). Here we show that p56(lck) activates I(OR) independently of CFTR. In lymphocytes from healthy donors, chloride channels could be opened by either intracellular cAMP, p56(lck) or osmotic swelling. In CF lymphocytes, p56(lck) and cell swelling but not cAMP could activate chloride channels. Regulation of I(OR) by p56(lck) thus represents an alternative pathway of stimulating membrane chloride conductance that is left intact in cystic fibrosis."

However, exposure to schistosome egg antigen (SEA) for < or =4 h induced strong receptor expression. Experiments using splenocytes fractionated with antibody-coupled, paramagnetic beads showed that induction localized exclusively to T cells. Receptor protein expression was confirmed with Western blot. Interleukin 12 (IL-12) also induced strong T-cell SPr expression. Both SEA and IL-12 remained strong inducers of T-cell SPr in lymphocytes from the IL-12 (p40) and IFN-gamma R double-knockout mouse, which suggested that SEA did not require IL-12 to induce SPr and that both worked independently of IFN-gamma. Splenocytes from wild-type mice cultured with SEA and neutralizing anti-IL-12 monoclonal antibody (mAb) also showed SPr induction. However, anti-Ia mAb inhibited SEA induction of SPR: Thus, SPr is inducible on T cells. SEA induces SPr through interaction with T-cell receptor (TCR), independently of IL-12 and IFN-gamma. IL-12 induces SPr independently of TCR activation and IFN-gamma expression. SP and its receptor, which regulate IFN-gamma production, are probably part of the IL-12-Th1 circuit."

Alternatively, the persisting m6G can be cytotoxic through lethal interactions with the mismatch repair pathway in mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 4Bignami M. O'Driscoll M. Aquilina G. Karran P.

Loss ofO 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity results in the persistence of unrepaired m6G lesions, and such cells are sensitive to killing by alkylating agents. Additional loss of mismatch repair proteins rendersO 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase-deficient cells tolerant of the cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents (5Hampson R. Humbert O. Macpherson P.

In one model, mismatch repair activity causes persistent DNA strand breaks which signal cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (4Bignami M. O'Driscoll M. Aquilina G. Karran P. Mutat.

Replicative and repair-associated DNA polymerases contain 3′ → 5′ proofreading exonucleases, which act in coordination with the polymerase activity to enhance the efficiency of error discrimination. Despite the critical role of polymerases in mediating DNA damage mutagenesis, little is known regarding the biochemistry of this polymerase exonuclease activity at DNA lesions. Eukaryotic DNA polymerases δ and ε contain the polymerase domain and the exonuclease domain within the same polypeptide. Thus, during DNA synthesis, the nascent 3′-primer terminus must be shuttled between the two active sites in order for excision to occur. In studies using 2-aminopurine fluorescence, the rate-limiting step in excision by the T4 polymerase is translocation of the DNA from the polymerase to the exonuclease site (8Reha-Krantz L.J.

Part of the molecular “switch” for this process is thought to be the structure of the DNA (10Morales J.C. Kool E.T.

The preferred DNA substrate for the polymerase domain is base-paired duplex DNA, whereas that for the exonuclease is melted duplex DNA containing a few single-stranded bases. Any factor that destabilizes duplex DNA is expected to enhance the exonuclease catalytic rate relative to the polymerase catalytic rate. For example, the significant distortion of DNA within the DNA polymerase binding cleft may destabilize duplex DNA and enhance excision by affecting the equilibrium between single-stranded and double-stranded states (13Beese L.S. Derbyshire V. Steitz T.A. Science. 1993; 260: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar).

Structurally, the m6G·T mispair simulates Watson-Crick alignments, and the m6G·T pair is indistinguishable in the minor groove from G·C (reviewed in Ref. 18Swann P.F.

Thermodynamically, however, the m6G·T pair is less stable than both the m6G·C and G·T pairs in DNA and displays a lower melting temperature (15Leonard G.A. Thomson J. Watson W.P. Brown T. Proc. Natl.

We report here the efficiency of exonuclease removal of m6G and other alkylation mispairs and the resulting effects on alkylation-induced errors by the T4 DNA polymerase. Wild type and D219A T4 DNA polymerases were gifts of Dr. Stephen Benkovic (Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA). The D324A T4 polymerase was a gift of Dr. Linda Reha-Krantz (University of Alberta, Edmundton, Canada). All enzymes for molecular biology procedures were supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. and used according to the manufacturer's protocol.N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine were purchased from Sigma. DNA primer-templates were made by hybridizing combinations of synthetic oligonucleotides in which the 33-mer template oligonucleotide (HPLC-purified, Midland Certified Reagents, Midland, TX) had either a G or a site-specific m6G adduct, and the complementary 15-mer primer oligonucleotides (gel-purified; Pierce) contained either a terminal C or T residue: template, 3′-CGGCACGCCTGGCT(G/m6G)CTAGATTTGGGCGTGATC-5′; nonmutagenic primer, 5′-GCCGTGCGGACCGAC-3′; mutagenic primer, 5′-GCCGTGCGGACCGAT-3′ (boldface type indicates location of differences between substrates). The presence of m6G in the final template preparation was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry by the manufacturer. The 15-mer primers were labeled at the 5′-end using [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's protocol. The labeled primers were annealed with the template oligonucleotides by combining 1:3 primer-template molar ratios of each DNA in the presence of SSC. The mixtures were heated at 75 °C for 5 min and gradually cooled to room temperature. The primer-template preparations were purified using G25 Sephadex Quickspin columns prior to use. The exonuclease reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-OAc (pH 7.4), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 150 mm KOAc, 10 nm DNA primer-template, and 0.5 nm enzyme. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and were incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated times, aliquots were added to an equal volume of stop solution (containing 20 mm EDTA and 90% formamide) to terminate the reactions. Reaction products were separated through a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Band intensities were quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The radioactivity at respective time points was normalized to the amount of radioactivity in the control (no polymerase) lane. T4 polymerase partitioning assays were carried out in the presence of either 200 μm dGTP (next correct nucleotide) or 200 μmfour dNTPs, 5 or 50 nm wild-type enzyme, and 10 nm primer-template using the reaction buffer described above. Aliquots were removed at the indicated time points and quenched, and the products were separated on a 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. For reactions containing dGTP only, radioactivity was measured for unmodified substrate (n), and extension (n + 1) or excision (n − 1, n − 2) products. For reactions containing all four dNTP substrates, radioactivity was measured for full-length (33-mer) product, intermediate extension products (16–32-mer), and excision products (n − 1,n − 2), relative to the total radioactivity in each sample. The experimental conditions used for the D324A extension assay were the same as above, except the protein concentration was 5 μm. Alkylated DNA substrates were created by random MNU modification (Me2SO solvent) of primed, single-stranded DNA synthesis templates and purified prior to use in the polymerase reactions, as previously described (20Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Vargo P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thein vitro reactions for mutational analyses contained 2 pmol of ssDNA template at 40 nm concentration. Reaction conditions were 50 mm Tris-OAc (pH 7.4) or 25 mm Hepes-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm KOAc, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm dNTPs, and 40 pmol of T4 polymerase. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and terminated with 15 mm EDTA. The extent of DNA synthesis was determined by parallel reactions (0.2 pmol of DNA; same molar ratios of enzyme to substrate as above) supplemented with 5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol). A 64-mer oligonucleotide oligonucleotide was radiolabeled at the 5′-end using [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and 50 fmol were added to each reaction after termination for use as an internal loading standard. The DNA products were analyzed on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel together with a DNA sequencing ladder generated from the same primer-template, followed by PhosphorImager analysis. The amount of synthesis in each reaction was normalized first to the internal standard and then to the solvent-treated control for each polymerase. No reaction products less than 210 nucleotides in length were observed for any polymerase with either solvent or MNU treatment. Mutational analyses of the reaction products were performed as reported previously (20Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Vargo P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ssDNA synthesis products were digested with EcoRV andMluI restriction enzymes, and 203-base pair double-stranded products were purified. An equivalent yield of product (50–100 ng; 0.4–0.8 pmol), as estimated by gel electrophoresis, was obtained for all solvent and MNU-treated polymerase reactions. These fragments were hybridized to gapped duplex molecules (0.05 pmol) containing one chloramphenicol-resistant strand and one chloramphenicol-sensitive strand. To select for HSV-tk mutations, an aliquot of the final hybridization was used to transform recA13,upp, tdk E. coli strain FT334 by electroporation and plated on VBA-selective media. Progeny of the DNA strand produced during in vitro synthesis were selected with 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and HSV-tk mutant plasmids were selected with 40 μm5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine. The HSV-tk mutant frequency is defined as the number of 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine + chloramphenicol-resistant colonies divided by the total number of chloramphenicol-resistant (CmR) colonies. In the experiments presented here, a total of 0.14–3 × 105 CmR transformants (solvent treatment) and 0.06–6 × 105 CmRtransformants (MNU treatment) were analyzed for mutants for each polymerase. Mutational spectra were derived from independent mutants, as described (21Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Mutat. Res. 1998; 422: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Differences in proportions of specific types of errors were analyzed statistically using Fisher's exact test (two-tailed). The intrinsic exonuclease activity of T4 polymerase on various natural and m6G-containing templates was examined by incubating the enzyme and DNA in the absence of dNTP substrates. As expected for control templates, the T4 exonuclease activity exhibited “proofreading” activity by degrading terminal G·T mispair-containing substrates with a greater efficiency (t 12 ∼6 min) than correctly paired G·C-containing substrates (t 12 ∼60 min), under enzyme-limiting conditions (Fig. 1). In contrast, the exonuclease exhibited little or no discrimination between the two m6G-containing substrates. Both m6G·C and m6G·T substrates were degraded with similar efficiencies (t 12 ∼4.5 min and 4 min, respectively), near that observed for the G·T mispaired substrate (Fig. 1). More rapid excision was observed for all four substrates during the first minute of the reaction, compared with later times. This observation may reflect the high processivity of the T4 exonuclease, since excision of the 15-mer primers was complete under the substrate excess conditions utilized. These results show that although m6G-containing templates are substrates for the T4 exonuclease activity, this activity may not contribute a significant “proofreading” function to DNA polymerase errors, because both m6G·C and m6G·T substrates are excised with similar efficiencies. Partitioning of the T4 enzyme between the polymerase and exonuclease activities was assayed in the presence of the next correct nucleotide, dGTP (Fig.2). The correctly paired natural substrate (G·C) was efficiently extended by the enzyme with minimal exonuclease degradation. In contrast, polymerase activity was highly inhibited using a mispaired G·T substrate (<1% extension), relative to the paired substrate (90% extension), and exonucleolytic degradation products were predominant over the time course analyzed. However, inclusion of m6G in the substrate eliminated this discrimination, and the exonuclease activity predominated in reactions containing either the m6G·C or the m6G·T substrate (Fig. 2,C and D). The 3′ → 5′ exonuclease assays (Figs. 1 and 2) demonstrate that this activity could excise both nonmutagenic (C) and mutagenic (T) bases incorporated opposite m6G lesions. We next examined whether the polymerase or the exonuclease activity predominates in the presence of all four dNTP substrates (Fig. 3). Experiments performed using natural G templates with or without a mispaired primer terminus resulted in the accumulation of full-length product (Fig. 3,A and B). As expected, the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity was not detectable in the presence of the G·C substrate and 200 μm dNTPs. However, using the mispaired G·T substrate, excision products accumulated during the initial time points with little extension (Fig. 3 B). With increased time of incubation, full-length product accumulated concomitant with disappearance of excision bands, suggesting that efficient extension occurred only after complete excision of the terminal mispaired thymine. The enzyme polymerization activity was found to be highly inhibited using lesion-containing templates. For both m6G·C and m6G·T substrates, excision products persisted throughout the course of the reaction and predominated over extension products (Fig. 3, Cand D). Increasing the enzyme concentration 10-fold (enzyme excess conditions) did not affect the polymerase/exonuclease balance, since the ratio of extension/excision products remained ∼1:1 (TableI). Accumulation of the 15-mer products probably results from the repeated cycles of incorporation and excision of bases at the lesion-containing primer terminus. In order to examine the m6G substrate preference of the polymerase activity, extension of m6G-containing substrates was examined using the exonuclease-compromised D324A T4 polymerase (Fig. 3, E andF). The enzyme was found to extend the m6G·T substrate somewhat more efficiently than the m6G·C substrate (Table I). However, even under these large enzyme excess conditions, the m6G lesion is inhibitory to the T4 polymerase, since 20–50% of the substrates remained unextended. The appearance of excision products (Fig. 3, E and F) may represent either residual exonuclease activity or nonenzymatic cleavage in the presence of Tris buffer, as has been reported by others (22Elisseeva E.

In the biochemical assays, we observed a similar yield of full-length reaction products for both the nonmutagenic (m6G·C) and mutagenic (m6G·T) substrates (Fig. 3). In order to quantitate the extent to which the exonuclease contributes to error avoidance, we performed the in vitro HSV-tk forward mutation assay (20Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Vargo P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The wild-type, proofreading-proficient enzyme was compared with two proofreading-deficient forms: D324A, which exhibits a 104 to 105-fold reduction in exonuclease activity, and D219A, which exhibits a 103-fold reduction in exonuclease activity (22Elisseeva E. Mandal S. Reha-Krantz L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25151-25158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 23Sattar A.K.M.A. Lin T.-C. Jones C. Konigsberg W.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16621-16629Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At 200 μm dNTPs, using unmodified DNA templates, the mutation frequency for wild-type T4 polymerase was 2.4 ± 0.72 × 10−4, approximately 5-fold lower than either the D324A (21 × 10−4) or the D219A (10 ± 2.5 × 10−4) exonuclease-deficient enzymes and near the background for this assay (20Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Vargo P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the HSV-tk forward mutation assay, chemically treated, oligonucleotide-primed ssDNA is used as a template for DNA polymerase reactions. The DNA reaction products are digested with restriction enzymes, and a 203-base pair DNA synthesis product is purified. To recover and analyze these DNA fragments for the presence of mutations, a gapped duplex molecule is used that is formed by hybridization of a linear chloramphenicol-resistant DNA fragment to a chloramphenicol-sensitive ssDNA. DNA synthesis fragments containing potential mutations within the thymidine kinase gene are rescued by hybridization to the gapped duplex, forming heteroduplex plasmid molecules that are used to transform E. coli. Incubation of the transformed bacteria in the presence of chloramphenicol selects progeny of the DNA strand synthesized in vitro (20Eckert K.A. Hile S.E. Vargo P.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1450-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HSV-tk mutant plasmids are selected by plating the bacteria in the presence of 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine. The resulting HSV-tk mutant frequency is a measure of the proportion of DNA fragments containing mutations. Modification of oligonucleotide-primed single-stranded DNA templates with MNU resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis for the three polymerases. However, at low levels of modification, the inhibition of synthesis observed for the wild-type polymerase was greater than that observed for either exonuclease-deficient enzyme (Fig.4 A). Genetic analyses of the reaction products from these modification reactions are shown in Fig.4 B. For the wild-type polymerase, a linear mutationversus dose-response curve was observed, with a 30-fold increased frequency at 5 mm MNU (110 ± 39 × 10−4), relative to solvent control (3.6 ± 3.9 × 10−4). We repeated the wild-type dose-response curve in Hepes buffer to eliminate potential nonenzymatic exonuclease activity, and again observed a 37-fold increased mutation frequency at 5 mm MNU (270 × 10−4), relative to solvent-treated templates (7.3 × 10−4). The mutation rate (defined by the slope of the dose-response curves) of the D324A polymerase was 7-fold greater than that of wild-type T4, while that of the D219A was 2-fold greater than wild-type (Fig. 4 B). At the highest dose tested (5 mm MNU), the absolute mutation frequencies measured for the D324A and D219A polymerases were 740 × 10−4 and 250 × 10−4, respectively. Comparison of the wild-type and exonuclease-deficient dose-response curves demonstrates that the exonuclease of T4 polymerase is able to remove 50–86% of total alkylation mispairs. Random modification of ssDNA by MNU results in alkylation at template bases in the order: G ≫ A > C (24Singer B. Grunberger D. Molecular Biology of Mutagens and Carcinogens. Plenum Press, New York1983: 67Google Scholar). DNA sequence analyses revealed that the wild-type enzyme produced exclusively G → A transition mutations using alkylated templates (Fig. 5). The frequency of G → A transition mutations at 5 mm MNU treatment was increased 2000-fold, relative to solvent treatment (TableII). At the same dose, the G → A mutation frequency for the D324A polymerase was 2.6-fold higher than that for the wild-type polymerase (Table II), indicating that the exonuclease activity removed only ∼38% of m6G·T mispairs. Inspection of the mutational spectra derived from all three forms of the T4 polymerase reveals that the majority of errors removed by the exonuclease involve methylated C and A lesions (Table II). In the D324A spectrum, eight mutational events (26%) induced by MNU were C → T transitions. This corresponds to a frequency of 2.3 × 10−2, nearly equivalent to the G → A frequency and 190-fold greater than the solvent-treated control frequency. Other prevalent mutations in the D219A and D324A MNU-induced spectra include C → A transversions (18 and 10%, respectively), A → T transversions (15 and 10%, respectively), and one-base deletions at template A (7 and 22%, respectively).Table IIMutational specificity of wild-type and 3′ → 5′ exonuclease-deficient T4 polymerasesT4 polymeraseDNA treatmentHSV-tk mutation frequency × 10−4 (no. observed)Base substitutionsFrameshiftsG → AC → TA → TC → AMinus AOtherWild typeSolvent2-aOther mutations were one A → G, two G → T base substitutions, two complex mutations, and three insertions (23 total mutational events; f = 1.4 × 10−4).0.06 (1)0.37 (6)<0.06 (0)<0.06 (0)0.06 (1)0.43 (7)MNU2-b20 total mutational events;f = 120 × 10−4.120 (20)<6 (0)<6 (0)<6 (0)<6 (0)<6 (0)D324ASolvent2-cOther mutation: one T → A base substitution (10 total mutational events; f = 12 × 10−4).3.6 (3)<1.2 (0)<1.2 (0)2.4 (2)<1.2 (0)4.8 (4)MNU2-dOther mutations were one A → C, one G → T base substitutions, one deletion (31 total mutational events; f = 890 × 10−4).320 (11)230 (8)86 (3)86 (3)86 (3)<29 (0)Independent FUdR-resistant transformants were obtained by electroporation of E. coli with DNA synthesis products from the HSV-tk in vitro forward mutational assays (Fig. 4) and selective plating as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DNA treatment refers to modification of the primed ssDNA template prior to the polymerase reactions (solvent = Me2SO; MNU = 5 mm dose).

The frequency of each mutational event was calculated by multiplying the proportion of total mutants by the overall mutation frequency for the corresponding polymerase reaction. Our results demonstrate that the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase recognizes and removes both dCMP and dTMP incorporated opposite a defined m6G lesion (Figs. 1 and 2). This activity results in severe DNA synthesis inhibition at the lesion in the presence of dNTP substrates, due to repeated cycles of incorporation and excision (Fig. 3). Consistent with this, we observed less DNA synthesis inhibition for exonuclease-deficient forms of the T4 polymerase, relative to the wild-type enzyme, using MNU-treated DNA templates (Fig. 4 A). Genetic analyses demonstrate that the exonuclease removes ∼38% of the mutagenic m6G·T mispairs but virtually 100% of other types of alkyl-directed mispairs (Fig. 5 and Table II). Our observations can be explained by taking into account the differential basis of substrate discrimination by the polymerase and exonuclease enzymatic activities. As has been observed previously by others (2Reha-Krantz L.J. Nonay III, R.L. R. S.D. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20088-20095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), exonuclease-deficient T4 polymerase displays a preference for extension of m6G·T over m6G·C substrates (Fig. 3), consistent with a polymerase activity that discriminates on the basis of structural configuration of bases (18Swann P.F. Mutation Res. 1990; 233: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Physical determinations have shown that the m6G·C base pair is in altered wobble geometry, while the mutagenic m6G·T base pair simulates Watson-Crick geometry. In contrast, we observed that the T4 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity displayed little discrimination between nonmutagenic and mutagenic base pairs opposite the m6G lesion, and both were excised as efficiently as the natural G·T mispair (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with a thermodynamic mechanism of substrate recognition by the exonuclease. Both m6G·C and m6G·T base pairs are less stable than correct G·C (ΔΔG = 46 and 46.8 kJ/mol, respectively) (15Leonard G.A. Thomson J. Watson W.P. Brown T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9573-9576Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Moreover, the m6G·T base pair is of equivalent stability as an m6G·C base pair (ΔΔG = 0.8 kJ/mol), whereas the natural G·T base pair is substantially less stable than a G·C base pair (ΔΔG = 30.9 kJ/mol). Thus, the significant thermodynamic difference for correctly paired and mispaired natural bases is eliminated by formation of the m6G lesion. Interestingly, we observed that the exonuclease activity was highly effective in removing alkylated mispairs at template A and C residues, resulting in a 7-fold reduction in the MNU-induced T4 polymerase mutation frequency (Fig. 5and Table II). The premutagenic lesions for these mutational events have not been defined by site-specific lesion studies. However, the nearly 200- and 40-fold increases in the frequency of C → T transitions and C → A transversions, respectively, observed for the D324A enzyme upon MNU treatment are consistent with earlier studies demonstrating misincorporation of dAMP > TMP on methylated poly(dC) templates (25Saffhill R. Margison G. O'Connor P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 823: 111-145PubMed Google Scholar). We presume that the premutagenic lesion for these events is 3meC, which is formed in significant amounts by MNU modification of single-stranded DNA (24Singer B. Grunberger D. Molecular Biology of Mutagens and Carcinogens. Plenum Press, New York1983: 67Google Scholar). The mutational events at methylated A residues may result from 1meA adducts (25Saffhill R. Margison G. O'Connor P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 823: 111-145PubMed Google Scholar) and/or apurinic sites resulting from spontaneous decay of 7meA lesions. Alkylation of purine and pyrimidine base pairing positions may destabilize the primer/terminus, allowing for efficient exonuclease removal. DNA alkylation lesions inhibit forward DNA synthesis by 3′ → 5′ exonuclease-proficient DNA polymerases (Fig. 4 A; Ref. 26Larson K. Sahm J. Shenkar R. Strauss B. Mutat. Res. 1985; 150: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our biochemical observations (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) indicate that the exonuclease activity acts as a kinetic barrier to DNA synthesis on m6G lesion-containing templates by preventing accumulation of 3′-terminal m6G substrates. Furthermore, the m6G·C and m6G·T intermediates are extended inefficiently by T4 polymerase. However, the presence of m6G is not an absolute barrier to DNA synthesis, since we observed 3% full-length product with wild-type T4 polymerase in the presence of 200 μm dNTPs at approximately equimolar concentrations of enzyme and DNA (Table I). Moreover, the presence of accessory proteins may enhance the ability of T4 polymerase to synthesize past lesions, as has been observed for E. coli polIII (27Tomer G. Reuven N.B. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14106-14111Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and pol δ (28Mozzherin D.J. Shibutani S. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. Fisher P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6126-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in the presence of their cognate processivity factors. Recent evidence in S. cerevisiae has led to the suggestion that specific translesion synthesis polymerases may assist in overcoming m6G inhibition (29Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8001-8007Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Together, these biochemical observations are consistent with in vivo data demonstrating that m6G-mediated cytotoxicity is not observed in the first S phase after alkylation treatment (30Kaina B. Ziouta A. Ochs K. Coquerelle T. Mutat. Res. 1997; 381: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 31Zhukovskaya N. Branch P. Aquilina G. Karran P. Carcinogenesis. 1994; 15: 2189-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the idling we observed at the site of m6G, which we interpret as repeated cycles of base incorporation and exonuclease excision, could lead to disruption of local dCTP and TTP pools during DNA replication, resulting in a biochemical signal for cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. The most profound implication of the idling by proofreading-proficient polymerases at sites of m6G lesions is during repair DNA synthesis. In eukaryotic cells, m6G has been suggested to be cytotoxic when used as a substrate by mismatch repair enzymes, in what has been termed a “futile cycle.” In this model, DNA repair of the strand opposite the lesion will produce an m6G-containing gapped DNA substrate for either polymerase δ or polymerase ε (32Karran P. Macpherson P. Ceccotti S. Dogliotti E. Griffin S. Bignami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15878-15886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the lesion in this gap will severely inhibit the efficiency of DNA repair synthesis, since we have observed that less than 10% of m6G-containing templates give rise to full-length product by wild-type T4 polymerase. Our observations provide a biochemical explanation for how persistent gaps arise in genomic DNA from methylated substrates. Moreover, human cell lines have been reported that areO 6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase-deficient and mismatch repair-proficient yet exhibit full resistance to the cytotoxic action of MNU (5Hampson R. Humbert O. Macpherson P. Aquilina G. Karran P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28596-28606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Extrapolating our data, these cell lines may harbor a mutation in the exonuclease domain of polymerase δ or polymerase ε that alleviates the idling and thus the cytotoxicity of MNU. Our study demonstrates the biochemical significance of the polymerase-associated 3′ → 5′ exonuclease activity in processing alkylation adducts, particularly the m6G lesion. The idling we observed opposite m6G could have implications for improving the therapeutic potential of chemotherapeutic agents. Nucleoside analogs or DNA adducts that thermodynamically destabilize the nascent DNA are expected to be substrates for the exonuclease activity; thus, the most effective cytotoxic agents will be those that produce substrates favored by the exonuclease domain over the polymerase domain, as has been observed for the prototype m6G lesion.

DU6i is characterized by high body mass and obesity associated with hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia, and elevated serum IGF-I concentrations. Furthermore, significantly elevated serum levels of IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-4 were found in DU6i vs. DBA/2 mice. Linkage analysis identified loci with major effects on the serum level of IGFBP-3 on Chromosome 5 at 58 cM (Igfbp3q1; F = 9.9) and on Chromosome 10 at 46 cM (Igfbp3q2; F = 33.8). A locus significantly influencing serum IGFBP-2 levels in males was found on Chromosome 7. Additional linkage was detected in males and females for IGFBP-2 on Chromosomes 8, 11, 14, 17, and X, and for IGFBP-4 on Chromosome 4. Additional loci affecting IGFBPs acted in a sex-specific manner. The identified loci coincide in part with chromosomal regions controlling growth and obesity. Thus, multiple genes or pleiotropic gene effects may be assumed for these chromosomal regions. The identification of quantitative trait loci for IGFBPs as subcomponents of growth regulation and differentiation will further improve the understanding of complex trait regulation."
