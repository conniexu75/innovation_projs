https://openalex.org/W3160856701,"Oral swab analysis (OSA) has been shown to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) DNA in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). In previous analyses, qPCR testing of swab samples collected from tongue dorsa was up to 93% sensitive relative to sputum GeneXpert, when 2 swabs per patient were tested. The present study modified sample collection methods to increase sample biomass and characterized the viability of bacilli present in tongue swabs. A qPCR targeting conserved bacterial ribosomal rRNA gene (rDNA) sequences was used to quantify bacterial biomass in samples. There was no detectable reduction in total bacterial rDNA signal over the course of 10 rapidly repeated tongue samplings, indicating that swabs collect only a small portion of the biomass available for testing. Copan FLOQSwabs collected ~2-fold more biomass than Puritan PurFlock swabs, the best brand used previously (p = 0.006). FLOQSwabs were therefore evaluated in patients with possible TB in Uganda. A FLOQSwab was collected from each patient upon enrollment (Day 1) and, in a subset of sputum GeneXpert Ultra-positive patients, a second swab was collected on the following day (Day 2). Swabs were tested for MTB DNA by manual IS6110-targeted qPCR. Relative to sputum GeneXpert Ultra, single-swab sensitivity was 88% (44/50) on Day 1 and 94.4% (17/18) on Day 2. Specificity was 79.2% (42/53). Among an expanded sample of Ugandan patients, 62% (87/141) had colony-forming bacilli in their tongue dorsum swab samples. These findings will help guide further development of this promising TB screening method."
https://openalex.org/W3160330004,"The tumor microenvironment is deeply involved in the process of tumor growth and development. In this study, we focused on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their derived exosomes on the lymphoma microenvironment to uncover their clinical significance. CAFs were established from primary lymphoma samples, and exosomes secreted from CAFs were obtained by standard procedures. We then investigated the roles of CAFs and their derived exosomes in the survival and drug resistance of lymphoma cells. CAFs supported the survival of lymphoma cells through increased glycolysis, and the extent differed among CAFs. Exosomes were identified as a major component of the extracellular vesicles from CAFs, and they also supported the survival of lymphoma cells. The suppression of RAB27B, which is involved in the secretion of exosomes, using a specific siRNA resulted in reduced exosome secretion and decreased survival of lymphoma cells. Moreover, anti-pyrimidine drug resistance was induced in the presence of exosomes through the suppression of the pyrimidine transporter, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2 (ENT2), and the suppression of ENT2 was significant in in vivo experiments and clinical samples. RNA sequencing analysis of miRNAs in exosomes identified miR-4717-5p as one of the most abundant miRNAs in the exosome, which suppressed the expression of ENT2 and induced anti-pyrimidine drug resistance in vitro. Our results suggest that exosomes including miR-4717-5p secreted from CAFs play a pivotal role in the lymphoma microenvironment, indicating that they are a promising therapeutic target."

The present study aimed to evaluate the rhythm disruptions of life, work, and entertainment, and their associations with the psychological impacts during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted from the 10 th to 17 th March 2020 in China. A structured e-questionnaire containing general information, the Chinese version of Brief Social Rhythm Scale, and Zung’s self-rating scales of depression and anxiety (SDS and SAS) was posted and collected online through a public media ( i . e . EQxiu online questionnaire platform). Scores in sleeping, getting up, and socializing (SGS) rhythm and eating, physical practice, and entertainment (EPE) rhythm were compared among and between participants with different sociodemographic backgrounds including gender, age, education, current occupation, annual income, health status, and chronic disease status. Correlations of SDS and SAS with SGS-scale and EPE-scale were also analyzed. Results Overall, 5854 participants were included. There were significant differences in the scores of SGS-scale and EPE-scale among people with different sociodemographic backgrounds. The scores were significantly higher in the groups with female gender, low education level, lower or higher than average income, poor health status, ages of 26–30 years or older than 61 years, nurses and subjects with divorce or widow status. There were also significant differences in SAS and SDS scores among people with different sociodemographic backgrounds (all P &lt; 0.05). The overall prevalence of depression and anxiety was 24.3% and 12.6%, respectively, with nurses having the highest rates of depression (32.94%) and anxiety (18.98%) among the different occupational groups. SGS-scale was moderately correlated with SDS and SAS, and disruption of SGS rhythm was an independent risk factor for depression and anxiety. Conclusion Social rhythm disruption was independently associated with depression and anxiety. Interventions should be applied to people vulnerable to the rhythm disruption during the COVID-19 pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3161232216,"HIV-related stigma is a frequently cited barrier to HIV testing and care engagement. A nuanced understanding of HIV-related stigma is critical for developing stigma-reduction interventions to optimize HIV-related outcomes. This qualitative study documented HIV-related stigma across eight communities in east Africa during the baseline year of a large HIV test-and-treat trial (SEARCH, NCT: 01864603), prior to implementation of widespread community HIV testing campaigns and efforts to link individuals with HIV to care and treatment. Findings revealed experiences of enacted, internalized and anticipated stigma that were highly gendered, and more pronounced in communities with lower HIV prevalence; women, overwhelmingly, both held and were targets of stigmatizing attitudes about HIV. Past experiences with enacted stigma included acts of segregation, verbal discrimination, physical violence, humiliation and rejection. Narratives among women, in particular, revealed acute internalized stigma including feelings of worthlessness, shame, embarrassment, and these resulted in anxiety and depression, including suicidality among a small number of women. Anticipated stigma included fears of marital dissolution, verbal and physical abuse, gossip and public ridicule. Anticipated stigma was especially salient for women who held internalized stigma and who had experienced enacted stigma from their partners. Anticipated stigma led to care avoidance, care-seeking at remote facilities, and hiding of HIV medications. Interventions aimed at reducing individual and community-level forms of stigma may be needed to improve the lives of PLHIV and fully realize the promise of test-and-treat strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3162811820,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently the critical health problem of the globe, including Ethiopia. Visitors of healthcare facilities are the high-risk groups due to the presence of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting. Increasing the knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19 prevention among hospital visitors are very important to prevent transmissions of the pandemic despite the lack of evidence remains a challenge in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the status of knowledge, attitude, and preventive practice towards COVID-19 and associated factors among hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed during August 1 to 30, 2020 from randomly selected 404 adult hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. The data was collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire. The outcome of this study was good or poor knowledge, positive or negative attitude and good or poor preventive practice towards COVID-19. Three different binary logistic regression models with 95% CI (Confidence interval) was used for data analysis. For each mode, bivariable analysis (crude odds ratio [COR]) and multivariable analysis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) was used during data analysis. From the bivariable analysis, variables with a p -value &lt;0.25 were retained into the multivariable logistic regression analysis. From the multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables with a significance level of p -value &lt;0.05 were taken as factors independently associated with knowledge, attitude and preventive practices towards COVID-19. Main findings About 69.3% of the respondents had good knowledge, 62.6% had a positive attitude, and 49.3% had good preventive practice towards the prevention of COVID-19. We found that factors significantly associated with good knowledge about COVID-19 were educational status who can read and write (AOR = 2.78; 95%CI: 1.18–6.56) and college and above (AOR = 6.15; 95%CI: 2.18–17.40), and use of social media (AOR = 2.96; 95%CI: 1.46–6.01). Furthermore, factors significantly associated with a positive attitude towards COVID-19 includes the presence of chronic illnesses (AOR = 5.00; 95%CI; 1.71–14.67), training on COVID-19 (AOR = 3.91; 95%CI: 1.96–7.70), and peer/family as a source of information (AOR = 2.45; 95%CI: 1.06–5.63). Being a student (AOR = 7.70; 95%CI: 1.15–15.86) and participants who had a good knowledge on COVID-19 (AOR = 4.49; 95%CI: 2.41–8.39) were factors significantly associated with good practice towards COVID-19. Conclusion We found that knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices towards prevention of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors were low. Therefore, we recommended that different intervention strategies for knowledge, attitude and preventive practices are urgently needed to control the transmission of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors. Health education of those who could not read and write about COVID-19 knowledge issues and advocating use of social media that transmit messages about COVID-19 are highly encouraged to increase the good knowledge status of adult hospital visitors. Furthermore, providing training about COVID-19 prevention methods and using various sources of information about COVID-19 will help for improving positive attitude towards COVID-19 prevention, whereas for increasing the status of good preventive practices towards COVID-19, improving the good knowledge about COVID-19 of adult hospital visitors are essential."
https://openalex.org/W3163564719,"Early termination of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and postpartum depression (PPD) are both recognized as global health problems. Recent literature reviews demonstrate a notable link between PPD and breastfeeding outcomes, however, the underlying mechanisms linking the two remain unclear.The aim of the study is to: 1) explore the comparative risk for PPD among new mothers who terminated EBF before the 6-month mark, compared to those who did not; and 2) test whether maternal stress and social support operate to mediate and/or moderate the relationship between EBF and PPD.Between October 2015 and January 2016, a cross-sectional study was carried out among 426 new mothers of Bangladesh who were six months postpartum.Based on the multivariate logistic regression model, non-exclusively breastfeeding mothers were 7.58-fold more likely to experience PPD (95% CI [3.94, 14.59]) than exclusively breastfeeding mothers. Additionally, maternal stress and social support not only partially mediate the relationship between EBF and PPD but also substantially moderate this relationship. Specifically, the odds of PPD are significantly higher among mothers who had early EBF interruption in conjunction with increased stress levels and limited social support.Current evidence suggests that concurrent screening for EBF difficulties and maternal stress are important red flags that might hint at complications even before mother's screen positive for PPD. Support and care from family members can provide assistance in overcoming this issue."
https://openalex.org/W3162611287,"A maternal near-miss (MNM) refers to when a gravely ill woman survives a complication as a result of the standard of care she receives or by chance during gestation, childbirth, or within 42 days of the termination of pregnancy. Rescuers of near-miss events share several features with mothers who have died and identifying MNM determinants will aid in improving the capacity of the health system to reduce severe maternal morbidity and mortality. Ethiopia is one of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa with high maternal mortality and morbidity, but there is little evidence on determinants of a MNM based on a WHO criteria. Hence, this study aimed at identifying determinants of MNM among women admitted to tertiary hospitals in southern Ethiopia, 2020.A facilities-based unmatched case-control study was conducted in five selected tertiary hospitals found in central southern Ethiopia from February 1 to June 1, 2020. A total of 322 (81 cases and 241 controls) study participants were included in the study. At the time of their discharge, cases were recruited consecutively, while controls were selected using a systematic sampling method. The cases were women admitted to hospitals during pregnancy, childbirth, or 42 days following termination of pregnancy who met at least one of the WHO near-miss criteria. Whereas the controls comprised of women who were admitted during pregnancy, childbirth, or 42 days following termination of pregnancy and discharged without severe obstetric complications. Data collection was conducted using the interviewer-administered structured questionnaire and data abstraction tool. The data was coded and entered into Epi-Data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted and determinants of MNM were established at p-value<0.05.Severe postpartum hemorrhage (50.6%) and sepsis (23.4%) were the most common reasons for admission of cases. Lack of ANC [AOR = 3.25; 95%CI: 2.21,7.69], prior history of Cesarean section [AOR = 3.53; 95%CI:1.79,6.98], delaying more than 60 minute to access final place of care [AOR = 3.21; 95%CI:1.61,6.39], poor practice of Birth preparedness and complication readiness (BPCR) [AOR = 3.31; 95%CI:1.50,7.29], and history of preexisting medical disorders [AOR = 2.79; 95%CI:1.45,5.37] were identified as significantly determinants of maternal near miss.Stakeholders need to enhance their efforts for improving access to roads and transportations. Besides, women who have a prior history of Caesarean section, chronic medical conditions, and no ANC need special attention from their families and health care providers to proactively mitigate the occurrence of serious obstetric complications. More attention has to be paid to birth preparedness and complication readiness activities."
https://openalex.org/W3160779481,"RNA-seq is routinely used to measure gene expression changes in response to cell perturbation. Genes upregulated or downregulated following some perturbation are designated as genes of interest, and their most expressed isoform(s) would then be selected for follow-up experimentation. However, because of its need to fragment RNA molecules, RNA-seq is limited in its ability to capture gene isoforms and their expression patterns. This lack of isoform-specific data means that isoforms would be selected based on annotation databases that are incomplete, not tissue specific, or do not provide key information on expression levels. As a result, minority or nonexistent isoforms might be selected for follow-up, leading to loss in valuable resources and time. There is therefore a great need to comprehensively identify gene isoforms along with their corresponding levels of expression. Using the long-read nanopore-based R2C2 method, which does not fragment RNA molecules, we generated an Isoform-level transcriptome Atlas of Macrophage Activation that identifies full-length isoforms in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages. Macrophages are critical innate immune cells important for recognizing pathogens through binding of pathogen-associated molecular patterns to toll-like receptors, culminating in the initiation of host defense pathways. We characterized isoforms for most moderately-to-highly expressed genes in resting and toll-like receptor–activated monocyte-derived macrophages, identified isoforms differentially expressed between conditions, and validated these isoforms by RT-qPCR. We compiled these data into a user-friendly data portal within the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/vollmers/IAMA). Our atlas represents a valuable resource for innate immune research, providing unprecedented isoform information for primary human macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W3157560146,"Suicide is the 10 th leading cause of death in the U.S (1999-2019). However, predicting when someone will attempt suicide has been nearly impossible. In the modern world, many individuals suffering from mental illness seek emotional support and advice on well-known and easily-accessible social media platforms such as Reddit. While prior artificial intelligence research has demonstrated the ability to extract valuable information from social media on suicidal thoughts and behaviors, these efforts have not considered both severity and temporality of risk. The insights made possible by access to such data have enormous clinical potential—most dramatically envisioned as a trigger to employ timely and targeted interventions (i.e., voluntary and involuntary psychiatric hospitalization) to save lives. In this work, we address this knowledge gap by developing deep learning algorithms to assess suicide risk in terms of severity and temporality from Reddit data based on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). In particular, we employ two deep learning approaches: time-variant and time-invariant modeling, for user-level suicide risk assessment, and evaluate their performance against a clinician-adjudicated gold standard Reddit corpus annotated based on the C-SSRS. Our results suggest that the time-variant approach outperforms the time-invariant method in the assessment of suicide-related ideations and supportive behaviors (AUC:0.78), while the time-invariant model performed better in predicting suicide-related behaviors and suicide attempt (AUC:0.64). The proposed approach can be integrated with clinical diagnostic interviews for improving suicide risk assessments."
https://openalex.org/W3161181417,"Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) catalyzes posttranslational modification of many target proteins through converting protein arginine or mono-methylarginine to citrulline. Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation is the most dramatic manifestation of PAD4-mediated hypercitrullination reaction in neutrophils, which is characterized by the release of nuclear chromatin to form a chromatin network in the extracellular space. Histones H4, one of the major protein components of chromatin, is released into the extracellular space during sepsis, trauma, and ischemia-reperfusion injury and can also be released during the process of NET formation, along with its citrullinated form. The present study showed that histone H4 can induce NET formation in a calcium and PAD4 dependent manner. Histone H4 caused permeabilization of the neutrophil membrane and sustained rise in intracellular calcium that is necessary for activation of PAD4. In comparison, citrullinated histone H4 induced less calcium influx compared with its native form, leading to reduced NET formation. These studies suggest that citrullinated histone H4 could serve as a brake in the pathology of NETs, slowing down the vicious circle between histone H4 and NETs."
https://openalex.org/W3161889067,"In the highly eusocial wasp, Vespula vulgaris, queens produce honest signals to alert their subordinate workers of their fertility status, and therefore they are reproductively suppressed and help in the colony. The honesty of the queen signals is likely maintained due to hormonal regulation, which affects fertility and fertility cue expression. Here, we tested if hormonal pleiotropy could support the hypothesis that juvenile hormone controls fertility and fertility signaling in workers. In addition, we aimed to check oocyte size as a proxy of fertility. To do that, we treated V. vulgaris workers with synthetic versions of juvenile hormone (JH) analogue and a JH inhibitor, methoprene and precocene, respectively. We dissected the treated females to check ovary activation and analyzed their chemical profile. Our results showed that juvenile hormone has an influence on the abundance of fertility linked compounds produced by workers, and it also showed to increase oocyte size in workers. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that juvenile hormone controls fertility and fertility signaling in workers, whereby workers are unable to reproduce without alerting other colony members of their fertility. This provides supports the hypothesis that hormonal pleiotropy contributes to keeping the queen fertility signals honest."
https://openalex.org/W3160677506,"Serotonin is an important signaling molecule in the periphery and in the brain. The hydroxylation of tryptophan is the first and rate-limiting step of its synthesis. In most vertebrates, two enzymes have been described to catalyze this step, tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) 1 and 2, with expression localized to peripheral and neuronal cells, respectively. However, animals lacking both TPH isoforms still exhibit about 10% of normal serotonin levels in the blood demanding an additional source of the monoamine. In this study, we provide evidence by the gain and loss of function approaches in in vitro and in vivo systems, including stable-isotope tracing in mice, that phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) is a third TPH in mammals. PAH contributes to serotonin levels in the blood, and may be important as a local source of serotonin in organs in which no other TPHs are expressed, such as liver and kidney."
https://openalex.org/W3161117170,"Durum wheat is an important cereal grown in Ethiopia, a country which is also its center for genetic diversity. Yellow (stripe) rust caused by Puccinia striiformis fsp tritici is one of the most devastating diseases threatening Ethiopian wheat production. To identify sources of genetic resistance and combat this pathogen, we conducted a genome wide association study of yellow rust resistance on 300 durum wheat accessions comprising 261 landraces and 39 cultivars. The accessions were evaluated for their field resistance using a modified Cobb scale at Meraro, Kulumsa and Chefe Donsa in the 2015 and 2016 main growing seasons. Analysis of the 35K Axiom Array genotyping data of the panel resulted in a total of 8,797 polymorphic SNPs of which 7,093 were used in subsequent analyses. Population structure analysis suggested two groups in which the cultivars clearly stood out separately from the landraces. Eleven SNPs significantly associated with yellow rust resistance were identified on four chromosomes (1A, 1B, 2B, and 5A) which defined at least five genomic loci. Six of the SNPs were consistently identified on chromosome 1B singly at each and combined overall environments which explained 62.6–64.0% of the phenotypic variation (R 2 ). Resistant allele frequency ranged from 14.0–71.0%; Zooming in to the identified resistance loci revealed the presence of disease resistance related genes involved in the plant defense system such as the ABC transporter gene family, disease resistance protein RPM1 (NBS-LRR class), Receptor kinases and Protein kinases. This study has provided SNPs for tracking the loci associated with yellow rust resistance and a diversity panel which can be used for association study of other agriculturally important traits in durum wheat."
https://openalex.org/W3154057611,"In dynamic multisensory environments, the perceptual system corrects for discrepancies arising between modalities. For instance, in the ventriloquism aftereffect (VAE), spatial disparities introduced between visual and auditory stimuli lead to a perceptual recalibration of auditory space. Previous research has shown that the VAE is underpinned by multiple recalibration mechanisms tuned to different timescales, however it remains unclear whether these mechanisms use common or distinct spatial reference frames. Here we asked whether the VAE operates in eye- or head-centred reference frames across a range of adaptation timescales, from a few seconds to a few minutes. We developed a novel paradigm for selectively manipulating the contribution of eye- versus head-centred visual signals to the VAE by manipulating auditory locations relative to either the head orientation or the point of fixation. Consistent with previous research, we found both eye- and head-centred frames contributed to the VAE across all timescales. However, we found no evidence for an interaction between spatial reference frames and adaptation duration. Our results indicate that the VAE is underpinned by multiple spatial reference frames that are similarly leveraged by the underlying time-sensitive mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3160165524,"To assess potential changes in pupil size during femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) using a low-energy laser system.The pupil sizes of eyes undergoing FLACS were measured using the Ziemer LDV Z8 by extracting images from the laser software after each of the following steps: application of suction, lens fragmentation, and capsulotomy. Furthermore, the pupil diameters were measured based on preoperative surgical microscope images and after releasing the suction. Paired t-test and the two one-sided tests (TOST) procedure were used for statistical analyses. The horizontal and vertical pupil diameters were compared in each of the steps with preoperative values.Data were available for 52 eyes (52 patients, mean age 73.4 years, range 51-87 years). The equivalence between mean preoperative pupil size and status immediately after femtosecond laser treatment was confirmed (p<0.001; 95% confidence interval [-0.0637, 0.0287] for horizontal and p<0.001; 95% CI [-0.0158, 0.0859] for vertical diameter). There was statistically significant horizontal and vertical enlargement of pupil diameters between 0.15 and 0.24 mm during the laser treatment steps as compared with preoperative values (all p values <0.001).No progressive pupil narrowing was observed using low-energy FLACS. Although a suction-induced, slight increase in pupil area became apparent, this effect was completely reversible after removing the laser interface."
https://openalex.org/W3160712306,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common form of scoliosis. However, the underlying mechanisms linking spinal curvature in AIS to foot characteristics and walking performance remain unclear.This study aimed to compare walking performance between adolescents with mild, moderate, and severe scoliosis and matched healthy peers with foot posture as covariates.This cross-sectional study of 96 adolescents was conducted between April 2020 to October 2020 in China, with 32 healthy peers in the control group and 64 patients in the AIS group. Foot posture and morphology, plantar pressure distribution, and gait characteristics were analyzed. One-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction and a post hoc comparison of the mean differences between the different groups was performed. Multiple analyses of covariance adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, foot posture index (FPI), arch index (AI), and walking speed were performed.Of the 64 adolescents with scoliosis, 18 had mild AIS, 32 had moderate AIS, and 14 had severe AIS. The AI and FPI were much higher in the moderate and severe AIS groups (p = 0.018) and the severe AIS group (p<0.001), respectively, than in the control group. The severe AIS group had advanced and longer midstance (p = 0.014) and delayed propulsion phase (p = 0.013) than the control group. Patients with moderate and severe AIS had asymmetrical gait periods in the left and right limbs (p<0.05). Significant differences in the center-of-pressure excursion index (CPEI) were found between the moderate and severe AIS and control groups (p = 0.003).Moderate and severe AIS significantly influenced walking performance; however, no significant differences were observed between adolescents with mild AIS and healthy controls. Thus, early intervention could target the prevention of specific functional deficits and prevent it from progressing to a severe state."
https://openalex.org/W3161272368,"Background The present study describes motor skills in a large sample of German children and adolescents and investigates associations with age, gender, body-mass index, physical activity, television time, and socioeconomic status. Methods 2,106 children (1076 boys, 1030 girls) aged 4 to 17 years performed five different motor tests for strength (pushups, standing long jump), coordination (backward balancing, jumping side-to-side) and flexibility (forward bend) within the framework of the LIFE Child study (Leipzig, Germany). Anthropometric parameters were assessed through standardized measurement. Data on physical activity, television time, and socioeconomic status were collected via questionnaires. Linear regression analyses were applied to assess relations. Results Strength and coordination performance were higher in older than in younger children. While boys showed a higher performance in strengths tests than girls, girls performed better in flexibility and coordination during precision tasks (backward balancing). In terms of coordination under time constraint (jumping side-to-side), both genders produced similar results. Lower body-mass index, higher physical activity, and higher socioeconomic status were significantly related to better motor skills. Longer television times were significantly associated with lower performance in long jump. Conclusions The present findings are similar to data collected at the beginning of the century, indicating that motor skills have hardly changed in recent years. The findings furthermore suggest that children from lower social strata, children with higher body weight, and children who move little have a higher risk of developing insufficient motor skills and should therefore be given special support."
https://openalex.org/W3161850690,"Mesenchymal stem cells from healthy adipose tissue are adipocytes progenitors with immunosuppressive potential that are used for years in cell therapy. Whether adipose stem cells (ASC) may prevent inflammation in early obesity is not known. To address this question, we performed a kinetic study of high-fat (HF) diet induced obesity in mice to follow the immune regulating functions of adipose stem cells (ASC) isolated from the subcutaneous (SAT) and the visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Our results show that, early in obesity and before inflammation was detected, HF diet durably and differently activated ASC from SAT and VAT. Subcutaneous ASC from HF-fed mice strongly inhibited the proliferation of activated T lymphocytes, whereas visceral ASC selectively inhibited TNFα expression by macrophages and simultaneously released higher concentrations of IL6. These depot specific differences may contribute to the low-grade inflammation that develops with obesity in VAT while inflammation in SAT is delayed. The mechanisms involved differ from those already described for naïve cells activation with inflammatory cytokines and probably engaged metabolic activation. These results evidence that adipose stem cells are metabolic sensors acquiring an obesity-primed immunocompetent state in answer to depot-specific intrinsic features with overnutrition, placing these cells ahead of inflammation in the local dialog with immune cells."
https://openalex.org/W3162336649,"Due to an increasing number of cardiovascular diseases, artificial heart valves and blood vessels have been developed. Although cardiovascular applications using decellularized tissue have been studied, the mechanisms of their functionality remain unknown. To determine the important factors for preparing decellularized cardiovascular prostheses that show good in vivo performance, the effects of the luminal surface structure of the decellularized aorta on thrombus formation and cell behavior were investigated. Various luminal surface structures of a decellularized aorta were prepared by heating, drying, and peeling. The luminal surface structure and collagen denaturation were evaluated by immunohistological staining, collagen hybridizing peptide (CHP) staining, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. To evaluate the effects of luminal surface structure of decellularized aorta on thrombus formation and cell behavior, blood clotting tests and recellularization of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells were performed. The results of the blood clotting test showed that the closer the luminal surface structure is to the native aorta, the higher the anti-coagulant property. The results of the cell seeding test suggest that vascular cells recognize the luminal surface structure and regulate adhesion, proliferation, and functional expression accordingly. These results provide important factors for preparing decellularized cardiovascular prostheses and will lead to future developments in decellularized cardiovascular applications."

We hypothesized such patients would receive less cancer treatment and have worse outcomes.We analyzed administrative data from the province of Ontario including demographics, hospitalization records, physician billings, cancer diagnosis, and treatments. COPD was defined using the ICES-derived COPD cohort (1996-2014) with data from 2002 to 2014. Descriptive statistics and multivariable analyses were undertaken.Of 105 304 individuals with lung cancer, 43 375 (41%) had stage data and 36 738 (34.9%) had COPD. Those with COPD were likely to be younger, have a Charlson score ≤ 1, have lower income, to live rurally, and to have stage I/II lung cancer (29.8 vs 26.5%; all p<0.001). For the COPD population with stage I/II cancer, surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy were less likely (56.8 vs. 65.9% and 15.4 vs. 17.1%, respectively), while radiation was more likely (26.0 vs. 21.8%) (p all < 0.001). In the stage III/IV population, individuals with COPD received less chemotherapy (55.9 vs 64.4%) or radiation (42.5 vs 47.5%; all p<0.001). Inhaler and oxygen use was higher those with COPD, as were hospitalizations for respiratory infections and COPD exacerbations. On multivariable analysis, overall survival was worse among those with COPD (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.19-1.22).A co-diagnosis of COPD and lung cancer is associated with less curative treatment in early stage disease, less palliative treatment in late stage disease, and poorer outcomes."

Although initially developed for tricuspid aortic valves (TAV), transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) devices are increasingly applied to the treatment of BAV stenosis. It is known that patient-device relationship between TAVR and BAV are not equivalent to those observed in TAV but the nature of these differences are not well understood. We sought to better understand the patient-device relationships between TAVR devices and the two most common morphologies of BAV. We performed finite element simulation of TAVR deployment into three cases of idealized aortic anatomies (TAV, Sievers 0 BAV, Sievers 1 BAV), derived from patient-specific measurements. Valve leaflet von Mises stress at the aortic commissures differed by valve configuration over a ten-fold range (TAV: 0.55 MPa, Sievers 0: 6.64 MPa, and Sievers 1: 4.19 MPa). First principle stress on the aortic wall was greater in Sievers 1 (0.316 MPa) and Sievers 0 BAV (0.137 MPa) compared to TAV (0.056 MPa). TAVR placement in Sievers 1 BAV demonstrated significant device asymmetric alignment, with 1.09 mm of displacement between the center of the device measured at the annulus and at the leaflet free edge. This orifice displacement was marginal in TAV (0.33 mm) and even lower in Sievers 0 BAV (0.23 mm). BAV TAVR, depending on the subtype involved, may encounter disparate combinations of device under expansion and asymmetry compared to TAV deployment. Understanding the impacts of BAV morphology on patient-device relationships can help improve device selection, patient eligibility, and the overall safety of TAVR in BAV."
https://openalex.org/W3162364770,"Testosterone and alendronate have been identified as two bone healing compounds which, when combined, synergistically stimulate bone regeneration. This study describes the development of a novel ultrasonic spray coating for sustained release of ancillary amounts of testosterone and alendronate encapsulated in PLGA 5004A as a carrier. Due to the low amounts of testosterone and alendronate used, sensitive in vitro assays were developed to determine in vitro release. The ultrasonic spray coating technology was optimized for coating titanium screws and pericardial collagen membranes, with the aim to improve osseo-integration and (guided) bone regeneration, respectively, without interfering with their primary mode of action. In vitro release analysis of collagen membranes and screws showed up to 21 days sustained release of the compounds without a burst release. Subsequent preclinical studies in rat and rabbit models indicated that testosterone and alendronate coated membranes and screws significantly improved bone regeneration in vivo. Coated membranes significantly improved the formation of new bone in a critical size calvarial defect model in rats (by 160% compared to controls). Coated screws implanted in rabbit femoral condyles significantly improved bone implant contact (69% vs 54% in controls), bone mineral density (121%) and bone volume (119%) up to 1.3 mm from the implant. Based on the results obtained, we suggest that implants or membranes enabled with local sustained delivery of ancillary amounts of testosterone and alendronate can be a promising system to stimulate local bone regeneration resulting in improved osseo-integration of implants and improved healing of bone defects and fractures."
https://openalex.org/W3163028851,"The purpose of this longitudinal follow-up study was to investigate the risk of ischemic stroke nationwide in patients with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and controls who were matched in age and sex. Patient data were collected from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) Health Screening (HEALS) cohort. Using the International Classification of Diseases code M05 (seropositive RA), with a prescription of any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD), RA was identified. A total of 2,765 patients and 13,825 control subjects were included in our study. The 12-year incidence of ischemic stroke in each group was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The risk ratio of ischemic stroke was estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Sixty-four patients (2.31%) in the seropositive RA group and 512 (3.70%) in the control group experienced ischemic stroke (P < 0.001) during the follow-up period. The hazard ratio of ischemic stroke in the seropositive RA group was 1.32 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.73) after adjusting for age and sex. The adjusted hazard ratio of ischemic stroke in the seropositive RA group was 1.40 (95% CI, 1.07-1.82) after adjusting for demographics and comorbid medical disorders. According to the subgroup analysis, the hazard ratios of ischemic stroke risks in the female and hypertensive subgroups were 1.44 (95% CI, 1.05-1.97) and 1.66 (95% CI, 1.16-2.38), respectively. In the non-diabetes and non-dyslipidemia subgroups, the corresponding hazard ratios of ischemic stroke were 1.47 (95% CI, 1.11-1.95) and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.07-1.91). Seropositive RA patients have an increased risk of ischemic stroke. In female, hypertension, non-diabetes, and non-dyslipidemia RA subgroups, even without the traditional risk factors for stroke (except for hypertension), increased the risk, which could be potentially attributed to RA."
https://openalex.org/W3161671832,"The unique properties of carbon-based nanomaterials, including fullerenol, have attracted great interest in agricultural and environmental applications. Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient for major metabolic processes, for which a shortage causes chlorosis and reduces the yield of many crops cultivated worldwide. In the current study, the metabolic responses of Cucumis sativus (a Strategy I plant) to fullerenol treatments were investigated depending on the Fe status of plants. Cucumber plants were grown hydroponically, either with [+FeII (ferrous) and +FeIII (ferric)] or in Fe-free (-FeII and -FeIII) nutrient solution, with (+F) or without (-F) a fullerenol supply. Iron species-dependent effects were observed in either Fe-fed or Fe-starved plants, with alteration of metabolites involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, lipophilic compounds. Metabolic perturbations triggered by fullerenol in the FeIII-treated plants were in the opposite kind from those in the FeII-treated plants. Whereas in the FeIII-fed plants, fullerenol activated the metabolisation of carbohydrates and amino acids, in the FeII-fed plants, fullerenol activated the metabolisation of lipophilic compounds and repressed the metabolisation of carbohydrates and amino acids. In FeIII-deficient plants, fullerenol stimulated the metabolism of C3 carboxylates and lipophilic compounds while repressing the metabolism of amino acids, hexoses and dicarboxylates, while in FeII-deficient plants, activations of the metabolism of amino acids and dicarboxylates and repression of sterol metabolism by fullerenol were observed. The results indicated that the valence state of Fe sources is of importance for re-programming metabolome responses in cucumber to fullerenol either in Fe-sufficient or Fe-deficient conditions. These investigations are significant for understanding fullerenol interactions and risk assessment in plants with different Fe statuses."
https://openalex.org/W3162696798,"Since growing tumors stimulate angiogenesis, via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiogenesis inhibitors (AIs, blockers of the VEGF signaling pathway) have been introduced to cancer therapy. However, AIs often yielded only modest and short-lived gains in cancer patients and more invasive tumor phenotypes in animal models. Combining anti-VEGF strategies with lactate uptake blockers may boost both efficacy and safety of AIs. We assessed this hypothesis by using the ex ovo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. We show that AI-based monotherapy (Avastin®, AVA) increases tumor hypoxia in human CAM cancer cell xenografts and cell spread in human as well as canine CAM cancer cell xenografts. In contrast, combining AVA treatment with lactate importer MCT1 inhibitors (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHC) or AZD3965 (AZD)) reduced both tumor growth and cell dissemination of human and canine explants. Moreover, combining AVA+AZD diminished blood perfusion and tumor hypoxia in human explants. Thus, the ex ovo CAM assay as an easy, fast and cheap experimental setup is useful for pre-clinical cancer research. Moreover, as an animal-free experimental setup the CAM assay can reduce the high number of laboratory animals used in pre-clinical cancer research."
https://openalex.org/W3160432936,"Experimental cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury causes degradation of the glycocalyx and coronary washout of its components syndecan-1 and heparan sulfate. Systemic elevation of syndecan-1 and heparan sulfate is well described in cardiac surgery. Still, the events during immediate reperfusion after aortic declamping are unknown both in the systemic and in the coronary circulation.In thirty patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, arterial concentrations of syndecan-1 and heparan sulfate were measured immediately before and at one, five and ten minutes after aortic declamping (reperfusion). Parallel blood samples were drawn from the coronary sinus to calculate trans-coronary gradients (coronary sinus-artery).Compared with immediately before aortic declamping, arterial syndecan-1 increased by 18% [253.8 (151.6-372.0) ng/ml vs. 299.1 (172.0-713.7) ng/ml, p < 0.001] but arterial heparan sulfate decreased by 14% [148.1 (135.7-161.7) ng/ml vs. 128.0 (119.0-138.2) ng/ml, p < 0.001] at one minute after aortic declamping. There was no coronary washout of syndecan-1 or heparan sulfate during reperfusion. On the contrary, trans-coronary sequestration of syndecan-1 occurred at five [-12.96 ng/ml (-36.38-5.15), p = 0.007] and at ten minutes [-12.37 ng/ml (-31.80-6.62), p = 0.049] after reperfusion.Aortic declamping resulted in extracardiac syndecan-1 release and extracardiac heparan sulfate sequestration. Syndecan-1 was sequestered in the coronary circulation during early reperfusion. Glycocalyx has been shown to degrade during cardiac surgery. Besides degradation, glycocalyx has propensity for regeneration. The present results of syndecan-1 and heparan sulfate sequestration may reflect endogenous restoration of the damaged glycocalyx in open heart surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3160944852,"We investigate the feasibility of molecular-level sample classification of sepsis using microarray gene expression data merged by in silico meta-analysis. Publicly available data series were extracted from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus and EMBL-EBI ArrayExpress to create a comprehensive meta-analysis microarray expression set (meta-expression set). Measurements had to be obtained via microarray-technique from whole blood samples of adult or pediatric patients with sepsis diagnosed based on international consensus definition immediately after admission to the intensive care unit. We aggregate trauma patients, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) patients, and healthy controls in a non-septic entity. Differential expression (DE) analysis is compared with machine-learning-based solutions like decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and deep-learning neural networks (DNNs). We evaluated classifier training and discrimination performance in 100 independent iterations. To test diagnostic resilience, we gradually degraded expression data in multiple levels. Clustering of expression values based on DE genes results in partial identification of sepsis samples. In contrast, RF, SVM, and DNN provide excellent diagnostic performance measured in terms of accuracy and area under the curve (>0.96 and >0.99, respectively). We prove DNNs as the most resilient methodology, virtually unaffected by targeted removal of DE genes. By surpassing most other published solutions, the presented approach substantially augments current diagnostic capability in intensive care medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3162441532,"The long-term ecological success of compensatory freshwater wetland projects has come into question based on follow-up monitoring studies over the past few decades. Given that wetland restoration may require many years to decades to converge to desired outcomes, long-term monitoring of successional patterns may increase our ability to fully evaluate success of wetland mitigation projects or guide adaptive management when needed. In Portsmouth, New Hampshire a 4 ha wetland was constructed in an abandoned gravel quarry as off-site compensatory mitigation for impacts to a scrub-shrub swamp associated with property expansion. Building upon prior evaluations from 1992 and 2002, we conducted a floral survey in 2020 to compare results with prior surveys to document vegetation successional trends over time. In addition, we monitored the avian community throughout the growing season as a measure of habitat quality. The plant community mirrored documented successional trends of freshwater wetland restoration projects as native hydrophytes dominated species composition. Plant species composition stabilized as the rate of turnover, the measurement of succession, declined by nearly half after 17 years. Researchers should consider long-term monitoring of specific sites to better understand successional patterns of created wetlands as we documented long time frames required for the development of scrub-shrub swamps, red maple swamps, and sedge meadows. High species richness was attributed to beaver activity, topographic heterogeneity from Carex stricta tussocks, and the seed bank from the application of peat from the original wetland. Habitat heterogeneity of open water, herbaceous cover, and woody vegetation supports a diverse avian community including 11 wetland dependent species. Although the mitigation project has not created the full area of lost scrub-shrub swamp after 35 years, it has developed a structurally complex habitat and diverse avian community that effectively provides the functions and values of the impacted system."
https://openalex.org/W3163329879,"The unfolded protein response plays an evolutionarily conserved role in homeostasis, and its dysregulation often leads to human disease, including diabetes and cancer. IRE1α is a major transducer that conveys endoplasmic reticulum stress via biochemical signals, yet major gaps persist in our understanding of how the detection of stress is converted to one of several molecular outcomes. It is known that, upon sensing unfolded proteins via its endoplasmic reticulum luminal domain, IRE1α dimerizes and then oligomerizes (often visualized as clustering). Once assembled, the kinase domain trans-autophosphorylates a neighboring IRE1α, inducing a conformational change that activates the RNase effector domain. However, the full details of how the signal is transmitted are not known. Here, we describe a previously unrecognized role for helix αK, located between the kinase and RNase domains of IRE1α, in conveying this critical conformational change. Using constructs containing mutations within this interdomain helix, we show that distinct substitutions affect oligomerization, kinase activity, and the RNase activity of IRE1α differentially. Furthermore, using both biochemical and computational methods, we found that different residues at position 827 specify distinct conformations at distal sites of the protein, such as in the RNase domain. Of importance, an RNase-inactive mutant, L827P, can still dimerize with wildtype monomers, but this mutation inactivates the wildtype molecule and renders leukemic cells more susceptible to stress. We surmise that helix αK is a conduit for the activation of IRE1α in response to stress.

We surmise that helix αK is a conduit for the activation of IRE1α in response to stress. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is highly specialized for the folding and quality control of secreted, plasma membrane, and organelle proteins. Accumulation of proteins in the ER initiates a cellular response called unfolded protein response, a signal transduction and transcriptional program that increases the folding capacity of the cell in an attempt to alleviate the stress. If the stress is not resolved, the cell is committed to apoptosis (1Han D. Lerner A.G. Vande Walle L. Upton J.P. Xu W. Hagen A. Backes B.J. Oakes S.A. Papa F.R.

ER stress can be induced chemically (e.g., by inhibiting the ER calcium pump with thapsigargin, by inhibiting glycosylation with tunicamycin [Tm], or by blocking disulfide bond formation with dithiothreitol) or can be induced by different physiological processes. Professional secretory cells, such as pancreatic β cells and plasma cells, which produce high levels of proteins, are particularly prone to physiological ER stress (2Molinari M. Sitia R.

In mammalian cells, ER stress is detected by three different ER transmembrane sensors: inositol-requiring enzyme 1 α (IRE1α), protein kinase RNA–like ER kinase, and activating transcription factor-6. The IRE1α arm is the most conserved one and has been extensively studied. Two mechanisms have been proposed for its activation by ER stress: direct binding to misfolded proteins (7Gardner B.M.

Biol. 2013; 5: a013169Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) or the dissociation of the ER luminal chaperone, the binding protein (BiP/GRP78), which keeps IRE1α inactive (8Walter P. Ron D.

IRE1α then dimerizes through its luminal domain (11Liu C.Y. Xu Z. Kaufman R.J. Structure and intermolecular interactions of the luminal dimerization domain of human IRE1alpha.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17680-17687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and undergoes autotransphosphorylation via its cytoplasmic kinase domain (12Shamu C.E. Walter P. Oligomerization and phosphorylation of the Ire1p kinase during intracellular signaling from the endoplasmic reticulum to the nucleus.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3028-3039Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). This in turn triggers a conformational change that activates the RNase domains of IRE1α (13Korennykh A.V. Egea P.F. Korostelev A.A. Finer-Moore J. Stroud R.M. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Walter P. Cofactor-mediated conformational control in the bifunctional kinase/RNase Ire1.BMC Biol. 2011; 9: 48Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The enzymatically active IRE1α either cleaves XBP1 mRNA at two sites, to create the reading frame for the active XBP1 transcription factor, or cleaves a select group of transcripts once each, initiating regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD) of these transcripts (14Hollien J. Weissman J.S. Decay of endoplasmic reticulum-localized mRNAs during the unfolded protein response.Science. 2006; 313: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). The sequence of events that activates IRE1α was defined by showing that mutations in the luminal domain, in the cytosolic kinase domain or in the cytosolic RNase domain can render IRE1α inactive and abrogate the downstream signaling. How the three domains of the molecule form a modular activation relay is not yet understood. Deciphering this mechanism is important because IRE1α can be activated not only by luminal ER stress but also by membrane perturbations that do not require the luminal domain (15Volmer R. van der Ploeg K. Ron D. Membrane lipid saturation activates endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response transducers through their transmembrane domains.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 110: 4628-4633Crossref Scopus (338) Google Scholar), as well as by a bypass mode in response to binding of flavonoids to the cytosolic dimer interface of the RNase domains (16Wiseman R.L.

The critical event during mammalian IRE1α activation was long thought to be the phosphoryl transfer reaction (17Ali M.M. Bagratuni T. Davenport E.L. Nowak P.R. Silva-Santisteban M.C. Hardcastle A. McAndrews C. Rowlands M.G. Morgan G.J. Aherne W. Collins I. Davies F.E. Pearl L.H. Structure of the Ire1 autophosphorylation complex and implications for the unfolded protein response.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 894-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Counterintuitively, however, some kinase-inactive IRE1α mutants can support RNase activity if provided with appropriate nucleotide mimetics that bind in the kinase pocket, but are not hydrolyzed (18Papa F.R.

This indicates that the key event is not the phosphoryl transfer per se but the conformational change that ensues. The nature of this conformational change, however, is currently not defined. Yeast IRE1α had been crystalized in two states: an RNase-inactive conformation with the kinase sites of the two monomers oriented “face to face” and an RNase “active” back-to-back conformation (17Ali M.M.

Ire1 has distinct catalytic mechanisms for XBP1/HAC1 splicing and RIDD.Cell Rep. 2014; 9: 850-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Whether a similar rotation of the entire luminal portion of mammalian IRE1α is the relevant conformational change that governs its activation or whether there are other changes that convey the active state of the kinase domain to the RNase domain is currently unknown. Therefore, it is important to define the intramolecular changes within IRE1α that occur after the kinase activation and initiate RNase activity. Toward this end, we characterized mutations in helix αK, connecting the kinase and RNase domains, which unexpectedly affected the enzymatic activities of IRE1α despite being far removed from either of the two active sites. We show here that some substitutions in helix αK, specifically of residue L827, render IRE1α enzymatically inactive, without inhibiting other activities such as dimerization and also inhibits a wildtype version of IRE1α. Of importance, mutations in helix αK have long-range effects on the conformation of IRE1α when it is activated by ER stress, suggesting that the interface between the kinase and RNase domain of IRE1α might tune distinct outcomes of IRE1α activities. A derivative of HAP1, a near-haploid human cell line, termed HAP1KO, was engineered by CRISPR-Cas9 editing, to abolish the expression of IRE1α. HAP1 and HAP1KO cells were maintained in IMDM medium (Invitrogen) (see (23Ricci D. Marrocco I. Dibos M. Blumenthal D. Eletto D. Vargas J. Boyle S. Iwamoto S C. Paton J. Paton A. Argon Y.

HAP1, HAP1KO, and Kms11 cells were transduced with a Tet-On lentivirus and with a pTIGHT-IRE1-GFP-HA (IRE1GFP) lentivirus and selected for antibiotic resistance as in (23Ricci D. Marrocco I. Dibos M.

Where indicated, IRE1GFP WT and mutants with only GFP or HA tag were also used. IRE1GFP expression was induced with 1 μg/ml doxycycline (dox) (Biochemika) overnight. Tunicamycin and 4μ8c were from Calbiochem, thapsigargin was from MP Biomedicals, and Luteolin was from Sigma. GFP-Trap A beads were from Chromotek, and trypsin was from Promega.

Rosetta (release 3.11) was used to predict the changes in protein stability due to the point mutations. The input was the crystal structure of apo human IRE1α (Protein Data Bank [PDB]: 5HGI). It was preminimized using the “minimize_with_cst” application in Rosetta. We followed a ΔΔG _monomer application described by Kellogg et al. (26Kellogg E.H. Leaver-Fay A. Baker D. Role of conformational sampling in computing mutation-induced changes in protein structure and stability.Proteins. 2011; 79: 830-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) for estimating stability changes in monomeric proteins in response to point mutations. In brief, this application uses the input structure of the WT protein to generate a structural model of the point mutant. The ΔΔG is given by the difference in Rosetta energy unit between the WT structure and the point mutant structure. For more precise calculation, 50 models for each WT and mutant structures were generated, and the most accurate ΔΔG was calculated as the difference between the mean of the top three scoring WT structures and the top three scoring point-mutant structures.

Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% NP-40, 20 mM iodoacetamide, 1X protease inhibitors [Roche]). Five percent of the volume of the lysate was saved as “input” in sample buffer, and the rest was diluted in TNNB buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 0.1% BSA, 0.02% NaN3). GFP-Trap_A beads were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, beads were resuspended in sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% NP-40, 20 mM iodoacetamide, 1X protease inhibitors [Roche]). The protein content was determined by BCA assay (Pierce), and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked, probed with primary and secondary antibodies, and scanned on an Odyssey Infrared imager (Li-Cor). Primary antibodies used: anti-IRE1α (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-HA (Covance); anti-14.3.3 (Santa Cruz); anti-phospho-IRE1α Ser724 (Novus Biologicals); anti-phospho-IRE1α Ser729 (Dr Hu, Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA). IRDye-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Li-Cor. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% NP-40, 20 mM iodoacetamide), the protein content was determined as above, and trypsin was added at the indicated final concentration and incubated on ice for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding sample buffer and boiling the samples for 5 min. Western blot was then performed as above. HAP1 cells were plated on 35-mm microscopy-grade plastic dishes (Ibidi). After dox induction and subsequent imposition of chemical ER stress, the cells were imaged over 8 h using a Marianas fluorescence microscope equipped with an OKO Lab CO2 enclosure on a Zeiss inverted platform, with a 63X Plan-Apochromat 1.4 NA objective. Images were collected as in (23Ricci D. Marrocco I. Dibos M. Blumenthal D. Eletto D. Vargas J. Boyle S. Iwamoto S C. Paton J. Paton A. Argon Y.

Exposure times varied between 0.1 and 0.5 s, depending on sample intensity, unless otherwise specified. In some experiments, cells were imaged using a 63X Plan Apo 1.4 NA objective on an Axiovert 200M (Zeiss) with a spinning disc confocal system (UltraVIEW ERS6, PerkinElmer). Images were collected using an ORCA Flash 4.0 camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) using Volocity V.6.3.1 acquisition software. HAP1 or HAP1 L827P IRE1GFP cells were plated in six-well plates (Corning) at 5000 cells per well. IRE1GFP expression was induced with dox, and medium was changed every 2 days with fresh dox. Cells were stressed with various concentrations of Tm for the indicated times. The drug was then washed out, and the plates were incubated for 6 days at 37 °C and were then stained with 0.2% (w/v) crystal violet (Sigma) in 2% ethanol for 1 h at room temperature. The crystals were then dissolved in 2% SDS (1 h), and the color was quantified at OD570. To enumerate cells containing clusters, >200 cells were counted per condition in two or more independent experiments. Images were analyzed and quantified using a homemade cluster analyzer for ImageJ (23Ricci D. Marrocco I. Dibos M. Blumenthal D. Eletto D. Vargas J. Boyle S. Iwamoto S C. Paton J. Paton A. Argon Y. Clustering of IRE1α depends on sensing ER stress but not on its RNase activity.FASEB J. 2019; 33: 9811-9827Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Statistically significant differences between normally distributed populations were evaluated by Student's t test and by nonparametric tests, when the distributions were nonnormal. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on PDB files of mammalian IRE1α using the GROMACS 2018.8 software, with the AMBER14SB force field. The initial monomeric model was based on the crystal structure of human kinase and RNase domains in complex with ADP (PDB: 3P23, chain A). The User Template Mode of Swiss-Model web was employed to rebuild the missing structures in the model. After the removal of ADP and Mg2+ in the rebuilt monomeric structure, UCSF Chimera was used to align the rebuilt monomer structure to chains A and B in original 3p23.pdb and to build the complete face-to-face IRE1α dimer. MD simulations followed previously described methods (27Jordan E.J. Patil K. Suresh K. Park J.H. Mosse Y.P. Lemmo M.A. Radhakrishnan R. Computational algorithms for in silico profiling of activating mutations in cancer.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2019; 76: 2663-2679Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The 3p23 dimer was solvated in a cubic periodic box with TIP3P waters, and Na+ and Cl− were added to 0.1 M to neutralize the system. The energy minimization step was applied to the system until maximum force was less than 1000 kJ/mol/nm. Then, 100 ps Number of particles, volume, and temperature equilibration and 100 ps normal pressure and temperature equilibration were used to equilibrate the system. A 400-ns simulation was performed under normal pressure and temperature condition, using the sd integrator with 2-fs time step. The simulation temperature was set to 300 K for all simulations. The dimers of the L827P and L827F mutants were built using the Structure Editing function in UCSF Chimera. Each simulation of WT, L827P, and L827F was done in duplicate. To address how the activation signal is transmitted from the kinase domain of IRE1α to its RNase domain, we focused on a mutation that was discovered in a random mutant screen, L827P, that drastically inactivated this stress sensor despite being far removed from either the kinase or the RNase active sites. L827P is located in the vicinity of another previously reported mutation, P830L, which also renders IRE1α inactive (28Xue Z. He Y. Ye K. Gu Z. Mao Y. Qi L. A conserved structural determinant located at the interdomain region of mammalian inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 30859-30866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The location of both mutations in between the two functional domains suggested that this area might be important for IRE1α activity and perhaps for transmitting a signal from the kinase to the RNase domains. In order to study the mutant's effect on IRE1α activity, we used a clone of HAP1 cells deficient for IRE1α (HAP1KO) as a host for functional complementation of IRE1α and analysis of structure–function relationships (23Ricci D. Marrocco I. Dibos M. Blumenthal D. Eletto D. Vargas J. Boyle S. Iwamoto S C. Paton J. Paton A. Argon Y. Clustering of IRE1α depends on sensing ER stress but not on its RNase activity.FASEB J. 2019; 33: 9811-9827Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). HAP1KO cells only activate the XBP1 transcription factor when transduced with active IRE1α (23Ricci D. Marrocco I. Dibos M. Blumenthal D. Eletto D. Vargas J. Boyle S. Iwamoto S C. Paton J. Paton A. Argon Y. Clustering of IRE1α depends on sensing ER stress but not on its RNase activity.FASEB J. 2019; 33: 9811-9827Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), such as Dox-inducible GFP- and HA-tagged IRE1α (Fig. 1, A and B and (23Ricci D. Marrocco I. Dibos M. Blumenthal D. Eletto D. Vargas J. Boyle S. Iwamoto S C. Paton J. Paton A. Argon Y. Clustering of IRE1α depends on sensing ER stress but not on its RNase activity.FASEB J. 2019; 33: 9811-9827Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). Expression of IRE1α L827P failed to support XBP1 splicing in HAP1KO cells (Fig. 1B). When P827 was mutated back to the wildtype (WT) Leu, stress-dependent splicing activity was restored (Fig. 1B, denoted P827L), showing that the inactivation of IRE1α was due to the L827P substitution. In addition to its inability to support XBP1 splicing, L827P also failed to perform the RIDD activity of IRE1α, as measured by the transcript levels of the known target BLOC1S1 (Fig. 1C). Thus, the mutant IRE1α L827P is unable to perform either of the RNase activities. Furthermore, IRE1α L827P failed to cluster in response to ER stress, even at late time points (Fig. 1, D and E). All the activities that are defective in the L827P mutant should depend on the autophosphorylation activity of IRE1α (23Ricci D. Marrocco I. Dibos M. Blumenthal D. Eletto D. Vargas J. Boyle S. Iwamoto S C. Paton J. Paton A. Argon Y.

Cell Biol. 2018; 217: 1739-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the phosphorylation status of L827P IRE1α using an antibody that detects phospho-Ser729 (30Tang C.H. Chang S. Paton A.W. Paton J.C. Gabrilovich D.I. Ploegh H.L. Del Valle J.R. Hu C.C. Phosphorylation of IRE1 at S729 regulates RIDD in B cells and antibody production after immunization.J. Cell Biol. 2018; 217: 1739-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with Tm induced phosphorylation of WT IRE1α, and an even more robust phosphorylation was evident upon ablation of BiP with the toxin SubAB, a treatment known to provide higher level of ER stress (Fig. 1F; (31Paton A.W. Beddoe T. Thorpe C.M. Whisstock J.C. Wilce M.C. Rossjohn J. Talbot U.M. Paton J.C. AB5 subtilase cytotoxin inactivates the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP.Nature. 2006; 443: 548-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar)). In contrast, no significant phospho-Ser729 was detected for L827P IRE1α even at a high concentration of SubAB (Fig. 1F). Because of the specificity of the antibody, it is possible that L827P IRE1α is phosphorylated elsewhere but not on Ser729. Therefore, we subjected ER-stressed cell lysates to lambda phosphatase and resolved them by electrophoresis to visualize the migration shifts. This gel shift assay, in which proteins (treated or not with lambda phosphatase) are resolved on a long gel, is comparable with Phos-Tag gels in dissecting IRE1α phosphorylation. As shown in Figure S1A, WT IRE1α resolves into two species, with the higher-molecular-weight one being phosphorylated. Tm-treated or SubAB-treated IRE1α L827P exhibited no significant mobility shifts compared with unstressed IRE1α, indicating that the L827P protein is indeed not phosphorylated upon ER stress. The P830L mutation was previously shown to render IRE1α less stable, and that was proposed as a possible explanation for its drastic phenotype (28Xue Z. He Y. Ye K. Gu Z. Mao Y. Qi L. A conserved structural determinant located at the interdomain region of mammalian inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 30859-30866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, L827P showed a similar half-life to WT IRE1α (Fig. S1B), suggesting that unlike P830L, L827 affects the activity of IRE1α but not its stability. We conclude that L827P specifies a form of IRE1α that lacks most of the activities of the protein, even though the mutation is spatially distant from the IRE1α catalytically active sites (Fig. 1G). Since the L827P mutant is enzymatically inactive, we next tested whether L827P could interact and influence the activity of WT IRE1α. We expressed dox-inducible L827P IRE1GFP in the parental HAP1 cell line that had intact endogenous IRE1α. Prior to induction of the mutant protein with dox, these cells exhibited canonical XBP1 splicing activity when treated with Tm (Fig. 2A). However, when L827P IRE1GFP expression was induced, the XBP1 splicing activity of the WT allele was progressively inhibited in proportion to the level of induction of L827P IRE1GFP (Fig. 2, A and D). To test if this inhibitory effect was cell-type specific, we expressed WT or L827P IRE1GFP in multiple myeloma Kms11 cells that express intact endogenous IRE1α, do not have high basal activation of IRE1α"
https://openalex.org/W3163523816,"Axonemal I1 dynein (dynein f) is the largest inner dynein arm in cilia and a key regulator of ciliary beating. It consists of two dynein heavy chains, and an intermediate chain/light chain (ICLC) complex. However, the structural organization of the nine ICLC subunits remains largely unknown. Here, we used biochemical and genetic approaches, and cryo-electron tomography imaging in Chlamydomonas to dissect the molecular architecture of the I1 dynein ICLC complex. Using a strain expressing SNAP-tagged IC140, tomography revealed the location of the IC140 N-terminus at the proximal apex of the ICLC structure. Mass spectrometry of a tctex2b mutant showed that TCTEX2B dynein light chain is required for the stable assembly of TCTEX1 and inner dynein arm interacting proteins IC97 and FAP120. The structural defects observed in tctex2b located these 4 subunits in the center and bottom regions of the ICLC structure, which overlaps with the location of the IC138 regulatory subcomplex, which contains IC138, IC97, FAP120, and LC7b. These results reveal the three-dimensional organization of the native ICLC complex and indicate potential protein-protein interactions that are involved in the pathway by which I1 regulates ciliary motility."
https://openalex.org/W3163869368,"Theileria parva (T. parva) is a protozoan parasite that causes East Coast fever (ECF). The disease is endemic in Burundi and is a major constraint to livestock development. In this study, the parasite prevalence in cattle in six regions namely; Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western, Central and North Eastern was estimated. Furthermore, the sequence diversity of p67, Tp1 and Tp2 genes was assessed coupled with the population genetic structure of T. parva using five satellite markers. The prevalence of ECF was 30% (332/1109) on microscopy, 60% (860/1431) on ELISA and 79% (158/200) on p104 gene PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of p67 gene revealed that only allele 1 was present in the field samples. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of Tp1 and Tp2 showed that the majority of samples clustered with Muguga, Kiambu and Serengeti and shared similar epitopes. On the other hand, genetic analysis revealed that field samples shared only two alleles with Muguga Cocktail. The populations from the different regions indicated low genetic differentiation (FST = 0.047) coupled with linkage disequilibrium and non-panmixia. A low to moderate genetic differentiation (FST = 0.065) was also observed between samples and Muguga cocktail. In conclusion, the data presented revealed the presence of a parasite population that shared similar epitopes with Muguga Cocktail and was moderately genetically differentiated from it. Thus, use of Muguga Cocktail vaccine in Burundi is likely to confer protection against T. parva in field challenge trials."
https://openalex.org/W3161347259,"Soccer players frequently perform change-of-directions (CODs) at various speeds during matches. However, tracking systems have shown limitations to measure these efforts. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to propose a new approach to measure CODs using a local positioning system (LPS), and clarify position-related difference in profile of CODs by using the approach.The x- and y-coordinate data for each soccer player were measured with a local positioning system. Speed, acceleration, jerk, and direction of speed were derived from the coordinate data. Based on accelerations of above 2 m/s2, the onsets and ends of CODs derived from jerk were identified (COD duration). Changes of direction of speed (θCOD) were determined for the corresponding period. Six collegiate male soccer players performed CODs according to 13 set angles (0-180°; every 15°) so that differences between θCOD and set angle could be determined (Exp. 1). Relative frequency distributions of θCOD and number of CODs were determined in 79 collegiate and amateur male soccer players during 9 soccer matches (Exp. 2).In Exp. 1, θCOD was positively related to set angle (r = 0.99). Each θCOD was smaller than the corresponding set angle, and the difference became greater with increasing COD angle. In Exp. 2, The number of CODs in a match was 183 ± 39 across all positions. There were no significant position-related differences in the number of CODs. The duration of a COD was 0.89 ± 0.49 s across all positions. The relative frequency distribution of θCOD revealed that the number of CODs at 0-15° and 105-135° tended to be higher than those at other angles during soccer matches. Further, θCOD was affected by the speed at the onset of COD during soccer matches (Exp. 2).The current findings demonstrate that θCOD derived from direction of speed and jerk may be a new indicator for evaluating COD during soccer matches."
https://openalex.org/W3162681070,"Active DNA-dependent ATPase A Domain inhibitor (ADAADi) is the only known inhibitor of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins that targets the ATPase domain of these proteins. The molecule is synthesized by aminoglycoside phosphotransferase enzyme in the presence of aminoglycosides. ADAADi interacts with ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling proteins through motif Ia present in the conserved helicase domain, and thus, can potentially inhibit all members of this family of proteins. We show that mammalian cells are sensitive to ADAADi but with variable responses in different cell lines. ADAADi can be generated from a wide variety of aminoglycosides; however, cells showed differential response to ADAADi generated from various aminoglycosides. Using HeLa and DU145 cells as model system we have explored the effect of ADAADi on cellular functions. We show that the transcriptional network of a cell type is altered when treated with sub-lethal concentration of ADAADi. Although ADAADi has no known effects on DNA chemical and structural integrity, expression of DNA-damage response genes was altered. The transcripts encoding for the pro-apoptotic proteins were found to be upregulated while the anti-apoptotic genes were found to be downregulated. This was accompanied by increased apoptosis leading us to hypothesize that the ADAADi treatment promotes apoptotic-type of cell death by upregulating the transcription of pro-apoptotic genes. ADAADi also inhibited migration of cells as well as their colony forming ability leading us to conclude that the compound has effective anti-tumor properties."
https://openalex.org/W3162980363,"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. In Ecuador, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded on 29 February 2020. Despite efforts to control its spread, SARS-CoV-2 overran the Ecuadorian public health system, which became one of the most affected in Latin America on 24 April 2020. The Hospital General del Sur de Quito (HGSQ) had to transition from a general to a specific COVID-19 health center in a short period of time to fulfill the health demand from patients with respiratory afflictions. Here, we summarized the implementations applied in the HGSQ to become a COVID-19 exclusive hospital, including the rearrangement of hospital rooms and a triage strategy based on a severity score calculated through an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted chest computed tomography (CT). Moreover, we present clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory data from 75 laboratory tested COVID-19 patients, which represent the first outbreak of Quito city. The majority of patients were male with a median age of 50 years. We found differences in laboratory parameters between intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU cases considering C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and lymphocytes. Sensitivity and specificity of the AI-assisted chest CT were 21.4% and 66.7%, respectively, when considering a score >70%; regardless, this system became a cornerstone of hospital triage due to the lack of RT-PCR testing and timely results. If health workers act as vectors of SARS-CoV-2 at their domiciles, they can seed outbreaks that might put 1,879,047 people at risk of infection within 15 km around the hospital. Despite our limited sample size, the information presented can be used as a local example that might aid future responses in low and middle-income countries facing respiratory transmitted epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W3163625346,"Ultra-low temperature (ULT) storage of microbial biomass is routinely practiced in biological laboratories. However, there is very little insight regarding the effects of biomass storage at ULT and the structure of the cell envelope, on cell viability. Eventually, these aspects influence bacterial cell lysis which is one of the critical steps for biomolecular extraction, especially protein extraction. Therefore, we studied the effects of ULT-storage (-80°C) on three different bacterial platforms: Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis and the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. By using a propidium iodide assay and a modified MTT assay we determined the impact of ULT storage on cellular viability. Subsequently, the protein extraction efficiency was determined by analyzing the amount of protein released following the storage. The results successfully established that longer the ULT-storage time lower is the cell viability and larger is the protein extraction efficiency. Interestingly, E. coli and B. subtilis exhibited significant reduction in cell viability over Synechocystis 6803. This indicates that the cell membrane structure and composition may play a major role on cell viability in ULT storage. Interestingly, E. coli exhibited concomitant increase in cell lysis efficiency resulting in a 4.5-fold increase (from 109 μg/ml of protein on day 0 to 464 μg/ml of protein on day 2) in the extracted protein titer following ULT storage. Furthermore, our investigations confirmed that the protein function, tested through the extraction of fluorescent proteins from cells stored at ULT, remained unaltered. These results established the plausibility of using ULT storage to improve protein extraction efficiency. Towards this, the impact of shorter ULT storage time was investigated to make the strategy more time efficient to be adopted into protocols. Interestingly, E. coli transformants expressing mCherry yielded 2.7-fold increase (93 μg/mL to 254 μg/mL) after 10 mins, while 4-fold increase (380 μg/mL) after 120 mins of ULT storage in the extracted soluble protein. We thereby substantiate that: (1) the storage time of bacterial cells in -80°C affect cell viability and can alter protein extraction efficiency; and (2) exercising a simple ULT-storage prior to bacterial cell lysis can improve the desired protein yield without impacting its function."
https://openalex.org/W3163754658,"The progressive aging of the population represents a challenge for society. In particular, a strong increase in the number of people over 90 is expected in the next two decades. As this phenomenon will lead to an increase in illness and age-related dependency, the study of long-lived people represents an opportunity to explore which lifestyle factors are associated with healthy aging and which with the emergence of age-related diseases, especially Alzheimer's type dementia. The project ""Factors associated with healthy and pathologically aging in a sample of elderly people over 90 in the city of Madrid"" (MADRID+90) brings together a multidisciplinary research team in neurodegenerative diseases that includes experts in epidemiology, neurology, neuropsychology, neuroimaging and computational neuroscience. In the first phase of the project, a stratified random sampling was carried out according to the census of the city of Madrid followed by a survey conducted on 191 people aged 90 and over. This survey gathered information on demographics, clinical data, lifestyles and cognitive status. Here, the main results of that survey are showed. The second phase of the project aims to characterize individual trajectories in the course of either healthy and pathological aging, from a group of 50 subjects over 90 who will undergo a comprehensive clinical examination comprised of neurological and cognitive testing, MRI and EEG. The ultimate goal of the project is to characterize the biophysical and clinical profiles of a population that tends to receive little attention in the literature. A better understanding of the rapidly increasing group of nonagenarians will also help to design new policies that minimize the impact and future social and economic consequences of rapidly aging societies."

Gastrointestinal symptoms questionnaires and venous blood samples were collected before ingestion, immediately post-ingestion, and every 30 min for 480 min post-ingestion. Blood samples were analysed for blood pH, [HCO3-], [Na+], [Cl-] and plasma [citrate]. Linear mixed models were used to estimate the effect of the ingestion protocols.For all treatments, blood [HCO3-] was significantly elevated above baseline for the entire 480 min post-ingestion period, and peak occurred 180 min post-ingestion. Blood [HCO3-] and pH were significantly elevated above baseline and not significantly below the peak between 150-270 min post-ingestion. Furthermore, blood pH and [HCO3-] were significantly lower for the 60 min ingestion period when compared to the other treatments. Gastrointestinal symptoms were minor for all treatments; the mean total session symptoms ratings (all times summed together) were between 9.8 and 11.6 from a maximum possible rating of 720.Based on the findings of this investigation, sodium citrate should be ingested over a period of less than 60 min (15, 30 or 45 min), and completed 150-270 min before exercise."
https://openalex.org/W3160379257,"Visceral Leishmaniasis and HIV-AIDS coinfection (VL/HIV) is considered a life-threatening pathology when undiagnosed and untreated, due to the immunosuppression caused by both diseases. Serological tests largely used for the VL diagnosis include the direct agglutination test (DAT), ELISA and immunochromatographic (ICT) assays. For VL diagnosis in HIV infections, different studies have shown that the use of the DAT assay facilitates the VL diagnosis in co-infected patients, since the performance of the most widely used ELISA and ICT tests, based on the recombinant protein rK39, are much less efficient in HIV co-infections. In this scenario, alternative recombinant antigens may help the development of new serological diagnostic methods which may improve the VL diagnosis for the co-infection cases. This work aimed to evaluate the use of the recombinant Lci2 antigen, related to, but antigenically more diverse than rK39, for VL diagnosis in co-infected sera through ELISA assays. A direct comparison between recombinant Lci2 and rK39 was thus carried out. The two proteins were first tested using indirect ELISA with sera from VL afflicted individuals and healthy controls, with similar performances. They were then tested with two different sets of VL/HIV co-infected cases and a significant drop in performance, for one of these groups, was observed for rK39 (32% sensitivity), but not for Lci2 (98% sensitivity). In fact, an almost perfect agreement (Kappa: 0.93) between the Lci2 ELISA and DAT was observed for the coinfected VL/HIV patients. Lci2 then has the potential to be used as a new tool for the VL diagnosis of VL/HIV co-infections."
https://openalex.org/W3161547367,"ARHGAP36 is an atypical Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family member that drives both spinal cord development and tumorigenesis, acting in part through an N-terminal motif that suppresses protein kinase A and activates Gli transcription factors. ARHGAP36 also contains isoform-specific N-terminal sequences, a central GAP-like module, and a unique C-terminal domain, and the functions of these regions remain unknown. Here we have mapped the ARHGAP36 structure-activity landscape using a deep sequencing-based mutagenesis screen and truncation mutant analyses. Using this approach, we have discovered several residues in the GAP homology domain that are essential for Gli activation and a role for the C-terminal domain in counteracting an N-terminal autoinhibitory motif that is present in certain ARHGAP36 isoforms. In addition, each of these sites modulates ARHGAP36 recruitment to the plasma membrane or primary cilium. Through comparative proteomics, we also have identified proteins that preferentially interact with active ARHGAP36, and we demonstrate that one binding partner, prolyl oligopeptidase-like protein, is a novel ARHGAP36 antagonist. Our work reveals multiple modes of ARHGAP36 regulation and establishes an experimental framework that can be applied towards other signaling proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3162348493,"This study was to explore the application value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image reconstruction model based on complex convolutional neural network (CCNN) in the diagnosis and prognosis of cerebral infarction. Two image reconstruction methods, frequency domain reconstruction network (FDRN) and image domain reconstruction network (IDRN), were introduced based on the CCNN algorithm. In addition, they were integrated to form two new MRI image reconstruction models, namely D-FDRN and D-IDRN. The peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) value and structural similarity index measure (SSIM) value of the image were compared and analyzed before and after the integration. The MRI images of patients with cerebral infarction in the dataset were undertaken as the data source, the average diffusion coefficient (DCavg) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of different parts of the MRI image were measured, respectively. The correlation of the vein abnormality grading (VABG) to the infarct size and the degree of stenosis of the responsible vessel was analyzed in this study. The results showed that the PSNR and SSIM values of the MRI reconstructed image of the D-IDRN algorithm based on the CCNN algorithm in this study were higher than those of other algorithms. There was a positive correlation between the VABG and the infarct size (r = 0.48 and P = 0.002), and there was a positive correlation between the VABG the degree of stenosis of the responsible vessel (r = 0.58 and P < 0.0001). The ADC value of the central area of the infarct on the affected side was significantly greatly lower than that of the normal side (P < 0.01), and the DCavg value of the central area of the infarct was much lower in contrast to the normal side (P < 0.05). It indicated that an image reconstruction algorithm constructed in this study could improve the quality of MRI images. The ADC value and DCavg value changed in the infarct central area could be used as the basis for the diagnosis of cerebral infarction. If the vein was abnormal, the patient suffered from severe vascular stenosis, large infarction area, and poorer prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3162607520,"Cathelicidin (CRAMP) is a defence peptide with a wide range of biological responses including antimicrobial, immunomodulatory and wound healing. Due to its original properties the usefulness of CRAMP in the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis was assessed in a murine model of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). The studies were conducted on mouse strain C57BL/6J exposed to a saline extract of Pantoea agglomerans cells (HP inducer). Cathelicidin was administered in the form of an aerosol during and after HP development. Changes in the composition of immune cell populations (NK cells, macrophages, lymphocytes: Tc, Th, Treg, B), were monitored in lung tissue by flow cytometry. Extracellular matrix deposition (collagens, hydroxyproline), the concentration of cytokines involved in inflammatory and the fibrosis process (IFNγ, TNFα, TGFβ1, IL1β, IL4, IL5, IL10, IL12α, IL13) were examined in lung homogenates by the ELISA method. Alterations in lung tissue morphology were examined in mouse lung sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin as well as Masson trichrome dyes. The performed studies revealed that cathelicidin did not cause any negative changes in lung morphology/structure, immune cell composition or cytokines production. At the same time, CRAMP attenuated the immune reaction induced by mice chronic exposure to P. agglomerans and inhibited hydroxyproline and collagen deposition in the lung tissue of mice treated with bacteria extract. The beneficial effect of CRAMP on HP treatment was associated with restoring the balance in quantity of immune cells, cytokines production and synthesis of extracellular matrix components. The presented study suggests the usefulness of cathelicidin in preventing lung fibrosis; however, cathelicidin was not able to reverse pathological changes completely."

If the evoked study is focused on comparing prosocial behaviors in two very different national cultures (UK vs. Iran), we compared helping strangers strategies within the same national culture in relation to the regional identities of the help-seeking subjects. A behavioral scenario was created by asking naïve participants to offer support and give directions to a place even if they did not know its whereabouts. Drawing on social identity theory, it was tested whether regional belonging of the help-seeker (in-group vs. out-group) predicts the availability of help-givers for offering help, their availability for giving wrong directions, as well as their emotional expressiveness. Results are interpreted within the perspective of social distance between groups and show that the more distant regional identities are perceived to be, the less generous help-givers are, both in terms of their decision to help and to give wrong directions, as well as in their expressed emotions."
https://openalex.org/W3163249571,"To manage the increasing burden of dental diseases, a robust health system is essential. In order to ensure the oral health system operates at an optimal level going into the future, a forecast of the national shortfall of dentists and dental specialists in South Africa (SA) was undertaken. There is currently a shortage of dentists and specialists in SA and given the huge burden of dental diseases, there is a dire need to increase the number of these health care workers. The aim was to determine the projected shortfall of dentists and specialists in each of the nine provinces in SA. The projected shortfall was calculated based on the SA Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) for each province. The estimate for the evaluation of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) for SA was obtained from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease website. For each province, age standardized DALYs were calculated with mid-year population estimates obtained from Statistics SA 2018. In order to reduce the existing human resources for health (HRH) inequity among the provinces of SA, three scenarios were created focussing on attaining horizontal equity. The best-case scenario estimates a shortfall of 430, 1252 and 1885 dentists and specialists in 2018, 2024 and 2030 respectively. In an optimistic scenario, the national shortfall was calculated at 733, 1540 and 2158 dentists and specialists for the years 2018, 2024 and 2030 respectively. In an aspirational scenario, shortfalls of 853 (2018), 1655 (2024) and 2267 (2030) dentists and specialists were forecasted. Access to oral health services should be ensured through the optimum supply of trained dentists and specialists and the delivery of appropriate oral health services. Thus, the roadmap provided for upscaling the oral health services recognizes the influence of both demand and supply factors on the pursuit of equity."
https://openalex.org/W3163254069,"TRIM32 is an E3 ligase implicated in diverse biological pathways and pathologies such as muscular dystrophy and cancer. TRIM32 are expressed both as full-length proteins, and as a truncated protein. The mechanisms for regulating these isoforms are poorly understood. Here we identify a PEST sequence in TRIM32 located in the unstructured region between the RING-BBox-CoiledCoil domains and the NHL repeats. The PEST sequence directs cleavage of TRIM32, generating a truncated protein similarly to the short isoform. We map three lysine residues that regulate PEST mediated cleavage and auto-ubiquitylation activity of TRIM32. Mimicking acetylation of lysine K247 completely inhibits TRIM32 cleavage, while the lysines K50 and K401 are implicated in auto-ubiquitylation activity. We show that the short isoform of TRIM32 is catalytic inactive, suggesting a dominant negative role. These findings uncover that TRIM32 is regulated by post-translational modifications of three lysine residues, and a conserved PEST sequence."
https://openalex.org/W3163690629,"Behavioral genetics in non-model organisms is currently gated by technological limitations. However, with the growing availability of genome editing and functional genomic tools, complex behavioral traits such as social behavior can now be explored in diverse organisms. Here we present a minimally invasive neurosurgical procedure for a classic behavioral, ecological and evolutionary system: threespine stickleback ( Gasterosteus aculeatus ). Direct brain injection enables viral-mediated transgenesis and pharmaceutical delivery which bypasses the blood-brain barrier. This method is flexible, fast, and amenable to statistically powerful within-subject experimental designs, making it well-suited for use in genetically diverse animals such as those collected from natural populations. Developing this minimally invasive neurosurgical protocol required 1) refining the anesthesia process, 2) building a custom surgical rig, and 3) determining the normal recovery pattern allowing us to clearly identify warning signs of failure to thrive. Our custom-built surgical rig (publicly available) and optimized anesthetization methods resulted in high (90%) survival rates and quick behavioral recovery. Using this method, we detected changes in aggression from the overexpression of either of two different genes, arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) and monoamine oxidase ( MAOA ), in outbred animals in less than one month. We successfully used multiple promoters to drive expression, allowing for tailored expression profiles through time. In addition, we demonstrate that widely available mammalian plasmids work with this method, lowering the barrier of entry to the technique. By using repeated measures of behavior on the same fish before and after transfection, we were able to drastically reduce the necessary sample size needed to detect significant changes in behavior, making this a viable approach for examining genetic mechanisms underlying complex social behaviors."

At baseline and day 28, fasting body weight and fed-state BOLD fMRI of the brain were assessed. Differences in fMRI signals between views of low-fat (LF (<30%)) high sugar (HS (>30%)) food, and non-food images were calculated in brain regions implicated in energy homeostasis, taste, and reward.All participants in the SSB (6F 4M; 8 Caucasian; 36±14 y, 28.2±5.5 kg/m2; Mean±SD) and SSS (3F 7M; 6 Caucasian; 39±12; 26.3±4.4) groups completed the study. Weight change was 0.27±0.78 kg between SSB and SSS participants. Changes in the fMRI response to LF/HS foods in reward, homeostatic and taste regions tended to not be different between the groups over the four weeks. However, activation of the right substantia nigra increased following the SSB but decreased activation following the SSS in response to LF/HS foods over 28 days (-0.32±0.12). Ratings of wanting for LF/HS foods were correlated with activation in several brain regions, including the OFC.Change in weight was modest between the groups in this study. Daily consumption of a SSB over 28 days led to mixed responses to LF/HS foods in areas of the brain associated with reward. Ratings of wanting are correlated with fMRI activation inside an MRI scanner."

This study describes a patient-centered process of testing and refinement of a new website (www.transplantcentersearch.org) that was developed to provide data to patients who are seeking a transplant center. Mixed methods, including online surveys and structured usability testing, were conducted to inform changes in an iterative process. Survey data from 684 participants indicated the effects of different icon styles on user decisions. Qualitative feedback from 38 usability testing participants informed improvements to the website interface. The mixed methods approach was feasible and well suited to the need to address multiple development steps of a patient-facing tool. The combined methods allowed for large survey sample sizes and also allowed interaction with a functioning website and in-depth qualitative discussions. The approach is applicable for a broad range of target user groups who are faced with challenging decisions and a need for information tailored to individual users. The survey and usability testing concluded with a functioning website that is positively received by users and meets the objective to support patient decisions when seeking an organ transplant."
https://openalex.org/W3163698184,"Delirium is the most common postsurgical neurological complication and has a variable incidence rate. Laparoscopic surgery, when associated with the Trendelenburg position, can cause innumerable physiological changes and increase the risk of neurocognitive changes. The association of general anesthesia with a spinal block allows the use of lower doses of anesthetic agents for anesthesia maintenance and facilitates better control over postoperative pain. Our primary outcome was to assess whether a spinal block influences the incidence of delirium in oncologic patients following laparoscopic surgery in the Trendelenburg position. Our secondary outcome was to analyze whether there were other associated factors. A total of 150 oncologic patients who underwent elective laparoscopic surgeries in the Trendelenburg position were included in this randomized controlled trial. The patients were randomized into 2 groups: the general anesthesia group and the general anesthesia plus spinal block group. Patients were immediately evaluated during the postoperative period and monitored until they were discharged, to rule out the presence of delirium. Delirium occurred in 29 patients in total (22.3%) (general anesthesia group: 30.8%; general anesthesia plus spinal block: 13.8% p = 0.035). Patients who received general anesthesia had a higher risk of delirium than patients who received general anesthesia associated with a spinal block (odds ratio = 3.4; 95% confidence interval: 1.2–9.6; p = 0.020). Spinal block was associated with reduced delirium incidence in oncologic patients who underwent elective laparoscopic surgeries in the Trendelenburg position."
https://openalex.org/W3163728728,"Opportunistic bacteria strategically dampen their virulence to allow them to survive and propagate in hosts. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying virulence control are not clearly understood. Here, we found that the opportunistic pathogen Vibrio vulnificus biotype 3, which caused an outbreak of severe wound and intestinal infections associated with farmed tilapia, secretes significantly less virulent multifunctional autoprocessing repeats-in-toxin (MARTX) toxin, which is the most critical virulence factor in other clinical Vibrio strains. The biotype 3 MARTX toxin contains a cysteine protease domain (CPD) evolutionarily retaining a unique autocleavage site and a distinct β-flap region. CPD autoproteolytic activity is attenuated following its autocleavage because of the β-flap region. This β-flap blocks the active site, disabling further autoproteolytic processing and release of the modularly structured effector domains within the toxin. Expression of this altered CPD consequently results in attenuated release of effectors by the toxin and significantly reduces the virulence of V. vulnificus biotype 3 in cells and in mice. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that this virulence mechanism is shared in all biotype 3 strains.

Strains of V. vulnificus are classified into three biotypes based on their biochemical characteristics and phylogeny: biotype 1 strains such as MO6-24/O and CMCP6 cause the majority of human infections responsible for the entire spectrum of illness, including primary septicemia; biotype 2 strains are primarily eel pathogens; and biotype 3 strains, such as strain BAA87, cause wound infections and bacteremia and possess hybrid biochemical properties of both biotypes 1 and 2 (3Hernandez-Cabanyero C.

Comparative genomic analysis revealed that biotype 3 is a distinct clone descended from the parental environmental population that acquired pathogenic potential by horizontal gene transfer from other Vibrio strains (9Koton Y.

The biotype 3 MARTX toxin harbors a distinct effector content derived from a putative progenitor MARTX toxin of the biotype 1 strain that contributes to the significantly reduced virulence of the strain (10Kim B.S.

However, the mechanisms by which the distinct effector content of the biotype 3 MARTX toxin leads to reduced pathogenicity are unclear. MARTX toxins secreted by many bacterial pathogens contain disease-related, modularly structured effector domains that are released via processing events upon entry into host cells (16Lee Y. Kim B.S.

The diversity of MARTX toxin effector domains correlates with distinct cytopathicities or cytotoxicities and with the overall toxicity of MARTX toxin-expressing strains (19Satchell K.J.

The cysteine protease domain (CPD) located at the end of the effector domain regions of all MARTX toxins directs the proteolytic processing of effector modules after it undergoes activation and autocleavage by binding to cytosolic inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) (17Lupardus P.J.

A. 2019; 116: 18031-18040Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Our previous study revealed that effector domains within the biotype 3 MARTX toxin are unusually processed by its internal CPD and domain X effector (DmX, a homolog of MCF) (16Lee Y. Kim B.S. Choi S. Lee E.Y. Park S. Hwang J. Kwon Y. Hyun J. Lee C. Kim J.F. Eom S.H. Kim M.H.

A. 2019; 116: 18031-18040Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The CPD of biotype 3 MARTX toxin lacks the proteolytic function to process its associated effector domains, even though it has autocleavage activity in the presence of InsP6. In addition, only DmX is released from the toxin by the allosteric activator ARF after autocleavage and detachment from the autocleaved CPD, suggesting that these distinctive processing pathways may be correlated with the toxin potency and therefore the reduced virulence of this strain. These previous data led us to hypothesize that the opportunistic biotype 3 strain has evolved to promote fitness in the host (e.g., tilapia) by relieving MARTX toxin-mediated virulence. In this study, we found that the biotype 3 MARTX toxin CPD evolved to contain an atypical N-terminal autocleavage site and a distinct C-terminal β-flap region that attenuates the autoproteolytic activity of the CPD required for the processing of associated effector domains, which leads to significantly reduced virulence in cells and mice. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that the V. vulnificus biotype 3 strains evolved to retain the atypical CPD and thus have lower MARTX toxin–driven pathogenicity than biotype 1 and 2 strains, which maintain the functional MARTX toxin and exhibit potent virulence. Our previous study showed that the internal CPD (CPDBAA87) of MARTX toxin secreted by the V. vulnificus biotype 3 clinical strain BAA87 (MARTXBAA87) does not process its associated effector domains, even though CPDBAA87 itself is autocleaved in the presence of InsP6 (16Lee Y. Kim B.S. Choi S. Lee E.Y. Park S. Hwang J. Kwon Y. Hyun J. Lee C. Kim J.F. Eom S.H. Kim M.H. Makes caterpillars floppy-like effector-containing MARTX toxins require host ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) proteins for systemic pathogenicity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 18031-18040Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). A multiple sequence alignment of CPDs within MARTX toxins expressed by different Vibrio species, including V. vulnificus and Vibrio cholerae, revealed that CPDBAA87 has a distinct unique sequence (A4090-W4091-T4092) instead of the conventional cleavage sequence, which is known as an X1-L-X2 motif (where X1 and X2 are small amino acids such as Ala and Ser) (21Shen A. Lupardus P.J. Albrow V.E. Guzzetta A. Powers J.C. Garcia K.C. Bogyo M. Mechanistic and structural insights into the proteolytic activation of Vibrio cholerae MARTX toxin.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The other distinctive feature of CPDBAA87 is the C-terminal region corresponding to the β-flap in the CPD (CPDcholerae) of the V. cholerae MARTX toxin, which plays a critical role in InsP6 binding and enzymatic function (17Lupardus P.J. Shen A. Bogyo M. Garcia K.C. Small molecule-induced allosteric activation of the Vibrio cholerae RTX cysteine protease domain.Science. 2008; 322: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of this region in CPDBAA87 is significantly different from that of other CPDs (Fig. 1A). To identify the autocleavage site of CPDBAA87, we carried out an in vitro autocleavage assay using N-terminally extended CPDBAA87 in the presence of InsP6 and analyzed the product by Edman sequencing. As expected, CPDBAA87 was not processed at the unique sequence AWT. Rather, it was autocleaved between Leu4067 and Glu4068 (Fig. 1B), which is located 24 amino acids upstream of X1-L-X2, the conventional autocleavage site of other CPDs (Fig. 1A). Based on these results, we hypothesized that CPDBAA87 may have evolved to function differently from other CPDs to control the virulence of the biotype 3 strain via the MARTX toxin. To test this hypothesis, we mutated the unique sequence AWT to ALA and analyzed the autocleavage activity. The mutant CPD (CPDAWT/ALA) was preferentially and efficiently (comparable activity with CPDMO6-24/O of the MO6-24/O strain) autocleaved at the ALA site rather than at its authentic cleavage site, VLE (Fig. 1C). The cleavage sequence, ALA, was confirmed by Edman sequencing. The autocleavage activity at the VLE site was much weaker in CPDBAA87 than in CPDMO6-24/O (Fig. 1C). Noticeably, the autocleavage motif of CPDBAA87 contains a bulky side chain residue (glutamate), whereas the conventional cleavage motif has small amino acid residues at positions X1 and X2 (21Shen A. Lupardus P.J. Albrow V.E. Guzzetta A. Powers J.C. Garcia K.C. Bogyo M. Mechanistic and structural insights into the proteolytic activation of Vibrio cholerae MARTX toxin.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that this difference may cause the reduced autocleavage activity. Substitution of the VLE motif with ALA increased the autocleavage activity to a lever higher than that of WT CPDBAA87 (Fig. 1D). It should be noted that migration of the mutant CPD by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was faster than that of WT CPDBAA87. Collectively, these data suggest that CPDBAA87 is an altered CPD that evolved to moderate the virulence of the MARTX toxin. To uncover the molecular basis of the reduced function of CPDBAA87 with respect to both its autocleavage and the processing of associated effectors, we initially tried to crystallize the autocleaved CPDBAA87, covering Glu4068–Asp4300, but could ultimately only crystallize CPD by deletion of its N-terminal region (Ala4090–Asp4300), suggesting that the N-terminal Glu4068–Asp4089 region may be flexible and not crystallizable. Its structure was determined at a resolution of 2.2 Å (Table S1). It should be noted that the expression construct of CPDBAA87 for crystallization included an N-terminal hexahistidine-tag, a tobacco etch virus protease recognition site, and restriction enzyme cloning site-derived residues (AM), followed by the unique sequence A4090-W4091-T4092 (Fig. S1A). When incubated with InsP6, the CPD was autocleaved at the AMA4090 site because of its high similarity to the conventional CPD autocleavage sequence (ALA). Purified CPD starts at Ala4090 (Fig. S1B), indicating that the determined structure is a representative autocleaved conformation of CPDBAA87 lacking the flexible N-terminal Glu4068–Asp4089 fragment. The overall structure of the CPDBAA87 is similar to that of CPDcholerae. Its catalytic domain (Asn4099–Ser4262), which shows the most similarity with CPDcholerae, contains a seven-stranded β-sheet with five central parallel strands and two antiparallel capping strands flanked by three helices (Fig. 2, A and B). CPDBAA87 also contains a β-flap region (Ala4265–Lys4288) that has an entirely different conformation from the corresponding region of CPDcholerae (Fig. 2, A and C and Fig. S2). Although InsP6 binds to CPDBAA87 covering residues 4056 to 4300 and residues 4090 to 4300 with binding affinity constants (Kd) of 3.95 and 2.43 μM, respectively (Fig. S3), an electron density map of the molecule could not be found, and thus, the structure model does not include InsP6 (see below). CPDcholerae forms a positively charged pocket for InsP6 binding that is required for active site opening (17Lupardus P.J. Shen A. Bogyo M. Garcia K.C. Small molecule-induced allosteric activation of the Vibrio cholerae RTX cysteine protease domain.Science. 2008; 322: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The structural integrity of the β-flap in CPDcholerae is essential for forming both the pocket and the substrate-binding cleft adjacent to the dyad active residues. The residues Arg3610, Lys3611, and Lys3623 on the β-flap play critical roles in maintaining the integrity of the β-flap (Fig. 2D, upper panels) (17Lupardus P.J. Shen A. Bogyo M. Garcia K.C. Small molecule-induced allosteric activation of the Vibrio cholerae RTX cysteine protease domain.Science. 2008; 322: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although all residues involved in formation of the InsP6-binding pocket in CPDcholerae are strictly conserved in CPDBAA87, including Arg3610, Lys3611, and Lys3623, the structure of CPDBAA87 reveals a dissimilar conformation of the pocket (Fig. 2D, lower panels). In the structure of CPDcholerae, the region Gly3567–Phe3579, which includes the active residue Cys3568, forms a flexible long loop and exposes the active site to solvent (Fig. 2B). CPDBAA87 shows a different structural conformation in that the C terminal half of the corresponding region Asp4237–Phe4243 (Asp3573–Phe3579 in CPDcholerae) is incorporated into the third helix of CPDBAA87, resulting in a longer helix (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the β-hairpin in the β-flap region in CPDBAA87 is rotated about 105° clockwise relative to the corresponding β-hairpin in CPDcholerae (Fig. 2C). These structural changes in CPDBAA87 are facilitated by several hydrogen bonds between His4183 and Ser4233, Gln4240 and Ser4264, Asp4237 and Ser4291, and Tyr4277 and Asn4290, as well as successive layers of hydrophobic interactions that allow the N-terminal Trp4091 to cover the crater-like hydrophobic surface (Fig. 2E). These events consequently change the locations of Arg4274, Lys4275, and Lys4287, which correspond to the residues Arg3610, Lys3611, and Lys3623 on the β-flap in CPDcholerae, moving them further from the InsP6-binding site (Fig. 2D, lower panels) and force the active residue Cys4232 into an improper position away from the other active residue, His4183 (Fig. 2C). Overall, these data suggest that CPDBAA87 that is autocleaved at the site V4066-L4067-E4068 constitutes an atypically structured CPD because of significant conformational changes in the N-terminal flexible region spanning Glu4068–Ala4090, the Trp4091 that caps the C-terminal hydrophobic region following the β-hairpin, the conserved catalytic core domain, and the C-terminal β-flap region, which forms a shield together with Trp4091 to block the active site (Fig. 3A). Consequently, unlike autocleaved CPDcholerae (Fig. 3B), the autocleaved CPDBAA87 becomes nonfunctional with respect to the processing of linker regions between associated effector domains within the MARTX toxin. We believe that the unavailability of an electron density map of InsP6 may be a consequence of the significantly changed conformation of the β-flap region after autocleavage of CPDBAA87 (Fig. 3, A and B), which alters the locations of residues critical for InsP6 binding (Arg4274, Lys4275, and Lys4287) (Fig. 2D). Mutation of Lys3611 or Lys3623 in CPDcholerae, which correspond to Lys4275 and Lys4287 in CPD BAA87, abolished InsP6 binding (17Lupardus P.J. Shen A. Bogyo M. Garcia K.C. Small molecule-induced allosteric activation of the Vibrio cholerae RTX cysteine protease domain.Science. 2008; 322: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The autocleavage activity of CPDMO6-24/O was much greater than that of CPDBAA87 (Fig. 1C). To elucidate the role of the β-flap in the regulation of the enzymatic function of CPDBAA87, we generated a chimeric CPDBAA87 (CPDBAA87/β-flapMO6-24/O) in which the β-flap is substituted with the β-flap of CPDMO6-24/O (β-flapMO6-24/O). The chimeric CPDBAA87/β-flapMO6-24/O showed very low autocleavage activity (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the parental β-flap region is necessary for autocleavage in conjunction with the extensional N-terminal region of CPDBAA87. Mutation of the unique sequence AWT to ALA in CPDBAA87/β-flapMO6-24/O (CPDBAA87/ALA/β-flapMO6-24/O) to mimic CPDMO6-24/O resulted in comparable autocleavage activity to that of CPDMO6-24/O (Fig. 4B). Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy analysis revealed that there are no significant structural differences between CPD variants and WT CPDBAA87 (Fig. S4) We further evaluated the roles of the extended N-terminal region containing the unique autocleavage site and the β-flap region in CPDBAA87 in MARTX toxin activation. Consistent with the previous results, CPDBAA87 was incapable of processing the effector domains within MARTXBAA87 even though it was autocleaved in the presence of InsP6 (Fig. 4C). The mutant CPDBAA87/ALA showing similar autocleavage activity as CPDMO6-24/O (Fig. 1C) also showed no effector processing activity (Fig. 4C). However, CPDBAA87/β-flapMO6-24/O was processed between the Rho GTPase-inactivation domain (RID) and the alpha/beta hydrolase domain (ABH), although its autocleavage activity was reduced, as shown in Figure 4A, suggesting that this chimeric CPD forms an open conformation of the active site. The mutant CPDBAA87/ALA/β-flapMO6-24/O showed similar processing activity as CPDBAA87/β-flapMO6-24/O (Fig. 4C). Consistent with these results, the affinities of the chimeric proteins for InsP6 were lower than that of the WT (Fig. S5). These data suggest that the extended N-terminal region, including the distinct autocleavage site VLE and the β-flap in CPDBAA87, has evolved to have moderate autocleavage activity and reduced effector domain processing, which may significantly reduce the MARTX toxin-mediated virulence of the biotype 3 strain. Full activation of the MARTX toxin effector domains depends on internal proteases such as CPD and MCF that cleave the toxin, releasing the effector domains, which dysregulate host cell functions (16Lee Y. Kim B.S. Choi S. Lee E.Y. Park S. Hwang J. Kwon Y. Hyun J. Lee C. Kim J.F. Eom S.H. Kim M.H.

Small molecule-induced allosteric activation of the Vibrio cholerae RTX cysteine protease domain.Science. 2008; 322: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To assess whether the processing activity of CPDBAA87 directly influences the virulence of the MARTX toxin, we utilized a variant of the V. vulnificus MO6-24/O strain in which exotoxins including hemolysin, elastase, secretory protease, and secretory phospholipase A2 were deleted to evaluate MARTX toxin-specific effects (16Lee Y. Kim B.S. Choi S. Lee E.Y. Park S. Hwang J. Kwon Y. Hyun J. Lee C. Kim J.F. Eom S.H. Kim M.H. Makes caterpillars floppy-like effector-containing MARTX toxins require host ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) proteins for systemic pathogenicity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 116: 18031-18040Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The MARTX toxin of the engineered V. vulnificus MO6-24/O strain (the parental strain) was substituted with MARTXBAA87 by exchanging the MCF and CPDMO6-24/O with the ExoY-like adenylate cyclase domain (ExoY), DmX, and CPDBAA87 of MARTXBAA87 (MO6-24/O/MARTXBAA87 strain) (Fig. 5A). The CPDBAA87 of the MO6-24/O/MARTXBAA87 strain was further engineered into a CPDMO6-24/O-mimicking enzyme (MO6-24/O/MARTXBAA87/CPDMO6-24/O-mimic strain) (Fig. 5A). We first evaluated the virulence of the engineered strains in infected HeLa cells by measuring cell rounding, which is caused by inhibition of Rho GTPase via the effector RID within the MARTX toxin (22Sheahan K.-L. Fullner Satchell K.J. Inactivation of small Rho GTPases by the multifunctional RTX toxin from Vibrio cholerae.Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Ahrens S. Geissler B. Satchell K.J.

Chem. 2013; 288: 1397-1408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Most cells infected with the parental strain became rounded by 120 min, whereas cell rounding was significantly reduced in cells infected with the MO6-24/O/MARTXBAA87 strain (Fig. 5, B and C). The strain containing the CPDMO6-24/O-mimicking enzyme showed comparable virulence to the parental strain (Fig. 5, B and C). These results further suggest that the structural modulation of CPDBAA87 is linked to the significantly reduced virulence of the biotype 3 strain through inhibition of MARTX toxin processing. We further assessed the significance of MARTX toxin processing by CPDBAA87 during the pathogenesis of V. vulnificus in vivo. Mice challenged with the MO6-24/O/MARTXBAA87 strain showed 50% mortality at 48 h postinfection (hpi), whereas the parental strain resulted in 100% mortality within 15 hpi (Fig. 5D). Strikingly, no mice challenged with the strain containing the CPDMO6-24/O-mimicking enzyme survived at 15 hpi, which is comparable with the mortality of the parental strain, further demonstrating that the structural modulation of CPDBAA87 is the determinant of the virulence moderation of V. vulnificus biotype 3 strains. Opportunistic pathogens evolutionarily alter their virulence for adaptation to the environment and to facilitate infection of susceptible hosts (24Diard M. Hardt W.D. Evolution of bacterial virulence.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2017; 41: 679-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that the opportunistic pathogen V. vulnificus biotype 3, which caused an outbreak in humans associated with tilapia farming, may have evolved a form of an MARTX toxin with attenuated virulence. This may have allowed it to persist in the host for a longer time. MARTX toxins are expressed across multiple bacterial species and genera and are considered the primary virulence factors of V. vulnificus (13Jeong H.G. Satchell K.J. Additive function of"
https://openalex.org/W3163382540,"Introduction Iodine deficiency disorder a common problem in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It affects not only the health of the affected individual but also the economic development of the country. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a scarcity in literature about the associated factors of iodized salt utilization in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, this study aimed to identify both individual and community level determinants of iodized salt utilization in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods This study used the appended datasets of the most recent demographic and health survey from 31 sub-Saharan countries. A total weighted sample of 391,463 households was included in the study. Both bivariable and multivariable multilevel logistic regression were done to determine the associated factors of iodized salt utilization in SSA. P value ≤ 0.05 was used to declare statistically significant variables. Results Those households with primary (AOR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.50–1.57), secondary (AOR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.76–1.86) and higher education level (AOR = 2.28, 95% CI = 2.17–2.40) had higher odds of iodized salt utilization. Households with middle (AOR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02–1.08), richer (AOR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.09–1.17) and richest wealth index (AOR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.18–1.28) also had an increased chance of using iodized salt. Households from high community media exposure (AOR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.71–2.51), high community education level (AOR = 3.78, 95% CI = 3.14–4.56), and low community poverty level (AOR = 1.29, CI = 1.07–1.56) had higher odds of using salt containing iodine. Conclusion Both individual and community level factors were found to be associated with use of salt containing iodine in sub-Saharan Africa. Education level, media exposure, community poverty level, wealth index, community education, and community media exposure were found to be associated with use of salt containing iodine in SSA. Therefore, to improve the use of iodized salt in the region, there is a need to increase access to media sources and develop the socioeconomic status of the community."
