https://openalex.org/W2125523734,"Pictures of common objects, coming slowly into focus, were viewed by adult observers. Recognition was delayed when subjects first viewed the pictures out of focus. The greater or more prolonged the initial blur, the slower the eventual recognition. Interference may be accounted for partly by the difficulty of rejecting incorrect hypotheses based on substandard cues."
https://openalex.org/W2026711213,A line of fibroblast cells has been established from tongue tissue of the bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana). The cells are near-triploid and were subcultured 57 times during the 2â…” years of their existence. Some of their characteristics are described.

https://openalex.org/W2076594902,"Alkaline phosphatase activity of the mouse duodenum normally increases 20-fold between 13 and 20 days. Activity at 15 days is raised two to three times above normal by administering actinomycin D, puromycin, or the aminonucleoside of puromycin at 13 or 14 days. Phosphatase activity in the jejunum and kidney are not similarly affected."
https://openalex.org/W1993445600,"Frog sartorius muscles were isolated, treated with 1-fluoro-2, 4-dini-trobenzene at 0 degrees C, then stimulated tetanically at the length in situ and stretched with a Levin-Wyman ergometer during stimulation. The normal adenosine triphosphate breakdown during the tetanus was reduced by about half during the forced stretch. The tension was increased by about 70 percent, but resynthesis of adenosine triphosphate did not occur. Thus, on the basis of A. V. Hill's results, adenosine triphosphate is probably not the direct final energy source for muscular contraction, although it intimately participates in the process. The use of adenosine triphosphate during negative work was less than one-tenth that needed for positive work."

https://openalex.org/W2125593044,Red-green color discrimination by cats was demonstrated in a situation which effectively eliminated cues based on relative brightness. The persistence of the cat's response to cues based on brightness differences may help to account for the failure of previous experiments to show that cats can make behavioral color discriminations.

https://openalex.org/W1970977738,The maleimide adduct of an unusual fulvene is highly toxic to rats when administered orally or parenterally. It does not induce significant toxic or other biological changes in common house pets and commercially useful mammals and birds when given at dose levels 200 times greater than the dose which is lethal to 50 percent of the rats it is administered to.

https://openalex.org/W2066107634,A number of strains of Plasmodium berghei were isolated from sporozoites of Anopheles dureni. Laboratory-bred Anopheles quadrimaculatus fed on carriers of the newly isolated strains showed overwhelming midgut infections and moderate or mild salivary gland infections. Successive cyclic transmissions by the bite of experimentally infected A. quadrimaculatus in laboratorybred tree rats (Thamnomys surdaster) were carried out.
https://openalex.org/W2152277719,"Preliminary studies of the chemical nature of an antitumor agent from the common quahog, Mercenaria mercenaria, are reported. The agent has a regressive and an inhibiting effect on sarcoma 180 and on Krebs 2 carcinoma in Swiss albino mice."

https://openalex.org/W2063372136,"N-acetyldopamine has been identified as a dihydroxyphenylalanine metabolite in the blowfly imago during eclosion. The activity of the dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase, the main enzyme responsible for its formation, which is minimal during the pupal stage, increases 1 day before eclosion. The similarity of dihydroxyphenylalanine metabolism in Calliphora during eclosion and during puparium formation justifies the assumption that N-acetyldopamine can be regarded as the sclerotizing agent of the imaginal cuticle. It is concluded that the formation of this substance is under the control of ecdysone."

Myocardial infarcts were limited to males of heterosexual pairs and groups and to females of groups that contained 24 chickens. The lesion was found in males that died at 16 to 44 weeks of age, and in females at 32 to 43 weeks."

The importance of arginine is empha- sized by the fact that it is rapidly depleted from the medium in many primary and established cell strains (3). The L-929 fibroblasts maintained in this laboratory and shown to harbor a pleuropneumonia-like infection also demonstrate a.n"

Calf, mouse, and chicken interferons inhibited these enzymes with the same characteristic species specificity observed in tissue culture. A mechanism of action is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1994813574,"Agar electrophoresis of serum from mice of C57BL/10-H-2(d), B10.Sn, A.SW, A.CA, R III, and P1 inbred strains shows that the females have a lower concentration of alpha-1 serum globulin than the males and, in some strains, the females also have a lower concentration of alpha-2 and, beta-serum globulin. Females of the A.SW strain have a higher serum albumin concentration than males, and females of the C57BL/10-H-2(d) strain have a higher gamma-globulin concentration than males. Two-dimensional (agar and hydrolyzed-starch) electrophoresis gives a typical sex-associated pattern for alpha-1 and alpha-2 globulins which clearly permits recognition of male and female serums."

https://openalex.org/W2031406033,"Evoked responses recorded from the amygdala of the cat after sequentially pairing neocortical and hypothalamizic stimulation showed consistent suippression or depression of the response evoked by the test shocks, regardless of whether the cortical or subcortical site received the preceding conditioning shock. The possibility that functional interaction of neocortical and hypothalamic signals occurs in the amygdala is proved and an active inhibitory process is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2078137009,"Thalidomide did not inhibit dehydrogenase activity or growth of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in agar. When mixed with Ehrlich ascites tumor cells in vitro, thalidomide increased the mitotic activity. The effect of the thalidomide was not altered by the addition of nicotinic or folic acid, or by vitamin B1 or B6. Oxygen uptake by the tumor cells was not affected by thalidomide."
https://openalex.org/W1969842577,"Concentrations of the naturally occurring alpha-emitting radioelements, radium-226, radium-228, and lead-210, and of stable lead and fluorine were determined in bone specimens from 32 individuals having a verified osteogenic sarcoma. Comparison of these results with those for the average person showed no significant differences in either the absorbed dose (rad) from the accumulated radioisotopes or in the concentrations of the elements studied."
https://openalex.org/W2011304091,"Short-latency potentials are evoked by auditory stimuli at all loci of neocortex recorded from, including points in orbital-frontal, visual, and somatosensory areas. These potentials are similar in latency and wave form to responses obtained from the primary auditory projection area in higher mammals, but occur in widely varying spatial patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2055084024,The concentration of sialic acid in the anterior pituitary gland of young female rats is approximately 250 micromoles per 100 grams. After ovariectomy there is a marked and persistent rise in pituitary sialic acid; this increase is probably related to the known increase in the production of gonadotrophic hormones.

In the same experiments dipentene was found to the extent of 0.2 percent of the smoke condensate.
