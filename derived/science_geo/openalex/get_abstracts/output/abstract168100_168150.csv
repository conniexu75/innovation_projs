https://openalex.org/W1993129579,"Caspase-8 is believed to play an obligatory role in apoptosis initiation by death receptors, but the role of its structural relative, caspase-10, remains controversial. Although earlier evidence implicated caspase-10 in apoptosis signaling by CD95L and Apo2L/TRAIL, recent studies indicated that these death receptor ligands recruit caspase-8 but not caspase-10 to their death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) even in presence of abundant caspase-10. We characterized a series of caspase-10-specific antibodies and found that certain commercially available antibodies cross-react with HSP60, shedding new light on previous results. The majority of 55 lung and breast carcinoma cell lines expressed mRNA for both caspase-8 and -10; however, immunoblot analysis revealed that caspase-10 protein expression was more frequently absent than that of caspase-8, suggesting a possible selective pressure against caspase-10 production in cancer cells. In nontransfected cells expressing both caspases, CD95L and Apo2L/TRAIL recruited endogenous caspase-10 as well as caspase-8 to their DISC, where both enzymes were proteolytically processed with similar kinetics. Caspase-10 recruitment required the adaptor FADD/Mort1, and caspase-10 cleavage in vitrorequired DISC assembly, consistent with the processing of an apoptosis initiator. Cells expressing only one of the caspases underwent ligand-induced apoptosis, indicating that each caspase can initiate apoptosis independently of the other. Thus, apoptosis signaling by death receptors involves not only caspase-8 but also caspase-10, and both caspases may have equally important roles in apoptosis initiation.

A more recently discovered relative of CD95L, Apo2L/TRAIL (Apo2 ligand or tumor necrosis-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) (2Pitti R.M. Marsters S.A. Ruppert S. Donahue C.J. Moore A. Ashkenazi A. J.

Like most other tumor necrosis factor (TNF)1gene superfamily members, CD95L and Apo2L/TRAIL are homotrimeric, type II transmembrane proteins that interact with corresponding members of the TNF receptor superfamily. CD95L signals apoptosis through the “death” receptor CD95, whereas Apo2L/TRAIL signals apoptosis through the death receptors DR4 and DR5 (5Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M.

Death receptors form a subgroup within the TNF receptor superfamily of type I transmembrane proteins that share sequence homology within a cytoplasmic region defined as the “death domain” (6Tartaglia L.A.

Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 759-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Both ligands trigger a series of protein-protein interactions that assemble a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) at the cytoplasmic death domain of the receptor. Upon ligand binding, CD95, DR4, and DR5 recruit the adaptor molecule FADD/Mort1 (19Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L. Cmonis J.H. Wallach D. J. Biol.

In turn, FADD recruits the zymogen form of the apoptosis-initiating protease caspase-8, through homophilic interaction of “death effector domains” (21Boldin M. Goncharov T. Goltsev Y. Wallach D.

The proximity of caspase-8 zymogens in the DISC facilitates activation through self-processing, leading to cleavage of downstream effector caspases that execute the apoptotic death program. Caspase-10 is closely related by sequence to caspase-8 (23Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A. Tomaselli K.J. Litwack G.

By analogy to caspase-8, it has been proposed that caspase-10 may be involved in apoptosis signaling by death receptors; however, studies investigating this hypothesis have yielded conflicting results. Upon overexpression in transfected cells, TNF receptor 1 and CD95 interacted with caspase-10 (24Vincenz C. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

In addition, investigation of patients with the type II autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, who carry at least one inactivating mutation in the caspase-10 gene (28Wang J. Zheng L. Lobito A.

On the other hand, the results from biochemical analyses of the Apo2L/TRAIL DISC in nontransfected BJAB B lymphoma and Jurkat T leukemia cells, which express both caspase-8 and -10, indicated that DR4 and/or DR5 recruit and activate caspase-8 but not caspase-10 (16Bodmer J.L.

These studies implied that caspase-8 has an obligatory role in death receptor signaling, whereas caspase-10 is neither involved nor important for this function. To reassess the involvement of caspase-10 in death receptor action, we characterized a panel of antibodies that recognize this protein in its three functional isoforms and used these antibodies to examine death receptor-mediated recruitment and processing of caspase-10 in nontransfected cells. Our results demonstrate that both Apo2L/TRAIL and CD95L recruit caspase-10 to their respective DISCs, where it is processed with kinetics similar to those of caspase-8. We found that the commercially available caspase-10/b antibodies that were used in previous studies to demonstrate that caspase-10 is present in certain cell lines but is not recruited by stimulated death receptors (16Bodmer J.L.

By investigating cell lines that express either caspase-8 alone or caspase-10 alone, we demonstrate that each caspase can be recruited to the DISC and processed to initiate apoptosis independently of the other. These results suggest that caspase-8 and caspase-10 both may have important physiologic roles in apoptosis initiation downstream of death receptors. Human B cell lymphoma BJAB were a gift from E.

Sauseville (NCI, National Institutes of Health). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 + 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum + 1000 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The primary antibodies anti-FADD (catalog number F36620) and anti-PARP (catalog number P76420) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); anti-caspase-3 (catalog number 556425) was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA); anti-caspase-8 (catalog number 05-477) was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); anti-Hsp60 (catalog number 804-069-C100) was from Alexis Corporation (San Diego, CA); and anti-FLAG (M2) was from Sigma. Anti-caspase-10 had the following sources: C10.1 (mouse monoclonal, 4B2 (number 2411, a gift from J.

Anti-caspase-10/b antibodies besides C10.6 that showed cross-reactivity to Hsp60 were from Alexis, Upstate Technologies, PharMingen, Oncogene Sciences, and Stressgen; these antibodies cross-reacted also to the bacterial homolog of Hsp60, GroEL (data not shown). Anti-DR4 (3G1) and anti-DR5 (3H1) monoclonal antibodies were generated by using receptor-Fc fusion proteins as antigens. As secondary reagents we used: horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat α-mouse IgG2b (catalog number 1090-05) from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. (Birmingham, AL), HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (catalog number 02287E) from PharMingen, HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (catalog number NA931), and HRP-conjugated streptavidin (catalog number RPN1231) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (catalog number 111-035-144) from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Purified Hsp60 protein (catalog number SPP-742) was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies, Inc. (Collegeville, PA). The ligands, each containing an N-terminal FLAG epitope tag, were purified over an M2-agarose column. Apo2L/TRAIL-FLAG (amino acids 114–281 in pFLAG-MAC; Sigma) was expressed in Escherichia coli. CD95L-FLAG (amino acids 131–281 in pCMV-1; Sigma) was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells). As substrates for immunodetection, either ECLTM(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or SuperSignal® West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce) were used. All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma. These experiments were done essentially as described (15Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J.

If not otherwise stated, the cells (107) were either stimulated for 10 min or the indicated time with ligand (1 μg/ml Apo2L/TRAIL-FLAG or CD95L-FLAG + 2 μg/ml M2) or left untreated (unstimulated). After one wash with phosphate-buffered saline the cells were lysed for 30 min on ice with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.57 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The postnuclear supernatants were collected and rotated at 4 °C for 4–16 h in the presence of 20 μl of protein A/G beads (Pierce) alone or with an indicated antibody. After seven washes with lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitations (IPs) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting and detection through Western blot (WB). Apo2L/TRAIL or CD95L DISCs were immunoprecipitated from 5 × 106 BJAB cells. The IPs were washed four times with lysis buffer and three times with reaction buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm dithiothreitol). Then 40 μl of reaction buffer and 0.5 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled, in vitro translated caspase-8/a, -10/a, -10/b, or -10/d were added to the beads and incubated at room temperature. The in vitro translations were done following the manufacturer's protocol (TNT®quick coupled transcription/translation system) (Promega, Madison, WI) using an 35S-labeled mix of cysteine and methionine (Tran35S-LabelTM, ICN). Alternatively, the DISC IPs were substituted by adding 0.1 μg of purified caspase-8/a or caspase-10/a to the reaction mixture (from PharMingen and BioVision, Palo Alto, CA, respectively). Various time points were taken and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a precast 10% Bis Tris NuPAGETMgel system, and the gels were then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes following the manufacturer's instructions (Novex, San Diego, CA). The blots were air dried for 2 h at 37 °C and exposed to BAS-III imaging plates (Fuji Photo Film Inc., Greenwood, SC). The plates were read using the BAS-2000 IP Scanner with the Image Reader V1.2 software and analyzed with the MacBAS V.2.4 software (Fuji Photo Film Inc.). After SDS-PAGE and electroblotting the membranes were blocked with either 5% milk or 2% fish gelatin (for rabbit antibodies) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20. The dilutions for the primary and secondary antibodies and the developing reagent are indicated in parentheses below. For C10.1, we used either a secondary antibody (1 μg/ml, 1:5000 anti-mouse IgG-HRP, ECL) or coupled the antibody directly to HRP (1:200, ECL). We used the following conditions for the other caspase-10 antibodies: C10.2, C10.5, and C10.6 (1 μg/ml, 1:40000 anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, ECL); C10.3 (1 μg/ml, 1:10000 anti-IgG1-HRP, SuperSignal or 1 μg/ml, 1:5000 anti-mouse IgG-HRP, ECL); or C10.4 (1 μg/ml, 1:5000 anti-mouse IgG-HRP, ECL). For caspase-8 and FADD analysis the membranes were cut at about 32 kDa, and the upper part was probed with anti-caspase-8 (1 μg/ml, 1:20000 anti-IgG2b-HRP, ECL), whereas the lower part was probed with anti-FADD (1 μg/ml, 1:10000 anti-IgG1-HRP, SuperSignal). Other blots were treated with anti-Hsp60 (5 μg/ml, 1:5000 anti-mouse IgG-HRP, ECL), anti-caspase-3 (1:1000, 1:40000 anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, ECL), anti-PARP (1:500, 1:10000 anti-IgG1-HRP, SuperSignal), biotinylated anti-DR4 (3G1), and anti-DR5 (3H1) (1 μg/ml, 1:5000, ECL and SuperSignal). Jurkat (Casp8 def.) were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) essentially following the manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were transfected in 500 μl with 8 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 and 5.5 μg of total DNA (4 μg of green fluorescent protein in pRK5 + 1.5 μg of caspase in pCI). After each transfection cells were split and either left untreated or stimulated with 1 μg/ml Apo2L/TRAIL-FLAG or CD95L-FLAG (both ligands cross-linked with 2 μg/ml M2. After 14 h of incubation, apoptosis was quantified by the percentage of propidium iodide (5 μg/ml)-stained cells in the green fluorescent protein-positive population on a FACScan using the CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The cells (2 × 106) were treated with 1 μg/ml Apo2L/TRAIL-FLAG plus 2 μg/ml M2 for the indicated time, split, and analyzed for phosphatidylserine exposure, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm), and DNA fragmentation by FACScan using the CELLQuest software. Following the manufacturer's instructions Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining was assayed to detect phosphatidylserine exposure on the cell surface (Trevigen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). To measure ΔΨm, the cells were incubated with 3,3-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (460 ng/ml; FL-1) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 10 min at 37 °C in the dark and analyzed by FACScan. The percentage of DNA fragmentation was quantified through analysis of propidium iodide-stained nuclei as described (38Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4438) Google Scholar). Changes in morphology upon apoptosis induction were visualized by confocal microscopy and by Hoechst 33342 staining (Molecular Probes). The Hoechst dye was incubated with the cells for 20 min at room temperature and immediately evaluated by fluorescence microscopy. Caspase-8 has two main isoforms: 8/a and 8/b (39Scaffidi C.

Caspase-10 has four described isoforms, of which three (10/a, 10/b, and 10/d) contain a functional protease domain (40Ng P.W. Porter A.G. Janicke R.U. J. Biol.

To investigate directly whether the DISCs assembled by Apo2L/TRAIL or CD95L can process caspase-10, we isolated each ligand-induced DISC from BJAB lymphoma cells. BJAB cells express DR4, DR5, CD95, caspase-8 (15Kischkel F.C. Lawrence D.A. Chuntharapai A. Schow P. Kim K.J. Ashkenazi A.

Cyr61 is capable of multiple functions, including induction of angiogenesis in vivo. Purified Cyr61 mediates cell adhesion and induces adhesive signaling, stimulates cell migration, enhances cell proliferation, and promotes cell survival in both fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In this study, we have used cDNA array hybridization to identify genes regulated by Cyr61 in primary human skin fibroblasts. The Cyr61-regulated genes fall into several groups known to participate in processes important for cutaneous wound healing, including: 1) angiogenesis and lymphogenesis (VEGF-A and VEGF-C); 2) inflammation (interleukin-1β); 3) extracellular matrix remodeling (MMP1, MMP3, TIMP1, uPA, and PAI-1); and 4) cell-matrix interactions (Col1α1, Col1α2, and integrins α3 and α5). Cyr61-mediated gene expression requires heparin binding activity of Cyr61, cellular de novo transcription, and protein synthesis and is largely dependent on the activation of p42/p44 MAPKs. Cyr61 regulates gene expression not only in serum-free medium but also in fibroblasts cultured on various matrix proteins or in the presence of 10% serum. These effects of Cyr61 can be sustained for at least 5 days, consistent with the time course of wound healingin vivo. Interestingly, Cyr61 can interact with transforming growth factor-β1 to regulate expression of specific genes in an antagonistic, additive, or synergistic manner. Furthermore, we show that the Cyr61 gene is highly induced in dermal fibroblasts of granulation tissue during cutaneous wound repair. Together, these results show that Cyr61 is inducibly expressed in granulation tissues after wounding and that Cyr61 activates a genetic program for wound repair in skin fibroblasts. We propose a model in which Cyr61 integrates its activities on endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages to regulate the processes of angiogenesis, inflammation, and matrix remodeling in the context of cutaneous wound healing.

Purified Cyr61 supports endothelial cell adhesion and induces cell migration through integrin αvβ3, enhances growth factor-induced mitogenesis, and induces neovascularization in rat cornea (6Kireeva M.L.

In addition, Cyr61 enhances chondrogenic differentiation of mouse limb bud mesenchymal cells in micromass cultures, suggesting a role in skeletal development (12Wong M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V.

Cyr61 was shown to elevate type II collagen expression in mesenchymal cells undergoing chondrogenic differentiation (12Wong M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), whereas fibroblasts adhered to Cyr61 express high levels of MMP1 (collagenase-1) and MMP3 (stromelysin-1) (14Chen C.-C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10443-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To understand its function fully, we used cDNA microarray hybridization to identify genes regulated by purified Cyr61 in human dermal fibroblasts. Interestingly, the Cyr61-regulated genes thus identified encode proteins that control angiogenesis, inflammation, ECM remodeling, and cell-ECM interaction, all of which are processes vital for cutaneous wound healing (15Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3659) Google Scholar, 16Singer A.J. Clark R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (4569) Google Scholar, 17Gailit J. Clark R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The notion that Cyr61 is important in wound repair is further supported by the finding that Cyr61expression is highly induced and tightly regulated in granulation tissue during cutaneous wound healing. Furthermore, Cyr61 regulates gene expression in the presence of other ECM molecules or serum growth factors and its effect can last for at least 5 days, consistent with the tissue environment in which healing occurs and the time course of wound healing in vivo. We propose a model in which the inducible expression of Cyr61 in granulation tissue directly and indirectly regulates the processes of inflammation, angiogenesis, matrix remodeling, and cell-ECM interaction during wound repair.DISCUSSIONThe principal finding of this study is that Cyr61, an ECM-associated angiogenic protein, regulates the expression of a genetic program for wound healing in fibroblasts. This conclusion is based on two observations: 1) the Cyr61 gene is inducibly expressed in granulation tissue during wound repair and 2) Cyr61 regulates the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, inflammation, matrix remodeling, and cell-matrix interactions. Thus, the roles of Cyr61 in wound healing extend beyond its activity as an angiogenic inducer and may coordinate multiple events through regulation of specific genes.Purified Cyr61 elicits gene expression changes in human fibroblasts in serum-free medium in a dose-dependent manner. Site-specific mutations in the Cyr61 polypeptide abolished its ability to regulate gene expression, demonstrating that this activity is an intrinsic property of the Cyr61 polypeptide (Fig. 5 A). Cyr61 most likely acts as a matricellular protein (34Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) rather than a conventional growth factor or cytokine, given that it: 1) associates with the ECM upon secretion (35Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar), 2) is structurally related to other ECM proteins such as von Willebrand factor and thrombospondin, 3) supports cell adhesion and induces adhesive signaling, and 4) acts through binding to integrin receptors. The dosage requirements for Cyr61 to regulate different genes vary, ranging from 0.1 to 1 μg/ml (∼2.5–25 nm) for uPA and MMPs (Fig. 3 B) to 1–5 μg/ml for IL-1β, Col1α1, and Col1α2 (Fig. 4 A and data not shown). These effective concentrations are higher than those required of soluble growth factors and cytokines but consistent with the dosage requirements for other matricellular and ECM proteins, such as tenascin, SPARC, collagen, laminin, and the 120-kDa FN fragment, to regulate gene expression (36Tremble P.M.

Although Cyr61 expression is strongly induced by mitogenic signals in fibroblasts (1Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), it should be noted that the actual local concentration of Cyr61 as an ECM-associated molecule in tissues has been difficult to assess.Cyr61 binds heparin with high affinity (35Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar), and the interaction of Cyr61 with cell surface HSPGs is required for it to support fibroblast adhesion (9Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Two lines of evidence showed that Cyr61 regulation of gene expression is also dependent on its capacity to bind heparin: 1) a heparin-binding defective mutant of Cyr61 was unable to regulate gene expression (Fig. 5 A) and 2) soluble heparin, in quantities sufficient to saturate the heparin-binding site of Cyr61, abrogated its ability to enhance gene expression (Fig. 5 B). Interaction with HSPGs alone may not be sufficient, however, because numerous extracellular proteins also can bind heparin but do not have the same activities. It is likely that another cell surface receptor(s), together with HSPGs, may be necessary to determine the specific effects of Cyr61 on gene expression. It is of interest to note that cell surface HSPGs are important for wound healing. For instance, null mutation of the syndecan-4 gene results in dramatically delayed skin wound healing in mice (22Echtermeyer F. Streit M. Wilcox-Adelman S. Saoncella S. Denhez F. Detmar M. Goetinck P.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: R9-R14Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar).Although p42/p44 MAPKs were activated by Cyr61 (Fig. 6 A), the unusually slow kinetics (more than 6 h of exposure to Cyr61 before activation occurs) suggest that activation is mediated through secondary factor(s) induced by Cyr61. This is consistent with the observation that the gene regulation activity of Cyr61 was abrogated by inhibitors of transcription or protein synthesis (Fig. 7). Because the extracellular signal-related kinase kinase inhibitor, PD98059, severely blunted Cyr61 enhancement of gene expression (Fig. 6 B), it follows that the activities of p42/p44 MAPKs may be required for Cyr61 to regulate gene expression. Functional AP-1 elements have been found in the promoter regions of genes encoding IL-1β, VEGF-A, and MMP1, and p42/p44 MAPKs were shown to activate transcription through these AP-1 elements (44Rezzonico R. Chicheportiche R. Imbert V. Dayer J.M. Blood. 2000; 95: 3868-3877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. J. Biol.

Cell Res. 2000; 258: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although p42/p44 MAPKs are also involved in the down-regulation of type 1 collagen gene expression by basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and ceramide (47Reunanen N. Foschi M. Han J. Kahari V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34634-34639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 48Chaudhary L.R. Avioli L.V. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), PD98059 was unable to block Cyr61-suppression of Col1α1 expression (Fig. 6 B). Therefore, alternative pathways for the down-regulation of type 1 collagen must exist. Interestingly, CTGF, a protein closely related to Cyr61 and also expressed in granulation tissue, has been reported to enhance rather than suppress type 1 collagen synthesis in NRK fibroblasts (27Duncan M.R.

Differential utilization of receptors in human skin fibrobasts and NRK fibroblasts for Cyr61 and CTGF may explain the differences in gene expression effects.Cyr61 and CTGF are members of the CCN family, and both are encoded by immediate-early genes that are transcriptionally activated by serum, platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and TGF-β1 (51O'Brien T.P.

Because platelet-derived growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and TGF-β1 are released by activated platelets and damaged tissue upon wounding, the actions of these growth factors may explain the expression of Cyr61 andCTGF in wounds (Fig. 8) (54Igarashi A.

Among the first genes up-regulated by Cyr61 is the angiogenic factor VEGF-A (6 h), consistent with the need for nutrient and oxygen supply to cells of the healing wound. Subsequent expression of VEGF-C may enhance the angiogenic process and/or promote lymph vessel formation (24Jeltsch M. Kaipainen A. Joukov V. Meng X. Lakso M. Rauvala H. Swartz M. Fukumura D.

Although Cyr61 up-regulates both MMPs and their natural inhibitor TIMP1, expression of the proteases (MMP1 and MMP3) precedes that of the inhibitor (TIMP1) (Fig. 3 A). We speculate that elevation of proteases prior to their inhibitors allows ECM degradation to occur in a temporally regulated fashion.A number of ECM proteins are capable of regulating MMP expression in fibroblasts, endothelial cells, or macrophages; these include type 1 collagen (56Haas T.L.

Cell. 2000; 11: 3353-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that FN fragments are capable of up-regulating fibroblast expression of MMPs, IL-1α, and IL-1β but do not affect expression of angiogenic factors such as VEGF-A (38Saito S.

Werner E. Tremble P. Symons M. Werb Z. Science. 1998; 280: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, Cyr61 is the only matricellular protein (34Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) capable of regulating genes that play roles encompassing several major processes in wound repair, including angiogenesis, inflammation, tissue remodeling, and cell-ECM interaction. Furthermore, only Cyr61 has been shown to have long term effects on gene regulation lasting for at least 5 days (Fig. 9 B), consistent with the time course of wound healing in vivo. Importantly, the effects of Cyr61 on gene expression were observed even in cells grown in 10% serum (Fig. 9 B), showing that Cyr61 actions are not mitigated by the presence of serum growth factors. Thus, Cyr61 appears to have more diverse functions in skin wound healing compared with other ECM-associated proteins examined to date.Even though Cyr61 is an immediate-early gene inducible by TGF-β1, the effects of Cyr61 and TGF-β1 on fibroblast gene expression are not identical. Where both are present, the effects of Cyr61 and TGF-β1 on fibroblast gene expression can be antagonistic, additive, or synergistic. The effect of TGF-β1 on MMP1 expression completely overrides that of Cyr61 (Fig. 9 C). During skin wound healing, the peak of TGF-β1 expression correlates with granulation tissue formation when ECM proteins are being actively produced and deposited, whereas the peak of Cyr61 expression occurs about 3 days later, coincident with ECM remodeling and granulation tissue contraction (Fig. 8) (31Frank S. Madlener M. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10188-10193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We speculate that fibroblasts produce more collagen and fewer MMPs during the early phase of wound healing when the level of TGF-β1 is high and that of Cyr61 low, thus favoring a net accumulation of ECM and granulation tissue formation. Subsequently, when TGF-β1 level decreases and Cyr61 is highly expressed, collagen expression is decreased, whereas MMP expression is increased, thus facilitating ECM remodeling.Based on the current study and information available in literature, we propose a working model for the mechanism of Cyr61 action in cutaneous wound healing (Fig. 10). After injury, Cyr61 is produced both by dermal fibroblasts (Fig. 8) and endothelial cells. 2C.-C. Chen, F.-E. Mo, and L. F. Lau, unpublished results. As an ECM-associated signaling protein (8Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 35Yang G.P. Lau L.F.

Kirschling D.J. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21943-21950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although Cyr61 interacts directly with endothelial cells through integrin αvβ3 to induce pro-angiogenic activities (7Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 8Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), it also up-regulates synthesis of VEGF-A and VEGF-C in fibroblasts (Fig. 2), further enhancing the angiogenic potential of the immediate milieu. In addition, Cyr61 enhances fibroblast synthesis of IL-1β, which may act upon macrophages to enhance the inflammatory response. It is of interest to note that macrophage is an important source of growth factors necessary to stimulate fibroplasia and angiogenesis in granulation tissue (16Singer A.J. Clark R.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (4569) Google Scholar). In addition, exposure of fibroblasts to Cyr61 leads to elevated expression of ECM-degrading proteases and their inhibitors, including MMP1, MMP3, TIMP1, uPA, and PAI-1, and down-regulation of type I collagen (Figs. 3 and4 A), thereby leading to ECM remodeling. The expression of provisional matrix integrin subunits α3 and α5 is enhanced by Cyr61 as well (Fig. 4 B). This hypothetical model proposes that in response to wounding, Cyr61 is induced and subsequently activates genes that play multiple and coordinated roles in wound healing, including angiogenesis, inflammation, and ECM remodeling (Fig. 10). The functional roles of Cyr61 in cutaneous wound healing clearly merit further investigation in the context of wounding models in whole animals. Cyr61 is a member of the CCN protein family, which also includes CTGF, Nov, WISP-1, WISP-2, and WISP-3 (1Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 2Brigstock D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). These vertebrate-specific proteins are characterized by a four-domain modular structure that share sequence similarities to insulin-like growth factor binding proteins, von Willebrand factor, thrombospondin, and growth factor cysteine knots (1Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 3Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 4Hynes R.O. Zhao Q. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F89-F96Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of Cyr61 is associated with the cardiovascular and skeletal systems during embryonic development (5O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 645-654PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, Cyr61 can act as both an angiogenic inducer and a chondrogenesis differentiation factor. Purified Cyr61 supports endothelial cell adhesion and induces cell migration through integrin αvβ3, enhances growth factor-induced mitogenesis, and induces neovascularization in rat cornea (6Kireeva M.L.

We now show that the generation of the S3/Notch intracellular domain and APP-carboxyl-terminal fragment γ (CTFγ) derivatives are dependent on PS expression and inhibited by a highly selective and potent γ-secretase inhibitor. Unexpectedly, the APP-CTFγ derivative is generated by processing between Leu-645 and Val-646 (of APP695), several amino acids carboxyl-terminal to the scissile bonds for production of amyloid β protein peptides. Although the relationship of APP-CTFγ to the production of amyloid β protein peptides is not known, we conclude that in contrast to the highly selective PS-dependent processing of Notch, the PS-dependent γ-secretase processing of APP is largely nonselective and occurs at multiple sites within the APP transmembrane domain.

Nature. 2000; 405: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), have led to the conclusion that PS are the molecules that execute intramembranous cleavage of APP and Notch1. Furthermore, PS shares limited homology with the prepilin peptidases, a family of bacterial aspartyl proteases (10Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L.

Although compelling, several observations have questioned the veracity of this model. First, and despite reports showing PS1 to be resident in late compartments, including endosomes and plasma membranes (12Ray W.J. Yao M. Mumm J. Schroeter E.H. Saftig P. Wolfe M. Selkoe D.J. Kopan R.

Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). In the present report, we examine the production of γ-secretase-generated APP and Notch1 derivatives. We now document, both in living cells and cytosol-free membrane preparations, the generation of APP-CTFγ derived from membrane-tethered APP-CTFs. In parallel, we document the production of the Notch S3/NICD in these preparations. The production of the APP-CTFγ and S3/NICD derivatives are dependent on PS1 expression and inhibited by a γ-secretase inhibitor. Unexpectedly, the APP-CTFγ derivative produced in these reactions is generated by endoproteolytic processing at a site several amino acids carboxyl-terminal to the scissile sites for production of Aβ peptides but interestingly, occurs at a site immediately proximal to the analogous site for production of S3/NICD. Although the relationship of APP-CTFγ to the production of Aβ peptides is not known, we conclude that in contrast to the highly selective PS-dependent proteolysis of the Notch TM domain, the PS-dependent γ-secretase processing of APP is largely nonselective and occurs at multiple sites within the APP TM domain.

To assess the role for PS1 in the production of an APP carboxyl-terminal derivative, termed APP-CTFγ, that would be generated following intramembranous proteolysis by γ-secretase, we performed Western blot analysis of detergent lysates from PS1-deficient fibroblasts transiently cotransfected with cDNA encoding APPmyc and either wild type PS1 or a PS1 aspartate variant (D385A) that has been shown to reduce Aβ secretion (27Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar, 28Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). As expected, upon transfection of APPmyc cDNA, ∼12-kDa CTFmycα and ∼14-kDa CTFmycβ appear that are significantly elevated over the ∼10-kDa endogenous CTFα seen in untransfected cells (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). On the other hand, coexpression of human wild type PS1 with APPmyc reduces the levels of these ∼12- and ∼14-kDa CTFmyc species, commensurate with the accumulation of a novel ∼7-kDa CTFmyc species, which we propose is CTFmycγ (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). In support of this notion, coexpression of the D385A PS1 variant and APPmyc restores the levels of accumulated CTFmycα and CTFmycβ species seen in APPmyc-transfected cells and most importantly, eliminates the production of the CTFmycγ (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). We confirmed these findings by showing that expression of APPmyc does not lead to appreciable levels of secreted Aβ but that coexpression of wild type PS1 restores Aβ secretion (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2′ and 3′). Moreover, the PS1 D385A variant inhibits Aβ production, as expected (Fig. 1 A, lane 4′). These results in transient transfection analyses were fully confirmed in biosynthetically labeled N2a cell lines that stably coexpress APPmyc and either wild type PS1 (WT.7) or the PS1 D385A variant (D385A.16). Pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine for 15 min and immunoprecipitation analysis of detergent lysates using antibody 369 revealed identical synthetic levels of APP in both lines and low but detectable levels of ∼12- and ∼14-kDa CTFmyc species (Fig.1 B, lanes 1 and 2); intracellular Aβ peptides are not detected at this time point (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1′ and 2′). After 45 min of chase, we observed increased levels of ∼12-kDa CTFmycα and ∼14-kDa CTFmycβ species and an ∼7-kDa CTFmycγ species in lysates of WT.7 line (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). In contrast, we observed very high levels of CTFmycα and CTFmycβ species in lysates of cells expressing the D385A PS1 variant (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). However, the level of ∼7-kDa CTFmycγ in cells expressing the D385A PS1 variant was markedly lower than the levels observed in cells expressing wild type PS1 (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Indeed, the levels of Aβ both in cell lysates and in the conditioned medium from cells expressing the D385A variant were substantially reduced compared with those from cells expressing wild type PS1 (see Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 3′ and 4′ and lanes 3“ and 4”; Aβ secretion is not detectable at the end of the pulse-labeling period). To develop a biochemically tractable system to examine γ-secretase processing of Notch and APP, we isolated membrane fractions from PS1±fibroblasts that express the Notch-green fluorescent protein chimera and examined EDTA-induced γ-secretase processing (Fig.2 A). We show that incubation of these membranes at 37 °C led to the production of the S3/NICD fragment (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1 and 2) and that this reaction was inhibited by addition of the γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 to 100 nm (Fig. 2 A,lane 3). In parallel, we assessed the production of a previously described ∼6-kDa CTFγ derived from γ-secretase cleavage of endogenous ∼10-kDa CTFα (29McLendon C. Xin T. Ziani-Cherif C. Murphy M.P. Findlay K.A. Lewis P.A. Pinnix I. Sambamurti K. Wang R. Fauq A. Golde T.E. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2383-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 30Pinnix I. Musunuru U. Tun H. Sridharan A.

We detected the CTFγ only after incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1 and 2), and this reaction was also inhibited by addition of the γ-secretase inhibitor (Fig.2 B, lane 3). In titration experiments using varying concentrations of L-685,458, we have demonstrated that the in vitro generation of S3/NICD and APP-CTFγ are equally sensitive to the inhibitor with an IC50 of ∼50 pm, 2T. I. and S. S. S., submitted for publication. findings that suggest that these derivatives are generated by similar, if not identical, γ-secretase activities. As the levels of endogenous APP-CTFγ generated in the fibroblasts were extremely low, we chose to analyze the CTFγ fragment generated in membranes from a cell line (N2aWT.11) that stably expresses APPmyc and wild type PS1. Incubation of membranes at 37 °C for 60 min from N2aWT.11 cells leads to unchanged levels of full-length APP but a diminution in levels of the ∼12- and ∼14-kDa CTFmyc derivatives. Commensurate with reduction in levels of these CTFmyc species was the appearance of an ∼7-kDa CTFmycγ derivative, similar to the PS1-dependent CTFmycγ fragment observed in living cells (Fig.3 A, lanes 1 and 2; see Fig. 1 B). With the assumption that the CTFmycγ fragment might be extruded into the cytoplasmic compartment in a manner similar to the S3/NICD fragment of Notch, we prepared membrane and soluble fractions. The ∼12- and ∼14-kDa CTFmyc fragments were membrane-bound prior to, or after, incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 4), and as expected, the CTFmycγ fragment was found exclusively in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). To establish the identity of the CTFmycγ fragment in the soluble fraction, we immunoprecipitated the peptide with CT15 and subjected recovered material to MALDI-TOF MS (Fig. 3 C). We observed principal peptides of mr 7341.3 and 7110.4, which includes the mass of the 12-amino acid myc epitope tag; the prominent mr 7341.3 peptide is generated by endoproteolytic cleavage between Leu-645 and Val-646 (of APP695), whereas the mr 7110.4 peptide is generated by cleavage between Met-647 and Leu-648 (Fig.3 C). A series of genetic and pharmacological approaches have revealed that PS are required for γ-secretase processing of Notch1 and APP (31Selkoe D.J. Wolfe M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5690-5692Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the case of Notch1, a membrane-tethered S2/NEXT is subject to processing by γ-secretase, leading to the generation of a cytoplasmic fragment, S3/NICD (4Selkoe D.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). APP is processed by α- and β-secretases to generate a set of membrane-tethered CTFs, and these derivatives are subsequently processed by γ-secretase to generate a spectrum of secreted Aβ peptides (see below). However, the residual CTFγ resulting from γ-secretase processing of the CTFα and -β, has been elusive. Very recently, McLendon et al. (29McLendon C. Xin T. Ziani-Cherif C. Murphy M.P. Findlay K.A. Lewis P.A. Pinnix I. Sambamurti K. Wang R. Fauq A. Golde T.E. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2383-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and Pinnix et al. (30Pinnix I. Musunuru U. Tun H. Sridharan A. Golde T. Eckman C. Ziani-Cherif C. Onstead L. Sambamurti K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 481-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) reported on the generation of a CTFγ derivative in isolated membranes from brain or cultured cells. This derivative was not biochemically characterized, but its production was inhibited by high concentrations of pepstatin A, MG132, and a substrate-based difluoroketone (30Pinnix I. Musunuru U.

To these latter observations, the present report offers several novel insights relevant to γ-secretase processing of the Notch S2/NEXT and the APP-CTFs. First, we document that a peptide corresponding to APP-CTFγ can be detected in lysates of transfected cells and that the production of this derivative is dependent on PS1 expression and largely eliminated by expression of the dominant negative D385A PS1 variant. Second, we establish that both the APP-CTFγ and S3/NICD can be generated in cytosol-free membranes and that the production of these derivatives is inhibited by a γ-secretase inhibitor. Third, and most surprising, is our demonstration using MALDI-TOF MS that the prominent in vitro-derived APP-CTFγ is generated by proteolysis between the 21st (Leu-645) and 22nd (Val-646) amino acids of the 24-amino acid APP TM domain. Notably, the P1′ Val-646 is one residue more carboxyl-terminal to the P1′ Val that is necessary for Notch processing (5Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Our studies are consistent with recent results from Sastre et al. (32Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO J. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref Scopus (426) Google Scholar) and Gu et al. (33Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35235-35238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Having established the identity of CTFγ, we are now faced with the conundrum that the processing sites for generation of this CTF are distinct from the scissile sites for Aβ40 or Aβ42 peptides, which occur between the 12th (Val-636) and 13th (Ile-637) or 14th (Ala-638) and 15th (Thr-639) amino acids, respectively. Taken together with our present data showing that CTFγ production is dependent on PS1 expression, and inhibited by a selective γ-secretase inhibitor that also blocks production of Aβ, we offer three mechanistic scenarios. The first of these is that CTFγ is derived by secondary endoproteolysis of the CTF57 or CTF59 derivatives that are the residual fragments from proteolysis at the scissile bonds that generate Aβ. We consider this unlikely, as we have detected neither the CTF57 nor CTF59 derivatives in in vivo pulse-chase studies nor in kinetic studies in cytosol-free membrane preparations. The second possibility is that proteolysis between Leu-645 and Val-646 is obligatory for subsequent endo- or exoproteolytic activity events necessary for generating Aβ40/42 peptides. This notion can be tested by assessing CTFγ and Aβ production in cells expressing APP variants with mutations surrounding the scissile site. In this regard, and in view of the finding that a V1744G substitution at the P1′ site in the Notch blocks NICD production and Notch activity (34Huppert S.S. Le A. Schroeter E.H. Mumm J.S. Saxena M.T. Milner L.A. Kopan R. Nature. 2000; 405: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), Sastre et al. (32Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO J. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref Scopus (426) Google Scholar) have recently examined CTFγ production in membranes prepared from cells expressing APP with a V646G substitution. Surprisingly, the production of CTFγ was unimpaired. Clearly, a more rigorous mutational analysis is required before a conclusion can be drawn about the relationship between the generation of CTFγ and Aβ production. The third alternative is that proteolysis giving rise to Aβ does not require prior generation of the CTFγ or vice versa. In this scenario, the membrane-tethered APP-CTFs are randomly processed at multiple sites. In view of the multiplicity of Aβ-related peptides with termini at 34, 37, 38, 39, 42, and 43 that are invariably detected (19Murphy M.P. Hickman L.J. Eckman C.B. Uljon S.N. Wang R. Golde T.E. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and the demonstration that extensive mutagenesis of the APP TM domain have little effect on the production of Aβ-related peptides (19Murphy M.P.

A. 1999; 96: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), we would argue that the PS-dependent γ-secretase activity is largely nonselective. We would offer the proposal that the APP TM domain is subject to processing by a presently unidentified membrane-resident, multicatalytic protease similar to the proteosome. We envision that the function of this protease would be to introduce nicks in TM segments of many membrane proteins, resulting in slippage of the residual TM segments into either the cytoplasmic or lumenal space wherein the entire domain is subject to the proteolytic activities resident within those compartments. In this vein, it is equally conceivable that regulated forms of this protease class would be responsible for generating cytosolic fragments that play critical roles in nuclear signaling events (35Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration of a potential nuclear signaling role for the cytoplasmic domain of APP (36Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar) underscores the importance of understanding the mechanisms responsible for intramembranous processing of APP. Despite the differences in the precise sites of proteolysis and sequence requirements within the APP and Notch TM domains, we have shown that L-685,458 is an equally potent inhibitor of the reaction(s) that generate Notch S3/NICD and CTFγ (see Ref. 21Martys-Zage J.L. Kim S.H. Berechid B. Bingham S.J. Chu S. Sklar J. Nye J. Sisodia S.S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar and this study).2 These data would imply that if γ-secretase is a single entity, it must be highly unusual. In this regard, it is not clear how expression of PS1 harboring a D257A substitution is still capable of generating Aβ but fails to generate Notch S3/NICD (28Capell A. Steiner H. Romig H. Keck S. Baader M. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Haass C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of FAD-linked L166P PS1 variant or the experimental L286E or L286R PS1 mutants leads to overproduction of Aβ42 but fails to generate S3/NICD (37Kulic L. Walter J. Multhaup G.

Finally, recent studies have revealed that processing of APP and Notch1 can be discriminated by a JLK family of non-peptidic inhibitors (38Petit A. Bihel F. Alves da Costa C. Pourquie O. Checler F. Kraus J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These inhibitors block Aβ production but have very little, if any, effect on production of S3/NICD (38Petit A. Bihel F. Alves da Costa C. Pourquie O. Checler F. Kraus J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Collectively, these experiments prove unequivocally that γ-secretase processing of APP and Notch can be dissociated, leading us to conclude that the catalytic activities responsible for processing these substrates are not one in the same. Thus, whereas PS are critical for regulating γ-secretase activities, it is our view that these polypeptides are unlikely to be the sole effectors of intramembranous proteolysis of APP and Notch1. In the final analysis, it will be critical to develop in vitroreconstitution systems with purified components to establish the role(s) of PS and their interacting components in facilitating γ-secretase processing of APP and Notch1.

Upon exposure to a stress, the factor is activated and binds to so-called heat shock element (HSE) sequences in promoters of genes encoding heat shock proteins (Hsp), enhancing expression of these genes. Activation is reversible, and during recovery from the stress the factor is returned to its unactivated form. The HSF1 polypeptide contains an HSE DNA-binding domain near its amino terminus. Further inside lie two closely spaced hydrophobic repeats (LZ1 and LZ2), and a third hydrophobic repeat (LZ3) is located near the carboxyl terminus. In unstressed human cells, human HSF1 (hHSF1) polypeptide is in a dynamic complex with Hsp90 or, possibly, an Hsp90-containing multichaperone complex (5Ali A. Bharadwaj S. O'Carroll R. Ovsenek N.

Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). When the cells are exposed to heat or a chemical stressor, protein unfolding increases, and non-native proteins begin to accumulate (7Lepock J.R. Frey H.E. Rodahl A.M. Kruuv J. J. Cell.

These non-native proteins are believed to compete with hHSF1 for binding Hsp90, resulting in an increase in unbound hHSF1 molecules. Unbound hHSF1 polypeptides homotrimerize rapidly in a reaction thought to be driven largely by hydrophobic interactions between LZ1 repeat sequences (3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Exposure of cells to certain chemicals such as salicylate, menadione, or hydrogen peroxide and overexpression of HSF1 from transfected genes result in the appearance of DNA binding and nuclear-localized but transcriptionally inactive HSF1 trimers (reviewed in Ref. 2Voellmy R. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B.S. Stress-Inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1996: 121-137Crossref Google Scholar). These observations suggest that HSF1 activation is at least a two-step process involving a DNA binding but transcriptionally inactive HSF1 trimer as an intermediate. Little is known about the mechanisms that affect the conversion of inactive HSF1 trimer to active transcription factor, except that transcriptional activity of HSF1 is correlated with hyperphosphorylation of the factor (10Cotto J.J. Kline M. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3355-3358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 11Xia W. Voellmy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4094-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a region in the hHSF1 sequence, the so-called regulatory domain, was identified that mediates repression of nonadjacent activation domains (12Green M. Schuetz T.J. Sullivan E.K. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3354-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Even less is known about the mechanism that returns active HSF1 to its unactivated form during recovery from a stressful event. Because trimeric HSF1 is thermodynamically stable, dissociation of factor trimers is probably an active, chaperone-mediated process. The present study provides evidence for the proposition that the transcriptional activity of trimeric hHSF1 is repressed, to a degree that depends on the intracellular concentration of stress-denatured proteins, by multichaperone complexes of the Hsp90-immunophilin-p23 type. These multichaperone complexes can associate with hHSF1 subsequent to the dissociation of the initial hHSF1 complex and formation of factor homotrimers. The complexes exert their repressing effect by binding to the hHSF1 regulatory domain. This repression mechanism may ensure the proportionality of hHSF1 activation and transcription of hsp genes in response to a stress. Association of trimeric hHSF1 and multichaperone complexes may also represent the first step of the process that returns hHSF1 to its unactivated state during recovery from a stressful event. It was previously reported that Hsp90-containing complexes can be assembled on recombinant hHSF1 forms and that trimeric HSF1 of Xenopusassociates with Hsp90-containing complexes, in particular Hsp90-immunophilin-p23 complexes (5Ali A.

Welch W.J. Voellmy R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). For transfection, 60-mm dishes containing 1.3 × 106 cells were incubated overnight in 3 ml of complete medium. 2–3 μg of DNA/dish were used, including 0.5 μg of reporter gene construct and expression constructs and/or vector DNA to keep total DNA amounts constant. Typically, cells were exposed to DNA-LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) complexes for 3 h and incubated further in fresh medium for 18–24 h prior to harvest or treatment. Heat treatments were carried out in a 43 °C water bath for 30 min. 80% confluent cells in 150-mm dishes were washed twice with PBS and then exposed for 2 min at room temperature to 2 mm dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) (DSP; Pierce). Heat-treated cells were washed with prewarmed (43 °C) PBS prior to cross-linking with DSP at 43 °C. Following exposure to DSP, the cells were washed once with PBS containing 10 mm glycine and once with cold PBS and were then harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and Complete protease inhibitors; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of extracts were determined using the protein assay reagent of Bio-Rad and were equalized prior to further analysis. For most immunoprecipitation experiments, PBS-washed cell pellets were resuspended in cold RIPA buffer and incubated on ice for about 1 h. Cell debris was then removed from cell lysates by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation of His-hGR, His-cBSA, and His-β-Gal complexes, cells were resuspended in HEM buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 20 mm sodium molybdate) on ice and lysed by three cycles of rapid freezing (dry ice-ethanol bath) and thawing (37 °C water bath). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For the preparation of cell extract for native gel electrophoresis, PBS-washed cells were resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.42m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, Complete protease inhibitors, 25% glycerol) and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. Debris was removed as described before. Protein concentrations of extracts were determined and equalized as before. Typically, aliquots of extracts (0.5–1 mg of protein in 0.4–0.6 ml) were incubated for 1 h with 30 μg of antibody at 4 °C. Incubation was continued for another 3 h after addition of 50 μl of a slurry of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized by boiling for 5 min in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 15% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% bromphenol blue), a step that also served to reverse chemical cross-linking. Anti-hHSF1 antiserum and mouse monoclonal antibodies against Hsp90 (9D2), Hsp70 (C92F3A), Hsc70 (1B5), and FKBP52 (KN382/EC1) were from StressGen Biotechnologies, PP5 antiserum from Michael Chinkers (University of South Alabama College of Medicine), p50Cdc37 antiserum from Nick Grammatikakis (Tufts University), p50Cdc37 affinity-purified antibody from Dr. J. Wade Harper (Baylor College of Medicine), and CyP40 antiserum from Affinity Bioreagents. FLAG monoclonal antibody M5, anti-FLAG (M2) resin, nonimmune rabbit serum, and control mouse monoclonal antibody (UPC-10) were from Sigma; His tag monoclonal antibody and luciferase antiserum were fromCLONTECH; and His tag resin (BabCO) and actin (N350) monoclonal antibody were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. FKBP52 antibody KN382/EC1 was used for Western blots, and UPJ56 (from the Pratt laboratory) was used for immunoprecipitations. For the preparation of bacterially expressed hHSF1, a full-length hHSF1-coding sequence was subcloned into vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Glutathione-hHSF1 fusion protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified on glutathione beads (glutathione-Sepharose 4B from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Full-length hHSF1 was released by incubation with bovine thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Biotinylated HSE oligonucleotide 5′-GCCTCGAATGTTCGCGAAGTTTCGAAAAAAAAA-biotin-3′ (0.15 mm) was annealed with unbiotinylated complementary oligonucleotide (0.6 mm) in TK buffer (0.1 mTris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m KCl). 0.1 ml of this solution and 10 μl of neutravidin beads (Pierce) were incubated (under rotation) for 1 h at room temperature, and HSE DNA beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed four times with 1 ml of TK buffer. Recombinant hHSF1 (3 μg in 0.3 ml of buffer H: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to the beads, the suspension was incubated for 45 min at 4 °C, and hHSF1 beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed four times with buffer H, and resuspended in 0.25 ml of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Green Hectare, Oregon, WI) containing an ATP-regenerating system (10 mm phosphocreatine (Sigma), 3.5 units creatine phosphokinase (type I, rabbit muscle; Sigma)). After 10 min of incubation (under rotation) at room temperature (25 °C), 0.2 mm geldanamycin, 10 units/ml apyrase (grade VIII, potato, from Sigma) or vehicle were added, and incubation was continued for 20 min. The beads were washed rapidly four times with 1 ml of ice-cold TTG buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mmmonothioglycerol, 0.1% Tween 20), and associated proteins were released by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blot. Western blots, native anti-hHSF1 immunoblots, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out essentially as described in Zuo et al. (15Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 16Zuo J. Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For HSE and LexA oligonucleotide probes see Zuo et al. (15Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Antibody complexes were detected on immunoblots by chemiluminescence using SuperSignal West Pico or Fento substrate solution (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activities were measured using a Luciferase Assay System Freezer-1 Pack kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). All luciferase activities reported in the figures are relative specific activities. To identify Hsps and cochaperones associating with hHSF1 prior to and subsequent to the initiation of an activating heat treatment, cultures of a human HeLa cell line that had been either heat-treated at 43 °C for 15 min or left untreated were exposed to cross-linking reagent DSP. Extracts were prepared, and the aliquots containing comparable amounts of protein were reacted with antibodies against Hsp90, Hsp/c70, Hop, Hip, p23, CyP40, p50Cdc37, FKBP52, or FKBP51. Immune complexes were isolated and, following reversal of cross-linking, examined for the presence of hHSF1 by anti-hHSF1 Western blot. Under the conditions tested, only Hsp90 and FKBP52 antibodies were able to coimmunoprecipitate hHSF1. Coimmunoprecipitation of hHSF1 was strictly dependent on prior cross-linking. Other interactions were not detected either because antibodies capable of precipitating complexes were not available or the relatively stringent conditions (RIPA buffer) used to ensure specificity interfered with antigen-antibody interactions. Confirming earlier observations (5Ali A. Bharadwaj S. O'Carroll R. Ovsenek N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4949-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 6Zou J. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar), hHSF1 was found to be already associated with Hsp90 in unstressed cells (Fig.1 A, upper panels). Because trimeric hHSF1 was virtually undetectable in unstressed cells (see the native anti-hHSF1 blot in Fig. 1 B), Hsp90 most likely had formed a complex with nontrimeric hHSF1. After 15 min of heat treatment virtually all hHSF1 had homotrimerized (Fig.1 B), and the abundance of the hHSF1-Hsp90 interaction had decreased to a lower level (Fig. 1 A, upper panels). FKBP52 was not found associated with hHSF1 in cells that had not been heat-treated (Fig. 1 A, lower panels). However, an interaction between FKBP52 and hHSF1 was readily detected in heat-treated cells. These results strongly suggested that FKBP52 interacted in vivo with trimeric but not with nontrimeric hHSF1. Because FKBP52 was known to bind to target proteins as part of an Hsp90-containing complex and the hHSF1-Hsp90 interaction was still observed after 15 min of heat treatment,i.e. at a time when virtually all hHSF1 was trimeric, it appeared reasonable to infer that trimeric hHSF1 had associated with an Hsp90- and FKBP52-containing multichaperone complex. Note that the intensity of the Western blot signals produced by coimmunoprecipitated hHSF1 was a complex function of the avidity of the coprecipitating antibody, the effectiveness with which the antibody precipitated its antigen when the latter was part of a protein complex, the effects of RIPA buffer and the presence of cross-links on the antibody-antigen interaction, the efficiency of cross-linking, etc. Hence, the hHSF1 signals reflected relative concentrations of protein interactions during hHSF1 activation but did not contain information about the stoichiometry of protein complexes, in particular multiprotein complexes. Consequently, the observation of a substantial difference between the amounts of hHSF1 coimmunoprecipitated using Hsp90 and FKBP52 antibodies from cells heat-treated for 15 min did not suggest that less than stoichiometric amounts of Hsp90 and FKBP52 associated with hHSF1 under this condition or that a larger fraction of hHSF1 was bound by FKBP52 than by Hsp90. After 15 min of incubation at 43 °C, a majority of hHSF1 molecules were hyperphosphorylated as judged from their decreased mobility (11Xia W. Voellmy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4094-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A, top panel). A time course experiment revealed that hHSF1-FKBP52 interactions began to form as early as 1 min after initiation of the heat treatment (Fig. 1 C), whereas hyperphosphorylation of hHSF1 could not be detected until after about 5 min. Thus, the chaperone complex was capable of interacting with both hyperphosphorylated and nonhyperphosphorylated hHSF1. Because non-native proteins preferentially associate with chaperones and chaperone complexes, it was conceivable that the observed interactions in heat-treated cells involved heat-denatured hHSF1. That hHSF1 could be coimmunoprecipated from extracts prepared from cells exposed to other inducers of the heat shock response such as sodium arsenite and azetidine carboxylate (18Fowden L. Richmond M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 71: 459-461Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 19Fowden L. Lewis D. Tristram H. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1967; 29: 89-163PubMed Google Scholar) appeared to rule out this possibility (Fig. 1, D–F). Thus, the interaction of hHSF1 and the Hsp90- and FKBP52-containing complex formed as a consequence of stress-induced trimerization of hHSF1. In vitro reconstitution experiments were carried out to obtain a more complete description of Hsp90- and immunophilin-containing complexes associating with trimeric hHSF1. Note that complexes of this type were known to also include a loosely bound p23 molecule (20Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Full-length recombinant hHSF1 was prepared as described under “Materials and Methods.” To ensure that only trimeric hHSF1 complexes were analyzed, advantage was taken of the fact that only trimeric hHSF1 specifically binds to HSE DNA (3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Complexes were reconstituted in rabbit reticulocyte lysate on recombinant trimeric hHSF1 bound to HSE DNA sequences that were immobilized on beads. Western blot analysis revealed that the bona fidetrimeric hHSF1 associated with components of Hsp90-immunophilin-p23 complexes, Hsp90, p23, CyP40, FKBP52, FKBP51, and immunophilin substituent PP5 (Fig. 2). Assembly of Hsp90-containing multichaperone complexes including p23 and an immunophilin was known to require ATP and to be inhibited by Hsp90-binding compound geldanamycin (21Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Nair S.C. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). That incubation with geldanamycin and apyrase prevented the association of immunophilins and p23 with the hHSF1 beads indicated that these proteins bound trimeric hHSF1 as part of Hsp90-immunophilin-p23 complexes. Note that in the experiments described below the model is tested and evidence is presented that binding of Hsp90-immunophilin-p23 complex to trimeric hHSF1 represses the transcriptional activity of the factor. Hence, the trimeric hHSF1 complexes that were observed to form during activation of the transcription factor in the experiment shown in Fig.1 (A and B) were not intermediates of activation but rather represented the fraction of hHSF1 that was retained in a transcriptionally inactive state under the chosen condition of intermediate heat stress. Note further that the prediction that the concentration of trimeric hHSF1 complexes accumulating should be inversely proportional to the intensity of the activating heat treatment may not be readily tested because of confounding effects of heat denaturation of hHSF1 expected to occur under conditions of extreme heat stress. Like any other non-native protein, heat-denatured hHSF1 will enter a pathway of refolding or elimination, in the normal course of which it will associate with chaperones (22Bose S. Weikl T. Bugl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 23Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 24Thulasiraman V. Matts R.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13443-13450Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It was previously observed that a large fraction of hHSF1 accumulated as homotrimers in cells overexpressing the factor from transfected genes in the absence of stress (15Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These hHSF1 homotrimers had HSE DNA binding activity but only minimal transcriptional activity when compared with that produced by heat shock or a deregulated hHSF1 mutant (15Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A chimeric transcription factor, LexA-hHSF1 (“LexA-hHSF1”), was constructed by replacing the first 78 hHSF1 residues comprising the HSE DNA-binding domain with an 87-residue region containing the DNA-binding domain of bacterial repressor LexA (16Zuo J. Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because of this substitution, the chimeric factor bound LexA-binding sites instead of HSE sequences. Overexpressed LexA-hHSF1 also accumulated as (LexA) DNA-binding but transcriptionally inactive trimers that could be activated by heat treatment (15Zuo J. Rungger D. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4319-4330Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Note that in many of the experiments presented below LexA-hHSF1 was expressed instead of hHSF1 to avoid confounding the effects of endogenous hHSF1 activity. We hypothesized that in cells overexpressing the factor, trimeric hHSF1 was retained in a repressed state by a bound Hsp90-immunophilin (FKBP52)-p23 complex. To determine whether trimeric hHSF1 was indeed associated with such a chaperone complex, cell cultures were transfected with an hHSF1 expression construct and, 1 day later, subjected to chemical cross-linking with DSP. Copious quantities of (trimeric) hHSF1 complexes could be coimmunoprecipitated using Hsp90 and FKBP52 antibodies (Fig.3 A). The hHSF1 complexes were sufficiently abundant that readily detectable amounts could be recovered even without prior stabilization by cross-linking (Fig.3 A). Similar results were obtained for overexpressed, chimeric factor LexA-hHSF1 (Fig. 3 B). When taken together with the results of the in vitro reconstitution experiments, these findings strongly suggested that, in cells overexpressing the factor, inactive, trimeric hHSF1 (or LexA-hHSF1) was bound by an Hsp90-immunophilin (FKBP52)-p23 complex. The following experiments provided additional evidence that latter complexes included trimeric hHSF1. As mentioned before, hHSF1 acquires specific HSE DNA binding activity as a consequence of its trimerization (3Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 25Westwood J.T. Clos J. Wu C. Nature. 1991; 353: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In the experiment in Fig. 3 C, proteins dissociated from complexes that had been immune-isolated from extracts of hHSF1-overexpressing cells using FKBP52 antibody were found to have specific HSE DNA binding activity. Very little DNA-binding signal was detected when proteins recovered from immunoprecipitations using a control antibody were similarly assayed. No signal was produced by proteins coprecipitated using FKBP52 antibody from extracts of naı̈ve cells (not shown). In the experiment in Fig. 3 D, an hHSF1 mutant unable to trimerize efficiently was overexpressed (16Zuo J. Baler R. Dahl G. Voellmy R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7557-7568Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This mutant displayed a much reduced ability to interact with FKBP52. Note that whereas Hsp90 interacts with both trimeric and nontrimeric hHSF1 forms (Fig. 1), the presence of FKBP52 in hHSF1 complexes specifically identifies trimeric hHSF1 complexes. Because this study focuses on trimeric hHSF1 complexes, only coimmunoprecipitations using FKBP52 antibody are shown hereinafter. If binding of an Hsp90-immunophilin (FKBP52)-p23 complex repressed the transactivation function of overexpressed, trimeric hHSF1, coexpression of a protein that associated with the same type of chaperone complex or part of the machinery that assembles the complex could be expected to result in reduced binding of the chaperone complex to hHSF1 and in increased activity of the transcription factor. Steroid hormone receptors were known to be stabilized by a bound Hsp90-immunophilin-p23 complex (including either FKBP52 or another immunophilin) that is released upon activation by hormone ligand (20Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Overexpression of different steroid hormone receptors was previously found to result in activation of an hsp promoter-driven reporter gene in the absence but not in the presence of the hormone ligand (26Xiao N. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1365-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Parallel cultures were cotransfected with an expression construct for LexA-hHSF1, a luciferase reporter gene responsive to activated LexA-hHSF1 (LexA-Luc) as well as different amounts of"

The aaRSs can be divided into two classes, class I and class II, comprising 10 members each, which have distinct catalytic domain architectures with exclusive signature motifs for the ATP binding (1Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). The class I aaRSs have a catalytic domain constructed with the Rossmann fold, and display two signature amino acid motifs “HIGH” and “KMSKS.” The Rossmann fold has a β6α4 topology and is apparently divided into two symmetrical halves (β3α2 topology each), which are believed to have evolved by a genetic event such as gene duplication. The class I aaRSs are further divided into three subclasses (class Ia, Ib, and Ic) on the basis of the sequence homology and the domain architectures (2Cusack S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The class Ia aaRSs consist of the isoleucyl-, methionyl-, valyl-, leucyl-, cysteinyl-, and arginyl-tRNA synthetases (IleRS, MetRS, ValRS, LeuRS, CysRS, and ArgRS, respectively); the class Ib aaRSs include the glutamyl- and glutaminyl-tRNA synthetases GluRS and GlnRS, respectively, and the class Ic aaRSs are the tyrosyl- and tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases (TyrRS and TrpRS, respectively). In general, an aa-AMP analogue potently inhibits the corresponding aaRSs from eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. In contrast, some antibiotics inhibit only the eubacterial (and archaeal) aaRSs, but not the eukaryotic enzymes. The best known example is mupirocin, which targets bacterial and archaeal IleRSs (6Hughes J. Mellows G. Biochem. J. 1978; 176: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 7Hughes J. Mellows G. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mupirocin (the chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1) is produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens NCIB 10586 (4Fuller A.T. Mellows G. Woolford M. Banks G.T. Barrow K.D. Chain E.B. Nature. 1971; 234: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and has been clinically used as an antibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (5Sutherland R. Boon R.J. Griffin K.E. Masters P.J. Slocombe B. White A.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the eubacterial IleRSs are apparently different from those of the eukaryotic and archaeal IleRSs in their C-terminal domains (8Sassanfar M. Kranz J.E. Gallant P. Schimmel P. Shiba K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9995-10003Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no significant difference in the amino acid sequence has been shown in the catalytic domains of the IleRSs from the three primary kingdoms. Therefore, it is suggested that mupirocin may discriminate the fine structural differences between the substrate-binding sites of the bacterial/archaeal IleRSs and the eukaryotic IleRSs. Although the peptide protection from trypsin digestion suggested that mupirocin acts as an analogue of isoleucyl-adenylate (Ile-AMP, its chemical structure is shown in Fig. 1) (13Yanagisawa T. Lee J.T. Wu H.C. Kawakami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24304-24309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the chemical structure of mupirocin is significantly different from that of Ile-AMP (Fig. 1) (14Chain E.B. Mellows G. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1977; 3: 294-309Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, the precise mechanism by which mupirocin acts against IleRS remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, a highly mupirocin-resistant, methicillin-resistant S. aureus was found, which harbors a new plasmid-borne, eukaryotic-type IleRS (type-II IleRS) (8Sassanfar M. Kranz J.E. Gallant P. Schimmel P. Shiba K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9995-10003Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Rahman M. Noble W.C. Cookson B.

Therefore, it is clinically important to design new drugs for the resistant bacteria. We present the crystal structures of the Thermus thermophilus IleRS in complexes with Ile-AMS (Fig. 1), an analogue of Ile-AMP, and with mupirocin (Fig. 1). The present structure provides a structural basis for the mechanisms of the IleRS recognition of Ile-AMP and mupirocin and the inhibition by the antibiotic. The recombinant T. thermophilusIleRS was purified as described by Nureki et al. (3Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Crystals of the IleRS·Ile-AMS complex were prepared by soaking the IleRS crystals in a harvesting buffer containing 0.1 mmIle-AMS. Crystals of the IleRS·mupirocin complex were obtained by cocrystallization of 20 mg·ml−1 IleRS and 1 mm mupirocin under the conditions reported previously (3Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Diffraction data of crystals of the IleRS·Ile-AMS complex and the IleRS·mupirocin complex were collected at room temperature to 3.0- and 2.5-Å resolutions, respectively, with a Weissenberg camera for macromolecules installed on the beam line 6A2 at the Photon Factory in KEK (Tsukuba, Japan). All data were processed with the DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The initial phases were calculated by molecular replacement with the program AMORE (16CCP4. Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The Ile-AMS and mupirocin molecules were unambiguously identified in the F o − F c omit maps. Crystallographic positional and slow-cooling refinements were carried out with the Crystallography & NMR System (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. GrosseKunstleve R.W.

The stereochemical parameters of the final model were analyzed by the program PROCHECK (19Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Morris A.L. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

T. thermophilus tRNAIle was prepared by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase. The aminoacylation was carried out at 65 °C in a reaction containing 100 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm KCl, 100 μml-[14C]isoleucine, 5 μmtRNAIle, and 30 nm wild type IleRS or 300 nm mutant IleRS. The inhibition constantK i, of mupirocin with respect to isoleucine, and theK m values for isoleucine were obtained from Dixon plots and Lineweaver-Burk plots, respectively. For the kinetic analyses, the concentration ranges of l-isoleucine and mupirocin were 60–480 μm and 0–4 μm, respectively. Ile-AMS (5′-N-[N-(l-isoleucyl)sulfamoyl]adenosine) is a non-hydrolyzable analogue of Ile-AMP, in which the phosphoester bond between the isoleucyl and adenosine moieties is replaced with a sulfoamide bond (Fig. 1). Ile-AMS strongly inhibits all of the IleRSs from eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (data not shown). The IC50 value against the T. thermophilus IleRS was 5.6 nm. We prepared the crystals of the complex of IleRS and Ile-AMS by a soaking experiment. However, we could only obtain the crystals with a low concentration of Ile-AMS (0.1 mm), which led to the low occupancy of Ile-AMS (50%). Nevertheless, we could unambiguously identify the Ile-AMS molecule in the F o −F c omit map (Fig. 2 a). In the present structure, the Ile-AMS molecule is tightly bound to the bottom of the catalytic cleft of the Rossmann fold domain of T. thermophilus IleRS (Fig. 2 b). The side chain of the isoleucyl moiety is recognized by a hydrophobic pocket consisting of Pro-46, Trp-518, and Trp-558 through van der Waals interactions (Fig. 2 c). The amino group of the isoleucyl moiety hydrogen-bonds to the main chain carbonyl group of Pro-46 (Fig. 2, c andd). The Nε of the side chain of Gln-554 hydrogen-bonds to the carbonyl group of the isoleucyl moiety (Fig. 2, c andd). This recognition manner of the isoleucyl moiety of Ile-AMS is the same as that of l-isoleucine (3Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), except that the amino group hydrogen-bonds to the Oδ of Asp-85 in place of the main chain carbonyl group of Pro-46 in the IleRS·l-isoleucine complex (3Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The Nε of His-57, the second His of the class I-specific signature motif,54HIGH57, hydrogen-bonds to one of the oxygens of the sulfamoyl group (Fig. 2, c and d). The imidazole ring of His-581 provides van der Waals interactions with the ribose moiety (Fig. 2 c). The 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribose moiety hydrogen-bonds to the main chain amide of Gly-551 (Fig. 2,c and d). Furthermore, the Oδ of Asp-553 and the Oε of Glu-550 hydrogen bond to the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups, respectively (Fig. 2, c and d). The N3 group of the adenine moiety is recognized by the Nε of His-581 through hydrogen bonding (Fig. 2, c and d). The adenine is further recognized by the side chain of Leu-583 through a van der Waals interaction (Fig. 2, c and d). To date, in the class I aaRSs, the crystal structures ofT. thermophilus LeuRS (20Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), Bacillus stearothermophilus TyrRS (Fig. 3 d) (21Bhat T.N. Blow D.M. Brick P. Nyborg J. J. Mol.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 218-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have already been reported, as both free forms and complexes with their cognate aminoacyl-adenylates. Furthermore, the crystal structures of T. thermophilus ValRS (Fig. 3 b) (25Fukai S. Nureki O. Sekine S. Shimada A. Tao J.S. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2000; 103: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and Escherichia coli GlnRS (Fig. 3 c) (26Rath V.L. Silvian L.F. Beijer B. Sproat B.S. Steitz T.A. Structure. 1998; 6: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were reported in complexes with aminoacyl-adenylates. To elucidate the general recognition mechanism of the aminoacyl-adenylate, we compared the present structure of the IleRS·Ile-AMS complex with these adenylate complexes of the other class I aaRSs. The result is summarized in Fig. 3 e. In the class Ia and Ib aaRSs, the amino group of the aminoacyl moiety hydrogen-bonds to the main chain carbonyl group of the residue (Pro-46 in T. thermophilus IleRS) located at the C terminus of the first β-strand of the Rossmann fold (Fig. 3, a–e). Furthermore, in ValRS, LeuRS (20Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and GlnRS, the amino group of the aminoacyl moiety hydrogen-bonds to the Oδ of the aspartate residue corresponding to Asp-85 of T. thermophilus IleRS, which resides at the C terminus of the second β-strand of the Rossmann fold and is highly conserved in most of the class Ia and Ib aaRSs (Fig. 3,b and c, and e and f). In contrast, whereas the Oδ of Asp-85 hydrogen-bonds to the amino group in the IleRS· l-isoleucine complex (3Nureki O. Vassylyev D.G. Tateno M. Shimada A. Nakama T. Fukai S. Konno M. Hendrickson T.L. Schimmel P. Yokoyama S. Science. 1998; 280: 578-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), the carboxyl group is now far from the amino group in the complex with Ile-AMS. Both of the two residues are located in the first symmetrical half of the Rossmann fold. On the other hand, in the class Ic aaRSs, the side chain of the aminoacyl moiety rotates by almost 180° around the C–Cα bond as compared with the class Ia and Ib aaRSs, and the amino group hydrogen bonds to the side chains of the residues located in the second symmetrical half of the Rossmann fold (Fig. 4 d). In the class Ia and Ib aaRSs, the carbonyl group of the aminoacyl moiety is directed toward the second half of the Rossmann fold (Fig. 3, a–c). In LeuRS, the carbonyl oxygen is recognized with a hydrogen bond by the Nε of the invariant His residue (corresponding to Gln-554 of T. thermophilus IleRS) located in the fourth α-helix of the Rossmann fold (20Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In contrast, in ValRS and GlnRS, the corresponding residues are well conserved hydrophobic residues, which cannot hydrogen-bond to the carbonyl oxygen (Fig. 3, b, c, andf). In these cases, the carbonyl oxygen of aa-AMP is not recognized by any residue of the aaRSs. In TrpRS, the carbonyl group of the aminoacyl moiety is directed toward the second half of the Rossmann fold as well, but is not recognized by any residue. Except for IleRS, the main chain amide of the residue located on the loop following the first β-strand of the Rossmann fold (Thr-48 of T. thermophilus IleRS) hydrogen-bonds to one of the oxygens of the phosphate group (Fig. 3,b–f). In IleRS and ValRS, the phosphate oxygen is further recognized through hydrogen bonding by the Nε of the second His (His-57 of T. thermophilus IleRS) of the class I-specific signature motif, HIGH (Fig. 3, a, b, and f). On the other hand, in GlnRS and TrpRS (23Doublie S. Bricogne G. Gilmore C. Carter Jr., C.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 17-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 24Ilyin V.A. Temple B. Hu M. Li G. Yin Y. Vachette P. Carter Jr., C.W. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 218-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the phosphate oxygen hydrogen-bonds to the Nζ of the second Lys (Lys-594 of T. thermophilus IleRS) of the class I-specific signature motif, KMSKS (Fig. 3, c and f). The 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribose moiety is recognized through hydrogen bonding by the main chain amide of Gly (Gly-551 of T. thermophilus IleRS), which is located at the C terminus of the fourth β-strand of the Rossmann fold and is conserved in most of the class I aaRSs. Furthermore, the carboxyl group of the acidic residue (Asp-553 of T. thermophilus IleRS), located at the N terminus of the fourth α-helix of the Rossmann fold, hydrogen-bonds to the 2′-hydroxy group (Fig. 3, a-d). In contrast, in GlnRS, the residue corresponding to Asp-553 of T. thermophilus IleRS is not involved in the interaction with the ribose (Fig. 3, c and f), but instead, the 2′-hydroxyl group hydrogen-bonds to the side chain of the invariant Thr, which corresponds to Gly-551 of T. thermophilus (Fig. 3, c and f). In IleRS and ValRS, the side chain of the residue corresponding to Glu-550 of T. thermophilus IleRS, on the fourth β-strand of the Rossmann fold, is involved in hydrogen-bonding to the 3′-hydroxyl group of the ribose (Fig. 3, a, b, andf). In contrast, in LeuRS, GlnRS, TyrRS, and TrpRS (23Doublie S. Bricogne G. Gilmore C. Carter Jr., C.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 17-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 24Ilyin V.A. Temple B. Hu M. Li G. Yin Y. Vachette P. Carter Jr., C.W. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 218-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the residue corresponding to Glu-550 of T. thermophilusIleRS is replaced by a hydrophobic residue (Fig. 3, c andd, and f). Consequently, in these aaRSs, the 3′-hydroxyl group is not recognized by any residue (Fig. 4,c and d). In the class Ic aaRSs, the O-4′ of the ribose moiety hydrogen-bonds to the second His (His-57 of T. thermophilus IleRS) of the class I-specific signature motif, HIGH (Fig. 3, d andf). However, in the class Ia and Ib aaRSs, the O-4′ of the ribose moiety is not recognized by any residue of the aaRSs (Fig. 3,a–c). Except for IleRS and TyrRS, the main chain amide of the residue corresponding to Ile-584 of the T. thermophilus IleRS, in the “stem contact fold” domain, hydrogen-bonds to N-1 of adenine (Fig. 3, b, c, e, andf). Furthermore, in these aaRSs, the N-6 of adenine hydrogen-bonds to the main chain carbonyl oxygen of the same residue and, in ValRS, LeuRS, and TrpRS, to the carbonyl oxygen of the Met residue (Met-592 of T. thermophilus IleRS) of the class I-specific signature motif, KMSKS (Fig. 3, b, c, e, andf). In contrast, in TyrRS, there is no hydrogen bonding interaction between the N-6 group and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of any residue (Fig. 3 d). In the present crystal structure of the IleRS·Ile-AMS complex, the distance between the N-6 atom and the carbonyl oxygen of Met-592 is too far to allow hydrogen bond formation (6.05 Å). Therefore, movement of the loop bearing Met-592 is required for the interaction, as discussed below. In IleRS, ValRS, and LeuRS (20Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the side chain of the His residue (His-581 of T. thermophilus IleRS), at the C terminus of the last β-sheet, hydrogen-bonds to the N-3 atom of adenine (Fig. 3, a, b, andf). In GlnRS, the N-7 of adenine hydrogen-bonds to the Nη of the Arg corresponding to Leu-583 of the T. thermophilusIleRS (Fig. 3, c and f). In TyrRS, the adenine moiety is not recognized by a hydrogen bonding interaction with the enzyme (Fig. 3 d). In LeuRS and TrpRS, structural comparisons of the free forms and the complexes with the aminoacyl-adenylate revealed that the loop bearing the KMSKS motif moves toward the inside of the catalytic cleft of the Rossmann fold upon aa-AMP binding (20Cusack S. Yaremchuk A. Tukalo M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 23Doublie S. Bricogne G. Gilmore C. Carter Jr., C.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 17-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 24Ilyin V.A. Temple B. Hu M. Li G. Yin Y. Vachette P. Carter Jr., C.W. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 218-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Actually, in the ValRS and GlnRS complexes, the loop bearing the KMSKS motif is located within the catalytic cleft of the Rossmann fold (Fig. 3, b andc). Consequently, in these four aaRSs, the KMSKS motif can interact with the adenine or the phosphate group of their cognate aa-AMP (Fig. 3, b and c). This “induced fit” may reconfigure the residues involved in the ATP recognition and stabilize the transition state for amino acid activation (27Fersht A.R. Knill-Jones J.W. Bedouelle H. Winter G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1581-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the structures of IleRS and TyrRS complexed with the aminoacyl-adenylate, the KMSKS loop still adopts the open conformation (Fig. 4, a and d). In these two aaRSs, the catalytic loop itself is involved in the crystal packing. Consequently, the signature loop may hardly move toward the amino acid-binding site, in keeping with the crystal packing. Actually, for the T. thermophilus IleRS, a high concentration of Ile-AMS led to cracking of the crystals, which can be ascribed to the movement of the signature loop. On the other hand, a low concentration of Ile-AMS may not cause the movement of the signature loop, thus resulting in the low occupancy of Ile-AMS in the active site. Therefore, further structural studies on the cocrystals of IleRS or TyrRS and aa-AMP are required. Our kinetic analysis revealed that a mupirocin moderately inhibits the T. thermophilus IleRS, with an IC50 value of 0.9 μm. In the present structure, the mupirocin molecule snugly binds to the catalytic cleft of the Rossmann fold domain of theT. thermophilus IleRS, like the Ile-AMS molecule (Fig. 4,a and b). The moiety that morphologically resembles the hydrophobic side chain ofl-isoleucine (C-12 to C-14 and C-17) is recognized by the isoleucine-specific pocket, consisting of Pro-46, Trp-518, and Trp-558, through van der Waals interactions. However, the direction of the moiety is different from that of the side chain of Ile-AMS orl-isoleucine (Fig. 4 c). This difference may come from the hydroxyl group attached to C-13, which is specific to mupirocin, and from the structural difference between the short epoxy group of mupirocin and the long sulfamoyl group of Ile-/AMS (Figs. 2 c and 4 c). The pyran hexa-ring stacks with the imidazole ring of His-581 (Fig. 4 c). The main chain amide group of Gly-551 hydrogen-bonds to the hydroxyl groups attached to C-6 (Fig. 4, c andd). Furthermore, the C-6-attached hydroxyl group in turn hydrogen-bonds to the Oδ of Asp-553, and the C-7-attached hydroxyl group hydrogen-bonds to the Oε of Glu-550 (Fig. 4, c andd). Therefore, the hydroxyl groups of the pyran ring are recognized in the same way as those of the ribose moiety of Ile-AMS (Figs. 2 c and 4 c). The conjugated system at C-1 to C-3 interacts with the side chain of Leu-583 through van der Waals interactions (Fig. 4 c). The main chain amide of Ile-584 hydrogen-bonds to the carbonyl oxygen attached to C-1 (Fig. 4, c and d). This interaction mimics the interaction between the main chain amide of Ile-584 and the N-1 of the adenine moiety of Ile-AMS. Therefore, the conjugated system at C-1 to C-3 of mupirocin functionally mimics the adenine ring of Ile-AMP (Figs. 2 c and 4 c). Consequently, we can conclude here that mupirocin blocks the binding site of Ile-AMP, the high energy intermediate of the aminoacylation reaction. The 9-hydroxynonanoic acid encompassing C-1′ to C-9′ of mupirocin lies along the catalytic loop bearing the class I signature motif, 591KMSKS595, and interacts with the side chain and the main chain of Met-592 (Fig. 4 c). The present complex structure is consistent with the previous biochemical experiment, which revealed that mupirocin protects the KMSKS catalytic loop of E. coli IleRS from trypsin digestion (13Yanagisawa T. Lee J.T. Wu H.C. Kawakami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24304-24309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of S. aureus IleRS complexed with E. coli tRNAIle and mupirocin, the carboxylate tail of mupirocin binds to the carbonyl oxygen of Ser-597, the first Ser of the class I-specific signature motif, KMSKS, corresponding to Ser-593 ofT. thermophilus IleRS (28Silvian L.F. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1074-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). This difference in the binding manner of mupirocin may be ascribed to the fact that the KMSKS loop of the S. aureus IleRS adopts a closed conformation, in contrast to the open conformation in the T. thermophilusIleRS complex. The nonanoic acid moiety of mupirocin is characteristic of the antibiotic, in contrast to the other moieties that mimic Ile-AMP. It has already been reported that when the conjugated system and the nonanoic acid moiety are replaced by proper chemical groups that maintain both the electrostatic potential and the unoccupied molecular orbital features, the inhibitory activities do not change (29Brown P. Best D.J. Broom N.J. Cassels R. O'Hanlon P.J. Mitchell T.J. Osborne N.F. Wilson J.M. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 2563-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The present crystal structure of the IleRS·mupirocin complex suggests that the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen attached to C-1 and the main chain amide group of Ile-584 mainly contribute to the electrostatic potential and that the interaction between the C-1 to C-3-conjugated system and the side chains of Leu-583 mainly contribute to the unoccupied molecular orbital. Therefore, it can be postulated that the long chain of the nonanoic acid moiety is not likely to be essential for the inhibitory activity. On the other hand, as already discussed, the binding of ATP or an aminoacyl-adenylate may induce the movement of the KMSKS signature loop to the inside of the catalytic cleft of the Rossmann fold. However, when mupirocin binds to the IleRS, the nonanoic acid moiety is located beside the signature loop, where it would fix its conformation to the open form and prevent the signature loop from accessing the active site. In contrast to the IleRS·Ile-AMS complex, where the signature loop has an open conformation by the crystal packing force, the nonanoic acid moiety of mupirocin might substantially stabilize the open conformation of the loop by the molecular interaction. Therefore, this may be an additional inhibitory mechanism of mupirocin. As described, the bacterial IleRSs apparently differ from the archaeal and eukaryotic IleRSs in their C-terminal domain and the C-terminal zinc finger structure (8Sassanfar M. Kranz J.E. Gallant P. Schimmel P. Shiba K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9995-10003Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Rossmann fold domain, to which binds mupirocin and Ile-AMS, plays a crucial role in the aminoacylation reaction, and therefore, the amino acid sequences in the Rossmann fold domain are highly conserved throughout the IleRSs from the three primary kingdoms. Nevertheless, mupirocin inhibits only bacterial and archeal IleRSs but not eukaryotic IleRSs (7Hughes J. Mellows G. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This suggests that some amino acid residues that recognize mupirocin, but are not crucial for the Ile-AMP recognition, should differ between the bacterial/archaeal and eukaryotic IleRSs. Considering that the IC50 value of mupirocin against the T. thermophilus IleRS is between those against the bacterial and eukaryotic IleRSs, the active site of theT. thermophilus IleRS is composed of bacterial/archaeal type residues and eukaryotic type residues. By combining the present structure and the sequence alignment, we could identify two amino acid residues that directly recognize mupirocin but are not conserved between the IleRSs from bacteria/archaea and eukaryotes. First, His-581, located at the C terminus of the last β-sheet of the Rossmann fold, is conserved in the bacterial/archaeal IleRSs but is replaced with an asparagine or serine in the eukaryotic IleRSs (Fig. 4 e). In the present complex structure, His-581 hydrophobically interacts with the pyran ring, and the Nε of His-581 also hydrogen bonds to the N-3 group of Ile-AMS. The replacement of the His residue with Asn or Ser might considerably weaken the hydrophobic interaction with the pyran ring of mupirocin or the ribose of Ile-AMS while not affecting the interaction with the adenine base of Ile-AMS. In the S. aureus plasmid-encoded IleRS (type-II), the His residue is replaced with Leu, and therefore, the hydrophobic interactions with the pyran ring moiety may be slightly weaker, but the hydrogen bond with the N-3 group of the adenine moiety may disappear. Second, Leu-583 in the T. thermophilus IleRS, which was mentioned above to be involved only in the interaction with mupirocin (13Yanagisawa T. Lee J.T. Wu H.C. Kawakami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24304-24309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is replaced with Phe in the bacterial/archaeal IleRSs and with Ile in the eukaryotic IleRSs (Fig. 4 d). In the present structure, Leu-583 makes stacking interactions with the conjugated system of mupirocin. Therefore, when the Leu residue is replaced with Phe, the stacking interaction may become stronger. In theS. aureus type-II IleRS, the corresponding position is occupied by His, which may extensively interact with mupirocin. To confirm that the variations of the above-discussed amino acid residues in the Rossmann fold domain actually lead to the differences in the inhibitory activity by mupirocin, we constructed two types of mutant IleRSs. The eukaryotic type of mutant IleRS has double mutations, with substitutions of Thr-48 and His-581 for Phe and Asn, respectively. The S. aureus (type II) mutant IleRS has double mutations, with substitutions of His-581 and Leu-583 for Leu and His, respectively. We prepared the two types of mutants and measured the mupirocin inhibition of the IleRSs (Table II). The aminoacylation activities of the two mutants were not substantially reduced; the K mvalues for l-isoleucine of the wild type, the eukaryotic type mutant, and the S. aureus (type II) mutant were 52.8, 56.4, and 118 μm, respectively. For the wild type IleRS, the K i value of mupirocin with respect tol-isoleucine was 0.25 μm, whereas that for the eukaryotic type mutant was 2.73 μm, which is 1 order of magnitude greater than the wild type. Furthermore, in the S. aureus (type-II) mutant, the K i of mupirocin was 2.31 μm, which is also 1 order of magnitude greater than the wild type. These results suggest that the replacements of the residues that vary between the bacterial/archaeal and eukaryotic IleRSs significantly change the sensitivity to a mupirocin. Here it should be noticed that, although the S. aureus type II IleRS is quite similar to the T. thermophilus IleRS (37.8% identity), only the exchange of the positions of only two amino acid residues altered the sensitivity to mupirocin by 1 order of magnitude, which is comparable with the eukaryotic type mutant. Conversely, it is now clinically critical to design a new drug that specifically inhibits theS. aureus type II IleRS, on the basis of the present complex structure and the biochemical information.Table IIKi values of mupirocin versus l-isoleucine and Km values of l-isoleucineK iK mμmT. thermophilus HB8 wild type0.2552.8Eukaryote-type mutant2.7356.4S. aureus II-type mutant2.31118E. coli B2.5 × 10−311.1P. fluorescens NCIB 10586 (IleS)2.5ND2-aNot determined.S. aureus60 × 10−31.1S. cerevisiae15162-a Not determined.

To address these issues a TIMP-2-free cell line derived from a Timp2−/− mouse was transfected for stable cell surface expression of hMT2-MMP. Untransfected cells did not activate endogenous or exogenous TIMP-2-free MMP-2 unless both TIMP-2 and concanavalin A (ConA) were added. Transfected cells expressing hMT2-MMP efficiently activated both endogenous and exogenous MMP-2 (within 4 h) via the 68-kDa intermediate in the absence of TIMP-2 and ConA. In contrast, activation of MMP-2 by Timp2−/− cells expressing recombinant hMT1-MMP occurred more slowly (12 h) and required the addition of 0.3–27 nm TIMP-2. Addition of TIMP-2 or TIMP-4 did not enhance MMP-2 activation by MT2-MMP at any concentration tested; furthermore, activation was inhibited by both TIMPs at concentrations >9 nm, consistent with the similar association rate constants (k on) calculated for the binding of TIMP-4 and TIMP-2 to MT2-MMP (3.56 × 105m−1 s−1 and 6.52 × 105m−1 s−1, respectively). MT2-MMP-mediated activation involved cell surface association of the MMP-2 in a hemopexin carboxyl-terminal domain (C domain)-dependent manner: Exogenous MMP-2 hemopexin C domain blocked activation, and cells expressing hMT2-MMP did not bind or activate a truncated form of MMP-2 lacking the hemopexin C domain. These studies demonstrate the existence of an alternative TIMP-2-independent pathway for MMP-2 activation involving MT2-MMP, which may be important in mediating MMP-2 activation in specific tissues or pathologies where MT2-MMP is expressed.

Although many proteinases are involved, members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP1) family and in particular MMP-2 (gelatinase A, EC 3.4.24.24), play a pivotal role in these events. MMPs are a group of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that in vitro have the potential to degrade proteins of the extracellular matrix (1Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3827) Google Scholar), although in vivoevidence for this is limited.

Real time PCR was performed (10 s at 94 °C, 60 s at 60 °C for 40 cycles of amplification) on an Applied Biosystems Amp 5700 Sequence Detection System using specific primers pairs for: hMT2-MMP (sense 5′-TGGTGGCAGTGCATGAGC-3′; antisense 5′-GGCAGCTTGAAGTTGTCAACG-3′) and (sense 5′-GTCCTGGACAACTATCCCATGC-3′; antisense 5-CGCTTCTCGAAAGAGCCAGTAG-3′); hMT1-MMP (sense 5′-GCCTACCGACAAGATTGATGC-3′; antisense 5′-CACTGCCCTGAGCTCTTCG-3′) and (sense 5′-GAGGAAGGATGGCAAATTCG-3′; antisense 5-GCATCAATCTTGTCGGTAGGC-3′); murine and hMT1-MMP (sense 5′- ACGGGAACTTTGACACCGTG-3′; antisense 5-TTATTCCTCACCCGCGAG-3′); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (sense 5′-GTATGACTCCACTCACGGCAAA-3′; antisense 5′-CCATTCTCGGCCTTGACTGT-3′). 30-μl reactions contained: 1 μl of RT reaction, 400 nm of each set of specific sense and antisense primers as appropriate, 15 μl of Sybergreen PCR mix (Applied Biosystems), and 5% Me2SO. Standard curves were generated using 103-108 copies of plasmids containing cDNA of hMT1-MMP or hMT2-MMP, and results were normalized for RNA input using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Samples and standards were analyzed in triplicate for each set of primers for MT1-MMP and MT2-MMP cDNAs, and control reactions without RT were analyzed in duplicate. For immunocytochemical studies, untransfected and transfected Timp2−/− cells were seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well onto eight-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek). Cells were cultured for 24 h, washed in PBS, and incubated in serum-free DMEM with or without 20 μg/ml ConA. After 24-h incubation, the medium was removed and cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and washed four times in PBS. The fixed cultures were incubated overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (TBS-BSA) and 10% normal goat serum (Molecular Probes). Designated wells were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml mouse monoclonal antibody against hMT1-MMP (MAB918) (R & D Systems, Inc.), 2.5 μg/ml rabbit polyclonal antibody against MT1-MMP (AB815) (Chemicon), 20 μg/ml mouse monoclonal antibody against MT2-MMP (MAB3220) (Chemicon), 2.5 μg/ml affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies that we raised against the following peptide sequences in hMT2-MMP, 285DVDNFKLPEDDLRG298,341GGKPERPPKPG351, and461EETQRGDPGYPK472, using methods described before (21Overall C.M.

Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG antiserum (Molecular Probes) diluted in TBS-BSA to 1%, was added to appropriate samples. Secondary antibodies were highly pre-absorbed against other species' IgG by the supplier and further screened in our laboratory, in pilot experiments, to verify lack of nonspecific binding to cultured cells as described (21Overall C.M.

The cells were washed four times in TBS and incubated in 10 μm Hoechst 33342 in TBS for 10 min, then washed again four times in TBS. The chambers were disassembled, and coverslips were applied to the slides over 10% (w/v) 1,4-diazobicyclo-2,2-octane (Sigma) in 90% glycerol/10% PBS. Preparations were viewed using a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope with Plan-Neofluar objectives and standard filters for Texas Red and Hoechst, respectively. High resolution monochrome images were collected on a charge-coupled device camera and processed using a Northern Eclipse software package. Exposure times for antibody-stained, non-immune control and no primary antibody control incubations were standardized at identical exposure times to obtain representative control images. Images were colorized with Photoshop 5.0 using identical settings. Human TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and baby hamster kidney cells, respectively, and purified as described in Bigg et al. (28Bigg H.F. Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. Wang Z. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3610-3618PubMed Google Scholar). TIMP-2-free human pro-MMP-2 was expressed in Timp2−/− cells using the pGW1GH expression vector as described (28Bigg H.F. Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. Wang Z. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M.

Overall, unpublished data. To introduce a stop codon, two bases were mutated in pGW1GH/hMMP-2 at base positions 1252 and 1253 (TCT to TGA) in the MMP-2 cDNA. MMP-2ΔCD cDNA was then fully sequenced, and pGW1GH/hMMP-2ΔC was transfected into CHO cells as described for the Timp2−/− cells. Clones expressing MMP-2ΔCD (M r = 46,000) were identified by zymography and expanded under selection. MMP-2 hemopexin C domain was expressed in E. coli and purified as described (21Overall C.M.

Untransfected Ras/Myc-transformedTimp2−/− cells and cells transfected with vector, hMT2-MMP, or hMT1-MMP were seeded into 96-microwell or 6-well tissue culture plates at 2.5 × 104 or 5 × 105 cells per well, respectively. After 24 h the cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated serum-free in DMEM containing recombinant TIMP-2-free pro-MMP-2 (final concentration 5 nm) or MMP-2ΔCD (final concentration 5 nm) or with conditioned serum-free medium from ROS 17/2.8 cells containing pro-MMP-2 and TIMP-2. Cell supernatants were harvested after 24 h and for some experiments cell monolayers were detached by pipetting up and down in PBS, washed thoroughly with PBS (3 × 1.5 ml), and lysed in 0.2% Zwittergent (Calbiochem). Cell extracts and supernatants were analyzed by zymography. For activation of MMP-2 in the presence of TIMP-2 and TIMP-4, between 0 and 81 nmTIMP-2 or TIMP-4 was added in serum-free DMEM containing 5 nm recombinant TIMP-2-free pro-MMP-2. In other experiments, cells were treated with 20 μg/ml ConA in serum-free DMEM containing 5 nm recombinant TIMP-2-free pro-MMP-2 and incubated for 24 h. In MMP-2 hemopexin C domain competition experiments, cells were incubated with 50 μl of serum-free DMEM containing 1–5000 nm hemopexin C domain (0.1- to 500-fold molar ratio of hemopexin C domain to pro-MMP-2 final concentration) for 2 h, followed by the addition of 50 μl of DMEM containing 10 nm recombinant TIMP-2-free pro-MMP-2. For ConA and hemopexin C domain competition experiments, cells expressing hMT1-MMP and the vector control cells were also incubated in the presence of 3 nm TIMP-2 Samples were electrophoresed under non-reducing conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels co-polymerized with 1 mg/ml gelatin. Zymograms were incubated in TBS with 5 mmCaCl2 at 37 °C for 4–24 h before staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. To measure the association rate constant (k on) of MT2-MMP and TIMP-4, the concentration of the hMT2-MMP catalytic domain was assessed by active site titration against TIMP-2 of known concentration. MT2-MMP activity was measured in fluorometry assay buffer (0.1 mTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35) at 25 °C using 1 μmof the general MMP-quenched fluorescent peptide substrate (7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-[3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-2,3-diaminoproprionyl]-Ala-Arg-NH2(48Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). 10 nm MT2-MMP was inhibited by similar concentrations of TIMP-2 and TIMP-4, and the k on was calculated from curves fitted to the data using a slow tight binding equation (Method 2 (49Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J. Cockett M.I. O'Shea M. Brocklehurst K. Phillips I.R. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4330-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar)). To estimate the overall inhibition constant, MT2-MMP (350 pm to 2.8 nm) was incubated in fluorometry assay buffer with a range of concentrations of TIMP-1, TIMP-2, or TIMP-4 (up to 765 nm) for at least 2 h at 37 °C in a 96-well fluorescence assay plate. Remaining activity was measured at 37 °C using 1 μm quenched fluorescent peptide in a Fmax fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices) with a 320-nm excitation and 405-nm emission filter pair. Data were fitted to a tight binding equation (see Ref. 19Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D. Docherty A.J. Biochem.

Within a group of structurally related compounds that differ in transfection capacity, we have investigated the role of the shape and structure of the pyridinium molecule on the stability of bilayers formed from a given SAINT and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) and on the polymorphism of SAINT/DOPE-DNA complexes. Using electron microscopy and small angle x-ray scattering, a relationship was established between the structure, stability, and morphology of the lipoplexes and their transfection efficiency. The structure with the lowest ratio of the cross-sectional area occupied by polar over hydrophobic domains (SAINT-2) formed the most unstable bilayers when mixed with DOPE and tended to convert into the hexagonal structure. In SAINT-2-containing lipoplexes, a hexagonal topology was apparent, provided that DOPE was present and complex assembly occurred in 150 mm NaCl. If not, a lamellar phase was obtained, as for lipoplexes prepared from geometrically more balanced SAINT structures. The hexagonal topology strongly promotes transfection efficiency, whereas a strongly reduced activity is seen for complexes displaying the lamellar topology. We conclude that in the DOPE-containing complexes the molecular shape and the nonbilayer preferences of the cationic lipid control the topology of the lipoplex and thereby the transfection efficiency.

However, their lower gene transfer efficiency when compared with viral vectors and their low stability in the presence of serum thus far frustrate their use for in vivo application. To overcome these difficulties, new formulations are engineered with the aim of better defining the structure, enhancing stability, reducing poly-dispersity and size, and improving DNA compaction (7Blessing T.

Equally crucial in these developments is the need for a better understanding of the structure-function relationship of cationic lipid-based gene delivery systems. Although several studies, in vitro(10Balasubramaniam R.P. Bennett M.J. Aberle A.M. Malone J.G. Nantz M.H. Malone R.W. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 163-172PubMed Google Scholar, 11Byk G. Dubertret C.

Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 764-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have been carried out with that aim, a coherent and comprehensive interpretation is often difficult, because of a comparison of different classes of cationic lipids within one study and the use of different cell lines. This is particularly relevant when taking into account that even within a group of structurally related compounds within one class, a small change in the structure may lead to dramatic changes in their biological activity (15Van der Woude I. Wagenaar A. Meekel A. ter Beest M.B. Ruiters M.H. Engberts J.B.F.N. Hoekstra D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1160-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus a variety of structural models have been proposed based upon electron microscopy studies, including a DNA encapsulation model (16Gershon H. Ghirlando R. Guttman S.B. Minsky A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), spaghetti and meatball structures (17Sternberg B. Sorgi F.L. Huang L.

Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). By using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS)1 and synchrotron x-ray diffraction, important new insight has been obtained into the structural organization of cationic lipid-DNA complexes. Thus, depending on the absence or presence of the helper lipid dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), either a lamellar or a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice (HII) organization, respectively, was obtained (22Radler J.O. Koltover I. Salditt T. Safinya C.R. Science. 1997; 275: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, 23Koltover I. Salditt T. Radler J.O. Safinya C.R. Science. 1998; 281: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). The phase preference of the lipoplex for a lamellar or hexagonal phase not only depends on the use of helper lipid as such but also on the chemical nature of the helper lipid (e.g. DOPEversus dioleoylphophatidylcholine; Refs. 24Farhood H. Serbina N. Huang L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1235: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar and 25Hui S.W. Langner M. Zhao Y. Ross P. Hurley E. Chan K. Biophys.

For example, within a group of cationic lipids that perform well in the absence of co-lipid, like diocatadecylamidoglycylspermine-4-trifluoroacetic acid and bis-guanidinium-tren-cholesterol and lipopolyamines, hexagonal structures (26Labat-Moleur F.

Oudrhiri N. Vigneron J.P. Hauchecorne M. Aguerre O. Toury R. Airiau M. Ramasawmy R. Scherman D. Crouzet J. Leh J.-M. Leh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have been observed. On the other hand, the effect of DOPE on the ultimate structure of the complex seems to depend on the class of cationic lipid. For example, bis-guanidinium-tren-cholesterol/DOPE-DNA complexes exhibited lamellar symmetry (27Pitard B. Oudrhiri N. Vigneron J.P. Hauchecorne M. Aguerre O. Toury R. Airiau M. Ramasawmy R.

Acta. 1996; 1284: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas DOTAP/DOPE-DNA complexes form an inverted hexagonal organization (23Koltover I. Salditt T. Radler J.O. Safinya C.R. Science. 1998; 281: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). The differences between these two morphologies have been attributed to differences in the charge of the two cationic lipids, differences in hydrophobic moiety, and the concentration of DOPE used in the formulations (27Pitard B. Oudrhiri N. Vigneron J.P. Hauchecorne M. Aguerre O. Toury R. Airiau M. Ramasawmy R. Scherman D. Crouzet J. Leh J.-M. Leh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2621-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Within a group of related DOTAP analogs, the length of the hydrophobic tails determined the tendency of the DOTAP/DOPE bilayer to form the hexagonal phase (31Regelin A.E. Fankhaenel S. Gurtesch L. Prinz C. von Kiedrowski G. Massing U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although a correlation has been shown between the inverted hexagonal packing of DOTAP/DOPE-DNA lipoplex and rapid fusion with anionic vesicles followed by DNA dissociation (23Koltover I. Salditt T. Radler J.O. Safinya C.R. Science. 1998; 281: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar), direct insight into the structure-function relationship of lipoplex-mediated transfection is very poor. The purpose of the current study was to obtain such insight by using one particular class of cationic pyridinium-derived lipids, abbreviated as SAINTs (13Meekel, A. A., Wagenaar, A., S̆misterová, J., Kroeze, J. E., Haadsma, P., Bosgraaf, B., Stuart, M. C. A., Brisson, A., Ruiters, M. H. J., Hoekstra, D., and Engberts, J. B. F. N. (2000) Eur. J. Org.

The effect of the overall shape of the amphiphiles on the colloidal stability of the bilayers formed with DOPE (1:1) and the impact of this stability/instability on the polymorphism of SAINT/DOPE-DNA complexes within a group of structurally highly related compounds, although differing in their ability to deliver DNA into COS-7 cells, was investigated by electron microscopy, by small angle x-ray scattering, and in transfection studies. DOPE was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Pyridinium amphiphiles, abbreviated as SAINT, were synthesized and characterized as previously described (18Huebner S. Battersby B.J. Grimm R. Cevc G. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 3158-3166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of the highest grade. A solution of SAINT, either alone or in 1:1 molar ratio with DOPE in chloroform or methanol, was taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. Any residual solvent was removed under vacuum. The lipid film was hydrated at room temperature in water at a final lipid concentration of 1 mm and sonicated to clarity in a bath sonicator (G112SPIT, 600 V) immediately before use. 50 nmol of SAINT/DOPE (1:1, unless indicated otherwise) liposomes were complexed with 3.3 μg of pCMV β-gal plasmid in a final volume of 200 μl of HBS (10 mmHEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). The turbidity was measured in a 96-well microtiter plate at 550 nm for different time intervals by spectrophotometry (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT). A small drop of the lipid or lipoplex suspension was deposited on a glow discharged holey carbon-coated grid. After blotting away the excess of lipid, the grids were plunged in liquid ethane. Frozen hydrated specimen were mounted in a GatAn (model 626) CRYO-STAGE and examined in a Philips CM 120 cryo electron microscope operating at 120 kV. SAXS measurements were performed at 25 °C using a NanoStar device (Bruker AXS and Anton Paar) with a ceramic fine-focus x-ray tube operated in a point focus mode. The tube was powered with a Kristalloflex K760 generator at 35 kV and 40 mA. The primary beam was collimated using cross-coupled Göbel mirrors and a 0.1-mm pinhole providing a CuKαradiation beam (the wavelength λ = 0.154 nm) with a full-width at half-maximum about 0.2 mm in diameter at the sample position. A sample-detector distance of 0.24 m was chosen, because no new reflections were observed at longer distances. The use of a Hi-Star position-sensitive area detector (Siemens AXS) allowed the recording of the scattering intensity in the q range of 0.5–8.5 nm−1. The scattering vector q is defined as q=4πλsinθ2Equation 1 where λ is the wavelength and θ is the scattering angle. The measurements of the samples, prepared by mixing SAINT/DOPE liposomes (1:1, 750 nmol) and pCMV β-gal solution (50 μg, the charge ratio 2.5:1), were performed in flame sealed quartz capillaries with a diameter of 1 mm. After flame sealing, the samples were centrifuged at low speed and left for 2–3 days at room temperature to equilibrate. The measuring time was between 3 and 9 h. A 7.1-kilobase plasmid containing the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase gene under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene promoter (pCMV β-gal CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used as the reporter gene. DNA was isolated from E. coli using a Qiagen plasmid kit. The plasmid concentration was determined by measuring the absorption at 260 nm using the relation 1.0 A = 50 μg/ml. Typically, theA 260/A 280 value was 1.95. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 7% of fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml of streptomycin at 37 °C in CO2/air (1:19). The cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were seeded in 12-well plates and allowed to grow overnight. Lipoplexes consisting of SAINT/DOPE (1:1) with pCMV β-gal were prepared at a charge (±) ratio 2.5:1 (15 nmol of lipid and 1 μg of DNA), unless indicated otherwise, in 100 μl 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. After 10–15 min of incubation at room temperature, the lipoplex was diluted in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 0.5 ml of the mixture was added to the cells, which was followed by an incubation for 4 h at 37 °C. The β-gal assay was performed 48 h later, using chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The purpose of this work was to investigate the structure/function relationship of cationic lipid-mediated gene delivery. To this end, one class of such lipids was selected, the so-called SAINT amphiphiles, which are pyridinium-based amphiphiles with two symmetric alkyl chains (Fig. 1). SAINT-2 and SAINT-21 only differ in their head group region, the latter containing an “extended” trimethyl ammonium charge, whereas both amphiphiles contain the same di-C18:1 (oleyl-monounsaturated, 85:15cis/trans) alkyl chains. Instead of two C18:1 alkyl chains, SAINT-27 contains two palmityl chains (C16:0) and an additional positive charge in the head group region, provided by the C4 spacer-attached amine group. The effect of the different structural features of the various SAINT derivatives on their transfection ability when mixed with an equimolar amount of DOPE is shown in Fig. 2. The transfection efficiency of all three cationic SAINT lipids was found to be optimal at a +/− charge ratio of approx. 2.5 (data not shown and Ref. 15Van der Woude I. Wagenaar A. Meekel A. ter Beest M.B. Ruiters M.H. Engberts J.B.F.N. Hoekstra D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1160-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The replacement of C18:1 chains by the saturated palmityl alkyl chains in SAINT-27 and the presence of an additional positive charge in the form of a protonated amine group resulted in a lowering of the transfection activity to about 35% of that obtained for SAINT-2/DOPE (1:1). Unexpectedly, the introduction of the (charged) trimethylammonium group in the SAINT-2 skeleton, defined as SAINT-21, virtually abolished transfection activity. DOPE is a common helper lipid that usually improves transfection efficiency. Interestingly, when compared with the results obtained in the absence of DOPE, the activity of SAINT-2 increased ∼4–5-fold when lipoplexes were prepared with 50 mol % DOPE. By contrast, the activity of both SAINT-21 and SAINT-27 turned out to be DOPE-independent. To clarify the underlying mechanisms that dictated these remarkable DOPE-dependent differences in SAINT-mediated transfection efficiency and the superior transfection efficiency of SAINT-2 containing lipoplexes, the colloidal and structural properties of the various cationic liposomes and lipoplexes were investigated. In water, all three SAINT derivatives, when mixed with an equimolar amount of DOPE, formed vesicles with diameters in the range of 100–200 nm, as determined by cryo-TEM (Fig. 3 A). However, when exposed to physiological salt concentrations, the colloidal stability of the SAINT/DOPE (1:1) vesicles was dependent on the SAINT structure. Liposomes, prepared from SAINT-21/DOPE and SAINT-27/DOPE in water, maintained their vesicular appearance after dilution in HBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), and single aqueous compartments bounded by a unilamellar membrane were visualized by cryo-TEM (Fig. 3 A). However, the transfer of SAINT-2/DOPE liposomes into HBS buffer resulted in an apparent disintegration of the vesicular structure, leading to the formation of particles with a typical electron-dense fingerprint structure within their lumen, as shown in Fig. 3 B, which is thought to originate from the formation of nonbilayer structures. Indeed, structural analysis of these particles by SAXS (Fig. 3 C) revealed the ability of SAINT-2/DOPE (1:1) liposomes to undergo a transition from a lamellar (in water) to the hexagonal phase after addition of 150 mmNaCl, with diffraction maxima at q = 1.01, 1.76, and 2.02, and a periodicity of 7.2 nm. Next we verified how these colloidal and structural features were affected upon lipoplex assembly. To determine the stability of SAINT/DOPE bilayers following their interaction with DNA upon assembly of the lipoplex, changes in particle size were monitored by light scattering as a function of the SAINT/DNA charge ratio. At 150 mm NaCl, the stability of SAINT/DOPE-DNA complexes reflected a colloidal behavior typical of that of the pure liposomes, as shown in Fig. 4. In these experiments, SAINT/DOPE vesicles were prepared in water and, subsequently, mixed with plasmid in HBS buffer. The turbidity of the complex suspensions at the indicated charge ratios was measured after 10 min. In line with the colloidal stability of their vesicular entities, lipoplexes consisting of SAINT-21/DOPE (1:1) and SAINT-27/DOPE (1:1) were only marginally destabilized in the presence of DNA and did not precipitate over a period of about 3 h. Significant aggregation was only observed at a charge ratio of about 2.5, indicating that around this ratio, the repulsion between the head groups of the cationic lipids was lowest. In contrast to SAINT-21 and SAINT-27, SAINT-2/DOPE (1:1) lipoplexes were highly unstable and precipitated in the presence of 150 mmNaCl. The charge neutralizing effect reached a maximum at a charge ratio (+/−) of ∼5.0, representing conditions at which the reduced electrostatic repulsion between the complexes led to their precipitation. Interestingly, the neutralization point for SAINT-2 lipoplexes is reached at a 2-fold higher concentration of cationic lipid than that observed in case of SAINT-27-and SAINT-21 lipoplexes. This difference would imply that the SAINT-2 complexes accommodate twice as much cationic lipid at the same amount of DNA than complexes assembled from either SAINT-21 or SAINT-27. To examine whether this remarkable distinction correlated with differences in structural features as noted above, i.e. involving a lamellarversus nonlamellar transition in case of SAINT-2 but not SAINT-21 or SAINT 27 in the presence of 150 mm NaCl, the SAINT lipoplexes were further characterized by electron microscopy and SAXS. Both negative staining and cryo-transmission electron microscopy were used to examine the morphology of complexes formed by the three different SAINTs, as prepared in the presence of 150 mm NaCl. As already anticipated from the differences in their colloidal properties, the morphology of SAINT-21 and SAINT-27 lipoplexes on the one hand and that of SAINT-2 lipoplexes on the other hand differed remarkably. At a charge ratio of 2.5, lipoplexes consisting of SAINT-21 and SAINT-27 gave rise to the formation of distinct globules, showing condensed multilayers with a diameter of about 500 nm (Fig. 5). By contrast, SAINT-2-containing complexes (Fig. 6 A) showed aggregates that did not display a multilayered structure, and after several hours, these clustered complexes reached diameters up to 1 μm. The electron dense core of these structures revealed again typical striated features (Fig. 6 B), very similar to those seen within the lumen of SAINT-2/DOPE vesicles in NaCl/HEPES (Fig. 3 B). Note that cryo-TEM images of SAINT-2/DOPE lipoplexes prepared in water display an entirely different morphology, showing a lamellar structure similar to that of SAINT-27 and SAINT-21 lipoplexes (not shown; Fig. 5), as reported previously (13Meekel, A. A., Wagenaar, A., S̆misterová, J., Kroeze, J. E., Haadsma, P., Bosgraaf, B., Stuart, M. C. A., Brisson, A., Ruiters, M. H. J., Hoekstra, D., and Engberts, J. B. F. N. (2000) Eur. J. Org. Chem.665–673Google Scholar). To further investigate the structural organization underlying the morphological features of these various complexes, SAXS measurements were subsequently carried out.Figure 6Cryo-TEM of SAINT-2/DOPE lipoplexes.Lipoplexes were prepared in 150 mm NaCl (HBS buffer, pH 7.4) at a molar charge ratio of 2.5:1. A shows an overall view of the complexes. B shows a detail of the lipoplex particles shown in A, revealing striated features, typical of nonlamellar structures. The bars represent 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The lamellar organization of SAINT-27/DOPE (1:1) lipoplexes at physiological salt concentrations, as suggested by electron microscopy, was confirmed by SAXS measurements (Fig. 7). Diffraction maxima were obtained at q 1 = 0.97 nm−1 andq 2 = 1.93 nm−1, and the ratio between these values of 1:2 suggests a lamellar morphology with a periodicity of 6.5 nm. Note that the same structural organization was determined for DNA-devoid SAINT-27/DOPE vesicles (not shown), as described above. Similar analyses of SAINT-2/DOPE (1:1) lipoplexes (Fig. 8 C) revealed at least four distinct diffraction peaks at q values of 1.03, 1.78, 2.06, and 2.69 nm−1, whereas two weaker maxima are apparent at q = 3.1 and 3.6 nm−1. In this case the location of the peaks is in the ratio of1:3:4:7:9:12,which is typical of a hexagonal phase. The periodicity of the phase is about 7.1 nm. For the DNA-devoid SAINT-2/DOPE complex in salt solution, the periodicity was similar (7.2 nm), as shown above (Fig. 3 C), whereas three diffraction maxima were obtained at slightly lower q values. Thus addition of DNA appears to result in an increased ordering of the structure. Interestingly and importantly, SAINT-2 containing lipoplexes, prepared either in water (Fig. 8 A) or in HBS but without DOPE (Fig. 8 B), retained the lamellar topology with periodicities of 6.5 and 5.9 nm, respectively. In both cases, only two diffraction maxima were obtained at q values of 0.97 and 1.91 nm−1 (in water; Fig. 8 A) and at 1.06 and 2.00 nm−1 (without DOPE in HBS; Fig. 8 B), implying q value ratios of approx. 1:2 and 1:1.9, i.e. typical of a lamellar structure. Thus both inclusion of DOPE and complex preparation at physiological salt conditions are needed to form lipoplexes with a hexagonal structure. Interestingly, when the SAINT-2/DOPE lipoplexes were prepared in water and subsequently transferred to HBS buffer, it was still possible for the lamellar phase, obtained at these conditions, to transform into the hexagonal lattice, as shown in Fig. 9. However, the lipoplexes thus obtained showed a lower level of structural organization than that obtained for complexes prepared at physiological salt conditions. This was inferred from the observation that the former complexes showed a periodicity of 6.8 nm, with less distinguished and less sharp diffraction peaks at q = 1.09, 1.81, and 2.10 nm−1 (Fig. 9).Figure 8Effect of salt concentration and DOPE on the structure of SAINT-2 lipoplexes. Small angle x-ray scattering was carried out for SAINT-2 containing complexes prepared at various conditions. A shows the diffraction pattern obtained for SAINT-2/DOPE (1:1) complexed with pCMV β-gal in water. SAINT-2 liposomes without DOPE (B) and with DOPE (C) (1:1) were complexed with the same plasmid in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and the complexes were analyzed similarly. In each case, the SAINT to DNA molar charge ratio was 2.5:1. In A and B the first sharp and second less sharp Bragg reflections arise from lamellar membrane stacking with periodicities (d) of 6.4 and 5.9 nm, respectively. In C, the hexagonal structure with a unit cell spacing of 7.1 nm can be identified.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 9SAXS pattern of SAINT-2/DOPE lipoplexes, prepared in water, following a transfer to HBS buffer (150 mm NaCl).

Defective or inappropriate regulation of PTPase activity leads to aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation, which contributes to the development of many human diseases including cancers and diabetes. For example, recent gene knockout studies in mice identify PTP1B as a promising target for anti-diabetes/obesity drug discovery. Thus, there is intense interest in obtaining specific and potent PTPase inhibitors for biological studies and pharmacological development. However, given the highly conserved nature of the PTPase active site, it is unclear whether selectivity in PTPase inhibition can be achieved. We describe a combinatorial approach that is designed to target both the active site and a unique peripheral site in PTP1B. Compounds that can simultaneously associate with both sites are expected to exhibit enhanced affinity and specificity. We also describe a novel affinity-based high-throughput assay procedure that can be used for PTPase inhibitor screening. The combinatorial library/high-throughput screen protocols furnished a small molecule PTP1B inhibitor that is both potent (K i = 2.4 nm) and selective (little or no activity against a panel of phosphatases including Yersinia PTPase, SHP1, SHP2, LAR, HePTP, PTPα, CD45, VHR, MKP3, Cdc25A, Stp1, and PP2C).

Phosphotyrosine level, in turn, is maintained in an exquisite balance by the reciprocal activities of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases).1 To date, a large number of PTPases have been identified. Because balanced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is critical for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, it is not surprising that PTPase malfunction has been linked to many human diseases (1Zhang Z.-Y. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Consequently, in those instances where PTPase activity is inappropriately high, PTPase inhibitors may provide a valuable new family of therapeutic agents. However, drug development targeted to PTPases was not seriously considered until recently. A major concern is that a PTPase may regulate multiple signaling pathways, whereas, at the same time, a single pathway may be controlled by several PTPases. Thus, PTPase inhibition may give rise to unwanted side effects. Significant progress has been made that is beginning to alleviate this concern. For example, PTP1B has been suggested as a negative regulator of insulin signaling (2Ahmad F. Li P.M. Meyerovitch J. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20503-20508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 3Kenner K.A. Anyanwu E. Olefsky J.M. Kusari J. J. Biol.

In addition to a role in insulin signaling, PTP1B is overexpressed in association with the expression of p185c-erbB-2 in human breast and ovarian cancers (5Wiener J.R. Kerns B.J.M. Harvey E.L.

Recently, PTP1B has been identified as the major PTPase that dephosphorylates and activates c-Src in several human breast cancer cell lines (9Bjorge J.D. Pang A. Fujita D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41439-41446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). PTP1B is also capable of antagonizing signaling by the epidermal growth factor receptor (10Liu F. Chernoff J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 11Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2965-2975Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) by directly dephosphorylating the epidermal growth factor receptor and the p210 bcr-abl tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, PTP1B can negatively regulate integrin-mediated adhesion and signaling by binding and dephosphorylating β-catenin (13Balsamo J. Arregui C. Leung T. Lilien J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and p130 cas (Crk-associated substrate) (14Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Interestingly, other potential substrates for PTP1B include the prolactin-activated signal transducers and activators of transcription STAT5a and STAT5b (15Aoki N. Matsuda T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39718-39726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The results described above, taken together, suggest that PTP1B may be a participant in several signaling pathways. Thus, PTP1B might not be considered as an ideal target for drug development. However, PTP1B−/− mice display increased insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 phosphorylation and enhanced sensitivity to insulin in skeletal muscle and liver (16Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J. Chan C.C. Ramachandran C. Gresser M.J. Tremblay M.L. Kennedy B.P.

In addition, PTP1B−/− mice have remarkably low adiposity and are protected from diet-induced obesity. Perhaps most importantly, these mice appeared to be normal and healthy, indicating that regulation of insulin signaling by PTP1B is tissue- and cell type-specific. These observations suggest that specific PTP1B inhibitors might be free of side effects and highlight the potential of selective therapeutic efficacy in targeting PTP1B (anti-diabetes/obesity) even though PTP1B is expressed ubiquitously. As expected, interest in the development of PTPase-based therapeutics has recently intensified. Clearly, however, potent and selective PTPase inhibitors are required before therapeutic intervention with PTPase inhibitors can become a reality. Structural and mutational studies have shown that amino acids involved in catalysis or formation of the Tyr(P) binding site (the active site) are conserved (18Jia Z. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 19Zhang Z.-Y. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 1-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 20Sarmiento M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8171-8179Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), indicating that PTPases utilize similar mechanisms for phosphomonoester hydrolysis and Tyr(P) recognition. Can specificity be achieved by targeting the PTPase active site for inhibitor development? A similar question was raised in the protein kinase field because of the structural conservation of the ATP binding site. Despite the latter, a number of highly selective, ATP-binding site-targeted, protein kinase inhibitors have been described (21Lawrence D.S. Niu J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 77: 81-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In several instances, structural studies reveal that specificity comes from the fact that only a portion of each inhibitor interacts with the residues that bind ATP, whereas the rest of the molecule makes contact with residues situated outside the ATP-binding pocket (22Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies of PTPases with Tyr(P)-containing peptides showed that Tyr(P) alone is not sufficient for high affinity binding and residues surrounding the Tyr(P) contribute to efficient substrate recognition (23Zhang Z.-Y. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1997; 35: 21-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 24Vetter S.W. Keng Y.F. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2265-2268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This suggests that there are subpockets bordering the active site that can be targeted to enhance inhibitor affinity and selectivity. Furthermore, the Tyr(P)-binding site in PTPases is obviously smaller than the ATP site in protein kinases. Thus, for PTPase inhibitor design, it is critical to consider adjacent peripheral sites in addition to the active site to gain potency and selectivity. In this paper, we describe the construction of a novel combinatorial library designed to target both the active site and an adjacent peripheral site in PTP1B. We also describe the development of an ELISA-based affinity selection procedure that was used to screen for potent PTP1B ligands. We have identified a highly potent PTP1B inhibitor (with a K i value of 2.4 nm) that exhibits several orders of magnitude selectivity in favor of PTP1B against a panel of PTPases. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve potency and selectivity for PTPase inhibition. All moisture-sensitive reactions were carried out in oven-dried glassware under a positive pressure of dry N2 or Ar. DMA, DMF, Me2SO, lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, CH2Cl2, and THF for moisture-sensitive reactions were purchased from Aldrich in Sure/Seal™ bottles. All reactions were followed by thin layer chromatography using E. Merck silica gel 60 F-254. Flash column chromatography was performed using J.T. Baker silica gel (230–400 mesh). Benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, 1,3-diisopropylcarbodiimide, HBTU, HOBt, piperidine, benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, tetramethylfluoroformamidinium hexafluorophosphate, andO-(N-succinimidyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate for peptide synthesis were purchased from Advanced ChemTech. The structures of new compounds were characterized by1H NMR (300 MHz), 13C NMR (75.5 MHz),19F NMR (282 MHz), and 31P NMR (121 MHz) at 299 K unless otherwise indicated, and by ESI-MS analysis. Peptides (biotinyl-caproic acid-DADEpYL-amide and 7-hydroxycoumarin-caproic acid-DADEpYL-amide) were synthesized on Rink amide resin (Advanced ChemTech) using a standard protocol for HBTU/HOBt/NMM activation of Fmoc-protected amino acid derivatives (Advanced ChemTech or Novabiochem). 7-Hydroxycoumarin-4-acetic acid and biotin (Aldrich) were activated with 1.5 eq ofO-(N-succinimidyl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate and 4 eq of N,N-diisopropylethylamine in DMF. Side chains of Asp and Glu were tert-butyl-protected; the phosphate group of Tyr(P) was mono-benzyl ester-protected. The coupling reaction was performed in DMF for 1.5 h using a 3-fold excess of acid relative to resin-bound amine. Fmoc removal was performed with 20% piperidine in DMF. Final cleavage and side chain deprotection was achieved with 95% trifluoroacetic acid and 2.5% triisopropylsilane in water for 2 h. The resin was removed by filtration, and the remaining solution concentrated. Dry diethyl ether was added and the precipitated peptides collected by centrifugation. The peptides were resuspended, washed twice with ether, dissolved in water, and purified by semipreparative reverse phase HPLC. All peptides were obtained in high purity (>95%) as analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and analytical HPLC. The library was synthesized on a cystamine-modified Tentagel S NH2 resin1 using Fmoc chemistry (25Lee T.R. Lawrence D.S. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Tyr(P) was attached to the amino terminus of the resin-linked cystamine (8 g). After Fmoc removal by two 5-min treatments with 30% piperidine in DMF, the resin was washed with DMF, CH2Cl2, isopropanol, and ether, and then the residual solvent removed in vacuo. The resin was distributed in 220-mg quantities into 20-ml polypropylene filtration tubes (Supelco) for coupling of the next component. The linking diversity elements 4–25 (Fig. 2) were incorporated (except for the absence of a diversity element 26) into the library in the Fmoc-protected form, which were either commercially available or prepared by treatment of commercially available amino acids with Fmoc-Osu in 1:1 THF and 10% Na2CO3. Coupling was accomplished by one 2-h treatment and one 15-h treatment with 6 eq of the amino acid, 6 eq of benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, 6 eq of HOBt, and 12 eq of NMM in 4 ml of DMF. The phosphate group of Tyr(P) used in the library synthesis was mono-benzyl ester-protected, and the acid side chains of Asp and Glut-butyl ester-protected. The N-terminal Fmoc group was deprotected by two 5-min treatments with 30% piperidine in DMF. The resin was then washed with DMF, CH2Cl2, isopropanol, and ether, and the residual solvent removed in vacuo. The coupling and deprotection steps were monitored by examination of free amine substitution level or Fmoc release during the course of the library synthesis until the coupling of the terminal diversity elements. The resin from each filtration tube was then distributed in 5.0-mg quantities into 8 wells in one line of the 96-well synthesis block. The terminal diversity elementsA–H (Fig. 1) were incorporated into the library by one 2-h and one 15-h coupling using 6 eq of the acid, 6 eq of tetramethylfluoroformamidinium hexafluorophosphate, and 12 eq ofN,N-diisopropylethylamine in 500 μl of DMF. Those acids containing the phenyl phosphate group were prepared from the carboxyl methyl ester of the corresponding phenol via treatment with phosphoryl chloride in pyridine (26Chen L. Montserat J. Lawrence D.S. Zhang Z.-Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9349-9354Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), followed by basic hydrolysis. 2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-diacid was prepared from 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (GFS Chemicals) by treatment with KMnO4 in 25% H2SO4 (27Launikonis A. Lay P.A. Mau A.W.-H. Sargeson A.M. Sasse W.H.F. Aust. J. Chem. 1986; 39: 1053-1062Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Upon completion of the solid-phase assembly, side chain deprotection was accomplished by two 1-h treatments with 90% trifluoroacetic acid and 5% phenol in water. The resulting resin 3 was then washed extensively with CH2Cl2, DMF, MeOH, and H2O before treatment with 10 mm DTT in 500 μl of 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 8.0) for 3 h. Finally the solution phase was filtered into the 96-well receiving plate to afford the spatially separated library members 3 at a concentration of 0.1 mm (assuming complete conversion for each member). Several library members were resynthesized on larger scale using the same procedure in high yield and purity (about 90%) as assessed by HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS analysis. These library members include the structure 3 derived from subunits A and17 (MOLDI-TOF MS calculated for [M] 653, found [M − H]− 652.8) and structure 3 derived from subunits C and 6 (MOLDI-TOF MS calculated for [M] 633, found [M + H]+ 634.2).Figure 1Terminal diversity elements used in the library of the general structure 3 to target a unique peripheral site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Several high affinity members of the library were selected based on the initial ELISA screening results, and their analogs without a thiol tail were synthesized on Rink resin according to the above peptide synthesis procedure.

To sodium hydride (77 mg, 3.2 mmol) in 10 ml of THF at −20 °C was added dropwise diethyl phosphite (430 μl, 3.3 mmol). The solution was stirred for 20 min before a solution of benzyl 4-formylphenylacetate 29 (750 mg, 3.0 mmol) in 8 ml of THF was added. The solution was stirred for additional 30 min and the reaction quenched with 10 ml of 5% NH4Cl solution.

The N-terminal sequence of the azoreductase conformed to that of the acpD gene product, acyl carrier protein phosphodiesterase. Overexpression of the acpD gene provided the E. coli with a large amount of the 23-kDa protein and more than 800 times higher azoreductase activity. The purified gene product exhibited activity corresponding to that of the native azoreductase.

Their durability, however, causes pollution once the dyes are released into the environment as effluent. In addition, some azo dyes are toxic and mutagenic (1Holme I. Griffiths J. Ecological Aspects of Color Chemistry: Developments in the Chemistry and Technology of Organic Dyes. Society of Chemistry Industry, Oxford1984: 111-128Google Scholar). Azoreductases of microorganisms are favorable for the development of biodegradation systems for such azo dyes, because these enzymes catalyze reductive cleavage of azo groups (-N=N-) under mild conditions. In addition, bacterial enzymes can be readily overproduced in bacterial cells. Identification and overproduction of azoreductase constitute a straightforward approach for the development of biodegradation systems. Previous studies mainly focused on the screening of microorganisms exhibiting high azoreductase activity. For example, Acetobacter liquefaciens S-1 (2Wong P.K. Yuen P.Y. Wat. Res. 1996; 30: 1736-1744Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and Klebsiella pneumoniae RS-13 (3Zimmermann T. Kulla H.G. Leisinger T. Eur. J.

Gasser F. Kulla H.G. Leisinger T. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 138: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and it was revealed that both enzymes utilize NAD(P)H for Orange II (1-(4′-sulfophenylazo)-2-naphthol) degradation. However, the properties and genes of azoreductases have been poorly understood. Recently, an azoreductase gene was identified in Bacillussp. (5Suzuki Y. Yoda T. Ruhul A. Sugiura W. J. Biol.

The gene product (20 kDa) catalyzed the reduction of azo dyes (Roccellin, Sumifix Black, and Solar Orange) in the presence of NADPH. On the other hand, acyl carrier protein phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.14) (6Fischl A.S. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5445-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) converts holo-acyl carrier protein (ACP)1 into apoACP by catalyzing hydrolysis of the phosphodiester linkage between Ser36 of ACP and the 4′-phosphopantethein prosthetic group. ACP is a small protein (molecular mass, 8847 Da) that plays a central role in the biosynthesis of fatty acids in bacteria, plant chloroplasts, and other organisms (7Van der Boom T. Cronan Jr., J.E.

ACP phosphodiesterase is known to be coded by the acpD gene in Escherichia coli. Although the physiological role of ACP phosphodiesterase remains obscure at present (6Fischl A.S. Kennedy E.P. J.

In this paper, we report the 4500-fold purification and N-terminal sequencing of a native azoreductase of E. coli. A search of the translated data bases allowed identification of the acpDgene as the gene for the azoreductase. Overexpression of theacpD gene allowed the preparation of azoreductase, in 190-mg quantities, having no ACP phosphodiesterase activity. The biochemical properties of the azoreductase have also been revealed. E. coli JM109, Q-Sepharose FF, Q-Sepharose HP, Blue-Sepharose, Sephacryl S200, phenyl-Sepharose, and a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 prepack column were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. GIGAPITE was from Seikagaku (Tokyo, Japan). Methyl red, FAD, FMN, 2-aminobenzoic acid (ABA), and N,N′-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DMPD) were from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Ethyl red (4′-diethylaminoazobenzene-2-carboxylic acid) and Ponceau SX (3-[(2,4-dimethyl-5-sulfophenyl)azo]-4-hydroxy-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid) were from Tokyo Kasei (Tokyo, Japan). Menadione was from Sigma. NAD(P)H were from Oriental Yeast (Tokyo, Japan). The standard assay system for azoreductase comprised 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 μm methyl red, 0.1 mm NADH, 20 μm FMN, and enzyme, in a final volume of 2 ml. The reaction was initiated by addition of the enzyme. The initial reaction rate was determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 430 nm in the first 1.5 min in a glass cuvette of 1.0-cm light path at 30 °C. The enzyme activity was a linear function of the incubation time. One unit of methyl red reductase activity was defined as the amount catalyzing the degradation of 1 μmol of methyl red/min at 30 °C using a molar absorption coefficient of 23,360m−1 cm−1. When methyl red was replaced with other azo dyes, the following molar absorption coefficients and wavelengths were used: 21,560m−1 cm−1 (ethyl red at 450 nm) and 18,680 m−1 cm−1 (Ponceau SX at 500 nm). We confirmed that the absorption of NADH did not affect the absorption of the azo dyes. One unit of menadione reductase activity was defined as the amount catalyzing the reduction of 1 μmol NAD(P)H/min at 30 °C using a molar absorption coefficient of 6220m−1 cm−1. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. E. coli (JM109) cells that had been grown at 37 °C as 10-liter cultures in LB medium (1.0% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1.0% NaCl, pH 7.0) were resuspended in 160 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA). Lysozyme was added to give a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, and then the solution was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The viscous solution was chilled and subjected to sonication disruption (180-watt output, 30 s three times). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,500 × g for 15 min. The cell extract was applied at 0.6 ml/min to a Q-Sepharose FF column (16 × 2.5 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A. After washing of the column with 800 ml of buffer A at 0.6 ml/min, azoreductase was eluted with 400 ml of buffer A containing a linear gradient of NaCl, from 0 to 0.6 m. Each fraction (fraction size, 6 ml) was subjected to activity measurement; the seven fractions containing the highest levels of activity were pooled. The pooled fraction was applied at 0.5 ml/min to a Blue-Sepharose column (6.5 × 2.0 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A. After washing of the column with 200 ml of buffer A, azoreductase was eluted with 70 ml of buffer A containing 0.4 mm NADH. The eluate was concentrated to 6 ml on a YM-10 membrane and then applied at 0.3 ml/min to a Sephacryl S200 column (90 × 1.6 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The two fractions (fraction size, 3 ml) containing the highest activity were pooled. The pooled fraction was applied at 0.3 ml/min to a GIGAPITE column (3 × 1.4 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer B. After washing of the column with buffer B at 0.3 ml/min, azoreductase was eluted with 60 ml of buffer B containing a linear gradient of potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), from 0 to 50 mm. The 10 fractions (fraction size, 3 ml) containing activity were pooled, and the buffer was exchanged with buffer A. The enzyme solution was applied at 0.3 ml/min to a Q-Sepharose HP column (1.5 × 1.4 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A. After washing of the column with buffer A, azoreductase was eluted with 20 ml of buffer A containing a linear gradient of NaCl, from 0 to 0.6m. The 10 fractions (fraction size, 2 ml) containing activity were pooled. Ammonium sulfate was dissolved in the pooled fraction to obtain 30% saturation (164 g/liter). The solution was applied at 0.3 ml/min to a phenyl-Sepharose column (1 by 0.8 cm) that had been pre-equilibrated with buffer A containing ammonium sulfate (30% saturation). The column was washed with the buffer, and then 40 ml of a linear gradient of ammonium sulfate, 30–0% saturation, in buffer A was applied. The fraction containing activity was concentrated and stored at −20 °C after adding glycerol to give 20% (v/v) concentration. One microgram of the purified enzyme was run on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide Tricine gel (1 mm thick) (17Ploug M. Jensen A.L. Barkholt V. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 181: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and then blotted onto a ProBlot® poly(vinylidene difluoride) membrane (Applied Biosystems). The protein band was examined with an Applied Biosystems model 477A protein sequencer, fitted with an on-line model 120A analyzer for the detection of phenylthiohydantoin-amino acids. The acpD gene was obtained by PCR using genomic DNA of E. coli strain JM109 as the template. Pfuturbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and oligonucleotide primers (sense, 5′-cggccatatgagcaaggtattagtt-3′ containing an NdeI site; antisense, 5′-gcgctcgagttatgcagaaacaat-3′ containing a XhoI site) were used for PCR. The resulting DNA was subcloned into the corresponding restriction site of pET22b to obtain a plasmid designated as pETacpD. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. E. coli JM109 (DE3) harboring pETacpD was grown at 37 °C in LB medium. Expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 3 h with an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6. The recombinant AcpD was purified by Q-Sepharose, Blue-Sepharose, Sephacryl S200, and GIGAPITE column chromatographies. Using the standard assay system (2 ml) with 7.8 ng of the purified acpD gene product (designated as AcpD), the methyl red degradation rate and NADH consumption rate in the first 1.5 min were determined by monitoring the absorbance at 430 and 340 nm, respectively. Because the absorbance of methyl red at 340 nm was a linear function of the absorbance at 430 nm under the given conditions, the absorbance at 340 nm in the standard assay system was corrected by calculation. The molar absorption coefficients were as described above. Methyl red was incubated in 40 ml of the standard assay system for 10 min at 30 °C with the purified AcpD (20 μg). For extraction of ABA, an aliquot (20 ml) of the reaction mixture was extracted with an equal volume of ethyl acetate three times, subsequent to adjusting the pH to 3 with 1 m HCl. The extracts were pooled and evaporated in a rotary evaporator. For DMPD, another aliquot (20 ml) was extracted with an equal volume of n-hexane three times, subsequent to adjusting the pH to 10 with 1 m NaOH. The extracts were pooled and evaporated in a rotary evaporator. Each residue was dissolved in 0.5 ml of acetonitrile. Each sample was diluted 200-fold with acetonitrile and then analyzed (20 μl) with a Shimadzu HPLC system equipped with a model SPD-6AV variable wavelength detector (detection wavelength: 336 nm for ABA; 250 nm for DMPD) and a Jasco CrestPak ODS column (4.6 mm × 150 mm). The mobile phase was composed of 25 mm phosphate and acetonitrile, 5:95 (25 mm phosphate:acetonitrile). The flow rate was 0.8 ml/min. The gene for ACP was amplified using genomic DNA of E. coli strain JM109 as the template for PCR. The forward primer included an EcoRI site before the start codon: 5′-ctggaattcatgagcactatcga-3′. The reverse primer included aHindIII restriction site after the stop codon: 5′-ctgaagcttttacgcctggtggc-3′. The PCR product was subcloned into theEcoRI/HindIII site of the pKK223–3 plasmid, and the resulting plasmid was designated as pKKacpP. E. coliJM109 was transformed with pKKacpP and grown at 37 °C with LB medium. After the cultures had been grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6, expression was induced with 0.5 mm IPTG for 3 h. The purification procedure followed the method of Therisodet al. (18Therisod H. Weissborn A.C. Kennedy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The assay system comprised 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.02 mm MnCl2, 25 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg of holo/apoACP, and 3.7 μg of purified AcpD, in a final volume of 0.1 ml. After incubation at 35 °C for 12 h, a sample was analyzed by native PAGE (19Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For the holoACP standard, 20 μg of holo/apoACP was converted to holoACP under the conditions with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.8), 0.1 mm CoA, 25 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 4.2 μg of ACP synthase. ACP synthase was expressed and purified by a procedure based on that of Lambalot and Walsh (20Lambalot R.H. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24658-24661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For the apoACP standard, Ser36-substituted ACP was used. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with substitution from Ser to Cys. The expression and purification procedure were the same as those for the wild type. ACP was coexpressed with AcpD in E. coli and then analyzed by native PAGE. To obtain a plasmid (designated as pACYCacpP) that was compatible with pETacpD and produced ACP, theBamHI-HincII 0.6-kb DNA fragment of pACYC177 (21Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was replaced by the 1.4-kb BamHI-PvuI fragment (the cohesive end of the PvuI site was blunt-ended) from pKKacpP. The 1.4-kb fragment contained a tac promoter, theACP gene, and rrnB ribosomal RNA transcription terminators. E. coli JM109 (DE3) was cotransformed with pACYCacpP and pETacpD or pET21a (for a control experiment). Expression was induced by the addition of IPTG as described above. Protein concentrations were determined using protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad), with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was carried out using 12.5% gels as described by Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). The proteins on gels were stained using a Silver Stain Kit II (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). The native molecular weight of the protein was determined by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 HR column (30 × 1.0 cm) that had been equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.15 m NaCl). Calibration of the column was carried out with the following proteins: alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), all from Sigma. The azoreductase activity in the 12,500 × g supernatant of the E. colihomogenate was 0.014 units/mg. The enzyme was purified from the supernatant (Fig. 1) with an overall activity recovery of 0.7% and about 4500-fold purification by a combination of anion exchange, dye affinity, gel filtration, hydroxyapatite, and hydrophobic interaction chromatographies (TableI). The azoreductase exhibited molecular masses of 23 and 42 kDa on SDS-PAGE and gel filtration, respectively.Table ISummary of purification of azoreductase from E. coliStepProteinActivityYieldTotalSpecificmgunitsunits/mg%Extract262437.30.014100Q-Sepharose66030.90.04783Blue-Sepharose4.511.62.631Sephacryl S2000.535.39.914GIGAPITE0.042.662.06.9Q-Sepharose HP0.011.3127.33.6Phenyl-Sepharose1-aBecause of the lability of this enzyme at lower protein concentration, the specific activity and yield were reduced.0.0040.363.90.71-a Because of the lability of this enzyme at lower protein concentration, the specific activity and yield were reduced. Open table in a new tab The N terminus of the azoreductase was not blocked and revealed to be NH2-Ser-Lys-Val-Leu-Val-Leu-Lys-. The sequence conformed to the acpD gene product (AcpD), known as ACP phosphodiesterase (6Fischl A.S. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5445-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the azoreductase activity of AcpD, the acpD gene was overexpressed in E. coli. In all purification procedures (Fig. 2 and TableII), AcpD behaved the same as the native azoreductase. Furthermore, AcpD exhibited identical migration with the azoreductase in an SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 1, lane 8). The enzyme activity was also the same as that of the azoreductase (TableIII). These results indicate that the azoreductase is identical with AcpD.Table IISummary of purification of recombinant AcpDStepProteinActivity2-aThe values indicate azoreductase activity but not ACP phosphodiesterase activity.YieldTotalSpecificmgunitsunits/mg%Extract39152,834135100Q-Sepharose26340,99315678Blue-Sepharose24138,14215872Sephacryl S20022038,52717573GIGAPITE19235,736186682-a The values indicate azoreductase activity but not ACP phosphodiesterase activity.

Open table in a new tab The activity is expressed as the mean ± S.E. (n> 3). In parentheses is the relative activity with the FMN-dependent methyl red reductase activity taken as 100%. The absorption spectrum of AcpD (0.47 mg/ml) exhibited a single peak at 278 nm, ranging in wavelength from 250 nm to 600 nm. The single peak indicated the absence of a flavin cofactor. The fluorescence emission of AcpD (0.22 mg/ml, 11 μm) showed a maximum at around 310 nm, ranging from 280 to 380 nm (Fig. 3). When the enzyme solution was titrated with FMN or FAD, the fluorescence at 310 nm was gradually quenched. The degree of quenching by 12 μm(slightly more than the stoichiometric amount) FMN and FAD was 70 and 30%, respectively (Fig. 3). The greater quenching by FMN implied the FMN specificity of AcpD. Double-reciprocal plots of initial velocity versus NADH or methyl red concentration resulted in parallel patterns (Fig. 4,A and B). The patterns are consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. Secondary plots of the intercepts against the reciprocals of variable substrate concentrations gave linear correlations. The K m values for NADH and methyl red were calculated to be 31.6 and 17.9 μm, respectively. The products of the standard reaction of AcpD were extracted under acidic (pH 3) and basic (pH 10) conditions. HPLC analyses of the extracts gave peaks of ABA (retention time, 2.23–2.25 min) and DMPD (retention time, 4.16–4.23 min). The retention times of ABA and DMPD completely coincided with those of each authentic compound. In the absence of AcpD, NADH, or FMN, no peak other than that of methyl red (retention time, 5.2 min) was observed. Thus, AcpD catalyzed the reductive cleavage of methyl red into ABA and DMPD. Spectrophotometrically, 1 mol of methyl red was reduced with 2 mol of NADH. This coincided with the expected stoichiometry for reductive cleavage of the azo bond of methyl red. acpD was originally reported as the gene coding ACP phosphodiesterase. The phosphodiesterase activity was examined here by a method based on native PAGE analysis. For the assay, overexpressed and purified ACP was used as the substrate. The purified ACP was separated into two bands on native PAGE (Fig. 5, lane 1). N-terminal sequence analyses of the materials confirmed its identity as ACP. The lower band was confirmed to be that of holoACP because of the convergence of the upper band and the lower band with the ACP synthase reaction in the presence of CoA (Fig. 5, lane 3). ACP synthase transfers the 4′-phosphopantetheine moiety from CoA to Ser36 of apoACP to produce holoACP. On the other hand, the apo type was confirmed to be the upper band by using a mutant ACP in which the Ser36 residue was replaced by Cys. The mutant ACP only gave the upper band (Fig. 5, lane 4). The purified AcpD was subjected to the ACP phosphodiesterase assay as described (6Fischl A.S. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5445-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the reaction did not affect the ratio of apo- and holoACP, even in the presence of an excess amount of AcpD (Fig. 5, lane 2). An in vivoassay was also carried out to examine the function of AcpD. Because proteins other than the ACP-derived species were observed to remain in the stacker gel (23Morris S.A. Revill W.P. Stauton J. Leadlay P.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), crude ACP preparations could be analyzed by native PAGE (Fig. 6). The cell extract ofE. coli overproducing AcpD (Fig. 6, lane 3) was compared with that of the control E. coli (Fig. 6,lane 4) by native PAGE. ACP was observed to be exclusively in its functionally active holo form regardless of AcpD overexpression. To gain insights into the gene and properties of azoreductase, we purified native azoreductase from the E. coli JM109 strain and identified acpD as the gene encoding the azoreductase. Overexpression of the acpD gene allowed the isolation of more than 190 mg of the gene product (AcpD). AcpD was catalytically similar to the native azoreductase, and exhibited the same molecular weights under denatured and nondenatured conditions as those of the native azoreductase as well as N-terminal sequence identity. HPLC analysis indicated that the decolorization of methyl red by AcpD is followed by cleavage of the molecule into colorless compounds, ABA and DMPD. The results proved that the decolorization of methyl red by AcpD was associated with reductive cleavage of the azo bond. The decolorization of methyl red by AcpD was analyzed using double-reciprocal plots of initial velocityversus NADH or methyl red concentration. The parallel lines obtained with the assays suggest that, as with methyl red, the catalysis mode of AcpD is a ping-pong Bi-Bi mechanism (Fig. 4). This mechanism suggests that FMN mediates electron-transfer from NADH to methyl red. This catalysis mode is generally observed for oxidoreductases containing a flavin prosthetic group such as quinone oxidoreductase. In view of the quinone (menadione) reductase activity observed for AcpD (Table III), the proposed catalysis mode is feasible. Apparently, AcpD required 2 mol of NADH for the decolorization of 1 mol of methyl red. This stoichiometry implies that two cycles of the ping-pong mechanism were required for the cleavage (SchemeFS1). In any case, the expression system reported here will provide a sufficient amount of azoreductase and greatly facilitate mechanistic studies on the reductive cleavage of azo dyes. Previously, two azoreductases were purified from E. coli K12 (24Ghosh D.K. Ghosh S. Sadhukhan P. Mandal A. Chaudhuri J. Indian J. Exp. Biol. 1993; 31: 951-954PubMed Google Scholar). These enzymes, 12.5 and 28 kDa on SDS-PAGE, utilized NAD(P)H for Ponceau SX degradation. For AcpD, the molecular mass was 23 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig.1), and NADPH was virtually ineffective as a cofactor. Furthermore, AcpD could not degrade Ponceau SX (Table II). Therefore, AcpD is different from the azoreductases of 12.5 and 28 kDa. Orange II azoreductase (3Zimmermann T. Kulla H.G. Leisinger T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 129: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) was purified from PseudomonasKF46. The enzyme exists as a monomer with a molecular mass of 30 kDa, and there is no enzyme-bound FAD. Although this enzyme requires NAD(P)H as an electron donor for its activity, a flavin cofactor is not required. Because AcpD requires FMN for its activity (Table III), AcpD must belong to a different protein family from Orange II azoreductase. Azoreductase from Bacillus sp. was reported recently (5Suzuki Y. Yoda T. Ruhul A. Sugiura W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9059-9065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The NADPH-dependent azoreductase comprises 178 amino acids and contains an NADH-binding motif (GXGXXG). Although this molecular size is similar to that of AcpD, we could not find this motif or significant homology in AcpD. NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase (NQO1, EC 1.6.99.2) is a FAD-containing enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes (25Bayney R.M. Rodkey J.A. Bennett C.D. Lu A.Y. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 572-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as quinones, and thus sequence comparison between AcpD and NQO1 from rat was performed. NQO1 consists of two separate domains (26Li R. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar): a major, “catalytic domain” (residues 1–220), and a small, “C-terminal domain” (residues 221–273). The catalytic domain is involved in the binding of the FMN moiety of FAD and the nicotinamide ribose of NADP+, whereas the C-terminal domain is responsible for the binding of adenine riboses from FAD and NADP+ (26Li R. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). AcpD exhibited moderate homology (Fig.7) to the “catalytic domain” and highly conserved the residues involved in the hydrogen bonds with the FMN moiety and nicotinamide ribose moiety. On the other hand, a part corresponding to the C-terminal domain of NQO1 is lacking in AcpD. These observations corroborate the cofactor specificity of AcpD from a structural aspect and imply that AcpD belongs to the quinone oxidoreductase family. ACP phosphodiesterase activity of AcpD was not detected in vivo or in vitro in this study. On the other hand, phosphodiesterase activity had been detected in vitro by monitoring the release of phospho-[3H]pantetheine from labeled ACP in an earlier study (6Fischl A.S. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5445-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy could be accounted for by misidentification of ACP phosphodiesterase. In the early study (6Fischl A.S. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5445-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the ACP phosphodiesterase was finally purified from a preparative SDS-PAGE gel by electroelution, because the phosphodiesterase remained active even after separation by SDS-PAGE. However, the purified fraction could be poor in authentic ACP phosphodiesterase but rich in AcpD because of the lower resolution on electroelution. Therefore, the protein band of ACP phosphodiesterase was misidentified as that of AcpD and the determined N-terminal sequence (NH2-Ser-Lys-Val-Leu-Lys-Ser-Xaa-Ile-Leu-Ala-Gly-Tyr-Ser-) was regarded as that of ACP phosphodiesterase. Moreover, theacpD gene was determined by another group (27Blattner F.R. Plunkett G.I.I.I. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J.

Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5934) Google Scholar) on the grounds of the correspondence of a translation sequence of the E. coli genome with the wrong N-terminal sequence of ACP phosphodiesterase. The function of the acpD gene has been demonstrated for the first time in this paper. Despite the lack of ACP phosphodiesterase activity, genes homologous toacpD of E. coli have been found in many microorganisms, as described above. This wide distribution suggests the essential function of AcpD. In conclusion, we have identified the gene responsible for azoreductase, constructed an efficient expression system, and biochemically characterized the enzyme. The results will contribute to the development of a biodegradation system for azo dyes via an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of azoreductase. To more accurately reflect its newly determined function, we propose the redesignation of the acpD gene as azoR."

It has been demonstrated that SMN levels produced from the SMN2 locus modify the severity of the disease in a dose-dependent manner (7Coovert D.D. Le T.T. McAndrew P.E. Strasswimmer J. Crawford T.O.

The ubiquitously expressed protein is detected at especially high levels in neuronal cells (7Coovert D.D. Le T.T. McAndrew P.E. Strasswimmer J. Crawford T.O. Mendell J.R. Coulson S.E. Androphy E.J.

Genet. 1997; 16: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Until recently, it was unclear why only mutations in the telomericSMN1 mutations result in SMA. A genomic sequence comparison of the two genes revealed that SMN1 and SMN2encode for the identical protein (12Monani U.R. Lorson C.L. Parsons D.W. Prior T.W. Androphy E.J. Burghes A.H. McPherson J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). However, three alternatively spliced transcripts generated with different efficiencies have been described for each locus (4Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S. Clermont O. Burlet P. Viollet L. Benichou B. Cruaud C. Millasseau P. Zeviani M. Le Paslier D. Frézal J. Cohen D. Weissenbach J. Munnich A. Melki J. Cell. 1995; 80: 155-165Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar). SMN1 primarily produces the full-length form of SMN, whereas differential splicing of theSMN2 pre-mRNA predominantly produces an isoform lacking exon 7 (SMNΔ7). Comparison of SMN transcripts revealed a direct relationship between SMA and exon 7 skipping. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that SMNΔ7 is unable to efficiently self-associate, a property that correlates with disease severity (13Lorson C.L. Strasswimmer J. Yao J.M. Baleja J.D. Hahnen E. Wirth B. Le T. Burghes A.H. Androphy E.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Thus, SMNΔ7 is not functionally equivalent to full-length SMN, and the failure ofSMN2 to fully compensate for mutations in SMN1 is because of a differential pre-mRNA-splicing event.The only critical nucleotide change between SMN1 andSMN2 affecting the inclusion of exon 7 has been pinpointed to a single C to T base difference located six nucleotides inside exon 7 (12Monani U.R.

Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This transition may disrupt a putative exon-splicing enhancer (ESE) (14Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), a cis-acting element that generally serves as binding sites for members of the serine-arginine (SR)-rich family of splicing factors (15Fu X.-D. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). An assembled splicing enhancer complex in turn promotes splice site and exon recognition by assisting in the recruitment of the splicing machinery to the adjacent intron through protein-protein interactions (16Hertel K.J. Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Graveley B.R. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1197-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Previous work demonstrated that the recognition of weak splice site signals could be aided significantly by the presence of ESEs. By contrast, ESEs have little or no detectable effect on the activation of strong splice sites that conform to the consensus sequence (15Fu X.-D. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hertel K.J. Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Graveley B.R. RNA (N.

Most ESEs studied in mechanistic detail activate 3′ splice sites that contain sub-optimal polypyrimidine tracts (py), a stretch of nucleotides immediately upstream of the exon/intron junction. Because py tracts and the 3′ splice site serve as binding sites for the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor (U2AF) (19Ruskin B. Zamore P.D. Green M.R.

Nature. 1999; 402: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), a model has emerged suggesting that enhancer complexes assembled on ESEs recruit U2AF to a weak 3′ splice site (24Wang Z. Hoffmann H.M. Grabowski P.J. RNA. 1995; 1: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zuo P. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1356-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 26Graveley B.R. Hertel K.J. Maniatis T. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 806-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the case ofSMN2, it was suggested that the C to T nucleotide difference in exon 7 might disrupt the integrity of a putative ESE to a degree that renders spliceosomal assembly and exon 7 recognition insignificant (12Monani U.R. Lorson C.L. Parsons D.W. Prior T.W. Androphy E.J. Burghes A.H. McPherson J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 14Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). As a consequence, exon 7 is skipped in SMN2, and SMNΔ7 is the product of the alternative processing event. A recent report has tested this hypothesis and demonstrated the presence of an ESE within exon 7 (27Lorson C.L. Androphy E.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 259-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the critical C to T transition observed between SMN1 and SMN2 was not contained within this region. In fact, within the nucleotide sequences around the C to T transition, no detectable ESE activities were observed. Thus, it is still unclear why the C to T transition leads to exon 7 skipping inSMN2.Because SMN2 cannot compensate for mutations withinSMN1, SMN1 is the SMA-determining gene. More importantly, however, because all individuals with SMA have retained their SMN2 allele, therapy directed toward increasingSMN2 exon 7 inclusion could provide a promising tool to lower the clinical severity of SMA. Recent studies have demonstrated that overexpression of hTra2, a splicing factor that was shown to interact with exon 7 of SMN, was able to tilt the balance of exon 7 inclusion in the SMN2 splicing pathway such that the majority of SMN2 mRNAs were full-length (28Hofmann Y. Lorson C.L. Stamm S. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9618-9623Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).To gain insights into the mechanism that leads to SMN2 exon 7 skipping, we have evaluated and compared the relative strength of exon 7 splice sites. Here we provide evidence that the C to T transition within exon 7 of SMN2 decreases the intrinsic strength of the upstream 3′ splice site (3′ss) by 2-fold. By contrast, the 5′ splice site (5′ss) of exon 7 is not affected by the nucleotide transition. We conclude that the competition between the 3′ss of exons 7 and 8 to pair with the 5′ss of exon 6 amplifies the relatively minor differences in exon 7 splice site strength. These observations suggested that modulation of the 3′ss competition could provide the means to facilitate the inclusion of exon 7, which contains the authentic translation stop codon into the SMN2-splicing pathway. We find that the application of antisense oligonucleotides that reduce the recognition of the 3′ splice site of exon 8 increases the incorporation of exon 7 into the fully processed transcript.RESULTSIt has been suggested that differential processing of the SMN1 and SMN2 pre-mRNAs is caused by the disruption of an ESE located within exon 7 of the transcript (12Monani U.R. Lorson C.L. Parsons D.W. Prior T.W. Androphy E.J. Burghes A.H. McPherson J.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1177-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 14Lorson C.L. Hahnen E. Androphy E.J. Wirth B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6307-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). The single nucleotide difference within exon 7 of SMN1 andSMN2 is located six nucleotides downstream of the 3′ splice site junction. Whereas the C to T transition does not change the coding sequence of the transcript, the recognition of exon 7 by components of the splicing machinery is severely altered. Less than 20% ofSMN2 pre-mRNAs are spliced to include exon 7, whereas more than 90% of SMN1 pre-mRNAs are processed to include exon 7. Generally, exon skipping is a consequence of the inability of the splicing machinery to recognize and define the exon (29Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Exon definition in turn predominantly relies on the strength of 3′ and 5′ splice site signals flanking the exon. Cis-acting RNA elements like ESEs or exonic splicing silencer elements facilitate this process by recruiting general splicing factors to the adjacent exon/intron junctions, thus augmenting the intrinsic strength of 3′ or 5′ splice site (16Hertel K.J. Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 30Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Because the C to T transition inSMN2 is proposed to disrupt a putative ESE element, it is expected that the efficiency at which the splicing machinery recognizes the 5′ or 3′ splice sites will be reduced. To test this hypothesis, we generated a set of SMN mini-genes that was assayed in cell transfection splicing assays.The C to T Transition in SMN2 Decreases the Utilization of the 3′ Splice Site of Exon 7To test the effects the C to T transition has on the strength of the 3′ss or 5′ss of exon 7, we designed two sets of identical mini-genes for SMN1 and SMN2 (Fig.2 A).SMNΔ8 lacks the majority of intron 7 and all of exon 8 and, thus, tests the activity of the 3′ss of exon 7.SMNΔ6 lacks exon 6 and the vast majority of intron 6 and, thus, tests the activity of the 5′ss of exon 7. Compared with the wild type substrate, these pre-mRNAs do not contain competing exons. Therefore, splice site activation leads to a single intron removal event. Processed as well as unprocessed RNA were amplified from total RNA preparations by PCR using intron-specific or exon-specific primer sets (see “Materials and Methods”). In the native context of competing splice sites, processing of theSMN1 and SMN2 wild type mini-genes lead to the characteristically strong difference in exon 7 inclusion (Fig. 2,B and C). However, as demonstrated in Fig.2 B, the difference of intron 6 removal was observed to be less pronounced for the SMN1Δ8 andSMN2Δ8 mini-genes (lanes 5 and6). Before calculating processing efficiencies, band intensities were normalized to the intensity of an internal control, the amplification product of the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (HPRT) (see “Materials and Methods”). Within a data set of four independent transfection experiments, a reproducible difference in splice site strength was determined to be approximately 2-fold (compare splicing efficiencies of 20 ± 3% forSMN1Δ8 with 9 ± 2% forSMN2Δ8) (Fig. 2 B, TableI). Thus, the C to T transition inSMN2 decreases the intrinsic strength of the 3′ss strength of exon 7 by 2-fold.Figure 2Comparison of SMN1 andSMN2 exon 7 splice site strength. A,SMN substrates tested. SMNΔ8 andSMNΔ6 constructs were created by deletion of exon 8 or exon 6, respectively.

Open table in a new tab To investigate if the C to T transition in SMN2 leads to a decrease in the strength of the 5′ss of exon 7, we compared theSMNΔ6 substrates. As demonstrated in Fig.2 C, the steady state levels of intron 7 removal were observed to be surprisingly low (0.5 ± 0.3% forSMN1Δ6 and 0.8 ± 0.4% forSMN2Δ6, Table I). Because we did not detect a statistically significant difference between the efficiencies ofSMN1Δ6 and SMN2Δ6splicing, we conclude that the C to T transition in SMN2does not affect the 5′ss strength of exon 7 within the context of the single intron pre-mRNA.The experiments described above indicate that the 3′ss of exons 7 and 8 compete to pair with the 5′ss of exon 6. To evaluate the importance of exon 6 nucleotides in this competition we exchanged exon 6 of SMN with exon 1 derived from β-globin to generate a heterologous substrate,hetSMN (Fig. 2 A). As summarized in Table I, quantitative analysis of the transfection assays shows that the ratio of exon 7 inclusion observed for the hetSMN pre-mRNAs are very similar to the levels observed with the wild type SMN mini-genes (Table I). We conclude that the decision to include or exclude exon 7 into the splicing pathway is independent of the nature of the upstream exon and its 5′ splice site. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the nucleotide difference inSMN2 decreases the utilization of the 3′ss but not of the 5′ss of exon 7. Interestingly, the data also suggest that the relatively minor differences in the strength of the SMN1 andSMN2 exon 7 splice sites are drastically amplified in the native cis-competition context.Antisense Oligonucleotide Application to Modulate the Competition of Exon 7 and Exon 8 Increase the Ratio of Exon 7 Inclusion in SMN2Because a greater number of SMN2 gene copies in SMA patients correlates with a milder phenotype of SMA, it has been postulated that the low amount of full-length SMN generated fromSMN2 modulates disease severity (7Coovert D.D. Le T.T. McAndrew P.E. Strasswimmer J. Crawford T.O. Mendell J.R. Coulson S.E. Androphy E.J. Prior T.W. Burghes A.H. Hum. Mol.

Genet. 1997; 16: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Alteration of theSMN2-splicing pattern to generate higher fractions of full-length SMN gene product may therefore be a promising therapeutic approach to treat SMA. Our mutational analysis suggested that the splicing machinery recognizes and processes exon 7 efficiently in the absence of a splice site choice. Therefore we reasoned that an antisense oligonucleotide directed toward the 3′ splice site ofSMN2 exon 8 could potentially tilt the balance in favor of exon 7 inclusion. As illustrated in Fig.3A, this antisense oligonucleotide strategy may also lead to intron 7 retention. However, intron 7 retention does not change the coding region for SMN because the translation stop codon is located within the last nucleotides of exon 7. Stable cell lines expressing the SMN1 and SMN2wild type mini-genes were created by G418 selection. The cells were then incubated in the presence of various antisense oligonucleotides designed to hybridize to components of the 3′ss of exon 8, the proposed branch point sequence (oligobp), the polypyrimidine tract (oligopy), or the splice site junction (oligojnct). As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, treatment of the cell lines with oligojnct, but not with oligobp (or oligopy, data not shown), led to a reproducible increase in the generation of exon 7 containing mRNA. As expected, we also detected a significant fraction of stable SMN RNA that retained intron 7. Quantitative analysis indicates that the antisense oligonucleotide application leads to a 5-fold increase in the ratio of exon 7 inclusion over exon 7 skipping. The absolute levels of exon 7 inclusion increased from 20% in the absence of antisense oligonucleotides up to 50% in the presence of the junction antisense oligonucleotide. Thus, treatment of the stable cell lines expressing the SMN2 mini-gene with the junction antisense oligonucleotide modulates splice site pairing to include exon 7. As illustrated in Fig. 4 A, the application of the antisense oligonucleotide is concentration-dependent, with an apparentKd of 20 ± 10 nm. Maximal splice site modulation is reached at ∼100 nmoligojnct. In comparison, incubation of the bp or py antisense oligonucleotides at concentrations of up to 500 nm did not lead to any measurable increase in the fraction of exon 7 inclusion (data not shown). Fig. 4 B shows a time course of the antisense oligonucleotide treatment. Modulation ofSMN2 splicing is observed within the first 7 h of oligojnct transfection and is maintained throughout the length of the experiment (72 h). Maximal efficiency was observed after 24 h of treatment, and the steady decrease in antisense activity thereafter is most likely because of the degradation of the 2′O-methyl phosphorothioate oligonucleotide. Although oligojnct manipulated the ratio of exon 7 inclusion inSMN2 pre-mRNA splicing, its effect on SMN1processing was manifested predominantly by the generation of intron 7 retaining SMN1 RNAs (data not shown). We conclude that an antisense oligonucleotide treatment directed toward the intron 7/exon 8 junction efficiently and specifically modulates the splicing pattern ofSMN2.Figure 3Antisense oligonucleotides modulateSMN2 splicing. A, strategy used to modulate SMN2 alternative splicing. An antisense oligonucleotide directed toward the intron 7/exon 8 junction reduces the recognition of the exon 8 3′ splice site. As a consequence, the splice site pairing competition between exons 7 and 8 may be tilted to favor exon 7 inclusion. The thick bars within exon 7 highlight the position of the C to T transition and the UAA translation stop codon. The gray boxes indicate the positions of the primer annealing sites. B, the addition of oligojnct (lanes 3 and 4) but not oligobp (lanes 5 and 6) modulates the efficiency of SMN2 exon 7 inclusion. The percent exon 7 inclusion and intron 7 retention are shown below each lane. Exon 7 inclusion is defined as the sum of fully spliced and intron 7 retained mRNAs. bp, base pairs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Time and concentration dependence of oligojnct antisense application.

The centromeric copy of SMN, SMN2, cannot compensate for the loss of SMN1 because the majority of SMN2 pre-mRNAs undergo differential RNA splicing. A single C to T nucleotide difference that lies within exon 7 of the SMN transcript leads to preferential exon 7 exclusion in SMN2, ultimately leading to production of a truncated and unstable peptide. Thus, the C to T transition drastically affects the efficiency and kinetics at which the splicing machinery recognizes and defines exon 7. To gain insights into the mechanisms by which the C to T transition alters exon 7 definition, we have compared the strength of theSMN1 and SMN2 exon 7 splice sites. Our data demonstrate that in the absence of competing splice sites,i.e. in the context of a single intron removal event, a 2-fold difference was observed between the 3′ splice sites ofSMN1 and SMN2. In contrast, we did not detect a difference between the 5′ splice sites. Thus, the C to T transition does not appear to drastically decrease the intrinsic strength of the exon 7 splice sites. The 2-fold variance clearly cannot account for the greater difference observed in the native context of competing exons. Although 90% of SMN1 mRNAs include exon 7, only 20% of exon 7-containing mRNAs are observed for SMN2. Assuming similar transcriptional activities, the difference in the mole number of full-length SMN mRNAs produced from each SMN locus is therefore approximately 5-fold. To evaluate these differences, it is useful to express the percentage of exon 7 inclusion by the fraction of the apparent rate constant of exon 7 inclusion (kinc) over the apparent rate constant of exon exclusion (kex). Thus, the fraction of exon 7 inclusion equalskinc/kex. Because the ratio of exon 7 inclusion is 90% for SMN1 pre-mRNA processing, the rate of exon inclusion is 9 times faster than the rate of exon skipping. In case of SMN2,kex is 5 times faster thankinc, leading to a 20% inclusion efficiency. In the context of competing exons,kinc/kex therefore changes from 9 in SMN1 to 0.2 in SMN2, a 45-fold difference. Removal of either intron 6 or intron 7 most likely commits the splicing pattern to exon 7 inclusion. Thus, changes in the rate of exon inclusion depend on the efficiency of either intron 6 or intron 7 splicing. Because our comparison of intron 6 and intron 7 removal indicates that neither process is altered by more than 2-fold, it is tempting to argue that the SMN2 characteristic exon 7 skipping phenomena arises mainly by increasing the efficiency of the competing exon exclusion reaction. Based on the above comparisons, a 2-fold decrease in the efficiency of intron 6 or intron 7 removal is expected to be accompanied by a 20-fold increase in the rate ofkex. These considerations suggest that a more efficient recognition of exonic sequences by the action of exonic splicing enhancers, for example, affect not only the rate of intron removal but also the competing rate of exon skipping. Therefore, exon definition may incorporate a mechanism that also influences rates of splice site juxtapositioning.Alternative splicing of the CD45 pre"

The predicted membrane topology of hENT1, the first identified member of the ENT family, contains 11 putative transmembrane helices (4Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E.

In protozoa, mutations of Gly183 in transmembrane helix 5 of Leishmania donovani LdNT1.1 result in altered substrate specificity and drug resistance to tubercidin (12Vasudevan G. Ullman B.

A mutant form of TbAT1 from Trypanosoma brucei brucei that confers resistance to melaminophenyl arsenicals contains six amino acid substitutions in different transmembrane helices and loops of its sequence (13Maser P.

While these studies have been successful in identifying functionally important roles for transmembrane helices 3–6 and other regions, there is currently no experimentally based model of ENT topology. Such information is essential to provide a structural basis for further molecular and mechanistic studies of ENT transporter function. One approach to test the two-dimensional orientation of integral membrane proteins is to identify sites of N-glycosylation. During protein synthesis, attachment of N-linked oligosaccharides to nascent polypeptide occurs on Asn residues in the motif Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X can be any amino acid except Pro (14Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar, 15Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Due to strict compartmentalization of enzymes, N-glycosylation is carried out exclusively on the luminal side of the endoplasmic reticulum, which is topologically equivalent to the extracellular side of the protein. Thus, it is possible to identify exofacial and endofacial segments of the protein from the N-glycosylation profile. Here, we have produced recombinant hENT1 in Xenopus oocytes and used native and engineered N-glycosylation sites in combination with immunological studies of native h/rENT1 in erythrocyes and ventricular myocytes to experimentally define the topology of this prototypical nucleoside transporter protein. When combined with computer-based sequence analyses, the results provide a unified model of membrane architecture for all eukaryotic ENT nucleoside transporters. The locations of transmembrane helices in hENT1 were predicted by analysis of the amino acid sequence using the hidden Markov model procedure of Sonnhammeret al. (16Sonnhammer E.L.L. von Heijne G.

Experiments were performed at least twice with different batches of cells. To prepare membranes (22Yao S.Y.M. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Membrane Transport. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 47-78Google Scholar), groups of 100 oocytes were lysed at 0 °C by repeated pipetting in 1 ml of ice-cold 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm EDTA, followed by centrifugation (1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) to remove nuclei, yolk granules, and melanosomes. Membranes (plasma membrane + intracellular membranes) in the supernatant were collected and washed twice by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. Protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce) using BSA as standard. Oocyte membranes (10 μg of total protein) were heated to 65 °C for 5 min in 0.5% SDS, cooled to room temperature, and digested with N-Glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Identically treated samples omitting enzyme were used as controls. Antibodies (anti-hENT1254–272) for competitive ELISA were raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide corresponding to hENT1 residues 254–272 by established methods (23Davies A. Ciardelli T.L.

The amount of free antibody remaining in 100-μl samples of the supernatants after centrifugation was then assessed by ELISA using microtitre plates coated with 2 μg/well protein-depleted membranes. Antibodies (anti-rENT1227–290) for immunocytochemistry were raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein bearing rENT1 residues 227–290 and affinity-purified on a column of immobilized cellulose binding domain fusion protein bearing the same rENT1 fragment. The antibodies labeled a single band of ∼65 kDa on immunoblots of rat heart membranes (data not shown). Freshly isolated rat ventricular myocytes fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS were incubated without or with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS to permeabilize the cell membranes, followed by blocking with 10% donkey serum in PBS. Cells were next incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml affinity-purified antibodies in PBS containing 2% BSA. Where indicated, antibodies were pretreated with an equal concentration by weight of cellulose binding domain fusion protein for 1 h before use. After washing in PBS, samples were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C with a 1:100 dilution of an fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate of donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon) in PBS containing 1% BSA and 1.5% donkey serum. After further washes in PBS, samples were mounted in Vectashield® mounting medium and examined using a Leica TCS NT laser scanning confocal microscope and LEICA software. For immunoblotting, oocyte membranes (2 μg of total protein) were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar).

Transmembrane helices are linked by short (≤16 residue) hydrophilic regions, except for those connecting transmembrane helices 1 and 2 (loop A), and transmembrane helices 6 and 7 (loop H), which contain 41 and 66 residues, respectively. Loop A is predicted to be extracellular and contains anN-glycosylation acceptor site at Asn48. Loop H is proposed to be intracellular and contains the remaining two hENT1N-glycosylation acceptor sites at Asn277 and Asn288. In the present study, we have combined computer predictions of membrane topology with glycosylation scanning mutagenesis and immunological approaches to provide an in depth analysis of the membrane topology of hENT1 and other ENT family members. Application of the TMHMM algorithm to the hENT1 amino acid sequence predicted an 11-transmembrane helix topology, with cytosolic and extracellular amino and carboxyl termini, respectively (Fig.2). This method employs a seven-state hidden Markof model for membrane proteins, and although it is applied to individual sequences, it performs with an accuracy comparable with that for multiple sequence alignment methods, correctly predicting the entire topology for 77% of the sequences in a standard dataset of 83 proteins with known topology (16Sonnhammer E.L.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Glasgow J. Littlejohn T. Major F. Lathrop R. Sankoff D. Sensen C. Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology. AAAI Press, Menlo Park, CA1998: 175-182Google Scholar). The predicted locations of the 11 transmembrane helices were almost identical to those previously deduced from hydropathic analysis (4Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y.P. Coe I.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Similarly, application of the TMAP (17Persson B. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and PHDhtm (18Rost B. Fariselli P. Casadio R. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) algorithms to the aligned sequences of hENT1 and 33 other mammalian, insect, nematode, protozoan, yeast, and plant ENT family members (3Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also led to the prediction of a common 11-transmembrane helix topology (Fig. 2). TMAP scans alignments for peaks in propensity curves for the hydrophobic and terminal regions of the transmembrane sequence spans, whereas PHDhtm uses a neural network trained with experimentally determined structures to predict transmembrane helices. Additional support for the locations of the proposed transmembrane helices was provided by the observation that both insertions and deletions were present in the aligned sequences in each of the proposed loops linking the transmembrane helices, except for loop C between transmembrane helices 4 and 5 (Fig. 2). The predicted shortness of loop C, the fact that it never naturally contains an insertion or deletion, and the observation that it contains a highly conserved Pro, suggest that it may play an important structural role in the ENT family. ENTs predicted to have an 11-transmembrane helix topology included T. brucei bruceiTbAT1, which previously has been suggested to have a 10-transmembrane helix membrane architecture (13Maser P. Sutterlin C. Kralli A. Kaminsky R. Science. 1999; 285: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Initially, hENT1 Asn48, Asn277, and Asn288 were mutated to Gln to create the three single-site mutants N48Q, N277Q, and N288Q. Glycosylation-defective mutant N48Q was then used as the recipient for introduction of novel N-glycosylation acceptor sites into the different locations of hENT1 shown in Fig. 1. For optimal glycosylation, each novel site was well spaced (greater than 11 residues) from its nearest transmembrane helix, and engineered loops were greater than 30 residues in size (27Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, artificial glycosylation sites were introduced into loops B, D, E, and H, and at the amino and carboxyl termini, resulting in constructs N48Q/loop-B, N48Q/loop-D, N48Q/loop-E, N48Q/Q246N, N48Q/N-tail, and N48Q/C-tail, respectively. The remaining external loop (loop C) was not targeted, for reasons described above. RNA transcripts for hENT1 and each of the glycosylation variants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and assayed for nucleoside transport activity (10 μm uridine influx) as described under “Experimental Procedures” (4Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y.P. Coe I.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 22Yao S.Y.M. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Membrane Transport. A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 47-78Google Scholar). N48Q/loop-B and N48Q/loop-E displayed lower levels of transport activity than hENT1, N48Q, N227Q, N288Q, N48Q/Q246N, N48Q/loop-D, N48Q/N-tail, or N48Q/C-tail and required a longer incubation period (30 min versus 5 min) to obtain comparable levels of cellular uptake. Nevertheless, all nine engineered transporters were functional, demonstrating that the native conformation was generally retained in all constructs and that the mutated transporters reached the cell surface. Representative influx values, corrected for endogenous nucleoside uptake measured in control water-injected oocytes, were 1.96 ± 0.06, 0.47 ± 0.06, 0.79 ± 0.09, 1.00 ± 0.17, 1.65 ± 0.11, 0.74 ± 0.06, 0.44 ± 0.06, and 1.87 ± 0.14 pmol/oocyte·5 min−1 for hENT1, N48Q, N227Q, N288Q, N48Q/Q246N, N48Q/loop-D, N48Q/N-tail, and N48Q/C-tail, respectively, and 1.39 ± 0.20 and 0.77 ± 0.22 pmol/oocyte·30 min−1 for N48Q/loop-B and N48Q/loop-E, respectively. N48Q was also functional inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (28Vickers M.F. Mani R.S. Sundaram M. Hogue D.L. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glycosylation status of wild-type hENT1 and each of the mutants was then examined by immunoblotting of oocyte membrane samples before and after treatment with N-Glycosidase F. Blots of membranes from oocytes producing wild-type hENT1 exhibited two characteristic immunobands: a diffuse major band centered around 55 kDa (glyco form) and a sharp minor band at about 50 kDa (aglyco form) (Fig.3 A). Similar to the native glyco form of the human erythrocyte es transporter (29Kwong F.Y.P. Davies A. Tse C.-M. Young J.D. Henderson P.J.F. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 243-249PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kwong F.W.P. Wu J.S.R. Shi M.M. Fincham H.E. Davies A. Henderson P.J.F. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22127-22134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), treatment with N-glycosidase F eliminated the 55-kDa band and increased the amount of immunostaining at 50 kDa. Since intracellular membranes (endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi) as well as plasma membrane were present in the preparation, the small amount of aglyco hENT1 seen in the absence of N-glycosidase F possibly reflects newly synthesized transporter not yet modified by sugar addition. The apparent molecular mass of aglyco hENT1 was in close agreement with that predicted from its amino acid sequence (50.2 kDa), and blots of control membranes from water-injected oocytes produced no immunoreative bands, demonstrating the specificity of the antibodies used in the study. To determine which of the three potential sites in hENT1 is actually glycosylated, the electrophoretic mobilities of mutants N48Q, N277Q, and N288Q were compared with that of wild-type hENT1. As shown in Fig. 3 A, mutants N277Q and N288Q each gave two immunobands indistinguishable from those of wild-type hENT1, indicating that both Asn277 and Asn288 were not glycosylated. Mutant N48Q, in contrast, displayed a single 50-kDa immunoband whose mobility was unaltered by treatment withN-glycosidase F. Thus, disruption of the glycosylation sequence at Asn48 abolished N-glycosylation of the protein, identifying Asn48 as the only endogenous glycosylation site of wild-type hENT1. Previous studies have shown that the glycosylation site of the native human erythrocyte estransporter is located near one of its ends (30Kwong F.W.P. Wu J.S.R. Shi M.M. Fincham H.E. Davies A. Henderson P.J.F. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22127-22134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have now identified this site as Asn48, which is close to the amino terminus, a result that agrees with our topology model in Fig. 1, which places loop A extracellularly. We fused to the amino terminus of N48Q a sequence of 13 amino acids (MTNRLDMSQNVSM) from loop A encoding the nativeN-glycosylation site of hENT1. The new acceptor site was 14 amino acids away from transmembrane helix 1. On immunoblotting, this fusion construct, N48Q/N-tail, gave a single band similar to that of N48Q. No detectable increase in protein mass was observed, and the mobility of the protein was unaffected by N-glycosidase F digestion, indicating that the amino-terminal tag had not been glycosylated (Fig. 3 B). This suggested that the amino terminus is in the cytoplasm, consistent with the orientation predicted by our topographical model. With the demonstration that Asn48 is extracellular, a cytosolic location for the amino terminus supports the prediction that the intervening hydrophobic region spans the lipid bilayer only once, giving rise to transmembrane helix 1. To test the orientation of loop B (between transmembrane helices 3 and 4), the 19-amino acid residue loop A glycosylation tag TNRLDMSQNVSLVTAELSK was engineered near the middle of this region, increasing its size to 34 residues. The resulting construct N48Q/loop-B was moderately glycosylated (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that loop B faces the extracellular side of the membrane. Support for this interpretation comes from studies of rENT2 where we have identified a unique Cys residue (Cys140) that is responsible for inhibition of this transporter by extracellular PCMBS (11Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Chomey E.G. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 387-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because Cys140 is located in the exofacial half of transmembrane helix 4, it is likely that the loop between transmembrane helices 3 and 4 in rENT2 is also extracellular. Since all ENTs share a common membrane topology, loop B of hENT1 must also be exofacial. Asn277 and Asn288, located in the carboxyl-terminal half of loop H, are not utilized by the glycosylation machinery (Fig. 3 A). To verify that the first half of this large hydrophilic region is also intracellular, a new glycosylation acceptor site was created in this region of N48Q by replacing Gln246 with Asn246, therby generating the sequence N-E-T at that position. The electrophoretic mobility of the immunoband of this double mutant N48Q/Q246N was very similar to that of N48Q both before and after N-glycosidase F treatment (Fig. 3 B), indicating the absence of glycosylation at the engineered site (Asn246). While Asn288 is probably too close to the membrane to be glycosylated, regardless of which way the loop is oriented, Asn277 and the new site Asn246 meet all known requirements for optimal glycosylation (27Landolt-Marticorena C. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, the absence of glycosylation of these two residues suggested that both halves of loop H are intracellularly oriented. If loop H faces the cytoplasm, the preceding loop linking transmembrane helices 5 and 6 (loop C) must be extracellular. Anti-hENT1254–272 serum (which recognizes a middle portion of loop H in a region between mutated residues Gln246 and Asn277) was tested in competitive ELISA experiments using unsealed human erythrocyte membranes and intact erythrocytes as the competing antigen. As shown in Fig.4, incubation of antiserum with unsealed membranes inhibited antibody binding to plate-bound antigen, reaching >75% inhibition at the highest concentration of membranes employed (50 μg). In contrast, intact erythrocytes containing equivalent amounts of integral membrane proteins had no effect. The loop H epitope for the antibodies is therefore exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the human erythrocyte membrane. The location of loop H was also assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy of fixed rat ventricular myocytes before and after permeabilization of the plasma membrane. Myocytes were chosen for study because the heart contains an abundance of the rat homolog of hENT1, rENT1. Fig. 5 A shows that fusion protein antibodies against loop H of rENT1 (anti-rENT1227–290) strongly stained the surface membranes of detergent-permeabilized rat ventricular myocytes, with particularly strong staining of the t-tubules (which are continuous with the plasmalemma) being apparent. The specificity of the staining was demonstrated by the almost total inhibition of staining caused by preincubation of the antibodies with a cellulose binding domain-fusion protein bearing a fragment of rENT1 corresponding to residues 227–290 (Fig. 5 B). Lack of staining was also evident when nonspecific rabbit IgG was employed (data not shown). In contrast to permeabilized cells, little or no staining was evident when nonpermeabilized cells were incubated with anti-rENT1227–290 (Fig. 5 C). These findings confirm the cytosolic orientation of the central hydrophilic region and are consistent with our topology model, which predicts loop H to be intracellular. Previous peptide mapping experiments with thees transporter in human erythrocyte and rat liver membranes found a common trypsin cleavage site situated in an intracellular domain at the approximate center of both proteins (30Kwong F.W.P. Wu J.S.R. Shi M.M. Fincham H.E. Davies A. Henderson P.J.F. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22127-22134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that this site is located in loop H. We then used glycosylation tags derived from loop A to investigate the orientations of loop D (between transmembrane helices 7 and 8) and loop E (between transmembrane helices 9 and 10). Accordingly, the sequences TNRLDMSQNVSLVTAELSKD (20 amino acids long) and FTNRLDMSQNVSLVTAELSKDA (22 amino acids long) were independently fused to the middle loops D and E of N48Q, respectively, expanding their sizes to 34 residues. Constructs N48Q/loop D and N48Q/loop E were glycosylated (Fig. 3 D), confirming that both loops face the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and that these regions are therefore extracellular as indicated by the topology model. The carboxyl terminus of hENT1 is predicted to be extracellular, with only four amino acids extending outside the lipid bilayer. To verify this, the 58-amino acid carboxyl terminus of rCNT1, containing two endogenous sites of glycosylation (20Hamilton S.R. Yao S.Y.M. Ingram J.C. Hadden D.A. Ritzel M.W.L. Gallagher M.P. Henderson P.J.F. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27981-27988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), was fused to that of N48Q, creating the construct N48Q/C-tail. Consistent with an extracellular orientation, the fusion protein was glycosylated (Fig.3 B). Both the glyco- and N-glycosidase F-treated forms of N48Q/C-tail migrated with sizes smaller than that expected, considering that the construct had acquired 58 extra amino acids during tag fusion. Immunoblots produced with antibodies specific for the rCNT1 carboxyl terminus (20Hamilton S.R. Yao S.Y.M. Ingram J.C. Hadden D.A. Ritzel M.W.L. Gallagher M.P. Henderson P.J.F. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27981-27988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) confirmed that the glycosylation tag from rCNT1 was present in N48Q/C-tail (Fig. 3 C). The size discrepancy must therefore have resulted from anomalous migration of the fusion protein. Glycosylation scanning mutagenesis was used to determine experimentally the orientation of seven key topographical landmarks of recombinant hENT1 membrane architecture (three in the amino-terminal half of the protein, the central cytoplasmic loop, three in the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein) and, in so doing, define the overall topology of the transporter as a whole. Together with computational approaches, the results obtained for the amino terminus (intracellular), loops A, B, D, and E (extracellular), loop H (intracellular), and the carboxyl terminus (extracellular) validated the topology model of hENT1 shown in Fig. 1 and were consistent with antibody studies, which independently established that loop H of native h/rENT1 was cytoplasmic. Sequence analyses predicted a common 11-transmembrane helix membrane architecture for hENT1 and other eukaryote ENT family members, setting the stage for detailed analysis of ENT structure and function in regions of the transporter implicated in inhibitor binding and nucleoside and nucleoside drug translocation. Since some protozoan ENTs are likely to be proton-dependent (3Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our topology model will also have relevance to molecular studies directed toward identification of transporter domains and amino acid residues involved in cation coupling. In their membrane topology, ENTs are strikingly similar to members of the GLUT family of sugar transporters, although the latter are predicted to have an additional transmembrane segment at the carboxyl terminus. For example, the human glucose transporter GLUT1 has a cytoplasmic amino terminus, a large glycosylated loop connecting transmembrane helices 1 and 2, and a large cytoplasmic loop connecting transmembrane helices 6 and 7 (23Davies A. Ciardelli T.L. Lienhard G.E. Boyle J.M. Whetton A.D. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 799-808PubMed Google Scholar). Although the ENTs and the GLUTs, which belong to the major facilitator superfamily of proteins (31Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), show no obvious sequence similarities, they do share some functional similarities. For example, in human erythrocytes that possess both hENT1 and GLUT1, the potent sugar transport inhibitors cytochalasin B and phloretin weakly inhibit uridine fluxes, while conversely the nucleoside transport inhibitor dipyridamole weakly inhibits sugar transport (32Plagemann P.G. Woffendin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 899: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Moreover, adenosine inhibits hexose transport in these cells in a concentration-dependent manner (32Plagemann P.G. Woffendin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 899: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These observations suggest similarities between the substrate/inhibitor-binding sites of the two transporters. However, it remains to be seen whether these functional and topological similarities reflect similar helix-packing arrangements and molecular mechanisms in the two groups of transporters and a possible common evolutionary origin.

One mutant showed a reduced DNA bending activity on the Fgf4enhancer (46° instead of 80°), which resulted in more powerful transactivation compared with the wild type protein. We then selected two single-base mutations in the Fgf4 enhancer that make the DNA less bendable by the Sox2 protein. Again, a different DNA bend (0° and 42° instead of 80°) resulted in a different activation of transcription, but in this case reduced bending corresponded to decreased transcription. We found that the opposite effect on transcription of similar DNA bending angles is due to a 20° difference in the relative orientation of the DNA bends, proving that a correct three-dimensional geometry of enhanceosome complexes is necessary to promote transcription.

The right combination of factors binding to specific DNA sequences ensures specificity, and the contacts between the different proteins increase the stability of the complex. However, the various transcription factors are often bound to DNA at nonadjacent sites, and direct contacts between them are possible only if they are juxtaposed through the deformation of the DNA helix. Long DNA fragments have sufficient flexibility and can form loops, bringing in close contact proteins bound to distant sites. On the contrary, fragments smaller than 500 bp1 are rather stiff (1Travers A.A. Ner S.S. Churchill M.E.A. Cell. 1994; 77: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and the formation of multiprotein complexes can require specific proteins that introduce bends in DNA. Proteins of the HMG box family have DNA bending activity and are thus expected to act as architectural factors. The HMG box family is composed of chromatin proteins and transcription factors that contain the DNA binding domain of the same name (2Bianchi M.E. Beltrame M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1573-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 3Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). All of these proteins share the ability to recognize distorted DNA structures and introduce bends in DNA. However, although chromatin proteins HMGB1 and 2 bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner (4Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), transcriptional regulators such as the sex-determining factor SRY (5Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1993; 27: 71-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) are sequence-specific. SRY is one of the best characterized DNA-bending proteins. It is encoded on the Y chromosome and promotes the development of male gonads. Through its HMG box, it recognizes sites similar to the sequence A/TAACAAA/T (6Harley V.R. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1500-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and, upon binding DNA from the minor groove, it bends it at an 83° angle (7Ferrari S. Harley V.R. Pontiggia A. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). A mutation that significantly reduces the DNA bending activity of human SRY causes sex reversal (8Pontiggia A. Rimini R. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6115-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, a direct correlation between the bending and transactivational activities of SRY could never be definitively established, because so far no SRY target gene has been identified with certainty, precluding direct experiments on transcriptional control. To prove beyond doubt that the bending activity of HMG box proteins has a functional role in the regulation of transcription, we focused our attention on Sox2. Sox (SRY-related HMG box) proteins are stage- and tissue-specific transcription factors that specify cell fate during development (9Pevny L.H. Lovell-Badge R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Sox2 contains an HMG box that recognizes and bends the same DNA sites as SRY and has a transactivation domain at its C terminus (10Collignon J. Sockanathan S. Hacker A. Cohen-Tannoudji M. Norris D. Rastan S. Stevanovic M. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Development. 1996; 122: 509-520PubMed Google Scholar). Sox2 starts to be expressed at the blastocyst stage, in the inner cell mass; there, in collaboration with the octamer-binding protein Oct-3 (11Schöler H.R. Ruppert S. Suzuki N. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Nature. 1990; 344: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), it binds to the enhancer of the Fgf4 (fibroblastgrowth factor 4) gene and determines its expression (12Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 13Ambrosetti D.-C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We generated six different mutants in the HMG box of Sox2. We found one mutant with reduced bending activity; this mutant activatesFgf4 transcription more than the wild type protein. We also mutated the Sox2 binding site and selected for single-nucleotide substitutions that render the DNA molecule stiffer toward the action of wild type Sox2; again we found that different DNA bending resulted in a different level of transcription. In this case, reduced bending decreased transcription. When we compared the complexes obtained using the mutated protein and the mutated binding site, we found a 20° difference in the relative orientation of the DNA bends. Taken together, these data prove that a correct three-dimensional geometry of nucleoprotein complexes is crucial for transcriptional activation by HMG box proteins. Plasmid pGex-Sox2.HMG was constructed by cloning into the EcoRI-SalI sites of plasmid pGex-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), a 387-bp fragment of mouse Sox2 cDNA (nucleotides 449–835; Ref. 10Collignon J. Sockanathan S. Hacker A. Cohen-Tannoudji M. Norris D. Rastan S. Stevanovic M. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Development. 1996; 122: 509-520PubMed Google Scholar) coding for the Sox2 HMG box plus 26 amino acids upstream and 24 amino acids downstream. The fragment was obtained by PCR from mouse genomic DNA using primers Sox2for (5′-GGGAATTCCAGCAAGCTTCGGGGGG-3′) and Sox2rev (5′-AAGTCGACTAGCTCGCCATGCTGTTCCC-3′). To introduce mutations in the Sox2 HMG box, pGex-Sox2.HMG was used as template in two-step PCR mutagenesis, using Sox2for and Sox2rev as external primers and six pairs of internal mutagenic primers (substi- tutions in bold type): M47Ifor: 5′-GAGGCCCATAAACGCCTTC-3′, and M47Irev: 5′-GAAGGCGTTTATGGGCCTC-3′; N48Qfor: 5′-GAGGCCCATGCAAGCCTTC-3′, and N48Qrev: 5′-GAAGGCTTGCATGGGCCTC-3′; R58Kfor: 5′-GGGGCAGAAGCGTAAGATGG-3′, and R58Krev: 5′-CCATCTTACGCTTCTGCCCC-3′; K89Ifor: 5′-GAGACCGAGATACGGCCGT-3′, and K89Irev: 5′-ACGGCCGTATCTCGGTCTC-3′; F92Sfor: 5′-CGGCCGTCCATCGACGAG-3′, and F92Srev: 5′-CTCGTCGATGGACGGCCG-3′, and Y112Ffor: 5′-CGGATTATAAATTCCGGCCGC-3′, and Y112Frev: 5′-GCGGCCGGAATTTATAATCCG-3′. The final PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI-SalI sites of pGex-4T1 to obtain the mutant pGex-Sox2.HMG plasmids. Sequences were confirmed by double-stranded sequencing. Plasmid pGex-Oct-3.POU was kindly provided by Hans Schöler (University of Pennsylvania). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The GST moiety was separated from Sox2.HMG by incubating the fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at room temperature with thrombin (final concentration, 2 units/μl in phosphate-buffered saline). The Sox2 HMG boxes (wt and mutant) released in the buffer were quantified by Coomassie staining in comparison with a known marker and stored at −80 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. The γ-32P-labeled Fgf probe was made of annealed oligonucleotides Fgf-probe.for (5′-ctagAACTCTTTGTTTGGATGCTAATGGGA-3′) and Fgf-probe.rev (5′-tcgaTCCCATTAGCATCCAAACAAAGAGTT-3′). The Fgf probe reproduces the sequence of the murine Fgf4 enhancer (14Brookes S. Smith R. Thurlow J. Dickson C. Peters G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4037-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and contains adjacent Sox2 and Oct-3 binding sites. Purified polypeptides were incorporated in the indicated amounts, in a final volume of 10 μl. Binding buffers, electrophoresis, and autoradiography were as desribed (7Ferrari S. Harley V.R. Pontiggia A. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The Oct-3 POU domain alone has a low solubility after removal of the GST moiety; thus, the binding reactions with the Oct-3 POU domain were performed by incubating, first, the Sox2 HMG box with ∼500 ng of GST-OCT-3.POU bound to glutathione-Sepharose in 8 μl of binding buffer, allowing the two proteins to interact. After 45 min at 4 °C, the probe (0.1 nm) was added together with thrombin (0.01 unit) to remove the GST, and after 40 min at room temperature the samples were applied to the gel. The amount of active protein in the preparations was determined by competitive EMSA, adding increasing quantities (0–400 nm) of unlabeled probe to binding mixture containing a small amount of labeled Fgf probe (0.1 nm) and 150 nm Sox2 HMG box. Incubation and electrophoresis were carried out as described in the previous paragraph. The radioactivity present in the bands was measured by exposing the dried gel to PhosphorImager screens (Molecular Dynamics). The concentration of active protein was deduced from the concentration of unlabeled probe that starts to displace the labeled probe. To determine the dissociation constants of the protein-DNA complexes, wt and mutant Sox2 HMG boxes were titrated into binding mixtures containing a fixed amount (0.1 nm) of probe. The samples were electrophoresed, and the radioactivity was measured as described in the previous paragraph. Under conditions of protein excess, the dissociation constant is equivalent to the concentration of polypeptide that binds 50% of the probe. For circular permutation analysis, plasmids containing wt and mutant Fgf4 enhancers (pBend2-Fgf4, pBend2-Fgf4.mut4 and pBend2-Fgf4.mut11) were prepared by insertion of annealed synthetic oligonucleotides (Bend-Fgf4: 5′-CTAGAACTCTTTGTTTGGATGCTAATGGGA-3′ and 5′-TCGATCCCATTAGCATCCAAACAAAGAGTT-3′; Bend-Fgf4.mut11: 5′-CTAGAACTCTTTATTTGGATGCTAATGGGA-3′ and 5′-TCGATCCCATTAGCATCCAAATAAAGAGTT-3′; and Ben2-Fgf4.mut4: 5′-CTAGAACTCTTTGGTTGGATGCTAATGGGA-3′ and 5′-TCGATCCCATTAGCATCCAACCAAAGAGTT-3′) between XbaI andSalI restriction sites in plasmid pBend2. Preparation of probes, electrophoresis, and data analysis were carried out as previously reported (7Ferrari S. Harley V.R. Pontiggia A. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The series of phasing vectors was constructed by cloning the oligonucleotide pairs described above into theEcoRI-SalI sites of pSB10 81–86 vectors (15Drak J. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3074-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Probes were prepared by end-labeling RsaI-PvuII fragments with 32P. Each probe was incubated in binding mixtures containing wt or N48Q Sox2 HMG box in concentrations equal to the K D of the complexes. After 10 min of incubation in ice, the samples were electrophoresed at 4 °C in 10% polyacrylamide gels at 10 V/cm for 18–20 h. The relative mobilities (complex mobility divided by probe mobility) were plotted as a function of the length of the spacer between the Sox2 binding site and the intrinsic DNA bend, and the best fit to a cosine function (phasing function) was determined (Prism software). The relative orientations of DNA bends were determined from the minima of the phasing functions. The helical periodicity was assumed to be 10.5 bp/turn of the DNA helix. Sequences recognized by the wt Sox2 HMG box, but intrinsically less bendable than the wt sequence, were selected from a pool of 131-bp DNA molecules containing mutant Sox2-binding sites in the middle of the fragment (D probe). Plasmid pBend2-Fgf4 was used as template in two-step PCR muta- genesis using as external primers bend.for (5′-AGATATCCAGCTGCCC-3′) and bend.rev (5′-GGATATCTTTAAACTCGAG-3′) and a pair of degenerated primers, where one nucleotide of the Sox2 binding site was individually substituted by the other three nucleotides: fgf1, CTAGAACTCVTTGTTTGG and CCAAACAABGAGTTCTAG; fgf2, CTAGAACTCTVTGTTTGG and CCAAACABAGAGTTCTAG; fgf3, GAACTCTTVGTTTGGATG and CCAAACBAAGAGTTCTAG; fgf4, GAACTCTTTHTTTGGATG and CATCCAAADAAAGAGTTC; fgf5, GAACTCTTTGVTTGGATG and CATCCAABCAAAGAGTTC; fgf6, AACTCTTTGTVTGGATGC and CATCCABACAAAGAGTTC; and fgf7, CTTTGTTVGGATGCTAATG and CATTAGCATCCBAACAAAG, where H = A/C/T, B = C/G/T, V = A/C/G, andD = A/T/G. The seven PCR products were mixed together, obtaining a pool of 21 different DNA molecules containing mutant Sox2 binding sites in the middle. The pool was end-labeled with 32P and used as probe in a band shift assay with wt Sox2 HMG box in the conditions described above. After autoradiography, shifted bands corresponding to lower mobility complexes were cut out from the gel, and DNA was electroeluted and reamplified by PCR. The PCR product was end-labeled with32P and used again as probe in a band shift assay. Four rounds of selection/amplification were performed to enrich the pool of less bendable molecules, and finally the molecules were cloned into theEcoRV restriction site of pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced. Two of the mutations (mut4 and mut11) were inserted into pBend2-Fgf4 and tested in circular permutation assays. Plasmid pT81-Fgf4 was constructed by cloning into the BamHI-KpnI sites of pT81-luc (ATCC) a 286-bp fragment (nucleotides 2939–3224) containing the Fgf4 enhancer (14Brookes S. Smith R. Thurlow J. Dickson C. Peters G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4037-4045Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), obtained by PCR from mouse genomic DNA with primers enhFgf.for (5′-GCGGATCCTTAGCTCGCTTCAGG-3′) and enhFgf.rev: (5′-GCGGTACCGAGCCACCAGACAGAAAG-3′). To introduce in the Fgf4en- hancer the nucleotide substitutions that decrease DNA flexibility, pT81-Fgf4 was used as template in two-step PCR mutagenesis using enhFgf.for and enhFgf.rev together with the two oligonucleotide pairs mut4 (5′-GAAAACTCTTTGGTTGGATGC-3′ and 5′-CTTTTGAGAAACCAACCTACG-3′) and mut11 (5′-GAAAACTCTTTATTTGGATGC-3′ and 5′-CTTTTGAGAAATAAACCTACG-3′). The final PCR products were cloned intoBamHI-KpnI sites of pT81-luc, obtaining the pT81-Fgf4mut4 and pT81-Fgf4mut11. Plasmid pSG5-Sox2 was constructed by cloning into the BamHI site of pSG5 (Stratagene) a 977-bp fragment (nucleotides 406–1383) corresponding to the Sox2 coding region (10Collignon J. Sockanathan S. Hacker A. Cohen-Tannoudji M. Norris D. Rastan S. Stevanovic M. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Development. 1996; 122: 509-520PubMed Google Scholar). To construct variants of pSG5-Sox2, HindIII-SacII fragments obtained from each mutant pGex-Sox2.HMG were cloned into the same sites of wt pSG5-Sox2, substituting the wt sequence. HeLa and 3T3 cells (∼1.5 × 105 cells in a 6-cm dish) were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with various combinations of reporter plasmids (pT81-Fgf4, pT81-Fgf4mut4, and pT81-Fgf4mut11), wt and mutant Sox2 expression plasmids, and pCMV-OCT3. PGK-β-gal was used as normalizing vector. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 9 μg with empty pBluescript. The amounts of plasmids used in each experiment are reported in the legends of the figures. The DNA binding and bending activities of HMG box proteins are completely specified by their HMG box. We therefore studied the interaction between the Sox2 HMG box and its cognate DNA target site. We generated six point mutations within the HMG box to find mutant proteins that bend DNA with different angles. The sequences of Sox2 and SRY HMG boxes are very similar (about 85% identity); we then used the structure of the human SRY HMG box-DNA complex (16Werner M.H. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A. Clore G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) as a model to identify the Sox2 residues involved in contacts to DNA. In SRY, five amino acids (Met-64, Asn-65, Phe-67, Ile-68, and Trp-98) form a T-shaped wedge in direct contact with the central base pairs of the DNA binding site. They mediate the widening of the minor groove and the bending of the helix toward the major groove. Mutation of Met-64 alters DNA bending and causes sex reversal (8Pontiggia A. Rimini R. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6115-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We generated in Sox2 the mutations M47I, K89I, and F92S, which correspond to SRY mutations that cause sex reversal; we also selected in Sox2 Asn-48, adjacent to Met-47; Tyr-112, corresponding to a SRY residue that contacts the 5′ part of the binding site; and Arg-58, which corresponds to a SRY residue that forms salt bridges to the phosphate backbone. These residues were replaced by conservative substitutions (Asn to Gln, Arg to Lys, and Tyr to Phe) to avoid radical modifications of the protein-DNA interaction surfaces. We produced wt and mutant HMG boxes in E. coli (see “Experimental Procedures”), and we tested in vitro their DNA binding and bending activities. We then determined the dissociation constant (K D) of the DNA-protein complexes formed by the wt and mutant Sox2 HMG boxes with the Fgf4 enhancer (only the concentration of active protein was considered). The seven polypeptides were titrated on a limiting amount of probe; K D is equal to the concentration of active protein that binds 50% of the probe. Fig. 1 shows titrations with wt HMG box and mutant N48Q; the K D values of all polypeptides are summarized in Table I. TheK D determined for wt Sox2 HMG box (1.5 × 10−8m) is similar to those estimated for SRY and other Sox proteins (8Pontiggia A. Rimini R. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6115-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 17Connor F. Wright E. Denny P. Koopman P. Ashworth A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 17: 3365-3372Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The DNA affinities of mutants M47I, K89I, F92S, and Y112F were indistinguishable from that of the wt, whereas mutants N48Q and R58K showed 8- and 12-fold reductions, respectively. Thus, all of the mutants bind the Fgf4 target site, and only two have slightly reduced affinity.Table IDNA affinity and bending activity of Sox2 mutantsSox2 HMG boxK DAnglemdegreesWild type1.5 × 10−880M47I1.8 × 10−880N48Q12 × 10−846R58K18 × 10−880K89I3 × 10−880F92S0.9 × 10−880Y112F1.2 × 10−880 Open table in a new tab The effect of the mutations on the DNA bending activity was assayed by circular permutation analysis (CPA). This is a standard method to investigate distortions in DNA, based on the observation that a fragment containing a bend near the end migrates faster than a fragment with a bend in the middle (18Wu H.-M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). The Fgf4 binding site was cloned into the pBend2 vector between two repeated 121-bp units, and seven circularly permutated fragments were obtained by restriction enzyme digestion (Fig. 2 A) and used in EMSA as probes with wt and mutant HMG boxes. On the basis of three independent experiments we estimated that wt Sox2 induces an 80° deviation of the DNA axis from linearity. This value is close to that determined for SRY (83°; Ref. 7Ferrari S. Harley V.R. Pontiggia A. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Mutants M47I, R58K, K89I, F92S, and Y112F distort DNA exactly as the wt protein, whereas N48Q is significantly different (46°; Fig. 2 B). A summary of the biochemical properties of the seven polypeptides is presented in Table I. The transcriptional activation of Fgf4 gene is mediated by the synergistic action of Sox2 and Oct-3 (12Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 13Ambrosetti D.-C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The two proteins bind contiguous target sites in the Fgf4enhancer and interact with each other through the POU domain and the HMG box. We then checked the influence of Oct-3 on the DNA binding and bending activities of the Sox2 HMG box. Titration and circular permutation experiments were performed again in the presence of the Oct-3 DNA-binding region, composed by the POU-specific domain and the POU homeodomain. In these conditions, a ternary complex is formed by the Sox2 HMG box, the Oct-3 POU domain, and DNA. The apparent DNA binding affinity of both wt and N48Q HMG box is increased by the presence of the Oct-3 POU domain (data not shown). On the other hand, Oct-3 has little effect on the DNA bending activity of Sox2 (Fig. 3). Two additional sets of bands appear. The middle one corresponds to HMG box-POU domain-DNA complexes, and the upper one corresponds to two HMG boxes bound to DNA. The bending angle calculated for the ternary complex (77°) is very close to that estimated for the HMG box-DNA complex (80°). We conclude that the bending activity of Sox2 is not significantly affected by Oct-3. We then correlated the N48Q bending activity with its transcriptional activity. 3T3 and HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with fixed amounts of Oct-3 expressing vector and a reporter plasmid driven by the Fgf4 enhancer (Fig. 4 A), together with increasing amounts of expression vectors for either wt or N48Q Sox2 (full-length proteins). Wt Sox2 determines, at the maximum level, a 7-fold induction of luciferase expression (Fig. 4 B), whereas the mutant N48Q reaches a 21-fold induction. At low concentrations, N48Q is actually less effective than the wt protein, and this is probably due to its reduced DNA binding affinity. At high concentrations, all DNA target sites are presumably saturated even by the mutant, and differences in the binding affinities become irrelevant, whereas the transcriptional activities must depend exclusively on the bending activity of Sox2. We conclude that the bending activity of Sox2 affects transcriptional control directly. To further confirm the correlation between DNA bending and transcription, we used a complementary approach. We generated a population of mutated Sox2 binding sites (Fig. 5 A) by substituting individually every nucleotide to find DNA molecules that are intrinsically stiffer and less bendable by wild type Sox2 protein. By PCR we obtained a mixed population of 131-bp fragments containing the mutated Sox2 binding sites in the middle, and we used it as probe in EMSA with wt Sox2. Because of the position of the site, the migration of DNA-protein complexes is very sensitive to differences in the bending angle. We recovered from the gel the complexes with higher mobility than the wt sequence, containing less distorted DNA fragments. After several cycles of selection and amplification we ended up with fragments with reduced bendability that were cloned and sequenced. The mutant sequences were inserted in the pBend-Fgf4 plasmid and compared in CPA. Mutant 11 substitutes the fourth nucleotide of the binding site (A instead of G), and this change abolishes distortion by Sox2 (Fig. 5 C). In mutant 4 the fifth nucleotide is G instead of a T, and this reduces the bending induced by wt Sox2 to 46° (Fig. 5 B). By itself, this result confirms that the DNA sequence determines the general architecture of nucleoprotein complexes, and even slight variations can affect severely the overall geometry. We then tested whether a different DNA bend (obtained through modification of the binding site rather than the mutation of the binding protein) could result in a difference in transcription. The nucleotide substitutions reducing DNA flexibility (mut4 and mut11) were inserted in the reporter plasmid pT81-Fgf4 and tested in transient co-transfections of wt Sox2 and Oct-3. Fig. 6 shows that a different DNA bend determines a different activation of transcription. In this case, a smaller distortion leads to a reduced activation rather than an increase as seen with N48Q Sox2 protein. The planar angles formed by wt Sox2 protein on the mut4 site and by N48Q Sox2 protein on the wt site are similar, as measured by CPA. To unravel this apparent paradox we made the hypothesis that the three-dimensional geometries of the complexes N48Q/Fgf4 and wtSox2/Fgf4mut4 were different. CPA is a good tool to detect general protein-induced perturbations of DNA, including static bending, increased DNA flexibility, and aberrant protein structures; however, it gives no information concerning the direction of the DNA bend. A more specific method for the study of protein-directed bends is phasing analysis, which allows delineation of the direction of a DNA distortion in space (19Zinkel S.S. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Phasing analysis utilizes as probes in EMSA DNA fragments having an intrinsic bend at different distances from the site of induced bending. The spacing between the intrinsic and the induced bends is incrementally varied over one turn of the DNA helix (Fig. 7 A); thus, there is a spacing where the two bends are in phase and form a complementary larger angle and a spacing where the two bends are out of phase and have the effect of straightening the DNA fragment. The mobility of the complexes in a polyacrylamide gel is slowest when the two bends add up (cis-isomer) and highest when the two bends counteract each other (trans-isomer). We compared by phasing analysis the complexes wtSox2/Fgf4, N48Q/Fgf4, and wtSox2/Fgf4mut4 (Fig. 7 B). We plotted the relative mobilities of the complexes as a function of the linker length (Fig. 7 C), and we determined for each complex the spacer length that gives the lowest complex mobility. The minima for N48Q/Fgf4 and for wtSox2/Fgf4 are indistinguishable, indicating that the bends point in the same direction. On the contrary, a significant change was observed in the case of wtSox2/Fgf4mut4, the spacer length giving the cis isomer differs by 0.6 bp in comparison with wtSox2/Fgf4. Assuming an average of 10.5 bp/turn of the DNA helix, this corresponds to a 20° difference in the relative orientations of the DNA bends. These data prove that the mutations in Sox2 protein (N48Q) and the Fgf4 enhancer (mut4) determine different alterations in the architecture of the corresponding nucleoprotein complexes, compared with the wt complex. In this study we investigated the role of the bending activity of the Sox2 transcription factor in the transcriptional activation of theFgf4 gene. We first quantified the affinity of the Sox2 HMG box to its target site. The estimated K D = 1.5 × 10−8m indicates a quite strong DNA binding activity, comparable with that observed for other HMG box transcription factors, such as SRY, LEF1, and Sox5 (8Pontiggia A. Rimini R. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6115-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Giese K. Amsterdam A. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2567-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21Connor F. Cary P.D. Read C.M. Preston N.S. Driscoll P.C. Denny P. Crane-Robinson C. Ashworth A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3339-3346Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We then calculated that, upon binding, the HMG box induces an 80° distortion of the DNA double helix. We also proved that Oct-3, which cooperates with Sox2 inFgf4 regulation, does not affect the DNA bending activity of Sox2. These results indicate that the interactions with DNA of SRY and Sox2 are similar. Taking advantage of this similarity, we introduced mutations into the Sox2 HMG box that were presumed to alter its DNA bending activity, using SRY as a guide. The most dramatic effect was obtained by substituting Asn-48 with Gln (N48Q mutant); the bending activity was strongly reduced. The substituted Asn corresponds to one of the five amino acids of SRY that enter into the minor groove and induce the distortion of the DNA helix (16Werner M.H. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A. Clore G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The side chain of this Asn is involved in hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions with the fourth and fifth base pairs of the binding site. The Asn → Gln substitution adds a methylene group to the side chain, increases its bulk, and thus affects the induced DNA bending. The DNA binding affinity is also reduced 8-fold. An unexpected result came from mutant M47I. In SRY, the corresponding substitution causes a reduction in the bending activity of the protein, which phenotypically results in sex reversal (8Pontiggia A. Rimini R. Harley V.R. Goodfellow P.N. Lovell-Badge R. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6115-6124Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The mutation in Sox2, on the contrary, has no effect. This is even more surprising if we consider that the adjacent Asn is indeed involved in DNA bending. Obviously, the fine details of the interactions of SRY and Sox with DNA are not completely identical. Our goal was to prove that the ability of Sox2 to activate transcription is dependent on its ability to bend DNA. Indeed we found that the reduction of the bending activity in mutant N48Q determines a 3-fold increase of the protein transactivation potential, indicating that at least one of the mechanisms used by Sox2 to promote transcription is based on its capacity to manipulate DNA geometry. At first glance, the finding that reduced bending corresponds to increased transcription seems surprising. A similar result, however, was found in the case of IHF, an E. coli protein that activates transcription at several promoters by inducing a 180° DNA bend, thus promoting DNA-RNA polymerase interactions (22Rice P.A. Yang S. Mizuuchi K. Nash H.N. Cell. 1996; 87: 1295-1306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In a random mutation screening, mutants of IHF that maximize transcriptional activation were identified; a reduction in the bending activity corresponded to stronger activation (23Engelhorn M. Geiselmann J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional models showed that wt IHF bends DNA more sharply than is necessary for DNA back looping to occur, and the optimal bending angle is much less than the 180° turn imposed by wt IHF. Even though the molecular mechanisms underlying IHF- and Sox2-mediated transactivation are different, our data can have a similar explanation; the distortion induced by wt Sox2 might be larger than optimal to promote contacts among the proteins involved inFgf4 transactivation. One might ask why evolution selected a protein that is nonoptimal in its capacity for transcriptional activation. Sox2 regulates expression of γ- and δ-crystallin in the lens (24Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Collignon J. Lovell-Badge R. Kondoh H. Development. 1998; 125: 2521-2535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), osteopontin during hypoblast formation (25Botquin V. Hess H. Fuhrmann G. Anastassidis C. Gross M.K. Vriend G. Schöler H.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2073-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and probably several other genes. The expression of different genes might have different architectural demands, and the entity of the distortion imposed by wt Sox2 is possibly a compromise that allows a sufficient expression of all its target genes. A different explanation is also possible; an increased expression of Fgf4 is not necessarily an advantage for the organism. Fgf4 is a secreted protein that acts within complex regulatory pathways, in which intracellular and extracellular signals cooperate to define the body plan of the embryo (26Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). IncreasedFgf4 expression could disrupt the delicate equilibrium that regulates intercellular communication. In the second part of our work, we confirmed the relation between DNA bending and transcriptional activity by modulating DNA flexibility. The sequence of the Sox2 binding site affects the flexibility of the DNA molecule; single nucleotide substitutions reduce (mut4) or completely abolish (mut11) the ability of wt Sox2 protein to distort DNA. The mut4 sequence is bent by wt Sox2 by an angle similar to the one produced by the mutant N48Q protein on the wild type sequence, as measured by CPA. Unexpectedly, the substitutions in the protein and in the DNA site had opposite effects on transcription. We explained this apparent paradox by means of phasing analysis; we found that the mutations in the protein and in the binding sites affect the three-dimensional geometry of the DNA-protein complex in different ways. In particular, the orientation of the directed DNA bend induced by N48Q is essentially identical to that induced by wt Sox2. On the contrary, when mut4 is bound by the wt protein, the bend points 20° away from the direction of the wild type bend, most likely preventing the correct assembly of the nucleoprotein complex on the Fgf4 enhancer. In conclusion, in this work we have directly confirmed the hypothesis that an essential component of the action of Sox proteins is DNA bending. Furthermore, such bending must be precise both in amplitude and in direction to provide a correct framework for the rest of the transcriptional machinery to operate. We thank Dr. H. R. Schöler for providing reagents. We are very grateful to Dr. S. Guazzi for preliminary experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1975638761,"Variants of the pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit (E1; EC 1.2.4.1) of the Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex with Y177A and Y177F substitutions were created. Both variants displayed pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex activity at levels of 11% (Y177A E1) and 7% (Y177F E1) of the parental enzyme. TheK m values for thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) were 1.58 μm (parental E1) and 6.65 μm (Y177A E1), whereas the Y177F E1 variant was not saturated at 200 μm. According to fluorescence studies, binding of ThDP was unaffected by the Tyr177 substitutions. The ThDP analogs thiamin 2-thiazolone diphosphate (ThTDP) and thiamin 2-thiothiazolone diphosphate (ThTTDP) behaved as tight-binding inhibitors of parental E1 (K i = 0.003 μm for ThTDP andK i = 0.064 μm for ThTTDP) and the Y177A and Y177F variants. This analysis revealed that ThTDP and ThTTDP bound to parental E1 via a two-step mechanism, but that ThTDP bound to the Y177A variant via a one-step mechanism. Binding of ThTDP was affected and that of ThTTDP was unaffected by substitutions at Tyr177. Addition of ThDP or ThTDP to parental E1 resulted in similar CD spectral changes in the near-UV region. In contrast, binding of ThTTDP to either parental E1 or the Y177A and Y177F variants was accompanied by the appearance of a positive band at 330 nm, indicating that ThTTDP was bound in a chiral environment. In combination with x-ray structural evidence on the location of Tyr177, the kinetic and spectroscopic data suggest that Tyr177 has a role in stabilization of some transition state(s) in the reaction pathway, starting with the free enzyme and culminating with the first irreversible step (decarboxylation), as well as in reductive acetylation of the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase component. Variants of the pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit (E1; EC 1.2.4.1) of the Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex with Y177A and Y177F substitutions were created. Both variants displayed pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex activity at levels of 11% (Y177A E1) and 7% (Y177F E1) of the parental enzyme. TheK m values for thiamin diphosphate (ThDP) were 1.58 μm (parental E1) and 6.65 μm (Y177A E1), whereas the Y177F E1 variant was not saturated at 200 μm. According to fluorescence studies, binding of ThDP was unaffected by the Tyr177 substitutions. The ThDP analogs thiamin 2-thiazolone diphosphate (ThTDP) and thiamin 2-thiothiazolone diphosphate (ThTTDP) behaved as tight-binding inhibitors of parental E1 (K i = 0.003 μm for ThTDP andK i = 0.064 μm for ThTTDP) and the Y177A and Y177F variants. This analysis revealed that ThTDP and ThTTDP bound to parental E1 via a two-step mechanism, but that ThTDP bound to the Y177A variant via a one-step mechanism. Binding of ThTDP was affected and that of ThTTDP was unaffected by substitutions at Tyr177. Addition of ThDP or ThTDP to parental E1 resulted in similar CD spectral changes in the near-UV region. In contrast, binding of ThTTDP to either parental E1 or the Y177A and Y177F variants was accompanied by the appearance of a positive band at 330 nm, indicating that ThTTDP was bound in a chiral environment. In combination with x-ray structural evidence on the location of Tyr177, the kinetic and spectroscopic data suggest that Tyr177 has a role in stabilization of some transition state(s) in the reaction pathway, starting with the free enzyme and culminating with the first irreversible step (decarboxylation), as well as in reductive acetylation of the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase component. pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex pyruvate dehydrogenase dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase thiamin diphosphate thiamin 2-thiazolone diphosphate thiamin 2-thiothiazolone diphosphate 6-DCPIP, 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol The Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex (PDHc)1 consists of three subunits, pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1; EC 1.2.4.1), dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2; EC 2.3.1.12), and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3; EC 1.8.1.4), and converts the product of glycolysis (pyruvate) to acetyl-CoA. The E1 subunit catalyzes the thiamin diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent decarboxylation of pyruvate to 2α-hydroxyethylidene-ThDP, which in turn undergoes reductive acetyl transfer to formS-acetyldihydrolipoamide-E2. ThDP and Mg2+ are essential cofactors that appear also to be involved in the hysteretic regulation of E1 activity (1Bisswanger H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Yi J. Nemeria N.S. McNally A. Jordan F. Machado R.S. Guest J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33192-33200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The E1 component of E. coli PDHc comprises two identical subunits with molecular masses of 99,474 Da each (3Stephens P.E. Darlison M.G. Lewis H.M. Guest J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since the early publication by Gutowski and Lienhard (4Gutowski J.A. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2863-2866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the thiamin 2-thiazolone diphosphate (ThTDP) and thiamin 2-thiothiazolone diphosphate (ThTTDP) analogs of ThDP have been considered to be “transition state” analog-type inhibitors of the ThDP-dependent decarboxylations. The structural similarity of these C-2=O and C-2=S bonds, with the expected bond polarizations, to the 2α-hydroxyethylidene-ThDP (the enamine) intermediate and the transition state preceding it, i.e. the decarboxylation step, was noted. Although ThTDP and ThTTDP are indeed potent inhibitors of E. coli PDHc, these compounds do not appear to be particularly notable inhibitors of several other ThDP enzymes: yeast transketolase (5Shreve D.S. Holloway M.P. Haggerty III, J.C. Sable H.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12405-12408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), wheat germ pyruvate decarboxylase (6Kluger R. Gish G. Kauffman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8960-8965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and E. coli pyruvate oxidase (7O'Brien T.A. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3302-3307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A fluorescence titration of brewers' yeast apopyruvate decarboxylase by ThDP and ThTTDP revealed that ThTTDP is not a transition state analog of this enzyme (8Jordan F. Akinyosoye O. Dikdan G. Kudzin Z. Kuo D. Thiamin Pyrophosphate Biochemistry. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1988: 79-92Google Scholar). ThTTDP is, however, a slow- and tight-binding inhibitor of the human E1 enzyme (9Tripatara A. Korotchkina L.G. Patel M.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 39-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Equipped with an excellent overexpression system for the E1 subunit, we decided to reexamine this issue, in part, to determine whether any special structural features of E. coli PDHc E1 are responsible for the highly specific inhibition. We now present data indicating that the kinetics of inhibition of E. coli PDHc E1 by ThTDP and ThTTDP reflect properties of tight-binding reversible inhibitors. The recently solved three-dimensional structure of E. coliPDHc E1 revealed the presence of a tyrosine (Tyr177) near the ThDP site, in a highly conserved region of the bacterial E1 subunits. 2P. Arjunan, N. Nemeria, A. Brunskill, K. Chandrasekhar, M. Sax, Y. Yan, F. Jordan, J. R. Guest, and W. Furey, submitted for publication. Tyrosine residues involved in ThDP binding were also identified in the crystal structures of human branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (11Evarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.T.

Therefore, the Y177A and Y177F variants of E. coli PDHc E1 were created, and the binding of ThTDP and ThTTDP to parental E1 and the Y177A and Y177F variants was studied using progress curve analysis, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results indicate that Tyr177 in E. coli PDHc E1 probably interacts with the covalent adduct(s) formed with ThDP during the reaction cycle, but not with ThDP itself. Finally, we report the observation and characterization of a new CD signature, never before reported, formed upon binding of ThTTDP to either the PDHc or the E1 subunit. E. coli strain JRG3456 (aceE mutant with a chloramphenicol resistance cassette in the aceE gene, whereas the E2 and E3 genes are intact; provided by the University of Sheffield) transformed with pGS878 was used for overexpression of theaceE gene encoding the E1 subunit of E. coliPDHc. Plasmid DNA was purified according to the Wizard 373 DNA purification system (Promega). Mutagenesis reactions were carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Polymerase chain reaction was carried out for 16 cycles in a mini-cycler (MJ Research, Inc.) using double-stranded pGS878 DNA, two synthetic mutagenic primers complementary to opposite strands of the DNA, and the reagents supplied with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The following synthetic oligonucleotides (and their complements) were used as mutagenic primers (mismatched bases are underlined, and mutant codons are shown in boldface type): 5′-TGGCCTCTCTTCCTTTCCGCACCCGA-3′ (for Y177F) and 5′-TGGCCTCTCTTCC GC TCCGCACCCGA-3′ (for Y177A). The presence of mutations was verified by sequencing the entire E1 gene with the following specific primers, using the ABI Prism Ready-Reaction dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences): pdhe1, 5′-CGGCCAAGCTTACTCCCCATCC-3′; pdhe2, 5′-GAGTATCCGGGTAATCTGGAACTGGAAC-3′; pdhe3, 5′-CAGTTCCCGACCGTATCTATGGGTC-3′; pdhe4, 5′-CGTAAGGATACCAGCGGTAAACTGATCC-3′; pdhe5, 5′-GAACATGGACGGTGTGCGTCATATC-3′; pdhe6, 5′-CAGCCCGAACGGTCAGCAGTACAC-3′; pdhe7, 5′-CTGACTATCCCGAACTGTATCTCTTACGACC-3′; and pdhe8, 5′-GATTGTGAACGCTGGAACATGCTGC-3′. E. coli cells transformed with the corresponding plasmids were grown for 16 h at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and were used to inoculate 1000 ml of the same medium. The cells were grown toA 650 = 0.6–0.7 and then induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mmfinal concentration), harvested after 5–6 h, washed with 20 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0), and stored at −20 °C. Purification of parental E1 and the tyrosine variants was carried out following the protocol described previously (14Nemeria N. Volkov A. Brown A. Yi J. Zipper L. Guest J.R. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). E1 was also resolved from a single-lipoyl domain PDHc as reported previously (2Yi J. Nemeria N.S. McNally A. Jordan F. Machado R.S. Guest J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33192-33200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This was carried out following previously described procedures (6Kluger R. Gish G. Kauffman G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8960-8965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Gutowski J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 62: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Orthophosphoric acid (85%, 5 ml in a 50-ml round-bottom flask) was polymerized by heating until the solution became faintly cloudy. Upon cooling to room temperature, a clear syrupy liquid resulted, to which was added thiamin 2-thiothiazolone (1.0 g). This mixture was then heated at 100 °C for 15 min while being stirred with a glass rod and cooled to room temperature. A mixture of 4 ml of water and 1 ml of phosphoric acid was added, and the mixture was stirred for 2 h. Next, the pH was adjusted to 2.0 with 6n NaOH, and the solution was applied to a column of Amberlite CG-50 H+ cation-exchange resin and eluted with water, with the fractions being monitored by TLC on cellulose plates. A 10:1:6 mixture of EtOH, n-BuOH, and 0.5 m sodium citrate (pH 4) was used to develop the plates. Three spots were detected on TLC with R F values of 0.76, 0.68, and 0.41 for thiamin 2-thiothiazolone, thiamin 2-thiothiazolone monophosphate, and ThTTDP, respectively. 1H NMR (D2O) δ 2.26 (3H, s), 2.50 (3H, s), 3.15 (2H, t), 4.20 (2H, t), 5.40 (2H, s), and 7.58 (1H, s); 31P NMR (D2O versus phosphoric acid) δ −3.20 (α) and −12.9 (β). The synthesis of ThTDP was similar to that of ThTTDP described above. Three spots were detected by TLC with R F values of 0.89, 0.67, and 0.50 for thiamin 2-thiazolone, thiamin 2-thiazolone monophosphate, and ThTDP, respectively. 1H NMR (D2O/DCl) 2.25 (3H, s), 2.70 (3H, s), 3.10 (2H, br), 4.20 (2 H, br), and 7.85 (1 H, s); 31P NMR (D2Oversus phosphoric acid) δ −3.18 (α) and −13.93 (β). The E1 activity was measured by reconstituting holo-PDHc activity with added E2·E3 subcomplex (the molar ratio of E1 to E2·E3 subcomplex was 1:5) using a Varian DMS 300 spectrophotometer or a Cobas-Bio centrifugal analyzer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), monitoring the pyruvate-dependent reduction of NAD+ at 340 nm. The reaction medium contained (in a 1-ml (DMS 300) or 0.25-ml (Cobas Bio) test volume) 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmMgCl2, 2 mm sodium pyruvate, 2.5 mmNAD+, 0.1–0.2 mm CoA, 0.2 mm ThDP, and 2.6 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding CoA. Steady-state velocities were taken from the linear portion of the progress curve. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of NADH produced (μmol/min/mg of E1). The E1 activity was also measured in the model reaction with 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (2,6-DCPIP) using a Varian DMS 300 spectrophotometer by monitoring the reduction of 2,6-DCPIP at 600 nm. The reaction medium contained (in a 1-ml test volume) 50 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.0), 1 mmMgCl2, 2.0 mm sodium pyruvate or 0.2 mm 2α-hydroxyethyl-ThDP as substrate, 0.2 mm ThDP, and 0.1 mm 2,6-DCPIP at 30 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding the enzyme. One unit of activity is defined as the amount of 2,6-DCPIP reduced (μmol/min/mg of E1). ThTDP and ThTTDP were dissolved in 20 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.0), and their concentrations were determined using ε235 = 10,600m−1 cm−1 for ThTDP and ε319 = 10,900 m−1cm−1 for ThTTDP (4Gutowski J.A. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2863-2866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parental E1 (0.035–0.10 μm) and the tyrosine variants (0.22–0.44 μm) were incubated in 50 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.0) with 2 mmMgCl2 and 0.002–3.5 μm ThTDP or 0.005–3.5 μm ThTTDP in a total volume of 0.2 ml at 25 °C. After 30 min, the E2·E3 subcomplex and all components required for assaying the PDHc activity were added to a volume of 1.0 ml, and the reaction was started by the addition of CoA. CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv Model 202 CD spectrometer at 25 °C. A 1-cm path length quartz cuvette was used for the near-UV region (250–350 nm). Data were collected at a wavelength step of 1.0 nm, an integration time of 1 s, and a bandwidth of 1 nm. The instrument was calibrated using (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid as a reference standard. The CD signal was recorded as [Θ], where [Θ] is the ellipticity measured in millidegrees. Prior to the CD experiment, parental E1 and its tyrosine variants were chromatographed on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 10 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) to exclude ThDP. For recording CD spectra, parental E1 (1.5 mg/ml) and the tyrosine variants (0.33–1.8 mg/ml) were dissolved in 10 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing 1 mmMgCl2 and variable concentrations of ThTDP or ThTTDP. The base line was normally recorded using 10 mmKH2PO4. Data fitting and calculations utilized the KaleidaGraph, SigmaPlot, and DeltaGraph computer programs. The fluorescence spectra of parental E1 and its tyrosine variants were recorded at 25 °C using an SLM8100 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 290 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded in the 300–450-nm range in 3-ml quartz cuvettes. The integration time was 0.5 s, and the scan rate was 1 nm/min. The concentration of parental E1 and its tyrosine variants was 0.05 mg/ml in 20 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.0). The excitation and emission monochromator slit widths were 4 nm. The inner filter effect was corrected with the absorption spectrum of ThDP, ThTDP, or ThTTDP with Equation 1 (16Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy, Chapter 10.

Site-directed substitutions were introduced into the E. coli E1 subunit at Tyr177 in the highly conserved region of bacterial E1 (see BLAST alignment in Fig.1), and the Y177A and Y177F variants were created (Table I). Furthermore, a BLAST search for short nearly exact matches did not reveal any related sequences in the heterotetrameric α2β2 E1 subunits, so the highly conserved sequence in Fig. 1 is present only in the α2 homodimers. The activities of parental E1 and the Y177A and Y177F variants measured with different assays are presented in Table I. After reconstitution with the E2·E3 subcomplex, compared with parental E1, the Y177A variant retained 11% and the Y177F variant retained 7% activity according to the overall PDHc reaction assay in the presence of 0.2 mm ThDP. The catalytic constant (k cat) was ∼10-fold lower for the Y177A variant compared with the value for parental E1 (Table I). Similar relative activity (7%) was obtained for the Y177A variant using 4,4′-dithiodipyridine as a substitute for the E2 in PDHc, an E1-specific assay developed in this laboratory (data not shown) (19McNally A.J. Motter K. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19736-19743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). According to the 2,6-DCPIP assay (a different E1-specific assay that measures E1 activity in the absence of the E2·E3 subcomplex as a second substrate and that is used extensively in the study of ThDP-dependent enzymes (9Tripatara A.

Chem. 1999; 7: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar)), compared with parental E1, the activities were 20% (Y177A E1) and 49% (Y177F E1) with pyruvate as substrate and 49% (Y177A E1) and 68% (Y177F E1) with 2α-hydroxyethyl-ThDP as substrate. These results suggest that both the interaction of E1 with the E2·E3 subcomplex and, to a lesser extent, the decarboxylation of pyruvate (the latter concluded on the basis of the 2,6-DCPIP experiments) are affected by the substitutions. The steady-state kinetic parameters for ThDP and pyruvate with parental E1 and the Y177A and Y177F variants are presented in TableII. The apparent K m for ThDP measured in the overall PDHc reaction in the presence of 0.2–200 μm ThDP was 6.65 μm for the Y177A variant compared with 1.58 μm for parental E1. The Y177F variant was not saturated by ThDP even at a concentration >200 μm, indicating that its activity could be increased with elevated ThDP concentrations (data not shown). A weak positive cooperativity (n H = 1.38) was observed for ThDP binding to parental E1, which, however, changed to a negative cooperativity (n H < 1.0) for the Y177F variant. We previously reported that for single-lipoyl domain PDHc (a single lipoyl domain rather than the three lipoyl domains found in wild-typeE. coli PDHc), variants with the G231A, N258Q, and C259S substitutions in the ThDP-binding fold of the E1 subunit were not saturated by concentrations of ThDP as high as 5–10 mm and exhibited negative cooperativity at all concentrations of ThDP studied (2Yi J.

Similar K m values for pyruvate were obtained for parental E1 (0.515 mm) and the Y177A (0.280 mm) and Y177F (0.531 mm) variants (Table II) at 0.2 mm ThDP, indicating that substitution at Tyr177 in E1 does not affect pyruvate binding.Table IActivities of parental E1 and Y177A and Y177F variants of E1EnzymePyruvate:NAD+ oxidoreductase assay1-aThe activity of parental E1 and its variants was determined using the NADH assay in the presence of 0.2 mm ThDP.k cat2,6-DCPIP assay1-bThis assay was carried out with pyruvate as substrate.2,6-DCPIP assay1-cThis assay was carried out with 2α-hydroxyethyl-ThDP as substrate.units/mg E1s −1units/mg E1milliunits/mg E1Parental E18.71 ± 0.3928.89 ± 1.310.445 ± 0.0289.88 ± 0.65(100%)(100%)(100%)Y177A E10.989 ± 0.0733.31 ± 0.250.087 ± 0.0094.83 ± 1.44 (11%) (20%) (49%)Y177F E10.614 ± 0.0630.216 ± 0.0306.71 ± 1.39 (7%) (49%) (68%)1-a The activity of parental E1 and its variants was determined using the NADH assay in the presence of 0.2 mm ThDP.1-b This assay was carried out with pyruvate as substrate.1-c This assay was carried out with 2α-hydroxyethyl-ThDP as substrate.

Open table in a new tab The following evidence was obtained, suggesting that ThTDP and ThTTDP behave as tight-binding reversible inhibitors of E1. 1) It was shown that 0.8–0.94 mol of ThTDP/mol of E1 monomer and ∼2 mol of ThTTDP/mol of E1 monomer (Fig. 2,A and B) were required to inactivate parental E1. With the Y177A variant, 1.61–1.75 mol of ThTDP/mol of Y177A E1 monomer and 1.34–1.55 mol of ThTTDP/mol of Y177A E1 monomer were required for inactivation. The Y177F variant gave a molar ratio of inactivation by ThTDP similar to that observed with the Y177A variant. 2) According to the Ackermann-Potter plot, using E1 resolved from single-lipoyl domain PDHc, ThTDP was found to behave as a tight-binding inhibitor (Fig. 3). A plot of velocityversus concentration of E1 for different concentrations of ThTDP was curved with an asymptote (Fig. 3). According to the Ackermann-Potter plot (22Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), the asymptote intersects the xaxis at E t = I t . As shown in Fig. 3 (inset), for a ThTDP concentration of 0.03 μm, the total concentration of E1 titrated was 0.035 μm, indicating that the concentration of ThTDP required for inhibition is comparable to the concentration of enzyme, a diagnostic for tight-binding inhibition. When ThTTDP was tested at a concentration of 0.10 μm, the total amount of E1 titrated was ∼0.021 μm, indicating that at least a 5-fold molar excess of ThTTDP is required to inhibit E1 (data not shown). 3) Inhibition of parental E1 by ThTDP and ThTTDP was reversible. About 10% (ThTDP inactivation, followed by 16 h of dialysis) and 34% (ThTTDP inactivation, followed by 48 h of dialysis) of the activity of parental E1 was recovered upon dialysis against 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).Figure 3Plot of steady-state initial velocity as a function of total E1 in the presence of ThTDP (Ackermann-Potter plot). E1 resolved from single-lipoyl domain PDHc (0.0081–0.18 μm) was incubated with ThTDP at the indicated concentrations and 2 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 0.2 ml at 25 °C. After a 30-min incubation, a reaction mixture containing the E2·E3 subcomplex and all components required for assay of PDHc activity was added to a total volume of 1 ml.

A family of progress curves for the reaction, started by the addition of parental E1 and the E2·E3 subcomplex to assay medium containing 30 μm ThDP and different concentrations of ThTDP, is shown in Fig.4 A. In the absence of ThTDP, a linear rate of NADH release was observed during the first 10 min of the reaction (Fig. 4 A). In the presence of ThTDP (Fig.4 A) and ThTTDP (data not shown), a time-dependent decrease in NADH production was observed, indicating a slow attainment of equilibrium between parental E1, ThDP, and ThTDP or parental E1, ThDP, and ThTTDP. Since the concentrations of ThTDP and ThTTDP were at least 10-fold higher than the concentration of parental E1, resulting in the conversion of <5% of pyruvate to product (P) during the reaction, the progress curves were treated according to Equation 4, P=vs×t+vo−vsk×(1−e−kt)Equation 4 where v o is the initial velocity,v s is the steady-state velocity, and k is the pseudo first-order rate constant for the approach to the steady-state phase. The progress curve analysis revealed that the initial velocity of NADH production (v o) decreased with increasing concentration of ThTDP or ThTTDP (data not shown), indicating that the equilibria drawn below are reached rapidly: E1 + ThDP ↔ E1·ThDP and E1 + ThTDP ↔ E1·ThTDP or E1 + ThTTDP ↔ E1·ThTTDP. The dependence of the pseudo first-order rate constant (k app) on the concentration of ThTDP or ThTTDP was hyperbolic, indicating saturation (Fig. 4, B andC). The data suggest that the inhibition of parental E1 by ThTDP and ThTTDP follows mechanism A (Scheme 1) (24Bieth J.G.

The rate constants (k 2 andk −2) and K i values (k −1/k 1) that characterize the equilibrium between parental E1 and the E1·ThTDP and E1·ThTTDP complexes were calculated using Equation 5 and are presented in Table III.kapp=k2×IoIo+Ki×1+SoKm+k−2Equation 5 The progress curves were also recorded for the Y177A variant in the presence of ThTDP.

In this study, we show that activation of the human 5-HT4(h5-HT4) receptor stimulates the secretion of the non-amyloidogenic soluble form of the amyloid precursor protein (sAPPα). 5-HT enhanced the level of secreted sAPPα in a time- and dose-dependent manner in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the h5-HT4(e) receptor isoform. The increase was inhibited by the selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, GR113808. The 5-HT4 selective agonists, prucalopride and renzapride, also increased secreted sAPPα in IMR32 human neuroblastoma cells. The stimulatory effect of 5-HT was mimicked by forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, and 8-bromo-cAMP, a membrane-permeant cAMP analogue. On the contrary, inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) by H89 potentiated the 5-HT-induced increase in both secreted and cellular sAPPα. This phenomenon involves a novel PKA-independent stimulatory process that overcomes a PKA-dependent inhibitory one. Finally, activation of the h5-HT4(e) receptor did not modify extracellular amyloid β-protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human APP695. Given the neuroprotective and enhancing memory effects of sAPPα, our results may open a new avenue for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 321-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Senile plaques are mainly composed of a small insoluble peptide of 40–42 amino acids called amyloid β-protein (Aβ), and most evidence gathered over the past decade indicates that accumulation of Aβ is a key event in the pathogenesis of AD (for review see Ref.2Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). Aβ derives from a larger transmembrane glycoprotein, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), with several isoforms resulting from the alternative splicing of a single primary transcript and is expressed in all mammalian cells. Mutations in the APP gene result in the abnormal processing of APP that may lead to Aβ deposits and accumulation in the brain of AD patients (Ref. 3Cai X.D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1993; 259: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar and for review see Ref. 4Hardy J. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 154-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). APP can be processed via various complex pathways to produce amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic peptides. In the α-secretase pathway, APP holoprotein is cleaved within the amyloidogenic Aβ domain producing a large N-terminal non-amyloidogenic soluble APP (sAPPα), which is secreted in the extracellular medium (5Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Secreted sAPPα has potent neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities by preventing oxidative damage induced by Aβ (6Mattson M.P. Cheng B. Culwell A.R. Esch F.S. Lieberburg I. Rydel R.E. Neuron. 1993; 10: 243-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 7Schubert D. Behl C. Brain Res. 1993; 629: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8Behl C. Davis J.B. Lesley R. Schubert D. Cell. 1994; 77: 817-827Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2049) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the so-called β-,γ-secretase pathway of APP leads to the formation of intact Aβ peptides that can form neurotoxic Aβ aggregates (9Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Because of their role in the production of Aβ, the molecular identification of APP secretases and the regulation of their cellular activity are under intense investigations. Recently, an aspartic protease, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (named BACE), has been cloned and characterized for its β-secretase activity (for review see Ref.10Nunan J. Small D.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Also, a number of β- and γ-secretase inhibitors have been synthesized and successfully used to lower Aβ secretion (11Li Y.M. Xu M. Lai M.T. Huang Q. Castro J.L. DiMuzio-Mower J. Harrison T. Lellis C. Nadin A. Neduvelil J.G. Register R.B. Sardana M.K. Shearman M.S. Smith A.L. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J.

However, the β- and γ-secretases may be implicated in the processing of other proteins having specific functions, and consequently the use of inhibitors may have unwanted side effects (14De Strooper B. Nature. 2000; 405: 627-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) may regulate APP metabolism though a complex network of intracellular second messengers (Ref. 15Nitsch R.M. Slack B.E. Wurtman R.J. Growdon J.H. Science. 1992; 258: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar and for review see Ref. 16Racchi M. Govoni S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 418-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These include phospholipase C-coupled receptors such as muscarinic acetylcholine m1 and m3 receptor subtypes and metabotropic glutamate receptors (16Racchi M. Govoni S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 418-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Lee R.K. Wurtman R.J. Cox A.J. Nitsch R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More recently, the neuroprotective activity of the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor type I, which is positively coupled to adenylate cyclase, has been shown to be accompanied by an increased release of sAPPα (19Lezoualc'h F. Engert S. Berning B. Behl C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Many populations of neurons are affected in AD, especially the cholinergic and serotoninergic neurons of hippocampal and cortical regions. Because neuronal activity may be involved in the regulation of APP metabolism, impaired neuronal signaling may lead to abnormal processing of APP and subsequent Aβ deposition. Consequently, it is important to understand the regulatory mechanism of APP metabolism by neurotransmitter receptors. The serotonin 5-HT4 receptor has recently gained a lot of attention for its physiological effects in the brain (20Eglen R.M. Wong E.H. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 391-398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Indeed, with the recent availability of selective 5-HT4 ligands, pharmacological studies have shown that activation of the 5-HT4 receptor increases memory and learning in rats (21Marchetti E. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Soumireu-Mourat B. Roman F.S. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Accordingly, 5-HT4 receptor-binding sites have been detected in the hippocampal formation and in neocortical areas (22Bonaventure P. Hall H. Gommeren W. Cras P. Langlois X. Jurzak M. Leysen J.E. Synapse. 2000; 36: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and activation of the 5-HT4 receptor stimulates acetylcholine release in rat frontal cortex (23Consolo S. Arnaboldi S. Giorgi S. Russi G. Ladinsky H. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 1230-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is a marked loss of 5-HT4 receptor-binding sites in cortical and hippocampal regions in the brain of AD patients (24Reynolds G.P. Mason S.L. Meldrum A. De Keczer S. Parnes H. Eglen R.M. Wong E.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Altogether these observations suggest that the 5-HT4 receptor may be a potential pharmacological target for the treatment of AD. Several splice variants of the human 5-HT4 receptor (h5-HT4) have recently been described, particularly at the C terminus where alternative splicing results in divergent sequences following Leu358 (25Blondel O. Gastineau M. Dahmoune Y. Langlois M. Fischmeister R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2252-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26Claeysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol.

Fischmeister R. Lezoualc'h F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These h5-HT4receptor isoforms belong to the family of seven transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptors that activate adenylyl cyclase (25Blondel O. Gastineau M. Dahmoune Y. Langlois M. Fischmeister R. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2252-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 26Claeysen S. Sebben M. Becamel C. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Mol.

Fischmeister R. Lezoualc'h F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Most of the h5-HT4 receptor splice variants are expressed in the brain. Despite a report of beneficial effects of 5-HT4 ligands on memory in rats (21Marchetti E. Dumuis A. Bockaert J. Soumireu-Mourat B. Roman F.S. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), there is no information about the biological significance of the recently cloned h5-HT4 receptor isoforms in the brain. In this study, we show for the first time that activation of the human 5-HT4(h5-HT4) receptor increases the secretion of the non-amyloidogenic sAPPα. This process is demonstrated in CHO cells stably expressing the h5-HT4(e) receptor, a neuronal h5-HT4 receptor isoform, and in IMR32 neuroblastoma cells using 5-HT4 selective ligands. In addition, we analyzed the signaling pathways involved in sAPPα release after activation of the h5-HT4(e) receptor isoform. All media, sera, and antibiotics used in the cell culture were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The 5-HT4 receptor antagonist GR113808 ([1-[2-(methylsulfonyl)amino]ethyl]-4-piperidinyl]methyl-1-methyl-1H-indole-3-carboxylate) and the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist GR127935 (N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl]-2′-methyl-4′-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)[1,1-biphenyl]-4-carboxamide) were gifts from Glaxo Wellcome. Renzapride ((Life Technologies, Inc., 24924), (±)-endo-4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxy-N-(1-azabicyclo[3.3.1]non-4-yl)benzamide monohydrochloride),and prucalopride (4-amino-5-chloro-2,3-dihydro-N-[1-(3-methoxypropyl)-4-piperidinyl]-7-benzofurancarboxamide monohydrochloride) were generously given by Smith Kline & French Laboratories and Janssen Research Foundation (Beerse, Belgium), respectively. 5-HT was from Aldrich. Forskolin was from Sigma, and 8-bromo-cAMP and the protein kinase A inhibitor, H89, were obtained from Calbiochem. The human neuronal neuroblastoma cell line IMR32 was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and was grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% non-essential amino acids, and antibiotics. Chinese Hamster ovary cells (CHO) cells stably expressing the h5-HT4(e) receptor isoform were cultured as described previously (28Mialet J. Berque-Bestel I. Eftekhari P. Gastineau M. Giner M. Dahmoune Y. Donzeau-Gouge P. Hoebeke J. Langlois M. Sicsic S. Fischmeister R. Lezoualc'h F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For transient transfection experiments, CHO cells stably expressing the h5-HT4(e) receptor isoform were transfected with the cDNA encoding the human APP695 using jetPEITM (Polyplus transfection, Illkirch, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 50–60% confluent cell cultures were incubated for 5 h in a mixture of a cationic transfection reagent vector and APP695 cDNA. At the end of the incubation period, media were changed, and cells were cultured for an additional period of 60 h before the determination of sAPPα and Aβ. PCRs for the detection of the expression of h5-HT4 receptor mRNAs in IMR32 cells were performed as described previously (28Mialet J. Berque-Bestel I. Eftekhari P. Gastineau M. Giner M. Dahmoune Y. Donzeau-Gouge P. Hoebeke J. Langlois M. Sicsic S. Fischmeister R. Lezoualc'h F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from IMR32 cells using the Trizol RNA purification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was then reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) primers and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies Inc.). cDNA specific for the common part of the h5-HT4 receptor isoforms was detected using a nested PCR amplification. A first reaction was performed using 50 ng of cDNA together with specific primers, C1F (5′-TAATGCTGGGAGGCTGCTGG-3′) and C1R (5′-AGAGGATGATGAGGAAGGCA-3′) designed to the 5′- and 3′-end of the h5-HT4 receptor, respectively. Products of this first reaction were used as templates for a nested PCR amplification with specific C2F forward primer (5′-ATGGTCAACAAGCCCTACGC-3′) and C2R reverse primer (5′-GCAGAGGCAGAAGCAACCCA-3′) that recognize the common part of h5-HT4 receptors. PCRs were performed as follows: 30 cycles (30 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 1.5 min at 72 °C) and a final elongation (8 min at 72 °C). The PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized under UV. R1736 (antibody kindly provided by Dr. Dennis Selkoe, Harvard Medical School, Boston) is a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised to a synthetic peptide of amino acids 595–611 of APP (29Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). This corresponds to positions −2 to +15 of human Aβ, and it presents 90% (15 out of 17 amino acids) of sequence homology with the hamster sequence which is identical to other rodents such as mouse (GenBankTM accession number AF030413). R1736 is not only selective for the human APPα but also for the rodent form. Indeed, it has been successfully used to show the endogenous α-secreted cleavage of APP molecules with a molecular mass of around 110 kDa in several rodent cellular systems (19Lezoualc'h F. Engert S. Berning B. Behl C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 147-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,29Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I.

Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Monoclonal antibodies 4G8 and 6E10 (Signet Laboratories, Dedham, MA) are reactive to amino acid residues 17–24 and 1–17 of Aβ, respectively (52Kim K.S. Wen G.Y. Bancher C.M. Chen J. Sapeenza V.J. Hong H. Wisniewski H.M. Neurosci. Res. Commun. 1990; 7: 118-122Google Scholar). For determination of secreted and intracellular sAPP, confluent CHO and IMR32 cell cultures were cultured in 5% dialyzed FCS-containing medium overnight and in serum-free medium for 4 h, respectively. At the beginning of the assay, CHO cells were washed with PBS and preincubated for 15 min in serum-free medium supplemented with 1 μmGR127935 to block the activity of endogenous 5-HT1Breceptors. Then 5-HT4 ligands and drugs were added for the indicated times. Conditioned supernatants containing secreted proteins were collected, and cells were lysed for subsequent analyses. Collected media were centrifuged to remove cell debris, size-selected using Sephadex G-25M columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and reconstituted in 70 μl of buffer consisting of 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The protein amount in each sample was determined with the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). 50 μg of cell lysates or 100 μg of secreted proteins were run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were blocked by incubation overnight at 4 °C with 5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) containing 0.5% Tween 20 and then were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween and incubated with the monoclonal antibody 22C11 (5Weidemann A.

Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) (1:80 dilution), the polyclonal antiserum R1736 (1:3000 dilution), or the monoclonal antibody 6E10 (1:1000 dilution). After incubation at room temperature for 2 h, blots were rinsed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween and were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 1:7500 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were then visualized by the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on Kodak ML lights films. For quantification, films of representative experiments were scanned using a Bio-Rad image acquisition system (Ivry-Sur-Seine, France, gel doc 1000) and fold induction of sAPPα expression level compared with corresponding controls was calculated. Western blot experiments were repeated at least 3 times with identical results. Secretion media and cell lysates were collected and diluted in a 0.1 volume of TNE buffer 10× (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5). Total Aβ was immunoprecipitated overnight with a 200-fold dilution of 4G8 clone in the presence of protein G-Sepharose. Following immunoprecipitation, samples were electrophoresed on 16.5% Tris/Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto a 0.2 μm nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) at 380 mA for 45 min. Filters were boiled in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and analyzed by Western blot as described above using a 1:1000 dilution of the monoclonal antibody 6E10. For measurement of intracellular cAMP production, IMR32 neuroblastoma cells grown to confluence in 60-mm plates were incubated overnight in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. At the beginning of the assay, IMR32 cells were preincubated for 15 min in serum-free medium supplemented with 5 mm theophylline and 10 μm pargyline. The 5-HT4 antagonist, GR113808, was also included during this preincubation period. 5-HT or other serotoninergic agonists were then added for an additional 10-min period. The reaction was stopped by aspiration of the medium and addition of 500 μl of ice-cold perchloric acid (20%). After a 30-min period, neutralization buffer was added (25 mm HEPES, 2n KOH). cAMP was quantified using a radioimmunoassay kit (cAMP competitive radioimmunoassay, Immunotech, Marseille, France). This assay was performed as described previously (30Busca R. Abbe P. Mantoux F. Aberdam E. Peyssonnaux C. Eychene A. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R.

Briefly, CHO cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and then stimulated as described and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaPPi, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaF, 100 IU/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100. The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and were incubated with the following buffer containing 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 68.5 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.15 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mg/ml glucose, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1.85 mmCaCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 100 μmKemptide (Calbiochem) and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was performed at 37 °C for 10 min and then stopped by spotting onto Whatman P81 papers. The papers were washed three times with 1% (v/v) orthophosphoric acid, rinsed twice in ethanol, and air-dried. The radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. An unpaired Student's ttest was used to calculate differences between means; differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. The effect of the activation of the h5-HT4 receptor on sAPPα release was analyzed in CHO cells stably expressing the neuronal h5-HT4(e) receptor isoform (28Mialet J. Berque-Bestel I. Eftekhari P. Gastineau M. Giner M. Dahmoune Y. Donzeau-Gouge P. Hoebeke J. Langlois M. Sicsic S. Fischmeister R. Lezoualc'h F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This CHO cell line stably transfected with the recombinant h5-HT4(e) receptor displayed a typical 5-HT4 pharmacological profile as determined previously in binding studies and adenylyl cyclase assays (28Mialet J.

Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, the receptor is expressed at physiological density because the number of specific 5-HT4-binding sites is in accordance with that found in human brain (28Mialet J. Berque-Bestel I. Eftekhari P. Gastineau M. Giner M. Dahmoune Y. Donzeau-Gouge P. Hoebeke J. Langlois M. Sicsic S. Fischmeister R. Lezoualc'h F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). By using an N-terminal monoclonal antibody against APP (22C11) (5Weidemann A. Konig G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M.

Science. 1992; 258: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar), we showed by Western blot that secreted sAPPα is increased in CHO cell clones following a 30-min incubation with 1 μm 5-HT compared with untreated control cells (Fig.1). Because the 22C11 monoclonal antibody can also recognize APP-like proteins such as APP-like protein 2 (31Slunt H.H. Thinakaran G. Von Koch C. Lo A.C. Tanzi R.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2637-2644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we performed immunoblots with the R1736 antiserum which is specific for sAPPα (29Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y.

Similarly, a single band migrating at the expected molecular mass of 110 kDa was also detected with R1736 (Fig. 1). These data suggest that secreted sAPP is produced by non-amyloidogenic α-cleavage. 5-HT-induced secretion of sAPPα in CHO cells expressing the h5-HT4(e) receptor was dose-dependent (Fig.2 A). Fig. 2 A shows a representative gel depicting an increase in sAPPα secretion with increasing concentrations of 5-HT after 30 min of application. The levels of secreted sAPPα after treatment with micromolar concentrations of 5-HT was significantly different in CHO cells transfected with the h5-HT4(e) receptor from that of non-transfected cells (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). The 5-HT-induced increase in sAPPα release reached a plateau, and the maximal release of sAPPα obtained at 1 μm 5-HT was about 2.5-fold (range 2.1–3.7) above its basal level (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). No effect of 5-HT on sAPPα release could be detected in the non-transfected CHO control cells (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). In addition, the level of intracellular sAPPα was also enhanced after 30 min of treatment with increasing concentrations of 5-HT (Fig. 2 B). Time course analyses showed that 5-HT-induced release of sAPPα was rapid, and the amount of secreted sAPPα reached a plateau with a maximum after 15 min of incubation with 1 μm 5-HT in CHO cells expressing the h5-HT4(e) receptor (Fig.3).Figure 3The h5-HT4(e) receptor time-dependently enhances the release of secreted sAPPα.

As shown in Fig.4, increasing concentrations of GR113808 antagonized 5-HT-enhanced sAPPα release in CHO cells expressing the h5-HT4(e) receptor. This result indicates that the effects of 5-HT on secreted sAPPα is specifically mediated by the h5-HT4(e) receptor (Fig. 4). In addition, a constitutive activity of the h5-HT4(e) receptor on basal sAPPα release was observed in the absence of any 5-HT4 ligand (Fig.5 A). Indeed, the relative basal level of secreted sAPPα in CHO cells stably expressing the h5-HT4(e) receptor was around 2-fold higher than in untransfected CHO cells (Fig. 5 A). This effect was not due to the presence of 5-HT in culture medium because cells were cultured overnight before the assay in dialyzed FCS-containing medium. These data clearly indicate that expression of the h5-HT4(e)receptor induced a spontaneously active receptor state that may influence sAPPα release.Figure 5Effects of a selective 5-HT4antagonist, GR113808 , on basal and stimulated levels of secreted sAPPα in CHO cells stably transfected with the h5-HT4(e) receptor.

To elucidate structural properties of the expanded polyglutamine, we prepared sperm whale myoglobin (Mb) mutants, in which 12, 28, 35, and 50 repeats of glutamine were inserted at the corner between the C and D helices (Gln12, Gln28, Gln35, and Gln50, respectively). Circular dichroism and IR spectroscopies showed that the expanded polyglutamine, which was recognized by the monoclonal antibody 1C2 in Gln28, Gln35, and Gln50 Mb forms an antiparallel β-pleated sheet structure. Gln50 Mb aggregates were found to comprise an intermolecular antiparallel β-pleated sheet. Fluorescence together with 1H NMR spectra revealed partial unfolding of the protein surface in Gln35 and Gln50 Mb, although the structural changes in the protein core were rather small. The present results indicate that the fluctuating β-pleated sheet of the expanded polyglutamine exposed on the protein surface facilitates the formation of aggregates through intermolecular interactions. The present study has first established and characterized structural properties of a molecular model for polyglutamine diseases in which various lengths of polyglutamine including a pathologically expanded glutamine repeat were inserted into a structurally known protein.

Huntington's disease spinocerebellar ataxia myoglobin sperm whale circular dichroism infrared glutathioneS-transferase chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 Machado-Joseph disease Fourier-transferred infrared 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid guanidinium hydrochloride Neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD)1 and hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) are linked to abnormally expanded CAG repeats in the coding regions of responsible genes and are categorized as CAG repeat diseases. The expanded CAG repeat is translated into an extended polyglutamine, which confers deleterious novel functions on the mutant proteins. A hallmark of CAG repeat diseases is the development of intracellular protein aggregates in vulnerable neurons. The aggregate formation is closely related to expansion of the CAG repeat, namely expanded polyglutamine in the affected proteins. Trottier et al. (1Trottier Y. Lutz Y. Stevanin G. Imbert G. Devys D. Cancel G. Saudou F. Weber C. David G. Tora L. Agid Y. Brice A. Mandel J.-L. Nature. 1995; 378: 403-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) reported that the expanded polyglutamine in the proteins implicated with HD, SCA1, and SCA3 are selectively recognized by the monoclonal antibody 1C2. The finding that 1C2 reacts with polyglutamine only of the pathological repeat length provided a structural basis for the notion that the expanded polyglutamine forms an abnormal structure, resulting in the formation of aggregates and possibly inducing neuronal cell death. Although the importance of understanding the structure of the expanded polyglutamine has been emphasized, the highly unstable proteins tethering an expanded glutamine repeat have prevented isolation of the affected proteins. For instance, proteolytic cleavage of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) from GST-huntingtin(exon1) fusion protein rapidly leads to the formation of insoluble aggregate (2Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). To elucidate the structure of the expanded glutamine repeat, polyglutamine peptides were synthesized. Poly-l-glutamine, however, is insoluble in water, and even short oligoglutamine chains form aggregates in solution to form viscous gels (3Perutz M.F. Johnson T. Suzuki M. Finch J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5355-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Perutz et al. (3Perutz M.F. Johnson T. Suzuki M. Finch J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5355-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar) found, using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, that 15 glutamine repeats form a β-sheet structure and proposed from results of computer simulation that two paired antiparallel β-strands of poly-l-glutamine form a “polar zipper” structure. On the other hand, Altschuler et al. (4Altschuler E.L. Hud N.V. Mazrimas J.A. Rupp B. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 50: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) showed that 17 glutamine repeats do not adopt a β-sheet but form a random coil structure. The discrepancy in these results may have been caused by differing composition of the polar residues such as Asp and Lys added to both ends of the polyglutamine peptide. Although the polar residues are essential to increase the solubility of the polyglutamine peptide, the introduction of polar residues may induce some artificial effects on the structure of polyglutamine. Another strategy to explore the structure of polyglutamine is to insert a polyglutamine molecule into a specific region of a stable protein. Mutant mice carrying an expanded CAG repeat introduced into the mouse hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) gene developed a phenotype similar to that of human CAG repeat diseases, suggesting that expanded CAG repeats do not necessarily have to be located within the genes that already have a CAG repeat (5Ordway J.M. Tallaksen-Greene S. Gutekunst C. Bernstein E.M. Cearley J.A. Wiener H.W. Dure IV, L.S. Lindsey R. Hersch S.M. Jope R.S. Albin R.L. Detloff P.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 753-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In other words, any protein having an expanded glutamine repeat can be a model for the gene products of CAG repeat diseases. Stott et al.(6Stott K. Blackburn J.M. Butler P.J.G. Perutz M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6509-6513Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) characterized a chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2) mutant containing an inserted 10 glutamine repeat. CD spectroscopy showed that the CI2 mutant forms a type I β-turn in a monomer state and a β-sheet in dimeric and trimeric states. The x-ray crystal structure of the polyglutamine moiety in the mutant has not been solved due to disorder of the polyglutamine tract (7Chen Y.W. Stott K. Perutz M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1257-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The glutamine repeats examined in these studies using polyglutamine peptides and the CI2 mutant are much shorter than the pathological repeat in CAG repeat diseases (∼35 glutamine repeats). Furthermore, the reactivities of both polyglutamine peptides and the CI2 mutant with the 1C2 antibody have not been reported, although it is crucial to examine the polyglutamine structure that is recognized by 1C2. Therefore, a putative aberrant structure of the expanded polyglutamine has remained unclear. In addition, the effects of the expanded glutamine repeat on protein structure and stability have never been investigated. These influences might also be crucial for the aggregate formation since the expansion of polyglutamine may induce serious structural changes in the other parts of the protein, which would facilitate the formation of aggregates. In the present study, we inserted an expanded glutamine repeat into sperm whale myoglobin (SW Mb) since SW Mb is one of the most stable proteins, and it is highly soluble. 12, 28, 35, or 50 repeats of glutamine were inserted at the corner between the C and D helices in Mb (Gln12, Gln28, Gln35, and Gln50, respectively). The number of glutamine repeats in HD patients is more than 36. Thus, 12 and 28 glutamine repeats are nonpathological and the 50 glutamine repeat is pathological, whereas the 35 glutamine repeat is located near the border between normal individuals and HD patients. We expressed these mutant Mbs inEscherichia coli and examined the structures of the mutants as well as the effects of expanded glutamine repeat on protein stability using various types of spectroscopy including CD, infrared (IR), and 1H NMR. PstI and SpeI sites were introduced at the positions of Ser-44 and Arg-47, respectively, in the pUC19-SW Mb expression vector constructed by Springer and Sligar (8Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8961-8965Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We obtained various lengths of CAG repeats (12, 28, 35, or 50) from the Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) gene. To assist protein folding, several codons from the MJD gene were added to both ends of the CAG repeat. The DNA fragments including CAG repeats flanked by PstI and SpeI sites were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and ligated into the pUC19-SW Mb expression vector. TB1 was used as a host E. coli strain for expression of the pUC19-SW Mb vector. Recombinant SW Mb was expressed and purified according to the method of Springer and Sligar (8Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8961-8965Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Purity of the final sample checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a single protein band. The RZ (ratio of the absorbance at 408 nm to that at 280 nm) values of purified ferric wild-type is 5.0, whereas those of the mutant Mbs (Gln12, Gln28, and Gln35) were above 4.0. The RZ value of the Gln50 Mb mutant was more than 3.3. The extinction coefficient, 157 mm−1·cm−1, at the Soret band in a UV-visible spectrum determined the concentration of ferric Mbs. A polyclonal antibody for human myoglobin (Chemicon) and a monoclonal antibody for polyglutamine (1C2) (Chemicon) were used for immunoblotting. Far-UV CD spectra of ferric Mbs (3.1 μm) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 were measured using a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C. The spectra were an average of 16 scans recorded at a speed of 100 nm/min and a resolution of 0.2 nm. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a BRUKER Avance DRX600 spectrometer at 25.0 °C. A LOSAT pulse sequence was used with 64,000 data transformations of 180 kHz and a 14-μs 90° pulse. The concentrations of ferric and cyanide-ligated Mbs were about 400 and 200 μm, respectively, on the heme basis in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 containing 90% H2O, 10%2H2O. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained using a Fluorolog spectrofluorometer (HORIBA). Fluorescence from Mbs (3.2 μm) was measured at room temperature in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Samples were excited at 280 nm, and fluorescence emission was scanned from 300 to 450 nm at a speed of 60 nm/min. Fourier-transferred infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on an FT-IR 8300 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) using an infrared cuvette with two 13- × 22-mm CaF2 windows separated by a 0.1-mm spacer. Solutions of ∼500 μmferric Mbs were prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pD 7.0. The FT-IR spectra were an average of 4096 scans recorded at a speed of 15 scans/min and a resolution of 2 cm−1. 5 μl of 200 μm Mb, which was incubated at 37 °C for 5 days, was mixed with 100 μl of 2.5 μm Congo red solution and left at ambient temperature for 30 min. The UV-visible spectrum of the mixture was measured on a Shimadzu UV-2400 spectrophotometer. 150 μm Mb was incubated at 37 °C for 2 weeks and adsorbed onto carbon-coated 400-mesh copper grids followed by 2% paraformaldehyde, 2% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer. The sample was negatively stained with 2% sodium phosphotungstic acid. Images were recorded on a LEO 912AB electron microscope (LEO, Cambridge, UK) at a magnification of × 50,000. For cyano-Mb unfolding, 2 μm holo-Mb was dissolved in 10 mm MOPS buffer containing 2 μm hemin and 80 μm KCN at 25 °C with various amounts of guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) (9Luo Y. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The unfolding reaction mixture was incubated at 25 °C for more than 1 h to reach equilibrium before acquiring CD or UV-visible spectra. For refolding, 80 μm holo-Mb was first unfolded in the MOPS buffer (pH 7.0) containing 6 m GdmCl, 80 μm hemin, and 3.2 mm KCN and then diluted to 2 μm with 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) at various final GdmCl concentrations. CD and UV-visible spectra of wild-type and mutant Mbs in the absence or presence of various concentrations of GdmCl were measured, and molar ellipticities at 222 nm and absorbances at 419 nm were respectively recorded. Sperm whale Mb is a single polypeptide chain of 153 residues consisting of eight α-helices from A to H that occupy 80% of the total residues and that does not contain any β-sheet structures (Fig.1 A). The eight α-helices are packed tightly, and a heme prosthetic group located between the E and F helices reinforces their packing, which renders the protein quite stable. The x-ray crystal structure of SW Mb shows that the loop between the C and D helices (C-D corner) is exposed to solvent and that the temperature factors of the residues in the loop region are higher than any other residues, suggesting that the C-D corner is quite flexible and does not contribute to the stability of the protein (10Phillips Jr., G.N. Arduini R.M. Springer B.A. Sligar S.G. Proteins. 1990; 7: 358-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, a polyglutamine chain inserted at the corner between the C and D helices in Mb should form its own inherent structure. In this study, we prepared SW Mb mutants, in which 12, 28, 35, or 50 repeats of glutamine were inserted at the corner between the C and D helices (Gln12, Gln28, Gln35, and Gln50, respectively). To assist formation of the intrinsic structure of the insert, we added several residues from the MJD protein as a linker to both ends of the polyglutamine stretch (Fig.1 A). To confirm correct folding of the mutant Mbs, UV-visible spectra of ferric mutant Mbs were measured. The spectral features of all mutant Mbs were quite similar to that of wild-type Mb (data not shown). This result indicates that the mutant Mbs were properly folded regardless of the inserted glutamine repeat. We examined whether or not the polyglutamine inserted into SW Mb also forms the abnormal structure as do the proteins for CAG repeat diseases by immunoblotting with 1C2 antibody. While the amounts of wild-type and mutant Mbs were almost identical as indicated by the immunoblot with the Mb antibody, the reactivity of mutant Mbs using 1C2 clearly depended on the length of the glutamine repeat (Fig. 1,B and C). A specific band was detected in the lanes containing Gln28, Gln35, and Gln50 Mbs, of which Gln50 reacted most intensely against 1C2 antibody. In contrast, neither Gln12nor the wild-type Mb developed bands. We concluded that the mutant Mbs formed a polyglutamine structure similar to that of the proteins for CAG repeat diseases, indicating that the mutant Mb is a good model protein for CAG repeat diseases. To examine the formation of aggregates, 100 μmGln50 was incubated at 37 °C for 1, 2, and 3 days, and the same aliquot of the “aged” Gln50 solution was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting using Mb and 1C2 antibodies (Fig. 1, D andE). Mb antibody stained a gel top as well as a soluble monomeric Gln50 at 26 kDa, whereas 1C2 antibody did not react with the aggregates at the gel top but did react with the soluble form. The staining of the gel top by Mb antibody clearly indicates the formation of aggregates in the Gln50 mutant. Thus, Gln50 Mb readily formed aggregates upon incubation at 37 °C, while the Gln35 and Gln28 mutants require longer incubation time to form aggregates, and the Gln12 mutant did not form aggregates (data not shown). The decrease in the amount of 2- and 3-day aged Gln50 mutant in Fig. 1 D suggested that some of the Gln50aggregates did not enter the gel. The immunoreactivity of the gel-excluded aggregates to the Mb antibody would also be diminished possibly due to the decrease in accessibility of the Mb antibody to the more rigid forms of Gln50 aggregates after the long aging. Since the molecular mass of the Gln50 mutant is 26 kDa, Gln50 oligomers (less than 10-mer) could be detected in the denaturing gel. However, there was no band corresponding to the oligomeric Gln50 mutants in the gel during the formation of aggregates (Fig. 1, D and E). We further investigated whether Gln50 oligomers were transiently present in the process of aggregate formation using analytical ultracentrifugation. 100 μm Gln50 was centrifuged at 60,000 rpm at 20 °C, and the absorbances at 280 and 400 nm were monitored. In this experiment, only monomeric and aggregated forms of Gln50 were detected, whereas any stable oligomers were not observed during the formation of aggregates (data not shown). Next, structural features of the inserted polyglutamine in the mutant Mbs were investigated. We initially examined the secondary structure of the inserted polyglutamine using CD spectroscopy. Fig.2 A shows the CD spectra of ferric wild-type and mutant Mbs in the far-UV region. The spectrum of wild-type Mb, which contains only α-helices, was typical of an α-helix with two negative peaks at 209 and 222 nm (11Townend R. Kumosinski T.F. Timasheff S.N. Fasman G.D. Davidson B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 23: 163Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although the spectral shapes of the mutant Mbs were similar to that of wild-type Mb, a negative molar ellipticity at 208 nm was slightly enhanced upon elongation of the glutamine repeat. Subtraction of the wild-type spectrum from the spectra of the mutants revealed the CD spectra of the polyglutamine inserts in the mutant Mbs (Fig. 2 B). The molar ellipticity at 206 and 222 nm in the difference CD spectra decreased as the glutamine repeats were extended. We then examined the secondary structure of the glutamine repeat inserted into SW Mb by FT-IR spectroscopy. Fig.3 A shows FT-IR spectra in the amide I region of wild-type and mutant Mbs. We observed a large peak centered at 1650 cm−1 in the spectrum of wild-type Mb that has been previously assigned to the amide I band of α-helix in carbon monoxide-ligated myoglobin (12Dong A. Huang O. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Although the IR spectra of mutant Mbs resembled that of the wild-type, slight but significant differences were detected. These were clarified by the difference spectra as shown in Fig. 3 B. A positive peak was observed at 1634 cm−1 in the difference spectra of mutant Mbs, and its intensity increased upon expansion of the glutamine repeat. An IR spectrum of a typical β-sheet-rich protein, β-lactoglobulin, showed a peak at 1635 cm−1 and has been previously assigned to the amide I band of an intramolecular β-sheet (13Dong A. Matsuura J. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, the present data demonstrated that the polyglutamine inserted in Mb forms an intramolecular β-pleated sheet. In addition, we found that the peaks at 1616, 1674, and 1685 cm−1 appeared only in the difference spectrum of Gln50 Mb. A previous study assigned the pair of the peaks at 1616 and 1685 cm−1 to an intermolecular antiparallel β-pleated sheet aggregate (13Dong A. Matsuura J. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. Arch. Biochem.

After measuring the mutant Mbs, only Gln50 Mb formed a viscous gel, indicating that the aggregates formed by the Gln50mutant comprise the intermolecular antiparallel β-pleated sheet structure. The spectrum of “aged Gln35”, which was incubated at 37 °C, also showed the pair of the peaks, indicating slower formation of the intermolecular β-sheet aggregates in the Gln35 mutant. The binding of Mb aggregates to Congo red was examined to detect amyloid fibrils. After 200 μm Mbs were incubated at 37 °C for 5 days, UV-visible spectra were measured for the mixtures of the Mbs and Congo red. The spectrum of the Congo red with wild-type Mb exhibited an absorption maximum (λmax) at 491 nm, which was identical to that of an intact Congo red. λmaxof the Congo red with Gln12, Gln28, Gln35, and Gln50 Mbs clearly showed a redshift from 491 to 497, 503, 508, and 520 nm, respectively. In particular, the redshift of λmax was prominent in the Gln50mutant. λmax of Congo red did not change upon addition of β-lactoglobulin solution (data not shown). Birefringence was also observed under a polarizing microscope for the Gln50aggregates stained by Congo red (data not shown). These findings clearly indicated that the Gln50 aggregates comprise amyloid fibrils. Electron microscopy also revealed the bundles of fibers with various diameters (10–20 nm) and lengths (200–1000 nm) in the Gln50 aggregates as shown in Fig.4. We examined the effects of expanding the glutamine repeat on other regions of the protein. Since the heme group in SW Mb has paramagnetism and is located in the interior of the protein, we investigated the structural effects of polyglutamine on the protein core, the heme, and the heme environmental structure using paramagnetic 1H NMR spectroscopy. The resonances position for heme peripheral methyl groups at 90, 84, 72, and 53 ppm (8-, 5-, 3-, and 1-methyl group) as well as for NδH of the proximal His (His-93) at 103 ppm were not changed by the insertion and expansion of the glutamine repeat (14La Mar G.N. Budd D.L. Smith K.M. Langry K.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 108: 1822-1827Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 A). To further understand the heme environmental structure, we measured the 1H NMR spectra of cyanide-ligated Mbs. Several amino acid protons surrounding the heme group and heme peripheral protons have been assigned in the low field region. While 5-, 1-, and 8-methyl protons of the heme group were observed at 27.3, 18.7, and 12.9 ppm, His-93 NδH, Phe-43 CζH, and His-93 NpH were detected at 21.3, 17.2, and 13.8 ppm, respectively, in the spectrum of wild-type Mb (15La Mar G.N. Emerson S.D. Lecomte J.T.J. Pande U. Smith K.M. Craig G. Kehres L.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5568-5573Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig.5 B). The spectral profile was not affected by introducing a glutamine repeat into the C-D corner of Mb. In the high field region, a broad signal at −9.9 ppm that is assigned to Ile-99 CγH was not changed in the mutant Mbs (15La Mar G.N. Emerson S.D. Lecomte J.T.J. Pande U. Smith K.M. Craig G. Kehres L.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 5568-5573Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The lesser spectral changes in the heme and heme environment by glutamine repeats were also confirmed by the resonance Raman spectra of ferric and ferrous Mbs (data not shown). To examine the effects of the inserted glutamine repeat on the protein surface, we measured fluorescence by tyrosine and tryptophan residues with excitation at 280 nm. Three tyrosines (Tyr-103, Tyr-146, and Tyr-151) and one tryptophan (Trp-7) are located at the protein surface, while one tryptophan (Trp-14) is buried inside the protein. Since the fluorescence from Trp-14 is readily quenched by the heme group, the emission from the three Tyr residues and one Trp-7 contribute to the fluorescence spectra (16Hirsch R.E. Zukin R.S. Nagel R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 93: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The emission maximum in fluorescence spectra is roughly correlated with the distance and orientation between heme and Tyr/Trp in heme proteins (17Postonikova G.B. Komarov Y.E. Yumakova E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since the geometry of the heme group was not altered by the inserted glutamine repeat (Fig. 5), the emission maximum in this study provides structural information on the three Tyr and one Trp residues located on the protein surface. The emission maximum was 331 nm in the fluorescence spectrum of wild-type Mb, while the wavelength at the peak showed a redshift from 331 to 334, 342, 344, and 347 nm in the spectra of Gln12, Gln28, Gln35, and Gln50 mutant Mbs, respectively. The redshift of the emission maximum is caused by exposing Tyr and/or Trp to the solvent (17Postonikova G.B. Komarov Y.E. Yumakova E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To gain more insights, we measured a fluorescence spectrum of wild-type Mb in 5 mm citrate at pH 4.2 where the surface of apomyoglobin is unfolded, but the interior of the protein is folded as in the native state (18Jennings P.A. Wright P.E. Science. 1993; 262: 92-96Crossref Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 19Eliezer D. Yao J. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The spectrum of wild type at pH 4.2 showed an emission maximum at 346 nm, which was very close to those of Gln35 and Gln50 mutant Mbs. The previous result suggests that expanding the glutamine repeat induced a fluctuation of the protein surface, which might affect protein stability. Thus, the effects of the expansion as well as the insertion of polyglutamine on the stability of the protein were examined. We monitored the molar ellipticity at 222 nm in CD spectra and the absorbance at the Soret band in UV-visible spectra during unfolding and refolding of wild-type and mutant Mbs and evaluated the stability of the overall or heme environmental structures, respectively. To unfold and refold holo-Mb reversibly, we used the cyano form of holo-Mbs and GdmCl as a denaturant (9Luo Y. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Fig.6 shows the GdmCl-induced unfolding processes of wild-type and mutant cyano-Mbs monitored by the molar ellipticity at 222 nm (Fig. 6 A) and the absorbance at 419 nm (Fig. 6 B). The transition curves under these conditions confirmed the two states and reversibility (data not shown). From the sigmoidal curves, we calculated the concentration of GdmCl at the midpoint of the unfolding/refolding transition (Cm ), which is an index of protein stability (9Luo Y. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The decrease in Cm values obtained from both CD and UV-visible spectra of the mutant Mbs relative to those of wild-type Mb indicated that the insertion of the glutamine repeat destabilized both overall and heme environmental structures. We then examined the effects of extending the glutamine repeat on protein stability by plotting Cm values against the number of glutamine repeats (Fig. 6 C). InCm calculated from the CD spectra, the decreases in Cm values of the mutant Mbs were dependent on the number of glutamine repeats. The extent of the decrease inCm of Gln35 and Gln50mutants relative to that of wild-type Mb was unambiguously enhanced compared with that of the Gln12 and Gln28mutants. In contrast, the Cm values from UV-visible spectra did not show substantial changes between mutant Mbs, indicating that the stability of the heme environment was insensitive to up to about 50 glutamine repeats. The formation of the antiparallel β-pleated sheet of the expanded polyglutamine was confirmed by the IR spectra because the peak at 1634 cm−1 in the difference IR spectra revealed that the 28, 35, and 50 glutamine repeats inserted into the mutant Mbs formed an intramolecular β-sheet (13Dong A. Matsuura J. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The formation of the antiparallel β-pleated sheet is consistent with the results of the CD spectra. The difference CD spectra with negative peaks at 206 and 223 nm, which correspond to the spectra of the inserted polyglutamine, closely resemble that of the type I β-turn (20Parczel A. Hollosi M. Sandor P. Fasman G.D. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993; 41: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Since molar ellipticity of the β-sheet is approximately 2-fold smaller than that of the type I β-turn (20Parczel A. Hollosi M. Sandor P. Fasman G.D. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1993; 41: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the CD spectra of polyglutamine would be dominated by that of the type I β-turn rather than the β-sheet. The peak at 1674 cm−1 in the difference IR spectra of Gln50 Mb also supports the presence of the β-turn in the expanded polyglutamine (12Dong A. Huang O. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar, 13Dong A. Matsuura J. Manning M.C. Carpenter J.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the IR spectrum of Gln12 did not show a peak at 1634 cm−1, indicating that a short glutamine repeat did not form an intramolecular β-pleated sheet or that such a short β-sheet of 12 glutamines was undetectable in the difference IR spectrum. Gln50 Mb forms an intramolecular β-pleated sheet, and the Gln50 aggregates have an intermolecular antiparallel β-pleated sheet as evidenced by IR spectra (Fig. 3 B). Since wild-type myoglobin does not possess any β-sheet structures, it is likely that the β-pleated sheet formed by the expanded polyglutamine induced the formation of aggregates by its intermolecular interactions. The failure to detect the Gln50 aggregates at the gel top by 1C2 antibody demonstrated that the polyglutamine repeat inserted in myoglobin forms a core of the aggregates. The Gln50 aggregates were found to contain amyloid fibrils as shown by Congo red binding and birefringence. The presence of amyloid fibers agrees well with the huntingtin aggregates in R6/2 HD model mice and the GST-huntingtin(exon1) fusion protein aggregates (2Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L. Hollenbach B. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Davies S.W. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 21McGowan D.P. van Roon-Mom W. Holloway H. Bates G.P. Mangiarini L. Cooper G.J. Faull R.L. Snell R.G. Neuroscience. 2000; 100: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Despite the close similarity of the mutant Mbs to proteins for CAG repeat diseases, we found that one difference was certainly observed between them. Although 28 repeats of glutamine in huntingtin and SCA1 proteins were not detected by 1C2 antibody, the 28-repeat length was enough to react with 1C2 in the mutant Mb (1Trottier Y. Lutz Y. Stevanin G. Imbert G. Devys D. Cancel G. Saudou F. Weber C. David G. Tora L. Agid Y. Brice A. Mandel J.-L. Nature. 1995; 378: 403-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). This inconsistency might be caused by the fact that the polyglutamine in mutant Mbs has been designed to be located entirely on the protein surface. The location of the whole polyglutamine insert on the protein surface in the Gln28 mutant would improve the reactivity with 1C2 antibody. Conversely, the difference in the reactivity against 1C2 between the mutant Mbs and proteins for CAG repeat diseases implies that the β-strand of polyglutamine in the latter is partially covered with the other structures and buried in the protein. Since the border of the glutamine repeat between normal individuals and patients varies among CAG repeat diseases, this study suggests that the extent to which polyglutamine is exposed to solvent determines the repeat number of glutamine at the boundary between normal and affected individuals. The length dependence in the reaction between 1C2 and polyglutamine suggests that 1C2 detects a unique conformation that requires a minimum length of polyglutamine and that it is stabilized by further lengthening of glutamine repeat. Our data suggest that 1C2 recognizes the type I β-turn of polyglutamine that appeared on the protein surface after expansion of the glutamine repeat. The β-turn in the polyglutamine β-strand would be stabilized by the expansion of the glutamine repeat since participation of more glutamine residues in the formation of the β-pleated sheet increases the rigidity of the β-turn as well as of the β-strand itself. Thus, 1C2 would more strongly detect the “rigid type I β-turn,” which is stabilized by the expansion of the glutamine repeat. Although it is most plausible that the β-strand of polyglutamine induces the formation of aggregates by intermolecular interactions, we cannot deny that expanded polyglutamine seriously affects conformation in other regions of the protein, which facilitates the formation of aggregates. In the present study, the features of the1H NMR spectra were not affected by the expansion of the glutamine repeat. Since 1H NMR spectra are amenable to subtle coordinational changes in the heme group and several heme environmental residues (22Rajarathnam K. La Mar G.N. Chiu M.L. Sligar S.G. Singh J.P. Smith K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 7886-7892Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 23Rajarathnam K. Qin J. La Mar G.N. Chiu M.L. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5670-5680Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we concluded that structural changes in the protein interior, heme, and heme environment upon expansion of the glutamine repeat would be rather small. Further structural information was obtained by fluorescence spectroscopy. The similar redshift of the emission maximum of Gln35 and Gln50 Mbs to that of wild-type Mb at pH 4.2 suggested the molten globule-like state of the Mb mutants (19Eliezer D. Yao J. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 24Fink A.L. Oberg K.A. Seshadri S. Fold. Des. 1998; 3: 19-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Such redshift of the emission maximum of the mutant Mbs was also encountered for the carbonic anhydrase in the molten globule state (25Rajarathnam K. Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27595-27600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, the negative peak at 1661 cm−1 in the difference IR spectra suggests that some of the α-helices are unwound in the mutants. Therefore, the mutant Mbs would have the intact protein core and the fluctuating protein surface as is observed for molten globules (18Jennings P.A. Wright P.E. Science. 1993; 262: 92-96Crossref Scopus (773) Google Scholar,19Eliezer D. Yao J. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The surface unfolding upon expansion of glutamine repeats corresponded well with the protein stability experiment. Fig. 6 C shows that the overall structures of Gln35 and Gln50 mutant Mbs were seriously destabilized, whereas the stability of the protein core was not affected by the expansion of polyglutamine. In other words, the severe destabilization of the overall structure in the Gln35 and Gln50 mutants is attributed to destabilization of protein surface. On the basis of our results, we propose the following formation mechanism of aggregates in the proteins with expanded polyglutamine. The antiparallel β-pleated sheet of polyglutamine in a nonpathological length is evolutionally stabilized in the protein and is not exposed to solvent. Once the glutamine repeat is expanded to a pathological length, the end of the β-pleated sheet of the expanded polyglutamine breaks through the protein surface, causing its destabilization and partial unfolding of the protein surface. This would render the exposed polyglutamine more fluctuating and accessible to another molecule. The expanded polyglutamine exposed on the protein surface readily forms intermolecular antiparallel β-sheets, and accumulation of the polyglutamine β-strands results in aggregates. Such correlation of tendency to form aggregates with destabilization of a native state has been recently reported for various mutants of a globular protein, acylphosphatase (26Chiti F. Taddei N. Bucciantini M. White P. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1441-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This scheme of aggregate formation can be applied to the processing model in which a full-length protein is cleaved before formation of aggregate because an expanded polyglutamine destabilizes the processed smaller fragment more severely than its native full-length molecule. In the present study, we have established a molecular model for polyglutamine diseases using sperm whale myoglobin. This is the first successful isolation and structural characterization of the protein in which various lengths of polyglutamine including a pathological repeat number were inserted. The mutant Mbs in this study would be applied for further studies such as the screening of small molecules that inhibit the formation of polyglutamine aggregates.

However, the metabolic mechanisms that confer resistance to injury are poorly understood. Phosphotransfer reactions integrate ATP-consuming with ATP-producing processes and could thereby contribute to the generation of a protective phenotype. Here, we used ischemic preconditioning to induce a stress-tolerant state and 18O-assisted31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to capture intracellular phosphotransfer dynamics. Preconditioning of isolated perfused hearts triggered a redistribution in phosphotransfer flux with significant increase in creatine kinase and glycolytic rates. High energy phosphoryl fluxes through creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, and glycolysis in preconditioned hearts correlated tightly with post-ischemic functional recovery. This was associated with enhanced metabolite exchange between subcellular compartments, manifested by augmented transfer of inorganic phosphate from cellular ATPases to mitochondrial ATP synthase. Preconditioning-induced energetic remodeling protected cellular ATP synthesis and ATP consumption, improving contractile performance following ischemia-reperfusion insult. Thus, the plasticity of phosphotransfer networks contributes to the effective functioning of the cellular energetic system, providing a mechanism for increased tolerance toward injury.

Alterations in cellular energy metabolism triggered by ischemic preconditioning, including a characteristic creatine phosphate overshoot, indicates that this protective process targets phosphotransfer reactions (24Jennings R.B.

However, direct evidence demonstrating the protective role of phosphotransfer networks in the preconditioned state is still lacking.Here, we demonstrate that ischemic preconditioning of heart muscle induces remodeling in cellular energy transduction, transfer, and utilization processes, thereby promoting preservation of energy metabolism. Post-ischemic contractile recovery was tightly associated with preconditioning-induced adjustment in metabolic flux through creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, and glycolytic systems. Thus, preconditioning shifts intracellular phosphotransfer networks into a stress-tolerant mode rendering heart muscle more resistant to metabolic injury.DISCUSSIONInduction of the cytoprotective response is fundamental to cell survival under stress, and yet the mechanisms underlying acquired tolerance to metabolic injury are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate by the novel approach of 18O/31P NMR analysis the importance of intracellular phosphotransfer pathways in producing a stress-tolerant cellular energetic phenotype. Preconditioning induced redistribution of high energy phosphoryl transfer through individual phosphotransfer reactions catalyzed by creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, and glycolytic enzymes, leading to an improved intracellular metabolic communication and preservation of cellular ATP synthesis and ATP consumption processes. Thus, the present study establishes that adaptive remodeling of the cellular energetic system is an integral mechanism in ischemic preconditioning-induced cell resistance to stress.The energetic homeostasis of the cell and, consequently, energy-driven cellular functions require tight coordination between ATP utilization and ATP generation (38Dzeja P.P.

Here, phosphotransfer dynamics were dissected by18O/31P NMR spectroscopy, which allowed simultaneous capture of net phosphotransfer flux through individual enzymes, as well as total ATP production and consumption rates in intact heart muscle. In nonconditioned hearts, a prolonged ischemia-reperfusion challenge produced a marked reduction in the rates of creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, and glycolysis-catalyzed phosphotransfer, contributing to energetic and contractile dysfunction of the post-ischemic myocardium. Phosphotransfer deficit further disrupted intracellular handling of Pi, resulting in the accumulation of nascent Pi at ATPase sites and impaired delivery to mitochondrial ATP synthase. A restricted mobility of intracellular Pi could be the result of functional entrapment and/or physical diffusional restriction due to the viscosity and high structural organization of the muscle cytosol (15Dzeja P.P.

With short-term hypoxia, the drop in creatine kinase flux is usually compensated for by increased adenylate kinase and/or glycolytic flux (22Pucar D. Janssen E. Dzeja P.P. Juranic N. Macura S.

Thus, defective phosphotransfer networking, associated with a reduced rate of ATP turnover, precipitates poor myocardial recovery in the nonconditioned myocardium following ischemia-reperfusion.Preconditioning improves myocardial post-ischemic contractile recovery and provides protection from metabolic injury (4Jennings R.B. Steenbergen C. Reimer K.A. Monogr. Pathol. 1995; 37: 47-80PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cohen M.V. Baines C.P. Downey J.M. Annu. Rev.

In the present study, by 18O/31P NMR analysis of myocardial phosphotransfer dynamics we found that preconditioning up-regulates creatine kinase phosphotransfer flux associated with higher levels of CrP and an improved CrP/Piratio. This finding supports the notion that preconditioning-induced creatine phosphate overshoot is required for generation of the protective phenotype (24Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A. Annu. Rev. Med. 1991; 42: 225-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 25Takeo S. Nasa Y. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26Hassinen I.E. Vuorinen K.H.

In addition to the creatine kinase system, preconditioning also markedly increased glycolytic phosphotransfer associated with higher lactate and α-glycerophosphate levels. Previous studies have indicated increased glucose utilization and reduced glycogenolysis in preconditioning, leading to maintained glycolytic flux at reperfusion (25Takeo S. Nasa Y. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Weiss R.G. de Albuquerque C.P. Vandegaer K. Chacko V.P. Gerstenblith G. Circ.

Traditionally, glycolytic metabolism has been identified as an alternative source of myocardial ATP production. The present finding supports an additional role for glycolysis in transferring and distributing high energy phosphoryls in line with vigorous phosphoryl exchange rates in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/3-phosphoglycerate kinase system observed with31P NMR saturation transfer (47Sako E.Y.

Robitaille P.M. From A.H. Foker J.E. Ugurbil K. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7501-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In fact, increased phosphotransfer in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/3-phosphoglycerate couple could be responsible for improved intracellular Pi trafficking (15Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Dzeja P.P. Pucar D. Redfield M.M. Burnett J.C. Terzic A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 201: 33-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed in preconditioning hearts. In contrast to the increased contribution of creatine kinase and glycolytic flux, adenylate kinase phosphotransfer in the preconditioned myocardium showed an apparent trend toward down-regulation. This finding may suggest increased competition with creatine kinase and glycolytic systems leading to redistribution of intracellular phosphotransfer flux. Thus, in the preconditioned mode, cellular phosphotransfer equilibrium would operate at a new steady state conditioning cells to withstand subsequent metabolic stress.The remodeling of cellular metabolism has been considered as a contributor to metabolic defense (22Pucar D.

A. 1999; 96: 12233-12239Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Apparently, the plasticity of cellular energetic dynamics materializes in a more efficient coupling of ATP turnover with cellular functions. Tight correlation was discovered here between metabolic fluxes through creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, and glycolytic phosphotransfer and contractile recovery of post-ischemic hearts. The close correlation between phosphotransfer flux and heart muscle performance in the post-ischemic state suggests that phosphotransfer reactions are an obligatory route channeling the flow of high energy phosphoryls. Thus, integrated cellular energetics contributes to the preconditioned phenotype by translating metabolic adaptation into increased stress tolerance.The sequences of events leading to the development of a preconditioning state are still not fully understood. However, a number of signal transduction cascades, including protein kinases and ion channels, have been implicated as triggers and/or effectors of the protective phenotype (4Jennings R.B. Steenbergen C. Reimer K.A. Monogr. Pathol. 1995; 37: 47-80PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cohen M.V. Baines C.P. Downey J.M. Annu. Rev.

Holmuhamedov E.L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1911-1915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Rapid alterations in cellular energetics induced by ischemic preconditioning could trigger signal transduction events by changing the cellular phosphorylation potential. Indeed, there is a close relationship between creatine kinase phosphotransfer and the activity of protein kinase C, believed to be critical in early stages of preconditioning (49Wallimann T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). Moreover, adenylate kinase phosphotransfer, through AMP-driven signaling, modulates the behavior of the AMP-activated protein kinase, a metabolic stress kinase (50Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Hawley S.A. Davies S.P. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Furthermore, intracellular phosphotransfer reactions regulate the behavior of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels, an alarm mechanism setting membrane excitability in response to metabolic stress (15Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 42Carrasco A.J. Dzeja P.P. Alekseev A.E. Pucar D. Zingman L.V. Abraham M.R. Hodgson D. Bienengraeber M. Puceat M.

Karger A.B. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. Neuron. 2001; 31: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In turn, both protein kinase C and AMP-activated protein kinase regulate creatine kinase phosphotransfer rate and other metabolic pathways through phosphorylation of target proteins (49Wallimann T. Wyss M. Brdiczka D. Nicolay K. Eppenberger H.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1583) Google Scholar, 56Ponticos M. Lu Q.L. Morgan J.E. Hardie D.G. Partridge T.A. Carling D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1688-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Thus, the feedback communication between stress-sensitive metabolic and signal transduction events may be central to the generation of the preconditioned state.In summary, this study has uncovered a homeostatic mechanism by which cells induce a preconditioned energetic state conferring increased tolerance toward injury. This is accomplished by a coordinated redistribution of high energy phosphoryl flux through phosphotransfer enzymes allowing more efficient communication of energetic signals and preservation of ATP generation and consumption processes. In this way, intracellular phosphotransfer reactions emerge as an essential component required for the development of an injury-tolerant state and could thereby serve as a target for regulating the cellular response to stress. Cells with high energy turnover are particularly vulnerable to insults induced by deprivation of oxygen and metabolic substrates (1Otterbein L.E. Bach F.H. Alam J. Soares M. Tao Lu H. Wysk M.

However, the actual mechanisms responsible for preservation of cellular energetic systems and, ultimately, functional recovery remain poorly understood. In the heart, coupling of energetics with contractile function is facilitated through phosphotransfer relays, catalyzed by creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, and glycolysis (11Dzeja P.P.

To address this concern, a series of single, double, and triple streptavidin muteins with different affinities to biotin were designed.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1157-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) indicate that three major mechanisms contribute to the tight binding between streptavidin and biotin. These include the hydrophobic interactions between biotin and the four tryptophan residues (Trp-79, Trp-92, Trp-108, and Trp-120) in streptavidin, the interaction with a flexible loop (residues 45–52) in streptavidin, and a series of hydrogen-bonding interactions involving eight residues (Asn-23, Ser-27, Tyr-43, Ser-45, Asn-49, Ser-88, Thr-90, and Asp-128) of streptavidin (Fig. 1). Since individual interactions via hydrogen bonding in general are relatively weak (24Fersht A.R. Shi J.P. Knill-Jones J. Lowe D.M. Wilkinson A.J. Blow D.M. Brick P. Carter P. Waye M.M. Winter G. Nature. 1985; 314: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar), replacement of streptavidin residues critical to hydrogen-bonding interactions with biotin by site-directed mutagenesis would allow one to fine tune the binding affinity of streptavidin to biotin. In this study, the roles of key residues involved in hydrogen bonding with the two ureido-nitrogens (Ser-45 and Asp-128) and a sulfur (Thr-90) in biotin were examined. Three single, two double, and one triple streptavidin mutants were constructed, and these mutant proteins (muteins) were produced as soluble proteins via secretion usingBacillus subtilis. 1S.-C. Wu, M. H. Qureshi, and S.-L. Wong, manuscript submitted. Interestingly two (Thr-90 and Asp-128) of three target residues characterized affect not only the interaction between streptavidin and biotin but also the interactions between streptavidin subunits. This leads to the generation of a mixture of tetrameric and monomeric muteins. Combination of all three mutations together results in a triple mutant that produces streptavidin solely in the monomeric form independent of the presence or absence of biotin. Kinetic parameters including on-rate, off-rate, and dissociation constant of each purified mutein and the wild-type control were determined in real time to examine the streptavidin-biotin interaction by using the surface plasmon resonance-based BIAcore biosensor. The results showed that the streptavidin muteins have a wide range of dissociation constants (10−6–10−11m). The effects of these mutations on biotin binding and subunit interactions in streptavidin are discussed. Construction of streptavidin mutants was based on the principle of cassette mutagenesis using a synthetic streptavidin gene (ssav) in the B. subtilis expression vector (pSSAV-Tcry) as the template.1 ssavencodes the full-length intact form of streptavidin. Different point mutations were introduced to the coding sequence of ssav by using the PCR2-based oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. In the first phase, three mutants (SM1 to SM3), each with a single mutation, were constructed using mutagenic primers SAVHNF1, SAVD128AF, and SAVHNB1 (TableI and Fig. 2). For the construction of SM1(S45A), because of the presence of two SacI sites in pSSAV-Tcry, it was not possible to clone the amplified PCR fragment digested with SacI and MscI into pSSAV-Tcry. Instead pSSAV-Tcry was digested withHindIII and SphI, and the isolatedssav fragment was cloned into the polylinker region of a modified Escherichia coli Bluescript vector pBS (Stratagene) in which the SacI site in the polylinker region has already been removed by end-repairing and religation treatments. The resulting vector was designated pBM-SAV. The PCR-amplified fragment for SM1(S45A) was first digested with SacI and MscI and then applied to replace the SacI-MscI fragment in pBM-SAV to generate pBM-SAV1 (Fig. 2 A). Finally, theHindIII-SphI expression cassette from pBM-SAV1 was transferred back into pSSAV-Tcry to generate pSM1. To create the second (SM2(D128A)) and third (SM3(T90A)) single mutants, the respective amplified PCR fragment was digested withScaI/SphI andHindIII/MscI, respectively, and directly cloned into the pSSAV-Tcry vector to generate pSM2 and pSM3, respectively (Fig. 2 B). In the next phase, two double streptavidin mutants (S45A,T90A and S45A,D128A) were constructed based upon the already constructed three single mutants. First, double mutant DM1(S45A,T90A) was made by replacing anEcoRI/BamHI-digested fragment in pSM3 with that from pSM1 to generate pDM1. In a similar approach, the second double mutant DM2(S45A,D128A) was made by digesting pSM1 (with the S45A mutation) and pSM2 (with the D128A mutation) with EcoRI andBamHI and replacing the insert in pSM2 with that from pSM1 to generate pDM2. In the final phase, a triple mutant TM1(S45A,T90A,D128A) was constructed by digesting pSM2 (with the D128A mutation) and pDM1 (with both S45A and T90A mutations) withEcoRI and ScaI, and the isolated insert from pDM1 was inserted to the EcoRI/ScaI-digested pSM2 vector to generate pTM1(Fig. 2 C). The coding sequences of all the mutated streptavidin genes were confirmed to be correct by nucleotide sequencing.Table IMutagenic primers for the construction of streptavidin mutantsNucleotides that are different from the sequence in the template are indicated in bold and underlined.

Expression vectors carrying mutated streptavidin genes were transformed toB. subtilis WB800, an eight protease-deficient strain (26Wu S.-C. Yeung J.C. Szarka S.J.

International Business Communications USA Conferences Inc., Westborough, MA2000Google Scholar), for streptavidin production via secretion as described previously1 with some modifications. Cells were grown in a semidefined medium, modified casamino acid medium, for 24 h at 32°C and separated from the medium by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The pH of the culture supernatant was adjusted to 4.4 by the addition of a 0.5 msuccinic acid solution containing 10 mm EDTA and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The supernatant was then applied to a cation-exchange column (2.8 × 8 cm) packed with Macro-Prep High S (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with equilibration buffer (100 mm succinic acid, pH 4.4, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF). The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of equilibration buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 ml of equilibration buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and dialyzed overnight against 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 9.8, containing 0.5 m NaCl. The dialyzed sample was then applied to a 2-iminobiotin-agarose affinity column (Sigma) equilibrated with 100 mm Na2CO3, pH 9.8, containing 0.5 m NaCl. After washing, streptavidin was eluted with 0.1 m glycine buffer, pH 2.8. The buffer of the pooled fractions was changed to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm EDTA and 1 mm PMSF by using centrifugal filtering devices (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The purified proteins were used for further analysis. For streptavidin muteins that existed in both tetrameric and monomeric forms, fractions containing streptavidin eluted from the 2-iminobiotin-agarose column were applied to a Sephacryl S-100 (2- × 30-cm) column at 4 °C equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF. The tetrameric form was separated from the monomeric form. Fractions for each form were desalted and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Purified streptavidin muteins were incubated with 500 μmbiotin at room temperature for 30 min and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Evaluation of kinetic parameters (k on and k off) was performed by using a surface plasmon resonance-based BIAcoreX biosensor (BIAcore Inc.). In these analyses, BSA was conjugated with biotin and coupled to a CM5 sensor chip. Biotin-conjugated BSA was prepared by incubating 2 mg of BSA with 1 mg of N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of biotin (NHS-biotin, Pierce) in 50 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for up to 2 h. The molar ratio of biotin to BSA under the reaction condition was 60:1. Unreacted NHS and NHS byproducts were removed by ultrafiltration involving three washes with 50 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 8.0, and one wash with 50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 6.5. The conjugate was immobilized on the dextran matrix of the sensor chip using the amine coupling kit (BIAcore Inc.) with the procedures specified by the manufacturer. There are two flow cells per sensor chip for the BIAcoreX system. The conjugate was immobilized in the first flow cell (FC-1) to 700 resonance units. BSA was immobilized in the second flow cell (FC-2) to 950 resonance units as a negative control for background correction. Solutions containing streptavidin at different concentrations (20–200 nm) were passed through the flow cells at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. After completion of each run, the sensor chip was regenerated with a 2.5-min pulse of 100 mm NaOH containing 4m NaCl and 2 μm biotin at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. A three-step scheme was applied to determine the on-rate (association rate constant,k a) for the streptavidin-biotin interaction. Binding of streptavidin to biotin-conjugated BSA immobilized to the sensor chip is reflected by the increase in resonance units with time. In the first step, the change in resonance units with time was plotted at different concentrations of streptavidin injected. This allows the determination of the binding rate (dR/dt with Rrepresenting the resonance unit) at each concentration of streptavidin used in the study. In the second step, the binding rates at different concentrations of streptavidin injected were plotted against the response (expressed in terms of resonance units R) according to the kinetic equation dR/dt = −(k a C +k d)R +k a CR max (27O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 323-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This yielded a series of straight lines (one line per concentration of streptavidin injected). The slope of each line (designated k s) represents the value of k a C +k d (i.e. k s =k a C + k d). In the third step, the k s values generated with different concentrations (C = 20–200 nm) of streptavidin were plotted against the concentration of streptavidin injected. A straight line should be generated, and the slope of this line represents k a (Fig. 6 A). At the end of injection, the streptavidin sample was displaced by the injection of binding buffer, and the dissociation of streptavidin was monitored for 60 min. The off-rate (dissociation rate constant,k d) was determined based on the equation ln(R 0/R t) =k d (t − t 0) (27O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 323-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). By plotting ln(R 0/R t)versus (t − t 0), the off-rate (k d) for streptavidin to dissociate from biotin-conjugated BSA was determined (Fig. 6 B). All these measurements were performed at 25°C. All PCRs were carried out using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs). The PCR conditions, plasmid isolation, DNA transformation, Western blotting, and nucleotide sequencing were performed as described previously (28Wu X.-C. Nathoo S. Pang A.S.H. Carne T. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6845-6850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Wu S.-C. Ye R. Wu X.-C. Ng S.-C. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2830-2835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of purified streptavidin was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 41,820m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm (30Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar) for streptavidin. The molecular weight of tetrameric and monomeric forms of streptavidin was determined by gel filtration using a Bio-Rad biologic work station with a Bio-Prep S.E. 100/17 column (Bio-Rad) calibrated with protein standards. For viewing the three-dimensional structure of the streptavidin-biotin complex (PDB code 1SWE), the Swiss-Pdb viewer program (31Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9590) Google Scholar) was used. To analyze the interatomic contacts and solvent-accessible areas of Ser-45, Thr-90, and Asp-128 in the streptavidin-biotin complex, web-based computer programs (32Sobolev V. Sorokine A. Prilusky J. Abola E.E. Edelman M. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) including ligand-protein contacts (LPC software) and contacts of structural units (CSU software) were used. To develop a series of streptavidin muteins with a wide range of affinity toward biotin, the role of three residues located at strategic positions that form hydrogen bonds with biotin was studied (Fig.1). Asp-128 and Ser-45 interact with the two biotin ureido-nitrogen atoms, while Thr-90 interacts with the sulfur atom in biotin. Each of them was changed to alanine to generate three single mutants designated SM1(S45A), SM2(D128A), and SM3(T90A), respectively, via the PCR-based cassette mutagenesis (Fig.2, A and B) involving a synthetic streptavidin gene.1 To examine whether the combination of these single mutations together would further reduce the interactions between streptavidin and biotin, two double mutants, DM1(S45A,T90A) and DM2(S45A,D128A), and one triple mutant TM1(S45A,T90A,D128A) were constructed (Fig. 2 C). In the expression vector, the B. subtilis levansucrase (SacB) signal sequence was applied to direct the secretion of streptavidin muteins to the culture medium. B. subtilis WB800, an eight extracellular protease-deficient strain, served as the expression host. The use of this host is important since the production yield of the secreted streptavidin muteins is about 2-fold higher in most cases in comparison with the use of WB700, a seven extracellular protease-deficient strain, as the host. Streptavidin and its muteins were secreted as soluble proteins in the culture medium.1 If the streptavidin-containing culture supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE without boiling, wild-type streptavidin migrated solely in the tetrameric form with an apparent molecular mass around 85 kDa (Fig. 3). With single point mutations, streptavidin muteins under the nonboiling condition migrated in both tetrameric and monomeric forms to different degrees depending on the nature of the mutation. Mutein SM1(S45A) showed the mildest effect on subunit dissociation. With multiple independent analyses, 90–100% of the SM1 mutein migrated in the tetrameric form with the remaining as monomers (Figs. 3 and 5 and TableII). SM3(T90A) mutein showed a higher percentage (45–55%) in the monomeric form. The mutation involving Asp-128 had the greatest effect on subunit dissociation with an average of 86% of the SM2 mutein migrating in the monomeric form. This indicates that different mutations could induce different degrees of conformational change, which weakens the subunit interactions in streptavidin. A net result of combining all three mutations (TM1) resulted in the production of streptavidin solely in the monomeric state (Fig. 3).Figure 5Effect of biotin binding on subunit association of streptavidin muteins.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether different forms of streptavidin muteins still retained the iminobiotin binding ability, a 2-iminobiotin-agarose column (33Hofmann K. Wood S.W. Brinton C.C. Montibeller J.A. Finn F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4666-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) was used in the second step of a two-step purification scheme. Without overloading the column, all streptavidin molecules including both the monomeric and tetrameric forms were bound to the column as determined by the SDS-PAGE analysis of the flow-through and the elution fractions. To determine whether the monomeric streptavidin muteins really existed in solution or they were formed because of the presence of SDS under the condition for SDS-PAGE, streptavidin eluted from the 2-iminobiotin column was loaded to a Bio-Prep S.E. 100/17 gel-filtration column. Streptavidin muteins could be resolved into two peaks. The one eluted earlier corresponded to the tetrameric form of the streptavidin mutein (with an apparent molecular mass of 78 kDa), while the second elution peak corresponded to the monomeric mutein (with an apparent molecular mass of 18.4 kDa, Fig.4). The percentage of each form of the streptavidin muteins correlated well with those observed by SDS-PAGE. These observations indicate that the monomeric form of streptavidin muteins naturally exists in solution and is not formed because of the presence of SDS under the electrophoretic condition. To examine whether the monomeric streptavidin muteins can assemble into tetrameric form at a higher concentration, the purified monomeric streptavidin muteins from SM2(D128A) and SM3(T90A) were concentrated 23- and 15-fold, respectively, by ultrafiltration. The concentrated samples had a final concentration of 1.86 μg/liter for SM2 and 0.88 μg/liter for SM3. These samples were loaded separately to the Bio-Prep S.E. gel-filtration column. The elution profiles indicated that the monomeric streptavidin muteins remained in the monomeric state (data not shown). In contrast, wild-type streptavidin remained in the tetrameric state in a concentration-independent manner (0.06–2.3 μg/liter) if these samples were not boiled before loading to SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Biotin binding is known to strengthen the interaction between streptavidin subunits (34Bayer E.A. Ehrlichrogozinski S. Wilchek M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 35Gonzalez M. Argarana C.E. Fidelio G.D. Biomol. Eng. 1999; 16: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It would be of interest to examine whether biotin can induce monomeric streptavidin muteins to self-assemble into tetrameric form. To some extent, promotion of tetramerization of the monomeric form of streptavidin muteins from SM1(S45A) and SM2(D128A) in the presence of biotin was observed (Fig.5 A). In contrast, the effect of biotin on oligomerization of monomeric SM3(T90A) mutein was insignificant. For double (DM1 and DM2) and triple (TM1) mutants, addition of biotin did not improve tetramerization of these muteins to any significant extent (Fig. 5 B). To examine the mutagenic effects of S45A, T90A, and D128A in streptavidin on biotin binding, both on-rate and off-rate of the purified forms of wild-type and mutant streptavidin proteins were determined using the surface plasmon resonance-based BIAcore biosensor with biotin-conjugated BSA immobilized on the sensor chip (Fig. 6). The data are summarized in Table II. Wild-type streptavidin has an on-rate of 5.13 × 106m−1 s−1. The off-rate is beyond the measurable limit of the biosensor system since the dissociation reaction is too slow. For the three single mutants (SM1 to SM3), a general trend concerning the on-rate could be observed depending on whether these muteins existed in the tetrameric or monomeric state. If the muteins existed in the tetrameric state, the on-rates were usually not significantly affected (less than 5.2-fold). In contrast, a more drastic decrease in on-rate could be observed when these muteins existed in the monomeric state. Such a drastic change in on-rate reflected some structural changes in the subunit that led to poor subunit interactions. For the off-rates, monomeric muteins also consistently showed a higher off-rate than their respective tetrameric muteins. In the case of tetrameric SM1(S45A), the observed increase in the dissociation constant was mainly because of the increase in the off-rate. For both SM2(D128A) and SM3(T90A), these muteins existed in both monomeric and tetrameric forms. The increase in off-rate of the tetrameric muteins reflected more closely the importance of Asp-128 and Thr-90 in hydrogen bonding with biotin in these muteins. Among the three residues examined, the impact of Thr-90 in hydrogen bonding with biotin was less than Ser-45 and Asp-128. In the monomeric state, changes in both the on- and off-rates led to the observed increase in the dissociation constants. This reflects a combined effect of the mutation on both the hydrogen bonding to biotin and the structural changes in streptavidin subunits. As reflected by the degree of monomeric streptavidin formed, the importance of the three r"

In this study we evaluate the effect of a novel class of PKC ligands, the diacylglycerol (DAG)-lactones, as inducers of apoptosis in LNCaP cells. These unique ligands were designed using novel pharmacophore- and receptor-guided approaches to achieve highly potent DAG surrogates. Two of these compounds, HK434 and HK654, induced apoptosis in LNCaP cells with much higher potency than oleoyl-acetyl-glycerol or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate. Moreover, different PKC isozymes were found to mediate the apoptotic effect of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and HK654 in LNCaP cells. Using PKC inhibitors and dominant negative PKC isoforms, we found that both PKCα and PKCδ mediated the apoptotic effect of PMA, whereas only PKCα was involved in the effect of the DAG-lactone. The PKCα selectivity of HK654 in LNCaP cells contrasts with similar potencies in vitro for binding and activation of PKCα and PKCδ. Consistent with the differences in isoform dependence in intact cells, PMA and HK654 show marked differences in their abilities to translocate PKC isozymes. Both PMA and HK654 induce a marked redistribution of PKCα to the plasma membrane. On the other hand, unlike PMA, HK654 translocates PKCδ predominantly to the nuclear membrane. Thus, DAG-lactones have a unique profile of activation of PKC isozymes for inducing apoptosis in LNCaP cells and represent the first example of a selective activator of a classical PKC in cellular models. An attractive hypothesis is that selective activation of PKC isozymes by pharmacological agents in cells can be achieved by differential intracellular targeting of each PKC.

Using PKC inhibitors and dominant negative PKC isoforms, we found that both PKCα and PKCδ mediated the apoptotic effect of PMA, whereas only PKCα was involved in the effect of the DAG-lactone. The PKCα selectivity of HK654 in LNCaP cells contrasts with similar potencies in vitro for binding and activation of PKCα and PKCδ. Consistent with the differences in isoform dependence in intact cells, PMA and HK654 show marked differences in their abilities to translocate PKC isozymes. Both PMA and HK654 induce a marked redistribution of PKCα to the plasma membrane. On the other hand, unlike PMA, HK654 translocates PKCδ predominantly to the nuclear membrane. Thus, DAG-lactones have a unique profile of activation of PKC isozymes for inducing apoptosis in LNCaP cells and represent the first example of a selective activator of a classical PKC in cellular models. An attractive hypothesis is that selective activation of PKC isozymes by pharmacological agents in cells can be achieved by differential intracellular targeting of each PKC. protein kinase C diacylglycerol phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole classical PKC novel PKC atypical PKC adenovirus multiplicity of infection plaque-forming unit(s) dominant negative fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline green fluorescent protein Chinese hamster ovary The phorbol esters and related diterpenes are natural compounds that have been for many years the preferred pharmacological tools for studying protein kinase C (PKC),1 a key family of kinases implicated in growth factor- and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling. These compounds mimic the action of the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG), a relatively simple and highly flexible molecule generated by cellular phospholipases. The higher potency of phorbol esters and their greater stability compared with the second messenger DAG makes these agents the preferred activators of PKC (1Blumberg P.M. Mol.

Phorbol esters regulate a variety of cellular functions, including cell cycle progression, differentiation, cytoskeleton remodeling, and malignant transformation. Although phorbol esters promote mitogenesis in several cell types, accumulating data indicate that activation of PKC leads to inhibition of cell growth in many cells (3Livneh E. Fishman D.D. Eur. J.

Interestingly, phorbol esters induce apoptosis in several cell lines, including thymocytes, breast cancer cells, and prostate cancer cells (7Ojeda F. Guarda M.I. Maldonado C. Folch H. Diehl H. Int.

The heterogeneity of effects of the phorbol esters is related to the presence of multiple phorbol ester/DAG receptors, including PKC isozymes and “nonkinase” PKC receptors. The PKC family comprises at least 10 related kinases with differential expression, subcellular distribution and biochemical regulation. PKC isozymes have been classified into three subclasses according to their structure and regulation: “classical” or calcium-dependent (“cPKCs” α, βI, βII, and γ), “novel” or calcium-independent (“nPKCs” δ, ε, η, and θ), and “atypical” (“aPKCs” ζ and ι/λ). A related enzyme, PKCμ or protein kinase D, is a distant relative of the PKC isozymes. Although aPKCs are insensitive to phorbol esters and DAG, cPKCs and nPKCs bind phorbol esters with high affinity in the presence of phospholipids as cofactors. PKC isozymes are subject to exquisite regulatory mechanisms and can have either overlapping or opposite biological functions (13Jaken S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 14Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 15Newton A.C. Curr. Opin.

It is well established that activation of PKC by phorbol esters triggers an apoptotic response in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cells, such as LNCaP cells (10Day M.L. Zhao X. Wu S. Swanson P.E.

Powell C.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 1224-1234PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that phorbol ester-induced apoptosis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells correlates with a persistent translocation of PKCα to membranes. We have recently demonstrated that overexpression of PKCδ in LNCaP cells markedly potentiates phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced apoptosis, suggesting a role for PKCδ in the phorbol ester effect. Likewise, expression of a dominant negative (kinase-inactive) form of PKCδ partially inhibits PMA-induced apoptosis (17Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamaño J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L.

Therefore, multiple PKC isozymes may contribute to the apoptotic effect of phorbol esters in LNCaP cells. An interesting emerging concept is that PKC activators have varied, unique pharmacological profiles and exert in many cases discrete cellular responses. Differential responses to PKC activators have been observed for analogs such as bryostatin 1, mezerein, and 12-deoxyphorbol esters (1Blumberg P.M. Mol. Carcinog. 1991; 4: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 2Kazanietz M.G. Caloca M.J. Eroles P. Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Reilly M. Wang H.B. Biochem.

In this paper we focus on a novel class of synthetic analogs, the DAG-lactones, which bind with high potency to the phorbol ester/DAG binding site in PKC (the C1 domain). These novel C1 domain ligands were designed through a pharmacophore-guided approach based on the crystal coordinates of the C1b domain of PKCδ in complex with phorbol-13-acetate. Remarkably, the DAG-lactones show 3–4 orders of magnitude higher affinity for PKC isozymes than natural DAGs. To generate such potent DAGs, the glycerol backbone was constrained into a rigid structure (a lactone ring), resulting in a reduced entropic penalty associated with DAG binding to the receptor (19Teng K. Marquez V.E. Milne G.W.A. Barchi J.J. Kazanietz M.G. Lewin N.E. Blumberg P.M. Abushanab E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 1059-1070Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Benzaria S. Bienfait B.

Like phorbol esters and the natural DAGs in an “open conformation,” the DAG-lactones bind to PKC and induce its activation in vitro. Moreover, these simple DAG analogs have phorbol ester-like effects in cells, such as inhibition of epidermal growth factor binding, with potencies similar to that of PDBu. Some of these compounds have displayed important antitumor activity in thein vitro cell line screen of the NCI (National Institutes of Health), but their mechanism of action is largely unknown (22Nacro K. Bienfait B. Lee J. Han K.C. Kang J.H. Benzaria S. Lewin N.E. Bhattacharyya D.K. Blumberg P.M. Marquez V.E. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 921-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). No information is available on the specificity of the DAG-lactones for individual PKC isozymes. In this paper we show that DAG-lactones, like phorbol esters, induce apoptosis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. A remarkable finding is that DAG-lactones and PMA exert their apoptotic effect through the activation of a different subset of PKC isozymes, as revealed by a series of pharmacological and molecular approaches. Thus, DAG-lactones represent a novel template for the design of potent selective PKC agonists, which may be useful tools to dissect PKC isozyme-specific functions in cells. PMA was obtained from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). GF109203X, Gö6976, and rottlerin were purchased from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). The pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was purchased from Sigma. Cell culture reagents and media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2atmosphere. LNCaP cells overexpressing Bcl-2 (LNCaP-Neo/Bcl-2) and the corresponding control cells transfected with empty vector (LNCaP-Neo) (24Raffo A.J. Perlman H. Chen M.-W. Day M.L. Streitman J.S. Buttyan R.

Kinase-inactive PKCs were generated by an Arg to Lys substitution at the ATP-binding site of the catalytic domain, and the corresponding AdVs were then generated as described in Ref. 26Ohba M.

AdVs were amplified in HEK 293 cells using standard techniques (28Berkner K.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 158: 39-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Titers of viral stocks were normally higher than 1 × 109 pfu/cell. The absence of wild type AdV was confirmed by PCR using primers for the E1 region. An AdV for the LacZ gene (LacZAdV) was used as a control (17Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamaño J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Subconfluent LNCaP cells in 6- or 12-well plates were infected with AdVs for 14 h at multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) ranging from 1 to 30 pfu/cell (in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% FBS). Following infection, the medium was replaced with fresh RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and the cells were grown for an additional 24 h. Maximum expression of PKC isozymes after AdV infection was achieved with this protocol. Expression of recombinant protein remained stable for several days (17Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L.

Synthetic DAG-lactones, PMA, or vehicle (ethanol) were added for 1 h at different concentrations to either noninfected cells or to cells infected with different AdVs. After treatment, cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h. PKC inhibitors (GF 109203X, Gö6976, or rottlerin) or the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD were added 1 h before and during DAG-lactone or PMA treatment. Cells were harvested and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Equal amounts of protein (10 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated with a monoclonal anti-PKCα antibody (1:3000, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or a polyclonal anti-PKCδ antibody (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Membranes were washed three times with 0.2% Tween 20, PBS and incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000, Bio-Rad). Bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). LNCaP cells were transfected with vectors encoding GFP fusion proteins for PKCα and PKCδ (29Wang Q.J. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S. Nacro K. Marquez V.E. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37233-37239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Experiments were performed 3 days after transfection. Prior to observation, transiently transfected LNCaP cells were washed twice with standard medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without phenol red supplemented with 1% FBS) prewarmed to 37 °C. All PKC activators were diluted to specified concentrations in the same medium, and the final concentration of solvent (ethanol) was always less than 0.01%. For live cell imaging, the Bioptechs Focht Chamber System (FCS2) was inverted and attached to the microscope stage with a custom stage adapter. The cells cultured on a 40-mm round coverslip were introduced into the chamber system, which was connected to a temperature controller set at 37 °C, and medium was perfused through the chamber with a model P720 microperfusion pump (Instech, Plymouth Meeting, PA). As indicated, the perfusate to the chamber was changed to that containing the specified ligand for PKC and sequential images of the same cell were then collected at 1-min intervals using LaserSharp software through a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal scan head mounted on a Nikon Optiphot microscope with a 60× planapochromat lens. Excitation at 488 nm was provided by a krypton-argon gas laser with a 522/32 emission filter for green fluorescence. To assess morphological changes in chromatin structure, cells were stained with DAPI. Cells were then trypsinized, mounted on glass slides, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stained for 20 min with 1 mg/ml DAPI. Apoptosis was characterized by chromatin condensation and fragmentation when examined by fluorescence microscopy. The incidence of apoptosis in each preparation was analyzed by counting 500 cells and determining the percentage of apoptotic cells (17Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamaño J. Ohba M.

DNA laddering was measured using the Apoptotic DNA-Ladder kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. For flow cytometry analysis, cells were fixed in 70% ethanol and resuspended in PBS containing propidium iodide (1 mg/ml) and RNase (40 μg/ml). Cell cycle progression and apoptosis were analyzed in an Epics XL flow cytometer (Coulter Corp, Hialeah, FL). For each treatment 7,500 events were recorded. [3H]PDBu binding to PKC isozymes was measured using the polyethylene glycol precipitation assay. A detailed description of the methodology is presented in Ref. 30Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar. To measure competition of [3H]PDBu binding by different analogs, we used a fixed concentration of [3H]PDBu (3 nm) and increasing concentrations (in triplicate) of the competing nonradioactive ligand. ID50 values were determined from the competition curve, and the Ki for the competing ligand was calculated from the ID50 by using the relationship Ki = ID50/(1 + L/Kd), whereKd is the dissociation constant for [3H]PDBu and L is the concentration of free [3H]PDBu at the ID50. PKCα and PKCδ used in these assays were generated by baculovirus infection of Sf9 insect cells and subsequent purification, as described previously (30Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). PKC activity was assayed by measuring the incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into a specific PKC substrate (α-pseudosubstrate peptide), as described previously (30Kazanietz M.G. Areces L.B. Bahador A. Mischak H. Goodnight J. Mushinski J.F. Blumberg P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar), using 100 μg/ml phospholipid vesicles (20% phosphatidylserine, 80% phosphatidylcholine) prepared by sonication. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min. Kinase activity was linear with time over this incubation period. Protein determinations were made with the Micro BCA Protein Assay from Pierce, using bovine serum albumin as a standard. DAGs possess substantially lower potency for binding to PKCs and reduced metabolic stability compared with the corresponding phorbol ester analogs. An approach that was used to successfully generate potent DAG analogs involved constraining the glycerol backbone into a five-member ring (DAG-lactone). With the combined use of pharmacophore- and receptor-guided approaches facilitated by the crystal structure of the PKCδ C1b domain, it was possible to rationally design structurally simple DAG-lactone ligands that displayed binding affinities for PKCα in the low nanomolar range (19Teng K.

However, very limited information on the biological activity of these DAG-lactones is available other than their in vitro binding affinity for PKCα as a receptor. A group of 29 DAG-lactones that exhibited high binding affinities for PKCα (in the low nanomolar range) were selected to generate a structurally diverse set of compounds displaying various combinations of R1 and R2 groups (general structure, Fig.1). Their affinities for PKCα expressed in term of Ki values covered a wide range: 2–6 nm (10 compounds), 6–9 nm (3 compounds), 9–13 nm (6 compounds), 12–20 nm (4 compounds), 20–40 nm (2 compounds), and ≫ 40 nm (4 compounds). The lipophilicity range (log P) spanned between 3.5 and 6.5. Because phorbol esters exhibit pro-apoptotic activity in LNCaP prostate cancer cells, we decided to evaluate these 29 compounds for their apoptotic effect in these cells. From this group, four compounds were selected for their unique structure-activity relationship in terms of their apoptotic inducing potency. The structures of these compounds are shown together with the code names used in the text (Fig. 1). The complete set of 29 compounds, as well as the description of their syntheses and characterization, including the selected compounds for this work, will be described elsewhere. 2J. Lee, K.-C. Han, J.-H. Kang, N. E. Lewin, S. Yan, S. Benzaria, M. C. Nicklaus, P. M. Blumberg, and V. E. Marquez, submitted for publication. LNCaP cells were treated with different DAG-lactones at a single concentration (10 μm) for 1 h, and apoptosis was assessed 24 h later by counting the number of apoptotic cells after DAPI staining. After such time, a maximum apoptotic response is normally observed following PKC activation (17Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamaño J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7574-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Both HK434 and HK654 induced ∼30% of apoptosis, which equals the maximum response observed with PMA under the experimental conditions used in our studies. On the other hand, DAG-lactones HK204 and HK602 showed only a modest response, as was also observed with 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG), a DAG that is commonly used to activate PKC in cellular models (Fig. 2A). A representative field with apoptotic cells under the fluorescent microscope is shown in Fig. 2B. As shown in the figure, a large number of cells with morphological changes distinctive of apoptosis, including nuclear fragmentation and cell shrinkage, were observed after treatment with PMA or DAG-lactones. HK434, HK654, and PMA were able to induce a characteristic pattern of DNA fragmentation, visualized as DNA laddering in agarose gels (Fig. 2C). A concentration-dependence analysis showed that HK434 and HK654 were more potent than OAG or PDBu, a phorbol ester commonly used to activate PKC. As expected, the inactive phorbol ester 4α-PMA was totally ineffective in inducing apoptosis in LNCaP cells. The presence of apoptotic cells after treatment with DAG-lactones was also detected by flow cytometry analysis (see Fig. 4).Figure 4Effect of the PKC inhibitor GF 109203X.LNCaP cells were treated with vehicle, 100 nm PMA, 10 μm HK654, or 10 μm HK434, either in the absence or presence of 5 μm GF 109203X, which was present 1 h before and during the treatment with DAG-lactones or PMA.Panel A, cells were collected 24 h after treatment and stained with DAPI.

We treated LNCaP cells with the pan-caspase peptide z-VAD (50 μm) and evaluated the apoptotic effect of the DAG-lactone HK654 and PMA. As shown in Fig. 3A, z-VAD markedly reduced the number of apoptotic cells after HK654 or PMA treatment. The role of Bcl-2 as a key anti-apoptotic molecule is well established in many cell types, including prostate cancer cells (31Green D.R. Reed J.C.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5251-5258Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of DAG-lactones in LNCaP cells transfected with a mammalian expression vector that encodes for Bcl-2. These cells (LNCaP-Neo/Bcl-2) expressed high levels of Bcl-2 compared with vector-transfected cells (LNCaP-Neo) (24Raffo A.J. Perlman H. Chen M.-W. Day M.L. Streitman J.S. Buttyan R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4438-4445PubMed Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing Bcl-2 showed a marked resistance to apoptosis when stimulated with either HK654 or PMA. The apoptotic responses to PMA and HK654 in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells are only 41 and 32%, respectively, of those observed in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). To confirm that the apoptotic effect of DAG-lactones in LNCaP cells is mediated by activation of PKC, we assessed the effect of these compounds in the presence of PKC inhibitors. This is important because phorbol esters and DAG have other targets in addition to PKC isozymes (2Kazanietz M.G. Caloca M.J. Eroles P. Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Reilly M. Wang H.B. Biochem.

A critical function in the presynaptic compartment attributed to the brain-specific dynamin isoform, dynamin-1, is in synaptic vesicle recycling. We report that dynamin-2 specifically interacts with members of the Shank/ProSAP family of postsynaptic density scaffolding proteins and present evidence that dynamin-2 is specifically associated with the postsynaptic density.

Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), suggesting that the protein may directly function in membrane scission. Alternatively, dynamin has also been postulated to act as a GTPase switch by recruiting other endocytic factors to the neck and then activating them to sever the coated vesicle (12Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Dynamin contains an amino-terminal GTPase domain, followed by a central coiled-coil assembly domain (13Okamoto P.M. Tripet B. Litowski J. Hodges R.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10277-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), a pleckstrin homology domain, which binds to phosphoinositides and the βγ subunits of heterotrimeric GTPases (14Lin H.C.

At the extreme carboxyl terminus is a basic, proline-rich domain to which a number of Src homology 3 (SH3)1 domain-containing proteins, acidic phospholipids, and microtubules have been shown to bind (18Herskovits J.S.

Considerable insight into dynamin function at the synapse has come from genetic and morphological studies on the temperature-sensitive mutants of shibire, the dynamin ortholog in Drosophila (21Chen M.S. Obar R.A. Schroeder C.C. Austin T.W. Poodry C.A. Wadsworth S.C. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1991; 351: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 22van der Bliek A.M. Meyerowitz E.M. Nature. 1991; 351: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Single point mutations in the GTPase domain ofshibire cause paralysis at elevated temperatures, and ultrastructural analysis of nerve terminals under these conditions has revealed a depletion of synaptic vesicles, along with an accumulation of collared pits (23Koenig J.H. Saito K. Ikeda K. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1517-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 24Koenig J.H. Ikeda K. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3844-3860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, three closely related dynamin genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Dynamin-1 is almost exclusively expressed in neurons (25Nakata T. Iwamoto A. Noda Y. Takemura R. Yoshikura H. Hirokawa N. Neuron. 1991; 7: 461-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Dynamin-2 is found in the brain but is also widely expressed among other tissues (26Cook T.A. Urrutia R. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 27Sablin E.P. Kull F.J. Cooke R. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4547-4554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dynamin-3 was initially identified in testis (29Nakata T. Takemura R. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but is also found in brain, lung, and heart (30Cao H. Garcia F. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2595-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Differences in the subcellular distribution of the dynamin gene products and their alternative splice forms have been reported (30Cao H. Garcia F. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2595-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Because of its restriction to neurons, dynamin-1 has been assumed to be the synaptic isoform. The function of dynamin-2 is less well understood, and a role in neurons has not been identified. Overexpression of a dominant inhibitory mutant form of dynamin-2 in cultured hippocampal neurons was recently reported to inhibit glutamate-induced down-regulation of α-amino-3-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (31Carroll R.C. Beattie E.C. Xia H., C, L.S. Altschuler Y. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14112-14117Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). This result is of considerable current interest in view of evidence that up- and down-regulation of glutamate receptors plays a role in long term potentiation and depression (32Carroll R.C. Lissin D.V. von Zastrow M. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 33Luscher C. Xia H. Beattie E.C. Carroll R.C. von Zastrow M. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Neuron. 1999; 24: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Whether dynamin-2, in particular, functions postsynaptically is uncertain from these experiments, because of the interchangeability of dynamin isoforms when overexpressed (Ref. 13Okamoto P.M. Tripet B. Litowski J. Hodges R.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10277-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar; also see “Results”). To learn more about the specific functions of dynamin-2, we have used the yeast two-hybrid assay to identify dynamin-2-specific interacting proteins. We report here that dynamin-2 interacts with at least two members of the Shank/ProSAP family, which have recently been described as components of the postsynaptic density (PSD) (34Boeckers T.M. Winter C. Smalla K.H. Kreutz M.R. Bockmann J. Seidenbecher C. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 35Naisbitt S.

Neuron. 1999; 23: 569-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar) Dynamin-2 exhibits a synaptic distribution in cultured hippocampal neurons and is specifically enriched relative to dynamin-1 in the postsynaptic density. Our findings indicate a close association between the endocytic machinery and the PSD and provide new insight into the dynamics of this structure. The entire dynamin-2bb cDNA was subcloned into the JK202 bait vector and used to screen an adult human brain cDNA library (Invitrogen, Inc.) for interactors in a LexA-based yeast two-hybrid assay utilizing the yeast strain, EGY191 (36Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Potential positives, as deemed by their ability to both grow in the absence of leucine and activate β-galactosidase expression, were further analyzed using BLAST and SMART searches. To qualitatively evaluate the β-galactosidase activities, highly sensitive filter assays were carried out as described in the Matchmaker LexA two-hybrid system user manual (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.). For the domain mapping studies and interaction specificity analyses, carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of dynamin-2 in JK202 were generated using PCR. The dynamin-1 two-hybrid bait construct in JK202 has been described previously (13Okamoto P.M. Tripet B. Litowski J. Hodges R.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10277-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the light intermediate chain-2 (LIC2) bait construct was generously provided by Dr. Jorge Garces. The Shank1 cDNA was cloned from a rat brain cDNA library using reverse transcriptase-PCR with gene specific primers and LATaq polymerase (Takara Shuzo Ltd.). The library was generated using the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc.) and kindly provided by Dr. Atsushi Mikami. The various PCR fragments were initially cloned into pCR2.1 using the TOPO-TA cloning system (Invitrogen, Inc.) and subsequently assembled into a full-length cDNA in the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen, Inc.). Three consecutive Myc tags, which were required for the detection of the epitope in overexpressed cells, were added to the amino terminus of Shank1 by PCR. All PCR-generated constructs were sequenced for accuracy. A Shank1 antibody was raised in rabbits against a His-tagged fusion protein consisting of the Shank1 region of a.a. 1792–2001. Carboxyl-terminal anti-dynamin-1 and -2 isoform-specific antibodies have been described previously (37Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) as have a dynamin-2-specific antibody prepared against an internal sequence (Oncogene; Ref. 38Henley J.R. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and antibodies against cortactin-binding protein, a generous gift from Dr. Tom Parsons (39Du Y. Weed S.A. Xiong W. Marshall T.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5838-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and the Myc epitope (40Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Molec.

The other antibodies used in this study and their sources are anti-cortactin (p80/85 Src60 substrate, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-synaptophysin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), anti-PSD95 (Calbiochem), anti-N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor 1 (PharMingen), anti-calmodulin kinase II (Calbiochem), and anti-HA (Covance). All of the secondary antibodies used were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch, Inc. For the immunoprecipitation assays in COS-7 cells, either dynamin-1 or -2 was co-transfected with Myc-tagged Shank2 or Shank1 using LipofectAMINE as suggested by the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Inc.), and the lysates were prepared in cold RIPA buffer as described previously (13Okamoto P.M. Tripet B. Litowski J. Hodges R.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10277-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation assays were carried out with either the dynamin-1 or -2 isoform-specific antibody on protein A beads for 4 h at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation, after which the beads were extensively washed with cold RIPA buffer. The samples were then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5%), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and blotted with Myc or the dynamin isoform-specific antibodies. For the immunoprecipitation assays from rat brain tissue, the cytosolic extract was prepared as described previously (37Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the assays were carried out in the same manner as described for COS-7 cells (see above). The GST pull-down assays were performed essentially as described (37Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The bacterially expressed and purified recombinant GST fusion protein of a Shank2 fragment (a.a. 888–1180) that corresponds to the dynamin-2 binding region in Shank1 or the GST protein alone was immobilized on Sepharose 4B-glutathione beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet 40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were then washed three times with binding buffer. Baculovirus expressed and purified recombinant full-length HA-tagged dynamin-2 was added, and binding was allowed to occur for an additional 1 h at room temperature with end-over-end rotation, after which the beads were washed four times with cold binding buffer. Bound HA-tagged dynamin-2 was eluted twice with elution buffer (50 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8). The eluants were combined, resolved in 9% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, and processed for Western analysis. HA-dynamin-2 was assayed by immunoblotting with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Purification of the HA-tagged dynamin-2 protein was as reported previously (42Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). For the blot overlay assays, cytosolic extracts of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with either Myc-tagged Shank1 or Myc-tagged dynein IC2C were prepared 48 h post-transfection in ice-cold RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, E-64, 16 μg/ml benzamidine, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride). The extracts were spun 20 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C, after which the overexpressed Myc-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Myc polyclonal antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by an incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed once with 1m NaCl and 1% Nonidet P-40, twice with RIPA and 1m urea, and once with RIPA. The proteins were resolved on a 7.5% acrylamide/SDS gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, cut into strips, and allowed to renature in renaturation buffer (TBST with 5% nonfat dry milk) at 4 °C for 16 h. The strips were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in overlay binding buffer (TBST, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MgSO4) in the presence or absence of 0.5 μm purified, recombinant HA-tagged dynamin-2 followed by two washes in wash buffer (TBST, 2 mm MgSO4) and then cross-linked to the membrane with 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After extensively washing the strips in wash buffer, they were then incubated for an hour with anti-HA monoclonal antibody in the overlay binding buffer. Enhanced chemiluminescence was used to process all of the above immunoblotting experiments. Rat hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from 18–19-day-old rat embryos as previously described (43Goslin G.B.A.K. Rat Hippocampal Neurons in Low-density Culture: Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991: 339-370Google Scholar) and processed for immunofluorescence as essentially reported earlier (44Wu L. Wells D. Tay J. Mendis D. Abbott M.A. Barnitt A. Quinlan E. Heynen A. Fallon J.R. Richter J.D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1129-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Briefly, after 19–21 days in culture, the neurons were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and then extracted with 0.05% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. Incubation in anti-dynamin-2, anti-dynamin-1, or anti-synaptophysin primary antibody was overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation in either Cy3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated species-specific secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Immunofluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. For the co-clustering experiments, COS7 cells were plated on coverslips that had been pretreated with poly-l-lysine and transiently transfected with HA-tagged dynamin-2, PSD95, Myc-tagged Shank1a, and/or GFP-tagged GKAP1a using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen, Inc.). The cDNAs for PSD95 and GKAP1a were generously provided by Dr. Craig Garner (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL). All of the constructs were made in pcDNA 3.1+ (Invitrogen, Inc.) with the exception of GFP-GKAP1a, which was subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH, Inc.). After 24 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and then extracted with ice-cold methanol for 5 min at −20 °C. HA, Myc, and PSD primary antibodies were applied to the cells for 1 h at 37 °C, after which they were briefly washed and then incubated with Cy3-, Cy5-, or Alexa Green-conjugated, species-specific secondary antibodies for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. All of the antibodies were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin. The images were gathered and processed with a Leica DMIRBE immunofluorescent microscope interfaced to a CCD camera using the Metamorph software. Rat brain homogenate and synaptosomal and postsynaptic density fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation following previously published protocol (45Abbott M.A. Wells D.G. Fallon J.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) with the exception that 25 unstripped frozen whole rat brains (Pel-Freeze) were used. Twenty micrograms of each fraction was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and blotted for various synaptic proteins at the following dilutions: anti-synaptophysin, 1:200; anti-dynamin-2, 1:1000; anti-dynamin-1b, 1:6000; anti-dynamin-1a, 1:5000; anti-Shank1, 1:2000; anti-PSD95, 1:200; anti-calmodulin kinase II, 1:200; and anti-NMDAR1, 1:1000. All blots were processed for imaging using enhanced chemiluminescence. To identify proteins that interact with dynamin-2, we used a full-length dynamin-2 construct as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human brain cDNA library. Of ∼3 × 107 transformants that were screened, 24 grew on Leu− medium and activated β-galactosidase. Two of the prey sequences coded for a 188-a.a. fragment of Shank1 (also known as ProSAP2 and synamon), a member of the recently discovered Shank/ProSAP PDZ domain-containing protein family that has been reported to act as scaffolding components of the PSD (35Naisbitt S.

Shank1 was initially identified on the basis of its interaction with GKAP/SAPAP/DAP1 (34Boeckers T.M. Winter C. Smalla K.H. Kreutz M.R. Bockmann J. Seidenbecher C. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D.

Besides its PDZ domain, Shank1 also contains an ankyrin repeat region, an SH3 domain, a polyhistidine segment, and a sterile α motif domain (Fig.1 a). Our 188-a.a. fragment mapped to a proline-rich region (a.a. 1603–1790) located between the latter two domains (Fig. 1,a and b). We also tested for an interaction between dynamin-2 and Shank2.

Weed S.A. Xiong W. Marshall T.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5838-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), has been shown to be present in PSDs, neuronal growth cones, and other actin-containing cytoskeletal structures (39Du Y. Weed S.A. Xiong W. Marshall T.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5838-5851Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and exhibits 32% identity (53% similarity) to Shank1 within the dynamin-2 binding region we identified. As shown in Fig. 1 b, clear evidence for an interaction with full-length Shank2 was observed. We also tested for dynamin isoform specificity in a directed two-hybrid assay. No interaction could be detected with dynamin-1 as bait (Fig.1 b). Taken together, these results reveal the identification of a novel class of isoform-specific dynamin-binding partners. Because the dynamin-1 and -2 sequences differ most prominently within the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich domain, we reasoned that the binding site for the Shank/ProSAP proteins might lie within this region. To test this possibility, we used carboxyl-terminal dynamin-2 deletion mutants in a directed two-hybrid assay. Binding of both Shank1 and Shank2 persisted in constructs lacking up to 31 a.a. from the carboxyl terminus (Dyn-2 C837–C868; Fig. 1 c). Removal of an additional 10 amino acids (Dyn-2 C824), however, completely abolished the interaction (Fig. 1 c). At least two Shank family members (Shank2/CortBP1 and Shank3a) have been found to interact with the actin-binding protein, cortactin, which has recently also been reported to interact with dynamin-2 (35Naisbitt S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We found that cortactin interacts with the carboxyl-terminal portion of dynamin-2 in our two-hybrid assay, consistent with previous results (52McNiven M.A. Kim L. Krueger E.W. Orth J.D. Cao H. Wong T.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, binding was completely abolished in three dynamin-2 constructs that still exhibited a strong interaction with Shank1 and Shank 2 (Dyn-2 C837–C844; Fig. 1 c). Using the yeast two-hybrid assay, we also defined the region within the original Shank1 prey fragment responsible for dynamin-2 binding. Binding was abolished upon deletion of the amino-terminal 29 a.a. from the Shank1 188-a.a. prey fragment (Fig. 1 c). This region is among the more highly conserved parts of the prey fragment (72% identity; 86% similar; Fig. 1 c), consistent with a conserved functional role. To test further for an association between dynamin-2 and members of the Shank/ProSAP family, we overexpressed either Myc-tagged dynamin-1 or dynamin-2 with Shank2 in COS-7 cells. Full-length untagged Shank2 co-immunoprecipitated with either Myc-dynamin-1 or -2 (Fig.2 a). This result supports the two-hybrid data, but the co-immunoprecipitation of both dynamin isoforms with Shank2 appears to contradict the dynamin isoform specificity revealed by the two-hybrid analysis. However, we believe that co-immunoprecipitation of overexpressed dynamin-1 with Shank2 occurs through an interaction between dynamin-1 and dynamin-2, which is the predominant isoform expressed in COS7 and other non-neuronal cultured cell lines (data not shown). Direct evidence for the free interaction between dynamin isoforms can be observed in Fig.2 c (see below) and in our previous results (13Okamoto P.M. Tripet B. Litowski J. Hodges R.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10277-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and we note that dynamin-2 co-immunoprecipitates Shank2 more efficiently than does dynamin-1. Both dynamin isoforms co-immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged Shank1 (Fig. 2 b), and, again, overexpressed dynamin-2 performed better than dynamin-1. We also carried out co-immunoprecipitation assays using rat brain cytosol. Only Shank2 could be examined by this assay because of the insolubility of Shank1. Clear co-immunoprecipitation of Shank2 with dynamin was observed (Fig. 2 c). Shank2 again co-immunoprecipitated with both dynamin-1 and -2, in this case using the carboxyl-terminal anti-dynamin antibodies, but we also note the clear ability of the two endogenous dynamin isoforms to co-immunoprecipitate with either antibody. To test whether cortactin may play an intermediary role in the dynamin-2 and Shank/ProSAP interaction, dynamin-2 was overexpressed in wild-type COS-7 cells, and the immunoprecipitate was tested for endogenous cortactin. As shown in Fig. 2 d, no cortactin was detected in these immunoprecipitates, although a significant amount of cortactin was present in these cells (lysate lanes in Fig.2 d). These results argued further that the interaction between dynamin-2 and Shank2 or Shank1 did not involve cortactin, although other intervening proteins could not be ruled out. To ascertain whether the interaction between dynamin-2 and the Shank family is, indeed, direct, a GST fusion protein containing the region of Shank2 corresponding to the initially identified prey fragment was tested for its ability to bind purified dynamin-2. Clear binding by the GST-Shank2 fusion protein, but not by GST alone, was observed (Fig.3 a). Blot overlays using purified dynamin-2 also revealed specific binding to electrophoretically fractionated Shank1 (Fig. 3 b). Together our data indicate that dynamin-2 specifically associates with a family of known synaptic proteins. However, whether dynamin-2 is present in neurons and what its subcellular distribution may be are unknown. Immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured hippocampal neurons revealed punctate staining along dendrites with both the dynamin-2 and dynamin-1b carboxyl-terminal isoform-specific antibodies (Fig. 4). The dynamin-2 staining exhibited clear co-localization with the synaptic marker synaptophysin (Fig. 4). To examine whether dynamin-2 is present in PSDs, we tested a series of markers for biochemical co-fractionation with these structures. Both dynamin-1 and -2 isoforms were found in the synaptosomal fraction. However, dynamin-2 was clearly found in the purified PSD fraction, whereas dynamin-1 was present at low to undetectable"

The two proteins, Pfup41 and Pfup46, have similar sequences to the p48 and p58 subunits, respectively, of the eukaryotic DNA polymerase α-primase complex. Unlike previously reported primases, the Pfup41 preferentially utilizes deoxyribonucleotides for its de novo synthesis, and moreover, it synthesizes up to several kilobases in length in a template-dependent manner (Bocquier, A., Liu, L., Cann, I., Komori, K., Kohda, D., and Ishino, Y. (2001) Curr. Biol.11, 452–456). The p41-p46 complex showed higher DNA binding activity than the catalytic p41 subunit alone. In addition, the amount of DNA synthesized by the p41-p46 complex was much more abundant and shorter in length than that by Pfup41 alone. The activity for RNA primer synthesis, which was not detected with Pfup41, was observed from the reaction using the p41-p46 complex in vitro. The in vitro replication of M13 single-stranded DNA by the P. furiosus proteins was stimulated by ATP. Observation of the labeled primers by using [γ-32P]ATP in the substrates suggests ATP as the preferable initiating nucleotide for the p41-p46 complex. These results show that the primer synthesis activity of Pfup41 is regulated by Pfup46, and the p41-p46 complex may function as the primase in the DNA replication machinery of P. furiosus, in a similar fashion to the eukaryotic polymerase α-primase complex.

In both the bacterial and eukaryotic DNA replication processes, DNA polymerases are incapable of de novo DNA synthesis, and it is well known that DNA primase works for the de novo synthesis of the short RNA/DNA oligonucleotide on the template DNAs for both the leading and lagging strands. The short oligonucleotide, called the primer, is then extended by DNA polymerases to synthesize the long DNA strand (reviewed in Refs. 1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar and 2Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the primase activity is derived from the DnaG protein, and it synthesizes a short RNA primer. The DnaG protein interacts with the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, and this interaction limits the size of the nascent primers to the range of 9–14 nucleotides (3Zechner E.L. Wu C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4054-4063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the eukaryotic primase is known as the DNA polymerase α-primase complex (pol α-pri),1 which is composed of four subunits, p180, p70, p58, and p48 (reviewed in Refs. 4Wang T.S.-F. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 461-493Google Scholarand 5Arezi B. Kuchta D. Trends Biochem. 2000; 25: 572-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Among these subunits, the primase activity requires the p48 and p58 subunits, and especially, p48 is known to be the primase catalytic subunit. These two subunits assemble together with the DNA polymerase subunit, p180, and the p70 subunit, whose function is unknown. The current understanding of the molecular mechanism of primer synthesis is as follows: at the replication origin (for the leading strand synthesis) or at the preferred sites (for the lagging strand synthesis), the p48 subunit synthesizes an RNA primer that is typically 8–12 nucleotides long. Then, the pol α subunit elongates the RNA primer to about a 30-mer using dNTPs as substrates to generate the DNA primer, which can be extended by the replicative DNA polymerases (pol δ and pol ε). Archaea, the third domain of life (6Woese C.R. Kandler O. Wheelis M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4576-4579Crossref PubMed Scopus (4515) Google Scholar), is now recognized as biologically and evolutionarily interesting to study. However, the current knowledge of the DNA replication mechanism in Archaea is still rudimentary. Several genes encoding eukaryotic-like DNA replication proteins have been found in archaeal genomes, and numerous biochemical studies have been reported (reviewed in Refs. 7Edgell D.R. Doolittle W.F. Cell. 1997; 89: 995-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 8Ishino Y. Cann I.K.O. Genes Genet.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3389-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). These results have led to the proposal that the mechanism of archaeal DNA replication is basically similar to that of Eukarya. Biochemical characterizations of the individual protein factors as well as genetic analyses of the corresponding genes involved in the initiation and elongation processes are necessary to understand the global mechanism of molecular recognition in archaeal DNA replication. To date, several proteins involved in the elongation step, including DNA polymerases, PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), RFC (replication factor C), and RPA (replication protein A) have been characterized in vitro, including the homologs from Pyrococcus furiosus(11Uemori T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25654-25660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, there are no reports about the initiation of archaeal DNA replication or its priming mechanism. In the archaeal genomes, there is one open reading frame (ORF) that has some sequence similarity to the eukaryotic DNA primase subunit p48 (20Kirk B.W. Kuchta R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7727-7736Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The corresponding genes have been cloned from Methanococcus jannaschii and P. furiosus, and the gene products, Mjpri (21Desogus G. Onesti S. Brick P. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4444-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and Pfup41 (22Bocquier A.A. Liu L. Cann I.K.O. Komori K. Kohda D. Ishino Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), respectively, have been characterized. One remarkable property of Pfup41 is that it preferentially uses deoxyribonucleotides as a substrate and hasde novo activity to synthesize long DNA strands in vitro (22Bocquier A.A. Liu L. Cann I.K.O. Komori K. Kohda D. Ishino Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The next step of this archaeal primase study is to investigate whether the catalytic primase proteins form a complex with other proteins in the replication machinery, like those of the other two biological domains. There is no ORF with an obvious similarity to the eukaryotic p58 subunit in the archaeal genomes. However, based on our knowledge that in P. furiosus, genes encoding functionary related proteins are often arranged in tandem on the genomic DNA. Therefore, we carefully compared sequences of the ORFs neighboring to Pfup41 with that of eukaryotic p58 and found some similarity in one ORF overlapped with that for Pfup41. These two genes seemed likely to compose an operon. In this study, we cloned the gene for the p58-like protein fromP. furiosus, expressed it in E. coli, and characterized the gene product, named Pfup46. We demonstrated that the Pfup46 protein modulates the activities of Pfup41 for the primase-polymerase. From the biochemical properties of the p41-p46 complex, we propose an archaeal replication model, in which the p41-p46 complex works as the primase-polymerase, like the eukaryotic pol α-pri complex. The two genes were amplified directly from P. furiosus genomic DNA, prepared as described earlier (11Uemori T. Ishino Y. Toh H. Asada K. Kato I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), by polymerase chain reaction using PfuDNA polymerase (Stratagene) to maintain the accuracy of amplification. The nucleotide sequences of the genes were confirmed after they were cloned into the TA-cloning vector (Novagen). Preparation of the pPFPR41 plasmid and production of the Pfup41 protein in E. coli were as described previously (22Bocquier A.A. Liu L. Cann I.K.O. Komori K. Kohda D. Ishino Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Due to the difficulty in producing thePfup41 protein in a high yield, the protein was produced as a hexa-histidine-tagged protein at the N terminus. For the gene encoding the Pfup46 protein, two primers were used, p46-F (5′-CACGACCATGGTAGACCCATTTAGTGAG-3′) and p46-R (5-CACGGTCGACTCATTACTGTAGAATTCGCT3′), with NcoI and SalI restriction sites (underlined), respectively. The gene was inserted into the corresponding site of pET21d (Novagen) to obtain the expression plasmid, pPFPR46. The Pfup41 and Pfup46 proteins were overproduced as follows: E. coli BL21-codonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Novagen) cells harboring pPFPR41 or pPFPR46 were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium in the presence of ampicillin and chloramphenicol. When the culture reached an A600 of 0.4, the expression of the target genes was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mm. After cultivation for a further 5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, with yields of 3.8 and 4.0 g (wet weight), respectively, for Pfup41 and Pfup46. ThePfup41 protein was purified from E. coli/pPFPR41 cells. The cell lysate was prepared by sonication in 70 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.3 m NaCl) containing 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation for 20 min at 30,000 × g, the supernatant was incubated at 80 °C for 15 min to remove most of the E. coli proteins, and then the supernatant was loaded onto a chelating column charged with Co2+ ions (5 ml, TALON™,CLONTECH), connected on an FPLC apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was extensively washed with buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole, and the bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole. The protein fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.3 m NaCl), and subjected to cation-exchange chromatography (HiTrap SP, 1 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on an AKTA system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The chromatography was developed with a 20-ml linear gradient of 0.3–0.8m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The active fractions, which eluted at a salt concentration of 0.5–0.7 m NaCl, were pooled, dialyzed against buffer C (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and stored at 4 °C. The concentration of purified Pfup41 was determined by using a molar extinction coefficient ε of 47,770m−1 cm−1, which was calculated from the amino acid sequence with the ExPASy-ProParam Tool program. ThePfup46 was purified from E. coli/pPFPR46 cells. The cell lysate was prepared and heat-treated as described above. The supernatant after centrifugation was mixed with polyethyleneimine (Sigma) and NaCl to 0.2% (w/v) and 0.3 m, respectively, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min on ice to precipitate the DNA. The proteins were then precipitated with ammonium sulfate (80% saturation). The precipitate was resuspended in and dialyzed against buffer A. The dialysate was diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final NaCl concentration of 0.1 m and was applied immediately to an anion exchange column (HiTrap Q, 5 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The chromatography was developed with a 50-ml linear gradient of 0.1–1.0 m NaCl at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The Pfup46 protein, which eluted at a salt concentration of 0.1 to 0.25 m, was collected and applied to a HiTrap Heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The chromatography was developed with a 20-ml linear 0.05–0.8m NaCl gradient, and the Pfup46 protein was eluted at a salt concentration of 0.3–0.5 m NaCl. The concentration of Pfup46 protein was determined by using a molar extinction coefficient ε of 43,950 m−1cm−1. For the preparation of the p41-p46 complex, the purified Pfup41 was combined with an excess amount of purified Pfup46 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and was subjected to cation-exchange chromatography (HiTrap SP) as described for the Pfup41 purification. The excess, freePfup46 was found in the flowthrough fraction, and the p41-p46 complex was eluted at a salt concentration of 0.5–0.7m NaCl. Three synthetic oligonucleotides, described earlier (18Cann I.K.O. Ishino S. Yuasa M. Daiyasu H. Toh H. Ishino Y. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2614-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), were used as the substrates. The 49-mer deoxyribonucleotide was labeled at the 5′ terminus using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Shuzo) and was used as the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A primed DNA (priDNA) and a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were prepared by annealing the labeled 49-mer DNA to its unlabeled complementary 17-mer and 49-mer, respectively, with an equal molar ratio. The DNA substrate (50 nm) was incubated for 5 min at 55 °C with various amounts (50–750 nm) of proteins in a total volume of 10 μl, in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The protein/DNA mixtures were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel and were separated by electrophoresis in 0.1 × TAE buffer (4 mm Tris acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.4) at 50 V for 1.5 h at room temperature. The radiolabeled DNA was visualized by autoradiography. The reaction mixture (20 μl), containing primase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), 1 μg M13 mp18 single-stranded DNA (23Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11465) Google Scholar), 100 μm each of dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP, and 10 μm dATP containing [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), was incubated with Pfup41 or p41-p46 (0.35 μm) at 70 °C for 20 min. The reaction products were analyzed by 1% alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) in 50 mm sodium hydroxide and 1 mm EDTA, followed by autoradiography. A laser-excited image analyzer (BAS-5000; Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) was used to quantify the synthesized strands. DNA synthesis reaction was carried out in an assay mixture (20 μl) containing primase assay buffer, 100 μmeach of dATP, dGTP, and TTP, 10 μm dCTP containing [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.5 μg of M13mp18 single-stranded DNA, and 0.14 μm p41-p46 complex, in addition to 2.5 units of P. furiosus pol I (pol BI) (14Komori K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25654-25660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) at 70 °C for 20 min except for any concrete descriptions. The products were analyzed by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the presence of 8 m urea. To analyze the lengths of DNA fragments, the reaction mixtures were fractionated by 1% alkaline AGE, followed by autoradiography. To compare the product amounts in the presence of different NTP concentrations, the band of the full-length product from each reaction on the autoradiogram was quantified as described above. As a control, a synthetic DNA 30 nucleotides long was annealed to M13 DNA and was used as the template-primer for the DNA synthesis reaction by P. furiosus proteins except p41-p46 as described earlier (17Cann I.K.O. Ishino S. Hayashi I. Komori K. Toh H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6591-6599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,18Cann I.K.O. Ishino S. Yuasa M. Daiyasu H. Toh H. Ishino Y. J.

RNA primer synthesis was carried out at 55 °C for 20 min in an assay (20 μl) containing primase assay buffer, 100 μm concentration each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 10 μm UTP containing [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.5 μg of M13 mp18 single-stranded DNA, and 0.14 μm p41-p46. For the primer extension reactions, 100 μm concentration each dNTP and 2.5 units of pol I (pol BI) or pol II (pol D) were mixed together with the materials for RNA primer synthesis, and the reactions were carried out at 70 °C for 20 min. The reaction products were analyzed as described above. For the competition of dNTPs and NTPs in the primer synthesis reaction, increasing concentrations of dNTPs were added to the reaction for RNA primer synthesis. The reaction products were analyzed by PAGE on a 10% gel containing 8 murea, followed by autoradiography. Each product signal was quantified as described above. The concentration ratios of the substrates (dNTPs/NTPs) were no NTPs, 1/1000, 1/100, 1/10, 1/1, and no dNTP. In reverse, increasing concentrations (1, 10, and 100 μm) of ATP or NTPs were added to the reaction for DNA primer synthesis, containing 1 μm concentration of each dNTP ([32P]dCTP) at 55 °C 30 min. To see the effect of high concentrations of NTPs, dNTP concentration was lowered to 1 μm in this experiment. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against homogeneous Pfup41 andPfup46, respectively. The antibodies for pol I (pol BI) were as described previously (15Cann I.K.O. Komori K. Toh H. Kanai S. Ishino Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14250-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments were done as follows at room temperature: 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were dispensed into each of four Eppendorf tubes, and the resin was washed three times with PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). The protein A-Sepharose in each tube was then mixed with one of the above antisera (10 μl) and incubated for 1 h on a rotary shaker. Each mixture was washed twice with PBS and once with buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The contents of each tube were mixed with 400 μl of P. furiosus cell extract (from 40 μg of cells) and were incubated for 30 min on a rotary shaker. Precipitates were washed three times with buffer D, and the immunoprecipitated products were eluted by boiling them in 30 μl of 1 × loading buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% 2- mercaptoethanol, 0.04% bromphenol blue, 1% SDS), followed by Western blot analysis. The blots were analyzed with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Pierce), using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch). In the P. furiosus genome, there is one ORF with an amino acid sequence similar to that of the p48 subunit of the eukaryotic pol α-pri complex. We characterized the protein, named Pfup41, as a primase in vitro (22Bocquier A.A. Liu L. Cann I.K.O. Komori K. Kohda D. Ishino Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One remarkable characteristic is that this enzyme has de novoactivity to synthesize long DNA strands. To further characterize the function of the primase in P. furiosus cells, we sought to identify additional primase subunits corresponding to those of Eukarya. We found that an ORF overlapping that of Pfup41 has some sequence similarity to that of the p58 subunit of the Pol α-pri complex (Fig. 1). It has been shown that there is some remarkable sequence similarity between the eukaryotic p58 subunit and the 8-kDa domain of DNA pol β (20Kirk B.W. Kuchta R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7727-7736Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The conserved residues between p58 and pol β are located in box c in Fig. 1 A. These residues are not well aligned when p58 proteins are compared with archaeal proteins. However, there are some localized similarities between p58 proteins and archaeal proteins across the regions, and therefore, we cloned the corresponding gene, expressed it in E. coli, and purified the gene product, named Pfup46. In contrast to the production ofPfup41, which was produced in a histidine-tagged form because of the low production efficiency, Pfup46 was efficiently produced in E. coli, and it was purified to high homogeneity without the need for a tag (Fig.2, A and B). From 1 liter of each culture, 1.0 and 6.5 mg of His-Pfup41 andPfup46 were purified, respectively.Figure 2Purification of Pfup41 (A), Pfup46 (B), and the p41-p46 complex (C). SDS-PAGE (10%) analysis of the recombinant p41 and p46 proteins from the different stages of the purification. In A and B, lanes:1, supernatant after sonication; 2, supernatant after heat treatment (80 °C, 15 min); 3, metal affinity fraction in A or HiTrap Q fraction in B; 4, HiTrap SP fraction in A or HiTrap Heparin fraction inB. In C, purified Pfup41 andPfup46 were mixed and applied to HiTrap SP column. The peak fraction eluted at around 0.6 m NaCl was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE (lane 2). Lanes 1 and 3contain purified Pfup41 and Pfup46, respectively. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate whether Pfup41 and Pfup46 form a stable complex, the two purified proteins were mixed in an excess ratio of Pfup46 to Pfup41 and were subjected to cation-exchange chromatography. The Pfup41 andPfup46 proteins eluted together at a salt concentration of 0.6 m NaCl (the calculated pI of the complex is 9.2), whereas the free Pfup46 (calculated pI, 6.6) passed through the column in the pH 7.0 buffer. The peak fraction contained bothPfup41 and Pfup46 (Fig. 2 C, lane 2). The mixture of Pfup41 and Pfup46 was also applied to a gel filtration column (Superdex G-200), and a clear single peak, in which both Pfup41 and Pfup46 were included, was obtained. From the elution time, the apparent molecular mass of the complex was calculated to be about 90 kDa. This result indicates that the two proteins form a stable complex with a one to one molar ratio. A densitometric analysis of the band intensities of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gel for Pfup41 andPfup46 in the complex also supports the 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of the primase complex. To confirm the complex formation byPfup41 and Pfup46 in the cells, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using the P. furiosus cell extract. As shown in Fig.3, Pfup41 andPfup46 were coprecipitated with either anti-Pfup41 or anti-Pfup46 antiserum. The DNA polymerase I of P. furiosus, which is the only DNA polymerase having similar sequence to that of eukaryotic pol α, was not precipitated with either Pfup41 or Pfup46. Unlike the eukaryotic machinery, it seems likely that the primase does not form a stable complex with the DNA polymerase. We tried primase and polymerase reaction assays using the purified Pfup46 protein, as measured for Pfup41 in our previous study (22Bocquier A.A. Liu L. Cann I.K.O. Komori K. Kohda D. Ishino Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, neither activity was detected (data not shown). To investigate the role of Pfup46 in the primase complex, we first measured the DNA binding activity of the proteins using a gel-mobility shift assay (Fig. 4). The Pfup41 protein did not have a strong DNA binding activity (Fig. 4 A,lane 2). In contrast, with the same amount of thePfup46 protein, two clear shifted bands were observed in the cases of single-stranded (ss) and primed (pri) DNAs, probably derived from the complexes of the DNA with one and two Pfup46 molecules, respectively (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). The double-stranded DNA (ds) was less appropriate for Pfup46 binding, as expected. When the p41-p46 complex was used for the binding assay, one shifted band with a different mobility, showing the complex formation of (p41-p46)-DNA, was observed (Fig. 4 A,lane 4). To measure the difference of the DNA binding abilities among the primase molecules more precisely, a titration analysis was carried out. However, as shown in Fig. 4 B,Pfup41 seems to aggregate at higher concentrations. This characteristic of Pfup41 made it difficult to obtain the quantified data suitable for calculating Kd values. However, these results clearly indicate that Pfup46 protein increases the affinity of the primase to DNA by forming a complex with the catalytic Pfup41 subunit. We previously found that the Pfup41 protein synthesizes long DNA segments (up to several kilobases) on the template DNA without a primer (22Bocquier A.A. Liu L. Cann I.K.O. Komori K. Kohda D. Ishino Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tried this reaction using the p41-p46 complex and found that it also synthesizes DNA strands de novo. The amount of the synthesized products was drastically increased than that fromPfup41 alone. Quantification of the signals of these products showed ten times difference. However, the sizes of the DNA strands were less than 700 bases, which are notably shorter than those from Pfup41 (Fig.5 A). No increase of the product size was observed with longer reaction times (Fig.5 B). To investigate whether the synthesized primers can be extended by DNA polymerases from P. furiosus, pol I and pol II were added with their auxiliary proteins to the primase reaction mixtures containing M13 mp18 single-stranded DNA, dNTP (containing [α-32P]dCTP), and p41-p46 complex. As shown in Fig.5 C, in the presence of PfuPCNA andPfuRFC, pol I and pol II extended the primers. DNA (primer) synthesis activity of p41-p46 complex was not stimulated byPfuPCNA and PfuRFC. Furthermore, no product was observed when the p41-p46 complex was omitted from the reaction mixtures. These results indicate that the p41-p46 complex synthesized the primers, which can be extended in the combination with other replication proteins from P. furiosus. Primases from Bacteria and Eukarya synthesize ribooligonucleotides as the primer. However, in our previous study little activity to synthesize the ribooligomer was detected in Pfup41 in vitro(22Bocquier A.A. Liu L. Cann I.K.O. Komori K. Kohda D. Ishino Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the p41-p46 complex can synthesize an RNA primer, we performed the assay using M13 mp18 single-stranded DNA and an NTP mixture containing [α-32P]UTP and found that the p41-p46 complex synthesized 12–40-base-long RNA primers. The RNA primers were extended by pol I, pol II, and also by the p41-p46 complex itself, when the dNTP mixture was added after the synthesis reaction of the RNA primers (data not shown). In an attempt to determine which type of primer (DNA or RNA) is synthesized de novo in theP. furiosus cells, we tried the primer synthesis assay in the presence of both dNTPs and NTPs. The primase complex synthesized RNA segments only when NTPs (containing [α-32P]UTP), but not dNTPs, were added as the substrates, as described above. However, we detected a dose-dependent decrease in labeled RNA products with increasing dNTP concentrations of the reactions. When the product amount from the reaction with only NTPs is 100%, the products were decreased to 57%, 41%, and less than 15% in the presence of dNTPs at 1/1000, 1/100, and 1/10, respectively, relative to the amount of NTPs. When both dNTPs and NTPs existed at equal concentrations, no RNA products were observed from the reaction containing [α-32P]UTP (data not shown). This result indicates that the p41-p46 primase preferentially uses dNTPs. However, in the opposite case of detecting a DNA primer using [α-32P]dCTP, the DNA strand synthesis was stimulated by the addition of NTPs. By addition of NTPs to 1, 10, and 100 μm, the amounts of the reaction products were increased to 1.7-, 4.0-, and 5.3-fold, respectively, relative to the product from the reaction without NTPs. This stimulation of DNA strand synthesis was also observed with ATP to the same level as NTPs (data not shown). Furtheremore, the in vitro replication assay of the M13 mp18 single-stranded DNA using P. furiosus replication proteins, p41-p46, pol I, PfuPCNA, and PfuRFC, as described above, revealed that the amount of full-length product was increased by the addition of ATP, but not by the other three nucleotides (Fig.6, A and B). When a synthetic DNA primer was annealed to M13 DNA template instead ofde novo primer synthesis by p41-p46 in the reaction, no enhancement of production was observed by either ATP or NTPs (Fig.6 C). These results suggest that the primer synthesis possibly starts by RNA using ATP de novo in the initiation step of DNA replication in P. furiosus, as found in other organisms of the different biological domains. To investigate the initiation step of the primer synthesis more directly, the reactions using [γ-32P]ATP and cold dNTPs were performed. As shown in Fig. 7, synthesized strands of 700 bases in length were detected by autoradiography. The amount of the labeled products was clearly decreased with increased additions of cold ATP. The labeled products were slightly decreased by addition of cold GTP, and no effect was observed by cold CTP and UTP. The amount of the ATP-labeled products was not decreased by addition of increasing amount of cold dATP in the reaction mixtures (data not shown). These results suggest that the p41-p46 primase can discriminate ATP from other NTPs to start primer synthesis.Figure 7Synthesis of the 5′-terminal labeled primers by [γ-32P]ATP was clearly inhibited by addition of cold ATP, but not other NTPs. The reaction mixture containing M13 mp18 ssDNA, p41-p46 complex, [γ-32P]ATP, and dNTPs was incubated at 70 °C for 45 min with increasing amount of NTPs (0.5, 5, and 50 μm, respectively). The reaction products were analyzed by 8% PAGE containing 8 m urea followed by autoradiography.Lane − indicates the reaction without cold NTPs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We identified the DNA primase complex in the hyperthermophilic archaeon, P. furiosus. Pfup41 and Pfup46, which have some sequence similarity to the eukaryotic primase subunits, exist as a stable complex and may work as the primase in the replication machinery of P. furiosus. The eukaryotic primases exist as a complex with pol α. By analogy with this case, we investigated whether the P. furiosus p41-p46 complex directly interacts with P. furiosus pol I (pol BI), because pol I is the only DNA polymerase that belongs to the family B DNA polymerases, including eukaryotic pol α, in P. furiosus (8Ishino Y. Cann I.K.O. Genes Genet. Syst. 1998; 73: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 11Uemori T. Ishino Y. Toh H. Asada K. Kato I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). No coprecipitation of Pfup41 and pol I was observed with either anti-Pfup41 or anti-pol I (Fig. 3). The results suggest that pol I is not the functional counterpart of the eukaryotic pol α in P. furiosus. In the eukaryotic replication machinery, it is believed that the de novo synthesis of RNA primer is performed by p48, and then the primers are extended by pol α by translocation of the active sites from p48 to p180 in the pol α-pri complex. Based on the evidence that the P. furiosusp41-p46 complex can synthesize short RNA segments and long DNA segments by itself in vitro, the p41-p46 complex may have dual functions in Archaea: de novo primer synthesis and its elongation. The synthesized DNA strands are then presumably further extended by the replicative DNA polymerases, pol I and/or pol II. The interactions of the PfuRPA with other replication proteins (pol I, pol II, PfuPCNA, and PfuRFC), including the primase, as we showed previously by the immunoprecipitation experiments (19Komori K. Ishino Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25654-25660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Bocquier A.A. Liu L. Cann I.K.O. Komori K. Kohda D. Ishino Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 452-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), support the idea that the p41-p46 complex is involved in the replisome in P. furiosus cells. In eukaryotes, both pol δ and pol ε have proofreading activity and express high processivity when combined with PCNA. Our preliminary results showed that neither Pfup41 nor the p41-p46 complex has 3′-5′ exonuclease activity, which suggests that the archaeal primase has very low fidelity. 2S. Ishino and Y. Ishino, unpublished results. It would be detrimental to the cells that an enzyme without proofreading activity synthesizes long DNA strands by itself. The Pfup41 subunit synthesizes long DNA strands up to several kilobases in vitro, and therefore,Pfup46 may have an essential function to suppress this long DNA synthesis. In the eukaryotic system, after the primase synthesizes a primer, pol α and primase become coordinated such that further primer synthesis is negatively regulated by the formation of the stable primer-template formation, which is likely to be associated with pol α-primase (25Sheaff R. Kuchta R.D. Ilsley D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2247-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 26Arezi B. Kirk B.W. Copeland W.C. Kuchta R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12899-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that the eukaryotic p58 subunit mediates the transfer of primers from the primase active site to pol α (26Arezi B. Kirk B.W. Copeland W.C. Kuchta R.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12899-12907Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results of our study imply that the archaeal p46 subunit has similar functions as those of the eukaryotic p58, although the archaeal primase may extend the strand by using dNTPs from the RNA primer by itself without switching to any other polymerase, as described above. It would be very interesting and important to determine which primer (RNA or DNA) is synthesized de novo in the DNA replication process in P. furiosus cells. Our in vitrostudies could not reach this conclusion. It is known that the eukaryotic primase forms a primase-ssDNA-NTP-NTP quaternary complex to start the RNA primer on the template, and purine nucleotides are more preferable than pyrimidines to form this initiation complex. This initiation of primer synthesis is the rate-determining step (27Sheaff R. Kuchita R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3027-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the case of the human primase, the p48-p58 complex, but not p48 alone, can initiate the dinucleotide synthesis using ribonucleotide triphosphates (24Copeland W.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our data showing that the p41-p46 complex, but not p41 alone, can synthesize RNA primer are consistent with the idea that the role of the second subunit is to assist in primer initiation. Furthermore, the fact that ATP stimulated the strand synthesis reaction of the p41-p46 primase (Figs. 6 and 7) implies that the archaeal primer starts with ribonucleotide(s) in the cells. Isolation and characterization of the Okazaki fragments from the archaeal cells are necessary for further clarification. The sequence search for the primases in the total genomes of several archaeal organisms has yielded some interesting aspects. All of the euryarchaeal organisms, including M. jannaschii, Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus (Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum), Archaeoglobus fulgidus, andHalobacterium sp. NRC-1, as well as Pyrococcals, have open reading frames homologous to Pfup41 and Pfup46. The two ORFs are located in tandem in the genomes of the Pyrococcals and the M. thermoautotrophicus and probably form an operon. It is very interesting that M. thermoautotrophicus, A. fulgidus, and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 have two p41-like ORFs in their genomes. In the crenarchaeal organisms, one ORF similar to p41 was found in the total genome sequences of Aeropyrum pernix, Sulfolobus solfataricus, and Sulfolobus tokodaii, respectively. On the other hand, a p46-like ORF is found in Sulfolobus, but not in A. pernix from our analyses. The p46 subunit of A. pernix DNA primase may be highly divergent from other archaeal primases. The sequence analysis of the eukaryotic type DNA primases are also shown on a website (chem-mgriep2.unl.edu/replic/EukPri1AA.html). The COG (clusters of orthologous groups of proteins) data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/) includes one ORF from A. pernix in the multiple alignment of the eukaryotic p58-like proteins. Further analyses are necessary to understand the conservation and the diversity of the archaeal primases. The isolation of the novel Pfup46 protein and demonstration of archaeal primase function presented in this study significantly contributes to the understanding of the DNA priming process in archaeal DNA replication. Furthermore, due to the similar structure and function of the primase proteins, detailed studies on the archaeal primase function will give further insights into the molecular mechanism of more complicated eukaryotic DNA replication.

As the first step in visual signal transduction, photoisomerized rhodopsin triggers hydrolysis of cGMP by activating a G-protein, transducin, that subsequently stimulates a cGMP phosphodiesterase, PDE6, and this causes cGMP-gated cation channels to close (see Refs. 1Baylor D.

Both rods and cones can quickly recover to their resting potential after the excitation induced by a non-saturating flash of light. Exposure of photoreceptors to a constant illumination at first saturates their response, but through a complex process of light adaptation, the cells can reopen cGMP-gated cation channels and partially restore their light sensitivity. Ca2+-sensitive synthesis of cGMP by membrane guanylyl cyclase (retGC)1plays one of the major roles among multiple reactions that result in reopening of the cGMP-gated channels during recovery and light adaptation (4Koch K.W.

A Na+/Ca2+,K+-exchanger continuously extrudes Ca2+ ions from the photoreceptor outer segment; therefore, when cGMP is hydrolyzed and the Na+/Ca2+ influx is stopped, the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in rods and cones can decrease from near 500–600 nm in the dark down to 50 nm in the light (6Gray-Keller M.P.

Disruption of both GCAP-1 and GCAP-2 genes results in abnormally slow recovery in mouse rods, especially in response to strong flash of light, consistently with the expected slower accumulation of cGMP in the absence of GCAPs. Although the relative contribution of GCAP-1 and -2 to the kinetics of dim flash responses in rods and cones remains unclear, GCAP-2 in vitro stimulates the activity of both known isozymes of retGC (retGC-1 and -2) present in photoreceptor membranes (20Lowe D.G.

Pauls T.L. Shwaller B. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 15-20Google Scholar, 23Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) within the EF-hand superfamily. Similar to other members of this family, GCAPs are 24-kDa N-fatty-acylated proteins that contain four helix-turn-helix EF-hand structures (EF-1 through EF-4, Fig. 1), of which three (EF-2, -3, and -4) determine Ca2+sensitivity of GCAPs. Similarly to other proteins of this group, in the first EF-hand domain, EF-1, the amino acid sequence corresponding to the Ca2+-binding loop is disrupted and does not have all of the proper side chain residues required for binding Ca2+ion (22Nef P.

J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In their Ca2+-free form GCAPs stimulate the activity of guanylyl cyclase, but upon binding Ca2+ they undergo an activator-to-inhibitor transition (24Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. J. Biol.

Ca2+-free GCAP-2 can itself form a stable homodimer that can be detected by high resolution gel chromatography (28Olshevskaya E.V. Ermilov A.N. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25583-25587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Its dimerization is highly Ca2+-sensitive so that Ca2+-loaded GCAP-2 quickly dissociates into monomers (28Olshevskaya E.V. Ermilov A.N. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25583-25587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Previous results indicate that dimerization of the Ca2+-free GCAP-2 is likely to be a part of a mechanism (“dimer-adapter” hypothesis) by which it modulates the interaction between the cyclase subunits (9Dizhoor A.M. Cell Signal. 2000; 12: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Olshevskaya E.V. Ermilov A.N. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25583-25587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).The three-dimensional structure of Ca2+-loaded GCAP-2 is very similar to that of recoverin and neurocalcin (29Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), although the structure of the Ca2+-free (activator) form of GCAP-2 remains undetermined. Potential binding sites for GCAP-2 in retGC have been studied using synthetic peptides, chemical cross-linking, and deletion analyses. According to these studies, there are several fragments in retGC kinase homology and catalytic domains that can make contact with GCAPs (30Sokal I. Haeseleer F. Arendt A. Adman E.T. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1387-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Lange C. Duda T. Beyermann M. Sharma R.K. Koch K.W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30648-30654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, the location of the binding sites for retGC within the GCAP-2 molecule remains rather obscure. Previous efforts to map functionally significant regions in GCAP-2 using GCAP-2/neurocalcin and GCAP-2/recoverin chimeras or deletion mutants revealed that in addition to the three Ca2+-binding EF-hand loops, there were three segments of the molecule that could not be exchanged for the corresponding regions from other recoverin-like proteins without loss of GCAP function as a Ca2+-sensitive cyclase regulator (33Olshevskaya E.V.

Surprisingly, one of those three regions, Lys29–Phe48, included the first EF-hand-like motif that lost its ability to bind Ca2+. In the present paper, we demonstrate that various point mutations in this region can specifically inhibit interactions of GCAP-2 with the target enzyme. All tested EF-1 mutants of GCAP-2 that were unable to stimulate or inhibit the cyclase were still able to form dimers in the absence of Ca2+, similar to the wild type GCAP-2. We conclude that the first EF-hand-like motif in GCAP-2 participates in targeting retGC. These results are consistent with the model according to which GCAP-2 must have two independent functional contact surfaces, one for binding to the effector enzyme and the other for dimerization of the Ca2+-free GCAP-2. We speculate that the ability to bind Ca2+ within the first EF-hand of GCAP-2 was lost in exchange for the ability to interact with the target cyclase.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBased on its NMR structure determined by Ames et al. (29Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), GCAP-2 is similar to recoverin and neurocalcin and consists of two globular pairs of EF-hand structures connected by a “hinge” region between EF-2 and EF-3 (Fig. 1). Three EF-hands (EF-2, -3, and -4) contribute to the functional switch that causes GCAP-2 to undergo an “activator-to-inhibitor” transition when it binds Ca2+ (EC50Ca ∼ 200–300 nm, Hill coefficient ∼ 1.7–2.1, Ref. 8Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. Methods. 1999; 19: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Three Ca2+ ions bind to GCAP-2 with an apparentK d(Ca) of ∼300 nm and the cooperativity factor of 2 (29Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Unlike these three EF-hands, the first EF-hand-related motif is short of several key side chain residues necessary for high affinity binding of Ca2+. To efficiently coordinate Ca2+ ion in the EF-hand loop by five side chain residues and one carbonyl oxygen of the main chain (36Strynadka N.C. James M.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Celio M.R. Pauls T.L. Shwaller B. Guidebook to the Calcium-binding Proteins.in: Celio M.R. Pauls T.L. Shwaller B. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 15-20Google Scholar, 38Kawasaki H. Kretsinger R.H. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 343-517PubMed Google Scholar), it is required that the first Ca2+-coordinating position (X) of the 12-amino acid consensus motif be occupied by Asp, and both the positions 3 (Y) and 9 (−X) include oxygen-containing side chain residues (36Strynadka N.C. James M.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 951-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of the first invariant Asp (replaced by Glu33) of the consensus motif and replacement of the obligatory oxygen-containing side chain residues by Cys35 (Y) and Phe41(−X) prohibit Ca2+ from binding within the loop structure of the EF-1 domain (16Dizhoor A.M. Olshevskaya E.V. Henzel W.J. Wong S.C. Stults J.T. Ankoudinova I. Hurley J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25200-25206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 29Ames J.B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).Although the EF-1 domain is unable to bind Ca2+, its amino acid sequence remains highly homologous between recoverin-like proteins, except for several variable residues that are specific for each particular member of the family (23Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Also, regardless of its deviation from the EF-hand Ca2+ binding consensus motif, EF-1 retains an overall shape of a helix-loop-helix domain similar to other EF-hands (29Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).A previous observation (33Olshevskaya E.V. Boikov S. Ermilov A. Krylov D. Hurley J.B. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10823-10832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) indicated that the EF-1 was an essential part of the GCAP-2 molecule. Substitution of that domain in GCAP-2 with the corresponding segment from neurocalcin resulted in a loss of GCAP-2 activity. Yet the functional role of the EF-1 remained unclear. The uncertainty has been 2-fold. First, the retGC activator form of GCAP-2 can associate as a homodimer and dissociate in the presence of Ca2+. The inability of several GCAP-2 chimera mutants to form Ca2+-free dimers correlated with the lack of their ability to promote retGC activation in the absence of Ca2+ (28Olshevskaya E.V. Ermilov A.N. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25583-25587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, the EF-1 could be involved in either target binding or dimerization of GCAP-2 (or both). Second, it could not be completely excluded that substitutions of a relatively large segment in the molecule, even with the corresponding fragment from a homologous protein, causes general misfolding of the protein. To further elucidate the possible functional role of the EF-1 domain in GCAP-2, we probed this region by single mutations that substituted some highly conserved (Cys35, Glu44) or variable (Lys30, Glu33, Phe41, His43, Phe48) amino acids (Fig. 1).We have found that activation of retGC at low Ca2+ concentrations is highly sensitive to even single substitutions in most of these amino acid residues (Fig.2, A–F). One of the invariant residues within the EF-1 motif of recoverin-like proteins is Cys35. Substitution of Cys35 with Ser (Fig.2 B) or Thr (data not shown) noticeably affects retGC activation, and replacing it with positively or negatively charged amino acids strongly suppresses the ability of GCAP-2 to activate the cyclase. The most dramatic effect has been observed in the case of negatively charged Asp that renders the mutant protein virtually inactive. Another fairly highly conserved amino acid residue, Glu44, is also essential for retGC activation because its substitution even with another acidic residue, Asp, causes a prominent decrease in activity of GCAP-2, whereas its substitution with a non-charged oxygen-containing side chain, Ser, completely inactivates the retGC stimulating activity of the Ca2+-free GCAP-2 (Fig. 2 E).Figure 2Activation of retinal membrane guanylyl cyclase by GCAP-2 and its mutants in various positions within the EF-1.

Some of the substitutions markedly or even completely suppressed cyclase stimulation (for example, K30G, F41I, H43E, H43Q, F48V, F48S).Apparently, some amino acid side chain residues within the EF-1 domain are not essential for the interaction with the cyclase (Fig. 2,G and H). For example, we did not find evidence that replacement of Glu33 with Gln, or even positively charged Lys, can seriously affect retGC activation. The side chain of Tyr81 (which is a part of the exiting helix in the second EF-hand) is located in close proximity to the amino acid residues of the EF-1 structure (Ref. 29Ames J.B. Dizhoor A.M. Ikura M. Palczewski K. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19329-19337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It can be replaced with the amino acids not found in this position in GCAPs, Ile or Phe, without a prominent effect on cyclase activation (Fig. 2 H).Why would different mutations within the EF-1 domain affect retGC activation? If the amino acid residues in the EF-1 were required for GCAP-2 binding to the cyclase, then one would expect to find mutations within this domain that reduce the apparent affinity of GCAP-2 in our retGC activation assay. Indeed, several substitutions that reduced GCAP-2 activity apparently decreased its affinity for the cyclase. For example, the C35T and the C35S GCAP-2 mutants had their EC50 values increased 2.5- and 6-fold, respectively, compared with the wild type GCAP-2, whereas at saturation (above 2.5 μm, data not shown) both GCAP-2 mutants fully activated retGC (to 103 and 100% of the wild type control level, data not shown). Similarly to that, the H43Q mutant had at least 10-fold higher EC50, but at saturation (above 10 μm GCAP-2) the cyclase stimulation reached 88% of the wild type control level.In several cases (i.e. C35D, C35K, F41I, E44S, F48S) retGC activation by the GCAP-2 mutants remained very low and did not reach saturation in the conditions of the assay. For that reason, we were unable to reliably evaluate the exact values of their EC50, but it appeared increased at least 5–10-fold. In addition to that, we found that some mutations affected the maximal level of retGC activation rather than EC50. The EC50 increase in the case of the F48V mutant was only within 2-fold, but the cyclase activation at saturation did not exceed 30% of the wild type control.The right shift of a dose dependence curve in case of the EF-1 mutants could be in a most simplified manner interpreted as a decrease in retGC binding affinity. It would be more difficult to explain the lower level of maximal cyclase activation found in some cases. At this point, we cannot offer any conclusive explanation for this phenomenon. Activation of the cyclase may require multiple steps, and various conformational changes in GCAP-2 may have to occur before retGC is activated. Perhaps the EF-1 domain may not only be involved in binding interactions with the cyclase but also through the intramolecular interactions influence other functional domains of GCAP-2 (for instance, EF-2) and thus affect the overall conformational switch in GCAP-2. However, our present results also strongly indicate that despite its inability to bind Ca2+, the N-terminal EF-hand domain in GCAP-2 is an essential part of the molecule that is important for targeting retGC.GCAP-2 can form a complex with guanylyl cyclase both in its Ca2+-free and Ca2+-loaded form (8Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. Methods. 1999; 19: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 39Laura R.P. Hurley J.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11264-11271Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Instead of activating the cyclase, Ca2+-loaded GCAP-2 inhibits basal activity of retGC in washed photoreceptor membranes (8Dizhoor A.M. Hurley J.B. Methods. 1999; 19: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), arguably by interfering with reversible dimerization of retGC (26Yu H. Olshevskaya E. Duda T. Seno K. Hayashi F. Sharma R.K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25583-25587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of some of the GCAP-2 mutants in the EF-1 domain to inhibit cyclase basal activity at saturating Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 3). We have found that several mutants that have lower ability to stimulate retGC in their Ca2+-free form are also less efficient as inhibitors of the cyclase basal activity. This appears to be consistent with the EF-1 domain of GCAP-2 being involved in the interaction with the cyclase both in the absence and in the presence of Ca2+.Figure 3Inhibition of retGC basal activity by Ca2+-loaded GCAP-2 mutants at saturating free Ca2+ concentrations (∼10−5m).

The conditions of the assay are described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It seems highly unlikely that different single amino acid substitutions within the EF-1 would all be a result of a general nonspecific misfolding of the protein. It is much more likely that these mutations directly affect the cyclase-binding site. However, both wild type and EF-1 mutants of GCAP-2 used in this study were isolated as Ca2+-loaded monomers (data not shown) using a previously described technique (28Olshevskaya E.V. Ermilov A.N. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25583-25587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At the same time, according to our previous observations, Ca2+-free GCAP-2 undergoes dimerization, which is likely to contribute to the cyclase regulation by promoting the interaction between two retGC subunits (28Olshevskaya E.V. Ermilov A.N. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25583-25587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This Ca2+-sensitive dimerization of GCAP-2 apparently involves multiple regions in the GCAP-2 molecule (28Olshevskaya E.V. Ermilov A.N. Dizhoor A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25583-25587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Hence, the GCAP-2 mutants tested in the present study could be inactive because of a nonspecific misfolding of the protein. On the other hand, if the EF-1 were specifically required for the Ca2+-sensitive dimerization of GCAP-2, rather than retGC binding, that could also account for the absence of their activity. However, in both cases we would expect that the inactive GCAP-2 mutants failed to form dimers in the absence of Ca2+. Contrary to that, all tested EF-1 mutants, even those that completely lost their ability to regulate the cyclase, were able to dimerize at low Ca2+ concentration (Fig.4, results with the rest of the GCAP-2 mutants are not shown, but all of them formed dimers in a Ca2+-free solution). These results strongly argue that 1) individual point mutations within the EF-1 domain do not cause general nonspecific misfolding of the protein and 2) these mutations specifically affect GCAP-2 interactions with retGC rather than the GCAP/GCAP interactions (as illustrated in Fig.5).Figure 4Ca2+-free GCAP-2 mutants within the EF-1 region remain capable of forming dimers.

B, mutations within the EF-1 domain of GCAP-1 inactivate retGC regulation but do not abolish GCAP/GCAP dimer formation; therefore, it is most likely that the specific role of EF-1 is to make a contact surface for binding for the cyclase (or at least a part of such surface) in GCAP-2.

Carlson K.S. Smith B.T. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L575-L580PubMed Google Scholar). In late gestation, CCT activity increases in alveolar type II cells (3Zimmermann L.J. Hogan M. Carlson K.S. Smith B.T. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L575-L580PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hogan M. Zimmermann L.J. Wang J. Kuliszewski M. Liu J. Post M. Am. J.

Acta. 1974; 344: 241-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). There is a corresponding loss of intracellular glycogen stores, as the lung generates the necessary surfactant to establish respiration (3Zimmermann L.J. Hogan M. Carlson K.S. Smith B.T. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L575-L580PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hogan M. Zimmermann L.J. Wang J. Kuliszewski M. Liu J. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L25-L32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Taderera J.V.

High levels of PC production are a continued necessity postpartum and throughout life to maintain functional levels of pulmonary surfactant. The activity of CCT is strongly affiliated with its association to phospholipid bilayers (for reviews see Refs. 7Pelech S.L. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 217-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar and 8Tronchere H. Record M. Terce F. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 137-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Unbound CCT appears to have little or no activity whereas bound CCT is active. Many factors have been identified in controlling CCT lipid binding, including the phosphorylation state of its carboxyl terminus and the composition of the target membrane (9Arnold R.S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6149-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Arnold R.S. Cornell R.B.

The dependence of CCT activity on lipid binding makes the localization of CCT in a cell an important factor for CCT function. To date, three CCT isoforms have been identified: CCTα, CCTβ1, and CCTβ2 (13Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The CCTβs are splice variants of the same gene, differing at their carboxyl termini (14Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). CCTα is encoded by a separate gene and differs from CCTβ at the amino and carboxyl termini (14Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Based on sedimentation experiments, both CCT forms were thought to be cytosolic and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-bound (15Pelech S.L. Pritchard P.H. Brindley D.N. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6782-6788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cornell R. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 919: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Watkins J.D. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5686-5692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated a predominant partitioning of CCTα to the nucleus in several cell lines and rat liver slices (14Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26240-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Other indirect immunofluorescence and electron microscopic studies revealed that both CCT forms are cytosolic as well as nuclear in primary hepatocytes (18Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Houweling M. Cui Z. Anfuso C.D. Bussiere M. Chen M.H. Vance D.E. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 55-63PubMed Google Scholar). Recent direct immunofluorescence analysis of cell lines transfected with enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-CCTα supported the nuclear partitioning of CCTα (21DeLong C.J. Qin L. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32325-32330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The CCTα form contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS), and removal of the NLS motif in CCTα has been shown to result in a cytoplasmic as well as nuclear localization (18Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wang Y. MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 354-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence with CCTβ-specific antibodies has shown that the CCTβ isoforms, which lack the amino-terminal NLS, are confined to the ER (13Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The relevance of nuclear localized CCTα remains unclear. In IIC9 fibroblast cells, CCTα has been found to shuttle from the nucleus to the cytoplasm during G0 → G1 transition, suggesting that CCTα is sequestered to the nucleus until it is required (19Northwood I.C. Tong A.H. Crawford B. Drobnies A.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26240-26248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Although the nuclear localization of CCTα is recently held as a universal phenomenon, no studies have been performed on pulmonary epithelial cell lines or on pulmonary tissues. Herein, we investigated the localization of CCTα in lung epithelial cell lines, primary cultured fetal rat lung epithelium, and whole lung tissue from fetal and adult mice. In all cases, CCTα was excluded from the nucleus indicating that nuclear localization of CCTα is not universal to all tissues. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells and human pulmonary epithelial cells (A549) cells were from American tissue Culture Collection. Mouse lung epithelial MLE-15 cells were a generous gift from Dr. Jeff Whitsett (Cincinnati, OH). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins encompassing either the first 31 amino acids of the amino terminus (anti-CCT-N) or the last 45 amino acids of the carboxyl terminus of rat lung CCT (anti-CCT-C). In addition, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 164–176 of rat lung CCT (anti-CCT-M). We have previously shown that purified rat CCTα as well as baculovirus-expressed recombinant rat CCTα were recognized by all three antibodies (23Zimmermann L.J. Lee W.S. Smith B.T. Post M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar,24Yang J. Wang J. Tseu I. Kuliszewski M. Lee W. Post M. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to calnexin (endoplasmic marker), HA, and FLAG were from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO), BAbCO, (Richmond, CA) and Sigma (St. Louis, MO), respectively. Polyclonal antibodies against HA (BAbCO, Richmond, CA) and FLAG (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc.) were used to confirm observations made with the monoclonal antibodies. Pregnant rats were sacrificed by diethyl ether exposure on day 19 of gestation (term = 22 days). Fetuses and lungs were aseptically removed, and lung epithelial cells were isolated as previously described (23Zimmermann L.J. Lee W.S. Smith B.T. Post M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 25Caniggia I. Tseu I. Han R.N. Smith B.T. Tanswell K. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L424-L433PubMed Google Scholar,26Jassal D. Han R.N. Caniggia I. Post M. Tanswell A.K. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1991; 27A: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CHO-K1, A549, MLE-15, and RFLE cells were plated into plastic 12-well culture plates. The next day, the cells were rinsed with serum-free minimal essential medium (MEM) and incubated with serum-free MEM containing 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Oakville). After 5 h of incubation, the medium was removed and the cells were washed with serum-free MEM. Following trypsinization to remove the cells from the plate, cellular lipids were extracted according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Bochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Fifty microliters of the cell suspension was used to determine the number of cells per well. PC was isolated from the lipid extract by thin-layer chromatography on Silica Gel H plates with CHCl3/MeOH/H2O (65:25:4, v/v) as developing solution. PC was visualized with a bromothymol blue solution. Bands were scraped from the surface of the plate, placed in scintillation vials with scintillation mixture, and counted on a Wallac 1219 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter. For expression of EGFP-tagged CCTα protein in cells, the cDNA encoding for full-length CCTα was inserted into pEGFP expression vectors (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with EGFP being at either the amino or carboxyl termini of CCTα, named pEGFP-CCTα or pCCTα-EGFP, respectively. An HA epitope sequence (YPYDVPDYA) was affixed to the amino terminus of full-length CCTα and a flag epitope sequence (DYKDDDDK) was affixed to the carboxyl terminus of full-length CCTα. Both constructs were inserted into a pMP6a expression vector (generous gift of Dr. M. Philip, Applied Immune Sciences Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The resultant plasmids, CCTα-EGFP, EGFP-CCTα, HA-CCTα, and CCTα-FLAG, respectively, were purified and transiently transfected into CHO-K1, A549, MLE-15, and FRLE cells, using cationic liposomes and plasmid DNA at a ratio of 10:1. For EGFP controls, EGFP plasmids without CCTα insert were tested with the same cell lines. The SPC-CCTα vector was constructed using the full-length rat CCTα (4Hogan M. Zimmermann L.J. Wang J. Kuliszewski M. Liu J. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L25-L32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A FLAG sequence (DYKDDDDK) was connected to the carboxyl terminus of CCTα. The 1.2-kb FLAG-tagged CCTα cDNA was subcloned 3′ of the 3.7-kb human SP-C promoter (28Korfhagen T.R. Glasser S.W. Wert S.E. Bruno M.D. Daugherty C.C. McNeish J.D. Stock J.L. Potter S.S. Whitsett J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6122-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and 5′ of the SV40 small T intron and polyadenylation sequences. The expression cassette was excised with NdeI andNotI, purified using Glass Milk (Geneclean Kit Bio101, BioCan, Canada) and Elutip-D columns (Schleicher and Schuell, NY), and ethanol-precipitated. Transgenic embryos were generated according to Hogan et al. (4Hogan M. Zimmermann L.J. Wang J. Kuliszewski M. Liu J. Post M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L25-L32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA injections into the pronuclei of (C57BL/6 × SJL) F2 embryos were carried out at a concentration of 3 ng/μl. Of the total of nine embryos at 18 days post coitus, three were transgenic; of the total of seven newborns, two were transgenic. The genotype was established by polymerase chain reaction analysis and confirmed by Southern blot analysis. The primers used were 5′-TCACCTCTGTCCCCTCTCCCTACG-3′ (SP-C primer for 5′) and 5′-TGCCTGCTTCCTTGATGTGCTTAT-3′ (CCTα primer for 3′). Cells transfected with pEGFP-CCTα or pCCTα-EGFP was observed after 48 h under a Zeiss LSM500e confocal microscope. Digital images of cells were recorded. Sf9 cells transfected with rat CCTα (24Yang J. Wang J. Tseu I. Kuliszewski M. Lee W. Post M. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or untransfected MLE-15 cells were washed with PBS, lysed in homogenization buffer using a Dounce homogenizer. Homogenates were diluted in Laemmli loading buffer to a final concentration of 25 μg/μl for Sf9 cells and 40 μg/μl for MLE-15 cells and then were boiled for 5 min. Samples (250 μg for Sf9 cells and 40 μg for MLE-15 cells) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and then electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the nitrocellulose membrane with 3% (w/v) powdered skim milk in PBS at 4 °C for 60 min, then 1:100 diluted rabbit anti-CCT antisera was added to detect CCT in the homogenates. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, the nitrocellulose membrane was washed three times with PBS, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:20,000) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then thoroughly washed with cold PBS (5 × 5 min) and detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells seeded on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). Coverslips were then washed with PBS and treated successively with 5% (w/v) normal goat serum (NGS) and 0.1% (w/v) BSA in PBS (NGS/BSA) for 1 h, first antibody solution in NGS/BSA overnight at 4 °C and fluorescein (FITC)- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody solution in NGS/BSA for an additional hour, with liberal washing with PBS in each interval. Rabbit anti-CT antisera (anti-CCT-N, anti-CCT-M, anti-CCT-C) and/or mouse anti-calnexin anti-HA or anti-FLAG were diluted 1:50 and used as primary antibodies. The FITC- and rhodamine-labeled secondary antibodies to rabbit (goat anti-rabbit) and mouse (goat anti-mouse) IgG were diluted 1:300 and 1:100, respectively. Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with mounting medium alone or mounting medium with propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells were then observed under a Leitz Laborlux epifluorescence microscope equipped with a fluorescence filter. Digital images of cells were recorded using a Leica DC200 camera. Pregnant female mice were sacrificed by exposure to diethyl ether on either day 17 or day 18 of a timed pregnancy (term = 22 days). Fetuses were aseptically removed, and lungs rinsed with 1 unit/ml heparin in PBS to remove blood. Fetal lungs were then incubated for 20 min in 12% (w/v) sucrose in 2 volumes of PBS to 1 volume Tissue-Tek OCT Compound (OCT) (Sakura, Torrance CA). Adult mouse lungs were perfused with 1:1 PBS:OCT through the trachea. All lungs were then coated with OCT and frozen on dry ice. Six-micron frozen sections were used for indirect immunofluorescence. Frozen sections were fixed with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed three times in PBS, and permeabilized with 2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Sections were then blocked with 3% (v/v) normal goat serum and 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were incubated with diluted anti-CCT-N (1:100), anti-CCT-M (1:100), anti-CCT-C (1:100), pre-immune serum (1:100), or anti-FLAG M2 (1:150) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Following repeated washes in PBS, the sections were exposed to goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse FITC- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies at a 1:75 dilution in PBS. Samples were imaged with a Zeiss LSM500e confocal microscope. Cells were cultured in 15-cm2 tissue culture flasks until nearly confluent. The cells were then washed three times in PBS and scraped from the surface of culture plates. Lung tissue was removed from mouse or rat and rinsed in 1 unit/ml heparin in PBS to remove blood and then minced in ∼1-mm pieces. Cells were washed three times in PBS and fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde for 1 h. Following three washes in PBS, samples were transferred to beam capsules, dehydrated through an alcohol series, and incubated in 1:1 lowicryl KM4:100% ethanol. The samples were placed in 100% lowicryl KM4 overnight with repeated changes. The lowicryl was polymerized by exposure to UV light overnight at −20 °C. For freeze substitution, minced tissues were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and 0.1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde for 1 h. They were incubated overnight in 1% (v/v) sucrose in PBS overnight for cryoprotection and frozen with liquid nitrogen. The tissues were permitted to dehydrate slowly in 3% (w/v) uranyl acetate in 100% methanol at −20 °C over 4 days. The methanol was switched for 1:1 lowicryl HM20:100% methanol for 2 days at −20 °C followed by several changes of 100% lowicryl HM20 (8 h per change). The samples were then exposed to UV light overnight at −20 °C to polymerize the lowicryl. Ultrathin sections of these samples were cut using a diamond knife on a Reichert Ultracut microtome to light gold thickness and floated onto Formvar-coated 300-mesh nickel grids. Grids were treated with a series of blocking solutions: 0.5% (w/v) glycine, 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS for 10 min, and three changes of 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS, 10 min each. Primary antibodies were added to the samples diluted in 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS. The final concentrations of the primary antibodies were 1:150 of anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1:100 for anti-CCT-N, anti-CCT-M, and anti-CCT-C. Following 1 h of incubation, samples were washed four times, 10 min each in 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS. Ten-nanometer gold-conjugated antibodies (goat anti-mouse secondaries for samples incubated with anti-FLAG primaries or goat anti-rabbit secondaries for samples incubated with anti-CT primaries) were diluted 1:20 in 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS and spun 10 min at 10,000 rpm in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube at 4 °C. The grid samples were incubated with the supernatant for 1 h at room temperature in a humid chamber. Grids were washed three times in PBS and then three times in double-distilled water, 10 min per wash. Finally the samples were stained 10 min in 3% (w/v) uranyl acetate in double-distilled water, 5 min in 1% (w/v) lead citrate followed by double-wash distilled water to remove excess stain. Samples were examined on a Philips 430 electron microscope. Controls included: omission of primary antibodies and samples treated with pre-immune serum (at 1:100 dilution). First, we evaluated the rate of PC synthesis in the different cell types (Fig.1a). Incorporation of radioactive choline into PC was similar for CHO-K1 and FRLE cells. The rate of PC synthesis of A549 and MLE-15 cells was approximately half of that of CHO-K1 and FRLE cells. To determine if CCTβ was expressed, we performed RT-polymerase chain reaction analysis using CCTβ-specific primers (14Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Both CHO-K1 cells and fetal rat lung expressed small amounts of CCTβ mRNA whereas no message was detected in any of the other samples (data not shown). Similar findings have been previously reported (13Lykidis A. Murti K.G. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14022-14029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 14Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9699-9708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, PC synthesis of pulmonary epithelial cells can be attributed to the activity of CCTα whereas PC synthesis of CHO-K1 cells may be the synergistic activity of both CCTα and CCTβ. To test the specificity of the CCT antibodies, we performed immunoblot analysis using homogenates ofSf9 insect cells that were transfected with rat CCTα (30Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and untransfected MLE-15 cells. All three CCT antibodies recognized proteins with molecular masses of ∼42 kDa (Fig.1b), similar to the molecular mass of rat CCTα (31Weinhold P.A. Rounsifer M.E. Feldman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5104-5110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first monitored the CCTα localization in CHO-K1 cells. The main purpose was to confirm the reported CCTα nuclear localization in these cells (14Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Wang Y. Sweitzer T.D. Weinhold P.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5899-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21DeLong C.J. Qin L. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32325-32330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A similar localization would validate our techniques. When CHO-K1 cells were either transfected with pCCTα-EGFP or pEGFP-CCTα⋅ for direct visualization, an extremely intense nuclear signal was observed (Fig. 2a, inset). When we increased the detector gain of the confocal microscope on these samples to levels similar to those used for the EGFP controls, a clear cytoplasmic signal was seen, although the resultant nuclear signal was saturated (Fig. 2a). Thus, although we observe a high nuclear signal in CHO-K1 cells, the localization of CCTα-EGFP and EGFP-CCTα appears not to be exclusively nuclear. Although some nuclear signal was noted with the pEGFPs without a CCTα⋅insert, they displayed a more generalized signal throughout the CHO-K1 cells when compared with pEGFPs with inserts (Fig. 2b). Indirect immunofluorescence was performed with both HA-CCTα and CCTα-FLAG constructs. In CHO-K1 cells, both CCTα fusion proteins co-localized with endogenous CCTα (Fig.3b). In contrast to the intense nuclear signal seen with EGFP-CCTα fusion proteins, FLAG- and HA-tagged CCTα⋅ distributed across the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 3b). This finding was corroborated by the indirect immunogold EM experiments. Immunogold label for CCTα in CHO-K1 cells was detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig.3a). The nuclear immunogold signal was weaker than that expected based on the CCTα-EGFP transfection experiments and previously published data (21DeLong C.J. Qin L. Cui Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32325-32330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). CCTα localized specifically to the nuclear envelope in proximity of the outer circumference (Fig.3a, arrowheads). There was no obvious preference for gold localization to hetrochromatin, euchromatin, or nuclear lamina. No gold particles were observed within the nucleolus region. Controls for all localization experiments included the omission of primary antibody and pre-immune serum treatment. When the primary anti-sera were omitted the occurrence of gold particles on sectioned material was very sparse (data not shown), suggesting that the gold-conjugated secondary antibody contributed little to the signal. The substitution of anti-serum for pre-immune serum resulted in the observation of only occasional gold particles (data not shown). There was not specific localization of these gold particles to any cellular compartment. Rather, the gold was close to evenly distributed over the cells and surrounding embedding material.Figure 3Indirect immunolocalization ofCCTα in cell lin"

Here, we use CD, NMR, and IR spectroscopy to study the conformation of the amino-terminal domain of histone H1°, free in solution and bound to the DNA. The NH2-terminal domain has little structure in aqueous solution, but it acquires a substantial amount of α-helical structure in the presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE). As in other H1 subtypes, the basic residues of the NH2-terminal domain of histone H1° are clustered in its COOH-terminal half. According to the NMR results, the helical region comprises the basic cluster (Lys11–Lys20) and extends until Asp23. The fractional helicity of this region in 90% TFE is about 50%. His24 together with Pro25constitute the joint between the NH2-terminal helix and helix I of the globular domain. Infrared spectroscopy shows that interaction with the DNA induces an amount of α-helical structure equivalent to that observed in TFE. As coulombic interactions are involved in complex formation, it is highly likely in the complexes with DNA that the minimal region with α-helical structure is that containing the basic cluster. In chromatin, the high positive charge density of the inducible NH2-terminal helical element may contribute to the binding stability of the globular domain.

In chromatin, the high positive charge density of the inducible NH2-terminal helical element may contribute to the binding stability of the globular domain. trifluoroethanol nuclear Overhauser effect nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy Fourier transform infrared The linker histone H1 has a role in the stabilization of both the nucleosome and chromatin higher order structure. Linker histones contain a globular domain flanked by highly basic amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails (1Hartman P.G. Chapman G.E. Moss T. Bradbury E.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The terminal domains have, in general, little structure in solution. The COOH-terminal domain acquires, however, a substantial amount of α-helix in the presence of secondary structure inducers such as TFE1 and NaClO4(2Clark D.J. Hill C.S. Martin S.R. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), suggesting that binding to DNA could stabilize helical segments in the COOH-terminal domain. It has been shown previously by FTIR spectroscopy that a COOH-terminal peptide of histone H1° becomes fully structured upon interaction with the DNA (3Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L.R. Suau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The structures of a turn and of a helix-turn motif belonging to the COOH-terminal domain have been determined by high resolution NMR in the presence of helix stabilizers (4Suzuki M. Gerstein M. Johnson T. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Vila R. Ponte I. Jiménez M.A. Rico M. Suau P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is currently accepted that H1 could have a regulatory role in transcription through the modulation of chromatin higher order structure. In vitro experiments with reconstituted chromatin have shown that H1 can repress promotors containing the RNA start site in the linker DNA, and that some sequence-specific transcription factors can counteract the H1-mediated repression. Preferential binding to scaffold-associated regions and participation in nucleosome positioning have been proposed as other possible mechanisms by which H1 could contribute to transcriptional regulation (6Zlatanova J. van Holde K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 889-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wolffe A.P. Khochbin P.S. Dimitrov S. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8Howe L. Itoh T.

The involvement of H1 in the 300-Å chromatin fiber, which presumably limits the access of the transcriptional machinery, led to the proposal that H1 subtypes may function as generalized repressors. More recently, experimentsin vivo have suggested that H1 may regulate transcription at a finer level, participating in complexes that either activate or repress specific genes (6Zlatanova J. van Holde K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 889-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Wolffe A.P. Khochbin P.S. Dimitrov S. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 10Khochbin S.

Some gene-specific effects could be attributed only to the globular domain (13Vermaak D. Steinbach O.C. Dimitrov S. Rupp R.A.W. Wolffe A.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 533-536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other effects were localized to the tail-like domains (14Lee H.L. Archer T.K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1454-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15Dou Y. Mizzen C.A. Abrams M. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 641-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The structure of the terminal domains of H1 when bound to the DNA is therefore of great importance to the understanding of H1 function. The NH2-terminal domain of H1° presents two distinct subregions, which are also found in other H1 subtypes (16Böhm L. Mitchel T.C. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The distal half is devoid of basic residues, whereas the half immediately adjacent to the globular domain is highly basic. The basic cluster is apparently involved in the location and anchoring of the globular domain (17Allan J. Mitchell T. Harborne N. Böhm L. Crane-Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We have used CD, high resolution NMR, and IR spectroscopy to study the structure of the NH2-terminal domain of the H1 subtype H1° in aqueous and TFE solution and in the complexes with the DNA. The NH2-terminal domain has little structure in aqueous solution, but in TFE it acquires a high degree of helical structure, predominantly in the region containing the basic cluster. We show that the interaction with the DNA induces a significant amount of α-helical structure in the NH2-terminal domain, similar to that observed in TFE. The peptides Ac-TENSTSAPAAKPKRAKASKK-NH2 (NH-1) and Ac-PAAKPKRAKASKKSTDHPKYSDM-NH2 (NH-2) were synthesized by standard methods (NH-1 by Neosystem Laboratoire (Strasbourg, France) and NH-2 by DiverDrugs (Barcelona, Spain)). Peptide homogeneity was determined by high performance liquid chromatography on Nucleosil C18 (NH-1) and Kromasil C8 (NH-2) columns. The peptide composition was confirmed by amino acid analysis, and the molecular mass was checked by mass spectrometry. The sequence of NH-1 corresponds to residues 1–20 and that of NH-2 to residues 8–30 of histone H1°. The sequence 1–30 is common to mouse and humans and presents two substitutions in rat, at positions 7 (Ala → Thr) and 18 (Ser → Ala). The peptides were acetylated and amidated during the synthesis process to remove the dipole destabilization effect. Samples for circular dichroism spectroscopy were 3.7 × 10−5msolutions of the peptide in 10 mm NaCl, 5 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 3.5. Samples in aqueous and mixed solvent with different ratios (v/v) of trifluoroethanol/H2O were prepared. Spectra were obtained on a Jasco J-715 CD spectrometer in 1-mm cells at 20 °C. The results are expressed as mean residue molar ellipticities, [θ]. The helical content was estimated from the ellipticity value at 222 nm, ([θ]222), according to the empirical equation of Chen et al. (18Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar).%helical content=100([Î¸]222/âˆ’39,500Ã—(1âˆ’2.57/n))Equation 1 n is the number of peptide bonds in the helix. The helical length was determined from the NMR data. Samples were routinely prepared as ∼2.7 mm solutions of the peptide in 90% deuterated TFE, 10% H2O, 5 mm phosphate buffer, 10 mm NaCl. The pH was adjusted to 3.5 with minimal amounts of HCl or NaOH in water. Sodium 3-trimethylsilyl (2,2,3,3-2H4) propionate was used as internal reference. Spectra were acquired in a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer. All two-dimensional spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase incrementation (19Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar) with presaturation of the water signal. Correlation spectroscopy (20Aue W.P. Bertholdi E. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1976; 64: 2229-2246Crossref Scopus (3100) Google Scholar) and NOESY (21Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2032) Google Scholar) spectra were obtained using standard phase-cycling sequences. Short mixing times of 150 ms were used in the NOESY experiments to avoid spin diffusion. Spectra were obtained at 25 °C. Total correlation spectroscopy spectra were acquired using the standard MLEV16 spin-lock sequence with a mixing time of 80 ms (22Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar). The phase-shift was optimized for every spectrum. The assignments of the 1H NMR spectra were performed by standard two-dimensional sequence-specific methods (23Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 715-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 24Wüthrich K. NMR of Protein and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Quantification of the helix populations on the basis of the up-field shifts of the CαH δ-values upon helix formation was carried out according to Jiménez et al. (25Jiménez M.A. Bruix M. González C. Blanco F.J. Nieto J.L. Herranz J. Rico M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The average helical population per residue was calculated by dividing the average conformational shift, Δδ = Σ(δ i obs − δ i RC)/n, by the shift corresponding to 100% helix formation. Random coil values, δRC, were those given by Wüthrich (24Wüthrich K. NMR of Protein and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). The random coil values used for Ala7, Lys11, and His24 were those given for amino acids followed by Pro (26Wishart D.S. Brigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). A value of −0.39 ppm was used as the shift for 100% helix formation (27Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 311-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). The helical length, n, was determined on the basis of NOE cross-peaks and conformational shifts and confirmed by structure calculations. Calculations of peptide structures were carried out with the program for torsion angle dynamics DYANA (28Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). Distance constraints were derived from the 150-ms NOESY spectrum acquired in 90% TFE at 25 °C, pH 3.5. The intensities of the observed NOEs were evaluated in a qualitative way and translated into upper limit distance constraints according to the following criteria; strong NOEs were set to distances lower than 0.3 nm; medium, lower than 0.35 nm, and weak, lower than 0.45 nm. Pseudo atom corrections were set to the sum of the van der Waals radii. φ angles were constrained to the range −180° to 0°. Peptide samples were measured at 4.6 mg/ml. Peptide-DNA complexes contained 6.7 mg/ml DNA and the appropriate amount of peptide. Samples were measured in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, plus either 10 or 70 mm NaCl. Data treatment and band decomposition of the original amide I′ have been described previously (3Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L.R. Suau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 29Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 367-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The DNA contribution to the spectra of the complexes of the NH-1 and NH-2 peptides with mouse DNA and alternating poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) was subtracted according to Vilaet al. (3Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L.R. Suau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, spectra of complexes of different peptide to DNA ratio (0.3 and 0.7, w/w) were recorded. The spectrum of the peptide was independent of the peptide to DNA ratio of the complex inside the statistical error, indicating that the amide I′ region was basically free of alterations resulting from DNA spectral changes. We have studied the peptides Ac-TENSTSAPAAKPKRAKASKK-NH2 (NH-1), which corresponds to the complete NH2-terminal domain of the histone H1 subtype H1° (residues 1–20) and the peptide Ac-PAAKPKRAKASKKSTDHPKYSDM-NH2 (NH-2), which partially overlaps with NH-1, but without the first 7 residues and which extends 10 residues into the adjacent globular domain (residues 8–29). The CD spectrum of both peptides in H2O was dominated by the contribution of the random coil. The mean residue molar ellipticity at 222 nm ([θ]222), taken as criterion of helix formation, was negligible in water. However, the small positive peak at 215 nm, characteristic of the random coil, was not observed, suggesting that a small amount of structure could be present in water (Fig.1). Addition of TFE, which stabilizes peptide secondary structure, increased the negative ellipticity at 222 nm. The helical content of the peptides as a function of TFE concentration was estimated by the method of Chen et al.(18Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). NH-2 had a higher helical propensity than NH-1. In 90% TFE solution, the helical populations were estimated to be 17% for NH-1 and 29% for NH-2 (Fig. 1). Fig.2 shows selected regions of the two-dimensional NOE spectrum of NH-2 in 90% TFE, where NOE correlations corresponding to medium-range interactions are indicated. Fig. 3 and TablesI and IIsummarize all relevant NOE data for the peptides in 90% TFE. The figure also shows the plot of the conformational shifts of the CαH protons with respect to the random coil values.Figure 3Sequence and summary of NOE connectivities observed in 90% TFE solution.

In NH-1, a stretch of αN(i, i + 3) connectivities spanned the basic cluster between Lys11 and Lys20. NOE connectivities αN(i, i + 3) between Pro12 and Lys16, αβ(i,i + 3) between Pro12 and Ala15, and αN(i, i + 4) between Lys11and Arg14 were also present. The calculation of the amount of helical structure based on the CαH chemical shifts gave a value of 17%. The negative values (∼−0.08) of CαHΔδ for the sequence Ala7–Ala9, together with an αN(i,i + 3) connectivity between Ala7 and Ala9 suggest that the peptide could have a slight helical propensity between Ala7 and the beginning of the basic cluster at Lys11. However, as shown below, the structures calculated on the basis of distance constraints derived from observed NOE cross-correlations had helical structure only in the second half of NH-1. Accordingly, we chose Lys11 and Lys19 as the limits of the helical region of NH-1. The higher helical propensity of NH-2 over NH-1 suggested that the helical element in NH-1 could extend beyond the limit of the NH2-terminal domain, as defined by trypsin cutting at Lys20. Indeed, in NH-2 stretches of αN(i,i + 3), αβ(i, i + 3), and αN(i, i + 4) NOE connectivities spanning from Lys11 to His24 were observed. The abundance of αN(i, i + 4) correlations between Lys11 to His24 unequivocally showed the presence of α-helical structure in this region. The CαHΔδ between Lys19 and His24were less negative than would be expected from the abundance of medium range cross-correlations in this region. This might be the result of the ring current shift effect produced by the histidine ring system, and precluded accurate calculation of the amount of helical structure of this peptide based on the CαH chemical shifts. The structure calculations were performed on the basis of the NOE cross-correlations observed in 90% TFE. A set of 42 distance constraints, composed of 25 sequential and 17 medium range constraints, was used to calculate the three-dimensional structure of NH-1. In NH-2, 53 distance constraints, 26 sequential and 27 medium range, were used. A number of 50 structures were generated for each peptide by using the distance geometry program DYANA (28Güntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (2558) Google Scholar). The best 20 converged structures were chosen for each peptide. The global RMS deviation of the backbone atoms for this set of structures, excluding the first and last residues, was 0.32 ± 0.09 nm for NH-1 and 0.23 ± 0.07 nm for NH-2. The maximum NOE violations were 0.05 and 0.02 nm for NH-1 and NH-2, respectively. A superposition of the backbones of the best 20 selected structures of each peptide is shown in Fig. 4. In NH-1, the region spanning from Lys11 to Lys19 adopts a well defined α-helical structure. In NH-2, the α-helical conformation spans from Lys11 to Asp23, with His24 as Ccap. His24presents an αN(i, i + 4) cross-correlation with Lys20, but its torsion φ (−31.7 ± 1.9) indicates that the α carbon departs slightly from the helix cylinder, whereas torsion ψ is proper of an extended configuration (ψ = +95.3 ± 0.1). Fig. 5 A shows a view down the helix axis of the helical region of one of the calculated structures of NH-2. The helix is clearly not amphipathic. However, a more careful consideration of the distribution of the basic residues shows that the first three, Lys11, Lys13, and Arg14, are clustered on one side of the helix, whereas the next three, Lys16, Lys19, and Lys20, are clustered on the other side (Fig.5 B). Some of the calculated structures show the folding in α-helical conformation of the sequence Lys26–Met30, which is part of the globular domain helix I (Fig.7 A). We have used FTIR spectroscopy to study the conformation of NH-1 and NH-2, both in solution and in the complexes with the DNA. IR spectroscopy is particularly well suited to the study of the complexes of DNA with basic peptides because is not affected by turbidity. The number and initial position of the amide I′ component bands were obtained by Fourier deconvolution as described (29Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 367-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Values corresponding to band position and percentage area are given in TablesIII andIV.Table IIIBand position (cm −1) and percentage area (%) corresponding to the assigned components obtained after curve fitting of the amide I′ band of the NH-1 peptide in aqueous (D 2 O) and TFE solution and in the complexes with the DNAAssignmentBand positionBand areaD2O90% TFENH1/mouse DNANH1/poly(dA-dT) · poly(dA-dT)cm −1%β-Structure1632001717Random1641–164242171820α-Helix1651–16536221818Turns1661–166329251717Turns1672–16747191615Turns1682–168521387 Open table in a new tab Table IVBand position (cm −1) and percentage area (%) corresponding to the assigned components obtained after curve fitting of the amide I′ band of the NH-2 peptide in aqueous (D 2 O) and TFE solution and in the complexes with the DNAAssignmentBand positionBand areaD2O90% TFENH2/mouse DNANH2/poly(dA-dT) · poly(dA-dT)cm −1%β-Structure1629–1630091418Random1640–164444251916α-Helix1651–16558322927Turns16632482017Turns1672–1674616109Turns1681–16843265 Open table in a new tab In aqueous (D2O) solution, the amide I′ of both NH-1 and NH-2 was dominated by the random coil band at 1641 cm−1(representing 42% of the total amide I′ intensity in NH-1 and 44% in NH-2) (30Byler O.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar). The other main component (29% of the total amide I′ intensity in NH-1 and 24% in NH-2) at 1661 cm−1 was assigned to turns. Minor components at 1674 cm−1 were also attributed to turns. Small amounts of α-helix at 1651 cm−1 were also present (6% in NH-1 and 8% in NH-2). The helical population increased considerably in TFE solution, both in NH-1 and NH-2. In NH-1, the α-helix amounted to 22% of the total amide I′ intensity, whereas, in NH-2, it amounted to 30%. These values are compatible with those estimated by CD. The random coil component decreased reciprocally with the increase of α-helix. In TFE, the turn components increased moderately in NH-1, whereas they remained approximately constant in NH-2. The relative intensities of the different turn components varied in the two peptides. We have studied the structure of NH-1 and NH-2 bound to mouse DNA and alternating poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) (Fig.6). In the peptide-DNA complexes, the α-helix (1651 cm−1) amounted to 18–20% of the total amide I′ intensity in NH-1 and 25–26% in NH-2. As the percentage of α-helix in aqueous solution was only 6–8%, these results indicate that interaction with the DNA stabilizes the helical structure of the peptides. The amounts of helical structure observed in the complexes with the DNA are similar to those observed in TFE solution, by both IR and CD. The contribution of the random coil band at 1641 cm−1 in the complexes was 17–20%, which is similar to that observed in TFE solution. Turn components were observed at 1662, 1672, and 1682 cm−1. They represented between 32 and 40%, depending on the peptide. The complexes of both peptides presented a component at 1630–32 cm−1, which amounted to 16–17% of the total amide I′ intensity. Vibrations at this wavenumber are usually attributed to β-sheets (31Arrondo J.L.R. Muga A. Castresana J. Goñi F.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 23-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar), although they have also been assigned to extended structures (30Byler O.M. Susi H. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 469-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (2739) Google Scholar) and even to α-helix vibrations (32Torii H. Tasumi M. J. Chem. Phys. 1992; 96: 3379-3387Crossref Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Subsequently, they were found in coiled coils and assigned to helix-helix contacts (33Reisdorf Jr., W.C. Krimm S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35 (1386): 1386Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The type of DNA does not appear to affect significantly the properties of the complexes, as the percentages and positions of the different components of the amide I′ were similar with poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) and mouse DNA. The NH2- and COOH-terminal domains of histone H1 have little structure in aqueous solution. However, the COOH-terminal domains of several H1 subtypes acquire variable amounts of α-helical structure in the presence of TFE and other secondary structure stabilizers (2Clark D.J. Hill C.S. Martin S.R. Thomas J.O. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The presence of a inducible helix-turn motif in the COOH-terminal domain of histone H1° has been demonstrated by NMR and FTIR spectroscopy (3Vila R. Ponte I. Collado M. Arrondo J.L.R. Suau P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Vila R. Ponte I. Jiménez M.A. Rico M. Suau P. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The structure of the NH2-terminal domain had not been addressed before, either in solution or in the complexes with the DNA. Here, we show that the interaction with the DNA induces a significant amount of α-helical structure in the NH2-terminal domain of H1°. The first half of the NH2-terminal domain of H1° is devoid of basic residues, and it is thus not expected to interact strongly with the DNA. In contrast, the second half of the domain is highly basic, with 1 Arg and 5 Lys residues. The proximity of this region to the globular domain suggests that it may contribute to the binding stability of the globular domain in chromatin. The clustering of the basic residues of the NH2-terminal domain in the vicinity of the globular domain, leaving the rest of the domain free of basic residues, is a common feature of H1 subtypes (16Böhm L. Mitchel T.C. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have studied two peptides: one comprising the 20 residues of the NH2-terminal domain (NH-1), as defined by trypsin cutting at Lys20, and the other of 23 residues, spanning 10 residues into the globular domain, and lacking the first 7 residues of the protein (NH-2). NH-1 and NH-2 have little structure in aqueous solution. The IR spectrum of both peptides is dominated by the random coil and to a lesser extend by turn conformations, probably in rapid equilibrium with the unfolded state. Small amounts of α-helix are also present. TFE induces a significant increase in the amount of α-helical structure in both peptides. NH-2 has a much higher helical propensity than NH-1, with 30% helical structure compared with the 18% of NH-1. When the amount of α-helix for the entire NH-2 peptide is corrected for the length of the helical region (13 residues), a fractional helicity of 57% is obtained. This relatively high helical propensity explains the abundance of medium range NOE cross-correlations in this region. The NMR analysis shows that the α-helix is induced in the positively charged second half of the NH2-terminal domain. In NH-1, the helical region spans from Lys11 to Arg19. In NH-2, the helical element also begins at Lys11, but it spans until Asp23, with His24 as Ccap, surpassing the limit of the globular domain as defined by trypsin cutting at Lys20. The NH2-terminal helix element is thus close to helix I of the globular domain, which starts at Lys26. The extension of the structural limit of the NH2-terminal domain beyond the proteolytic limit, together with the proximity of the NH2-terminal helical element to helix I, supports the view that the NH2-terminal basic cluster and the globular domain of histone H1 may act in concert in chromatin structure (17Allan J. Mitchell T. Harborne N. Böhm L. Crane-Robinson C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The proximity of the NH2-terminal basic cluster to the DNA at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome is supported by the cross-linking of His25 of histone H5, an avian H1 subtype closely related to H1° (34Doenecke D. Tönjes R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), to the terminal regions of chromatosomal DNA (35Mirzabekov A.D. Pruss D.V. Ebralidse K.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 B shows a model structure with the NH2-terminal domain of H1° connected to the globular domain of H5 (36Ramakrishnan V. Finch J.T. Graziano V. Lee P.L. Sweet R.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The distribution of the basic residues in the NH2-terminal helix is not amphipathic. However, the basic residues are distributed so that the first three basic residues are on one face of the helix and the next three on the other face. Basic residues are thus distributed in two clusters with opposite orientation. This arrangement, which is generated by helical compaction, seems suited to the cross-linking of nonconsecutive segments of DNA and could have a role in the organization of the nucleosomal or the linker DNA in chromatin. The question is whether the interaction with the DNA induces a significant increase in the helicity of the NH2-terminal peptides. IR spectroscopy shows that it is indeed the case. The percentages of α-helix of NH-1 and NH-2 in the complexes are 18–20% and 27–29%, respectively. These percentages are close to those observed in TFE solution and agree well with the different helical propensities of the two peptides. They reflect an important stabilization of the helical structure when compared with the low percentages present in water (6–7%) and demonstrate that the DNA displaces the coil (disordered)←→ helix equilibrium toward helix formation. As a low resolution technique, IR spectroscopy cannot, in general, specify which particular residues are in helical conformation, but, because coulombic interactions between basic residues and DNA phosphates promote helical compaction in model and natural peptides (3Vila R.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5193-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it is likely that the minimal region with helical structure in NH-2 is that containing the basic cluster, between Lys11 and Lys20, although, as in TFE, the helical structure could extend to Asp23. Significant as they are, the percentages of α-helix in the complexes are, nevertheless, indicative of the presence of alternative modes of binding. Indeed, if the helical elements as defined by NMR in TFE solution were always in a helical conformation in the complexes, the amount of α-helix should be ∼45% for NH-1 and about 56% for NH-2, instead of ∼20 and 30%, respectively. These other modes of binding could be at the origin of the component band at 1630 cm−1, and contribute to the components attributed to turns. A possible explanation of the observed values of fractional helicity would be that DNA can only partially mimic the nucleosome environment of the NH2-terminal domain."

In this study, the voltage-independent pathway was revealed by addition of naloxone and suramin to remove tonic blockade of Ca2+ currents via opioid and purinergic receptors due to autocrine feedback inhibition. This pathway requires the Ca2+-binding protein neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1). The voltage-dependent pathway was pertussis toxin-sensitive, whereas the voltage-independent pathway was largely pertussis toxin-insensitive. Characterization of the voltage-independent inhibition of Ca2+ currents revealed that it did not involve protein kinase C-dependent signaling pathways but did require the activity of a Src family tyrosine kinase. Two structurally distinct Src kinase inhibitors, 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d] pyrimidine (PP1) and a Src inhibitory peptide, increased the Ca2+ currents, and no further increase in Ca2+currents was elicited by addition of naloxone and suramin. In addition, the Src-like kinase appeared to act in the same pathway as NCS-1. In contrast, addition of PP1 did not prevent a voltage-dependent facilitation elicited by a strong pre-pulse depolarization indicating that this pathway was independent of Src kinase activity. PPI no longer increased Ca2+currents after addition of the P/Q-type channel blocker ω-agatoxin TK. The α1A subunit of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels was immunoprecipitated from chromaffin cell extracts and found to be phosphorylated in a PP1-sensitive manner by endogenous kinases in the immunoprecipitate. A high molecular mass (around 220 kDa) form of the α1A subunit was detected by anti-phosphotyrosine, suggesting a possible target for Src family kinase action. These data demonstrate a voltage-independent mechanism for autocrine inhibition of P/Q-type Ca2+ channel currents in chromaffin cells that requires Src family kinase activity and suggests that this may be a widely distributed pathway for Ca2+ channel regulation.

This includes inhibitory regulation via pathways involving G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 (1Hille B.

One of these, the voltage-dependent pathway, in which Ca2+ channel inhibition is reversed by strong depolarization, has been characterized in detail (4Ikeda S.R.

Nature. 1996; 380: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). In addition, many different but poorly characterized voltage-independent pathways for inhibition of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels have been studied in various neuronal cell types (1Hille B.

These pathways regulate steady-state current magnitude but not the activation kinetics of the channels. In some cases, multiple pathways co-exist in the same neurons (1Hille B.

In a second pathway, in rat sympathetic neurons, muscarinic receptor inhibition of Ca2+ channels (9Kammermeier P.J. Ruiz-Velasco V. Ikeda S.R. J.

A. 1991; 88: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and an unidentified diffusible messenger (13Bernheim L. Beech D.J. Hille B. Neuron. 1991; 6: 859-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In a third pathway, in chick dorsal root ganglion neurons, a voltage-independent regulation exists that requires the activity of an Src family tyrosine kinase (14Diverse-Pierluissi M. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. Dunlap K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5417-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the α1B subunit of the N-type channel in these cells has been shown to become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to γ-aminobutyric acid (15Schiff M.L. Sideroviski D.P. Jordan J.D. Brothers G. Snow B. Vries L.D. Ortiz D.F. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Nature. 2000; 408: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This Src kinase-mediated pathway has not been demonstrated to exist in any other cell type, or for regulation of other Ca2+ channel types, and so the extent of its distribution and general significance is unclear. We have been examining the physiological roles of neuronal calcium sensor-1 (NCS-1) protein, a member of a family of neuronally expressed EF hand Ca2+-binding proteins (16Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). NCS-1 and itsDrosophila orthologue, frequenin, have been shown to regulate Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in neurons (17Pongs O. Lindemeier J. Zhu X.R. Theil T. Endelkamp D. Krah-Jentgens I. Lambrecht H.-G. Koch K.W. Schwemer J. Rivosecchi R. Mallart A. Galceran J. Canal I. Barbas J.A. Ferrus A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30258-30265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). By using a dominant-negative mutant of NCS-1 (NCS-1(E120Q)), we have demonstrated a role for NCS-1 in an autocrine pathway for Ca2+ channel inhibition in adrenal chromaffin cells (20Weiss J.L. Archer D.A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40082-40087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Under our recording conditions, autocrine inhibition of non-L-type Ca2+ currents, due to activation of ATP and/or opioid receptors, occurred mostly through a voltage-independent pathway, and NCS-1 appeared to be required for this pathway, but expression of NCS-1(E120Q) did not interfere with prepulse facilitation. The existence of a voltage-independent pathway for Ca2+ channel regulation in chromaffin cells was also shown recently in another study (21Currie K.P.M. Fox A.P. J. Neurophysiol. 2000; 83: 1435-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), examining Ca2+ channel regulation by histamine. We determined the relationship between the NCS-1-dependent pathway for voltage-independent inhibition of non-L-type Ca2+ channels in chromaffin cells and those previously described in neurons for the regulation of N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. Our results indicate a requirement for Src family tyrosine kinase activity for this pathway acting on P/Q-type Ca2+ channels and that the α1A subunit of these channels is a substrate for Src family kinases. This is the first demonstration of a regulatory pathway for P/Q-type Ca2+channel inhibition involving Src family kinase activity. Tissue culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. A plasmid that encodes a fluorescent-enhanced mutant of green fluorescent protein (pEGFP) was obtained from CLONTECH (Basingstoke, UK), and the expression vector pcDNA3.1 (2Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar) was from Invitrogen (Leek, The Netherlands). 4-Amino-5-(4-methylphenyl) 7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP1) was from Alexis Corp., Nottingham, UK. Bisindolylmaleimide and the SrcKI peptide (pp60v-Src, residues 137–157) were from CN-Biosciences, Nottingham, UK. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), pertussis toxin (PTX), naloxone, ω-agatoxin TK, and all other reagents were from Sigma. Plasmids encoding NCS-1(E120Q) were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikchangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in pcDNA3.1 for transfection as described previously (20Weiss J.L. Archer D.A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40082-40087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated bovine adrenal chromaffin cells from adult cows (22Burgoyne R.D. Neuromethods. 1992; 20: 433-470Google Scholar) were plated directly onto collagen-coated 3.5-cm plastic Petri dishes for untransfected cell experiments or on non-tissue culture-treated 10-cm Petri dishes at a density of 1 × 106/ml for cells to be transfected the next day. The following day, cells in the non-tissue culture plates were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in growth medium at a density of 1 × 107/ml, and 20 μg of pEGFP (CLONTECH, Basingstoke, UK) in combination with 20 μg of either pDNA3.1 (control cells) or plasmid encoding NCS-1(E120Q) was added per ml of cells. Cells and plasmids were electroporated at 250 V and 975 microfarads for one pulse, using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II and 4-mm cuvettes. Cells were diluted as rapidly as possible to 1 × 106/ml with fresh growth media, and 1 × 106 cells were grown on 3.5-cm collagen-coated Petri dishes in a final volume of 3 ml of growth medium for a further 3–5 days. We have previously verified that GFP and NCS-1(E120Q) are efficiently co-expressed following transfection under these conditions (20Weiss J.L. Archer D.A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40082-40087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Adrenal chromaffin cells grown on 35-mm plastic dishes were washed and maintained in external bath solution containing 143 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm BaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. Where specifically indicated, some recordings were carried out in a similar buffer but containing 10 mm CaCl2 instead of 10 mm BaCl2 with or without the addition of 10 μm nicotine. The intracellular pipette solution contained 150 mm CsCl, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 2 mm1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 0.5 mm GTP, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3 (23Twitchell W.A. Rane S.G. Neuron. 1993; 10: 701-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The pipettes used had a resistance of 2.0–4.0 MΩ in the bath solution. Whole cell recording was carried out using an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). The cells were held at −80 mV after correction for a liquid junction potential of −8 mV and depolarized under the control of PULSE software (HEKA Electronics). Capacitance and series resistance were compensated using the EPC-9 correction routines. The average series resistance and cell capacitance for cells used in this study were 8.69 ± 0.42 MΩ (in all cases <15 MΩ) and 18.9 ± 0.82 picofarads, respectively (n = 74). The current output was filtered at 2.9 kHz with a 4-pole Bessel filter, and data were acquired and stored at 20-μs intervals. Linear leak and capacity currents were subtracted with a P/4 procedure using PULSE software, and traces are the averages of three sweeps. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–24 °C) without superfusion during recording. All reagent applications were by direct addition to the bath buffer or pipette as indicated in the text. Ca2+ channel currents were elicited by a step depolarization from the holding potential to 0 mV for 50 ms. To examine pre-pulse facilitation, a protocol was used in which an initial pre-pulse depolarization step to +90 mV for 50 ms was applied. After return to the holding potential of −80 mV for 15 ms, a test pulse to 0 mV for 50 ms was applied. Data are shown as mean ± S.E., and statistical differences were assessed using an unpaired Student's t test. Isolated chromaffin cells in culture were serum-starved for 24 h. The cells (107 cells per condition) were washed in Krebs buffer and then lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (24Evans G.J.O. Pocock J.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using anti-P/Q (α1A subunit of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels) antibodies (25Sakurai T. Hell J.W. Woppmann A. Miljanich G.P. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21234-21242Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) purchased from Sigma or anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY20, BD Transduction Laboratories). The immunoprecipitates were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the specified antibodies. The in vitro phosphorylation assays were performed on immunoprecipitates that were prepared as described above. All phosphorylation reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in Src kinase reaction buffer (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) with the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 3000 Ci/mmol, and 100 μmunlabeled ATP, in a total reaction volume of 40 μl with occasional gently mixing. The reactions were terminated by placing on ice and then washed twice with Src kinase reaction buffer plus 1% Triton X-100. The phosphorylated anti-P/Q immunoprecipitates were resolved by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gel was exposed to a phosphorscreen for 1 week. The phosphorscreen was imaged with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics). In this study, we generally recorded from adrenal chromaffin cells using a bath solution containing 10 mm Ba2+ and without perfusion of the cells. Under these conditions, Ba2+stimulates exocytosis from the chromaffin cells, and the release of endogenous secretory products leads to an autocrine inhibition of Ca2+ channel currents (26Albillos A. Gandia L. Michelena P. Gilabert J.A. del Valle M. Carbone E. Garcia A.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 687-695Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Currie K.P.M. Fox A.P.

Neuron. 1998; 20: 1255-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The inhibition can be fully relieved by application of both 100 μm suramin and 10 μm naloxone to block purinergic and opioid receptors, respectively (20Weiss J.L. Archer D.A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40082-40087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In these experiments, therefore, we examined the relief of tonic inhibition of Ca2+ currents (facilitation). Test pulses to 0 mV were used as these gave maximal activation of Ca2+ currents (20Weiss J.L. Archer D.A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40082-40087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Addition of naloxone and suramin to the bath (Fig. 1, A andB) resulted in an increase in steady-state Ca2+channel current with no change in activation kinetics as we have described previously (20Weiss J.L. Archer D.A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40082-40087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The facilitation due to naloxone and suramin developed slowly after addition of the antagonists to the bath reaching a stable peak after 3–5 min. Following this facilitation, due to maximal doses of naloxone and suramin, an additional increase in Ca2+ currents could still be elicited by a 50-ms pre-pulse depolarization to +90 mV which, in contrast to the effects of naloxone and suramin, modified the activation kinetics of the channels (Fig.1 B). The magnitude of the prepulse facilitation was unaffected by prior addition of naloxone and suramin (Fig.1 C) as expected if these are distinct mechanisms for facilitation. Voltage-dependent (prepulse) facilitation in chromaffin cells is pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive (26Albillos A. Gandia L. Michelena P. Gilabert J.A. del Valle M. Carbone E. Garcia A.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 687-695Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Doupnik C.A. Pun R.Y.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 140: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Cena V. Briocklehurst K.W. Pollard H.B. Rojas E. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 122: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We examined whether the voltage-independent inhibition mediated by purinergic and opioid receptors was PTX-sensitive by comparison with effects of PTX treatment on prepulse facilitation. Treatment for 24 h with 100 ng/ml PTX had no statistically significant effect on the magnitude of the Ca2+ channel currents (462.3 ± 97.9 pA for control and 537 ± 68.8 pA for PTX-treated cells). In addition, PTX treatment had no effect on the facilitation due to naloxone and suramin addition but largely abolished the prepulse facilitation in the same cells (Fig. 2, A andB). From a series of cells, the facilitation due to naloxone and suramin was not statistically significantly affected by PTX treatment (Fig. 2 C), whereas prepulse facilitation was significantly reduced by around 80% (Fig. 2 D). The effect of PTX treatment on prepulse facilitation could not be explained by an inhibition of secretion of autocrine factors as PTX treatment leads instead to an enhancement of evoked exocytosis in chromaffin cells (31Burgoyne R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 174-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar,32O'Sullivan A.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biosci. Rep. 1989; 9: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with studies on other systems where voltage-independent regulation of Ca2+ channels is usually PTX-insensitive (1Hille B. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 12: 531-536Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (672) Google Scholar). In addition, they provide further evidence for the distinct nature of the pathways of voltage-dependent and voltage-independent inhibition of Ca2+ currents in chromaffin cells under our recording conditions. To confirm that the inhibition of Ca2+ channels seen in the presence of Ba2+ could also be observed under more physiological conditions with other secretagogues, we carried out a series of experiments using Ca2+ rather than Ba2+ as the charge carrier in the bath buffer. Secretion, in these experiments, was triggered by activation of nicotinic cholinergic receptors. In the presence of 10 μm nicotine (4 of 4 cells), addition of naloxone and suramin again resulted in a facilitation of Ca2+ currents (Fig. 2 E) showing that tonic inhibition of Ca2+ channel currents also occurred under these conditions. In some cells (4/5), a smaller facilitation was also observed in the presence of external Ca2+ in the absence of secretagogue indicating that accumulation of secretory products due to basal secretion can be sufficient to give some autocrine inhibition of Ca2+channels under these conditions. As expected, addition of ATP or met-enkephalin did not produce any further facilitation in the presence of secretagogues. Channel facilitation was not entirely dependent on the use of suramin as in 3 of 3 cells facilitation was detected following addition of only naloxone (Fig. 2 F). Nevertheless, to ensure complete relief of autocrine inhibition, a mixture of both opioid and purinergic antagonists was used in later experiments. We have shown previously (20Weiss J.L. Archer D.A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol.

The yeast orthologue of NCS-1 (33Hendricks K.B. Wang B.Q. Schnieders E.A. Thorner J. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) is an activator of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, an important enzyme in the pathway leading to synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, raising the possibility that expression of the NCS-1 mutant may have disrupted phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate biosynthesis and thereby receptor signaling to PKC. To test this possibility, the effect of 100 nm PMA on cells transfected with NCS-1(E120Q) was examined to see if direct PKC activation would inhibit the Ca2+ currents. PMA had little or no effect on Ca2+ currents (Fig.3 A) in these cells (5 of 5 cells). The converse experiment of examining whether inhibition of PKC would relieve the autocrine inhibition in non-transfected cells revealed that addition of the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide had little effect on Ca2+ currents (Fig. 3 B). We also examined the effect of PMA treatment after relief of autocrine inhibition by naloxone and suramin addition (Fig. 3 C). These experiments were carried out in the presence of 3 μmnifedipine to rule out any confounding effects of PMA on L-type Ca2+ currents. Under these conditions we did not observe any inhibition of Ca2+ current following PMA treatment (5 of 5 cells). These data suggest that neither the effect of NCS-1(E120Q) expression nor the naloxone/suramin voltage-independent facilitation involves inactivation of a PKC-dependent pathway. Voltage-independent inhibition by γ-aminobutyric acid of N-type Ca2+ channels in chick sensory neurons requires the activity of a Src family tyrosine kinase (14Diverse-Pierluissi M. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. Dunlap K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5417-5421Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The involvement of tyrosine kinase activity for GPCR-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ channels has not been demonstrated so far in any other cell types. We examined whether such a requirement exists in adrenal chromaffin cells. Addition to the bath of PP1 (5 μm), an inhibitor of Src family kinases (34Hanke J.H. Garnder J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), produced a marked facilitation of the Ca2+ current (Fig.4 A) that developed slowly over 3–5 min. The facilitation due to PP1 varied in magnitude between batches of cells but was observed in all cells examined (27/27) with a mean increase in current amplitude of 343.9 ± 64.6 pA. The effect of PP1 was due to facilitation of non-L-type Ca2+ channels as the stimulation by PP1 was preserved and occurred to a similar extent (Fig. 4 B) in the presence of the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nifedipine (3 μm). Addition of PP1 also increased Ca2+ current inhibited due to the presence of the secretagogue 10 μm nicotine in the presence of external Ca2+ rather than Ba2+(data not shown). To examine the relationship between the voltage-dependent pathway, the voltage-independent pathway, and the facilitation due to Src kinase inhibition, two experiments were carried out. In the first (Fig. 4 C), two populations of cells were examined. Control cells were treated with naloxone and suramin to determine the extent of facilitation by the voltage-independent pathway. In parallel, a separate population of cells was first treated with PP1 to inhibit Src family kinases. Facilitation was achieved in all 4 cells, and subsequently, naloxone and suramin were added. The prior addition of PP1 significantly reduced the facilitation due to naloxone and suramin by around 75%. In the second experiment (Fig. 4 D), the extent of prepulse facilitation in each cell was first determined, and then PP1 was added leading to a prolonged facilitation due to the inhibitor. Following the facilitation by PP1, which occurred in all 9 cells, the pre-pulse protocol was repeated. Prior addition of PP1 did not lead to any significant change in the extent of prepulse facilitation. These data suggest an involvement of a Src family activity kinase in the voltage-independent inhibition of Ca2+ currents in chromaffin cells but not in the voltage-dependent pathway. We have demonstrated previously (20Weiss J.L. Archer D.A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40082-40087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that the voltage-independent but not the voltage-dependent inhibitory pathway in chromaffin cells is disrupted by expression of NCS-1(E120Q), a dominant-negative mutant of NCS-1. The preceding results, suggesting a role for a Src kinase in the voltage-independent pathway, predict that the facilitation due to inhibition of Src kinase activity should be disrupted by NCS-1(E120Q) expression. To test this prediction, chromaffin cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding GFP and NCS-1(E120Q), and the effect of PP1 was examined on transfected and untransfected cells in parallel. In these experiments, PP1 again produced a marked increase in Ca2+ currents in all 7 untransfected cells examined (Fig.5 A). In contrast, in NCS-1(E120Q)-transfected cells, the PP1 facilitation was significantly reduced by around 75% compared with the control untransfected cells (Fig. 5, B and C). These data are consistent with NCS-1 acting on the same voltage-independent pathway as the Src family tyrosine kinase. To confirm the involvement of an Src-like tyrosine kinase, a structurally unrelated inhibitor was used that was applied to the cells by an alternative route in the pipette buffer. The peptide derived from amino acids 137–157 of the regulatory domain of pp60v-Src (SrcKI) is a well characterized and specific inhibitor of Src family kinases (35Sato K. Miki S. Tachibana H. Hayashi F. Akiyama T. Fukami Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 1151-1159Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Fukami Y. Sato K. Ikeda K. Kamisango K. Koizumi K. Matsuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1132-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, Ca2+ currents were monitored every minute after the establishment of the whole cell recording. When the inhibitory peptide (SrcKI) was included in the pipette buffer at a concentration of 70 μm, Ca2+ current increased over time during whole cell recording and reached a stable maximum after 5 min of intracellular dialysis (Fig.6 A). In parallel recordings in which control cells, without peptide in the pipette, were monitored, there was some increase in Ca2+ current over this period, but the increase was"

In S phase, CDP/Cux was shown to interact with and repress the core promoter of the p21 WAF1 gene. Here we demonstrate that DNA binding by p110 CDP/Cux is down-modulated as cells progress into G2. Accordingly, cyclin A-Cdk1 was found to bind to CDP/Cux and modulate its DNA binding activity in vitro and in vivo. Interaction with CDP/Cux required the presence of both cyclin A and a cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-activating kinase-activated Cdk1 and involved the Cut homeodomain and a downstream Cy motif. Phosphorylation of serines 1237 and 1270 caused inhibition of DNA binding in vitro. In cotransfection studies, cyclin A-Cdk1 inhibited CDP/Cux stable DNA binding and prevented repression of the p21 WAF1 reporter. In contrast, mutant CDP/Cux proteins in which serines 1237 and 1270 were replaced with alanines were not affected by cyclin A-Cdk1. In summary, our results suggest that the phosphorylation of CDP/Cux by cyclin A-Cdk1 contributes to down-modulate CDP/Cux activity as cells progress into the G2 phase of the cell cycle.

Gene. 2001; 270: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The first member of the family to be discovered was the Drosophila melanogaster Cut protein. Several lethal and viable mutations within the cut locus have been reported to mediate phenotypic effects in tissues as diverse as the femur, wing margin, embryonic sensory organs, malpighian tubules, trachea, and some structures in the central nervous system (2Bodmer R.

One mutation preventing the function of a distant wing-specific enhancer caused the formation of truncated or cut wings (5Jack J. Dorsett D. Delotto Y. Liu S.

This is the phenotype that gave its name to the locus cut.In vertebrates, the CCAAT-displacement activity was first characterized in sea urchin, early B cells, and myeloid precursor cells (7Barberis A. Superti-Furga G. Busslinger M. Cell. 1987; 50: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 8Skalnik D.G. Strauss E.C. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16736-16744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of this activity from HeLa cells and subsequent cloning of the corresponding cDNA revealed that the CCAAT displacement protein, CDP, was the human ortholog of Cut (9Neufeld E.J. Skalnik D.G. Lievens P.M. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 10Blochlinger K. Bodmer R. Jack J. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1988; 333: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Other cDNAs have been isolated from other species. In particular, the mouse cDNA was called Cux (Cut homeobox) in accordance with the nomenclature rules (11Valarche I. Tissier-Seta J.P. Hirsch M.R. Martinez S. Goridis C. Brunet J.F. Development. 1993; 119: 881-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The term CDP/Cux will be used in the remainder of this manuscript to designate the mammalian protein.Several reports have described CDP/Cux as playing a role in precursor cells as a transcriptional repressor that down-modulates genes which later become expressed in terminally differentiated cells (8Skalnik D.G.

This function was ascribed to the ability of CDP/Cux to prevent the interaction of various transcriptional activators with their binding sites (16Luo W. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18203-18210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). DNA binding studies using recombinant fusion proteins suggested that this “CCAAT displacement activity” was carried out by the combined action of Cut repeats 1 and 2, which exhibit rapid but transient binding to DNA sequences containing two half-sites loosely conforming to the CGAT or CAAT consensus positioned in either orientation and at various distances from each other (17Moon N.S. Berube G. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31325-31334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Apart from this transient DNA binding activity, Cut repeat 3 and the Cut homeodomain can cooperate to allow stable interaction with DNA sequences resembling the ATCGAT consensus (18Harada R. Dufort D. Denis-Larose C. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2062-2067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Harada R. Berube G. Tamplin O.J. Denis-Larose C. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell.

Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7757-7761Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of the protein was shown to contain two active repression domains that can recruit histone deacetylase activity (22Mailly F. Berube G. Harada R. Mao P.L. Phillips S. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5346-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,23Li S. Moy L. Pittman N. Shue G. Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. LeLeiko N.S. Walsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7803-7815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, CDP/Cux can repress gene expression by two mechanisms, competition for binding site occupancy and active repression.Other studies report that CDP/Cux represses gene expression in immature B and T cells via its binding to AT-rich sequences within matrix-attachment regions (24Banan M. Rojas I.C. Lee W.H. King H.L. Harriss J.V. Kobayashi R. Webb C.F. Gottlieb P.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5275-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of repression is still a matter of debate but could involve competition with activators and/or the recruitment of a chromosomal locus to a distinct nuclear compartment.A role for CDP/Cux in cell cycle progression has been inferred from a number of reports. CDP/Cux was found to be a component of the histone nuclear factor D (HiNF-D), whose presence on various histone promoters coincides with its up-regulation in the cell cycle (28van Wijnen A.J. van Gurp M.F. de Ridder M.C.

Physiol. 1994; 159: 515-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Interaction of CDP/Cux with a consensus binding site or with histone H4 gene promoter sequences (as part of HiNF-D) was found to be up-regulated as cells progress from G1 to S phase (32Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Holthuis J. Owen T.A. van Wijnen A.J. Wright K.L. Ramsey-Ewing A. Kennedy M.B. Carter R. Cosenza S.C. Soprano K.J. Lian J.B. Science. 1990; 247: 1454-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). CDP/Cux was shown to bind to the core promoter of the p21 WAF1/CIP1 gene, and in transient transfection assays, CDP/Cux repressed a p21 WAF1/CIP1 reporter, whereas an antisense CDP/Cux construct was able to restore p21 WAF1/CIP1 expression levels in S phase (32Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). An increase in DNA binding at the G1/S transition involved two regulatory events, dephosphorylation of the Cut homeodomain by the Cdc25A phosphatase and specific proteolytic cleavage of CDP/Cux between CR1 and CR2 to generate an amino-terminal-truncated protein of 110 kDa (32Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 34Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Cell cycle progression is controlled by a series of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), phosphatases, and Cdk inhibitors. Each phase of the cell cycle and the transition between any two phases is controlled by certain cyclin-Cdk complexes whose activation requires several steps (reviewed in Ref. 35Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar). First, association of a Cdk with a specific cyclin confers a certain level of activation as well as specificity. Secondly, Cdk activity is modulated by the state of phosphorylation of specific residues. Kinase activity is further increased by the action of the Cdk-activating kinase (CAK), comprised of Cdk7 and cyclin H, which phosphorylates a threonine residue in the T loop. Finally, for some Cdks, full activity requires dephosphorylation of Tyr-14 and Thr-15 by one of the Cdc25 phosphatases. Checkpoint control, a process by which cell cycle progression is blocked in response to defects in DNA, is implemented by the phosphorylation of Cdc25 phosphatases by the Chk1 and Myt1 kinases (36Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar, 37Blasina A. Van de Weyer I. Laus M.C. Luyten W. Parker A.E. McGowan C.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Finally, association with various Cdk inhibitors can either down-modulate or stimulate Cdk function depending on the Cdk inhibitor and the relative amount of it (38Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 39Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). For example, p21 WAF1/CIP1 can stimulate cyclin D-Cdk4 activity at low stoichiometric amounts but repress it at higher concentrations (40LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar).Although the mechanisms of Cdk regulation have been deciphered to some extent, less is known about the targets of cyclin-Cdks and their functions. Only a few targets have been identified, and for most cyclin-Cdks we still do not know what targets are necessary and sufficient for progression into the next phase of the cell cycle. For example, G1 Cdks, the cyclin D-Cdk4 and -6 and cyclin E-Cdk2, have been shown to phosphorylate Rb, triggering its release from the E2F transcription factor (41Kato J. Matsushime H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 42Dynlacht B.D. Flores O. Lees J.A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1772-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Yet, cyclin E was also found to induce the G1/S transition in an Rb-independent manner, suggesting that at least one other target is essential for progression into S phase (43Lukas J. Herzinger T. Hansen K. Moroni M.C. Resnitzky D. Helin K. Reed S.I. Bartek J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1479-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the transition between the S and G2 phases. One Cdk complex that is not as well known is the cyclin A-Cdk1 complex. Association with cyclin A was shown to require prior phosphorylation by CAK (44Desai D. Wessling H.C. Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Monitoring the activity of this complex involves immunoprecipitation with either anti-cyclin A or anti-Cdk1 antibodies. In the former case, one measures the combined activities of cyclin A-Cdk2 and Cdk1 complexes; in the latter case, one measures cyclin A-Cdk1 and cyclin B-Cdk1. Despite these caveats, the combined results suggest that cyclin A-Cdk1 is first detected in S phase and increases moderately until prophase (45Pines J. Hunter T. Nature. 1990; 346: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 46Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). So far, only a few substrates of cyclin A-Cdk1 have been characterized. Phosphorylation of the Cdc25B phosphatase by cyclin A-Cdk1 was shown to target Cdc25B for proteosome-dependent degradation (47Baldin V. Cans C. Knibiehler M. Ducommun B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32731-32734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of p53 by cyclin A-Cdk1 and Cdk2 on serine 315 was shown not only to stimulate DNA binding activity but also to modify its specificity (48Luciani M.G. Hutchins J.R. Zheleva D. Hupp T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 503-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Previous studies aimed at identifying substrate recognition sequences for cyclin-Cdk complexes have revealed a number of interaction motifs. Cyclin binding motifs, called Cy, were identified within p21, p27, pRB, p107, p130, E2F-1, Cdc25A, CDC6, Myt1, and p53 (49Adams P.D. Sellers W.R. Sharma S.K. Wu A.D. Nalin C.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Mol.

A ZRXL sequence is present in p21, p107, p130, and Cdc25A, whereas both pRb and p53 contain a KKL sequence. Peptides containing a Cy motif were shown to inhibit interaction between the substrate and the cyclinD-Cdk4, cyclinE-Cdk2, or cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes. Further studies revealed that the Cy sequence interacts with a hydrophobic patch containing the MRAIL sequence on the surface of cyclin A and reduces theK m (peptide) ∼75–120-fold (60Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 61Russo A.A. Jeffrey P.D. Patten A.K. Massague J. Pavletich N.P.

Apart from this docking site, the phospho-acceptor serine was also shown to contribute to the interaction (62Takeda D.Y. Wohlschlegel J.A. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Altogether, results from these studies suggest that the Cy motif and the phospho-acceptor site constitute a bipartite substrate recognition sequence for certain cyclin-dependent kinases. However, targeting of other substrates or other phosphorylation sites within the same substrate appear to involve different interaction motifs. For example, whereas most Cdk phosphorylation sites within pRb displayed a strict dependence on the presence of the Cy motif for their phosphorylation, at least one phospho-acceptor site could be efficiently phosphorylated in the absence of the Cy motif, implying that other mechanisms can serve to target a cyclin-Cdk to a specific substrate (50Adams P.D.

In agreement with this, a Cdk2 binding domain was mapped between residues 45 and 60 of p21 WAF1/CIP1, a region that is fully conserved in the p27Kip1 inhibitor (63Goubin F. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2281-2287PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a distinct Cdk1 binding domain was identified within the carboxyl-terminal domain of p53 (48Luciani M.G. Hutchins J.R. Zheleva D. Hupp T.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 503-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 64Wagner P. Fuchs A. Gotz C. Nastainczyk W. Montenarh M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).We have previously shown that CDP/Cux DNA binding activity fluctuates in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of serine residues in a region of CDP/Cux encompassing the Cut homeodomain correlated with reduced DNA binding in G1, whereas increased DNA binding in S phase coincided with dephosphorylation of the same region (32Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated CDP/Cux activity later in the cell cycle. We found that DNA binding by CDP/Cux decreases as cells progress from S to G2. We showed that activated cyclin A-Cdk1 can interact with CDP/Cux in vitro, phosphorylate it on two serines around the Cut homeodomain, and inhibit its DNA binding activity. Overexpression of cyclin A-Cdk1 inhibited of DNA binding by the wild type protein but not by a mutant CDP/Cux protein in which serines 1237 and 1270 were replaced with alanine. These results suggest that CDP/Cux is a physiological target of cyclin A-Cdk1 and that down-modulation of CDP/Cux activity is important for cell cycle progression in late S and in G2.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that cyclin A-Cdk1 can associate with CDP/Cuxin vitro, phosphorylate it on serines 1237 and 1270 and inhibit its DNA binding activity (Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). In cells, overexpression of cyclin A-Cdk1 inhibited CDP/Cux DNA binding and repression activities, whereas a mutant CDP/Cux protein in which serines 1237 and 1270 were replaced with alanine was not affected by cyclin A-Cdk1. These results are in accordance with the findings that CDP/Cux DNA binding activity decreases in G2, the phase of the cell cycle when the cyclin A-Cdk1 complex becomes prominent. Altogether these results strongly suggest that CDP/Cux is a target of cyclin A-Cdk1 and that progression through S and G2 in the cell cycle is facilitated by the down-modulation of CDP/Cux activity.We have previously shown that CDP/Cux DNA binding activity is up-regulated at the G1/S transition as a result of dephosphorylation by the Cdc25A phosphatase (32Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). More recently, we discovered that the up-regulation of stable CDP/Cux DNA binding activity involves specific proteolytic cleavage of the full-length protein to generate an amino-truncated isoform of 110 kDa (34Moon N.S. Premdas P. Truscott M. Leduy L. Berube G. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6332-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Importantly, the proteolytic processing of CDP/Cux was found to take place preferentially in populations of cells that were synchronized in S phase. In the present study, we demonstrated that CDP/Cux DNA binding activity is down-modulated as cells progress in G2. Altogether, these results point to a specific role of CDP/Cux in S phase or at the G1/S transition. Because CDP/Cux functions as a transcription factor, we can speculate that it regulates the expression of genes whose products play a role in the control of DNA replication. A systematic analysis of CDP/Cux target genes will be necessary to understand its role in cell cycle progression. However, a few potential targets have already been identified and will be discussed here.CDP/Cux was shown to bind to the core promoter of the p21 WAF1/CIP1 gene and repress its expression (32Coqueret O. Berube G. Nepveu A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4680-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a reporter construct containing the p21 promoter was shown to be down-regulated in S phase, and co-expression of a CDP/Cux antisense transcript restored expression of the reporter to the level seen in G1. The relevance of these observations is hard to assess in light of the fact that p21 protein expression, unlike its transcription, was not found to decrease in S phase. It can be argued that although the steady-state level of p21 may remain stable in G1 and S phases, there is an important difference between a dynamic system where there is active synthesis and degradation of the protein and a static system where there is no synthesis and no degradation. In the dynamic system, there is an influx of protein that can associate with new partners, whereas in the static system we can envisage that the protein remains sequestered within the same complexes, thereby allowing newly synthesized cyclin-Cdk complexes to assemble without p21. In this line of thinking, one role of CDP/Cux may be to prevent de novo synthesis of p21 in S phase. Other potential targets of CDP/Cux are some of the histone genes. Several studies have described the S phase-specific association of CDP/Cux as part of the HiNF-D complex with the promoter of histone H4 genes (28van Wijnen A.J. van Gurp M.F. de Ridder M.C. Tufarelli C. Last T.J. Birnbaum M. Vaughan P.S. Giordano A. Krek W. Neufeld E.J. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11516-11521Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar,29van Wijnen A.J. Wright K.L. Lian J.B. Stein J.L. Stein G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15034-15042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coincidence between the up-regulation of histone H4 genes and the presence of the HiNF-D complex on their promoters raised the possibility that CDP/Cux can play a role as an activator at least in the context of the HiNF-D complex. Interestingly the association of cyclin A and Cdk1 with HiNF-D was revealed from gel shift immunoassays at a time when it was not yet known that CDP/Cux was the DNA binding partner within this complex (73van Wijnen A.J. Aziz F. Grana X. De Luca A. Desai R.K. Jaarsveld K. Last T.J. Soprano K. Giordano A. Lian J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12882-12886Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In this framework, we speculate that the association with cyclin A-Cdk1 would serve to down-modulate the activity of HiNF-D once DNA and histone synthesis has taken place.Our binding assays indicated that the interaction with CDP/Cux required both cyclin A and a Cdk (Fig. 3). On one hand, Cdk1 bound to CDP/Cux only in the presence of cyclin A and after activation by CAK (Fig. 3). The role of CAK could be to allow the formation of the cyclin A-Cdk1 complex, since it was not itself co-immunoprecipitated with CDP/Cux. Indeed, cyclin A and Cdk1 were shown to form a high affinity complex only after CAK-mediated phosphorylation of Cdk1 (44Desai D. Wessling H.C. Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). On the other hand, CDP/Cux bound to cyclin A and Cdk2 but not to cyclin A alone (Fig. 3 B). The requirement for both cyclin A and a Cdk could merely reflect the fact that these proteins change conformation upon binding to each other. However, the fact that two regions of CDP/Cux were also needed for the interaction supports the notion that cooperative binding was at play. In pull-down assays the CTD was not sufficient for efficient interaction (Fig. 3 C). It could only weakly bring down cyclin A. In contrast, a recombinant protein containing both the Cut homeodomain and the Cy sequence brought down both cyclin A and Cdk1 or Cdk2 efficiently. Removal of the Cy sequence prevented the interaction. Moreover, in the in vitro kinase assay, removal of the Cy sequence reduced the efficiency of phosphorylation by approximately 3-fold (Fig. 4 B). Yet cyclin A-Cdk1 was still able to phosphorylate a CR3HD fusion protein in which the Cy sequence had been removed. In accordance with this result, in cotransfection assays the removal of the Cy sequence from the recombinant CDP/Cux protein diminished but did not abolish the effect of cyclin A-Cdk1 on the activity of CDP/Cux. Regarding the latter two experiments, it should be stressed that the proteins involved were present at high concentrations. It is likely that at physiological levels the modulation of CDP/Cux by cyclin A-Cdk1 requires cooperative interactions between cyclin A and the Cy motif and between Cdk1 and the Cut homeodomain.Phosphorylation has been shown to have a profound impact on protein functions. Only two other proteins have been shown to be the target of modulation by cyclin A-Cdk1: Cdc25B and p53. Phosphorylation of Cdc25B induces its degradation by the proteosome, whereas phosphorylation of p53 stimulates its DNA binding activity and modulates its specificity. In the case of CDP/Cux, phosphorylation by cyclin A-Cdk1 inhibits its DNA binding activity. As for the substrates of other kinases, the effect of phosphorylation by cyclin A-Cdk1 depends essentially on the position of the phospho-acceptor site within the substrate. We would predict that a myriad of molecular consequences will be discovered as more targets of cyclin A-Cdk1 are identified. At the cellular level, the results of the present study and those of previous reports describing the activation of CDP/Cux at the G1/S transition suggest that the phosphorylation of CDP/Cux by cyclin A-Cdk1 serves to down-modulate an activity that is re"

We have therefore investigated the presence of different types of IP3R in the secretory granules of bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells using immunogold electron microscopy and found the existence of all three types of IP3R in the secretory granules. To determine whether these IP3Rs interact with CGA and CGB, each IP3R isoform was co-transfected with CGA or CGB into NIH3T3 or COS-7 cells, and the expressed IP3R isoform and CGA or CGB were co-immunoprecipitated. From these studies it was shown that all three types of IP3R form complexes with CGA and CGB in the cells. To further confirm whether the IP3R isoforms and CGA and CGB form a complex in the secretory granules the potential interaction between all three isoforms of IP3R and CGA and CGB was tested by co-immunoprecipitation experiements of the mixture of secretory granule lysates and the granule membrane proteins. The three isoforms of IP3R were shown to form complexes with CGA and CGB, indicating the complex formation between the three isoforms of IP3R and CGA and CGB in the secretory granules. Moreover, the pH-dependent Ca2+ binding property of CGB was also studied using purified recombinant CGB, and it was shown that CGB bound 93 mol of Ca2+/mol with a dissociation constant (K d) of 1.5 mm at pH 5.5 but virtually no Ca2+ at pH 7.5. The high capacity, low affinity Ca2+-binding property of CGB at pH 5.5 is comparable with that of CGA and is in line with its role as a Ca2+ storage protein in the secretory granules.

The secretory granule contents are secreted to the extracellular space and then into the bloodstream during exocytosis, which is initiated by a sudden increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration (7Chen Y.A.

In bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells the secretory granules occupy ∼10% of the total cell volume (8Nordmann J.J. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), thereby storing a majority of the intracellular Ca2+ of the cell in the secretory granules. Hence it appears inevitable for the secretory granules to participate in the control of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations.Consistent with this notion, the secretory granules from adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (9Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13446-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pancreatic acinar cells (10Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H.

Chin W.-C. Verdugo P. Nature. 1998; 395: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Moreover, granular Ca2+ was shown to participate in the initiation of exocytosis (12Maruyama Y. Inooka G.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since then the existence of type 3 IP3R (IP3R-3) in the insulin-containing secretory granules of pancreatic β-cells had been reported (17Blondel O. Moody M.M. Depaoli A.M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Swift H. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Halban P.A. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2745-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the existence of IP3R/Ca2+ channels in the secretory granules of insulin-containing pancreatic β-cells (19Srivastava M. Atwater I. Glasman M. Leighton X. Goping G. Caohuy H. Miller G.

The IP3 concentration dependence of Ca2+ release of these three types has been shown to be in the order of IP3R-2>IP3R-1>IP3R-3, the type 2 being the most active and type 3 being the least active (27Miyakawa T.

Such low concentrations of intragranular free Ca2+ have also been found in mouse pancreatic acinar cell (10Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H.

Further, CGA is known to bind 55 mol of Ca2+/mol with a K d of 4 mm at the intragranular pH 5.5 and 32 mol of Ca2+/mol with a dissociation constant (K d) of 2.7 mm at a near physiological pH 7.5 (37Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7740-7745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high capacity, low affinity Ca2+ binding property of CGA has been proposed to be responsible for the IP3-sensitive Ca2+ store role of secretory granules of bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (9Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13446-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7740-7745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have previously demonstrated direct interaction between the IP3R-1 and CGA and CGB using purified IP3R-1 (20Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, coupling of CGA and CGB with the IP3R-1 was shown to enhance the IP3-induced Ca2+release through the IP3R-1/Ca2+ channel reconstituted in the liposomes (38Yoo S.H. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15067-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In addition, the open probability and mean open time of the IP3R-1/Ca2+ channel were also shown to increase in the lipid bilayer as a result of coupled CGA (39Thrower E.C. Park H.Y. Yoo S.H. Ehrlich B. Biophys. J. 2001; 80 (.a): 455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have therefore investigated in the present study the identity of IP3R types that are present in the secretory granules and the pH-dependent Ca2+-binding property of CGB. Moreover, the potential interaction between each IP3R type and the secretory granule Ca2+storage proteins chromogranins A and B was also studied.DISCUSSIONSince the demonstration that the secretory granules of adrenal medullary chromaffin cells release Ca2+ in response to IP3 (9Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13446-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the IP3-sensitive Ca2+store role of secretory granules has also been shown in other secretory cells (10Gerasimenko O.V.

Nature. 1998; 395: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The presence of IP3R on the secretory granule membrane has been shown in adrenal chromaffin cells (16Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and pancreatic β-cells (19Srivastava M. Atwater I. Glasman M. Leighton X. Goping G. Caohuy H. Miller G. Pichel J. Westphal H. Mears D. Rojas E. Pollard H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13783-13788Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Further, the IP3R was demonstrated to co-localize with chromogranin A in the secretory granules of bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (20Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it was not known what isoforms of IP3R exist on the secretory granule membrane. Present results demonstrate the presence of all three types of IP3R in the secretory granules of bovine adrenal medullary chromaffin cells (Fig. 2). By co-transfection of IP3R-1 and CGA or CGB into COS-7 cells, followed by co-immunoprecipitation of the expressed proteins, we have shown previously that the IP3R-1 and CGA or CGB form complexes in the cell (20Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Likewise, co-transfection and co-immunoprecipitation studies using the IP3R-2, -3 and chromogranins A and B further demonstrated the complex formation between CGA and the IP3R-2 or -3 (Fig. 4) and between CGB and the IP3R-2 or -3 (Fig. 5). The complex formation between the IP3Rs and chromogranins A and B appeared to be an intrinsic property of these Ca2+ channel and Ca2+ storage proteins, reflecting the functional coupling in the secretory granules of secretory cells. It is hence of great importance that the results in Fig. 6 clearly demonstrate that the secretory granules of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells not only contain all three isoforms of IP3R but also they form complexes with CGA and CGB. This is the first time that chromogranins A and B were shown to form complexes with all three isoforms of IP3R in native state. The widespread presence of CGA and CGB in the secretory granules of secretory cells appears to strongly imply the physiological importance of the coupling between the IP3Rs and the Ca2+ storage proteins in neurons, endo/exocrine cells, and neuroendocrine cells.In line with this importance, the coupling of CGA with the IP3R was indeed shown to modulate the IP3R/Ca2+ channel function (38Yoo S.H. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15067-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Using liposomes incorporated with the purified IP3R-1 in the presence and absence of encapsulated CGA, it was found that the coupled CGA changed the conformation of IP3R-1 such that more IP3 bound to the incorporated IP3R-1 and more Ca2+ were released from the proteoliposomes in the presence of coupled CGA (38Yoo S.H. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15067-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The IP3R/Ca2+ channel modulatory role of CGA was observed only when the intraliposomal pH was maintained at 5.5 (38Yoo S.H. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15067-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the intragranular pH at which the IP3R and CGA remain coupled (16Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). But when the intraliposomal pH was changed to 7.5, CGA failed to exhibit any effect (38Yoo S.H. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15067-15073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) due to its dissociation from the IP3R/Ca2+channel (16Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12001-12006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yoo S.H. So S.H. Kweon H.S. Lee J.S. Kang M.K. Jeon C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12553-12559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It was further shown that the open probability and mean open time of the IP3R/Ca2+ channel were markedly increased in the presence of coupled CGA as determined by single channel recordings using lipid bilayers (39Thrower E.C. Park H.Y. Yoo S.H. Ehrlich B. Biophys. J. 2001; 80 (.a): 455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). But when CGA was decoupled from the IP3R/Ca2+ channel by changing the pH from 5.5 to 7.5, the mean open time and open probability of the IP3R/Ca2+ channel returned to the levels obtained in the absence of CGA (39Thrower E.C. Park H.Y. Yoo S.H. Ehrlich B. Biophys. J. 2001; 80 (.a): 455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).In addition to the increased binding of IP3 and the conformational change of the IP3R/Ca2+ channel as a result of CGA coupling, our preliminary results also suggested that the IP3 sensitivity of the IP3R/Ca2+ channel increases at least 5-fold in the presence of coupled CGA, i.e. 5-fold less IP3 is needed to induce release of same amount of Ca2+ in the presence of coupled CGA than in the absence. 2S. H. Yoo and S. H. So, unpublished results. Moreover, the IP3R/Ca2+ channel modulatory effect of CGA was also similarly exhibited by CGB.2 From these results it appears that the coupled Ca2+ storage proteins CGA and CGB directly modulate the IP3R/Ca2+ channel such that not only the IP3-mediated Ca2+ release property but also the IP3 sensitivity of the IP3R/Ca2+ channels are altered. In light of the fact that chromogranins are most abundant in the secretory granules, it is likely that the secretory granules will be more sensitive to IP3 than other organelles such as the ER and nucleus. Interestingly, it has continuously been shown that despite the presence of IP3R/Ca2+ channels in the nucleus (46Matter N. Ritz M.-F. Freyermuth S. Rogue P. Malviya A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 732-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 439-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), endoplasmic reticulum (21–32), and secretory granules, a given dose of IP3 does not necessarily evoke a uniform release of Ca2+ from these organelles (29Taylor C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 19-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This difference in the amount of Ca2+ released from each IP3 sensitive store in response to a same concentration of IP3 is likely to be influenced by the presence or absence of chromogranins inside the IP3R/Ca2+-containing organelles.In this regard, the example of different sensitivity of IP3sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store to IP3 has clearly been shown in the case of pancreatic acinar cell (10Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 48Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 49Kasai H. Petersen O.H. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 95-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The pancreatic acinar cell is highly polarized that all the zymogen granules are localized in the apical secretory granule region whereas the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus are localized in the basal region of the cell (50Kern H.F. Go V.L.W. The Pancreas: Biology, Pathobiology and Disease. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1993: 9-19Google Scholar). The ER-rich, nucleus-containing cytoplasmic area encircles the apical granule region where the cluster of zymogen granules is found. Due to this kind of highly polarized morphology of pancreatic acinar cells, any IP3 that is produced at a localized plasma membrane region away from the granule area should travel through the ER-rich, nucleus-containing cytoplasm before it can reach the secretory granule area. Indeed, exposure of pancreatic acinar cells to the IP3-producing agonist such as acetylcholine and cholecystokinin has been shown to release Ca2+ from the secretory granule area first although the IP3-producing agonist was applied to the cell surface far removed from the secretory granule-rich area of the cell (10Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 48Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 49Kasai H. Petersen O.H. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 95-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, the release of Ca2+ from the secretory granules of pancreatic acinar cell, ahead of the ER and nucleus (10Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 48Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 49Kasai H. Petersen O.H. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 95-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), clearly demonstrates the fact that the secretory granules are more sensitive to IP3 than the ER or the nucleus.In line with the high capacity, low affinity Ca2+ binding property of CGA at two different conformations (37Yoo S.H. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7740-7745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), CGB also bound 93 mol of Ca2+/mol with a K d of 1.5 mm at pH 5.5, but bound virtually no Ca2+ at pH 7.5 (Fig. 7). These results clearly point out a close relationship between the Ca2+ binding property and the conformation of chromogranins A and B. Considering that binding of IP3 to the IP3R/Ca2+ channel is known to change the conformation of the IP3R/Ca2+ channel (51Mignery G.A. Südhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), it is natural to assume that the conformational change of the IP3R/Ca2+ channel that results from IP3 binding will automatically be transmitted to the coupled chromogranins, which in turn could lead not only to the change in conformation of the chromogranins but also to the change in affinity for Ca2+. This change in affinity for Ca2+ is expected to change the free Ca2+ concentrations inside the secretory granules instantaneously, probably changing from low to high free Ca2+ concentrations. Therefore, given the large amount of calcium (40 mm) in the secretory granule the sudden dissociation of even a small fraction of the bound Ca2+from the chromogranins is likely to produce a relatively high free Ca2+ concentration that could be released into the cytoplasm through the IP3R/Ca2+ channels. Given the direct physical coupling between the IP3R/Ca2+ channels and the Ca2+storage proteins CGA and CGB in the secretory granules, the whole train of events from the binding of IP3 to the release of Ca2+ is expected to take place very fast, in accordance with the fast stimulus secretion responses of secretory cells.In light of the lack of other examples of direct coupling between an ion channel and its cognate ion storage protein, the coupling between the IP3R/Ca2+ channel and chromogranins A and B stands out as the only known example of direct coupling between an ion channel and its cognate ion storage protein. In particular, in view of the fact that the IP3R/Ca2+ channel exists as homo- and/or heterotetrameric structure (21Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K.

These results suggest that Rb represses the E2F target gene by recruiting multiple complexes containing both class I and II HDACs and co-repressors N-CoR/SMRT, mSin3, and Ski/Sno.

PML has the RBCC motif consisting of a C3HC4-type zinc finger (RING finger) motif and two Cys-rich regions (B-boxes), followed by a coiled-coil region. Wild-type PML is localized to nuclear dot-like structures known as PML nuclear bodies (NBs), which are normally comprised of 5–30 discrete domains (24Dyck J.A. Maul G.G. Miller Jr., W.H. Chen J.D.

PML-RARα alters the dot-like NB structure into numerous small speckles, and normal NB structure can be regained by treating the cells with all-trans-retinoic acid (RA). Although PML appears to be involved in multiple functions, including apoptosis and transcriptional activation (reviewed in Ref. 27Ruggero D. Wang Z.G. Pandolfi P.P. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we recently demonstrated that PML directly associates with multiple co-repressors (N-CoR/SMRT, mSin3A, and Ski) and that it is required for Mad-mediated transcriptiona repression (28Khan M.M. Nomura T. Kim H. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Shinagawa T. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Zhong S. Pandolfi P.P. Ishii S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Unlike PML, which directly interacts with co-repressors through its coiled-coil domain, PML-RARα bears two sites that interact with the co-repressors: one is the coiled-coil region on PML and the other is the CoR box on RARα. Via these two sites, PML-RARα may aberrantly bind to the co-repressor-HDAC complex, leading to the Mad-mediated repression. We were interested in determining whether PML/PML-RARα is specific for Mad-mediated silencing or whether this is a common feature of other repressors that utilize co-repressors such as Ski. Here, we report that PML is required for Rb- and TRβ-mediated silencing and that PML-RARα inhibits this silencing. Inhibition of the activity of the tumor suppressor Rb may be an important mechanism for PML-RARα-induced leukemogenesis. Immunostaining of endogenous Rb and endogenous PML in NB4 cells were performed with anti-Rb mouse monoclonal antibody (G3–245, PharMingen) and anti-PML rabbit polyclonal antibodies (28Khan M.M. Nomura T. Kim H. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Shinagawa T. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Zhong S. Pandolfi P.P. Ishii S. Mol.

These procedures and confocal microscopy were performed as described previously (12Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmanares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells (1.5 × 105 cells per six-well plate) were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with a mixture containing the Gal4 site-containing luciferase reporter (1 μg) and either Gal4-Rb (0.01 μg), Gal4-TRβ (0.05 μg), or the Gal4 expression plasmid (0.01 or 0.05 μg) together with the PML expression plasmid pact-PML (0.25 or 0.5 μg) and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK (Promega) (0.25 μg). The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 3 μg by addition of the control plasmid DNA lacking the cDNA. After transfection, cells were cultivated using charcoal-treated serum, and dual luciferase assays were then performed. Similar experiments were performed using the Gal4-δEF1 (0.03 μg) expression plasmid. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against GST-PML were purified using antigen columns. Microinjection assays were performed using Rat-1 cells as described previously (12Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmanares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Wild-type and Pml−/− MEFs (1.5 × 105 cells per six-well plate) were transfected using LipofectAMINE with a mixture containing the Gal4 site-containing luciferase reporter (1.5 μg) and either 2.5 μg each of Gal4-Rb, Gal4-TRβ, the control Gal4 expression plasmid or Gal4-δEF1, and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK (0.5 μg). Dual luciferase assays were performed as described above. CV-1 cells (3 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish) were transfected by the CaPO4 method with a mixture containing the Gal4 site-containing luciferase reporter (1.5 μg) and either Gal4-Rb, Gal4-TRβ, or the Gal4 expression plasmid (0.25 or 0.5 μg) together with the plasmid pact-PML-RARα (0.5 or 1.0 μg), which expresses various forms of PML-RARα, and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK (0.5 μg). Dual luciferase assays were then performed. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 6 μg by addition of the control plasmid DNA lacking the cDNA. Similar experiments were performed using Gal4-δEF1 (0.03 μg) expression plasmid. RA (1 μm) treatment was performed for 30 h before lysate preparation. A mixture containing 0.1 μg of the E2F sites containing luciferase reporter, 0.1 μg of the E2F1 expression plasmid or the control plasmid, and 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5 μg of the PML-RARα expression plasmid together with 0.1 μg of the internal control plasmid pRL-TK was transfected into CV-1 cells (3 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish) using LipofectAMINE, and luciferase assays were performed. The total amount of plasmid DNA was adjusted to 3 μg by addition of the control plasmid DNA lacking the cDNA. To study the interaction between Gal4-Rb and HDAC1, CV-1 cells (6 × 105 cells per 100-mm dish) were co-transfected using LipofectAMINE with Gal4-Rb or the Gal4 expression plasmids pCMV-Gal4-Rb or pCMV-Gal4 (2 μg), the FLAG-HDAC1 expression plasmid pact-FLAG-HDAC1 (2 μg), the PML-RARα expression plasmid pact-PML-RARα (3 μg), and the internal control plasmid pRL-TK (0.1 μg). Forty hours after transfection, cells were lysed by sonication in LSLD buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 20% glycerol), and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Gal4 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Westerm blotting was performed using anti-FLAG antibody. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous Rb and HDAC proteins of NB4 cells, cells were treated with RA (1 μm) or control solvent for 70 h. Lysates were prepared by mild sonication in LDLD buffer. Anti-Rb rabbit antibodies (C-15, Santa Cruz) were used for immunoprecipitation. The immunocomplexes were washed with TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) and used for Western blotting with anti-HDAC1 (C-19, Santa Cruz) and anti-HDAC2 (C-19, Santa Cruz) goat polyclonal antibodies. As reported previously by Alcalay et al. (29Alcalay M. Tomassoni L. Colombo E. Stoldt S. Grignani F. Fagioli M. Szekely L. Helin K. Pelicci P.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), Rb was found to co-localize with PML. For this purpose, we used APL-derived NB4 cells, which express PML-RARα and undergo differentiation after RA treatment (Fig. 1 A). RA treatment of NB4 cells induces degradation of PML-RARα, resulting in the recovery of the normal dot-like structures of NBs containing PML. In RA-treated NB4 cells, endogenous Rb and PML co-localized to NBs. We observed that some PML signals did not co-localize with Rb. This might be explained by the association of a proportion of PML molecules with co-activator such as CBP. The physical association of PML with Rb raised the possibility that PML might be important for transcriptional repression mediated by Rb. To investigate this, we first examined the effect of overexpression of PML on Rb-mediated repression (Fig. 1 B). The Gal4-Rb fusion, which consists of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and the repressor domain of Rb, repressed transcription from a Gal4 site-containing reporter. This Gal4-Rb-induced repression was further enhanced by PML. Similar results were obtained with the Gal4-TRβ. This effect of PML was specific to Rb and TRβ, since PML did not enhance the repression by another repressor δEF1, whose repressor activity was previously shown not to be mediated by the co-repressor c-Ski (12Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.-D. Wadhwa R. Colmanares C. Kohno I. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Micro-injection experiments were then performed using a Gal4-lacZ reporter containing Gal4-binding sites (Fig.2 A). Injection of the reporter into Rat-1 cells gave rise to many lacZ-positive cells, whereas co-injection of the lacZ reporter with the plasmid encoding Gal4-Rb or Gal4-TRβ resulted in a decrease in the number of lacZ-positive cells. This decrease was partially relieved by co-injection with anti-PML antibody. The effect of the anti-PML antibody could be blocked by co-injection with the PML expression plasmid. In contrast, anti-PML antibody did not affect repression by the Gal4-δEF1 fusion, whose repressor activity does not require the c-Ski complex. The incomplete abrogation of the Gal-Rb and Gal4-TRβ function by anti-PML antibody may be due to the presence of other PML-related protein(s) containing the RBCC motif. To further confirm that PML is involved in Rb- and TRβ-mediated repression, we used MEFs from a Pml-deficient mouse (Fig.2 B). The degree of repression by Gal4-Rb or Gal4-TRβ in Pml−/− cells was lower than that in wild-type cells, whereas the repressor activity of Gal4-δEF1 was similar in both types of cells. The incomplete abrogation of repression mediated by Gal4-Rb or Gal4-TRβ in Pml−/− cells may be due to the presence of PML-like proteins containing the RBCC motif. As we recently reported (28Khan M.M. Nomura T. Kim H. Kaul S.C. Wadhwa R. Shinagawa T. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Zhong S. Pandolfi P.P. Ishii S. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), PML-RARα inhibits Mad-mediated repression. This activity of PML-RARα required the presence of two sites that interact with the co-repressors: one is the coiled-coil region on PML, and the other is the CoR box on RARα (Fig.3 A). This suggests that PML-RARα may change the conformation of the co-repressor-HDAC complex by binding aberrantly to it, thereby abrogating Mad-mediated repression. Since PML is also required for Rb-mediated repression, we speculated that PML-RARα also inhibits Rb-mediated repression. To investigate this possibility, co-transfection assays were performed (Fig. 3 A). Normal PML-RARα abrogated Rb-induced transcriptional repression, while the PML-RARα mutant lacking the PML coiled-coil region and/or the functional RARα CoR box did not. Furthermore, RA treatment of transfected cells blocked the effect of PML-RARα. Similar results were also obtained using Gal4-TRβ. In contrast, normal PML-RARα did not affect the repression mediated by Gal4-δEF1. These results indicate that the presence of two sites in PMLRARα, which interact with the co-repressors-HDAC complex, mediates the abrogation of repression by Rb and TRβ. By using the E2F1 site-containing luciferase reporter, we further confirmed the effect of PML-RARα on Rb activity (Fig. 3 B). Co-transfection of this reporter into CV-1 cells together with small amount of the E2F1 expression plasmid slightly enhanced the luciferase expression. This suggested that E2F binds to specific sites on the promoter to enhance transcription from the reporter. Co-expression of PML-RARα with this reporter and the E2F1 expression plasmid enhanced the luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that PML-RARα inhibits the activity of endogenous Rb. These results indicate that PML-RARα inhibits Rb-dependent transcriptional repression. The results described above suggest that an interaction between Rb and two sites on PML-RARα mediates inhibition of Rb activity. One possibility is that PML-RARα blocks the interaction between Rb and the co-repressor-HDAC complex. We examined this by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.4 A). The plasmids expressing FLAG-HDAC1 and Gal4-Rb were transfected into 293T cells together with the PML-RARα expression plasmid or the control plasmid. Lysates from the transfected cells were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-Gal4 antibody. A significant amount of HDAC1 was co-precipitated with Gal4-Rb in the absence of PML-RARα, whereas PML-RARα strongly reduced the amount of co-precipitated HDAC1. To directly investigate the effect of PML-RARα on the interaction between endogenous Rb and HDAC, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using RA-treated and untreated NB4 cells (Fig. 4 B). NB4 cells express PML-RARα, whereas RA treatment of NB4 cells induces degradation of PML-RARα. Anti-Rb antibody co-precipitated the endogenous HDAC1 and HDAC2 proteins in the lysates from RA-treated NB4 cells, but not from lysates of untreated cells. Similar amounts of endogenous Rb were precipitated by anti-Rb antibody from RA-treated and untreated NB4 cells. These results suggest that PML-RARα inhibits the association between Rb and HDAC. Our results indicate that PML and PML-RARα have opposite affects on Rb-mediated transcriptional repression; PML stimulates Rb-mediated transcriptional repression, whereas PML-RARα inhibits Rb activity. The presence of two sites on the PML-RARa molecule, which interact with the co-repressors, is required for the inhibition of Rb activity. This suggests that the binding of PML-RARα to the co-repressors complexes induces a conformational change in the complexes, which blocks the interaction between Rb and HDAC. Since we recently demonstrated that PML-RARα also blocks Mad-mediated repression, the activity of two tumor suppressors, Mad and Rb, are probably inhibited through this mechanism. Thus, our results suggest an important role for Rb in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Consistent with this, it was reported that Rb protein is defective in binding to a viral oncoprotein in the M3 promyelocytic subtype of acute myeloid leukemia patients (30Paggi M.G. de Fabritiis P. Bonetto F. Amadio L. Santarelli G. Spadea A. Gentile F.P. Floridi A. Felsani A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4552-4556PubMed Google Scholar). Rb function was only partly abrogated by injection of anti-PML antibody andonly partly diminished in Pml−/− cells. This may be due to the presence of PML-like proteins containing the RBCC motif. In fact, we found that another RBCC motif-containing protein, RFP (Ret finger protein), also directly interacts with multiple co-repressors including Ski. 2M. M. Khan, T. Nomura, and S. Ishii, unpublished data. It is interesting to note that the N terminus of RFP is fused to the retproto-oncoprotein in transformed NIH3T3 cells (31Takahashi M. Ritz J. Cooper G.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 581-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Since RFP was reported to associate with PML NBs (32Cao T. Duprez E. Borden K.L. Freemont P.S. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1319-1329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RFP-Ret fusion oncoprotein may also affect Mad and Rb activities like PML-RARα. At present, relatively little is unknown about how PML acts in transcriptional repression. However, one hypothesis is that PML and possibly other RBCC motif-containing proteins may act as key factors, such as scaffold proteins, to maintain the correct architecture or subcellular localization of co-repressors-HDAC complexes. Thus, PML and PML-RARα may have the capacity to affect the activity of many other repressors. We thank A. Kakizuka and R. Evans for the PML, PML-RARα, and TRβ cDNA clones; Y. Honma for the NB4 cell line; and M. Rosenfeld for the TK-lacZ reporter containing the Gal4 sites."

Semaphorin 3A (Sema 3A) induces growth cone collapse in chick dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurones, a response mediated by Rac 1 (8Jin Z. Strittmater S.M. J.

Herman R.K. Shaw J.E. Genetics. 1992; 132: 675-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crmp-2 is a brain substrate of ROK (14Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Menager C. Nakamura N. Amano M. Iwamatsu A. Goshima Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23973-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and it also interacts with α2-chimaerin, a neuronal Rac regulator that promotes neuritogenesis (15Hall C. Michael G.J. Cann N. Ferrari G. Teo M. Jacobs T. Monfries C. Lim L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5191-5202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).We have found that expression of Crmp-2 in neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells can alter Rho-GTPase-driven morphology. Co-expression of Crmp-2 with dominant active RhoA V14 promoted cell spreading and neurite formation, mediated by Rac. Co-expression of Crmp-2 with dominant active Rac1 V12 inhibited Rac morphology, an effect that was blocked by mutation of a single ROK phosphorylation site in Crmp-2 or by kinase-inactive ROK. Microinjection of Crmp-2 in Rac1 V12-expressing cells with pre-existing Rac morphology led to Rho-dependent localized collapse of the Rac phenotype. Crmp-2, in combination with active Rho or Rac GTPases, can thus effect a cyclical switch in signaling in which ROK has a regulatory role, promoting dynamic shape changes.DISCUSSIONIn N1E-115 cells Rho and Cdc42/Rac have antagonistic effects on cell morphology. Rho (and ROK) activation cause neurite retraction and cell rounding, whereas Rac/Cdc42 activity promotes cell flattening and neurite outgrowth (1Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 4Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebok A. Marshall F. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 fibroblasts also show a reciprocal balance between Rac and Rho activation (21Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). We have found that Crmp-2, in combination with dominant active RhoA V14, can generate Rac morphology, a switch in GTPase signaling. This result is unexpected; activation of Rac (and Cdc42) in response to Rho activation does not usually occur, although there is some activation of Rho in a hierarchy downstream of Rac in Swiss 3T3 cells (22Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). In the absence of dominant active RhoA V14, Crmp-2 alone had little effect, indicating this is a positive signaling event. The morphological changes generated by Crmp-2 with RhoA V14 were blocked by co-expression of dominant negative Rac1 N17 in N1E-115 cells, but to a much lesser extent by Cdc42 N17, indicating that Rac is activated independently of Cdc42.Conversely, in N1E-115 cells already expressing dominant active Rac1 V12, microinjection of Crmp-2 caused peripheral collapse and formation of microspikes, which could be blocked by co-injection of RhoA N19 and Cdc42 N17, respectively. The formation of Rac morphology was inhibited by co-expression of Crmp-2 with Rac1 V12. These effects are consistent with inhibition of Rac-GTP and subsequent activation of Rho (and Cdc42). Crmp-2 thus effects a reversible switch between Rho and Rac signaling pathways, which could contribute to the dynamics of growth cone guidance. Sema 3A-induced growth cone collapse in sensory neurones is Rac-dependent (8Jin Z. Strittmater S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vastrik I. Eickholt B.J. Walsh F.S Ridley A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 991-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Crmp-2, a component of the Sema 3A pathway (12Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmater P. Strittmater S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), can initiate collapse downstream of Rac activation.The activity of Crmp-2 in promoting Rac inhibition appears to be regulated by phosphorylation by ROK, because mutation of Crmp-2 at threonine 555, or co-expression of kinase-inactive ROK with Crmp-2, prevented the RacV12-dependent Crmp-2 effects. In contrast, RhoA V14/Crmp-2 generation of a Rac phenotype was not inhibited by the T555A mutation. Phosphorylation of Crmp-2 T555 by ROK thus provides a dynamic regulatory mechanism. In axonal outgrowth in which Rac/Cdc42 signaling may predominate, growth cone collapse could be initiated by Crmp-2 activated locally (in response to guidance signals) by ROK. Inhibition of active Rac could lead to amplification of Rho-dependent collapse, an activity rapidly terminated by dephosphorylation, reactivating the Rac signaling, which can occur in response to active Rho and Crmp-2. Immature dendrites are extremely dynamic, changing their structure over seconds (23Wong W.T. Wong R.O.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It may be relevant that threonine 555 in Crmp-2 is also one of two consensus sites for cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. The signaling of guidance factors can be switched from a repulsive to an attractive cue by altering local concentrations of cAMP/cGMP (24Song H.-J Ming G.-L. He Z. Lehmann M. Kerracho L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M.-M. Science. 1998; 281: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Sema 3A acts as a chemoattractant in cortical apical dendrites but not axons, a response mediated by the asymmetrical localization of soluble guanylate cyclase, elevating local cGMP levels (10Polleux F.

The threonine 555 phosphorylation site is not conserved in the other Crmp proteins, providing some specificity in regulation of Crmp-2/Crmp heteromers.

Interestingly, myelin-induced growth cone collapse is inhibited by dominant active Rho (32Kuhn T.B. Brown M.D. Wilcox C.L. Raper J.A. Bamburg J.R. J.

Its effects in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts argues in favor of a direct effect of Crmp-2 on Rho/ROK or alternatively that other components of Crmp-2 signaling pathways are not restricted to neuronal cell types. COS cells transfected with neuropilin neuropilin-1/plexin co-receptors show Sema 3A-induced collapse (28Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F. Wang L.-H. Murakami Y. Kalb R.G. Fujisawa H.

It is possible that Crmp-2 directly inhibits ROK through its interaction with activated ROK or Rho-GTP.2 Co-expression of Crmp-2 with Rac1 V12, but not RhoA V14, displaces Crmp-2 from the membrane.2 In the Rac-dependent Sema 3A pathway in neurones, endogenous Crmp-2 may become relocated and/or complexed with other proteins and act upstream of Rho. Guanine exchange factors such as Trio, a dual specificity Rho/Rac guanine exchange factor involved in axonal guidance (38Newsome T.P. Schmidt S. Dietzl G. Keleman K. Asling B. Debant A. Dickson B.J.

Crmp-2, in combination with either active Rho or Rac GTPases, and pivotally regulated by ROK, can switch GTPase signaling, which has implications for the dynamics of neuronal growth cone guidance. The Rho GTPase family, which regulates the actin cytoskeleton, has been shown to be involved in processes of neurite outgrowth. In neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells, Rac1 promotes the formation of lamellipodia, and Cdc42 promotes the formation of filopodia, which have a sensory role in growth of neurites (1Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Cdc42 signaling to Rac1 can also occur (2Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

Rho acts antagonistically to Rac and Cdc42 in N1E-115 cells inducing growth cone collapse, neurite retraction, and cell rounding (1Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

The directional growth of axons and dendrites in embryonic nervous system is influenced by a series of guidance cues (7Tessier-Lavigne M. Goodman C.S. Science. 1996; 274: 1123-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (2674) Google Scholar). Semaphorin 3A (Sema 3A) induces growth cone collapse in chick dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurones, a response mediated by Rac 1 (8Jin Z. Strittmater S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) acting through its effectors (9Vastrik I. Eickholt B.J. Walsh F.S Ridley A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 991-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Sema 3A can also act as an attractant for cortical apical dendrites (10Polleux F. Morrow T. Ghosh A. Nature. 2000; 404: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Collapsin response mediator protein-2 (Crmp-2), which is expressed in post-mitotic neurones (11Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J.L. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6757-6766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is implicated in the Sema 3A response (12Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmater P. Strittmater S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and is one of a family of proteins related to theCaenorhabditis elegans Unc 33 gene involved in axonal outgrowth (13Li W. Herman R.K. Shaw J.E. Genetics. 1992; 132: 675-689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crmp-2 is a brain substrate of ROK (14Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Menager C. Nakamura N. Amano M. Iwamatsu A. Goshima Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23973-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and it also interacts with α2-chimaerin, a neuronal Rac regulator that promotes neuritogenesis (15Hall C. Michael G.J. Cann N. Ferrari G. Teo M. Jacobs T. Monfries C. Lim L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5191-5202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that expression of Crmp-2 in neuroblastoma N1E-115 cells can alter Rho-GTPase-driven morphology. Co-expression of Crmp-2 with dominant active RhoA V14 promoted cell spreading and neurite formation, mediated by Rac. Co-expression of Crmp-2 with dominant active Rac1 V12 inhibited Rac morphology, an effect that was blocked by mutation of a single ROK phosphorylation site in Crmp-2 or by kinase-inactive ROK. Microinjection of Crmp-2 in Rac1 V12-expressing cells with pre-existing Rac morphology led to Rho-dependent localized collapse of the Rac phenotype. Crmp-2, in combination with active Rho or Rac GTPases, can thus effect a cyclical switch in signaling in which ROK has a regulatory role, promoting dynamic shape changes. DISCUSSIONIn N1E-115 cells Rho and Cdc42/Rac have antagonistic effects on cell morphology. Rho (and ROK) activation cause neurite retraction and cell rounding, whereas Rac/Cdc42 activity promotes cell flattening and neurite outgrowth (1Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 4Tigyi G. Fischer D.J. Sebok A. Marshall F. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 549-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E.T. van der Kammen R.A. Michaels F. Kranenburg O.W. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 fibroblasts also show a reciprocal balance between Rac and Rho activation (21Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). We have found that Crmp-2, in combination with dominant active RhoA V14, can generate Rac morphology, a switch in GTPase signaling. This result is unexpected; activation of Rac (and Cdc42) in response to Rho activation does not usually occur, although there is some activation of Rho in a hierarchy downstream of Rac in Swiss 3T3 cells (22Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). In the absence of dominant active RhoA V14, Crmp-2 alone had little effect, indicating this is a positive signaling event. The morphological changes generated by Crmp-2 with RhoA V14 were blocked by co-expression of dominant negative Rac1 N17 in N1E-115 cells, but to a much lesser extent by Cdc42 N17, indicating that Rac is activated independently of Cdc42.Conversely, in N1E-115 cells already expressing dominant active Rac1 V12, microinjection of Crmp-2 caused peripheral collapse and formation of microspikes, which could be blocked by co-injection of RhoA N19 and Cdc42 N17, respectively. The formation of Rac morphology was inhibited by co-expression of Crmp-2 with Rac1 V12. These effects are consistent with inhibition of Rac-GTP and subsequent activation of Rho (and Cdc42). Crmp-2 thus effects a reversible switch between Rho and Rac signaling pathways, which could contribute to the dynamics of growth cone guidance. Sema 3A-induced growth cone collapse in sensory neurones is Rac-dependent (8Jin Z. Strittmater S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vastrik I. Eickholt B.J. Walsh F.S Ridley A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 991-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Crmp-2, a component of the Sema 3A pathway (12Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmater P. Strittmater S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), can initiate collapse downstream of Rac activation.The activity of Crmp-2 in promoting Rac inhibition appears to be regulated by phosphorylation by ROK, because mutation of Crmp-2 at threonine 555, or co-expression of kinase-inactive ROK with Crmp-2, prevented the RacV12-dependent Crmp-2 effects. In contrast, RhoA V14/Crmp-2 generation of a Rac phenotype was not inhibited by the T555A mutation. Phosphorylation of Crmp-2 T555 by ROK thus provides a dynamic regulatory mechanism. In axonal outgrowth in which Rac/Cdc42 signaling may predominate, growth cone collapse could be initiated by Crmp-2 activated locally (in response to guidance signals) by ROK. Inhibition of active Rac could lead to amplification of Rho-dependent collapse, an activity rapidly terminated by dephosphorylation, reactivating the Rac signaling, which can occur in response to active Rho and Crmp-2. Immature dendrites are extremely dynamic, changing their structure over seconds (23Wong W.T. Wong R.O.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It may be relevant that threonine 555 in Crmp-2 is also one of two consensus sites for cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. The signaling of guidance factors can be switched from a repulsive to an attractive cue by altering local concentrations of cAMP/cGMP (24Song H.-J Ming G.-L. He Z. Lehmann M. Kerracho L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M.-M. Science. 1998; 281: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Sema 3A acts as a chemoattractant in cortical apical dendrites but not axons, a response mediated by the asymmetrical localization of soluble guanylate cyclase, elevating local cGMP levels (10Polleux F. Morrow T. Ghosh A. Nature. 2000; 404: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) with the potential to activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 fibroblasts also show a reciprocal balance between Rac and Rho activation (21Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). We have found that Crmp-2, in combination with dominant active RhoA V14, can generate Rac morphology, a switch in GTPase signaling. This result is unexpected; activation of Rac (and Cdc42) in response to Rho activation does not usually occur, although there is some activation of Rho in a hierarchy downstream of Rac in Swiss 3T3 cells (22Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar). In the absence of dominant active RhoA V14, Crmp-2 alone had little effect, indicating this is a positive signaling event. The morphological changes generated by Crmp-2 with RhoA V14 were blocked by co-expression of dominant negative Rac1 N17 in N1E-115 cells, but to a much lesser extent by Cdc42 N17, indicating that Rac is activated independently of Cdc42. Conversely, in N1E-115 cells already expressing dominant active Rac1 V12, microinjection of Crmp-2 caused peripheral collapse and formation of microspikes, which could be blocked by co-injection of RhoA N19 and Cdc42 N17, respectively. The formation of Rac morphology was inhibited by co-expression of Crmp-2 with Rac1 V12. These effects are consistent with inhibition of Rac-GTP and subsequent activation of Rho (and Cdc42). Crmp-2 thus effects a reversible switch between Rho and Rac signaling pathways, which could contribute to the dynamics of growth cone guidance. Sema 3A-induced growth cone collapse in sensory neurones is Rac-dependent (8Jin Z. Strittmater S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vastrik I. Eickholt B.J. Walsh F.S Ridley A. Doherty P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 991-997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that Crmp-2, a component of the Sema 3A pathway (12Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmater P. Strittmater S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), can initiate collapse downstream of Rac activation. The activity of Crmp-2 in promoting Rac inhibition appears to be regulated by phosphorylation by ROK, because mutation of Crmp-2 at threonine 555, or co-expression of kinase-inactive ROK with Crmp-2, prevented the RacV12-dependent Crmp-2 effects. In contrast, RhoA V14/Crmp-2 generation of a Rac phenotype was not inhibited by the T555A mutation. Phosphorylation of Crmp-2 T555 by ROK thus provides a dynamic regulatory mechanism. In axonal outgrowth in which Rac/Cdc42 signaling may predominate, growth cone collapse could be initiated by Crmp-2 activated locally (in response to guidance signals) by ROK. Inhibition of active Rac could lead to amplification of Rho-dependent collapse, an activity rapidly terminated by dephosphorylation, reactivating the Rac signaling, which can occur in response to active Rho and Crmp-2. Immature dendrites are extremely dynamic, changing their structure over seconds (23Wong W.T. Wong R.O.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 118-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It may be relevant that threonine 555 in Crmp-2 is also one of two consensus sites for cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. The signaling of guidance factors can be switched from a repulsive to an attractive cue by altering local concentrations of cAMP/cGMP (24Song H.-J Ming G.-L. He Z. Lehmann M. Kerracho L. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M.-M. Science. 1998; 281: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Sema 3A acts as a chemoattractant in cortical apical dendrites but not axons, a response mediated by the asymmetrical localization of soluble guanylate cyclase, elevating local cGMP levels (10Polleux F. Morrow T. Ghosh A. Nature. 2000; 404: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) with the potential to activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation. The time course of Rac1 V12/Crmp-2 effects in N1E-115 cells does not preclude the involvement of an autocrine pathway, although in preliminary experiments conditioned media from cells expressing Crmp-2 for 24 h did not affect morphology of Rac1 V12- or RhoA V14-expressing cells. Crmp-2 is one of a family of Crmp proteins widely expressed in the developing nervous system (25Wang L.-H. Strittmater S.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 6197-6207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and persisting in adult brain (26Kamata T. Subleski M. Hara Y. Yuhki N. Kung H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Yoshimura T. Modi W. Copeland T.D. Mol. Brain. Res. 1998; 54: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that could function (possibly as heteromers (27Wang L.-H. Strittmater S.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2261-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar)) in response to other signaling cues. The threonine 555 phosphorylation site is not conserved in the other Crmp proteins, providing some specificity in regulation of Crmp-2/Crmp heteromers. Sema 3A binds neuropilin and its co-receptor plexin A1 (28Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F. Wang L.-H. Murakami Y. Kalb R.G. Fujisawa H. Strittmater S. Cell. 1999; 99: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Recently, activated Rac has been shown to bind directly to plexin B1 (29Rohm B. Rahim B. Kleiber B. Hovatta I. Puschel A.W. FEBS Lett. 2000; 46: 68-72Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30Vikis H.G. Li W. He Z. Guan K.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2001; 11: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Clustering of these receptors (in the absence of Rac binding) was sufficient to activate Rho signaling (31Driessens M.H.E. Hu H. Nobes C.D. Self A. Jordens I. Goodman C.S. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 339-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar); however, the Rac dependence of the subsequent Rho morphology could implicate a Crmp-like component. Interestingly, myelin-induced growth cone collapse is inhibited by dominant active Rho (32Kuhn T.B. Brown M.D. Wilcox C.L. Raper J.A. Bamburg J.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 9: 1965-1975Crossref Google Scholar) (rather than dominant negative Rac N17 as with Sema 3A (8Jin Z. Strittmater S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6256-6263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), which also caused extensive outgrowth of motor neuron axons on a myelin substrate (32Kuhn T.B. Brown M.D. Wilcox C.L. Raper J.A. Bamburg J.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 9: 1965-1975Crossref Google Scholar). In DRG neurones Crmp-2 is phosphorylated by ROK in response to LPA but not Sema 3A, and mutation of Crmp-2 at Thr-555 inhibited LPA-induced collapse (14Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Menager C. Nakamura N. Amano M. Iwamatsu A. Goshima Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23973-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), pointing to a role for Crmp-2 (phosphorylated by ROK) in the LPA collapse. However, this inhibition was only partial (14Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Menager C. Nakamura N. Amano M. Iwamatsu A. Goshima Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23973-23980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), which could result from a balance between Rac- and Rho-driven morphological effects regulated by Crmp-2. Ephrin-A5-induced collapse of retinal growth cones, by a Rho-/ROK-dependent pathway (33Wahl S. Barth H. Ciossek T. Aktories K. Mueller B.K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), was also only partially inhibited by Rho and ROK inhibitors. In the Rac-dependent Sema 3A pathway in DRG neurons, phosphorylation of Crmp-2 by ROK was not detected, but it may be phosphorylated by other kinases (14Arimura N. Inagaki N. Chihara K. Menager C.

The effect of the Crmp-2 T555A mutant in Sema 3A-induced growth cone collapse was not described. The dynamics of Sema 3A-induced collapse can produce transient changes in phosphorylation status, as with the phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM kinase (activated downstream of ROK or PAK), which is necessary for growth one collapse (34Aizawa H. Wakatsuki S. Ishii A. Moriyama K. Sasaki Y. Ohashi K. Sekine-Aizawa Y. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Mizuno K. Goshima Y. Yahara I. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Crmp-2 alters Rho family GTPase activity is unclear, but Crmp is related to dihydropyrimidinase (11Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J.L. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6757-6766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Hamajima N. Matsuda K. Sakata S. Tamaki N. Sasaki M. Nonaka M. Gene. 1996; 180: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and has some sequence similarity to guanine aminohydrolase (36Yuan G. Bin J.C. McKay D.J. Snyder F.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8175-8180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), although no enzyme activity has so far been identified (12Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmater P. Strittmater S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Its effects in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts argues in favor of a direct effect of Crmp-2 on Rho/ROK or alternatively that other components of Crmp-2 signaling pathways are not restricted to neuronal cell types. COS cells transfected with neuropilin neuropilin-1/plexin co-receptors show Sema 3A-induced collapse (28Takahashi T. Fournier A. Nakamura F. Wang L.-H. Murakami Y. Kalb R.G. Fujisawa H. Strittmater S. Cell. 1999; 99: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), and neuropilin-1, a receptor for the angiogenesis factor vascular endothelia growth factor, as well as Sema 3A, is also expressed in endothelial and tumor cells (37Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. Cell. 1998; 92: 735-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar). It is possible that Crmp-2 directly inhibits ROK through its interaction with activated ROK or Rho-GTP.2 Co-expression of Crmp-2 with Rac1 V12, but not RhoA V14, displaces Crmp-2 from the membrane.2 In the Rac-dependent Sema 3A pathway in neurones, endogenous Crmp-2 may become relocated and/or complexed with other proteins and act upstream of Rho. Guanine exchange factors such as Trio, a dual specificity Rho/Rac guanine exchange factor involved in axonal guidance (38Newsome T.P. Schmidt S. Dietzl G. Keleman K. Asling B. Debant A. Dickson B.J. Cell. 2000; 101: 283-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), or GTPase-activating protein may also participate in modulation of Rho and Rac activity. Chimaerin (with which Crmp-2 can interact) itself affects growth cone dynamics (17Kozma R. Ahmed S. Best A. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5069-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Crmp-2, in combination with either active Rho or Rac GTPases, and pivotally regulated by ROK, can switch GTPase signaling, which has implications for the dynamics of neuronal growth cone guidance.

https://openalex.org/W1998380296,"Mammalian homologues of DnaJ proteins, also known as Hsp40 proteins, are co-chaperonins that complement Hsp70 chaperone function. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we cloned an apolipoprotein (apo) B mRNA editing complementation protein, called apobec-1-binding protein-2 (ABBP-2), and found that it is a Class II DnaJ homologue. ABBP-2 binds to apobec-1, the mammalian apoB mRNA editase, via its J domain and neighboring G/F domain. It is a ubiquitously expressed protein, and, by transfection analysis of GFP-ABBP-2, we found that the protein is located in both the nucleus and cytosol of transfected cells, with predominance in the nucleus. Down-regulation of ABBP-2 expression in cultured cells inhibits endogenous apobec-1-mediated apoB mRNA editing. Like other Hsp40 proteins, ABBP-2 binds to Hsp70 and has ATPase-stimulating activity. Apobec-1-mediated apoB mRNA editing activity of in vitro tissue extracts requires the presence of Hsp70/ABBP-2. Although exogenously added ATP is not required for editing activity, removal of the endogenous ATP present in these extracts, which disrupts ABBP-2-Hsp70 interaction, completely inhibits editing. ABBP-2 differs from previously described auxiliary proteins (ABBP-1, ACF, and GRY-RBP) in that it does not contain any RNA recognition motifs. Not only is ABBP-2 required for efficient apoB mRNA editing, this newly discovered apobec-1-binding protein may help determine the subcellular distribution and trafficking of apobec-1 via its interaction with the chaperonin Hsp70.

The Hsp70 class of chaperones plays a diverse role in cell physiology (1Mallouk Y. Vayssier-Taussat M. Bonventre J.V. Polla B.S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 463-474PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hartl F.U.

They participate in different processes, including protein translation, translocation, folding, and the assembly and disassembly of protein complexes. In many cases, the specificity of Hsp70 interaction with their substrates is conferred by the DnaJ class of co-chaperones (4Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The binding of Hsp70s to their target polypeptides is ATP hydrolysis-dependent. ATP-bound Hsp70 has a relatively low affinity for its substrate, primarily because of a high off rate, whereas ADP-bound Hsp70 has a high affinity, due to its lower off rate (5Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp70s is extremely weak, and co-chaperones such as DnaJs are essential to Hsp70 action by stimulating ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, some DnaJ proteins associate directly with substrate polypeptides, which they then transfer to Hsp70 (6Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar): an N-terminal ∼70-amino acid J domain, which includes a highly conserved HPD tripeptide, a neighboring G/F domain rich in glycine and phenylalanine residues, a cysteine-rich zinc finger domain, followed by a poorly conserved C-terminal domain (13Huang K. Flanagan J.M. Prestegard J.H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Suh W.C. Lu C.Z. Gross C.A. J. Biol.

The DnaJ/Hsp40 class of proteins is divided into three subgroups based on the presence or absence of domains other than the J domain: Class I DnaJ/Hsp40s possess all the other three domains present in DnaJ. Class II DnaJ/Hsp40s lack the zinc finger domain. Class III DnaJ/Hsp40s contain the J domain as the only conserved structure.

The solution structures of the J domains of E. coli DnaJ and the mammalian Hsp40 protein Hdj1 have been solved by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (17Hill R.B. Flanagan J.M. Prestegard J.H.

Despite the fact that there is only a 54% sequence similarity between the two J domains, their tertiary structures are remarkably similar. Both consist of four α-helices. Helices II and III are antiparallel. Hydrophobic residues on the amphipathic interior surfaces of helices I, II, and III define the core and stabilize the structure of the J domain (4Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The amino acids on the outer surface of helices II and III, including the connecting loop that contains the HPD tripeptide, are thought to be important in determining the affinity and specificity of binding of the J domain to its Hsp70 partner (16Greene M.K.

A major role of the J domain appears to be the recruitment of Hsp70 to a specific polypeptide substrate; together they mediate functions as diverse as protein translation, translocation, cell cycle regulation, karyogamy, exocytosis, and growth regulation, among others (11Kelley W.L.

Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar).In this report, we demonstrate that a novel DnaJ protein is involved in eukaryotic mRNA editing. Apolipoprotein B mRNA editing, the sequence-specific deamination of apoB-100 to apoB-48 mRNA, is mediated by a specific editase, apobec-1, but only in the context of an editosome complex that also contains other auxiliary proteins (25Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The DnaJ protein identified, called ABBP-2 (apobec1-binding protein-2), directly interacts with apobec-1. We further showed that ABBP-2 function involves the ATP hydrolysis-dependent recruitment of Hsp70 to the editase, up-regulating apobec-1-mediated apoB mRNA editing, which we show to be ATP-dependent. Down-regulation of the DnaJ protein ABBP-2 inhibits apoB mRNA editing.DISCUSSIONApoB mRNA editing was the first instance of RNA editing identified in vertebrates (44Chen S.H. Habib G. Yang C.Y. Gu Z.W. Lee B.R. Weng S.A. Silberman S.R. Cai S.J. Deslypere J.P. Rosseneu M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Li W.H. Chan L. Science. 1987; 238: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 45Powell L.M.

Horm. Res. 2000; 55: 93-125PubMed Google Scholar). It is mediated by a multicomponent editosome complex, of which the catalytic subunit was identified as a sequence-specific cytidine deaminase, apobec-1 (25Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 46Chan L. Chang B.H. Liao W. Oka K. Lau P.P. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2000; 55: 93-125PubMed Google Scholar). From the time that apobec-1 was cloned, it was known that, by itself, the enzyme has minimal activity against apoB mRNA as a substrate (25Teng B. Burant C.F. Davidson N.O. Science. 1993; 260: 1816-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Optimal editing requires the presence of other protein(s) known as auxiliary or complementation protein(s). In the last several years, three putative auxiliary proteins, ABBP-1 (27Lau P.P. Zhu H.J. Nakamuta M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1452-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), ACF (also known as ASP) (34Lellek H. Kirsten R. Diehl I. Apostel F. Buck F. Greeve J. J. Biol.

Commun. 2001; 282: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 37Blanc V. Navaratnam N. Henderson J.O. Anant S. Kennedy S. Jarmuz A. Scott J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10272-10283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) have been cloned. These proteins share some common properties. They all display binding activity toward apobec-1, which is not surprising because their affinity toward apobec-1 was one of the criteria for their identification. Interestingly, they also share another important common feature. All three proteins contain RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) (28Lau P.P. Chang B.H. Chan L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); ABBP-1 contains two copies, and ACF and GRY-RBP, each three copies, of RRM. The fact that these auxiliary factors are RNA-binding proteins suggests that they may be involved in anchoring and presenting the substrate mRNA to apobec-1 within the editosome complex for editing. Although, like other complementation proteins studied to date, ABBP-2 also displays apobec-1-binding activity, it is the only auxiliary protein identified to date that does not contain any known RNA-binding motif. Furthermore, as a DnaJ protein, it is the only auxiliary protein that belongs to a family of co-chaperone proteins.ABBP-2 is a Class II DnaJ homologue and is a member of the Hsp40 group of co-chaperonins. The J domain of ABBP-2, together with the neighboring G/F domain, is essential for apobec-1 binding. We showed that, in cultured mammalian cells, down-regulation of ABBP-2 inhibits apoB mRNA editing, implicating a direct functional role of the protein in apoB mRNA editing. ABBP-2 binds to Hsp70 and displays ATPase activity. These are unique functions for an auxiliary protein; they provide a link between apobec-1 and the chaperone protein Hsp70. Moreover, we showed that low basal levels of ATP are required for efficient RNA editing in vitro. This ATP requirement had been overlooked previously, because the amount of endogenous ATP present in different tissue extracts is sufficient to keep the ABBP-2·Hsp70·apobec-1 complex intact, which seems to be important for the editing activity of such extracts.In addition to complementing the enzymatic activity of apobec-1, ABBP-2 may be an important determinant of the subcellular localization of apobec-1. GFP-ABBP-2 fusion protein is distributed both inside the cytosolic as well as the nuclear compartments, with a preference toward the latter compartment. Through its interaction with Hsp70, it may be part of the cellular machinery that partakes in the assembly and disassembly and the cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of the editosome complex. Recent evidence suggests that the predominantly nuclear localization of apobec-1 is not mediated by any autonomous trafficking signals within its primary sequence (47Yang Y. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Rather the subcellular distribution of apobec-1 may be modulated by one or more auxiliary proteins that also function as chaperonins. We propose that the ABBP-2/Hsp70 system may play such a role. The Hsp70 class of chaperones plays a diverse role in cell physiology (1Mallouk Y. Vayssier-Taussat M. Bonventre J.V. Polla B.S. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 4: 463-474PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hartl F.U.

They participate in different processes, including protein translation, translocation, folding, and the assembly and disassembly of protein complexes. In many cases, the specificity of Hsp70 interaction with their substrates is conferred by the DnaJ class of co-chaperones (4Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The binding of Hsp70s to their target polypeptides is ATP hydrolysis-dependent. ATP-bound Hsp70 has a relatively low affinity for its substrate, primarily because of a high off rate, whereas ADP-bound Hsp70 has a high affinity, due to its lower off rate (5Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp70s is extremely weak, and co-chaperones such as DnaJs are essential to Hsp70 action by stimulating ATP hydrolysis. Furthermore, some DnaJ proteins associate directly with substrate polypeptides, which they then transfer to Hsp70 (6Frydman J. Nimmesgern E. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U.

Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar): an N-terminal ∼70-amino acid J domain, which includes a highly conserved HPD tripeptide, a neighboring G/F domain rich in glycine and phenylalanine residues, a cysteine-rich zinc finger domain, followed by a poorly conserved C-terminal domain (13Huang K. Flanagan J.M. Prestegard J.H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Suh W.C. Lu C.Z. Gross C.A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The J domain is the defining feature of DnaJ proteins. The DnaJ/Hsp40 class of proteins is divided into three subgroups based on the presence or absence of domains other than the J domain: Class I DnaJ/Hsp40s possess all the other three domains present in DnaJ. Class II DnaJ/Hsp40s lack the zinc finger domain. Class III DnaJ/Hsp40s contain the J domain as the only conserved structure. The defining J domain plays an important role in the interaction between DnaJ proteins and their Hsp70 partners (8Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol.

The solution structures of the J domains of E. coli DnaJ and the mammalian Hsp40 protein Hdj1 have been solved by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (17Hill R.B. Flanagan J.M. Prestegard J.H.

Despite the fact that there is only a 54% sequence similarity between the two J domains, their tertiary structures are remarkably similar. Both consist of four α-helices. Helices II and III are antiparallel. Hydrophobic residues on the amphipathic interior surfaces of helices I, II, and III define the core and stabilize the structure of the J domain (4Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The amino acids on the outer surface of helices II and III, including the connecting loop that contains the HPD tripeptide, are thought to be important in determining the affinity and specificity of binding of the J domain to its Hsp70 partner (16Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 18Pellecchia M. Szyperski T. Wall D. Georgopoulos C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol.

Commun. 2001; 282: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); ABBP-1 contains two copies, and ACF and GRY-RBP, each three copies, of RRM. The fact that these auxiliary factors are RNA-binding proteins suggests that they may be involved in anchoring and presenting the substrate mRNA to apobec-1 within the editosome complex for editing. Although, like other complementation proteins studied to date, ABBP-2 also displays apobec-1-binding activity, it is the only auxiliary protein identified to date that does not contain any known RNA-binding motif. Furthermore, as a DnaJ protein, it is the only auxiliary protein that belongs to a family of co-chaperone proteins. ABBP-2 is a Class II DnaJ homologue and is a member of the Hsp40 group of co-chaperonins. The J domain of ABBP-2, together with the neighboring G/F domain, is essential for apobec-1 binding. We showed that, in cultured mammalian cells, down-regulation of ABBP-2 inhibits apoB mRNA editing, implicating a direct functional role of the protein in apoB mRNA editing. ABBP-2 binds to Hsp70 and displays ATPase activity. These are unique functions for an auxiliary protein; they provide a link between apobec-1 and the chaperone protein Hsp70. Moreover, we showed that low basal levels of ATP are required for efficient RNA editing in vitro. This ATP requirement had been overlooked previously, because the amount of endogenous ATP present in different tissue extracts is sufficient to keep the ABBP-2·Hsp70·apobec-1 complex intact, which seems to be important for the editing activity of such extracts. In addition to complementing the enzymatic activity of apobec-1, ABBP-2 may be an important determinant of the subcellular localization of apobec-1. GFP-ABBP-2 fusion protein is distributed both inside the cytosolic as well as the nuclear compartments, with a preference toward the latter compartment. Through its interaction with Hsp70, it may be part of the cellular machinery that partakes in the assembly and disassembly and the cytoplasmic-nuclear translocation of the editosome complex. Recent evidence suggests that the predominantly nuclear localization of apobec-1 is not mediated by any autonomous trafficking signals within its primary sequence (47Yang Y. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Rather the subcellular distribution of apobec-1 may be modulated by one or more auxiliary proteins that also function as chaperonins. We propose that the ABBP-2/Hsp70 system may play such a role."

Although simultaneous CD19 and BCR engagement significantly enhanced CD19/Lyn complex formation and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses, downstream tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 and multiple other cellular proteins was inhibited, as was SHP1 recruitment to phosphorylated CD22. CD19 overexpression also enhanced BCR-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses, but down-regulated tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 and multiple other cellular proteins following BCR ligation. Because CD19 and Lyn expression are genetically titrated in B cells, CD19 engagement may augment BCR-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses by sequestering the available pool of functional Lyn away from downstream negative regulatory proteins such as CD22. Consistent with this, simultaneous CD19 engagement did not further enhance the BCR-induced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> responses of Lyn- or CD22-deficient B cells. Thus, CD19 recruitment of Lyn may preferentially activate selective signaling pathways downstream of the CD19/Lyn complex to the exclusion of other downstream regulatory and effector pathways. Other receptors may also utilize a similar strategy to regulate kinase availability and downstream intermolecular signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1554135744,"IQGAP1 contains a number of protein recognition motifs through which it binds to targets. Several in vitro studies have documented that IQGAP1 interacts directly with calmodulin, actin, E-cadherin, β-catenin, and the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac.

Using a novel assay to evaluate in vivo function of IQGAP1, we document here that microinjection of IQGAP1 into early Xenopus embryos generates superficial ectoderm lesions at late blastula stages.

Deletion of the CHD (IQGAP1-ΔCHD; amino acids 35–265 deleted) was performed by digesting full-length IQGAP1 withBam HI and inserting the resultant 2.6-kilobase (kb)Bam HI-Bam HI fragment into pBluescript-KS at theBam HI site. This construct, named pBluescript-IQN, was cut with Blp I and Aat II and a 4.85-kb fragment was purified from low melting agarose, blunted with T4 polymerase, and self-ligated. The construct was named pBluescript-IQN-ΔCHD. Deletion of the WW region (IQGAP1-ΔWW; amino acids 643–744 deleted) was performed by cutting pBluescript-IQN with Msc I and partially digesting with Dra I. Blunt ends were generated with T4 polymerase. A 5.24-kb fragment was purified from low melting agarose and self-ligated. The construct was named pBluescript-IQN-ΔWW. The Bam HI-Bam HI fragments of pBluescript-IQN-ΔCHD and pBluescript-IQN-ΔWW were re-inserted into pcDNA3-IQGAP1, and clones with the right orientation were selected. IQGAP1 lacking the GRD (IQGAP1-ΔGRD; amino acids 1122–1324 deleted) was prepared by cutting the IQGAP1 pcDNA3 withBsp E1, generating blunt ends with S1 nuclease and cutting with Nhe I. Blunt ends were generated with Klenow and a 10.35-kb fragment was isolated from low melting agarose gel and self-ligated. The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by both restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. All mutants migrated to the predicted region on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 B). Plasmids were purified with a QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C humidified incubator. Transient transfections of wild type or mutant IQGAP1 were performed with Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, CHO cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in a 100-mm dish. Fugene 6 (6 μl) was mixed with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and added to the cells. After 48 h, cells were harvested, lysed, and processed as described below. CHO cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (145 mm NaC1, 12 mm Na2HPO4, and 4 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2), lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaC1, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (buffer A) with 1 mm CaC12 or 1 mm EGTA and quick-frozen in methanol/solid CO2. Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and precleared with protein A-Sepharose. Protein concentrations were measured, equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-IQGAP1 antiserum (16Li Z. Kim S.H. Higgins J.M.G. Brenner M.B. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

After sedimentation by centrifugation, samples were washed five times with buffer A, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride. Blots were probed with anti-IQGAP1 (16Li Z.

Embryonic lysates were prepared by homogenization of microinjected embryos cultured until stages 10–10+ (ten embryos per 200 μl of buffer A). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and processed for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as described above. Capped synthetic mRNAs were transcribed in vitro from linearized plasmid DNA with SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase (25Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) using mMESSAGE mMACHINE kits (Ambion, Austin, TX) following the manufacturer's instructions. The wild type and mutant IQGAP1 mRNAs were linearized with Sma I and synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase. Myc-tagged dominant negative forms of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42-N19RhoA, N17Rac1, and N17Cdc42, respectively, and constitutively active Cdc42 (L61Cdc42) (26Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Alan Hall (University College of London). The Rho family plasmids were linearized with Dra III and transcribed with SP6 polymerase. All RNAs were evaluated and quantified by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) prior to microinjection. Eggs and embryos were obtained from Xenopus females and cultured in 0.1× Marc’s modified Ringer solution as described (28Newport J. Kirschner M. Cell. 1982; 30: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Embryonic stages were determined according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (29Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). North Holland Publishers, Amsterdam1967Google Scholar). For microinjection, embryos were transferred to 3% Ficoll 400 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.5× Marc’s modified Ringer solution and injected at the 4–8 cell stage with 10 nl of a solution containing 2–4 ng of IQGAP1 RNAs, or Rho family RNAs, unless specified otherwise. Injections were carried out in two opposite animal pole blastomeres for morphological and biochemical analysis. Data represent the results obtained from at least three independent experiments. Active Cdc42 was measured with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion construct of the GTPase binding domain (GBD) of WASP as described previously (24Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, each blastomere of four-cell embryos was injected with 4 ng of either wild type IQGAP1 or IQGAP1-ΔGRD mRNAs, and embryos were cultured until stage 10+. Lysates prepared from equal size experimental groups (ten embryos/200 μl of buffer A) were incubated with 5 μg of GST-WASP-GBD for 2 h at 4 °C. Complexes were collected with glutathione-Sepharose, washed, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The resultant Western blots were probed with anti-Cdc42 antibody (24Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). ECL signals were analyzed by densitometry and quantified with NIH Image. Statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t test with InStat software (GraphPad Software, Inc). Protein concentrations were measured with the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). To gain insight into IQGAP1 functions, we synthesized mRNA encoding full-length IQGAP1 protein and injected it into Xenopus early embryos, a rapidin vivo model for gene expression. Injected embryos developed normally until midblastula stages, when compared with uninjected controls (Fig. 1). At mid-late blastula stages, depigmentation of embryonic blastomeres was observed around the injection site, suggesting that pigment granules lost their cortical localization due to rearrangement of cytoskeletal structure (30Merriam R.W. Sauterer R.A. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1983; 76: 51-65PubMed Google Scholar). By gastrulation, the animal hemisphere of injected embryos developed ectodermal lesions, in which cells appeared to have lost adhesion (Fig. 1). These lesions were observed in the majority of injected embryos (77%, n = 92). By contrast, control uninjected embryos and embryos injected with LacZ RNA developed normally (Fig. 1, n = 150, and data not shown). The observed morphological abnormalities of embryos overexpressing IQGAP1 reflect an in vivo activity of IQGAP1 and provide a novel functional assay. To identify the target that mediated the IQGAP1 effect on embryonic ectoderm, we generated a series of mutant forms of IQGAP1 (Fig.2 A). All of the major identified protein interaction motifs and the C-terminal tail of IQGAP1 were individually deleted. The ability of these mutant constructs to bind endogenous Cdc42 was examined. CHO cells were transiently transfected with IQGAP1, and equal amounts of cell lysate were immunoprecipitated. As demonstrated previously (13Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), Cdc42 co-immunoprecipitated with wild-type IQGAP1 (Fig. 2 B). Deletion of the CHD or WW domains did not alter binding of Cdc42 to IQGAP1. By contrast, Cdc42 binding was essentially abolished by deleting the IQ domain, the GRD, or the C-terminal region of IQGAP1 (Fig. 2 B). Because endogenous IQGAP1 concentrations in CHO cells are low, the amount of recombinant IQGAP1 is severalfold higher than the endogenous protein (Fig. 2 C, compare vector and IQGAP1-transfected samples). To define which domain of IQGAP1 is critical for its functional activity in embryonic ectoderm, we tested the ability of different mutated forms of IQGAP1 to induce ectodermal lesions. RNA microinjections revealed that deletion of the CHD or WW domains did not alter the activity of IQGAP1 (n = 70 and n = 62, respectively), whereas deletion of the IQ domain, the GRD, or the C terminus of IQGAP1 completely abrogated its activity in early embryos (Fig. 3 A, n = 61, 76, and 49, respectively). To ensure that the injected mRNA was translated into protein, after microinjection embryos were lysed and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting revealed that all of the IQGAP1 constructs were expressed (Fig. 3 B). Probing the blots for actin verified that equal amounts of protein lysate were loaded on the gel (Fig. 3 B). These findings confirm that the indicated IQGAP1 mutants, although present, did not have a functional effect. Importantly, the constructs that lost functional activity are the same constructs that no longer bind Cdc42 (Fig. 2 B). This result indicates that the binding of Cdc42 is essential for the functional activity of IQGAP1 in the embryos. Comparison of mutant constructs suggested that the property of IQGAP1 required to produce ectodermal lesions may be the modulation of the activities of the Rho family GTPases in early embryos. To address this hypothesis, we compared the amount of active Cdc42 that binds GST-WASP-GBD (24Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36999-37005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) in embryos injected with the wild type or mutant IQGAP1. Since GST-WASP-GBD binds only GTP-bound Cdc42, the amount of bound Cdc42 reflects the relative amount of active Cdc42 in the lysate (24Kim S.H. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

Injection of mRNA for wild type IQGAP1 augmented the amount of active Cdc42 in embryo lysates by 41% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, IQGAP1-ΔGRD did not increase the amount of active Cdc42. This result indicates that overexpression of IQGAP1 increases the amount of active Cdc42 in the embryo and is consistent with our earlier observation that wild type IQGAP1 down-regulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Cdc42 in vitro (13Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We next tested the hypothesis that the effect of IQGAP1 on embryonic ectoderm is due to activation of endogenous Cdc42. This was evaluated by co-injecting dominant negative forms of Rho family proteins, namely N19Rho, N17Rac1, or N17Cdc42 (26Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3747) Google Scholar), with wild type IQGAP1 (Fig.5 A). Consistent with the failure of IQGAP1 to bind RhoA (10Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), N19Rho did not have the effect on the morphology or frequency of ectodermal lesions triggered by IQGAP1. Lesions were observed in 80–95% of embryos co-injected with N19Rho and IQGAP1 RNAs (n = 65). Although Rac1 binds to IQGAP1 (10Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), N17Rac1 did not attenuate the effect of IQGAP1 (n = 82). By contrast, co-injection of N17Cdc42 almost completely abrogated the change in Xenopus animal pole cells elicited by IQGAP1. Small lesions formed in less than one-quarter of injected embryos, whereas others developed normally (n = 78, Fig. 5 A). Injection of the same doses of N19Rho, N17Rac1, or N17Cdc42 without IQGAP1 did not have a significant effect on normal embryonic development (data not shown). Biochemical analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of the dominant negative Rho constructs on the amount of active Cdc42. In agreement with the morphological data, N17Cdc42 abrogated the increase in GTP-Cdc42 formation produced by microinjection of IQGAP1 (Fig.4 B). By contrast, N19Rho and N17Rac1 did not attenuate the increase in active Cdc42 observed in cells microinjected with IQGAP1. The dominant band in the Western blot of total Cdc42 (Fig.4 B, lane 2) is the injected N17Cdc42 construct. Longer exposure of the blot revealed that equal amounts of total Cdc42 were present in all the samples (data not shown). To verify that the Rho family mRNAs were translated into protein, aliquots of embryo lysates were subjected to Western blotting. Probing the blots with anti-Myc antibody revealed the expression of the dominant negative Rac, Cdc42, and Rho proteins (Fig. 5 B). Inspection of the blots also verified that injected IQGAP1 protein was expressed in the embryos and that equal amounts of protein lysate were loaded on the gel (Fig. 5 B, top and middle panels, respectively). Note that IQGAP1 is not detectable in the Western blots from uninjected embryos (Fig. 4 A). The anti-IQGAP1 antibody, which was generated using the N-terminal region (amino acids 1–863) of human IQGAP1 (13Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), may not recognizeXenopus IQGAP1. In this report, we describe the in vivo activity of IQGAP1 overexpressed in early frog embryos. Injection of wild type IQGAP1 into Xenopus early embryos induced changes at the mid-blastula stages, with more dramatic effects evident by gastrulation. Based on the morphological appearance of induced lesions in presumptive ectoderm, IQGAP1 is likely to affect the cytoskeletal architecture and cell adhesion. IQGAP1 interacts with several proteins that could modulate the cytoskeleton, including actin, E-cadherin, β-catenin, Cdc42, and Rac (10Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 13Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol.

All of the IQGAP1 regions that are known to interact with targets or contain domains likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions, e.g. the WW domain, were deleted. The known binding domains are the CHD, actin binding domain (13Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); IQ region, calmodulin-binding domain (13Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); GRD, necessary for Cdc42 and Rac binding (10Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar); and the C-terminal tail, which is required for binding of E-cadherin and β-catenin (14Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Analysis of these mutant IQGAP1 proteins revealed that Cdc42 binding was necessary to produce the phenotype. The specific region of IQGAP1 to which Cdc42 binds has not been identified. In vitro analysis with purified proteins demonstrated that the C-terminal half of IQGAP1 (amino acid residues 864–1657) bound Cdc42, but deletion of the GRD prevented Cdc42 binding (10Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Interestingly, residues in addition to the GRD, particularly near the C terminus, were required for binding of Cdc42 to the recombinant C-terminal half of IQGAP1 (10Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Our data with IQGAP1-ΔGRD and IQGAP1-ΔC extend these observations to reveal that both the GRD and C-terminal region are necessary for binding of intact IQGAP1 to endogenous Cdc42 in a normal cell milieu. Less anticipated was the finding that IQGAP1-ΔIQ was unable to bind Cdc42. Because Ca2+/calmodulin, which binds predominantly to the IQ region of IQGAP1 (13Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), prevents binding of Cdc42 to IQGAP1 (9Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to infer that the N-terminal half of IQGAP1 imparts structural information to the intact protein. Furthermore, the conformation of IQGAP1-ΔIQ is likely to resemble that of wild type IQGAP1 bound to Ca2+/calmodulin. Detailed structural analysis of the IQGAP1 constructs is necessary to validate this hypothesis. Notwithstanding the documentation that IQGAP1 interacts with several proteins that regulate the cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesion, our data identify Cdc42 as an essential component of the effect of IQGAP1 on Xenopus ectoderm. This interpretation is supported by several findings. All deletion mutants of IQGAP1 that bound Cdc42 produced the phenotype, while none of the IQGAP1 deletion mutants that failed to bind Cdc42 elicited a detectable effect. In addition, injection of wild-type IQGAP1, but not IQGAP1-ΔGRD that does not bind Cdc42, significantly increased the amount of active Cdc42 in embryo lysates. Although exhibiting substantial sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of RasGAPs (12Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.E. Yan Y.X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in vitro analysis revealed that IQGAP1 inhibits (rather than increases, as would be anticipated for a GAP) the intrinsic GTPase activity of Cdc42 (13Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 21Zhang B. Wang Z.X. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These observations led Ho et al. (13Ho Y.-D. Joyal J.L. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) to hypothesize that, by maintaining Cdc42 in the active GTP-bound form, IQGAP1 could potentially enhance Cdc42 function in cells. The findings in this work validate that hypothesis. Additional evidence indicating that Cdc42 is required for IQGAP1 function is the demonstration that co-injection of the dominant negative Cdc42 construct, N17Cdc42, abrogated the effect of IQGAP1 onXenopus ectoderm in vivo. Rho, which has pronounced effects on the cytoskeleton (3Mackay D.J.G. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), does not bind to IQGAP1 (10Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, N19Rho did not attenuate the effect of IQGAP1 on the embryo. Moreover, although Rac organizes the cytoskeleton and binds to IQGAP1 (10Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), N17Rac did not modulate the phenotype produced by IQGAP1. Overexpression of L61Cdc42, a constitutively active Cdc42, resulted in a qualitatively different phenotype, suggesting that activation of Cdc42 is not sufficient for the observed IQGAP1 effect. At high doses (100–500 pg), L61Cdc42 RNA blocked cytokinesis, whereas at lower doses (10–40 pg), it had no visible effect on Xenopus ectoderm (data not shown and (31Drechsel D.N. Hyman A.A. Hall A. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 12-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, while our data do not rule out the involvement of other targets of IQGAP1, they clearly indicate that Cdc42 is necessary, but not sufficient, for the IQGAP1-induced phenotype in earlyXenopus embryos. The mechanism by which the interaction between IQGAP1 and Cdc42 generates the phenotype in the Xenopus embryos is not completely understood. At the present time, we have not identified the downstream target(s) that mediate the morphological changes produced by the IQGAP1-Cdc42 complex. IQGAP1, which forms a link between Cdc42 and the actin cytoskeleton (32Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Hart M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24443-24447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), exhibits increased F-actin-cross-linking activity in vitro in response to active Cdc42 (22Fukata M. Kuroda S. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Shoji I. Matsuura Y.Y. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kikuchi A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29579-29583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, multiple effector proteins for Cdc42 have been identified (for review, see Ref. 1Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar), several of which are known to alter cell morphology directly or indirectly. These range from protein kinases to lipid kinases to scaffolding proteins. While many of these targets are effectors for both Rac and Cdc42, some appear to be selective for Cdc42. For example, activation of PAK4, an effector for Cdc42, induces morphological changes and alters cell adhesion (33Qu J. Cammarano M.S. Shi Q. Ha K.C. de Lanerolle P. Minden A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3523-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cdc42 is also implicated in the regulation of cadherin function (14Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T. Nomura N. Tani H. Shoji I. Matsuura Y. Yonehara S. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1998; 281: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar,34Hirsch D.S. Pirone D.M. Burbelo P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 875-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes overexpressing Cdc42 effector proteins had reduced F-actin and E-cadherin at adherens junctions (34Hirsch D.S. Pirone D.M. Burbelo P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 875-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, many questions remain unanswered, and the specific role of Cdc42 in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion is not fully understood (35Braga V. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Regardless of the mechanism, our data establish that IQGAP1 maintains Cdc42 in the active GTP-bound state, culminating in functional sequelae in intact cells.

The interactions between α2M* and growth factors/cytokines/hormones probably play a role in modulating their biological activities since the TGF-β-α2M* interaction is biologically relevant (31Cote N.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1152-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the interactions of α2M* with TGF-β isoforms may provide a good model for understanding the molecular mechanisms of interactions between α2M* and ligand proteins in general. The identification of the binding sites in TGF-β molecules involved in high affinity complex formation with α2M* could elucidate the molecular basis of the complex formation. In this work, we demonstrate that among pentacosapeptides whose amino acid sequences overlapped and spanned the entire TGF-β1molecule, only those containing the residue Trp-52 or Trp-30/Trp-32 blocked 125I-TGF-β1 binding to α2M*. The pentacosapeptide β125, which contains residues 41–65 (β125(41–65)) with the residue Trp-52 in the middle of the peptide, was more potent in inhibiting125I-TGF-β1 binding to α2M* than pentacosapeptides containing Trp-52 near the C terminus or N terminus and those containing Trp-30/Trp-32. The replacement of Trp-52 with alanine abolished this activity. The pentacosapeptide β225(41–65), which contained amino acid residues 41–65 of TGF-β2, and the decapeptides β110(49–58) and β210(49–58), whose amino acid sequences corresponded to residues 49–58 of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2, were also active in blocking125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation. In contrast, the pentacosapeptide β325(41–65), which contained residues 41–65 of TGF-β3, and decapeptide β310(49–58) did not block125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation, but both lacked Trp-52. We also show that125I-TGF-β3 formed complexes with α2M* with low affinity (K d = ∼400 nm), and that unlabeled TGF-β3 and the mutant TGF-β1W52A, in which Trp-52 was replaced with alanine, were both less effective in blocking125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation than unlabeled TGF-β1. Finally, we demonstrate that β125(41–65) and β110(49–58) were also able to block125I-labeled nerve growth factor (125I-NGF) from binding to α2M*. Na125I (17 Ci/mg) was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals (Irvine, CA). Human TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3, and NGF were obtained from Austral Biologicals (San Ramon, CA) and R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Human α2M and α2M* were prepared as described previously (10Huang S.S. O'Grady P. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

Porcine TGF-β1 mutant TGF-β1W52A was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in NIH-3T3 and Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified from the conditioned media according to our published procedures (41Huang S.S. Zhou M. Johnson F.E. Shieh H.-S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27754-27758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of pentacosapeptides and decapeptides were derived from those of human TGF-β1, TGF-β2, and TGF-β3. Pentacosapeptides β125(41–65), β225(41–65), and β325(41–65), and other versions in which cysteine 44 and cysteine 48 were replaced by serine residues were also synthesized. These C44S/C48S versions that had the same activity as the cysteine-containing peptides as measured by the inhibition of125I-TGF-β1 binding to α2M* were used throughout the experiments. Structural variants, in which Trp-52, Ser-53, or Asp-55 were replaced with alanine, scrambled β125(41–65), which contained the scrambled amino acid sequence of residues 41–65 (C44S/C48S) of TGF-β1 (YADNYLGLPVQWKSSYPFLSAISTL), and β125(65–41), which contained residues of 41–65 in reversed sequence, were synthesized to study their structure and function relationship. The peptides were synthesized usingtert-butoxycarbonyl chemistry or Fast-MOC chemistry on an Applied Biosystem Model 431A peptide synthesizer (42Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J.

TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3, and NGF (4–5 μg) were each iodinated with 2 mCi of Na125I using chloramine T according to the procedure of Huang et al. (10Huang S.S. O'Grady P. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

The specific radioactivity of125I-TGF-β1,125I-TGF-β2,125I-TGF-β3, and 125I-NGF was ∼1–5 × 105 cpm/ng in each case. The reaction mixtures contained 5–10 μg of α2M* and ∼1 ng of either125I-TGF-β1,125I-TGF-β2,125I-TGF-β3, or 125I-NGF in 0.05 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, or 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. After 30 min at room temperature, the complex formation of 125I-TGF-β or 125I-NGF and α2M* was determined using 5% nondenaturing PAGE (10Huang S.S. O'Grady P. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1535-1541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. The intensity of the radioactive125I-TGF-β·α2M* or125I-NGF·α2M* complex band was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. The IC50 of inhibition of125I-TGF-β·α2M* or125I-NGF·α2M* complex formation (mean ± S.D.) was determined in 5–8 independent experiments. 125I-TGF-β1 (1 ng) and125I-TGF-β1 (1 ng) preincubated with α2M* (10 μg) in the presence and absence of β125(41–65) (20 μm) at room temperature for 30 min were injected into lateral tail veins of mice anesthetized with ketamine as described previously (43LaMarre J. Hayes M. Wollenberg G. Hussaini I. Hall S. Gonias S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Blood samples (∼ 25 μl) were taken at 10 s, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 min from the retroorbital venous plexus using heparinized hematocrit tubes. The radioactivity in the blood sample obtained at 10 s was taken as 100%. The experiments were performed in triplicate. To determine the potential binding site for α2M* on the TGF-β1 molecule, nine pentacosapeptides with amino acid sequences, which overlapped and covered the entire TGF-β1 molecule, were synthesized and tested for their abilities to inhibit125I-TGF-β1 binding to α2M*, which had been activated by methylamine. Synthetic peptides with amino acid sequences derived from growth factors have successfully been used to identify the receptor binding sites of the growth factor molecules (42Huang S.S. Liu Q.

In this system, the125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex co-migrates with α2M*, whereas free125I-TGF-β1 does not migrate into the separating gel because of its basicity (10Huang S.S. O'Grady P. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1535-1541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, at a concentration of 375 μm, pentacosapeptides β125(21–45), β125(31–55), β125(41–65), and β125(51–75) with amino acid sequences corresponding to amino acid residues 21–45, 31–55, 41–65, and 51–75 of TGF-β1, respectively, effectively inhibited the formation of 125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex. The TGF-β1-derived peptides, which covered other regions of the TGF-β1 molecule, were not active in blocking 125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation. These included β125(61–85), β125(71–95), β125(81–105) (see Fig. 1), β125(1–25), and β125(88–112) (data not shown). The inhibitory pentacosapeptides blocked125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2). The IC50 values were estimated to be 30 ± 7 μm for β125(21–45) (n = 6), 40 ± 20 μm for β125(31–55) (n = 6), 7 ± 3 μm for β125(41–65) (n = 8), and 60 ± 10 μm for β125(51–75) (n = 6). All effective inhibitory peptides contain tryptophan residues (Trp-52 or Trp-30/Trp-32). However, the peptide containing residues 41–65 showed the most potent inhibitory activity.Figure 2Inhibition of the125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation by synthetic TGF-β1 pentacosapeptides containing Trp-52 and Trp-30/Trp-32. 5 μg of α2M* was reacted with 1 ng of 125I-TGF-β1 in the presence of various concentrations of β125(31–55), β125(41–65), β125(51–75), and β125(21–45).

The arrow andarrowhead indicate the location of the125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex and dye front, respectively. B, the intensity of the125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. The intensity of the125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formed in the absence of TGF-β1 pentacosapeptides was taken as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further define the biological relevance of the peptide inhibition of125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation in a whole-animal system, we determined the plasma clearance of free 125I-TGF-β1 and125I-TGF-β1 preincubated with α2M* in the presence and absence of β125(41–65) in mice. Intravenously injected-free 125I-TGF-β1 and125I-TGF-β·α2M* complexes are known to be cleared from the circulation at different rates (half-time =t 1/2) in mice (43LaMarre J. Hayes M. Wollenberg G. Hussaini I. Hall S. Gonias S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Whether β125(41–65) inhibits the complex formation of 125I-TGF-β and α2M*, thet 1/2 of 125I-TGF-β preincubated with α2M* in the presence of β125(41–65) should be similar to that of free 125I-TGF-β1. As shown in Fig.3, this proved to be the case witht 1/2 = 1.6 ± 0.1 min essentially identical to that of free 125I-TGF-β1. Thet 1/2 of 125I-TGF-β1preincubated with α2M* in the absence of β125(41–65) was 3.3 ± 0.1 min, which was comparable to the reported value for the125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex (43LaMarre J. Hayes M. Wollenberg G. Hussaini I. Hall S. Gonias S. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This result indicates that β125(41–65) inhibits the complex formation of 125I-TGF-β1and α2M* in a standard whole-animal model. As shown in Fig. 2, β125(41–65), which contained Trp-52 in the middle, was more effective in inhibiting125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation than β125(31–55) and β125(51–75), which contained Trp-52 near the C terminus and N terminus, respectively. This finding implies that Trp-52 may play a role in the inhibitory activities of the peptides. To test this possibility, we synthesized pentacosapeptides β125(41–65)W52A, in which Trp-52 was replaced with alanine, scrambled β125(41–65), in which the amino acid sequence of residues 41–65 was random, and β125(65–41), which contained the reversed sequence of residues 41–65. They had no effect on125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation (data not shown). To further define the role of Trp-52 in the inhibitory activities of various synthetic TGF-β peptides, we determined the effects of decapeptides β110(49–58), β210(49–58), and β310(49–58) on125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation. Both β110(49–58) and β210(49–58) contained Trp-52, whereas β310(49–58) possessed Arg-52 instead. As shown in Fig. 4, both β110(49–58) and β210(49–58) had equal potency in inhibiting125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation with IC50 values of ∼200 ± 20 μm (n = 5) and 190 ± 25 μm (n = 5), respectively. In contrast, β310(49–58) was inactive. Increasing the peptide length in β325(41–65) did not improve its inability to block125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation (data not shown). Replacement of Trp-52 with alanine in β110(49–58) abolished the inhibitory activity. Replacement of Asp-55 with alanine in β110(49–58) enhanced the inhibitory activity (IC50 = 100 ± 10 μm), but the replacement of Ser-53 with alanine in β110(49–58)S53A diminished the inhibitory activity (IC50 = >1000 μm). These results suggest that Trp-52 is important for the inhibitory activities of synthetic TGF-β peptides containing Trp-52, and that alteration of the amino acid sequence near residue 52 also affects activity in some instances. Because synthetic growth factor peptide antagonists or inhibitors often contain active-site amino acid residues (42Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 44Engström U. Engström A. Ernlund A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16581-16587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the Trp-52 residue is involved in the high affinity binding of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 to α2M*. To test this hypothesis, we determined the affinity of125I-labeled TGF-β3(125I-TGF-β3) binding to α2M*. If the Trp-52 residue is involved in the high affinity binding of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 to α2M*,125I-TGF-β3 should show weaker binding to α2M* than TGF-β1 and TGF-β2, because it has an arginine residue instead of tryptophan at position 52. As shown in Fig. 5,125I-TGF-β3 bound to α2M* in a concentration-dependent manner. Scatchard plot analysis of this binding data revealed an apparent K d of 400 nm of 125I-TGF-β3 binding to α2M*. In the control experiment, the apparentK d of 125I-TGF-β1 binding to α2M* was estimated to be ∼54 nm. This result is comparable to the reported K d value of125I-TGF-β1 binding (21Gonias S.L. LaMarre J. Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Lopes M.B. Moses H.L. Hayes M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 273-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This finding shows that TGF-β3 binds to α2M* with an affinity lower than those of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2. TGF-β2 has been shown to bind to α2M* with an affinity 10-fold higher than that of TGF-β1 (21Gonias S.L. LaMarre J. Crookston K.P. Webb D.J. Wolf B.B. Lopes M.B. Moses H.L. Hayes M.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 737: 273-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because TGF-β1 isoforms share ∼70% amino acid sequence homology, it is possible that amino acid residues other than Trp-52 also contribute to the high affinity binding of TGF-β1 to α2M*. To test this possibility, we prepared the TGF-β1 mutant TGF-β1W52A in which Trp-52 was replaced by alanine by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (41Huang S.S. Zhou M. Johnson F.E. Shieh H.-S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27754-27758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and then determined the effect of 200-fold excess TGF-β1W52A on125I-TGF-β1 binding to α2M*. As shown in Fig. 6, lanes 2 and3, unlabeled TGF-β3 and TGF-β1W52A only partially inhibited binding (∼15–25%) of 125I-TGF-β1 to α2M* even at 200-fold excess concentration. In contrast, unlabeled TGF-β1 completely blocked125I-TGF-β1 binding to α2M* at a 200-fold excess concentration (Fig. 6, lane 1). This result suggests that Trp-52 is important for high affinity binding of TGF-β1 to α2M*. TGF-β and other growth factors/cytokines/hormones compete for binding to α2M* (28Gonias S.L. Carmichael A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5826-5831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding site(s) in α2M for these proteins may be the same or overlapping. The lack of homology of amino acid sequences and differences in three-dimensional structures among these growth factors/cytokines/hormones further suggests that they may bind to α2M via a mechanism that is dependent on surface topology, e.g. specific hydrophobic regions in the molecules. Because NGF is known to compete with TGF-β for binding to α2M* (28Gonias S.L. Carmichael A. Meltenburg J.M. Roadmap D.W. Irvin W.P. Webb D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5826-5831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we determined the effect of the synthetic TGF-β peptides on 125I-NGF binding to α2M*. As shown in Fig. 7, β125(41–65), β110(49–58), and β210(49–58) inhibited 125I-NGF binding to α2M* with IC50 values of 35 ± 10 μm (n = 5), 250 ± 15 μm (n = 5), and 260 ± 20 μm (n = 5), respectively. The pentacosapeptide β125(21–45), which contained Trp-30/Trp-32, inhibited complex formation of125I-NGF and α2M* with an IC50 of 300 ± 20 μm (n = 5). β110(49–58)W52A and β310(49–58) were inactive in inhibiting complex formation of 125I-TGF-β1 and α2M*. These results suggest that although these synthetic TGF-β peptides are less active inhibitors of 125I-NGF binding to α2M* than those of125I-TGF-β1 binding to α2M*, the residue Trp-52 is essential in both cases. In this study, we present several lines of evidence suggesting that the residue Trp-52 is involved in the high affinity binding of TGF-β1 to α2M*. Such evidence include: 1) among nine synthetic pentacosapeptides whose amino acid sequences overlap and span the entire TGF-β1 molecule, β125(41–65), which contains Trp-52 in the middle of the peptide, exhibited the most potent activity in inhibiting125I-TGF-β1 binding to α2M* as determined by nondenaturing PAGE and by plasma clearance, 2) β225(41–65) was as effective as β125(41–65) in blocking125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation, whereas β325(41–65), which lacks Trp-52, scrambled β125(41–65), which contains the scrambled amino acid sequence of residues 41–65, and β125(65–41), which contains the reversed sequence of residues 41–65, were inactive, 3) β110(49–58) and β210(49–58), both of which contain Trp-52, effectively blocked 125I-TGF-β1 binding to α2M*, whereas β325(49–58), which contains Arg-52 instead of Trp-52, was not active, 4) the replacement of Trp-52 with alanine completely abolished the activities of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 peptides containing Trp-52, 5) 125I-TGF-β3, which lacks Trp-52, weakly bound to α2M* with an apparentK d of ∼400 nm, and 6) unlabeled TGF-β3 and the mutant TGF-β1W52A were less effective in blocking 125I-TGF-β1binding to α2M* than unlabeled TGF-β1. The residue Trp-52 appears to be critical for high affinity binding of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 to α2M*. We also show that Trp-30/Trp-32 in residues 21–45 may be involved in the low affinity binding of TGF-β3 and TGF-β1W52A to α2M*. Using synthetic peptides with amino acid sequences derived from TGF-β1, the motif WSLD (amino acid residues 52–55) has been recently identified as an active site of TGF-β1, which modulates growth inhibition of epithelial cells and growth stimulation of fibroblasts (41Huang S.S. Zhou M. Johnson F.E. Shieh H.-S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27754-27758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The synthetic TGF-β1pentacosapeptide β125(41–65), which contains the motif in the middle of the peptide, exhibits potent TGF-β antagonist activities. However, the structural requirements of this peptide for its TGF-β antagonist activity (42Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and for its activity in blocking 125I-TGF-β1 binding to α2M* are different in two aspects. First, Asp-55 is required for its TGF-β antagonist activity but not for its ability to block 125I-TGF-β1 binding to α2M* (42Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Replacement of Asp-55 with alanine diminishes its TGF-β antagonist activity (42Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but enhances its ability to block125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation. Second, β125(31–55) and β125(51–75), which contain the WSLD motif at the C and N termini, respectively, are inactive as TGF-β antagonists (42Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but effective in blocking125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation. In addition, β125(21–45), which contains Trp-30/Trp-32, does not exhibit TGF-β antagonist activity (42Huang S.S. Liu Q. Johnson F.E. Konish Y. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27155-27159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but effectively blocks125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms of the interactions of TGF-β1 with cellular receptors and α2M* are different, even though Trp-52 is involved in both types of interaction. α2M* is known to interact with TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 with different affinities. The affinity of TGF-β2 for binding to α2M* is ∼10 times higher than that of TGF-β1. Burmester et al.(45Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Roberts A.B. Huang A. Amatayakul-Chantler S. Suardet L. Odartchenko N. Madri J.A. Sporn M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8628-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reported that amino acid residues Ala-45 and Ala-47 were important for high affinity binding of TGF-β2 to α2M*, and that by replacing residues 45 and 47 of TGF-β2 with the corresponding amino acids (Leu-45 and Pro-47) of TGF-β1, the binding of TGF-β to α2M was markedly reduced (45Burmester J.K. Qian S.W. Roberts A.B. Huang A. Amatayakul-Chantler S. Suardet L. Odartchenko N. Madri J.A. Sporn M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8628-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that Ala-45 and Ala-47 may play important roles in maintaining the conformation of the nearby structural determinant responsible for high affinity binding of TGF-β2 to α2M*, which includes Trp-52 and neighboring residues. The rotation angles of residues 49–51 in TGF-β2 are distinctly different from the angles of the corresponding residues in TGF-β1(37Hinck A.P. Archer S.J. Qian S.W. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B.

Furthermore, the area around Trp-52 in TGF-β2is more hydrophobic than in TGF-β1 (Fig.8, white areas). The surface structures of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2encompassing the areas surrounding Trp-52 appear to be different. It is probable that this difference in the tertiary structure around Trp-52 may affect hydrophobicity and thus contribute to the different affinities of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 for binding to α2M*. It important to note that β125(41–65) and β225(41–65) have equal potency in blocking125I-TGF-β1·α2M* complex formation, suggesting that the three-dimensional configuration at and around Trp-52 is an especially important determinant of the affinities of TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 binding to α2M*. We hypothesize that TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 form complexes with α2M* through the interaction of the hydrophobic region at and around Trp-52 in TGF-β molecules and a specific hydrophobic region of α2M*. It has been shown that the hydrophobicity is increased after conversion of native α2M to α2M* by treatment with protease or methylamine (46Birkenmeier G. Kopperschlager G. Methods in Enzymol. 1994; 228: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1580878352,"Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1, also known as NKX2.1 and T/EBP), a transcription factor belonging to the NKX-2 family of homeodomain-containing genes, plays an essential role in the organogenesis of the thyroid gland, lung, and ventral forebrain. Nestin is an intermediate filament protein strongly expressed in multipotential neuroepithelial stem cells and rapidly down-regulated during postnatal life. Here we show that stable fibroblastic clones expressing TTF-1 acquire a phenotype reminiscent of neuroepithelial cells in culture and up-regulate the endogenous nestin gene. TTF-1 transactivates in HeLa and NIH3T3 cells a reporter gene driven by a central nervous system-specific enhancer element from the second intron of the rat nestin gene, where it recognizes a DNA-binding site (NestBS) whose sequence resembles a nuclear hormone/cAMP-responsive element very different from canonical TTF-1 binding sites. Nuclear extracts from the head of mouse embryos form a retarded complex with NestBS of the same mobility of the extracts obtained from TTF1-expressing clones, which is either abolished or supershifted in the presence of two different antibodies recognizing the TTF-1 protein. Thus, the neuroepithelial marker nestin is a direct central nervous system-specific target gene of TTF-1, leading to the hypothesis that it might be the effector through which TTF-1 plays its role in the organogenesis of the forebrain."
https://openalex.org/W2053877115,"Thrombin possesses two positively charged surface domains, termed exosites, that orient substrates and inhibitors for reaction with the enzyme. Because the exosites also allosterically modulate thrombin's activity, we set out to determine whether the structure or function of the exosites changes when thrombin forms complexes with antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, or α1-antitrypsin (M358R), serpins that utilize both, one, or neither of the exosites, respectively. Using a hirudin-derived peptide to probe the integrity of exosite 1, no binding was detected when thrombin was complexed with heparin cofactor II or α1-antitrypsin (M358R), and the peptide exhibited a 55-fold lower affinity for the thrombin-antithrombin complex than for thrombin. Bound peptide or HD-1, an exosite 1-binding DNA aptamer, was displaced from thrombin by each of the three serpins. Thrombin binding to fibrin also was abrogated when the enzyme was complexed with serpins. These data reveal that, regardless of the initial mode of interaction, the function of exosite 1 is lost when thrombin is complexed by serpins. In contrast, the integrity of exosite 2 is largely retained when thrombin is complexed by serpins, because interaction with heparin or an exosite 2-directed DNA aptamer was only modestly altered.

To prevent excessive clotting, the activity of thrombin must be tightly regulated (1Colman R.W. Clowes A.W. George J.N. Marder V.J. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Clowes A.W. George J.N. Hemostasis and Thrombosis. Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 3-16Google Scholar). Down-regulation of thrombin activity is mediated by two serpins, antithrombin and heparin cofactor II, which form 1:1 stoichiometric complexes with thrombin (2Bock S.C. Colman R.W. Hirsh J. Marder V.J. Clowes A.W. George J.N. Hemostasis and Thrombosis. Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 321-334Google Scholar). Another inhibitory mechanism involves thrombomodulin, a thrombin receptor found on the surface of vascular endothelial cells. Once bound to thrombomodulin, thrombin undergoes a specificity change that converts it from a procoagulant enzyme into one that initiates an anticoagulant pathway by activating protein C (3Esmon C.T.

Selective interactions of thrombin with its substrates, cofactors, and inhibitors reflect structural characteristics unique to thrombin. These structural features include two surface loops that limit access to the active site by protruding over the active site cleft. In addition, thrombin possesses two positively charged domains, termed exosites, located on opposite poles of the thrombin molecule (4Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 5Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 6Di Cera E.

The principal role of exosite 1 is to bind substrates, cofactors, and inhibitors and orient them for optimal interaction with the active site. This exosite, which also is known as the fibrinogen recognition site (7Fenton J.W.I. Olson T.A. Zabinski M.P. Wilner G.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7106-7112Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), interacts with negatively charged domains on fibrinogen, the thrombin receptor, hirudin, thrombomodulin, and heparin cofactor II. In contrast, the other exosite, which is designated exosite 2, binds heparin, dermatan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate, glycosaminoglycans that promote thrombin's interactions with serine protease inhibitors and thrombomodulin. In addition to mediating thrombin's interactions with its substrates and inhibitors, the exosites also modulate thrombin's activity. By binding to exosite 1, in a concerted interaction that also involves exosite 2, thrombomodulin abolishes the procoagulant activity of thrombin by hindering its reaction with fibrinogen, factors V and VIII, and the thrombin receptor (8Esmon C.T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 23632-23636Google Scholar). Furthermore, ligand binding to either exosite can influence the other exosite in a reciprocal fashion (14Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Exosite 2 contributes to the inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin and heparin cofactor II by serving as a heparin-binding site, thereby promoting heparin-mediated bridging of the enzyme to the inhibitor (16Olson S.T. Björk I. Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 1994; 20: 373-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,17Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Exosite 1 also plays an important role in the interaction of thrombin with heparin cofactor II. Binding of heparin or dermatan sulfate to heparin cofactor II disrupts the intramolecular interaction of the NH2-terminal domain, allowing it to bridge to exosite 1 on thrombin (17Tollefsen D.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 74: 1209-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Liaw P.C. Austin R.C. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27597-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The exosites are not essential for thrombin inactivation, however, because α1-antitrypsin Pittsburgh, a naturally occurring variant with its reactive site P1 residue, Met-358, replaced with Arg (M358R), has no requirement for interaction with either exosite (19Owen M.C. Brennan S.O. Lewis J.H. Carrell R.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 20Bischoff R. Speck D. Lepage P. Delatre L. Ledoux C. Brown S.W. Roitsch C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3464-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because antithrombin, heparin cofactor II and α1-antitrypsin M358R have different requirements for access to the exosites on thrombin, we set out to elucidate the structural integrity of exosites 1 and 2 when thrombin is complexed by these serpins. This study extends a previous report that exosite 1 is no longer accessible to a hirudin-derived peptide once thrombin is complexed by antithrombin (21Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Bjork I. J. Biol.

The exosite 1- and 2-directed oligonucleotides HD-1 and HD-22, respectively, were synthesized with fluorescein at the 5′-end by the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, McMaster University, based on the sequences reported by Bock et al.

Phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles were prepared as described previously (24Bloom J.W. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4419-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). 1 mCi of Na125I (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Markham, Ontario) was incubated with one IODO-BEAD (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. The bead was removed, and 200 μg of thrombin was added to the buffer containing Na125I. After 10-min incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of sodium metabisulfite to 40 mm, and the sample was applied to a PD-10 column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TS), containing 0.01% Tween 20 and 0.6% polyethylene glycol 8000. The column was eluted under gravity, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Based on absorbance at 280 nm and radioactivity, fractions containing125I-thrombin were identified and pooled, and the concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (14Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The specific activity of thrombin radiolabeled in this fashion was 5 × 108 cpm/mg. Complexes of thrombin with antithrombin or heparin cofactor II were prepared by incubating a 10–20% molar excess of inhibitor over enzyme in the absence or presence of 1–5 nm heparin. Complexes of thrombin with α1-antitrypsin M358R were prepared in the absence of heparin. After 60-min incubation of thrombin with serpin, no residual thrombin activity was detected using the thrombin-directed chromogenic substrate, tGPR-pNA. Aliquots of reaction mixtures also were subjected to PAGE analysis on 4–15% polyacrylamide gels (Ready Gels, Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario) in the presence of SDS to confirm the formation of thrombin-inhibitor complexes (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). Complexes of 125I-thrombin with FPRck or serpins were prepared in the absence of glycosaminoglycans by incubating 2–5 μm125I-thrombin with 2- to 5-fold molar excess FPRck, antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, or α1-antitrypsin M358R. After incubation for 60 min at 23 °C, the residual activity of thrombin with tGPR-pNA was determined. The complex with heparin cofactor II showed 98% inhibition of chromogenic activity, whereas the others demonstrated greater than 99.5% inhibition. Concentrations of thrombin-serpin complexes were based on starting concentration of thrombin in each reaction. SDS-PAGE analysis followed by autoradiography revealed reduced mobility of 125I-thrombin in the presence of serpins, but not FPRck (Fig. 1). Lys residues in exosites 1 and 2 of thrombin are sensitive to chemical modification (26Church F.C. Pratt C.W. Noyes C.M. Kalayanamit T. Sherrill G.B. Tobin R.B. Meade J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18419-18425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, fluorescein-thrombin was prepared by activating fluorescein-prothrombin, with the expectation that the incompletely exposed exosites on prothrombin (27Anderson P.J. Nesset A.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4727-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) would be protected from modification. Prothrombin was labeled with 20-fold molar excess of FITC in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 9.0, for 1 h in the dark. Unincorporated FITC was removed by chromatography on a PD-10 column. Activation of 5 mg of fluorescein-prothrombin was carried out in the presence of 3 nm factor Xa, 4 nm factor Va, 20 μm phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles, and 2 mm CaCl2 until the activity of aliquots with tGPR-pNA reached a plateau. The reaction was made 5 mm in EDTA and applied to a Q-Sepharose column. Fluorescein-thrombin, which eluted in the flow-through fraction, was precipitated with 80% ammonium sulfate, resuspended in TS, and dialyzed against TS overnight. By protein absorbance and chromogenic activity, the concentration was determined to be 16 μm. Fluorescein-thrombin, prepared in this manner, demonstrated clotting activity, chromogenic activity, and inhibition by antithrombin comparable to native thrombin. Fluorescein-hirudin54–65, prepared as described previously (14Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), was added to a quartz cuvette at a concentration of 10 nm in 900 μl of TS. The sample was stirred with a mini-stirbar and maintained at 23 °C using a circulating water bath. Fluorescence of the sample (Io) was monitored at 1-s intervals using a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B luminescence spectrometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 492 and 535 nm, respectively, with a 515-nm filter in the emission beam and slit widths of 15 and 20 nm, respectively. The sample was then titrated with active thrombin or thrombin-serpin complexes. After addition of each aliquot, the signal was allowed to stabilize for 1 min. After the titration, fluorescence intensity (I) values were obtained from the time-drive profile. Plots of I/Io versus titrant concentration were analyzed by non-linear regression of the binding isotherm equation, as described previously (14Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of 10 nm fluorescein-hirudin54–65 was monitored as described above. When heparin was added to the cuvette to a concentration of 400 nm, there was no change in fluorescence intensity. Subsequent addition of 200 nmthrombin produced a ∼15% decrease in fluorescence intensity. Antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, or α1-antitrypsin M358R was then added to a concentration of 400 nm, and fluorescence was monitored until the signal reached a plateau. The affinity of fluorescein-HD-1 for thrombin was determined by titrating 20 nm fluorescein-HD-1 in 2 ml of TS with active thrombin. Fluorescence was monitored, and the plot ofI/Io versus thrombin concentration was analyzed as described above to determine Kd . The effect of serpin addition on the binding of fluorescein-HD-1 to thrombin was then examined in the absence or presence of 4 nm heparin. Addition of 100 nm thrombin to 20 nm fluorescein-HD-1 resulted in a ∼4% increase in fluorescence intensity. Once the signal equilibrated, antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, or α1-antitrypsin M358R was added to 500 nm, and the fluorescence monitored until the signal reached a plateau. Fluorescein-thrombin or fluorescein-thrombin-serpin complexes were titrated with HD-22 for determination of Kd . A 2-ml sample containing 100 nm fluorescein-thrombin was incubated with 200 nm α1-antitrypsin M358R, 1 μmantithrombin, or 1 μm heparin cofactor II for more than 15 min, a time sufficient to achieve complete inhibition of thrombin activity. Fluorescence was monitored while fluorescein-thrombin or fluorescein-thrombin-serpin complexes were then titrated with HD-22 andKd values were determined as described above. Binding of synthetic pentasaccharide to antithrombin was assessed by monitoring the intrinsic protein fluorescence of antithrombin in the absence and presence of pentasaccharide. Antithrombin at 100 nm, in the absence or presence of 300 nm thrombin, was equilibrated in 800 μl of TS in a cuvette for 1 h. The sample was monitored with excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 340 nm, respectively, with slitwidths of 5 nm and a 290-nm cutoff filter in the emission beam. Aliquots of pentasaccharide were added, and the fluorescence was monitored. I/Io values were determined andKd values calculated as described above. Heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography was used for qualitative assessment of the affinities of thrombin- and thrombin-serpin complexes for heparin. Samples containing 1–2 μg of 125I-thrombin or125I-thrombin-serpin complexes were loaded onto a 0.6 × 10 cm column containing 4 ml of heparin-Sepharose equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a Beckman System Gold high performance liquid chromatography system. After washing, a 50-min linear gradient to 1 or 2 m NaCl was initiated. Fractions (2 ml) were collected and counted for radioactivity. In supplemental experiments, unlabeled thrombin or thrombin-serpin complexes (50–400 μg) were subjected to chromatography, and the elution was monitored at 280 nm with an online UV detector. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and peak protein-containing fractions were lyophilized, reconstituted in water, and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Gels were stained with Fast Stain (Zoion Research, Shrewsbury, MA), and the bands were quantified by densitometry with an ImageMaster VDS (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Autoantibody D, an IgG that inhibits clotting, binds to exosite 1 on thrombin (29Wu Q. Picard V. Aiach M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody was affinity-purified from a crude IgG fraction on a thrombin-agarose column, prepared with biotin-FPRck and streptavidin-agarose (14Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25493-25499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The IgG fraction was applied to the column and the flow-through material reapplied three times. After the column was washed with TS, bound IgG was eluted with Gentle Elution Buffer (Pierce). The eluate was dialyzedversus TS and concentrated by ultrafiltration with a Centricon 30 (Amicon Corp., Beverly, MA). For binding studies, 0.5 μm125I-thrombin or preformed125I-thrombin-serpin complexes was incubated with 2.4 μm autoantibody D for 1 h. An equal volume of protein G-agarose was added to the tubes, and the samples were mixed for 15 min on an end-over-end rotator. The samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants were removed and counted for radioactivity. The agarose was washed two times with TS, mixed with an equal volume of SDS gel sample buffer, boiled, and aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Autoradiographs of the dried gels were used to identify radioactive bands, which were excised and counted in a γ-counter. The amount of material immunoprecipitated by autoantibody D/protein G-agarose was calculated as a fraction of the radioactivity of aliquots of the reactions taken prior to autoantibody D addition. Complexes of 125I-thrombin with serpins or FPRck were incubated in microcentrifuge tubes at a concentration of 50 nm in the presence of 0–10 μm fibrinogen and 10 mm CaCl2. Atroxin was added to each sample to a final concentration of 5% (v/v), and samples were incubated for 60 min at 23 °C. Resultant fibrin was compacted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and duplicate 30-μl aliquots of the supernatant were counted for radioactivity. Plots of concentration of125I-thrombin-complexes bound versus the fibrin concentration were subjected to rectangular hyperbola analysis to calculate Kd values (30Horrevoets A.J.G. Smilde A. de Vries C. Pannekoek H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12639-12644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the integrity of exosite 1 on thrombin is compromised when the enzyme is complexed by serpins, we first compared the affinity of hirudin54–65, a peptide that binds exclusively to exosite 1 on thrombin, for active thrombin with that for thrombin complexed by the various serpins. Titration of a fluorescein derivative of hirudin54–65 with thrombin produced a saturable decrease in fluorescence intensity (Fig.2). Fluorescein-hirudin54–65bound thrombin with a Kd of 41 nm, a value consistent with that reported previously (15Liu L.W. Ye J. Johnson A.E. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23632-23636Google Scholar, 21Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although saturable binding also was observed when fluorescein-hirudin54–65 was titrated with thrombin-antithrombin complexes, the affinity of the interaction was 55-fold weaker than that with thrombin (Kd value of 2270 nm). Bock et al. (21Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) also demonstrated reduced affinity of fluorescein-hirudin54–65 for the thrombin-antithrombin complex. In their study, saturable binding of fluorescein-hirudin54–65 to the thrombin-antithrombin complex could not be demonstrated, suggesting that theKd value was greater than 5 μm. In contrast to the results obtained with thrombin-antithrombin complexes, when thrombin-heparin cofactor II or thrombin- α1-antitrypsin M358R complexes were titrated with fluorescein-hirudin54–65, no binding was detected (Fig.2). These findings suggest that the structure of thrombin may differ depending on the serpin with which it is complexed. To further explore this concept, the binding of fluorescein-hirudin54–65 to thrombin was monitored in real time as the sample was titrated with each of the three serpins. As illustrated in Fig.3, addition of thrombin to fluorescein-hirudin54–65 produced a ∼12% decrease in fluorescence intensity, and this value was unchanged upon the addition of 400 nm heparin. When 100 nm antithrombin was added, the fluorescence intensity rapidly returned to a value approaching that obtained with fluorescein-hirudin54–65alone, suggesting that antithrombin reduced the amount of fluorescein-hirudin54–65 bound to thrombin. When parallel experiments were performed with heparin cofactor II and α1-antitrypsin M358R, similar results were obtained. Based on fluorescence intensity values recorded after serpin addition, heparin cofactor II or α1-antitrypsin M358R displaced 99% of fluorescein-hirudin54–65 from thrombin, whereas only 92% displacement was observed with antithrombin. Reduced displacement with antithrombin relative to the other two serpins is consistent with the observation that fluorescein-hirudin54–65 retains affinity for the thrombin-antithrombin complex, albeit much less than that for thrombin (Fig. 2). To determine whether formation of a covalent complex between thrombin and a non-serpin, active-site-directed inhibitor is sufficient to alter the integrity of exosite 1, FPRck (500 nm) was added to a cuvette containing fluorescein-hirudin54–65 and thrombin (not shown). In contrast to the results with the serpins, chloromethyl ketone addition had no effect on fluorescence intensity, indicating that it did not displace fluorescein-hirudin54–65 from exosite 1. These results suggest that reduced binding of exosite 1-directed ligands to thrombin complexed by serpins cannot be explained solely by covalent complex formation at the active site of the enzyme. Displacement experiments also were performed using an exosite 1-directed DNA aptamer, HD-1, in place of the hirudin54–65peptide (22Bock L. Griffin L.C. Latham J.A. Vermaas E.H. Toole J.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 564-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). The fluorescent derivative of HD-1 binds thrombin with aKd value of 235 nm, producing an ∼11% increase in fluorescence intensity (Fig.4, inset). Under the conditions of the displacement experiment, addition of 100 nm thrombin to 20 nm fluorescein-HD-1 resulted in a ∼3.5% increase in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4). When 500 nm antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, or α1-antitrypsin M358R was added in the presence of 4 nm heparin, the fluorescence intensity rapidly returned to a value similar to that of unbound fluorescein-HD-1. These results are in agreement with those obtained with hirudin54–65, suggesting that exosite 1 function is compromised when thrombin is complexed by serpins. The observation that antithrombin addition results in complete displacement of fluorescein-HD-1, but not of fluorescein-hirudin54–65, may reflect differing binding interactions between the two ligands and thrombin. To determine whether the interaction of exosite 1 with physiological ligands also was altered when thrombin was complexed with serpins, we compared the binding of thrombin-serpin complexes to fibrin with that of thrombin (Fig. 5). Samples containing 50 nm125I-thrombin or125I-thrombin-serpin complexes and 0–10 μmfibrinogen were clotted with Atroxin. After 60-min incubation, clots were compacted by centrifugation and unbound 125I-thrombin or 125I-thrombin-serpin complex in the supernatants was quantified by counting aliquots for radioactivity. Under these conditions, thrombin bound fibrin with a Kd value of 1.6 μm, a value comparable to that reported previously (31Hogg P.J. Bock P.E. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 424-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32Binnie C.G. Lord S.T. Blood. 1993; 81: 3186-3192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, no binding of thrombin-serpin complexes was observed. Thus, the loss of function of exosite 1 observed with synthetic ligands extends to physiological ligands such as fibrin. As a second macromolecular probe of exosite 1, binding of a thrombin-specific antibody to thrombin and thrombin serpin complexes was examined. Autoantibody D is a human-derived antibody that binds to thrombin to exosite 1, as demonstrated by the lack of binding to thrombin variants with mutations in this region (29Wu Q. Picard V. Aiach M. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3725-3730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using protein G-agarose to extract thrombin-antibody complexes, autoantibody D bound 66% of 125I-thrombin (not shown). The antibody recovered 11, 10, and 13% of the radioactivity of thrombin-antithrombin, thrombin-heparin cofactor II, or thrombin-α1-antitrypsin M358R complexes, respectively. Thus, reactivity with the exosite 1-directed antibody was greatly reduced when thrombin was complexed with serpins. Havin"

To identify additional structural determinants, we studied two metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors, the mGlu2 and mGlu7 receptors, that are both coupled to Go proteins but are known to affect different effectors in neurons. Thus, the mGlu2 receptor selectively blocks N- and L-type Ca2+ channels via a protein kinase C-independent pathway, whereas the mGlu7 receptor selectively blocks P/Q-type Ca2+ channels via a protein kinase C-dependent pathway, and both effects are pertussis toxin-sensitive. We examined the role of the C-terminal domain of these receptors in this coupling. Chimeras were constructed by exchanging the C terminus of these receptors and transfected into neurons. Different chimeric receptors bearing the C terminus of mGlu7 receptor blocked selectively P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, whereas chimeras bearing the C terminus of mGlu2 receptor selectively blocked N- and L-type Ca2+ channels.

G protein-coupled receptor metabotropic glutamate protein kinase C dihydroxyphenyl glycine green fluorescent protein dl-aminophosphonobutyrate inositol phosphate The physiological actions of most neurotransmitters are mediated by activation of both ionotropic and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs1 or metabotropic receptors). For instance, the metabotropic receptors activated by the excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate, play crucial roles in synaptic plasticity, neurotoxicity, as well as neuroprotection. These effects result from a large variety of regulations such as direct mediation of glutaminergic synaptic transmission or modulation of neurotransmitter release or membrane excitability (1Pin J.P. Bockaert J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Transduction of extracellular signals to intracellular responses via GPCR includes stimulation of the receptor, activation of a trimeric G protein, and subsequent mobilization of specific effectors. The regions of the receptor involved in G protein activation have been studied extensively (2Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The second intracellular loop of mGlu receptors is responsible for the selective recognition of the G protein α subunit (3Pin J.P. Joly C. Heinemann S.F. Bockaert J.

Eight genes encoding mGlu receptors have been identified and classified into three groups, according to their sequence and intracellular signaling. The group I mGlu receptors (mGlu1 and -5) are coupled to Gq-like proteins and activate phospholipase C, whereas the group II (mGlu2 and -3) and group III (mGlu4 and -6–8) receptors are coupled to Gi/Go proteins and inhibit cAMP formation (5Prezeau L.

Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). The signaling cascades of mGlu receptors seem, however, to be far more complex than these consensual pathways. These receptors can indeed activate cGMP phosphodiesterase (7Nawy S. Jahr C.E. Nature. 1990; 346: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), phospholipase D (8Boss V. Conn P.J. J.

Nature. 1990; 347: 182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (10Ferraguti F. Baldani-Guerra B. Corsi M. Nakanishi S. Corti C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2073-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Through these pathways, the mGlu receptors can control ionic channel activities (11Kammermeier P.J. Ikeda S.R. Neuron. 1999; 22: 819-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 12Fagni L. Chavis P. Ango F. Bockaert J.

Nature. 1990; 347: 765-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Thus it is remarkable that mGlu receptors activating the same group of G proteins inhibit distinct Ca2+ channel subtypes (14Sahara Y. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3041-3050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chavis P. Fagni L. Bockaert J. Lansman J.B. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Ikeda S.R.

Science. 1993; 259: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) have suggested that G protein β subunits may be essential for the specific coupling of various metabotropic neurotransmitter receptors to Ca2+ channels, but others (21Jeong S.W. Ikeda S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Jeong S.W. Ikeda S.R. J.

A. 1999; 96: 10899-10904Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) have shown that the same G protein βγ subunit combination can inhibit different Ca2+ channel subtypes and vice versa. The mGlu receptors have even been shown to activate directly effectors and generate cellular responses independently of G protein activation (25Heuss C. Gerber U. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 469-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This large variety of mGlu receptor actions together with the limited number of functional G protein subunit combinations (26Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) suggest that the signaling cascade specificity of a given GPCR cannot arise solely from the nature of the activated G protein. The aim of the present study was to examine whether receptor structural determinants are involved in the specificity of GPCR signaling. To address this issue we studied two GPCRs, the mGlu2 and mGlu7 receptor subtypes. These receptors are both coupled to Gi/Go proteins but trigger different second messenger cascades, in cultured cerebellar granule cells. Thus, both receptors activate a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, but the mGlu2 receptor selectively blocks N- and L-type Ca2+ channels (15Chavis P. Fagni L. Bockaert J. Lansman J.B. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), whereas the mGlu7 receptor blocks the P/Q-type Ca2+channels (27Perroy J. Prézeau L. De Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the effect of the mGlu7 (27Perroy J. Prézeau L. De Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not mGlu2 (15Chavis P. Fagni L. Bockaert J. Lansman J.B. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) receptor is PKC-dependent. To examine the possible role of the C-terminal intracellular domain of these receptors in specifying their transduction cascade, the coupling to N- and L- or P/Q-type Ca2+ channels of chimeric receptors bearing either the C-terminal domain of mGlu2 or that of mGlu7 was examined in cultured cerebellar granule cells. We found that the C terminus of the mGlu7 receptor was necessary and sufficient to select a PKC-dependent inhibitory pathway specific to the P/Q-type Ca2+ channel, whereas the C terminus of the mGlu2 receptor was necessary and sufficient for a PKC-independent inhibition of N- and L-type Ca2+ channels. These findings reveal a new role of the C terminus of mGlu2 and mGlu7 receptors in specifying their respective transduction cascades downstream from the G protein activation. Primary cultures of cerebellar cells were prepared as described previously (28Van Vliet B.J. Sebben M. Dumuis A. Gabrion J. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-week-old newborn mice were decapitated and the cerebellum dissected. The tissue was then gently triturated using fire-polished Pasteur pipettes, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 500 rpm. The pellet was resuspended and plated in tissue culture dishes previously coated with poly-l-ornithine. Cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's minimum essential medium and F-12 nutrient (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with glucose (30 mm), glutamine (2 mm), sodium bicarbonate (3 mm), HEPES buffer (5 mm), decomplemented fetal calf serum (10%), and 25 mm KCl to improve neuronal survival. One-week-old cultures contained 1 × 106 cells. The chimeric receptors were constructed as follows. The mGlu2/7 and mGlu7/2 chimeras were obtained by exchanging the C-terminal region proximal to the seventh transmembrane domain of the mGlu7a receptor (beginning with HPELNVQKRK) with its homologous mGlu2 receptor domain (beginning with QPQKNVVSHR) (see Fig. 2), using the polymerase chain reaction overlap method (29Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6829) Google Scholar). The construction of the mGlu1/2 chimera containing the N-terminal extracellular domain of the mGlu1 receptor and the heptahelical and C-terminal regions of the mGlu2 receptor has been described previously (30Caroll F. Stolle A. Beart P.M. Voerste A. Brabet I. Mauler F. Joly C. Antonicek H. Bockaert J. Muller T. Pin J.P. Prézeau L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The mGlu1/2/7 chimera was constructed by replacing the fragment encoding the 3′-half of the mGlu1/2 chimera by that of the mGlu2/7 chimera, using the BsrGI and XbaI restriction sites of the mGlu2 receptor heptahelical domain coding sequence and the pRK5 poly-linker, respectively. The wild type and chimeric receptors were tested for their coupling to G protein using the method that we described previously (31Parmentier M.L. Joly C. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Grau Y. Pin J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation was measured in HEK-293 cells co-transfected with the tested receptor and a recombinant G protein. The mGlu1 receptor was co-transfected with a GHQ protein, whereas the mGlu2, mGlu7a, mGlu2/7, mGlu7/2, mGlu1/2, and mGlu1/2/7 receptors were co-transfected with a chimeric Gqi9 protein. In the Gqi9 chimeric protein, the C-terminal 9 residues of the G protein αq subunit were replaced by those of the G protein αi2 subunit, enabling the coupling of the receptors to phospholipase C (4Gomeza J.

Restituito S. Bockaert J. Grau Y. Pin J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Immediately before plating, cerebellar cultures were co-transfected with the mGlu2 or mGlu7a receptors or one of the chimeras, and the transfection marker green fluorescent protein (GFP)-containing plasmid, pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH), using the transfection lipid, Transfast (32Ango F. Albani-Torregrossa S. Joly C. Robbe D. Michel J.M. Pin J.P. Bockaert J. Fagni L. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The wild type mGlu7a and chimeric mGlu7/2 receptors were tagged at their N terminus with a Myc epitope, as described previously (27Perroy J. Prézeau L. De Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of these Myc-tagged proteins at the cell surface was examined in living (non-permeabilized) cultured neurons. Cells were exposed for 30 min at 37 °C to a polyclonal rabbit anti-Myc (1/300; ABR, Inc.) primary antibody and then rinsed, fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1m glucose-containing phosphate-buffered saline solution, and exposed for 2 h at room temperature to a goat Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1/1000; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cells were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on a glass coverslip for observation on an Axiophot 2 Zeiss microscope. The intensity of Myc immunolabeling was measured on the cell body using the NIH Image program (Wayne Rasband). The ratio of total fluorescence of the cell body area over background (noise) fluorescence was determined in non-saturating conditions of the camera. The fluorescence values were then averaged and compared between neurons transfected with N-Myc-mGlu7a and -mGlu7/2 receptors. We used the whole-cell patch clamp configuration to record Ba2+ current (IBa) from GFP-expressing (mGlu receptor co-transfected) cerebellar granule cells, after 9 ± 1 days in vitro, as described previously (32Ango F.

Drug solutions were prepared in this medium, and pH was readjusted to 7.4. TheN-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor channel blocker, MK-801 (1 μm), was added to all solutions to avoid activation of this receptor by the d-isoform ofdl-AP4. 2J. Perroy, G. J. Gutierrez, V.

Pipettes had resistances of 3–5 megohms when filled with the following internal solution (in mm): cesium acetate (100), MgCl2 (2Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin.

Barium currents were evoked by 500-ms voltage clamp pulses, from a holding potential of −80 mV, to a test potential of 0 mV, applied at a rate of 0.1 Hz. Current signals were recorded using an Axopatch 200 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 1 kHz with an 8-pole Bessel filter, and sampled at 3 kHz on a Pentium II PC computer. Analyses were performed using the pClamp6 program of Axon Instruments. Barium currents were measured at their peak amplitude and values expressed as mean ± S.E. of the indicated number (n) of experiments. The Student's t test (p ≤ 0.05) was used for comparison. dl-Aminophosphonobutyrate (dl-AP4), dihydroxyphenyl glycine (DHPG), and MK-801 were purchased from Tocris Cockson (UK). Nimodipine and GF109203X were purchased from Research Biochemicals. ω-Agatoxin-IVA and ω-conotoxin-GVIA were from Alomone Labs (Israel). LY354740 was a generous gift from D. Schoepp (Lilly). An antibody raised against the Go protein was a generous gift from V. Homburger. This antibody has been shown previously to recognize specifically the G protein αo subunit but not the αi subunit (33Lledo P.M. Homburger V. Bockaert J. Vincent J.D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 455-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The effect of mGlu2 and mGlu7 receptors on Ba2+ currents (IBa) was studied in cultured cerebellar granule cells transfected with GFP alone (control) or in combination with either one of these receptors. In control neurons, the selective P/Q-type (ω-agatoxin-IVA; 250 nm), N-type (ω-conotoxin-GVIA; 1 μm) and L-type (nimodipine; 1 μm) Ca2+ channel blockers inhibited 41, 10, and 22% IBa, respectively. The remaining 27% IBa resulted from activation of the R-type Ca2+ channels. Similar data were obtained in non-transfected neurons (15Chavis P. Fagni L. Bockaert J. Lansman J.B. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or neurons co-transfected with GFP and either the mGlu7 (Fig.1 A) or mGlu2 (Fig.1 C) receptors. These results indicated that the transfection procedure did not alter functional expression of the native Ca2+ channels. As previously shown, the group III mGlu receptor agonist,dl-AP4 (500 μm), had no significant effect on IBa, in non-transfected or control (transfected with GFP alone) cerebellar granule cells (27Perroy J. Prézeau L. De Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the absence of mGlu7 receptor in the soma of these cells. After transfection, the mGlu7 receptor was expressed in the cell body, which allowed us to study the effect of this receptor on IBa (27Perroy J. Prézeau L. De Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under this condition, dl-AP4 selectively blocked IBa, and the inhibitory effect of this drug on IBa2+ was additive with those of ω-conotoxin-GVIA and nimodipine but not with that of ω-agatoxin-IVA (Fig. 1 B). These results indicated that the transfected mGlu7 receptor blocked specifically P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. In non-transfected (15Chavis P. Fagni L. Bockaert J. Lansman J.B. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 34Chavis P. Shinozaki H. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7067-7076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as in mGlu2 receptor-transfected neurons (Fig. 1 D), the mGlu2 receptor agonist, LY354740 (1 μm), selectively inhibited N- and L-type Ca2+channels. Because cultured cerebellar granule cells express native mGlu2 receptor, LY354740 could activate both the endogenous and the transfected mGlu2 receptors. To rule out any activation of the endogenous receptor, we constructed the so-called mGlu1/2 chimeric receptor that harbored the N-terminal domain of the mGlu1 receptor and the seven transmembranes with C-terminal domains of the mGlu2 receptor (Fig. 2). This chimera was transfected in cultured cerebellar granule cells and activated with the group I mGlu receptor agonist, DHPG (400 μm). Because of the presence of native mGluR1 receptors in granule neurons, DHPG was applied in the presence of Bay36-7620 (10 μm), a non-competitive and highly selective mGlu1 receptor antagonist that acts within the transmembrane domains of this receptor (30Caroll F. Stolle A. Beart P.M. Voerste A. Brabet I. Mauler F. Joly C. Antonicek H. Bockaert J. Muller T. Pin J.P. Prézeau L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, this antagonist blocked the native (32Ango F. Albani-Torregrossa S. Joly C. Robbe D. Michel J.M. Pin J.P. Bockaert J. Fagni L. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or recombinant mGlu1 receptor (Fig.1 E) but not the mGlu2 (30Caroll F. Stolle A. Beart P.M. Voerste A. Brabet I. Mauler F. Joly C. Antonicek H. Bockaert J. Muller T. Pin J.P. Prézeau L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) or mGlu1/2 receptor (Fig.1 F). In neurons transfected with the mGlu1/2 receptor, DHPG induced similar IBa inhibition (Fig. 1 G) as the mGlu2 receptor agonist (Fig. 1 D), indicating that the transfected mGlu1/2 receptor displayed similar selective coupling to N- and L-type Ca2+ channels, as the native mGlu2 receptor, in the same cells. In cerebellar granule cells co-transfected with the mGlu7 and mGlu1/2 receptors, the respective receptor agonists induced selective and additive inhibitions of P/Q- and N-/L-type Ca2+ channels (Fig. 3). Thus co-transfection and overexpression of the mGlu1/2 and mGlu7 receptors did not change the selective coupling of these receptors to distinct Ca2+channels in the studied neurons. We have shown previously that in neurons transfected with the mGlu7 receptor, intracellular injection of a specific antibody raised against the G protein αo subunit blocked the inhibitory effect ofdl-AP4 on IBa, without significantly altering the current density in the absence of agonist (27Perroy J. Prézeau L. De Waard M. Shigemoto R. Bockaert J. Fagni L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7896-7904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the same antibody injected in mGlu2-transfected neurons antagonized the inhibitory effect of LY354740 on IBa (LY354740 induced 12 ± 2% inhibition;n = 7). The boiled antibody was without effect. These results showed that both mGlu2 and mGlu7 receptors acted via a Go protein. We investigated the role of the C terminus of mGlu2 and mGlu7 receptors in the selective coupling of these receptors to Ca2+ channels. To this end, we exchanged the C terminus of the mGlu2 and mGlu7 receptors to obtain the reciprocal mGlu2/7 and mGlu7/2 chimeras (Fig. 2,A and B). The amino acid sequences of the exchanged C-terminal regions are represented in Fig. 2 C. In mGlu7/2-transfected neurons, dl-AP4 inhibited 32% of IBa. The remaining IBa was not significantly affected by ω-conotoxin-GVIA or nimodipine. However, the current was further depressed by ω-agatoxin-IVA (Fig. 4 A) and in similar proportions as in control cells (compare with Fig.1 A). These results show that exchanging the C terminus of mGlu7 receptor with the one of mGlu2 receptor switched the selective coupling of the mGlu7 receptor to that of the mGlu2 receptor. No statistical difference was observed between cell surface immunolabeling of the mGlu7 and mGlu7/2 receptors (immunofluorescence values: 7.0 ± 0.6, n = 10; 7.4 ± 0.8, n = 10, respectively; p ≤ 0.05), indicating that the difference observed in the selective coupling of these receptors to Ca2+ channels could not result from differential cell surface expression of the receptors. In mGlu2/7-transfected cells, LY354740 blocked 55% of IBa. Following this inhibition, neither ω-conotoxin-GVIA, nimodipine, nor ω-agatoxin-IVA further inhibited IBa (Fig. 4 B). These results were consistent with a blockade of P/Q-type as well as N- and L-type Ca2+ channels by the mGlu2 receptor agonist, probably through activation of the transfected mGlu2/7 and native mGlu2 receptors, respectively. To avoid any activation of the endogenous mGlu2 receptor, we transfected the mGlu1/2/7 receptor construct (N terminus of mGlu1 with the seven transmembrane domains of mGlu2 and the C terminus of mGlu7; Fig. 2) and stimulated this chimera with DHPG, in the presence of Bay36-7620. Under these conditions, DHPG inhibited 34% of IBa. Application of ω-conotoxin-IVA and nimodipine, in the presence of these drugs, inhibited 9 and 23% of total IBa, whereas ω-agatoxin-IVA had no significant additional effect (Fig.4 C). These results indicated that DHPG blocked selectively P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. In a separate series of experiments, an initial application of a given channel blocker was immediately followed by application of the transfected receptor agonist. Thus, in mGlu7/2 receptor-transfected cells, after blockade of N- and L-type Ca2+ channels with ω-conotoxin-GVIA and nimodipine, respectively, the resistant IBa was not affected by subsequent application of dl-AP4 (Fig. 4 D). In mGlu2/7-transfected cells, after blockade of N-, L-, and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels with ω-conotoxin-GVIA, nimodipine, and ω-agatoxin-IVA, the drug/toxin-insensitive IBa was not further depressed by application of LY354740 (Fig. 4 E). Finally, in mGlu1/2/7 receptor-transfected cells, after blockade of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels with ω-agatoxin-IVA, DHPG did not further inhibit the remaining IBa (Fig. 4 F). Altogether these results indicated that exchanging the C terminus of mGlu2 with the one of mGlu7 receptor switched the selective coupling of mGlu2 to the one of mGlu7 receptor. We verified that the switch in the coupling to Ca2+channels by exchanging mGlu receptor C termini resulted from a switch in the receptor signaling pathway. The PKC inhibitor, GF-109203X (10 μm), strongly reduced the amount of mGlu7 or mGlu1/2/7 receptor-induced IBa inhibition without affecting mGlu2, or mGlu1/2, or mGlu7/2 receptor-induced inhibition (Fig.5). These results indicated that the C terminus of mGlu2 and mGlu7 receptors specified the receptor signaling pathway, and thus the selectivity of the receptor coupling to Ca2+ channels, in neurons. As reviewed in Table I, our results show for the first time that the C terminus of mGlu2 and -7 receptors is a molecular determinant involved in the selectivity of coupling to specific effectors. To characterize this molecular feature, we used chimeric receptors transfected in neuronal cultures. This type of preparation provided a more physiological environment than classical heterologous expression systems, notably for studying receptor transduction signaling, because the natural transduction pathway and effectors were expected to be present in our model. Moreover, we verified that the transfection and overexpression of the studied wild type receptors did not modify their signaling pathway and coupling to Ca2+ channels as compared with the endogenous receptors. We also verified that the differences observed between functional responses of the wild type and corresponding chimeric receptors did not result from differential cell surface expression of these receptors.Table IResults summaryReceptors harboring the mGlu7 C terminus select a PKC pathway and specifically inhibit P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, whereas receptors harboring the mGlu2 C terminus do not activate the PKC pathway and selectively inhibit N- and L-type Ca2+ channels. The C terminus of these receptors is necessary and sufficient to select a specific signaling pathway. Open table in a new tab Receptors harboring the mGlu7 C terminus select a PKC pathway and specifically inhibit P/Q-type Ca2+ channels, whereas receptors harboring the mGlu2 C terminus do not activate the PKC pathway and selectively inhibit N- and L-type Ca2+ channels. The C terminus of these receptors is necessary and sufficient to select a specific signaling pathway. The existence of a large number of GPCR-mediated signaling pathways, with respect to the limited number of functional G protein subunits, raises the question of how a particular receptor is selectively coupled to a given effector. We provide insight into this question by showing that the C terminus of two Go protein-coupled mGlu receptors is a key molecular determinant for selecting a specific signaling pathway. This part of the mGlu receptors has not been reported to be involved in the coupling specificity to G protein α subunit (3Pin J.P. Joly C. Heinemann S.F. Bockaert J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 4Gomeza J. Joly C. Kuhn R. Knopfel T. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2199-2205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This was consistent with the idea that activation of a specific class of G protein by a given GPCR does not seem to be sufficient to determine the specificity of the receptor transduction pathway. For instance in sympathetic neurons, various neurotransmitter receptors have been shown to inhibit N-type Ca2+ channels whatever the nature of the α and βγ subunits of the activated recombinant G protein (21Jeong S.W. Ikeda S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Consistent with our findings, a growing body of evidence suggests that in addition to the G protein activation, the C terminus of mGlu receptors plays an essential role in the selection of a specific signaling pathway. Because the C terminus of the receptor is the target of a number of kinases and intracellular proteins (35De Blasi A. Conn J.P. Pin J.P. Nicoletti F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 114-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), these factors may support the selectivity of the receptor coupling. The two following examples are in favor of this hypothesis. A first example is the differential coupling of the mGlu5 receptor to either combined IP3 and cAMP or single IP3 pathways, depending on the PKC-mediated phosphorylation of two C-terminal serine residues at positions 881 and 890 (35De Blasi A. Conn J.P. Pin J.P. Nicoletti F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 114-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 36Gereau R.W.T. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1998; 20: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 37Francesconi A. Duvoisin R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5615-5624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A second example is the PKC-mediated phosphorylation of a C-terminal threonine residue, at position 840 of the mGlu5 receptor. This phosphorylation is responsible for generation of Ca2+ oscillations in response to agonist. By contrast, the mGlu1a receptor displays an aspartate residue in this corresponding position and triggers a single peak Ca2+ response (38Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, because of differential phosphorylation of their C terminus, mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors can display different signaling cascades, although both receptors activate Gq proteins. The same might apply to mGlu2 and mGlu7 receptors, but no such functional specific differential phosphorylation sites have been reported so far for these receptors. Therefore, such a hypothesis would need further specific examination. Proteins that interact differentially with the C terminus of mGlu2 and mGlu7 receptors are also good candidates for selective activation of different transduction pathways. To our knowledge, no protein has been shown to interact directly with the C terminus of the mGlu2 receptor. By contrast, the mGlu7 receptor C terminus displays binding sites for a number of intracellular proteins (39Dev K.K. Nakanishi S. Henley J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 355-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Indeed, both calmodulin and Gβγ subunits can bind, in a mutually exclusive manner, to a subdomain in the C terminus of the mGlu7 receptor. Thus, dissociation of the βγ subunits from the activated G protein interacts with the mGlu7 receptor C terminus. However, the binding of calmodulin to the receptor will promote dissociation of the G protein βγ subunits from the receptor, thus making these subunits available for inhibiting P/Q-type Ca2+ channels (40O'Connor V. El Far O. Bofill-Cardona E. Nanoff C. Freissmuth M. Karschin A. Airas J.M. Betz H. Boehm S. Science. 1999; 286: 1180-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that inhibition of Ca2+ channels by the mGu7 receptor may not solely depend on activation of a G protein but also on protein-protein interaction in the C terminus of the receptor. A second candidate is the PDZ domain-containing protein, protein interacting with C kinase 1 (PICK1). This protein interacts with the very last 3 C-terminal amino acids of the mGlu7a receptor (41Boudin H. Doan A. Xia J. Shigemoto R. Huganir R.L. Worley P. Craig A.M. Neuron. 2000; 28: 485-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 42Dev K.K. Nakajima Y. Kitano J. Braithwaite S.P. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. J.

The PDZ domain of PICK1 also interacts with PKCα (44Staudinger J. Lu J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) thus creating a functional complex comprising the mGlu7 receptor, a PICK1 dimer and PKCα (42Dev K.K. Nakajima Y. Kitano J. Braithwaite S.P. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7252-7257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These associations may be functionally important in the PKC-dependent coupling of the mGlu7 receptor to P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. Our results may be of particular interest in understanding the physiological significance of alternative splicing of GPCRs. Strikingly, the variable part in GPCR splicing, including the class of mGlu receptors (12Fagni L. Chavis P. Ango F. Bockaert J. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), is their C-terminal domain. For example, the natural mGlu7a receptor splice variant, mGluR7b, is generated by an out-of-frame insertion in the C terminus that results in the replacement of the last 16 amino acids of the mGlu7a receptor by 23 different amino acids (45Flor P.J.

Rimland J.M. Brabet I. Corsi M. Pin J.P. Ferraguti F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 3629-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). According to our finding that the C terminus of mGlu receptors plays a key role in the receptor coupling to specific effectors, different mGlu receptor splice variants could lead to different signaling pathways, depending on the splice site choice.

https://openalex.org/W2149741189,"NMR techniques and 8-anilino-1-napthalenesulphonate (ANS) binding studies have been used to characterize the apo state of a variant of cytochromec 552 from Hydrogenobacter thermophilus. In this variant the two cysteines that form covalent thioether linkages to the heme group have been replaced by alanine residues (C11A/C14A). CD studies show that the apo state contains ∼14% helical secondary structure, and measurements of hydrodynamic radii using pulse field gradient NMR methods show that it is compact (Rh, 16.6 Å). The apo state binds 1 mol of ANS/mol of protein, and a linear reduction in fluorescence enhancement is observed on adding aliquots of hemin to a solution of apo C11A/C14A cytochrome c 552 with ANS bound. These results suggest that the bound ANS is located in the heme binding pocket, which would therefore be at least partially formed in the apo state. Consistent with these characteristics, the formation of the holo state of the variant cytochrome c 552 from the apo state on the addition of heme has been demonstrated using NMR techniques. The properties of the apo state of C11A/C14A cytochromec 552 reported here contrast strongly with those of mitochondrial cytochrome c whose apo state resembles a random coil under similar conditions.

There has been much interest in characterizing the structural and dynamical properties of the apo forms of heme-binding proteins to gain insight into the stability, folding, and assembly of these ubiquitous proteins (e.g. see Refs. 1Barrick D. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 2Feng Y.Q. Sligar S.G. Wand A.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 3Goto Y. Fink A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Such studies are of particular significance for the c-type class of cytochromes where the heme group must become covalently bound to the protein to generate the functional native structure (4Pettigrew G.W. Moore G.R. Cytochromes c: Evolutionary, Structural and Physiochemical Aspects. Springer, Berlin1990Google Scholar). For mitochondrial cytochrome c, the most studied of this class of proteins, both the local and global properties of the apo state in aqueous solution have been shown to resemble those expected for an unfolded random coil (5Fisher W.R. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Damaschun G. Damaschun H. Gast K. Gernat C. Zirwer D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1078: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), although more compact conformations with some helical secondary structure are observed at high salt concentrations (7Hamada D. Hoshino M. Kataoka M. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10351-10358Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or in the presence of lipid membranes (8de Jongh H.H. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1636-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Rankin S.E. Watts A. Roder H. Pinheiro T.J.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, noncovalent binding of heme gives rise to a partially folded state, the heme group presumably acting as a site for nucleation of protein folding (10Dumont M.E. Corin A.F. Campbell G.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7368-7378Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Despite these findings heme has not been found spontaneously in vitro to attach covalently to the apo form of mitochondrial cytochrome c. It is, therefore, not possible to reconstitute the native holo structure simply by adding heme to the apo state of the protein. Biophysical studies of the folding of mitochondrial cytochromec have all been performed with intact thioether bonds between the two cysteines of the CXXCH motif and the heme group (11Englander S.W. Sosnick T.R. Mayne L.C. Shtilerman M. Qi P.X. Bai Y.W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 737-744Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12Shastry M.C.R. Sauder J.M. Roder H. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 717-725Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13Yeh S.R. Han S.W. Rousseau D.L. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 727-736Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, to what extent the data from these studies relate to the situation in vivo where the covalent attachment of the heme to the protein has to take place at some stage during the folding process. In bacteria the covalent attachment of heme occurs physiologically in the periplasm where the cytochrome c biogenesis apparatus, which varies in complexity depending on cell type, is located (14Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 15Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 103-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). An exception to this periplasmic location for the covalent heme attachment has been found for Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cytochromec 552, which has the same fold (sometimes called class I) as mitochondrial cytochrome c. For H. thermophilus cytochrome c 552 the holoprotein is formed in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli(16Sambongi Y. Crooke H. Cole J.A. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 18Sinha N. Ferguson S.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 161: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The attachment of heme therefore occurs independently of the biogenesis apparatus in the periplasm. It has been proposed that holoH. thermophilus cytochrome c 552 is generated spontaneously, implying that the apo state of this protein has sufficient structure to form a binding site for heme, the occupancy of which could be followed by covalent bond formation (17Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These proposed characteristics of H. thermophilus cytochromec 552 are, therefore, significantly different from those reported for mitochondrial cytochrome c. Further insight into the spontaneous formation of holo H. thermophilus cytochrome c 552 has come from the finding that replacement of the two cysteine residues of the CXXCH motif by alanines (C11A/C14A) results in a protein that binds heme noncovalently, i.e. in the formation of a cytochrome b variant of the cytochromec 552 (19Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This protein is the only example of a conversion of a c-type (defined as heme attached by two thioether bonds) to a b-type (defined as heme bound noncovalently) cytochrome through mutation and raises questions about the acquisition of the cytochrome c fold since the cytochrome b variant appears to have essentially the same native structure as the original cytochromec 552, at least as judged by CD spectroscopy (19Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Removal of the noncovalently bound heme from the cytochromeb variant generates an apoprotein that has an altered structure compared with the holo state, although CD spectroscopy suggests it is ∼14% helical (compared with 43% helical structure in the holo state). The conformational properties of this apoprotein are of considerable interest, not least because studies by both visible absorption and CD spectroscopy show that addition of heme results in the spontaneous regeneration of the cytochrome b form of the protein (19Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the apoprotein has sufficient structure to provide at least a nascent heme binding site and that following insertion of the heme into that site the cytochromec fold is adopted. In this paper we describe the results of a study of the b-type variant (C11A/C14A) of cytochromec 552 by NMR spectroscopy and ANS1 fluorescence measurements to probe directly the characteristics of its apo state. The experiments show that the apo form of C11A/C14A cytochromec 552 is compact and partially folded and suggest that it contains a nascent heme binding site. Wild type and C11A/C14A cytochromec 552 expressed as holoproteins from E. coli. were prepared as reported previously (19Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Apo C11A/C14A cytochrome c 552 was prepared by incubating on ice for 4 h a solution of purified holo C11A/C14A cytochromec 552 in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.3 containing 1 m imidazole. The sample was then centrifuged to remove the heme moiety, and the supernatant was dialyzed extensively against 20 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.3). The purified apoprotein was then lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. Reconstitution of holo C11A/C14A cytochromec 552 for the NMR studies was achieved by adding a 150-μl aliquot of a 5 mm solution of hemin in deuterated Me2SO to a 500-μl sample of 1.4 mm apoprotein (in D2O, 20 mmphosphate buffer). The sample was then incubated overnight. All NMR samples contained 1.4 mm protein in D2O at pH 7.4. 20 μl of 1% dioxan was added to the samples used for the diffusion experiments. For the NMR experiments on the holoprotein in its reduced Fe(II) state, reduction was achieved by using sodium dithionite, and the NMR tube was flame-sealed under vacuum. All NMR spectra were recorded on a home-built spectrometer at the Oxford Centre for Molecular Sciences with a 1H operating frequency of 500.15 MHz. The spectrometer is equipped with an Oxford Instruments magnet, Omega software and digital control equipment (Bruker Instruments), triple resonance pulse field gradient probe heads, and linear amplifiers. All experiments were performed at 25 °C, and the spectra were processed using Felix 2.3 software (Biosym Technologies). Pulse field gradient NMR diffusion measurements were performed with the PG-SLED (pulse gradient-stimulated echo longitudinal encode-decode) sequence (20Jones J.A. Wilkins D.K. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 199-203Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Spectra were acquired with the diffusion gradients varying between 5 and 100% of its maximum value. Each measurement was repeated six times to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The rates of decay of the intensities of the protein and dioxan resonances (dreference/dprotein) with increasing gradient strength were obtained by fitting to Gaussian functions as described previously (21Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). From the dreference/dproteindecay rate ratios effective hydrodynamic radii values for the protein were calculated assuming a hydrodynamic radius of 2.12 Å for dioxan (21Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were made using a PerkinElmer LS 50B fluorometer (excitation/emission at 389/450–550 nm; slit widths, 5/10 nm). CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter using a cell with a 1-mm optical path-length. The number of ANS binding sites per protein molecule was determined fluorimetrically as described by Stryer (22Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar) using ANS concentrations of 50 and 100 μm and protein concentrations of between 0.1 and 0.5 μm. For the experiments in which ANS bound to the apoprotein was displaced by heme, 1-μl aliquots of a 1 mm solution of hemin in Me2SO were added to 1-ml solutions of 90 μmANS and 9 μm apoprotein. The 1H NMR spectrum of the holo form of C11A/C14A cytochrome c 552 contains many well resolved resonances reflecting the folded nature of this state. In contrast the1H NMR spectrum of the apo state of C11A/C14A cytochromec 552 has a much more limited chemical shift dispersion, and some of the resonances are significantly broadened relative to those of the holoprotein. These characteristics suggest that this apo state is at most partially folded and comprises an ensemble of interconverting conformers (Fig.1 a). For the holo state there are four resolved resonances upfield of −1.0 ppm that are of particular interest. Closely similar resonances to these occur in the spectra of the holo state of wild type cytochromec 552 (23Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y., Yu, Y.H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and of the recombinant wild type protein. 2P. D. Barker, E. J. Tomlinson, N. Sinha, Y. Sambongi, and S. J. Ferguson, unpublished. Reference to the assignments of the NMR resonances of the wild type protein shows that these signals are from the side chain β, γ, and ε protons of Met-59, one of the axial ligands to the heme iron (23Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y., Yu, Y.H. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The observation of these resonances in the NMR spectrum of the holo state of the C11A/C14A cytochrome c 552 variant therefore provides strong evidence for the close structural similarity of the holo states of wild type and C11A/C14A cytochromec 552 including the characteristics of the heme binding site. NMR spectra were recorded to probe the change to the protein on adding hemin to the apo state of C11A/C14A cytochromec 552. Upon reconstitution the spectrum characteristic of the holo state was obtained, thus providing evidence for native-like heme binding and formation of the holoprotein during the experiment. Fig. 1 b shows the upfield region of the NMR spectra where the changes caused by the addition of heme are particularly marked. No resonances are visible in the spectrum of the apo form, but after the addition of hemin well resolved resonances of the side chain protons of Met-59 are clearly visible. Some line broadening of these resonances is, however, evident, and one additional weak resonance (at −1.06 ppm) is also seen in this region after reconstitution that is not observed in the holo state spectrum. The assignment of this signal is not clear, but it and the line broadening effects may be the result of the presence of species with slight variations in the heme binding. Pulse field gradient NMR methods provide a method for determining the effective hydrodynamic radii of native and non-native states of proteins (20Jones J.A. Wilkins D.K. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 199-203Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 21Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J.

The rates of decay of the intensities of protein resonances relative to those of a small reference molecule (here dioxan) are measured as a function of increasing gradient strength. From the ratio of these decay rates (dreference/dprotein) the effective hydrodynamic radius of the protein can be calculated (21Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Measurements of this type have been made for the holo form of wild type cytochromec 552 (in both its reduced Fe(II) and oxidized Fe(III) states) and for the C11A/C14A variant in its holo (reduced and oxidized) and apo forms and when denatured in 8 m urea (Table I).Table IEffective hydrodynamic radii values for wild type and C11A/C14A cytochrome c 552 measured using pulse field gradient NMR methodsdreference/dprotein1-aThe errors are estimated from repeat measurements as reported by Wilkins et al.

Open table in a new tab dreference/dprotein is the ratio of the decay rates of the intensities of the dioxan and protein signals as a function of gradient strength. The hydrodynamic radii of the holo states of wild type and C11A/C14A cytochrome c 552 are very similar (14.3 ± 0.25 and 13.9 ± 0.25 Å, respectively, for the reduced state). For both proteins an increase in the hydrodynamic radius of ∼10% is observed for the oxidized compared with the reduced state of the holoprotein. This increase is comparable to the reported 8% increase in hydrodynamic radius on oxidation for mitochondrial cytochromec measured by x-ray scattering (25Trewhella J. Carlson V.A.P. Curtis E.H. Heidorn D.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1121-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For cytochromec the differences in the effective radii of the oxidized and reduced states are thought to result from a combination of electrostatic and conformational changes. Small structural differences have been identified between the two redox forms of cytochromec (25Trewhella J. Carlson V.A.P. Curtis E.H. Heidorn D.B. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1121-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 26Eden D. Matthew J.B. Rosa J.J. Richards F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition it has been suggested that phosphate binding to lysine-rich sites at low ionic strengths in the oxidized state may contribute to the increase in the effective hydrodynamic radius (27Feng Y. Englander S.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3505-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similar effects are likely to be responsible for the differences in size of the oxidized and reduced states of cytochromec 552 reported here. Similarly the small differences observed between the hydrodynamic radii of the wild type and C11A/C14A variant of cytochrome c 552 may arise from a combination of small structural variations and of differences in the hydration spheres of the wild type and mutant proteins. Measurements for the apo form of C11A/C14A cytochromec 552 show that this form of the protein has an effective hydrodynamic radius of 16.6 ± 0.28 Å, an increase of less than 10% over the hydrodynamic radius of the oxidized form of the holo state. A significant expansion in the hydrodynamic radius of C11A/C14A cytochrome c 552 to 25.5 ± 1.19 Å is, however, observed for the protein denatured in 8m urea (a 67% increase in hydrodynamic radius compared with that of the oxidized holoprotein). The hydrodynamic radius of the latter is similar to that predicted for a fully denatured polypeptide chain of 80 amino acids (26.9 Å) by using the empirical relationship between the effective hydrodynamic radius and polypeptide chain length established from the analysis of data for a series of peptides and proteins under strongly denaturing conditions (21Wilkins D.K. Grimshaw S.B. Receveur V. Dobson C.M. Jones J.A. Smith L.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16424-16431Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). The significantly smaller hydrodynamic radius for apo C11A/C14A cytochromec 552 compared with the urea-denatured state reported here shows that the global properties of the apo form are very different from those of an unstructured or random coil protein. The apo state will, like most non-native states, be an ensemble of interconverting conformers. The value of 16.6 ± 0.28 Å measured for the effective hydrodynamic radius of the apo state requires, however, that the majority of conformers within this ensemble of structures are highly compact. The binding of the hydrophobic dye ANS to the holo, apo, and urea-denatured states of C11A/C14A cytochromec 552 has been probed using fluorescence emission spectroscopy. The emission of ANS is significantly increased when the molecule is bound in a nonpolar environment. ANS is therefore often used as a probe for exposed hydrophobic groups in proteins (22Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar, 28Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar,29Cardamone M. Puri N.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 589-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). For cytochrome c 552 no fluorescence enhancement was observed for samples of the holo C11A/C14A protein or the urea-denatured protein, a result in accord with the fully folded and fully unfolded nature of these states. A significant enhancement of fluorescence intensity and a blue shift of the emission maximum was, however, observed for ANS in the presence of apo C11A/C14A cytochromec 552 (Fig.2 a). This enhancement of fluorescence in the presence of the apoprotein could result from ANS binding in the heme pocket of cytochromec 552, as found for apomyoglobin and apohemoglobin (22Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar), or from its binding to exposed hydrophobic surfaces as observed for many molten globule states (30Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate these possibilities we first determined that the number of ANS binding sites per protein molecule is 1.01 ± 0.02 by analyzing the fluorescence intensity as a function of the concentration of added ANS. We then followed the changes in fluorescence emission of ANS in a sample of apo C11A/C14A cytochrome c 552 on the addition of hemin and observed a stepwise linear reduction in the fluorescence enhancement to a value indicative of the absence of specific binding of ANS (Fig. 2, b and c). This latter result suggests that the single ANS binding site is in the heme pocket of the apo state and that ANS is displaced by a heme group to form the holo state during the titration. The binding of ANS does not appear to alter significantly the structure of apo C11A/C14A cytochromec 552 as no change in the far UV CD spectrum was observed for this state on the addition of ANS. Taken together, these observations suggest that ANS binds in effect exclusively in the heme binding pocket and therefore indicate that the heme pocket is at least partially formed in the apo state of the protein. Non-native states of proteins are, in general, best described as ensembles of interconverting conformers. The reconstitution of the holo form of C11A/C14A cytochrome c 552 observed to take place following the addition of heme to a solution of the apoprotein could be anticipated if most of the conformers present in the apo state ensemble are partially folded and contain a nascent heme binding site. Alternatively, similar reconstitution could occur if unfolded random coil conformations predominated in the apoprotein ensemble, but these conformers were in rapid equilibrium with a small proportion of significantly folded protein. In this case heme binding by the folded structures would displace the conformational equilibrium in favor of further adoption of the folded state resulting in reconstitution of the entire population. The effective hydrodynamic radius of 16.6 ± 0.28 Å for the apo state of C11A/C14A cytochrome c 552 reported here provides strong evidence for the first of these proposals and that the population of highly unfolded states is very low. To obtain a measured value of the hydrodynamic radius within ∼10% of that of the native protein, the conformational ensemble of the apo state must contain predominantly highly compact conformers. The CD data show that these conformers contain, on average, ∼14% helical structure (compared with 43% in the native protein). The stoichiometric binding of ANS to the apoprotein and its reversal by the addition of hemin suggest that, in common with apohemoglobin and apomyoglobin, the ANS occupies at least part of a nascent heme binding site. However, strictly speaking the ANS binding site of the apo b-type variant of cytochromec 552 could be separate from the heme binding site, with occupancy of the latter by heme causing abolition of the ANS binding site. This, however, seems the less likely of the two explanations for the reversal of ANS binding by heme. These results for cytochrome c 552 contrast strongly with the conclusions of studies of mitochondrial cytochromec that show that the apo state of this protein resembles a random coil under similar conditions. It is interesting to consider the reasons for the different characteristics of the apo states of these two proteins. Cytochrome c 552 comes from the thermophilic bacterium H. thermophilus that grows optimally at 70 °C, and the holo structure of wild type cytochromec 552 is stable to temperatures in excess of 100 °C. The stability of mitochondrial cytochrome c is, however, lower with a denaturation temperature (Tm) of 67 °C for the oxidized state (31Sinha A. Yadav S. Ahmad R. Ahmad F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Comparisons have been made of the structures and sequences of homologous proteins from thermophiles and mesophiles (32Jaenicke R. Bohm G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) including a comparative study of cytochrome c 552 fromH. thermophilus and the homologous cytochromec 551 from mesophilic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33Hasegawa J. Shimahara H. Mizutani M. Uchiyama S. Arai H. Ishii M. Kobayashi Y. Ferguson S.J. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol.

One feature identified that may be important in promoting the thermal stability of H. thermophiluscytochrome c 552 is the high density of hydrophobic side chains in the core of this protein (34Hasegawa J. Uchiyama S. Tanimoto Y. Mizutani M. Kobayashi Y. Sambongi Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37824-37828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is possible that this extensive network of hydrophobic side chains in cytochrome c 552 may also be responsible, at least in part, for the compact partially folded nature of its apo state. Collapsed hydrophobic cores are in general recognized to be a characteristics of compact non-native states of proteins (30Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Dobson C.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 6-12Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 36Shortle D.R. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Biol. 1997; 4: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and the network of side chains in cytochromec 552 may promote the formation of such a hydrophobic core even in the apo state of the protein. In contrast to mitochondrial cytochrome c, the apo states ofb-type cytochromes that have been studied, such as those of cytochromes b 562 and b 5, adopt conformations that are highly native-like (2Feng Y.Q. Sligar S.G. Wand A.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 38Feng Y.Q. Wand A.J. Sligar S.G.

These apo states contain almost native levels of secondary structure and have essentially the same folds as the holoproteins, although they do have a degree of disorder in their tertiary interactions, and residues in their heme binding pocket are solvent-exposed. The apo state of C11A/C14A cytochrome c 552 has significantly less structure than the apo forms of b-type cytochromes that have been characterized. Most notably the apo state of C11A/C14A cytochromec 552 has 29% less helical secondary structure than the holo state. However, NMR studies of a number of non-native states of proteins have identified that compact conformers within a non-native ensemble are likely to have at least some highly native-like characteristics (41Gillespie J.R. Shortle D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 170-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 42Schwalbe H. Fiebig K.M. Buck M. Jones J.A. Grimshaw S.B. Spencer A. Glaser S.J. Smith L.J. Dobson C.M.

Biol. 2000; 297: 1217-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It is therefore interesting to postulate that the partially folded ensemble of the apo state of cytochromec 552 may contain a significant population of conformers with a native-like overall fold despite the reduced amount of persistent secondary structure. This characteristic would be consistent with the proposed nascent heme binding pocket within the apo state and would provide a mechanism by which such conformers can readily convert into the native state following the binding of heme."

This degradation is due to functions of endogenous degradative enzymes, such as autolysins (peptidoglycan hydrolases), proteases, phospholipases, RNases, and DNases. Evidence has shown that a variety of structures and functions in bacterial cell are damaged by heat stress, but the relationship between the damage and cell death is still unclear. Among those, DNA and its functions should be of critical importance for cell survival. Earlier physiological studies have dealt with the effect of heat on the production of single and double strand DNA breaks. In Escherichia coli, the occurrence of single strand breaks at a lethal temperature of 52 °C was first demonstrated by Bridges et al. (1Bridges B.A. Ashwood-Smith M.J. Munson R.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1969; 58: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and afterward, it was reported that the double strand break was also incurred on DNA by in vivo heating at the same temperature (2Woodcock E. Grigg G.W. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 237: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although a single strand break has been detected by using the alkaline sucrose gradient technique (3McGranth R.A. Williams R.W. Nature. 1966; 212: 534-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), this technique also picks up apurinic sites in DNA strands (4Crine P. Verly W.G. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In E. coli, endonuclease IV is a representative DNA repair enzyme. After exposure to 52 °C, an E. coli mutant defective in this enzyme demonstrates only 20–30% of the viability of the wild type strain (5Grecz N. Bhatarakamol S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 1183-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because endonuclease IV is a major endonuclease acting on apurinic sites in E. coli DNA, it may be involved in the first stage of the DNA excision-repair pathway. The mutant had less DNA breaks after heat treatment, confirming that the production of DNA breaks in this case is part of the DNA repair process. Cold shock has also been reported on E. coli to result in DNA damage as well as cell death (6Hegarty C.P. Weeks O.B. J. Bacteriol. 1940; 39: 475-484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sato M. Takahashi H. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1968; 14: 417-428Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 8Sato M. Takahashi H. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1970; 16: 279-290Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that one possible mechanism for cold shock lethality is the loss of magnesium ion from cells, leading to the inactivation of the magnesium-dependent DNA ligase, which joins phosphodeoxyribo-linkage gaps in the strand produced during the DNA replication and repair processes (8Sato M. Takahashi H. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1970; 16: 279-290Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As for Bacillus subtilis cells, only few studies have been carried out on lethal cold shock and heat shock (9Kadota H. Uchida A. Sako Y. Harada K. Chambliss G. Vary J.C. Spore. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1978: 27-30Google Scholar, 10Svarachorn A. Tsuchido T. Shinmyo A. Takano T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1991; 71: 281-283Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It has been reported that peptidoglycan-degradative autolytic enzymes are activated by cold shock to induce cell lysis and subsequent death (10Svarachorn A. Tsuchido T. Shinmyo A. Takano T. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1991; 71: 281-283Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 11Yamanaka K. Araki J. Takano M. Sekiguchi J. FEMS Microbiol.

In our preliminary experiment, however, when a B. subtilisautolysins deficient mutant, FJ2 strain, was exposed to cold shock treatment, it still demonstrated about 50% reduction in viability. 1J. J. Sakamoto, M. Sasaki, and T. Tsuchido, unpublished data. We have therefore presumed that some additional factor(s), other than the autolysis induction, are involved in the cold shock-induced death and hypothesized the DNA damage as one of them. In another study, in fact, we have reported that DNA is cleaved inB. subtilis 168 cells by a certain endogenous DNase after cold and heat shock treatments. 2J. J. Sakamoto, K. Minami, and T. Tsuchido, submitted for publication. The resultant DNA fragmentation was only detected in the presence of Ca2+or Mn2+ in a minimal synthetic medium and was also observed with the above B. subtilis FJ2 cells, suggesting that cell lysis is not a prerequisite for the intracellular DNA degradation. We have further concluded that the DNA fragmentation is caused by the 39-kDa nuclease.2 In this study, we purified and characterized this DNase from B. subtilis 168 and then identified its encoding gene. Furthermore, we constructed its knock-out mutant to investigate the relationship between the DNA cleavage level and the viability of cells exposed to thermal shock treatments and also to obtain a clue of understanding the physiological role of YokF nuclease.

The cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in TM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl plus 10 mmMgCl2, pH 8.0) containing 1 mmPMSF.3 The cells were disrupted by incubation with 5 mg ml−1 lysozyme for 1 h in ice-cold water. The resultant lysate was centrifuged at 8,500 × g for 5 min and washed twice with TM buffer. The pellet was suspended in TM buffer containing 1 mm PMSF and 1% Nonidet P-40, and the suspension was sonicated gently in ice-cold water for 1 h with an ultrasonic automatic washer (US-1; NSD Co.). After the homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 15 min, the resultant fluid was filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane (DISMIC-25cs, Advantec). The filtrate was applied to a phosphocellulose P11 column (bed volume, 40 ml; Whatman), and then the column was washed with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm PMSF, pH 8.9) using a step-up shift to 80 mm NaCl and then was eluted with a linear gradient of 80–240 mm NaCl. Fractions containing activity were collected, and the activity was concentrated by ultrafiltration with a Q0100 membrane (Advantec, molecular mass of 10,000 cut) under conditions equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Hepes-NaOH, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm PMSF, pH 8.0). The sample was applied to a Resource S column (bed volume, 6 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with buffer B containing 40 mm NaCl and then eluted with a linear gradient of 40–100 mm NaCl. Fractions containing activity were pooled and diluted with fresh buffer A. The sample was applied to a HiTrap-Heparin column (bed volume, 5 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A containing 80 mm NaCl and then eluted with a linear gradient of 80–160 mm NaCl. DNase or RNase activity was measured by evaluating the degree of fragmentation of B. subtilis 168 chromosomal DNA (2 μg; assay 1), supercoiled pUC19 plasmid DNA (5 μg; assay 2), single strand M13mp19 DNA (10 μg; assay 3) in 1% agarose gel, or total B. subtilis 168 RNA (10 μg; assay 4) in Tris/boric acid/EDTA/PAGE (6% gel). The reaction mixture (total volume, 15 μl) for assay of endonuclease activity contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mm CaCl2, 3 mm MgCl2, and 0.01% Triton X-100. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for various periods and then stopped by addition of EDTA at a final concentration of 10 mm. DNase activity was assayed by measuring the amount of chromosomal DNA under a 9.4 kilobase trace × optical density level/1 min of reaction time/1 μg of protein (using Image Master, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To construct knock-out plasmids and overexpression plasmids of endonuclease encoding genes, we first searched for DNA endonuclease homolog genes in B. subtilis 168 using the BLAST homology search system based on theB. subtilis genome project data base and DDBJ data base and found five unknown genes, ywjD, yqfS,yokF, yncB, and yosQ. These genes, which were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the B. subtilis 168 chromosomal DNA with oligonucleotide primers, and thenucA gene derived from pHS19 were cloned into pET-19b or pET-21a to generate the overexpression plasmids pET-21a-yokF, pET-21a-yokF-His, pET-21a-yncB, pET-21a-nucA, pET-19b-ywjD, pET-19b-yqfS, and pET-19b-yosQ. The knock-out plasmids pBluescriptII KS(+)-yokF-Cmr, pBluescriptII KS(+)-yokF-Nmr, pUC18-yncB-Cmr, pUC18-yncB-Tcr, pUC19-nucA-Tcr, pBluescriptII KS(+)-ywjD-Cmr, pBluescriptII KS(+)-yqfS-Cmr, and pUC18-yosQ-Cmr, were generated by subcloning of polymerase chain reaction products or nucA gene followed by ligation with Cmr, Nmr, or Tcr cartridge from pMSG-CAT, pBEST513, or pHY300PLK, respectively. The knock-out plasmids were digested with an appropriate restriction enzyme to be linearized for subsequent knock-out of chromosomal endonuclease genes by homologous recombination. The target mutants were selected on L agar plates containing 4 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol, 7 μg ml−1 neomycin, or 10 μg ml−1 tetracycline, depending on the type of antibiotic for resistance. Heat shock treatment was performed in medium by transfer of a flask containing cells from an incubator at 37 °C to another at 55 °C followed by incubation 55 °C for 30 min with shaking.2 For cold shock treatment, after the cells were concentrated by centrifugation (8,500 × g, 5 min, 25 °C), their suspension was diluted 10-fold with ice-cold medium at 0 °C and then kept for 30 min at this temperature.2 After that, the cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cell samples were appropriately diluted and plated on L agar. After cultivation, the colonies were counted. In part of experiments, we also used the growth delay method (17Takano M. Tsuchido T. J. Ferment. Technol. 1982; 60: 189-198Google Scholar) in which an automatic growth-recording incubator, Bioscanner OT-BS48 (Ohtake Works, Tokyo), was employed. The G10 values, defined as the time delay when the inoculum is decreased to one-tenth for the culture to reach an A 650 of 0.15, were 0.99 and 1.03 h for the wild type and yokF mutant, respectively. DNA fragmentation was evaluated as described elsewhere2 by using a modification of Ishizawa's method (18Ishizawa M. Kobayashi Y. Miyamura T. Matsuura S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5792Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). For the identification of DNA endonuclease activity and the estimation of molecular mass, zymographic analysis was used with several modifications (19Rosenthal A.L. Lacks S.A. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 80: 76-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), as described elsewhere.2 We used E. coli JM109 (DE3) strains carrying the DNA endonuclease homolog encoding plasmid for heterogeneous expression. Transformants were grown at 37 °C in L broth containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin to an A 650 of ∼0.6 corresponding to the middle exponential phase, and then 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture. The culture was further incubated for 3 h and then centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was suspended in and washed twice with TM buffer and then resuspended in TM buffer containing 2 mmPMSF and 10 mm EDTA. After ultrasonication of the suspension, part of the resulting cell-free extract was supplied for DNase assay. Another part was mixed with SDS sample buffer, and the suspension was boiled for 4 min at 100 °C and then subjected to zymographic SDS-PAGE. Competent cells of B. subtilis cells were prepared by a modification of Spizizen's method (15Spizizen J. Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One ml of the overnight culture was inoculated into 20 ml of Spizizen salts medium supplemented with 5 g liter−1 glucose, 50 mg liter−1l-tryptophan, and 1 mg liter−1 casamino acids. After the cells were starved by incubation at 37 °C for 220 min, 4 ml of the culture was taken out and mixed with 36 ml of Spizizen salts medium supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 5 mg liter−1l-tryptophan. The resulting competent cells (1 ml of culture) were incubated for 30 min with 2 μg of pHY300PLK plasmid. The culture was then diluted twice with double strength L broth and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Part of the culture (100 μl) was plated on L agar containing 20 μg ml−1 tetracycline hydrochloride, and the plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. An overnight culture of B. subtilis was inoculated in DNA minimal salts medium consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 g liter−1(NH4)2SO4, 1 g liter−1 sodium citrate, 1.5 g liter−1sodium glutamate, 5 g liter−1 glucose, 5 g liter−1 NaCl, 5 g liter−1 KCl, 20 mg liter−1l-tryptophan, and 600 mg liter−1 E. coli BL21(DE3) chromosomal DNA, to grow in the above medium. The culture grown in L broth to early exponential phase was diluted 100-fold with KS buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5). The cell suspension was inoculated into L broth containing mitomycin C at a final concentration of 44 ng ml−1, and the culture was shaken at 37 °C in a Bioscanner OT-BS-48 described above. Our other study has demonstrated that the nucA gene product is not the factor of thermal shock-induced DNA fragmentation, because the nucAmutant and its parent 168 strain have similar levels of both DNase activity in their cell-free extracts and DNA cleavage in vivo.2 Therefore, we cultivated the nucAmutant in L broth containing MgCl2 and CaCl2both at 1 mm for purification of the 39-kDa nuclease. The nuclease was purified by successive chromatographies on P11 phosphocellulose column, Resource S column, and heparin-agarose column with elution of its activity on NaCl gradients of 127–200, 46–78, and 118–149 mm, respectively. Silver staining and zymography analyses revealed that the target DNase was purified as a single band (Fig. 1). A summary of the purification is shown in Table II. The 39-kDa nuclease was purified eventually above 220-fold with a yield of 34%.Table IIPurification of the 39-kDa nuclease from B. subtilisStepProteinTotal ActivitySpecific ActivityPurificationYieldmgunitsunits mg −1fold%NP4027613,800501100P1110.911,9901,1002287Resource S61.609,6646,040120.870Heparin0.434,71410,963219.334The Nonidet P-40 solubilized fraction was prepared from about 3.2 × 1013 B. subtilis 168 nucA mutant cells. Open table in a new tab The Nonidet P-40 solubilized fraction was prepared from about 3.2 × 1013 B. subtilis 168 nucA mutant cells. We characterized the purified 39-kDa nuclease by the DNA fragmentation assay, in which B. subtilis 168 chromosomal DNA was supplied as a substrate. This nuclease was inhibited by 0.1 mmaurintricalboxylic acid, but not by 1 mm ZnCl2, MnCl2, and HgCl2 (data not shown). It required Ca2+, Cu2+, or Mn2+ for its activity. 2-Mercaptoethanol and sodium citrate had no inhibitory effect. Neither stimulatory nor inhibitory effects were observed with ATP. The optimum pH of 39-kDa nuclease activity was 7.0–8.0, and the optimum temperature was between 40 and 45 °C. This enzyme was rather heat stable. After incubated for 30 min, the enzyme was fully active at 25–55 °C, but the relative activity was reduced to 60% at 60–75 °C and to 40% at 80–100 °C. The 39-kDa enzyme cleaved supercoiled double and single strand DNA from M13 mp19 phage and RNA from B. subtilis as substrates, indicating that this enzyme is a nuclease (Fig. 2). To determine the gene encoding this nuclease, we constructed several mutants deficient in DNA endonuclease homolog-encoding genes, includingyncB, yokF, yosQ, yqfS, andywjD, which were detected with the BLAST homology search system. Products of open reading frames encoding these genes have not been identified, and their expression and functions have not been characterized yet. The resultant product analyses of these mutants revealed that the yokF gene encoded a 39-kDa nuclease but also a 28-kDa nuclease on zymogram (Fig. 3). The latter enzyme was presumed to be a proteolytically processed but still active form like the 39-kDa type. Further, a 26-kDa enzyme having a weak DNase activity was identified to be the yncB gene product (Fig. 3 A). Therefore, both yokF and yncB genes were not pseudo-genes. The YokF protein consisted of 296 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 32,000, and it was a basic protein with pI 8.9. TheyokF gene was localized in the SPβ prophage region, and the sequence of 20 amino acid residues at the N terminus had a feature of a signal peptide with a −3LXXC+1lipobox cleavage site motif of lipoprotein (20Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), suggesting the ability of YokF to associate with the cytoplasmic membrane. The YokF nuclease was a homolog of a member of the thermonuclease family fromStaphylococcus groups and highly resembled to B. subtilis YncB, which was also presumed to be a lipoprotein as a paralog (21Kunst F. Ogasawara N. Moszer I. Albertini A.M. Alloni G. Azevedo V. Bertero M.G. Bessieres P. Bolotin A. Borchert S. Boriss R. Bousier L. Brans A. Braun M. Brignell S.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar). In ywjD, yqfS, and yosQ deficient mutants, all DNase activity bands detected remained on the zymogram (Fig. 3 A). In addition, in E. coli JM109 (DE3) carrying plasmids containing ywjD, yqfS, oryosQ gene, no increases in DNase activity were obtained in their cell-free extracts, and no additional bands were seen on zymogram (Fig. 4 A). These results suggest that the products of ywjD-, yqfS-, andyosQ-encoding open reading frames have no activity of cleaving randomly double strand DNA. In another study,2 we have reported that thenucA gene disruption reduces levels of neither DNase activity in the cell-free extract nor in vivo DNA cleavage. To clarify which DNase is involved in the DNA fragmentation caused by thermal stresses, we measured the DNase activities of mutants deficient in yokF and yncB genes. As a result, in the cell-free extract of the yokF mutants, the DNase activity was little detected, whereas the parent strain and yncBmutant had substantial levels of activity (Fig. 5 A). Correspondingly, in cells of the yokF mutant exposed to these stresses, no substantial fragmentation of chromosomal DNA was found (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that YokF is a major DNase in vegetative cells at the exponential growth phase and also that it is a critical factor of thermal stress-induced DNA fragmentation. To know whether the DNA cleavage by YokF nuclease is a cause of thermal shock-induced cell death, we compared survival rates of cells exposed to thermal stresses between the parent strain and yokF mutant. After heat treatment at 55 °C for 30 min, the survival of the yokF mutant was 0.0113%, whereas that of the wild type 0.00396%. After cold shock treatment, the survival of the yokF mutant was 0.76%, whereas that of the wild type 0.31%. A similar result on cold-shocked cells was obtained by using the growth delay analysis method (17Takano M. Tsuchido T. J. Ferment. Technol. 1982; 60: 189-198Google Scholar). The survivals of each strain were 0.0034 and 0.035%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the YokF nuclease is one of the death factors in thermally shocked cells of B. subtilis. To obtain a clue of understanding what is the primary role of YokF nuclease, several phenotypes were compared among single, double, and triple mutants ofyokF, yncB, and nucA genes as well as their parent strain. We found the following characteristics of theyokF mutant different from other mutants and the parent. First, the yokF mutant was found to be sensitive to mitomycin C as an alkylating agent (22Suter W. Jaeger I. Mutat. Res. 1982; 97: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although the growth curves of these strains were similar until about 2 h after inoculation, hereafter, the growth of only yokF-deficient mutant was inhibited by mitomycin C (data not shown). This sensitivity might be induced by accumulation of damaged DNA. Second, the yokFmutant demonstrated an altered ability of competence (Table III). The transformation efficiency in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 of theyokF mutant was 10 times as much as that of the wild type. This result suggests that one of the functions of YokF may possibly be the degradation of extracellular DNA. Third, the yokF mutant was not able to metabolize chromosomal DNA added externally, whereas the parent was able to do so and grew well. In a medium containing chromosomal DNA as a phosphagen and 3 mmCaCl2, the wild type grew faster than the DNase-deficient mutants tested, including yokF mutant. In the absence of CaCl2, all strains tested could not grow. At the exponential growth phase, all strains had little activity of extracellular DNase, and also no individual activities of YokF, YncB, and NucA were detected in the medium (data not shown).Table IIIEffect of DNase-encoding genes deficient mutations on the competence developmentStrainTransformation efficiency3-aTransformation efficiency was calculated as the number of Tcr transformants/1 μg of pHY300PLK DNA.Transformation rate3-bTransformation rate was calculated as the number of Tcr transformants/total cells.CFU TF /1 μg DNACFU TF /CFU Total168852.28 × 10−6yokF7803.04 × 10−5yncB3153.27 × 10−6nucA2002.63 × 10−63-a Transformation efficiency was calculated as the number of Tcr transformants/1 μg of pHY300PLK DNA.3-b Transformation rate was calculated as the number of Tcr transformants/total cells. Open table in a new tab In our other paper,2 we have demonstrated on B. subtilis that cold shock and heat shock treatments cause DNA fragmentation accompanied by cell death and further that the 39-kDa nuclease may be involved in the DNA cleavage. The results obtained in this study strongly substantiate the involvement of this nuclease. From zymographic study B. subtilis 168 vegetative cells apparently have at least three major DNases, YokF (39 kDa and its possibly processed form, 28 kDa), YncB (26 kDa), and NucA (17 kDa) (23Vosman B. Kuiken G. Kooistra J. Venema G. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3703-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24van Sinderen D. Kiewiet R. Venema G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).2 An additional 60-kDa DNase is an inactive enzyme in the cell-free extract and is encoded in an unidentified gene.2 Up to date, the presence of several DNases, including a Ca2+-dependent exonuclease (25Kerr I.M. Pratt E.A. Lehman I.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 20: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), an ATP-dependent nuclease (26Shemyakin M.F. Grepachevsky A.A. Chestukhin A.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 98: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Kooistra J. Venema G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3644-3655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a Mg2+-dependent endonuclease (28Scher B. Dubnau D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 553: 595-602Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 29Scher B. Dubnau D. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 429-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been reported in B. subtilis. Merchante et al. (30Merchante R. Pooley H.M. Karamata D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6176-6183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have found several DNases in the periplasm, membrane, and cytoplasm by using zymogram, and Coughlin et al. (31Coughlin S.A. Green D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have also analyzedB. subtilis DNases by using two-dimensional zymography analysis and detected 83 nuclease spots. However, we wonder whether many of these enzymes are proteolytic products generated during the lysozyme treatment at 37 °C. In fact, we have observed that YokF (39-kDa form) is very sensitive to serine protease in cell-free extract,1 and therefore it seems difficult to detect all DNases as intact forms. Although we attempted to determine the N-terminal amino acid sequence of 39-kDa YokF by the Edman method, we did not succeed because of its blocking by a lipid. From the genome analysis project, YokF and also YncB have been found to possess a putative signal peptide of lipoprotein, called the lipobox cleavage site, LXXC (Ref. 20Tjalsma H. Kontinen V.P. Pragai Z. Wu H. Meima R. Venema G. Bron S. Sarvas M. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1698-1707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholarand Fig. 6). The lipobox-processed YokF is suggested to consist of 277 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 31,000. The modification of cysteine residue in the lipobox of YokF by the diacylglyceryl transferase, Lgt (32Leskela S. Wahlstrom E. Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), is a prerequisite for processing of the lipoprotein precursor by signal peptidase II (33Tjalsma H. Zanen G. Venema G. Bron S. van Dijl J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28191-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of mature YokF protein was indicated to be 39,000 from SDS-PAGE but was 31,000 when we estimated by mass spectrometry. 4J. J. Sakamoto, K. Masuda, and Tsuchido, unpublished data. An overestimated molecular mass obtained with SDS-PAGE is probably due to the presence of a lipid in the molecule and highly basic property. The purified YokF seems to contain no cysteine residues in the active site of the molecule, or the disulfide bond may not be involved in its activity and conformation. The fact that the purified YokF nuclease is not inactivated even after heated at 55 °C for 30 min is consistent with an idea that the DNase is involved in DNA cleavage observed in B. subtilis 168 cells heated to 55 °C.2 In the other study, we have suggested that the 39-kDa YokF is localized in the membrane fraction by using Triton X-114 two-phase preparation system.2 Although NucA has also been reported to be a membrane protein, both NucA and its inhibitor Nin have no signal peptide domain of lipoprotein (23Vosman B. Kuiken G. Kooistra J. Venema G. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3703-3710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24van Sinderen D. Kiewiet R. Venema G. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two examples of nuclease modified with a lipid have been known. One is a Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent DNase purified from the membrane fraction of Mycoplasma penetrans, and its structural genemnuA has already been identified (34Bendjennat M. Blanchard A. Loutfi M. Montagnier L. Bahraoui E. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2210-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Jarvill-Taylor K.J. VanDyk C. Minion F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1853-1860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because MnuA has a signal peptide motif (TISC) of lipoprotein, this is probably the first enzyme identified as a lipoprotein DNase (35Jarvill-Taylor K.J. VanDyk C. Minion F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1853-1860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As another example is a modified S. aureus nuclease constructed for protein secretion study. In this nuclease, its inherent signal peptide I is artificially converted to a signal peptide II of Nlp lipoprotein derived from Lactococcus lactis (36Poquet I. Ehrlich S.D. Gruss A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1904-1912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 28-kDa YokF may possibly be a product processed at a site different from the lipobox cleavage site of YokF molecule, like a secondary cleavage site reported on of Staphylococcus aureus nuclease (37Le Loir Y. Gruss A. Ehrlich S.D. Langella P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1895-1903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Miller J.R. Kovacevic S. Veal L.E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3508-3514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genome project data also show that the yokF gene is located in 194.70° on the chromosome and that its possible promoter has a putative ςA consensus sequence (39Ghim S.Y. Choi S.K. Shin B.S. Jeong Y.M. Sorokin A. Ehrlich S.D. Park S.H. DNA Res. 1998; 5: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 40Lazarevic V. Dusterhoft A. Soldo B. Hilbert H. Mauel C. Karamata D. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 1055-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). TheyncB gene is located at 161.90° (25Kerr I.M. Pratt E.A. Lehman I.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1965; 20: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and similarly has a putative ςA consensus sequence promoter. These two genes are paralog and possibly duplicate genes. Most staphylococcal nucleases are extracellular enzymes that have a signal peptide motif. The thermonuclease family enzymes are highly homologous to YokF and YncB in the central region containing the thermonuclease domain, but the C-terminal region of YokF has no homology with those of any other proteins in a search of the data base (Fig. 6). Our study suggests that the DNA cleavage by YokF nuclease is involved in the death caused by thermal shock treatments, although in part. In bacteria, several studies have reported that nuclease induces cell death (41Kleanthous C. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. James R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 42Ahrenholtz I. Lorenz M.G. Wackernagel W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3746-3751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Handa N. Ichige A. Kusano K. Kobayashi I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2218-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The first example is the system consisting of a DNase toxin colicin E9 and its inhibitor as an immunity protein, both of which are encoded in colicin E9 plasmid. The E. coli cell not carrying colicin E9 plasmid is killed by the E9 DNase because of no inhibitor. As the second example, an artificial suicide system by chromosomal DNA cleavage has been reported on cells of an E. coli recombinant strain, which overexpresses a DNase derived fromSerratia marcescens (42Ahrenholtz I. Lorenz M.G. Wackernagel W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3746-3751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The third example is the induced death of E. coli cells, which have lost the EcoRI restriction modification gene complex (43Handa N. Ichige A. Kusano K. Kobayashi I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2218-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In this strain, a restriction enzyme cleaves chromosomal DNA at unmodified sites, and consequently cells die because of the loss of methylation enzyme-carrying plasmid (43Handa N. Ichige A. Kusano K. Kobayashi I. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2218-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Further, in animal cells, an apoptosis DNase and its inhibitor have been characterized as the CAD/ICAD system, in which CAD is activated by caspase cleavage of ICAD (44Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). Sakahira et al. (45Sakahira H. Enari M. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar) have indicated that CAD is inactivated by ICAD (caspase resistance mutation type) overexpression but that induced cell death is not accompanied by DNA fragmentation in this case. They have speculated that the DNA fragmentation may protect cell from transformation by a DNA derived from some apoptotic cell. In the prophage SPβ region of the B. subtilis chromosome, there are several enzymes for DNA metabolism, besides YokF nuclease, such as dUTPase homolog (YosS), ribonucleotide reductase (BnrdE/BnrdF), UmuC homolog (YobH), RecJ homolog (YorK), and homing endonuclease (YosQ). In particular, dUTPase, BnrdEF, and YokF might have a possible connection with nucleotide synthesis and metabolism. Considering the results obtained in this study, it is likely that YokF may function as a member of a possible cellular DNA recycling system consisting of the degradation of intracellular damaged DNA and reuse of the degraded products. YokF may also work as a cellular self-defense system to protect cell from invasion or infection by an extracellular foreign DNA, plasmid, or bacteriophage, as suggested by an increased ability of competence in yokF mutant. YokF and its homologs might have a role for prevention of horizontal transfer and recombination of genes between bacterial cells in the natural environment. When the extracellular DNA is taken up by a bacterial cell, it may be metabolized at the cytoplasmic membrane for the supply of nucleotide and inorganic phosphate as substrates for the cell itself. Once cells are exposed to thermal shock stress, however, because of induced membrane injury, YokF may be released from the membrane and enter the cytoplasm to attack chromosomal DNA. Further, it might also be likely that, in such stressed cells, YokF plays a role for metabolizing DNA and RNA released from dead cells to supply the resulting products for residual survived cells in the bacterial population. In E. coli, EndA has been known as a periplasmic DNase randomly cleaving double strand DNA (46Jekel M. Wackernagel W. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 154: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and endA mutants have been so far used for providing plasmid DNA at a high yield and of highly quality because of demonstrating little DNase activity (13Lin J.J. Proc. Natl. Sci. Counc. Repub. China. B. 1992; 16: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar, 47Taylor R.G. Walker D.C. McInnes R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1677-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). It is also possible, therefore, that a YokF nuclease deficient mutant is used for efficient plasmid DNA production in B. subtilisin laboratory work as well as for industrial application. We thank Dr. Katsuyoshi Masuda of Suntory Institute for Bioorganic Research for mass spectrometry analysis of YokF protein, Prof. Yasutaro Fujita (Department of Biotechnology, Fukuyama University) for providing pBEST513, Dr. Yoshinobu Matsumura in this laboratory for discussion and Prof. Tai Tokuyama (Kansai University) for encouragement through this study."
https://openalex.org/W2044818181,"Previously, we identified a minimum core promoter of the mouse δ-opioid receptor (DOR) gene. The DOR promoter contains an E-box that binds upstream stimulatory factor and is crucial for the DOR promoter activity in NS20Y cells, a mouse neuronal cell line that constitutively expresses DOR. In the present study, we further analyzed the DOR promoter in NS20Y cells and have demonstrated that transcription factor Ets-1 binds to an Ets-1-binding site overlapping the E-box and trans-activates the DOR promoter by synergizing with upstream stimulatory factor in specific DNA binding. In addition, the Ets-1 DNA-binding domain is sufficient to play the functional role of Ets-1 in trans-activating the DOR promoter. Furthermore, through in vivo cross-linking assays and Northern blot analyses, we have demonstrated that Ets-1 binds to the DOR promoter in the neonatal mouse brain and that overexpressed Ets-1 can significantly enhance the expression of DOR mRNA in primary neonatal mouse neuronal cells. Collectively, our data suggest that Ets-1 functions as a trans-activator of the DOR promoter in the neonatal mouse brain and thus may contribute to the development of the mouse brain DOR system."

T cell receptor(s) peptide-class I major histocompatibility complex(es) altered peptide ligand major histocompatibility complex high pressure liquid chromatography 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Clonotypic T cell receptors (TcR)1 recognize foreign or unnatural peptides bound to self class I MHC on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. These peptides are typically derived from proteins that are synthesized within the cell and are subsequently degraded by the proteasome. Thus, the peptides presented on the surface of a cell signal the peptidic contents or the “state” of the cell. When cytotoxic T cells recognize class I MHC-peptide complexes (pMHC) as nonnative or foreign, the cells bearing these pMHC are lysed (1Ploegh H.L. Science. 1998; 280: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In an unexpected manner, many host T cells are also activated by the presence of foreign pMHC, and this is a major factor in graft rejection of transplanted tissues. Thus, the mechanism of peptide-specific allo- or xenoreactivity is of great interest to transplant physicians. The interaction between a TcR and class I MHC is not an “all or nothing” event. Altered peptide ligands (APLs) that only differ slightly from the original peptide lead to a continuum of different effects when presented to T cells (2Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 3Loftus D.J. Squarcina P. Nielsen M.B. Geisler C. Castelli C. Odum N. Appella E. Parmiani G. Rivoltini L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2433-2439PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon the outcome of T cell activation, APLs may be defined as agonists or super agonists, which trigger similar or improved T cell responses compared with the original peptide ligand. APLs may also be null peptides that completely fail to stimulate any response either because of a failure to produce a productive signal upon engagement of the TcR or a failure to interact with the TcR at all. Furthermore, APLs may be antagonists. These APLs inhibit the ability of CTL to kill cells bearing the natural agonist peptide. The critical physical constants between pMHC and TcR that control the triggering of T cell activation are unknown. Early experiments using live T cells and antigen-presenting cells equated T cell activity to affinity of TcR for pMHC (2Kersh G.J. Allen P.M. Nature. 1996; 380: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, a number of surface plasmon resonance experiments with soluble forms of pMHC and TcR indicate that the differences in the activity of agonist, antagonist, and null pMHC complexes are primarily due to variations in the off rates, or half-life, of the interaction (4Kersh G.J.

Finally, some researchers have found that neither affinity nor kinetics correlate with the differences in T cell outcome (8Baker M.B. Gagnon J.S. Biddison E.W. Wiley C.D. Immunity. 2000; 13: 475-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Although surface plasmon resonance experiments are valuable because they allow us to determine the kinetics and thermodynamics of the interaction between pMHC and TcR, these measurements fail to account for the involvement of co-receptors and accessory molecules on the cell surface that are also critical in T cell and antigen-presenting cell interactions, particularly when the affinity of the TcR to pMHC complex is low (9Bromley S.K. Burack W.R. Johnson K.G. Somersalo K. Sims T.N. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 375-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar, 10Dustin M.L.

In an attempt to determine a physical mechanism that controls the signals that result in different T cell activities, the crystal structures of TcR A6 in complex with four different peptide-A2 complexes (one agonist, one weak agonist, and two weak antagonists) have been determined (17Ding Y.H. Baker B.M. Garboczi D.N. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. Immunity. 1999; 11: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). No physical mechanism is immediately apparent; the crystal structures of these complexes are almost identical. There are no significant conformational changes in the domain structure of the TcR that are triggered by engagement of an agonist versus antagonist that may explain the differing biological consequences. Although these findings show that T cell outcome is not a direct consequence of universal structural changes, this does not rule out the possibility that small, localized changes to the TcR binding surface could affect the affinity or kinetics of the pMHC-TcR interaction, which in turn may have an effect on the resulting T cell outcome. For example, the structures of antagonist human immunodeficiency virus-1 gag peptides bound to HLA-B8 exhibited changes in the peptide, to the MHC as a result of changes in the peptide, and to the antigen-binding cleft (23Reid S.W. McAdam S. Smith K.J. Klenerman P. O'Callaghan C.A. Harlos K. Jakobsen B.K. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), suggesting that there were alterations in the molecular structure linked to biological activity. Additional crystal structures are required to probe each possibility. The murine AHIII12.2 T cell clone recognizes class I molecule H-2Db (Db) in complex with a synthetic peptide p1058 (sequence FAPGFFPYL) and several variants based on this sequence (24Loftus D.J. Chen Y. Covell D.G. Engelhard V.H. Appella E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3651-3658PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this murine CD8 T cell clone also recognizes a xenogeneic (human) class I MHC HLA-A2.1 (A2) in complex with peptide p1049 (sequence ALWGFFPVL) (25Henderson R.A. Cox A.L. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10275-10279Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Our previous comparison of the x-ray crystal structures of A2-p1049 and Db/p1027 (also recognized by AHIII12.2) demonstrates that the molecular surfaces recognized by this TcR are not similar (26Zhao R. Loftus D.J. Appella E. Collins E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), indicating that molecular mimicry does not play a significant role in the recognition of dissimilar pMHC by this T cell clone. Exactly how the TcR could recognize two very different molecular surfaces is still not known. While examining the recognition of altered peptide ligands by AHIII12.2, we found that the Db-binding peptide, p1058, also binds to HLA-A2.1. Furthermore, when bound to A2, p1058 is antagonistic to p1049 function on AHIII12.2 T cells. To explore the differential recognition of p1049 and p1058 when bound to A2, we synthesized a panel of chimeric peptides derived from p1058 that progress to p1049 and vice versa. Substitutions in p1049 or p1058 result in agonist, antagonist, and null peptides. To probe molecular recognition of xenogeneic class I MHC, we determined the structures of an antagonist (p1058), a weak agonist (p1049-F6V), and a null peptide (p1049-F5V) bound to A2. In results similar to those obtained by the Ding et al. studies (17Ding Y.H. Baker B.M. Garboczi D.N. Biddison W.E. Wiley D.C. Immunity. 1999; 11: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), and unlike the Reid et al. study (23Reid S.W. McAdam S. Smith K.J. Klenerman P. O'Callaghan C.A. Harlos K. Jakobsen B.K. McMichael A.J. Bell J.I. Stuart D.I. Jones E.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we see no large structural changes that suggest reasons for the differences in biological activity. However, the structures do provide a rationale for differences in activities observed. Furthermore, using multimeric pMHC complexes, we find that the differences in biological activity may be explained by differences in affinity of the pMHC antigen for the TcR on the surface of AHIII12.2 T cells. The Peptide Synthesis Facility at the National Cancer Institute (National Institutes of Health) synthesized all peptides used in this study. The peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC (>95%), and their identity was confirmed by laser desorption time of flight mass spectrometry. The purified peptides were dissolved in 100% Me2SO at 20 mg ml−1 by weight.

Lytic activity of CTL toward the altered peptides was performed by a standard 4-h 51Cr release assay as described previously (24Loftus D.J. Chen Y. Covell D.G. Engelhard V.H. Appella E. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3651-3658PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, between 1.5 × 104 and 2.5 × 104 AHIII12.2 T cells were incubated with 5000 peptide-pulsed 51Cr-labeled target cells as described in the legend to Fig. 1 and Table I. Since p1049 is a human self-antigen, human cell lines could not be used to assay CTL activity of variant peptides. Another benefit of using murine cells is that the xenogenicity eliminates many of the differences among auxiliary molecules that might also influence the quality of the TcR-pMHC interaction. Murine EE2H3 cells, which do not normally express any class I MHC (27Silverman T. Rein A. Orrison B. Langloss J. Bratthauer G. Miyazaki J. Ozato K. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 4378-4387PubMed Google Scholar), were transfected with an A2 heavy chain covalently linked to human β2m and used as target cells (28Bikoff E.K. Otten G.R. Robertson E.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1997-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Antagonist activity was assayed as described previously (3Loftus D.J. Squarcina P. Nielsen M.B. Geisler C. Castelli C. Odum N. Appella E. Parmiani G. Rivoltini L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2433-2439PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, this entailed incubating target cells (either EE2H3 or CHO-A2) with a suboptimal concentration of p1049 (50 nm) for 2 h, to generate 20–40% of the maximum specific lysis of AHIII12.2. Cells were washed and plated to microwells containing a 10 μmconcentration of the test peptide or no peptide. After a further 1-h incubation, CTL activity was measured as described above. The percentage of inhibition was calculated as in Ref. 29Sykulev Y. Vugmeyster Y. Brunmark A. Ploegh H.L. Eisen H.N. Immunity. 1998; 9: 475-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar. Cell surface stabilization of A2 in the presence of variant peptides were performed as previously described (30Pogue R.R. Eron J. Frelinger J.A. Matsui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8166-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 × 105 T-2 cells (ATCC number CRL-1992) were incubated overnight in AIM V serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in the presence of 100 nmhuman β2m and peptide at concentrations from 10 to 0.1 μm. Cells were then stained with the monoclonal antibody BB7.2, specific for HLA-A2, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnology Associates). Cells were analyzed using flow cytometry (FACScan; Becton Dickinson), and the mean channel fluorescence was determined using the CYCLOPS software package (Cytomation; Fort Collins, CO). All data were normalized to the percentage of mean channel fluorescence for p1049 bound to A2 at 10 μm. The determination of cell surface half-lives of peptide-A2 complexes (t) was performed as described previously (30Pogue R.R. Eron J. Frelinger J.A. Matsui M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8166-8170Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 × 105 T2 cells were incubated overnight in AIM V serum-free medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in the presence of 10 μm peptide. To block vesicle transport, cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640, 15% fetal calf serum, and 10 μg ml−1 brefeldin A (Sigma). Since prolonged exposure to this concentration of brefeldin A is toxic, the cells were transferred to 0.5 μg ml−11 h later. This concentration is sufficient to maintain the vesicle transport block. At the indicated time points, cells were removed, incubated with BB7.2, and analyzed by flow cytometry as detailed above (cell surface stabilization assay). Each time point was evaluated as mean fluorescence with peptide minus mean fluorescence without peptide. Large quantities of heavy chain residues 1–274 and human β2m were produced as inclusion bodies inEscherichia coli (26Zhao R. Loftus D.J. Appella E. Collins E.J. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 359-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), purified, and folded in vitro as previously described (31Garboczi D.N. Hung D.T. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3429-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The folded pMHC complexes were concentrated using an ultrafiltration cell (Amicon) and purified by HPLC gel filtration chromatography (Phenomenex, Biosep-SEC-S2000). All pMHC complexes were crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution for A2-p1058 contained 14% polyethylene glycol 6000 in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5. The reservoir solution for A2-p1049-F6V and p1049-F5V is similar to that for A2-p1058, with the exception of 16% polyethylene glycol 6000 rather than 14%. The hanging drop for every complex was a 1:1 mixture of the reservoir solution and the protein solution, which contained 10 mg/ml protein in 25 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5. Microseeding was necessary for all complexes to obtain crystals suitable for crystallographic studies. Crystals of pMHC complexes were stored in 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, containing 20% polyethylene glycol 6000. These crystals were transferred directly into the storage buffer plus 25% glycerol and were immediately placed in the cryostream (generated by the Oxford Cryo System, 100K). The diffraction data for A2-p1058 and A2-p1049-F6V were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on station X12-B, and the diffraction data for p1049-F5V were collected on a Rigaku R-Axis IIC using Cu Kα radiation. All diffraction data were processed using the programs Denzo and Scalepack.

Open table in a new tab The structures of all complexes were determined using the Molecular Replacement method with the CCP4 program suite. The complex of A2 and a peptide from human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase (32Madden D.R. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 693-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) was used as a model for all three structural solutions. The orientation and position of these models were determined using the program AMoRe in CCP4. Solvent flattening and 2-fold averaging using the program DM in the CCP4 suite were applied to improve the quality of the density. Manual model building into the electron density was performed with the program O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Computational refinement was performed using the program CNS (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Rigid body refinement was carried out using three domains: α1/α2, α3, and β2m. Simulated annealing was used at early stages of the refinement. Energy minimization was carried out using the maximum likelihood target with amplitudes. Bulk solvent and anisotropic B corrections were applied through the refinement process. Cycles of manual model rebuilding and refinement were carried out untilR free and R factors were converged. Water molecules were then added with Arp (35Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Carter C.W.J. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part B: Advances in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 269Google Scholar). Individual Bfactor refinement was performed as the final step of refinement. Refinement was continued with added water untilR free was converged. The final refinement statistics are shown in Table II. Recombinant MHC protein was prepared as described above, except the MHC heavy chain contained a BirA recognition sequence at the C terminus that allowed for site-specific biotinylation. Purified pMHC complexes were biotinylated using the methods provided by the manufacturer (Avidity, Denver, CO). Excess biotin was removed with three subsequent buffer exchanges in a Centriprep filtration device (Amicon) with 10-kDa membrane. Incubation of biotin-labeled protein with streptavidin (Sigma), followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis without boiling or reducing agent, was used to assess the extent of biotinylation. Properly biotinylated pMHC complexes supershift with streptavidin added. To make pMHC tetramer complexes, avidin-PE (Leinco, St. Louis, MO) was added to biotinylated pMHC monomers. After a 15-min incubation on ice, monoclonal anti-PE antibody (Sigma) was added to the tetramers to form octamers. For binding assays, the octamer complexes were added at the indicated concentrations to 2 × 105 AHIII12.2 T cells. After a 45-min incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed three times and analyzed for median fluorescence by flow cytometry (FACscan; Becton Dickinson). For half-life assays, 8 × 105 AHIII12.2 T cells were stained with 350 nm of the indicated octamers for 45 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times and then resuspended in a solution containing the monoclonal antibody BB7.2 (purified from hybridoma supernatant) at 50 μg/ml. At the indicated time points, aliquots of the cells were added to wash buffer containing 1% formalin and analyzed for median fluorescence by flow cytometry (FACScan; Becton Dickinson). As a negative control in both experiments, octamers composed of HLA-A2.1 complexed to an irrelevant peptide (MLLSVPLLL) were used. The median fluorescence of the A2-MLL octamers at each concentration or time point was subtracted in each experiment. During our studies of AHIII12.2 recognition of structurally disparate ligands, it was discovered that p1058, recognized as an agonist by AHIII12.2 when bound to Db, also binds to the human class I MHC A2 and is recognized weakly (Fig. 1 A). In order to study reactivity of AHIII12.2 T cells to the two different ligands when bound to A2, a chimeric series of peptides were constructed that progressively changed p1049 into p1058 and conversely p1058 into p1049 as shown in Table I. These peptides showed various abilities to be recognized by AHIII12.2 (Fig. 1 A) in a standard 4-h51Cr release assay. Since the central four residues are the same between the two peptides, substitutions were made at positions P1, P3, and P8 in the chimeric series. Substitutions at the anchor positions (36Rammensee H.G. Friede T. Stevanoviic S. Immunogenetics. 1995; 41: 178-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar) were avoided to minimize large differences in peptide binding affinity to A2. Considering only P1, P3, and P8 substitutions (Fig. 1 A and Table I), the greatest changes in recognition observed for p1049-based variants are found at the secondary anchor P3 (Trp to Pro) that caused a nearly 10-fold drop in CTL activity (p1049-W3P). This result is perhaps not surprising, considering the differences the proline linkage could be expected to make to the peptide main chain.

Here, atomic force microscopy is used to determine the population distributions for one such nucleosomal array, the 172-12, reconstituted to various subsaturated levels with nonacetylated or hyperacetylated HeLa histones. This array is a model for short linker length genomes and transcriptionally active and newly replicated chromatins. The analysis shows that as input histone levels increase, template occupation increases progressively as discrete population distributions. The distributions are random at low (n av < 4) and high (n av > 8) loadings but display specific nonrandom features, such as a deficit of molecules with one nucleosome more or less than the peak species in the distribution and enhanced distribution breadths, in the mid-range (n av = 4–8). Thus, the mid-range of occupation on polynucleosomal arrays may be a special range for chromatin structure and/or assembly. The mid-range nonrandom features are enhanced in distributions from short repeat (172-12) arrays, particularly for unacetylated chromatin, and in distributions from hyperacetylated chromatin, particularly for long repeat (208-12) arrays. Thus, short repeat length and acetylation can affect basic chromatin properties, like population tendencies, in very similar ways and therefore may cause similar changes in chromatin structure. Some possible effects are suggested. The data also indicate that it is thermodynamically more difficult for hyperacetylated nucleosomes to assemble onto the 172-12 templates, a result having implications for in vivo chromatin assembly.

Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholar, 4Widom J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 285-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), but there are some trends. For example, in transcriptionally activeSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the average nucleosome repeat is ∼170 bp, whereas in the inactive, terminally differentiated chicken erythrocyte, it is 208 bp (3Van Holde K. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). The indication that transcriptionally active chromatin tends to have short nucleosome repeat lengths is strengthened by studies of active genes within metazoan genomes (5Berkowitz E.M. Riggs E.A.

Differences in the lengths of DNA that space the core nucleosomes are likely to have pronounced effects on core nucleosome structure as well as on higher order nucleosome packing arrangements (4Widom J.

The basic 5 S unit can impose a nucleosome positioning preference. Concatamers of these units provide templates that allow the in vitro assembly of defined polynucleosomal arrays suitable for biophysical and biochemical studies. Concatamers of 208-bp 5 S units, e.g. the dodecameric array of units referred to as the 208-12, have been the most widely used, to study nucleosome positioning (9Dong F. Hansen J. van Holde K. Proc.

The 5 S templates were made with a choice of DNA lengths between the basic positioning sequences (8Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar),e.g. 172-12, 190-12, and 208-12, thus creating templates that effectively differ in average nucleosome repeat length. The 172-12 provides a model for short linker length chromatins like yeast, and the 208-12 provides a model for long linker length chromatins such as chicken erythrocyte. To analyze the fundamental features of nucleosome occupation on these multisite 5 S arrays, our labs have recently turned to atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM is a powerful imaging technique that can be used to visualize a number of nucleic acid and nucleoprotein complexes (Refs. 23Lyubchenko Y.L. Jacobs B.L. Lindsay S.M. Stasiak A. Scanning Microsc. 1995; 9: 705-727PubMed Google Scholar and 24Lyubchenko Y.L. Gall A.A. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Methods Mol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15756-15763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It offers particular advantages for the type of investigation described here. The ability to directly visualize individual molecules allows one to count precisely the numbers of nucleosomes present on DNA templates. By analyzing many molecules, it is possible to determine unambiguously the population distribution, in essence the statistical distribution of nucleosome occupation states for the template, as a function of nucleosome loading, in modified versus unmodified chromatin, etc. The experimental results can then be compared with theoretical models for insight on how nucleosomes choose to occupy these arrays. Subsaturated arrays, i.e. arrays in which the number of available 172- or 208-bp nucleosome-binding sites exceeds the number of nucleosomes available to bind, are particularly useful for these types of studies because of the occupancy choices available to nucleosomes loading onto such templates. Subsaturated arrays also have intrinsic interest as models for specific chromosomal regulatory regions like replication origins (31Sogo J.M. Stahl H. Koller T. Knippers R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 32Lohr D. Torchia T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3961-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and gene promoters (33Lohr D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8457-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 34Lohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26795-26798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which are often not fully saturated with nucleosomes. Previously, we determined the population features for subsaturated 208-12 arrays (30Yodh J. Lyubchenko Y. Shlyakhtenko L. Woodbury N. Lohr D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15756-15763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this work, the population distributions for subsaturated 172-12 arrays are determined, and the results are compared with the 208-12 results. The 172-12 is a very important template because it provides a model for organisms with short genomic repeats and for transcriptionally active and newly assembled chromatin, which also tend to have short nucleosome repeat lengths (3Van Holde K. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholar, 5Berkowitz E.M. Riggs E.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7284-7290Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 6Villeponteau B. Brawley J. Martinson H.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, despite its obvious interest as a model for these functionally important chromatins, the 172-12 has not been systematically analyzed except to determine that its folding (13Hansen J. Ausio J. Stanik V. van Holde K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and nucleosome positioning characteristics (9Dong F. Hansen J. van Holde K. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5724-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) resemble those of the 208-12. Thus, our analysis provides novel structural studies that can serve as the basis for further analyses and applications of this important model system. Histone acetylation is a provocative and much studied chromatin feature that is associated with both transcription and replication (35Jeppesen P. Turner B.M. Cell. 1993; 74: 281-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 36Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R.

Because of the link between histone acetylation and these functionally important chromatin states and because yeast histones are known to have high levels of acetylation in vivo (38Davie J. Saunders C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12574-12580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Waterborg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13007-13011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we also analyzed hyperacetylated 172-12 reconstitutes. The plasmid (p5S172-12) containing the 172-12 was a generous gift of J. Hansen. DNA and acetylated or nonacetylated HeLa histones were prepared as described previously (30Yodh J. Lyubchenko Y. Shlyakhtenko L. Woodbury N. Lohr D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15756-15763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nucleosomal arrays were reconstituted at various subsaturating levels following the method of Hansen and Lohr (12Hansen J. Lohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5840-5848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, HeLa histone octamers were mixed with 3 μg of the 172-12 DNA template at varying molar ratios of histone octamers to DNA. DNA and histone octamers were mixed together on ice at a final concentration of 2 m NaCl (plus TE (10 mm Tris-1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0)) and a final volume of 30 μl. Histone octamers were diluted in HSB buffer (2.5 m NaCl, 50 mm phosphate, pH 8.8, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and added last to the reaction mix. Reaction mixtures were dialyzed (Spectra/Por 6–8 kDa) at 4 °C against 1 liter of TE containing 1 m NaCl for >12 h, 0.80 m NaCl for 3 h, and then 0.6 mNaCl overnight. The final dialysis step was against 1 liter of 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) for >12 h. Chromatin was fixed by dialyzing against fresh 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) for 6 h. Excess glutaraldehyde was removed by a final dialysis for 24 h against 1 liter of 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Fixed samples were recovered and stored on ice until further use. To confirm that the reconstitutions were successful and to estimate their concentrations, an aliquot of each reconstitute was electrophoresed at 45 V on a native 3.5% polyacrylamide gel overnight at 4 °C. Oligonucleosomes migrate as a smear between free 172-12 DNA template and the gel well. The more nucleosomes the template contains, the slower it migrates. Those templates carrying ≥8 nucleosomes only minimally enter the gel. The samples for AFM were prepared as described (23Lyubchenko Y.L. Jacobs B.L. Lindsay S.M. Stasiak A. Scanning Microsc. 1995; 9: 705-727PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lyubchenko Y.L. Gall A.A. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 148: 569-578PubMed Google Scholar, 40Lyubchenko Y.L. Gall A.A.

Lindsay S.M. Thiemann O. Simpson L. Shlyakhtenko L.S. Scanning Microsc. 1996; 10 (suppl.): 97-107Google Scholar). Briefly, immediately prior to deposition, chromatin samples were diluted 5–100-fold with 1 mm EDTA (pH 8). Ten microliters of the sample (DNA concentration, 0.2–0.4 μg/ml in 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) was pipetted onto pieces of AP-mica for 2 min, rinsed with deionized water (ModuPure Plus, Continental Water System Corp., San Antonio, TX), and argon-dried under vacuum. From a spread of 2–4 ng of DNA, one can count as many molecules as needed. The AFM images were taken in air with a MultiMode SPM instrument equipped with E-scanner (Digital Instruments, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA) operating in TappingMode. NanoProbe TESP probes (Digital Instruments, Inc.), conical sharp silicon tips (NCH, Nanosensor), and V-shaped silicon cantilevers from K-Tek International, Inc. were used for imaging. The typical tapping frequency was 300–340 kHz for TESP tips and 340–380 kHz for the K-Tek probes; the scanning rate was 2–3 Hz. For each reconstituted sample, 150–400 molecules were analyzed. “Countable” molecules were those that had easily discernible nucleosomes and discernible DNA ends. They could be either extended or more compacted. We also counted molecules containing closely contacting nucleosomes so long as we could be certain, by measuring widths for example, of the number of nucleosomes present. We observe a much higher incidence of closely contacting nucleosomes in the 172-12 samples than were observed previously in the 208-12 samples (30Yodh J. Lyubchenko Y. Shlyakhtenko L. Woodbury N. Lohr D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15756-15763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This feature presumably reflects increased internucleosomal contact resulting from the shorter nucleosomal spacing and will be analyzed thoroughly in another publication. 2R. C. Bash, J. Yodh, N. Woodbury, and D. Lohr, manuscript in preparation. Nucleosome population distributions were obtained by plotting the fraction of molecules with a given number of nucleosomes (n)versus n. Distributions for nonacetylated and hyperacetylated samples ranged from n av < 2 ton av ≅ 11. n av is the average number of nucleosomes present on the templates in a sample distribution. The following equation is used to calculaten av. nav=∑112n×(no.of molecules withnnucleosomes)total no.of molecules countedEq. 1 The error bars for each point in the distribution are calculated according to the following equation. error=no.of molecules with n nucleosomesno.of molecules with n nucleosomes×(Fr)Eq. 2 where Fr is the fraction of molecules with a particular number of nucleosomes, i.e. n. The experimental nucleosome loading distributions from AFM analysis were compared with theoretical distributions calculated, for the same average number of nucleosomes (n av), by assuming that nucleosomes bind randomly and with equal frequencies to each of the twelve 172-bp sites, regardless of the histone octamer to DNA ratio. For the theoretical (random) distributions, the fraction of DNA fragments with n nucleosomes bound (F n) is given by Equation 3. Fn=nav12n1−nav12(12−n)12!(12−n)!n!Eq. 3 Note that n av/12 is the random probability that any particular nucleosome site is occupied. Thus, (n av/12)n(1 −n av/12)(12 −n)is simply the total probability that any given arrangement ofn nucleosomes will exist, and 12!(12 −n)!n ! is the total number of arrangements, assuming that nucleosomes are indistinguishable. 172-12 DNA templates were reconstituted with various subsaturating levels of HeLa histone octamers to obtain a series of subsaturated chromatin samples. Each sample was imaged by AFM. A representative field is shown in Fig. 1. In each field, we counted the number of nucleosomes on every molecule in which all of the nucleosomes were clearly distinguishable, including molecules containing closely contacting dimers or trimers (Fig. 1,arrows), so long as we could be certain of the number of nucleosomes present. For each reconstituted sample, the population distribution, i.e. the plot of the fraction of molecules containing n nucleosomes as a function of n, and the n av, the average number of nucleosomes per template (see “Materials and Methods”), were determined. One of the powerful features inherent in the AFM approach is the ability to determine unambiguously the numbers of nucleosomes on template DNA molecules. Fig. 2 plots the relationship between the input histone level during reconstitution and the average number of nucleosomes (n av) loading onto 172-12 templates. For both acetylated and unacetylated chromatins, the n av increases smoothly with increasing input histone, showing a linear dependence at low n avbut becoming nonlinear at higher values. However, at all input histone levels, higher amounts of hyperacetylated than unacetylated histones are required to achieve a particular n av. Thus, it is apparently more difficult thermodynamically for hyperacetylated nucleosomes to assemble on these templates, at any loading level, indicating that acetylation of the N-terminal tails affects some facet of the occupation process on these templates. A study using a somewhat different experimental material, fully saturated 208-12 arrays (analyzed by restriction digestion), observed no apparent effect of acetylation on saturated loading (20Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A. Hansen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We have not analyzed saturated arrays by AFM methods because nucleosomes are too difficult to count unambiguously on such templates (30Yodh J. Lyubchenko Y. Shlyakhtenko L. Woodbury N. Lohr D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15756-15763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but we do observe that loading curves for subsaturated 208-12 templates remain linear to highern av values than for 172-12 templates, which results in a higher average nucleosome occupancy per input histone at higher subsaturated levels (nav > 9) on the 208-12. 3J. Yodh, Y. Lyubchenko, L. Shlyakhtenko, N. Woodbury, and D. Lohr, unpublished results. We suggest that this difference in loading response reflects a repeat length difference between the two templates. Other repeat length-dependent differences will be described below. Our limited data at very low input histone suggests that the plot may have a nonzero intercept (Fig. 2). One possible explanation for such behavior is a “threshold” effect, i.e. a certain level of histone must be present before nucleosomes begin to appear on the DNA templates. This would probably reflect trivial features, such as the need to saturate binding sites on the dialysis tubing, and in agreement with that suggestion, the curves for both types of 172-12 arrays (Fig. 2) and for 208-12 chromatin (not shown) would extrapolate to the same threshold value. Because AFM only needs subnanogram quantities of material, we routinely reconstitute 3 μg of DNA, and thus, at low n av values, there are only nanogram quantities of histones. Reconstituting larger amounts of material (20Tse C. Sera T. Wolffe A. Hansen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4629-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) could probably avoid this type of behavior. A nonzero intercept would have no consequence for the major feature of Fig. 2, the consistent difference in occupation level between nonacetylated and acetylated arrays, nor for the results to be presented below, which are all based on direct visualization and counting of nucleosomes on DNA templates and thus would be unaffected by such behavior. Moreover, it is possible that the response at low input histone is actually asymptotic, which would make the curves sigmoidal in shape and characteristic of cooperativity. Analysis of nucleosome location data provides a more sensitive way to test for cooperativity and, indeed, using such an analysis, we have detected cooperativity in occupation on 208-12 templates. 4J. Yodh, et al., submitted for publication. 172-12 locational analyses have not been completed.2 Analysis of population distributions provides more detailed information about the nucleosome occupation of these multisite arrays. A representative set of population distributions that span the range from low loading (lown av) to high loading (highn av) for 172-12 templates reconstituted with nonacetylated histones is shown in Fig. 3(A–D, closed circles with solid lines). The error bars shown depend on the number of molecules counted at each value of n and are calculated as described under “Materials and Methods.” For each experimentally determined distribution in Fig. 3, we also show the distribution that would be produced by a random process (dotted lines), calculated for the same n av. A random process assumes random and equivalent binding of nucleosomes to each of the 12 sites on the DNA template, with no binding site preferences or site-site interactions of any kind. The equation used to calculate these theoretical (random) distributions is given under “Materials and Methods.” These representative data demonstrate several characteristic features of subsaturated 172-12 nucleosomal array populations. First, it is clear that reconstitution at any subsaturating level yields a discrete population of (subsaturated) molecules. For example, at least 70% of the molecules are found within a span of ±2 nucleosomes around the peak species in any distribution. With increasing loading, the distributions shift progressively to a highern av value but remain discrete. Thus, polynucleosomal occupation of these templates is multi-state in nature,i.e. it involves stable, partially loaded intermediates and therefore is not highly cooperative. The type of behavior demonstrated in Fig. 3 was previously observed for the larger repeat size 208-12 nucleosomal arrays, whether analyzed by AFM (30Yodh J. Lyubchenko Y. Shlyakhtenko L. Woodbury N. Lohr D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15756-15763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or sedimentation analysis (12Hansen J. Lohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5840-5848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the distributions vary somewhat with the nucleosome occupation level. At low (n av <4) or high (n av >8) loadings, the distributions are featureless and closely resemble random distributions (Fig. 3,A and D). However, in distributions from samples in the mid-range of occupation, n av = 4–8 on these 12-site arrays, there are specific features that indicate deviations from random behavior (Fig. 3, B and C). Perhaps the most obvious of these is a deficit (compared with random expectation) in the fraction of molecules with one nucleosome fewer (Fig. 3 B) or more (Fig. 3 C) than the major peak value in the distribution, a feature that causes secondary maxima, i.e. shoulders, to appear at ±2 nucleosomes from the major peak. This n avdependence is quite repeatable. Virtually all of the distributions at low (<4) and high (>8) n av closely follow a random curve, and none of them shows a +1 or −1 deficit or a secondary maximum, whereas all of the mid-range (n av = 4–8) distributions show these features to some degree, and none follows a random curve (not shown). Moreover, the features appear and then disappear, respectively, in a fairly narrow range aroundn av = 4 and n av = 8. Thus, the ±1 deficit appears to be limited rather specifically to the mid-range of loading. For a more stringent test of the generality of the mid-range features, the data from all of the nonacetylated 172-12 chromatin samples in then av = 4–8 range was pooled (Fig.4 A). To make this compilation, the most populated n value in each sample distribution,i.e. the n value with the largest fraction of molecules in the distribution (designated “0”), and the fractions of molecules containing 1, 2, 3, or 4 nucleosomes fewer (−) or more (+) than that n value are tabulated. The 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, etc. classes from each of the various sample distributions are then summed together and displayed as a single profile (Fig. 4 A). This type of analysis allows all of the various distributions to be combined into a single data set, thus identifying features that are generally characteristic of the entire set of mid-range samples. The composite profile shows a statistically significant depletion of molecules containing one nucleosome fewer and one nucleosome more than the major peak (Fig. 4 A), confirming that this specific deficit at ±1 in the distribution is a general feature of nonacetylated 172-12 arrays in the mid-range of loading. The appearance of shoulders at ±2 nucleosomes from the peak is clearly due to the depletion of the ±1 classes because the shoulders are present at approximately the random expectation level. Thus, the occupation process for these mid-range arrays includes a component(s) that creates a dispreference for molecules containing one nucleosome more or less than the peak value in the distribution. Note that this is not a dispreference for odd numbers of nucleosomes on the template (data not shown). Rather it is a dispreference for molecules that contain one nucleosome more or less than the peak n value, whether that peak value is even or odd. Based on the magnitude of the deviations from random, we estimate that there are ∼20% fewer molecules present in each of the ± 1 classes than a random process would be expected to produce (Fig. 4 A). Thus, the effect responsible for this nonrandom behavior is probably only one contribution to the template loading process. However, the existence of any such tendency is a novel observation and is probably only detectable by an analysis that can determine precise population distributions, like AFM. The distributions for samples in the mid-range of loading are also broader than random expectation. In the composite pro"
