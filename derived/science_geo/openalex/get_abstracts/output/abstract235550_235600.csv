We report the 34 million–base pair draft nuclear genome of the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana and its 129 thousand–base pair plastid and 44 thousand–base pair mitochondrial genomes. Sequence and optical restriction mapping revealed 24 diploid nuclear chromosomes. We identified novel genes for silicic acid transport and formation of silica-based cell walls, high-affinity iron uptake, biosynthetic enzymes for several types of polyunsaturated fatty acids, use of a range of nitrogenous compounds, and a complete urea cycle, all attributes that allow diatoms to prosper in aquatic environments."
https://openalex.org/W2142234529,"By combining three mutually immiscible polymeric components in a mixed-arm star block terpolymer architecture, we have observed the formation of a previously unknown class of multicompartment micelles in dilute aqueous solution. Connection of water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide) and two hydrophobic but immiscible components (a polymeric hydrocarbon and a perfluorinated polyether) at a common junction leads to molecular frustration when dispersed in aqueous solution. The incompatible hydrophobic blocks form cores that are protected from the water by the poly(ethylene oxide) blocks, but both are forced to make contact with the poly(ethylene oxide) by virtue of the chain architecture. The structures that emerge depend on the relative lengths of the blocks and can be tuned from discrete multicompartment micelles to extended wormlike structures with segmented cores."
https://openalex.org/W1968480115,"A stable phase of toroidal, or ringlike, supramolecular assemblies was formed by combining dilute solution characteristics critical for both bundling of like-charged biopolymers and block copolymer micelle formation. The key to toroid versus classic cylinder micelle formation is the interaction of the negatively charged hydrophilic block of an amphiphilic triblock copolymer with a positively charged divalent organic counterion. This produces a self-attraction of cylindrical micelles that leads to toroid formation, a mechanism akin to the toroidal bundling of semiflexible charged biopolymers such as DNA. The toroids can be kinetically trapped or chemically cross-linked. Insight into the mechanism of toroid formation can be gained by observation of intermediate structures kinetically trapped during film casting."
https://openalex.org/W2066545420,"The Golgi enzyme β1,6 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (Mgat5) is up-regulated in carcinomas and promotes the substitution of N-glycan with poly N-acetyllactosamine, the preferred ligand for galectin-3 (Gal-3). Here, we report that expression of Mgat5 sensitized mouse cells to multiple cytokines. Gal-3 cross-linked Mgat5-modified N-glycans on epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor–β receptors at the cell surface and delayed their removal by constitutive endocytosis. Mgat5 expression in mammary carcinoma was rate limiting for cytokine signaling and consequently for epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell motility, and tumor metastasis. Mgat5 also promoted cytokine-mediated leukocyte signaling, phagocytosis, and extravasation in vivo. Thus, conditional regulation of N-glycan processing drives synchronous modification of cytokine receptors, which balances their surface retention against loss via endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2170887794,"Deinococcus radiodurans is extremely resistant to ionizing radiation. How this bacterium can grow under chronic γ radiation [50 grays (Gy) per hour] or recover from acute doses greater than 10 kGy is unknown. We show that D. radiodurans accumulates very high intracellular manganese and low iron levels compared with radiation-sensitive bacteria and that resistance exhibits a concentration-dependent response to manganous chloride [Mn(II)]. Among the most radiation-resistant bacterial groups reported, Deinococcus, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus , and cyanobacteria accumulate Mn(II). In contrast, Shewanella oneidensis and Pseudomonas putida have high iron but low intracellular manganese concentrations and are very sensitive. We propose that Mn(II) accumulation facilitates recovery from radiation injury."
https://openalex.org/W1985753422,"We measured Kondo-assisted tunneling via C60 molecules in contact with ferromagnetic nickel electrodes. Kondo correlations persisted despite the presence of ferromagnetism, but the Kondo peak in the differential conductance was split by an amount that decreased (even to zero) as the moments in the two electrodes were turned from parallel to antiparallel alignment. The splitting is too large to be explained by a local magnetic field. However, the voltage, temperature, and magnetic field dependence of the signals agree with predictions for an exchange splitting of the Kondo resonance. The Kondo effect leads to negative values of magnetoresistance, with magnitudes much larger than the Julliere estimate."
https://openalex.org/W2149902537,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a lipid signaling molecule that regulates many cellular functions, is synthesized from sphingosine and ATP by the action of sphingosine kinase. Two such kinases have been identified, SPHK1 and SPHK2. To begin to investigate the physiological functions of sphingosine kinase and S1P signaling, we generated mice deficient in SPHK1. Sphk1 null mice were viable, fertile, and without any obvious abnormalities. Total SPHK activity in most Sphk1-/-tissues was substantially, but not completely, reduced indicating the presence of multiple sphingosine kinases. S1P levels in most tissues from the Sphk1-/- mice were not markedly decreased. In serum, however, there was a significant decrease in the S1P level. Although S1P signaling regulates lymphocyte trafficking, lymphocyte distribution was unaffected in lymphoid organs of Sphk1-/- mice. The immunosuppressant FTY720 was phosphorylated and elicited lymphopenia in the Sphk1 null mice showing that SPHK1 is not required for the functional activation of this sphingosine analogue prodrug. The results with these Sphk1 null mice reveal that some key physiologic processes that require S1P receptor signaling, such as vascular development and proper lymphocyte distribution, can occur in the absence of SPHK1."
https://openalex.org/W2142987884,"Empirical reconstructions of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperature in the past millennium based on multiproxy records depict small-amplitude variations followed by a clear warming trend in the past two centuries. We use a coupled atmosphere-ocean model simulation of the past 1000 years as a surrogate climate to test the skill of these methods, particularly at multidecadal and centennial time scales. Idealized proxy records are represented by simulated grid-point temperature, degraded with statistical noise. The centennial variability of the NH temperature is underestimated by the regression-based methods applied here, suggesting that past variations may have been at least a factor of 2 larger than indicated by empirical reconstructions."
https://openalex.org/W2094640843,"Two polymer chains that occupy equal volumes when covalently linked together at one end self-assemble into an alternating lamellar morphology that has a characteristic period dictated by the molecular weight. When such copolymers are confined within alumina membranes that have cylindrical pores with diameters comparable to the repeat period, the interaction of the blocks with the confining walls and the imposed curvature induces a morphological transformation to relieve the constraints. Here, we show a lamella-to-toroid transition, captured through the dissolution of the surrounding membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2071229320,"Mitochondrial morphology and physiology are regulated by the processes of fusion and fission. Some forms of apoptosis are reported to be associated with mitochondrial fragmentation. We showed that overexpression of Fzo1A/B (rat) proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion, or silencing of Dnm1 (rat)/Drp1 (human) (a mitochondrial fission protein), increased elongated mitochondria in healthy cells. After apoptotic stimulation, these interventions inhibited mitochondrial fragmentation and cell death, suggesting that a process involved in mitochondrial fusion/fission might play a role in the regulation of apoptosis. Consistently, silencing of Fzo1A/B or Mfn1/2 (a human homolog of Fzo1A/B) led to an increase of shorter mitochondria and enhanced apoptotic death. Overexpression of Fzo1 inhibited cytochrome c release and activation of Bax/Bak, as assessed from conformational changes and oligomerization. Silencing of Mfn or Drp1 caused an increase or decrease of mitochondrial sensitivity to apoptotic stimulation, respectively. These results indicate that some of the proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion/fission modulate apoptotic cell death at the mitochondrial level.

Silencing of Mfn or Drp1 caused an increase or decrease of mitochondrial sensitivity to apoptotic stimulation, respectively. These results indicate that some of the proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion/fission modulate apoptotic cell death at the mitochondrial level. Apoptosis plays an important role in various biological events in metazoans, including development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. A family of cysteine proteases called caspases cleaves various cellular proteins and thus drives the process of apoptosis. It has been shown that the mitochondria play a pivotal role in apoptosis by releasing several apoptogenic molecules (such as cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO, Omi/HtrA2, AIF, and endonuclease G) into the cytoplasm from the intermembrane space, after which these molecules activate downstream destruction programs, including the caspase cascade (1Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic increase of mitochondrial membrane permeability is mainly regulated by members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins (2Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 3Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Bcl-2 family consists of anti-apoptotic members such as Bcl-2 as well as pro-apoptotic members, including multidomain members such as Bax and Bak and numerous BH3-only proteins (e.g. Bid). BH3-only proteins, when activated, transmit apoptotic signals to the mitochondria to activate Bax and Bak (which act as a gateway), leading to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (5Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 6Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). The apoptotic mitochondrial membrane permeabilization may also be influenced by the mitochondrial physiological status, including respiration, lipid context, and fusion/fission (7Malisan F. Testi R. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 1573-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are continuously fusing and dividing, processes that are thought to have a role in homeostasis. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, fission of the outer mitochondrial membrane is driven by Dnm1p, Fis1p, and Mdv1p (8Bleazard W. McCaffery J.M. King E.J. Bale S. Mozdy A. Tieu Q. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar, 9Mozdy A.D. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 10Tieu Q. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), whereas Mdm33p is involved in fission of the inner mitochondrial membrane (11Messerschmitt M. Jakobs S. Vogel F. Fritz S. Dimmer K.S. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Dnm1p is a dynamin-related GTPase that is normally localized in the cytosol (8Bleazard W. McCaffery J.M. King E.J. Bale S. Mozdy A. Tieu Q. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar); it undergoes translocation and binds to the outer membrane via Fis1p during fission (9Mozdy A.D. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and is thought to form a large oligomeric ring-like complex that pinches the outer mitochondrial membrane. Deletion of any of the fission genes blocks mitochondrial fission and produces a fused, interconnected mitochondrial network. Orthologs of Dnm1p have been characterized in Caenorhabditis elegans (DRP1) (12Labrousse A.M. Zappaterra M.D. Rube D.A. van der Bliek A.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 815-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) as well as in mammals (Drp1) (13Smirnova E. Shurland D.L. Ryazantsev S.N. van der Bliek A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Fzo1p and Ugo1p drive fusion of the outer mitochondrial membrane (14Rapaport D. Brunner M. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20150-20155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 15Hermann G.J. Thatcher J.W. Mills J.P. Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), whereas Mgm1p is involved in fusion of the inner mitochondrial membrane (17Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) in S. cerevisiae. Fzo1 was first characterized in Drosophila melanogaster and is a large GTPase that circumscribes the outer membrane and is essential for mitochondrial fusion (18Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Mutations of the fzo gene in flies inhibit mitochondrial fusion during spermatogenesis, leading to a “fuzzy onion” morphology (18Hales K.G. Fuller M.T. Cell. 1997; 90: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). A homolog of Fzo1 protein is found in mammals (e.g. rat Fzo1 and human Mfn) (19Ishihara N. Jofuku A. Eura Y. Mihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 20Santel A. Fuller M.T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 867-874Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Defects of yeast fzo1 or the mammalian homologs of Fzo1 result in extensive fragmentation of the mitochondria and lead to cells being classed as the ρ0 phenotype, which lacks mitochondrial DNA (14Rapaport D. Brunner M. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20150-20155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that the processes of mitochondrial fusion/fission are somehow involved in the regulation of apoptosis. During the early stage of apoptosis, the mitochondrial network is destroyed in mammalian cells (21Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar, 22Karbowski M. Youle R.J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that overexpression of a dominant-negative Drp1 mutant (Drp1K38A) prevents apoptotic fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, as well as the occurrence of cytochrome c release, and apoptosis (21Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). Furthermore, silencing of Opa1 (a human homolog of Mgm1p) and overexpression of Fis1 both induce mitochondrial fragmentation, and reportedly also induce apoptosis (24Olichon A. Baricault L. Gas N. Guillou E. Valette A. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7743-7746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 25James D.I. Parone P.A. Mattenberger Y. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36373-36379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which fusion and fission processes are involved in apoptosis remain to be elucidated. In the present study, we confirmed that mitochondrial fragmentation occurred during apoptosis in some cell lines. We also found that increasing or decreasing the expression of proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion (Fzo1/Mfn) relative to proteins involved in fission (Dnm1/Drp1) resulted in cells becoming more resistant or more sensitive to apoptotic stimulation, respectively, by influencing the activation of Bax/Bak in the mitochondria. Chemicals and Antibodies—Bismaleimidohexane was obtained from Pierce. The caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk 1The abbreviations used are: z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; siRNA, small interference RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. was purchased from Peptide Inc. (Minoh, Japan). An anti-Bax polyclonal antibody (N-20) and anti-Bak monoclonal antibody (Ab-1) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Oncogene (Boston, MA), respectively. Anti-Drp1 and anti-Tom20 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratory (San Diego, CA). Anti-human Fas monoclonal antibody (CH-11), anti-cytochrome c (6H2 and 7H8) monoclonal antibodies, and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody were obtained from MBL (Nagoya, Japan), BD Pharmingen, and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), respectively. Anti-GAPDH antibody and anti-porin (voltage-dependent anion channel) monoclonal antibody were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA) and Calbiochem, respectively. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—HeLa cells (a human cervical carcinoma cell line) and a derivative cell line with stable overexpression of human Bcl-2 (26Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2251-2257PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Rat1 cells (a rat fibroblast cell line) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. SV40 T antigen-transformed wild type (WT) and Bax/Bak double knockout MEFs were grown in modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. To visualize mitochondria in living cells, DNA encoding Su9-DsRed2 was used: this fusion construct was produced by insertion of the presequence of mouse F1F0 ATPase subunit 9 into the DsRed2-N1 vector plasmid. DNA encoding truncated human Bid inserted into the pUCCAGGS expression vector (27Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar) and DNAs encoding rat Fzo1A/B inserted into the pCMV14 expression vector (Sigma) were also used. Cells (1 × 106) were transfected with plasmid DNA using the Amaxa electroporation system according to the supplier's protocol (kit V, program U-20). The efficiency of transfection was more than 75% as assessed by cotransfection of Su9-DsRed2 DNA. All the siRNAs used were produced by Dharmacon Research, and the sequences were as follows (numbers in parentheses indicate nucleotide positions within the respective open reading frame): rat Fzo1A-siRNA (46–66), 5′-AAGGACAAGCGACACAUGGCU-3′; rat Fzo1B-siRNA (110–130), 5′-AAGCAACAUACAGGAACCCGG-3′; rat Dnm1-siRNA (96–116), 5′-AACUCAGAGCAGUGGAAAGAG-3′; human Mfn1-siRNA (46–66), 5′-AAGGGGAUUACUGCAAUCUUU-3′; human Mfn2-siRNA (52–72) 5′-AAGAGACACAUGGCUGAGGUG-3′; human Drp1-siRNA (96–116) 5′-AACGCAGAGCAGCGGAAAGAG-3′; and GFP-siRNA (274–294), and 5′-GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCACC-3′. Cells (Rat1 or HeLa cells) were transfected twice on alternate days with 10 μg of siRNA using the Amaxa electroporation system. Analysis of Mitochondrial Morphology and Immunocytochemistry— HeLa cells, Rat1 cells, and MEFs were transiently transfected with Su9-DsRed2, and mitochondrial morphology was analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss; LSM510META). To determine the localization of Drp1, HeLa cells were grown in 8-well chamber slides and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Next, the cells were incubated with anti-Drp1 monoclonal antibody for1hat room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were stained with goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody, washed twice with PBS, and examined under a confocal microscope. Subcellular Fractionation—To assess Bax translocation and cytochrome c release, subcellular fractionation was performed using digitonin, as described previously (28Nomura M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Narita M. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5542-5548PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing twice with PBS, cells were suspended in buffer (20 mm potassium HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 0.1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and treated with 30 μg/ml digitonin for 5 min at 37 °C. Centrifugation was used to separate the cytosolic and organellar fractions, followed by lysis with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Isolation of the heavy membrane fraction enriched in mitochondria for measurement of Drp1 was done as described previously (29Breckenridge D.G. Stojanovic M. Marcellus R.C. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1115-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Finally, aliquots of each fraction were subjected to Western blot analysis. Analysis of Protein Oligomerization—Oligomerization of Bak was investigated by gel filtration chromatography. HeLa cells were harvested, washed twice with PBS, and lysed with HNC buffer (25 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After sonication and centrifugation (15,000 rpm for 15 min), the cell extract was collected and loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in HNC buffer without dithiothreitol. Fractions of 96 μl were collected, and aliquots of each fraction were subjected to Western blotting. To detect oligomerization of Bax, HeLa cells were treated with etoposide, harvested, and washed twice with PBS. Then the cells were resuspended in PBS, and Me2SO (control) or bismaleimidohexane was added at a final concentration of 0.1 mm. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the cells were collected and resuspended in protein sample buffer containing dithiothreitol to quench the cross-linking reaction. Analysis of Cell Death—HeLa cells and Rat1 cells were treated with 200 μm etoposide or 1 μg/ml anti-human Fas antibody (CH-11). Apoptotic cells were detected by examination of nuclear morphology after staining with Hoechst 33342 (1 μm). Permeabilized Cells—HeLa cells grown in 10-well poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides, washed twice with isotonic buffer (20 mm potassium HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 250 mm sucrose), permeabilized with 20 μg/ml digitonin for about 4 min at room temperature, and then washed with isotonic buffer. Permeabilized cells were incubated with recombinant human Bid protein for 10 min at 37 °C, washed with isotonic buffer, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Then the fixed cells were stained with anti-Bak (Ab-1) or anti-cytochrome c antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Apoptotic Mitochondrial Fragmentation and Translocation of Drp1 Are Bcl-2-independent Processes—Recent studies have shown that fragmentation of the mitochondrial network occurs during an early stage of apoptosis (21Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar, 29Breckenridge D.G. Stojanovic M. Marcellus R.C. Shore G.C. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). To confirm this, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with DNA encoding mitochondria-targeting DsRed2 and then treated with etoposide (an inhibitor of topoisomerase II). By transfection of cells with this plasmid, the mitochondria were specifically stained red irrespective of their membrane potential (data not shown). Whereas many mitochondria were elongated and created a network in healthy cells, the mitochondria became fragmented after addition of etoposide (Fig. 1, A and B), confirming previous observations (21Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). This change occurred at an early stage of apoptosis and was not affected by the caspase(s) inhibitor z-VAD-fmk or by Bcl-2 overexpression (Fig. 1, A and B), both of which almost completely inhibited apoptosis (Fig. 1B), suggesting that apoptotic mitochondrial fragmentation is a Bcl-2-insensitive and caspase-independent process. Apoptotic mitochondrial fragmentation was also observed when cells were subjected to other stimuli, such as anti-Fas and staurosporine, and also when other cell lines (COS7 and Rat1) were tested (data not shown). However, mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) showed very limited mitochondrial fragmentation during etoposide-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1C). To examine whether the mitochondrial fission machinery was involved in apoptotic mitochondrial fragmentation, we examined the localization of a mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, which has been reported to accumulate in the mitochondria during fission as well as apoptosis in some cell lines (21Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar, 30Karbowski M.

Subcellular fractionation analysis revealed that etoposide induced translocation of a significant amount (approximately one-fifth) of Drp1 to the mitochondria (Fig. 1D). This was also confirmed by immunofluorescence study: after the cells were treated with etoposide, colocalization of Drp1 with Su9-DsRed2 increased as judged by significant increase of yellow color in the merged photos (Fig. 1E). Although etoposide-treated MEFs showed little apoptotic mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 1C), there was significant translocation of Drp1 to the mitochondria as in HeLa cells (Fig. 1F). These results suggested that mitochondrial fragmentation varies between cell lines while a similar extent of Drp1 translocation to the mitochondria occurs during apoptosis, suggesting possible involvement of Drp1 and the mitochondrial fission apparatus in apoptotic events. Using this method, we also examined whether or not Bcl-2 had an influence on apoptotic translocation of Drp1. As shown in Fig. 1D, etoposide induced translocation of Drp1 that was not inhibited by Bcl-2, consistent with the lack of inhibition of apoptotic mitochondrial fragmentation (Fig. 1A), indicating that apoptotic translocation of Drp1 to the mitochondria occurs in a Bcl-2-independent manner. Fzo1 Inhibits Etoposide-induced Apoptotic Mitochondrial Fragmentation and Various Types of Apoptosis—We next examined whether apoptosis was influenced by the inhibition of mitochondrial fission. Rat Fzo1 (corresponding to human Mfn), an essential protein for mitochondrial fusion, was introduced into HeLa cells. Because rats have two Fzo1 genes (Fzo1A and Fzo1B) that show 60% amino acid identity and are both essential for mitochondrial fusion (19Ishihara N. Jofuku A. Eura Y. Mihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we introduced these two genes into HeLa cells concomitantly. Overexpression of Fzo1A/B increased elongated mitochondria (Fig. 2A). Not only etoposide-induced mitochondrial fragmentation, but also etoposide-induced apoptosis, was markedly delayed by Fzo1 overexpression (Fig. 2, A and B). Similar results were obtained when HeLa cells were treated with anti-Fas antibody (Fig. 2C), when Rat1 cells were treated with etoposide (Fig. 2D), and when MEFs were treated with etoposide (Fig. 2E). These results indicated that Fzo1A/B delays various types of apoptosis, possibly by inhibiting apoptotic mitochondrial fission. Silencing of Fzo1 and Dnm1 (Proteins Involved in Mitochondrial Fusion and Fission) Alters Sensitivity of Cells to Apoptotic Stimuli—To determine whether alterations in the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial fusion/fission could influence the sensitivity of cells to apoptosis, we tested the effect of silencing rat Fzo1A/B and Dnm1 (a protein involved in fission) in Rat1 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, Fzo1 and Dnm1 were almost completely eliminated by 48 h after the introduction of siRNA. After silencing of Fzo1, the filamentous mitochondrial network disappeared (Fig. 3B, middle panel), whereas silencing of Dnm1 resulted in the formation of elongated and interconnected mitochondria (Fig. 3B, right panel). When the cells were subsequently treated with etoposide, Fzo1-silenced cells were more sensitive to apoptosis than control cells, whereas Dnm1-silenced cells were more resistant to apoptosis (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained when HeLa cells were subjected to silencing of Mfn1/2 (the human homologs of Fzo1B/A, respectively) or Drp1 (the human homolog of Dnm1) (Fig. 3, D and E). Although cells with silencing of Fzo1A/B or Mfn1/2 showed fragmented mitochondria, death did not occur without apoptotic stimulation (Fig. 3, C and E). All these results indicated that modulation of genes involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission could significantly influence the sensitivity of cells to apoptosis. Fzo1 Inhibits Etoposide-induced Apoptosis by Delaying Cytochrome c Release and Bax/Bak Activation—How does Fzo1 inhibit apoptosis? Bax and Bak, which act as a gateway for various apoptotic signals at the mitochondria, are thought to exist as inactive forms in healthy cells, and various apoptotic stimuli may cause their activation through conformation changes and oligomerization, leading to cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (5Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 6Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first examined the effect of Fzo1 on apoptotic cytochrome c release in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), Fzo1 delayed etoposide-induced and Fas-mediated release of cytochrome c, indicating that Fzo1 acted upstream of cytochrome c release. Next, we examined the effect of Fzo1 on etoposide-induced activation of Bax/Bak and found that oligomerization of both Bax and Bak was markedly delayed by Fzo1 expression (Fig. 4, C and D). Bax (but not Bak) is mainly localized in the cytoplasm of healthy cells and shows translocation to the mitochondria after apoptotic stimulation. Interestingly, overexpression of Fzo1 inhibited apoptotic mitochondrial localization of Bax (Fig. 4E), which might have led to a delay in Bax activation. Taken together, these findings indicate that Fzo1 expression delayed the activation of Bax/Bak and thereby inhibited both cytochrome c release and apoptosis. The Balance between Fusion and Fission Proteins Affects Mitochondrial Sensitivity to Death Stimuli—Changes in the levels of proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion/fission had an effect on apoptosis. Overexpression of Fzo1 inhibited apoptotic mitochondrial fragmentation and delayed Bax/Bak activation and cytochrome c release during apoptosis, raising the possibility that changes of the proteins involved in mitochondrial fusion/fission could alter mitochondrial sensitivity to apoptotic stimulation. To examine this issue, HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA for Mfn1/2 or Drp1, permeabilized with digitonin, and then incubated with recombinant Bid, which is a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family and activates Bax/Bak (5Tsujimoto Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 6Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). Using this method, mitochondria in different states could be subjected to the same apoptotic stimulus, and the response was assessed by measuring cytochrome c release and Bak activation using a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody that only reacted activated Bak. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that recombinant Bid caused the activation of Bak in control cells but not in Bcl-2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Because activation of Bak is cancelled by Bcl-2 in several cell lines, our in vitro system corresponded well with the cellular response. As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), Mfn1/2-silenced cells largely had fragmented mitochondria and showed enhanced activation of Bak, whereas Drp1-silenced cells had elongated mitochondria and showed resistance to Bak activation. Consistent with these findings, Bid-induced cytochrome c release was accelerated by the silencing of Mfn1/2, whereas it was inhibited by silencing of Drp1 (Fig. 5, C and D). All these results suggested that the balance between mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins could affect mitochondrial sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli.Fig. 5Mitochondrial fusion/fission balance affects mitochondrial sensitivity to recombinant Bid. HeLa cells were transfected twice on alternate days with the indicated siRNAs together with Su9-DsRed2 DNA. At 48 h after the second transfection, cells were permeabilized with digitonin and then incubated with recombinant human Bid (1 μg) for 10 min at 37 °C. Next, the cells were fixed and immunostained using a conformation-specific Bak monoclonal antibody (Ab-1) that only bound to activated Bak (A and B), or an anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (C and D). Bcl-2-overexpressing HeLa cells were used as a control. Note that cells with cytochrome c release did not show a cytochrome c signal (arrows) due to leakage through the permeabilized plasma membrane. A and C, representative images are shown. B and D, Ab1-positive cells (B) and cells with cytochrome c release (D) were counted in three randomly chosen fields under a confocal microscope. Data are shown as the mean ± S.D. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Here we showed that 1) mitochondrial fragmentation occurred during apoptosis and was accompanied by mitochondrial translocation of Drp1, whereas 2) changes in levels of mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins (Fzo1 (Mfn) and Dnm1 (Drp1)) affected the sensitivity of the mitochondria and cells to apoptotic stimulation. A higher fusion/fission protein ratio increased the resistance of mitochondria and cells to apoptotic stimulation, whereas a lower ratio had the opposite effect. Because mitochondrial fragmentation was not observed in some cell lines, this process does not seem to be a prerequisite for apoptosis but rather to contribute to increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. How does the mitochondrial fusion/fission protein balance affect apoptosis? Although detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated, one possibility is that, because fission and fusion of phospholipid membranes are regulated by these proteins, the mitochondrial lipid composition changes when the balance between fusion and fission protein is altered. Accumulating evidence indicates that changes of the phospholipid composition of the mitochondrial membrane can influence apoptosis. It has been reported that cardiolipin, which is a unique phospholipid in the mitochondria, is essential for the functioning of tBid during apoptosis (31Lutter M. Fang M. Luo X. Nishijima M. Xie X. Wang X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and for Bax-mediated permeabilization of liposomes (32Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar), and that the intramitochondrial distribution of cardiolipin alters during apoptosis (33Garcia Fernandez M. Troiano L. Moretti L. Nasi M. Pinti M. Salvioli S. Dobrucki J. Cossarizza A. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 449-455PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiolipin is localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane and accumulates at intermembrane contact sites (34Schlame M. Rua D. Greenberg M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), which have been suggested as a target for tBid and Bax (35Lutter M. Perkins G.A. Wang X. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 36Zamzami N. Brenner C. Marzo I. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2265-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Changes in the levels of mitochondrial fusion/fission proteins might alter the cardiolipin content of the mitochondrial membrane, thus affecting the sensitivity of the mitochondria and cells to apoptotic stimulation. We also showed that Mfn/Fzo1-silenced cells, in which the mitochondria underwent fragmentation, did not die in the absence of additional apoptotic stimuli. These results were inconsistent with previous reports suggesting that silencing of Opa1 or overexpression of Fis1 caused both mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis (24Olichon A. Baricault L. Gas N. Guillou E. Valette A. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7743-7746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 25James D.I. Parone P.A. Mattenberger Y. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36373-36379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), so it is possible that Fis1 expression or Opa1 silencing not only provides a fission signal but also an apoptotic signal. We also confirmed the previous observations (21Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar, 29Breckenridge D.G. Stojanovic M. Marcellus R.C. Shore G.C. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar) that Drp1 translocates from the cytosol to the mitochondria during apoptosis, although the mechanism regulating Drp1 translocation is unknown. It has been reported that a dominant negative mutant of Drp1 suppresses some forms of apoptosis (21Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar), suggesting that the translocation of Drp1 to the mitochondria might be important for apoptosis by triggering mitochondrial fragmentation. We found that overexpression of Fzo1 significantly delayed the mitochondrial translocation of Drp1 (data not shown). In this study, Bcl-2 did not inhibit either apoptotic mitochondrial fragmentation or translocation of Drp1 to the mitochondria (Fig. 1). We also found that apoptosis-induced translocation of Drp1 occurs equally in the absence of Bax and Bak (data not shown). Consistently, apoptotic mitochondrial fragmentation and Drp1 translocation were not observed when apoptosis was induced by overexpression of truncated Bid (tBid) (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that the Bcl-2 family of proteins does not seem to be involved in the processes of apoptotic mitochondrial fragmentation and Drp1 translocation, suggesting that various apoptotic stimuli (including etoposide, anti-Fas, etc.) not only activate Bax/Bak but also promote mitochondrial fragmentation that sensitizes the mitochondria to apoptotic signals. Finally, it is interesting to note that several diseases are associated with mutations of genes involved in mitochondrial fusion/fission. Mutations of the opa1 gene have been reported in autosomal dominant optic atrophy patients with degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells (37Kjer P. Jensen O.A. Klinken L. Acta Ophthalmol. (Copenh.). 1983; 61: 300-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been described that a mutation of the mfn2 gene causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy type 2A (38Zuchner S. Mersiyanova I.V. Muglia M. Bissar-Tadmouri N. Rochelle J. Dadali E.L. Zappia M. Nelis E. Patitucci A. Senderek J. Parman Y. Evgrafov O. Jonghe P.D. Takahashi Y. Tsuji S. Pericak-Vance M.A. Quattrone A. Battologlu E. Polyakov A.V. Timmerman V. Schroder J.M. Vance J.M. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). It is possible that defects of mitochondrial fusion/fission might alter the susceptibility of cells to apoptotic death and, thus, cause these diseases. We are grateful to Drs. N. Ishihara and K. Mihara (Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyushu University) for providing rat Fzo1A/B cDNAs and for helpful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2135154675,"Over the past 50 million years, successive clades of large carnivorous mammals diversified and then declined to extinction. In most instances, the cause of the decline remains a puzzle. Here we argue that energetic constraints and pervasive selection for larger size (Cope's rule) in carnivores lead to dietary specialization (hypercarnivory) and increased vulnerability to extinction. In two major clades of extinct North American canids, the evolution of large size was associated with a dietary shift to hypercarnivory and a decline in species durations. Thus, selection for attributes that promoted individual success resulted in progressive evolutionary failure of their clades."

Structures of archaeal rhodopsins, which function as light-driven ion pumps or photosensors, have been reported. We present the structure of a eubacterial rhodopsin, which differs from those of previously characterized archaeal rhodopsins in its chromophore and cytoplasmic-side portions. Anabaena sensory rhodopsin exhibits light-induced interconversion between stable 13-cis and all-trans states of the retinylidene protein. The ratio of its cis and trans chromophore forms depends on the wavelength of illumination, thus providing a mechanism for a single protein to signal the color of light, for example, to regulate color-sensitive processes such as chromatic adaptation in photosynthesis. Its cytoplasmic half channel, highly hydrophobic in the archaeal rhodopsins, contains numerous hydrophilic residues networked by water molecules, providing a connection from the photoactive site to the cytoplasmic surface believed to interact with the receptor's soluble 14-kilodalton transducer."

One class of inhibitors, termed ubistatins, blocked cell cycle progression by inhibiting cyclin B proteolysis and inhibited degradation of ubiquitinated Sic1 by purified proteasomes. Ubistatins blocked the binding of ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome by targeting the ubiquitin-ubiquitin interface of Lys 48 -linked chains. The same interface is recognized by ubiquitin-chain receptors of the proteasome, indicating that ubistatins act by disrupting a critical protein-protein interaction in the ubiquitin-proteasome system."

Although the aggregates of Aβ peptides are rich in intermolecular β-sheet, the precise secondary structure of Aβ in the aggregates remains unclear. To identify the amino acid residues involved in the β-sheet formation, 34 proline-substituted mutants of Aβ42 were synthesized and their aggregative ability and neurotoxicity on PC12 cells were examined. Prolines are rarely present in β-sheet, whereas they are easily accommodated in β-turn as a Pro-X corner. Among the mutants at positions 15-32, only E22P-Aβ42 extensively aggregated with stronger neurotoxicity than wild-type Aβ42, suggesting that the residues at positions 15-21 and 24-32 are involved in the β-sheet and that the turn at positions 22 and 23 plays a crucial role in the aggregation and neurotoxicity of Aβ42. The C-terminal proline mutants (A42P-, I41P-, and V40P-Aβ42) hardly aggregated with extremely weak cytotoxicity, whereas the C-terminal threonine mutants (A42T- and I41T-Aβ42) aggregated potently with significant cytotoxicity. These results indicate that the hydrophobicity of the C-terminal two residues of Aβ42 is not related to its aggregative ability and neurotoxicity, rather the C-terminal three residues adopt the β-sheet. These results demonstrate well the large difference in aggregative ability and neurotoxicity between Aβ42 and Aβ40. In contrast, the proline mutants at the N-terminal 13 residues showed potent aggregative ability and neurotoxicity similar to those of wild-type Aβ42.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). This deposition mainly consists of 40- and 42-mer peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) generated from amyloid precursor protein by two proteases, β- and γ-secretase (2Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H.

Neurol. 1995; 37: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Aβ42 plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of AD, because the aggregative ability and neurotoxicity of Aβ42 are considerably higher than those of Aβ40 (4Davis J. van Nostrand W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2996-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Because the aggregative ability of Aβ peptides is closely related to the neurotoxicity, precise structural information for amyloid fibrils is indispensable for understanding the molecular mechanisms of AD and related folding diseases and for developing new medicinal leads using the inhibitory activity of amyloid fibril formation. Previous studies on Aβ fibrils showed that Aβ aggregates mainly consist of intermolecular parallel β-sheet (5Antzutkin O.N. Balbach J.J. Leapman R.D. Rizzo N.W. Reed J. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

However, the technical barriers to using x-ray crystallography or solution NMR have hampered its structural determination in high resolution (10Serpell L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is a fairly reliable approach to elucidating the structure of amyloid fibrils. In fact, solid-state NMR analysis on the Aβ40 aggregates has been reported recently (7Petkova A.T. Ishii Y. Balbach J.J. Antzutkin O.N. Leapman R.D. Delaglio F. Tycko R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16742-16747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 9Tycko R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3151-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). However, there are few reports on the structure of Aβ42 aggregates that are more important in AD, possibly because efficient synthesis of Aβ42 with 14 hydrophobic and bulky amino acid residues at the C terminus is quite difficult (11Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The weak point of solid-state NMR is that it requires a series of 13C- and/or 15N-labeled Aβ peptides at different positions in large quantity (20-30 mg). Systematic replacement with proline in peptides is a reliable and rapid method for predicting the secondary structure, especially β-sheet and turn (12Wood S.J. Wetzel R. Martin J.D. Hurle M.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Prolines are rarely present in β-sheet, whereas they are easily accommodated in a variety of turns, for example, as a Pro-X corner (where X is a variable amino acid residue) (13Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 115: 135-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Quite recently, Williams et al. (14Williams A.D. Portelius E. Kheterpal I. Guo J. Cook K.D. Xu Y. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) have investigated a systematic proline replacement of Aβ40, showing that the residues 15-21, 24-28, and 31-36 are likely to include the β-sheet portions of the fibril and that the residues at positions 22, 23, 29, and 30 probably occupy turn positions among these β-sheet elements. This conclusion does not contradict our preliminary investigation using proline-substituted Aβ42 at positions 19-26 (15Morimoto A. Irie K. Murakami K. Ohigashi H. Shindo M. Nagao M. Shimizu T. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, such systematic proline replacement should be carried out with Aβ42, the aggregative ability and neurotoxicity of which are especially high (4Davis J. van Nostrand W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2996-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our continuous efforts to synthesize a series of Aβ42 derivatives with proline replacement (Fig. 1) led to the proposal of a new structural model of Aβ42 aggregates. This is a full report on the aggregative ability and neurotoxicity of a series of proline-substituted Aβ42 mutants.

N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), trifluoroacetic acid, 1,2-ethanedithiol, thioanisole, m-cresol, and diethyl ether (peroxide-free) were purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) reagents were purchased from Sigma. Synthesis of Aβ Derivatives—Each Aβ derivative was synthesized in a stepwise fashion on 0.1 mmol of preloaded Fmoc-Val-PEG-PS (for Aβ40 derivatives) or Fmoc-Ala-PEG-PS (for Aβ42 derivatives) resin by Pioneer™ using the Fmoc method as reported previously (15Morimoto A.

The coupling reaction was carried out using Fmoc amino acid (0.4 mmol), HATU (0.4 mmol), and DIPEA (0.8 mmol) in DMF for 30 min. After each coupling reaction, the N-terminal Fmoc group was deblocked with 20% piperidine in DMF. After completion of the chain elongation, each peptide resin washed with DMF and CH2Cl2 was treated with a mixture containing trifluoroacetic acid, m-cresol, ethanedithiol, and thioanisole for final deprotection and cleavage from the resin. After 2 h of shaking at room temperature, the crude peptide precipitated by diethyl ether was purified by HPLC under alkaline conditions as reported previously (15Morimoto A. Irie K. Murakami K.

Lyophilization gave a corresponding pure Aβ peptide, the purity of which was confirmed by HPLC (>98%). Each purified peptide exhibited satisfactory mass spectrometric data. The difference between the calculated and theoretical molecular mass was less than one mass unit. Sedimentation Assay for Fibril Formation—Each Aβ derivative was dissolved in 0.02% NH4OH at 250 μm. After a 10-fold dilution by 50 mm sodium phosphate containing 100 mm NaCl at pH 7.4, the resultant peptide solution (25 μm) was incubated at 37 °C for 4, 8, 16, 24, or 48 h. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min, 25 μl of the supernatant was then analyzed by HPLC as reported previously (15Morimoto A. Irie K. Murakami K.

The area of the absorption at 220 nm was integrated and expressed as a percentage of the control. Molar concentration of soluble Aβ peptides present at equilibrium (Cr) was determined by Micro-BCA protein assay (Pierce). Th-T Fluorescence Assay—Each Aβ derivative was dissolved in 0.02% NH4OH at 250 μm. The peptide solution (25 μm) diluted with the phosphate buffer solution described above (pH 7.4) was incubated at 37 °C for 4, 8, 16, 24, 48, or 72 h. Three microliters of each Aβ solution was added to 300 μl of 5 μm Th-T in 50 mm Gly-NaOH (pH 8.5). Fluorescence intensity was measured at 450-nm excitation and 482-nm emission as reported previously (23Naiki H. Gejyo F. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Cell Culture of PC12 Cells—Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were obtained from Riken Cell Bank and were cultured as reported previously (15Morimoto A. Irie K. Murakami K. Ohigashi H. Shindo M.

For experimental purposes, near-confluent cultures of the cells were plated at ∼104 cells/100 μl/well fresh culture medium in a 96-well tissue culture plate coated with collagen and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 overnight before the experiments. MTT Assay Using PC12 Cells—The reduction of MTT by mitochondrial reductase was carried out by protocols based on a previous report (24Shearman M.S. Ragan C.I. Iversen L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1470-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Each solution of Aβ derivatives (0.1% NH4OH) sterilized by a filter (0.22 μm) was diluted with 0.1% NH4OH at concentrations ranging from 0.12 to 120 μm. 10 μl of the resultant solution and 10 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl were, respectively, added to the above-mentioned 100-μl cell culture, which was incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 48 h. After removal of 30 μl of the medium, 10 μl of 5 mg/ml MTT in the phosphate buffer solution described above was added to the cell culture, which was incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 4 h. After evacuation of the culture medium, the cell lysis buffer (100 μl/well; 10% SDS, 0.01 m NH4Cl) was subsequently added to the cells and the cell lysate was incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature. The colorimetric determination of MTT was made at 600 nm. The absorbance obtained by the addition of vehicle was taken as 100%. Transmission Electron Micrographs of Negatively Stained Preparations of the Fibrils Formed by Aβ42 Derivatives—The fibril formation of the Aβ42 derivatives was detected by electron microscope. Each Aβ42 derivative (25 μm) was incubated in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl for 48 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed from the pellets. Aggregates were then suspended in water by gentle vortex mixing. These suspensions were applied to a 400-mesh collodion-coated copper grid (Nissin EM, Tokyo, Japan) and allowed to dry in air before being negatively stained for 2 min with 2% uranyl acetate. Fibrils were examined with the Hitachi H-7500 electron microscope. Synthesis of Proline-substituted Aβ42 Mutants—It is difficult to synthesize Aβ42 with 14 hydrophobic and/or bulky amino acid residues at the C terminus in a highly pure form, because it easily aggregates even under weakly acidic and neutral conditions (11Burdick D. Soreghan B. Kwon M. Kosmoski J. Knauer M. Henschen A. Yates J. Cotman C. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 546-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently established a highly efficient method for synthesizing long peptides of over 50 amino acid residues with a continuous flow-type peptide synthesizer (Pioneer™) using HATU (18Carpino L.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4397-4398Crossref Scopus (1386) Google Scholar) as an effective coupling reagent for Fmoc chemistry. After final deprotection and cleavage from the resin followed by purification using HPLC in the alkaline condition (CH3CN-0.1% NH4OH), each Aβ derivative was successfully taken in a highly pure form as reported previously (15Morimoto A.

The total yields of the Aβ derivatives synthesized in this study were consequently between 2 and 36%, indicating that the average coupling yield of each condensation step was 95-97.5%. Their molecular weights were confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS, and their purity was determined by HPLC analysis (>98%). Aggregative Ability and Neurotoxicity of the Proline-substituted Aβ42 Mutants at Positions 15-32—We focused at first on the residue 22 that frequently mutates in cerebral amyloid angiopathy such as E22Q (Dutch) (25Levy E. Carman M.D. Fernandez-Madrid I.J. Power M.D. Lieberburg I. van Duinen S.G. Bots G Th A.M. Luyendijk W. Frangione B. Science. 1990; 248: 1124-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar) and E22K (Italian) (26Tagliavini F. Rossi G. Padovani A. Magoni M. Andora G. Sgarzi M. Bizzi A. Savoiardo M. Carella F. Morbin M. Giaccone G. Bugiani O. Alzheimer's Rep. 1999; 2: S28Google Scholar) and investigated the proline-substituted Aβ42 mutants at positions 15-32. Their aggregative ability was estimated by the two methods, the sedimentation assay (HPLC analysis after centrifugation of the Aβ solution) and the Th-T fluorescence assay. Since Williams et al. (14Williams A.D. Portelius E. Kheterpal I. Guo J. Cook K.D. Xu Y. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) used thermodynamic stabilities of the Aβ40 fibrils to obtain its structural information, we examined the thermodynamic stabilities of several Aβ42 mutants that were reported as a preliminary communication (15Morimoto A. Irie K. Murakami K. Ohigashi H. Shindo M. Nagao M. Shimizu T. Shirasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows the critical concentration (Cr) defined as the molar concentration of soluble Aβ42 peptides present at equilibrium along with the aggregative ability estimated by the sedimentation assay (Fig. 2A) and the Th-T fluorescence assay (Fig. 2B), which were generally correlated with each other. Fairly good correlation was observed between the kinetics and thermodynamics data. E22P-Aβ42 with rapid aggregation kinetics showed a lower Cr value (0.42 μm) compared with wild-type Aβ42 (0.85 μm). On the other hand, V18P-, F19P-, and F21P-Aβ42 with slower aggregation kinetics exhibited higher Cr values (15, 17, and 17 μm, respectively). It is noteworthy that the Cr value of wild-type Aβ42 (0.85 μm) determined by us is almost equal to that of wild-type Aβ40 (0.90 μm) reported by Williams et al. (14Williams A.D. Portelius E. Kheterpal I. Guo J. Cook K.D. Xu Y. Wetzel R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Since Aβ42 aggregated far more rapidly than Aβ40 as shown in Fig. 2, A and B, aggregation kinetics rather than thermodynamics seems to be more important in Aβ42. Thus, we adopted the kinetics data to deduce the secondary structure of Aβ42 in its aggregates. As shown in Fig. 3A, all of the proline-substituted Aβ42 mutants at positions 15-32 with the exception of E22P-Aβ42 hardly aggregated after 8 h of incubation. Only the data of the sedimentation assay are shown, because the HPLC data are more reliable than the Th-T fluorescence data as reported previously (22Murakami K. Irie K. Morimoto A. Ohigashi H. Shindo M. Nagao M. Shimizu T. Shirasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46179-46187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained after 16 and 24 h of incubation with the exception of V18P-, F19P-, G25P-, and A30P-Aβ42 that showed slow but significant aggregation kinetics (data not shown). It is quite noticeable that only E22P-Aβ42 aggregated faster than wild-type Aβ42. The neurotoxic effects on the PC12 cells of these Aβ42 mutants were examined by MTT assay to confirm whether their aggregation reflects the pathological aggregation of wild-type Aβ42. The MTT assay consists of the conversion of MTT to colored formazan by mitochondrial reductase and serves as an indirect measurement of cell proliferation and viability. After a 48-h incubation with each Aβ42 derivative, formazan formation was measured at 600 nm in a concentration range of 0.01-10 μm. Because wild-type Aβ42 inhibited ∼50% formazan formation at 10-6.5m, the formazan formation in the presence of 10-6.5m each proline-substituted Aβ42 peptide was measured simultaneously to estimate precisely the relative neurotoxicity (Fig. 3A). The results showed that only E22P-Aβ42 potently inhibited the formazan formation at 10-6.5m. The IC50 value of inhibition of the formazan formation by E22P-Aβ42 was 0.084 ± 0.011 μm, whereas that of wild-type Aβ42 was 0.97 ± 0.18 μm. Although only D23P-Aβ42 showed significant neurotoxicity at 10-6.5m (IC50 = 1.3 ± 0.26 μm), other Aβ42 mutants were almost inactive at 10-6.5m. Effects of the C-terminal Residues of Aβ42 on Its Aggregative Ability and Neurotoxicity—It is obvious that the C-terminal two residues of Aβ42 play a critical role in its aggregative ability and neurotoxicity. Weinreb et al. (27Weinreb P.H. Jarrett J.T. Lansbury Jr., P.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 10835-10836Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) proposed the “hypothesis of hydrophobic cluster,” stating that hydrophobic interaction among the side chains at the C terminus induces aggregation (Fig. 4A). In this hypothesis, Ile-41 is incorporated in the hydrophobic core formed by Leu-34 and Met-35. To confirm the role of the hydrophobic side chains at the C terminus of Aβ42, the hydrophilic threonine mutants at positions 41 or 42 (I41T- and A42T-Aβ42) were prepared and examined for their aggregative ability and neurotoxicity (Fig. 4B). Both I41T- and A42T-Aβ42 aggregated rapidly similar to wild-type Aβ42. Substitution with Thr did not abolish their cytotoxic effects. The IC50 values of the cytotoxicity on PC12 cells were 1.1 ± 0.11, 0.70 ± 0.10, and 0.97 ± 0.18 μm for I41T-, A42T-, and wild-type Aβ42, respectively, suggesting that hydrophobicity of the side chains at positions 41 and 42 is not requisite for the aggregative ability and neurotoxicity of Aβ42. Because it is conceivable that the C-terminal residues participate in the β-sheet formation, a series of the proline-substituted Aβ42 mutants at positions 33-42 were synthesized and their aggregative ability and neurotoxicity were tested. As shown in Fig. 3B, the aggregative ability of L34P- and G38P-Aβ42 as estimated by the sedimentation assay was significantly higher than that of wild-type Aβ42. Both aggregated almost completely after a 4-h incubation (only the data after an 8-h incubation is shown in Fig. 3B). G33P- and V39P-Aβ42 also showed significant aggregative ability. Although G38P- and V39P-Aβ42 showed potent neurotoxicity comparable with wild-type Aβ42, the neurotoxicity of G33P- and L34P-Aβ42 was weak regardless of its significant aggregative ability (Fig. 3B). M35P-, V36P-, G37P-, V40P-, I41P-, and A42P-Aβ42 did not aggregate, even after a 24-h incubation (data not shown). They were almost inactive in the neurotoxicity assay (Fig. 3B). Effects of the N-terminal Residues of Aβ42 on Its Aggregative Ability and Neurotoxicity—Because the C-terminal three residues play a critical role in the aggregative ability and neurotoxicity of Aβ42, the contribution of the N-terminal residues to the activities was also investigated. Aβ3-42 lacking the N-terminal two residues of Aβ42 aggregated potently with velocity quite similar to that of wild-type Aβ42 (data not shown) and showed significant neurotoxic effects. The IC50 values of Aβ3-42 and wild-type Aβ42 were 0.043 ± 0.010 and 0.97 ± 0.18 μm, respectively. This indicates that the N-terminal two residues are not necessary for the aggregative ability and neurotoxicity of Aβ42. To identify the β-sheet-forming region at the N-terminal portion, proline-substituted Aβ42 mutants at positions 3-13 were synthesized and examined for their aggregative ability and neurotoxicity (Fig. 3C). All of the mutants at positions 3-13 aggregated potently and exhibited significant neurotoxic effects. Transmission Electron Micrographs of Negatively Stained Preparations of the Fibrils Formed from the Proline-substituted Aβ42 Mutants—Fibril formation of the proline-substituted Aβ42 mutants with potent aggregative ability was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy after a 48-h incubation at 37 °C. N-terminal proline-substituted Aβ42 mutants at positions 3-13 and E22P-, L34P-, G38P-, V39P-, I41T-, and A42T-Aβ42 exhibited typical fibril formation, several examples of which are shown in Fig. 5. The fibrils of E22P-Aβ42 have been reported previously (22Murakami K. Irie K. Morimoto A. Ohigashi H. Shindo M. Nagao M. Shimizu T. Shirasawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46179-46187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The morphologies of these fibrils resembled each other well. The aggregation of Aβ peptides is significantly related to the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration in AD. Despite many previous studies on the structural analysis of Aβ aggregates, the precise mechanism has not yet been clarified. To obtain information on the structure of Aβ42 fibrils, we adopted the proline-scanning method proposed by Wood et al. (12Wood S.J. Wetzel R. Martin J.D. Hurle M.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Thirty-four proline-substituted Aβ42 mutants were synthesized in high purity using the method recently established by us (19Fukuda H. Shimizu T. Nakajima M"
https://openalex.org/W2013507458,"The biological activities of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-17 have been widely studied. However, comparatively little is known about how IL-17 expression is controlled. Here, we examined the basis for transcriptional regulation of the human IL-17 gene. IL-17 secretion was induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells following anti-CD3 cross-linking to activate the T cell receptor (TCR), and costimulatory signaling through CD28 strongly enhanced CD3-induced IL-17 production. To define cis-acting elements important for IL-17 gene regulation, we cloned 1.25 kb of genomic sequence upstream of the transcriptional start site. This putative promoter was active in Jurkat T cells following CD3 and CD28 cross-linking, and its activity was inhibited by cyclosporin A and MAPK inhibitors. The promoter was also active in Hut102 T cells, which we have shown to secrete IL-17 constitutively. Overexpression of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) or Ras enhanced IL-17 promoter activity, and studies in Jurkat lines deficient in specific TCR signaling pathways provided supporting evidence for a role for NFAT. To delineate the IL-17 minimal promoter, we created a series of 5′ truncations and identified a region between -232 and -159 that was sufficient for inducible promoter activity. Interestingly, two NFAT sites were located within this region, which bound to NFATc1 and NFATc2 in nuclear extracts from Hut102 and Jurkat cells. Moreover, mutations of these sites dramatically reduced both specific DNA binding and reporter gene activity, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed occupancy of NFAT at this region in vivo. Together, these data show that NFAT is the crucial sensor of TCR signaling in the IL-17 promoter. The biological activities of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-17 have been widely studied.

Similarly, IL-17-deficient mice exhibit reduced airway hypersensitivity responses as well as other immune impairments (14Nakae S. Komiyama Y. Nambu A. Sudo K. Iwase M. Homma I. Sekikawa K. Asano M.

Compared with the extensive studies of the biological activities of IL-17, considerably less is known about regulation of IL-17 expression. In humans, IL-17 mRNA is largely found in activated CD4+ memory T cells (16Fossiez F. Djossou O. Chomarat P. Flores-Romo L. Ait-Yahia S. Maat C. Pin J.-J. Garrone P. Garcia E. Saeland S. Blanchard D.

Spriggs M.K. Armitage R.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5483-5486PubMed Google Scholar). In mice, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells produce similar levels of IL-17 upon cross-linking of the T cell receptor (TCR) (20Happel K.I. Zheng M. Young E. Quinton L.J. Lockhart E. Ramsay A.J. Shellito J.E. Schurr J.R. Bagby G.J. Nelson S. Kolls J.K. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4432-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Although some reports indicate that IL-17 is made by Th0 and Th1 cells, other reports implicate Th2 cells (21Aarvak T. Chabaud M. Miossec P. Natvig J.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1246-1251PubMed Google Scholar, 22Infante-Duarte C. Horton H.F. Byrne M.C. Kamradt T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6107-6115Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well described cytokine IL-2, CD28 costimulation only mildly enhances IL-17 production in mouse primary cells. 2X. K. Liu, J. L. Clements, and S. L. Gaffen, unpublished data. Under in vitro conditions, the mitogen phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the cytokine IL-15 have been shown to stimulate T cells to produce IL-17 (23Ziolkowska M. Koc A. Luszczukiewicz G. Ksiezopolksa-Pietrzak K. Klimczak E. Chwalinska-Sadowska H. Maslinski W. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2832-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Furthermore, data in mice show that lipopolysaccharide, acting through Toll-like receptor-4, stimulates dendritic cells to secrete IL-23, which in turn triggers IL-17 production by T cells (20Happel K.I. Zheng M. Young E. Quinton L.J. Lockhart E. Ramsay A.J. Shellito J.E. Schurr J.R. Bagby G.J. Nelson S. Kolls J.K. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 1910-1914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). However, in IL-23-deficient mice, antigen-presenting cells exhibit only a partially diminished capacity to trigger IL-17 production by T cells, indicating that IL-23 is not the only route to IL-17 production (25Ghilardi N. Kljavin N. Chen Q. Lucas S. Gurney A. de Sauvage F.J. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2827-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we recently found that neither dendritic cells nor IL-23 were necessary for promoting short term production of IL-17, although they can enhance its expression ∼2-fold. 2X. K. Liu, J. L. Clements, and S. L. Gaffen, unpublished data. Pharmacological inhibitor studies have suggested that TCR-stimulated expression of IL-17 is calcineurin- and cAMP-dependent (23Ziolkowska M. Koc A. Luszczukiewicz G. Ksiezopolksa-Pietrzak K. Klimczak E. Chwalinska-Sadowska H. Maslinski W. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2832-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism(s) by which T cells generate IL-17 are largely unknown. In contrast to IL-17, the signaling mechanisms by which activated T cells drive expression of other cytokines such as IL-2 have been extensively analyzed (26Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 413-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 27Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin.

Academic Press, Ltd., London, UK1998: 73-103Google Scholar). The TCR-CD3 complex is activated following recognition of a peptide-major histocompatibility complex complex on an antigen-presenting cell. TCR-CD3 signaling alone only causes relatively small amounts of IL-2 to be released. For optimal IL-2 production, further costimulation by CD28 interacting with B7–1 or B7–2 on the antigen-presenting cell is required. Together, these interactions lead to a highly complex signaling program, which causes nuclear import of several key transcription factors, including nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), NF-κB, and AP-1, which ultimately activate transcription of the IL-2 gene. Specifically, engagement of the TCR-CD3 complex leads to activation of the tyrosine kinases ZAP-70, p56-Lck, and Itk. These in turn phosphorylate adaptor molecules such as SLP76 and LAT, which bind to and recruit various key signaling enzymes. In particular, phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) becomes phosphorylated, leading to generation of the second messenger molecules inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 triggers rapid Ca2+ release from intracellular stores, which activates the phosphatase calcineurin, permitting dephosphorylation and nuclear import of the transcription factor NFAT (reviewed in Ref. 26Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 413-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). DAG activates protein kinase C pathways, particularly PKCθ, which leads to activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. However, signaling through CD28 is necessary for maximal activation of NF-κB. A recently discovered key mediator of CD28 signaling is the scaffold protein CARMA1, which assembles numerous signaling molecules in a complex necessary for NF-κB activation (29Wang D. You Y. Case S.M. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Wang L. DiStefano P.S. Nunez G. Bertin J. Lin X. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 830-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 30Wang D. Matsumoto R. You Y. Che T. Lin X. Gaffen S. Lin X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition, signaling through CD3 and CD28 activates MAPK pathways through Ras and JNK, leading to activation of the c-Fos and c-Jun, transcription factors that together comprise the AP-1 DNA binding complex. Together, NFAT, NF-κB, and AP-1 act in concert on the IL-2-proximal promoter, resulting in potent transcription of the IL-2 gene (reviewed in Refs. 27Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar and 31Gaffen S. Liu K.D. Cytokine. 2004; 28: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined mechanisms of TCR-induced IL-17 production in a tissue culture model. First, we found that, in contrast to mouse cells, CD28 costimulation triggers a substantial increase in IL-17 production in human T cells. Moreover, both the calcineurin/NFAT pathway and MAPK pathways are required for IL-17 production, and we have identified two NFAT binding sites within the proximal promoter that are critical for TCR-mediated regulation of the human IL-17 gene. Cell Isolation, Tissue Culture, and ELISA—Peripheral blood was purchased from Biological Specialty Corp. (Colmar, PA), and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma) gradient centrifugation. 106 cells were cultured in 96-well plates in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3), and/or anti-CD28 (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or PMA/ionomycin (Biomol International, Plymouth Meeting, PA) for 24 or 48 h. Jurkat and Hut102 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Woodland, CA), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine (Invitrogen). Supernatants were analyzed for IL-17 by ELISA per the manufacturer's instructions (BioSource Europe S.A., Nivelles, Belgium). PCR, Plasmids, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—The transcriptional start point of the IL-17 gene was determined by 5′-RACE (data not shown). PCR primers were designed to subclone sequences 1125 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site based on data in the human genomic DNA data base (NT_007592), and the resulting product was confirmed by sequencing. Oligonucleotide primers used in cloning (MWG Biotech, High Point, NC) were as follows: h17p(-1125)-Luc (5′-ACGCGTGGATCTCAGGACAAACAGGTTC-3′) and h17p-downstream (5′-AAGCTTGACTCACCACCAATGAGGTCTT-3′). The truncated forms of IL-17 promoter were created using the following primers: h17p(-924)-Luc, 5′-ACGCGTCCCTTCCTTGTCCTAGTCCTCT-3′; h17p(-739)-Luc, 5′-ACGCGTCTCCATCACCTTTGTCCAGTC-3′; h17p(-352)-Luc, 5′-ACGCGTGAGCATAACTCTTCTGGCAGC-3′; h17p(-232)-Luc, 5′-ACGCGTCATGAATTTCTGCCCTTCCC-3′; and h17p(-159)-Luc, 5′-ACGCGTTAACCAAAATGGTGTCACCCC-3′. All were cloned into the pGL3-enhancer vector at the MluI and HindIII sites (Promega, Madison, WI). The h17p(TATA)-Luc construct was created by annealing two oligonucleotides, 5′-CGCGTAAGCCCTATAAAAAGAGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCTCTTTTTATAGGGCTTA-3′, creating overhangs to allow direct subcloning into pGL3-enhancer. All enzymes were from MBI Fermentas (Hanover, MD). The pSRα-NFATc1 construct was provided by Dr. Colleen Sheridan, and the pCMV5-Ras construct was obtained from Dr. Warner Greene. For transfections, 1 × 107 cells in triplicate were resuspended in 400 μl of RPMI 1640 with 5–20 μg of reporter plasmid, 0–15 μg of NFATc1 or Ras plasmids, and 20 ng of the Renilla luciferase plasmid. Cells were electroporated at 250 V, 950 microfarads on a GenePulser electroporator (Bio-Rad). Twenty-four hours later, cells were stimulated for 6 h and lysed, and supernatants were analyzed for luciferase activity on an Orion MPL2 luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Oak Ridge, TN). EMSA, Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (CHIP) Assays—EMSAs were performed as described previously (32Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Xu W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Goldsmith M.A. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7192-7196Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) with 10 μg of nuclear extract and 105 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe per sample. The sequences of the wild-type NFAT and AP-1 oligonucleotide probes were as follows (top strand only): 5′-CGCCCAAAGAGGAAAATTTGTTTCATA-3′ and 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′. The mutant NFAT sequence was 5′-CGCCCAAAGCTTAAAATTTGTTTCATA-3′ (mutation site underlined). The anti-NFAT Abs (sc-1149), anti-NFATc1 (sc-7394), and anti-NFATc2 (sc-7296) and an isotype-matched nonspecific Ab used for supershifting were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Western blotting was performed as described previously (33Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Ha M. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Greene W.C. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21381-21390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Abs to phosphorylated JNK (Ab 9251), phosphorylated p38 (Ab 9211), JNK (Ab 9252), and p38 (Ab 9212) were purchased from Cell Signaling Inc. (Beverly, MA). Abs to phosphorylated ERK (sc-7383) and ERK (sc-154) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. CHIP assays were performed using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), following the manufacturer's protocol with modifications. In brief, 5 × 106 Hut102 cells were stimulated with PMA/ionomycin for 30 min and then fixed with 1% formaldehyde (final concentration) for 15 min at room temperature. Cross-linking reactions were quenched with 250 μm glycine. Cells were briefly lysated with 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and nuclei were collected by centrifugation. 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer was added to the nuclei for 10 min on ice. Cell lysates were sonicated to shear the chromatin into 200–500-bp fragments, and debris was removed by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, 2 μg of anti-NFATc1 or anti-IgG1 were incubated with cell lysates overnight at 4 °C with rotation. 30 μl of Protein G beads (Roche Applied Science) was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Beads were then washed with low salt immune complex wash buffer, high salt immune complex wash buffer, LiCl immune complex wash buffer, and TE for 3–5 min in sequence. DNA-protein complexes were eluted with 500 μl of elution buffer, and cross-links were reversed at 65 °C overnight in the presence of 20 μl of 5 m NaCl. Proteins were digested with 10 mg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C, and DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen (Roche Applied Science). Specific DNA was amplified by PCR with primers spanning -159 to +34 of the IL-17 promoter. Human IL-17 Is Produced by Primary Lymphocytes Stimulated through the TCR—Since the signals that regulate IL-17 production remain poorly defined, we examined IL-17 secretion in primary human PBMCs in response to standard T cell stimuli, including agonistic Abs to CD3 and CD28. Upon receptor cross-linking for 24 or 48 h with anti-CD3 Abs alone, PBMCs secreted detectable levels of IL-17, as assessed by ELISA (Fig. 1). Stimulation with anti-CD28 Abs alone did not induce IL-17 production. However, signaling from both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 markedly enhanced IL-17 production (2.5- or 4-fold at 24 and 48 h, respectively). PMA/ionomycin treatment, which bypasses TCR signaling by mimicking the second messengers IP3 and DAG produced by PLCγ1, also resulted in potent IL-17 production. This pattern of regulation was strikingly different from that observed in mouse primary cells, in which costimulation with anti-CD28 Abs only weakly enhances IL-17 secretion above that induced by anti-CD3 Abs alone.2 These results indicate that human IL-17 is induced following TCR stimulation and that costimulatory signaling from CD28 further increases IL-17 production. The 1-kb Region Upstream of the IL-17 Gene Is Biologically Active in Human T Cell Lines—The expression of most T cell-derived cytokines is regulated at least in part by the initiation of transcription. To explore regulation of IL-17 transcription, the transcriptional start point was first determined by 5′-RACE (data not shown and Fig. 2A). Interestingly, the transcriptional start point we identified was slightly different from those previously reported (16Fossiez F. Djossou O. Chomarat P. Flores-Romo L. Ait-Yahia S. Maat C. Pin J.-J. Garrone P. Garcia E. Saeland S. Blanchard D. Gaillard C. Das Mahapatra B. Rouvier E. Golstein P. Banchereau J. Lebecque S. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 5483-5486PubMed Google Scholar) and was located 51 bases downstream of the TATA box. Next, we cloned ∼1.2 kb of 5′-flanking sequence upstream of the identified transcriptional start point using PCR primers based on sequence information from the human genomic data base. According to results from the AliBaba2.1 binding site prediction program, this sequence contained putative sites for a number of transcription factors frequently implicated in cytokine gene regulation, including AP-1, NF-κB, and NFAT. This putative IL-17 promoter was subcloned upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (termed h17p(-1125)-Luc), and its activity was examined in the Jurkat human T cell line. In Jurkat cells transfected with h17p(-1125)-Luc, stimulation with anti-CD3 Abs caused an increase in reporter gene activity (Fig. 2B). Although the increase was only about 2-fold, this finding was highly reproducible and is probably attributable to a high background of luciferase activity commonly observed using pGL3-based luciferase vectors (34Bert A. Burrows J. Osborne C. Cockerill P. Plasmid. 2000; 44: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Similar to primary cells, the reporter gene activity induced by anti-CD3 was further enhanced by cross-linking with anti-CD28 Abs but not by anti-CD28 alone. This induction is specific to elements within the promoter, because a construct containing only the TATA box derived from the hIL-17 promoter did not show reporter gene activity upon CD3 or CD3/CD28 cross-linking and was only slightly enhanced by PMA/ionomycin stimulation. Thus, activity of the h17p(-1125)-Luc construct appears to mirror regulation of IL-17 in primary human T cells. Calcineurin/NFAT and MAPK Signaling Pathways Are Involved in IL-17 Production—As an initial step to exploring potential signaling pathways involved in IL-17 regulation, we first assessed the effects of several pharmacological inhibitors known to block production of both IL-2 and IL-17. We transfected Jurkat cells with the IL-17 promoter (i.e. h17p(-1125)-Luc), stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 Abs with or without inhibitors, and then compared luciferase activities with mock-treated samples. Cyclosporin A (CsA) acts by blocking the phosphatase calcineurin, which is responsible for activating the NFAT family of transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 35Hogan P.G. Chen L. Nardone J. Rao A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2205-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). At a dose of 100 nm CsA, IL-17 promoter activity was largely blocked (Fig. 3A), consistent with other work that implicates calcineurin in IL-17 gene regulation (23Ziolkowska M. Koc A. Luszczukiewicz G. Ksiezopolksa-Pietrzak K. Klimczak E. Chwalinska-Sadowska H. Maslinski W. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2832-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar).2 Subsequently, we examined MAPK pathways using the inhibitors SP600125 (which blocks JNK and p38) and PD98059 (which blocks ERK) (Fig. 3B). Reporter gene activity was also blocked by both SP600125 and PD98059, indicating that the MAPK pathway is involved in IL-17 regulation. In all cases, these inhibitory effects were not due to nonspecific cellular toxicity, since all cells were equally viable throughout the experiment (data not shown). Furthermore, in EMSA experiments, the CsA inhibitor specifically blocked DNA binding of NFAT but not AP-1 (Fig. 3C). Conversely, the JNK/p38 and ERK inhibitors specifically blocked DNA binding of AP-1 but not NFAT. These data indicate that TCR-mediated activation of the calcineurin and MAPK pathways is upstream of IL-17 promoter activity. A highly valuable feature of the Jurkat cell line is the availability of subclones specifically defective in particular TCR signaling intermediates. Therefore, to further define signaling pathways involved in IL-17 transcriptional regulation, the h17p(-1125)-Luc construct was transfected into Jurkat cells defective in p56-Lck (JCaM1.6 (36Goldsmith M.A. Weiss A. Science. 1988; 240: 1029-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 37Straus D.B. Weiss A. Cell. 1992; 70: 585-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar)), PLCγ1 (Jγ1 (38Irvin B.J. Williams B.L. Nilson A.E. Maynor H.O. Abraham R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9149-9161Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)), or CARMA1 (JPM50.6 (29Wang D. You Y. Case S.M. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Wang L. DiStefano P.S. Nunez G. Bertin J. Lin X. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 830-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar)). The tyrosine kinase p56-Lck acts early in the TCR-CD3 signaling cascade and lies upstream of nearly all CD3-dependent signals. Thus, as expected, h17p(-1125)-Luc displayed no activity in Lck(-) cells following TCR stimulation (Fig. 4A) (whereas the internal Renilla luciferase control was expressed at normal levels; data not shown). PLCγ1 is a phospholipase responsible for the generation of the DAG and IP3 messengers, which are in turn required for PKCθ- and calcium-dependent signals of the TCR, including both NF-κB and NFAT. Consequently, in Jγ1 cells, all signals downstream of PLCγ are absent. No activity of the hIL-17 promoter was observed in PLCγ1(-) cells, consistent with a role for the NFAT and/or NF-κB pathways. However, when PLCγ1 signaling was bypassed by stimulation with PMA (a DAG analog), inducible luciferase activity was restored to levels equivalent to that of wild type Jurkat cells (Fig. 4B). This control experiment indicated that signals downstream of PLCγ1 remain intact in these cells and that signaling through PLCγ1 lies upstream of IL-17 promoter activity. Finally, CARMA1 is a recently identified scaffold molecule that mediates protein kinase C (PKC)-θ-induced NF-κB activation and hence is crucial for CD3/CD28 costimulation. Notably, however, CARMA1 is not necessary for CD3-mediated activation of NFAT (29Wang D. You Y. Case S.M. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Wang L. DiStefano P.S. Nunez G. Bertin J. Lin X. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 830-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Whereas the hIL-17 promoter was fully active in CARMA1(-) cells in response to CD3 cross-linking, the contribution of CD28 cross-linking to promoter activity was eliminated (Fig. 4A). These data indicate that the contribution from CD3 is probably via NFAT, which is clearly important for hIL-17 promoter activity, whereas the contribution of CD28 depends on CARMA1. To obtain more direct evidence that the MAPK and NFAT pathways indeed act on the hIL-17 promoter, wild type Jurkat cells were co-transfected with the h17p(-1125)-Luc construct together with a 5-fold excess of Ras (to activate MAPK pathways) or NFATc1. Ras showed a marked stimulatory effect on the promoter, both at basal levels and after stimulation (Fig. 4C). Similarly, when NFATc1 was co-transfected with the hIL-17 promoter-luciferase construct, the promoter also showed enhanced activity. Thus, the Ras and NFAT pathways can transactivate the IL-17 promoter. Two Functional NFAT Binding Sites Are Located within the Minimal IL-17 Regulatory Region—To further define the regulatory sites within the IL-17 promoter, we created a series of truncations from the 5′ end of the promoter (Fig. 5A). These constructs were assayed for function in Jurkat cells stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 Abs (Fig. 5B) or PMA and ionomycin (Fig. 5C). Deletions of the 5′-flanking sequences up until -232 bp did not markedly reduce hIL-17 promoter function, although there was some variability in luciferase activity that was not reproducible (data not shown). However, deletion of 73 bp after position -232 (i.e. th"

However, the few comparative studies that exist seem to favor the lymph node tissue as a B-cell source. Here the peripheral blood and lymph node lymphocytes of a dromedary immunized with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) have been employed to clone two independent gene banks of the variable domains of heavy-chain antibodies (i.e. the VHHs). Several PSA-specific VHHs were retrieved after panning of these phage-displayed VHH libraries. Some of them were derived from the same B-cell lineage, possibly reflecting the restricted primary repertoire of heavy-chain antibodies. Other binders originated from different B-cell lineages and apparently converged toward a striking homologous amino acid sequence motif in their CDR3. This illustrates the strong somatic hypermutation and stringent antigen-driven selection ongoing in these animals. Although the various antigen binders exhibit a broad range of kinetic rate constants for their interaction with the PSA, leading to equilibrium constants from 70 pm to 100 nm, no significant difference existed between the binders from the two B-cell sources. The VHHs of both libraries were categorized in three groups based on nonoverlapping epitopes. Some of these VHHs could inhibit and others could enhance the proteolytic activity of the antigen. Remarkably, VHHs seem to sense or induce conformational changes on different PSA isoforms, a feature that might be exploited to study the PSA conformational flexibility and to discriminate the stages of prostate cancer.

Several PSA-specific VHHs were retrieved after panning of these phage-displayed VHH libraries. Some of them were derived from the same B-cell lineage, possibly reflecting the restricted primary repertoire of heavy-chain antibodies. Other binders originated from different B-cell lineages and apparently converged toward a striking homologous amino acid sequence motif in their CDR3. This illustrates the strong somatic hypermutation and stringent antigen-driven selection ongoing in these animals. Although the various antigen binders exhibit a broad range of kinetic rate constants for their interaction with the PSA, leading to equilibrium constants from 70 pm to 100 nm, no significant difference existed between the binders from the two B-cell sources. The VHHs of both libraries were categorized in three groups based on nonoverlapping epitopes. Some of these VHHs could inhibit and others could enhance the proteolytic activity of the antigen. Remarkably, VHHs seem to sense or induce conformational changes on different PSA isoforms, a feature that might be exploited to study the PSA conformational flexibility and to discriminate the stages of prostate cancer. The hybridoma technology developed by Kohler and Milstein (1Kohler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12802) Google Scholar) is a cornerstone for molecular biology and medicine as it generates a massive amount of tools with extensive application opportunities. Despite the enormous success and efficiency to obtain monoclonal antibodies from hybridomas, novel technologies have been introduced over the past 15 years aimed at a faster identification of more antigen binders in a smaller format (2Hudson P.J. Souriau C. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The phage display and ribosome display, techniques whereby a physical linkage between the genotype and phenotype of the antibody fragment is maintained during the selection, are major breakthroughs to screen an immense number of candidate antigen binders. Ingenious adaptations during the retrieval procedure allow selecting for the more stable, better expressed binders and those of higher affinity (3Smith G.P. Petrenko V.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 391-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar, 4Sieber V. Pluckthun A. Schmid F.X. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In addition, new mutations, introduced naturally or on purpose, diversify the first set of binders and are subsequently subjected to the selection process to obtain optimized binders (5Lipovsek D. Pluckthun A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 290: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To extend the application range or to tailor the antibodies to particular needs, quite diverse formats of antigen-binding entities (e.g. scFv, Fab, diabodies, etc.) that might substitute for the intact monoclonal antibodies have already been tested (2Hudson P.J. Souriau C. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The VHH, 1The abbreviations used are: VHH, variable domain of the heavy chain of a heavy-chain antibody; LNL, lymph node lymphocyte; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocyte; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; ACT, α1-anti-chymotrypsin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; mAb, monoclonal antibody; V-D-J, variable-diversity-joining. a single domain antigen-binding fragment derived from heavy-chain antibodies of camelids, occupies a particular position within these possible formats. These monomeric antibody fragments offer special advantages in terms of expression yield (6Thomassen Y.E. Meijer W. Sierksra L. Verrips C.T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2002; 30: 273-278Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), size and stability (7Dumoulin M. Conrath K. Van Meirhaeghe A. Meersman F. Heremans K. Frenken L.G. Muyldermans S. Wyns L. Matagne A. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 500-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), and ease of generating bivalent, bispecific constructs or immunoconjugates (8Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Wyns L.

Brisson J.R. Mackenzie C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Antigen-specific VHHs regularly target epitopes that are poorly immunogenic and less accessible for conventional antibodies (e.g. enzymatic clefts or phage receptors; see Refs. 10Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar and 11Ledeboer A.M. Bezemer S. de Haard H.

This creates a number of opportunities for VHHs that might be more difficult to achieve with antigen-binding fragments from classical antibodies. Antigen-specific VHHs can be retrieved after panning either a large naive VHH library displayed on phage or ribosomes (12Murugandam A. Tanha J. Narang S. Stanimirovics D. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 240-252PubMed Google Scholar, 13Yau K.J. Groves M.A. Li S. Sheedy C. Lee H. Tanha J. Mackenzie C.R. Jermutus L. Hall J.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 281: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or one that was cloned from B-cells of a llama or dromedary previously immunized with the antigen (11Ledeboer A.M. Bezemer S. de Haard H. Schaffers I.M. Verrips C.T. van Vliet C. Dusterhoft E.M. Zoon P. Frenken L.G. J.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The latter procedure has the advantage that the VHHs have been affinity-matured in vivo for the antigen so that additional and time-consuming in vitro maturation steps can be avoided (15Nguyen V.K. Desmyter A. Muyldermans S. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 261-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, the B-cell proliferation within the animal during immunization makes certain that potent antigen binders are successfully retrieved even starting from relatively small VHH libraries of 106 individual clones, for example (10Lauwereys M. Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Kinne J. Holzer W. De Genst E. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3512-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 14Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R.

Magez S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1256-1261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The dependence of the B-cell source to produce the “immune” VHH library and the performance of the VHH retrieved from such libraries have not yet been addressed. This might be an overlooked aspect because a recent study (19Basalp A. Yucel F. Hybrid. Hybridomics. 2003; 22: 329-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) revealed that more antigen-specific antibodies producing hybridoma lines were obtained from lymph node tissue compared with those from spleen or bone marrow. Although their results might be biased by the preferential fusion of lymph node B-cells to the myeloma cells, a similar preference for lymph node tissue over other lymphatic tissues to construct high quality human immunoglobulin gene libraries was also observed (20Yip Y.L. Hawkins N.J. Clark M.A. Ward R.L. Immunotechnology. 1997; 3: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this work, we generated two immune VHH libraries from the same dromedary. The VHH genes amplified from cDNA derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) constituted the first library; those from palpable lymph node lymphocytes (LNL) formed the other library. Multiple prostate-specific antigen (PSA) binding VHHs were retrieved from both libraries, some of which were originating from the same B-cell lineage. The number, sequence variation, and performance of these various VHHs derived from the two lymphatic tissues were compared in terms of antigen affinity, epitope recognition, and effect on the enzymatic activity of the antigen. The PSA was chosen as antigen because it is the most widely used target for early prostate cancer screening (21Wan X.S. Xu Y.A. Ware J.H. Kennedy A.R. Prostate. 2003; 56: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the PSA circulating in blood occurs in different forms, i.e. as free protein or complexed with ACT (22Mikolajczyk S.D. Marks L.S. Partin A.W. Rittenhouse H.G. Urology. 2002; 59: 797-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It seems that the diagnosis of prostate cancer is far more reliable if several of these forms can be quantified individually, as the presence of some of those isoforms are better correlated with prostatic disorders than others (23Linton H.J. Marks L.S. Millar L.S. Knott C.L. Rittenhouse H.G. Mikolajczyk S.D. Clin. Chem. 2003; 49: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Mikolajczyk S.D. Song J. Wong J.R. Matson R.S. Rittenhouse H.G. Clin. Biochem. 2004; 37: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is essential to possess more than one set of antibodies that can discriminate among the different PSA isoforms; therefore, we compared the binding characteristics of the isolated VHHs (21Wan X.S. Xu Y.A. Ware J.H. Kennedy A.R. Prostate. 2003; 56: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Immunization of Dromedary—One female dromedary (Camelus dromedarius) kept at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (Dubai, United Arab Emirates) was injected seven times subcutaneously at weekly intervals with 500 μg of purified prostate-specific antigen (DiaMed) mixed in Gerbu adjuvant (GERBU Biochemicals). Forty five days after the start of the immunization, 50 ml of anticoagulated blood was collected, from which plasma and peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated (WAK-Chemie). At the same time, parts of the cervicales superficiales ventrales lymph node were retrieved via biopsy. Prior to the collection of lymph node, sedation was performed by the intravenous administration (jugular vein) of 0.05 mg/kg xylazine (Bayer AG). Sternal recumbency occurred ∼5–10 min following xylazine injection. The biopsy site (lymphocentrum cervicale superficiale) was washed and shaved. Following skin disinfection by the topical application of 70% alcohol, local anesthesia was achieved by the subcutaneous injection of 2% lidocaine hydrochloride (Abbott). A stab incision was made with a scalpel through the skin overlying the lymph node. To obtain the biopsy, a disposable biopsy needle (Cook Veterinary products) was used. Several pieces of the lymph node were taken, and some were treated with trypsin to further enhance the isolation of lymphocytes. The lymph node parts were kept in RNAlater (Ambion) during transport from Dubai (United Arab Emirates) to Brussels (Belgium). Fractionation of IgG Subclasses—Separation of the different plasma IgG subclasses was performed by differential adsorption on Hitrapprotein A and Hitrap-protein G columns (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (16Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Library Construction—The mRNA was extracted from the peripheral blood lymphocytes and from the lymph node lymphocytes using Quick-prep™ micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). In a subsequent step the cDNA was prepared using Ready-to-Go™ You-Prime-First-Strand beads (Amersham Biosciences). The gene fragments encoded the variable domain until the CH2 domain was amplified, with the specific primers CALL001 (5′-GTCCTGGCTCTCTTCTACAAGG-3′) and CALL002 (5′-GGTACGTGCTGTTGAACTGTTCC-3′), annealing at the leader sequence and at the CH2 exon of the heavy chains of all dromedary immunoglobulins, respectively. The 600-bp fragment (VHH-CH2 without CH1 exon) was eluted from an agarose gel after separation from the 900-bp fragment (VH-CH1-CH2 exons). Because all VHHs belong to the same family (family III), they could be amplified with one additional PCR with nested primers annealing at the framework 1 (5′-GATGTGCAGCTGCAGGAGTCTGGAGGAGG-3′) and framework 4 (5′-GGACTAGTGCGGCCGCTGCAGACGGTGACCTGGGT-3′) regions. The final PCR fragments were ligated into the phagemid vector pHEN4 (14Ghahroudi M.A. Desmyter A. Wyns L. Hamers R. Muyldermans S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), using the restriction sites PstI and NotI. Ligated material was transformed in Escherichia coli cells (TG1) and plated. The colonies were scraped from the plates, washed, and stored at –80 °C in LB medium supplemented with glycerol (50% final concentration). Selection of Specific Antibody Fragments—The VHH library was expressed on phage after infection with M13K07 helper phages. Specific VHHs against PSA were enriched by three consecutive rounds of in vitro selection on biotinylated PSA captured on a microtiter plate coated with 10 μg of Neutravidin™ Biotin Binding Protein (Pierce) per well. Bound phage particles were eluted with 100 mm triethylamine (pH 10.0). The eluted particles were immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and used to infect exponentially growing E. coli TG1 cells. The enrichment of phage particles carrying the antigen-specific VHHs were assessed by comparing the number of phages eluted from wells with captured versus noncaptured antigen. After the second and third round of panning, individual colonies were picked, and expression of soluble periplasmic VHH was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The recombinant VHH extracted from the periplasm was tested for antigen recognition in an ELISA. Expression and Purification of Antibody Fragments—The VHH genes of the clones that scored positive in ELISA were recloned into the expression vector pHEN6 (16Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), using the restriction enzymes PstI and BstEII. The plasmid constructs were transformed into E. coli WK6 cells. Production of recombinant VHH was performed in shaker flasks by growing the bacteria in Terrific Broth (25Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.1% glucose and ampicillin until an absorbance at 600 nm between 0.6 and 0.9 was reached. VHH expression was then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at 28 °C. After pelleting the cells, the periplasmic proteins were extracted by osmotic shock (26Skerra A. Pluckthun A. Science. 1988; 240: 1038-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). This periplasmic extract was loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid super-flow Sepharose column (Qiagen), and after washing, the bound proteins were eluted with an acetate buffer (pH 4.7). The eluted fraction was neutralized and concentrated on Vivaspin concentrators (Vivascience) with a molecular mass cutoff of 5 kDa. The purity of the protein was checked by SDS-PAGE. The final yield was determined from the UV absorption at 280 nm, and the theoretical extinction coefficient of the VHH was calculated for its amino acid content. Solid-phase ELISA—Maxisorb 96-well plates (Nunc) were coated overnight at 4 °C with Neutravidin or a PSA-specific monoclonal antibody 3E6 (DiaMed) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline. Residual protein-binding sites in the wells were blocked for 2 h at room temperature with 1% casein in phosphate-buffered saline. After 1 μg/ml biotinylated PSA (DiaMed) was captured onto the Neutravidin coating, or PSAfree (DiaMed) onto monoclonal antibody 3E6 coating, we added serial dilutions of purified IgG subclasses, virions from different rounds of panning or soluble VHHs to the wells. Detection of PSA-bound IgG, M13 virions, or VHH was performed with a rabbit anti-dromedary IgG antiserum, a horseradish peroxidase anti-M13 conjugate (Amersham Biosciences), or a mouse anti-hemagglutinin decapeptide tag (Nabco) or a mouse anti-histidine tag (Serotec), respectively. Subsequent detection of the rabbit antiserum or the mouse anti-tag antibodies was done with an alkaline phosphatase anti-rabbit or anti-mouse conjugate (Sigma), respectively. The absorption at 405 nm was measured 15 min after addition of the substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate or 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzathiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) for phosphatase or peroxidase conjugates, respectively. Epitope Mapping ELISA—Either Neutravidin (5 μg/ml) or a PSA-specific monoclonal antibody 3E6 (5 μg/ml) was coated in the wells of a microtiter plate, followed by addition of 1 μg/ml (non-)biotinylated PSA (DiaMed) or PSA-ACT (SCIPAC) complex (ACT is the α1-antichymotrypsin inhibitor of PSA). Bound VHH was detected with an anti-histidine tag monoclonal antibody (Serotec) or Nickel Express Doctor (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories), respectively. BIAcore Measurements—Affinity measurements were assessed by addition of different concentrations of PSA (DiaMed) to purified Histailed VHHs attached on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid biochip (BIAcore) according to the manufacturer's descriptions. The kinetic and equilibrium parameters (kon, koff, and KD) were determined with the BIAevaluation software version 3.0 (BIAcore). The same procedure was followed to characterize the binding to the PSA isoforms from SCIPAC: PSAfree, PSA-non-ACT binding, and PSA-ACT complex. Enzyme Kinetic Measurements—The PSA enzymatic activity was determined by the hydrolysis of 0.1 mm substrate MeO-Suc-Arg-Pro-Tyr-p-nitroanilide-HCl (S-2586; Chromogenix). PSA (333 nm) was incubated at 25 °C with a 10 m excess of purified VHH in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.8). The initial velocity of hydrolysis of the substrate was measured for 15 min at 405 nm in an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). The hydrolysis velocity caused by 333 nm PSA in the absence of VHH is set at 100%. A dromedary was immunized with PSA over a period of 7 weeks. The immunoglobulins were purified from plasma by differential adsorption on protein A and protein G, yielding 1.2, 1.8, and 0.7 mg of IgG1, IgG2, and IgG3 per ml of plasma, respectively. An antigen-specific response as assessed by ELISA was observed for the heavy-chain antibodies (IgG2 and IgG3) and conventional antibodies (IgG1) (27Pleschberger M. Saerens D. Weigert S. Sleytr U.B. Muyldermans S. Sara M. Egelseer E.M. Bioconjugate Chem. 2004; 15: 664-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The antigen-binding gene fragments of the heavy-chain antibodies from the immunized dromedary were cloned. Two different libraries were constructed in parallel, each starting from ∼1.5 × 107 lymphocytes. One library was made from the (PBL and the other from the LNL. Each VHH library contained ∼1.5 × 107 individual transformants of which 87% of clones had an insert of proper size as determined by PCR on individual colonies. The VHH repertoire from both libraries was expressed on phages after rescuing with M13K07 helper phage. Three rounds of panning were performed on biotinylated PSA captured by Neutravidin coated on the microtiter plates. This approach was preferred because the passive coating of PSA on microtiter plates has been reported to provoke protein denaturation resulting in loss of conformational epitopes (28Wu P. Leinonen J. Koivunen E. Lankinen H. Stenman U.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6212-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The enrichment of antigen-specific clones during the consecutive rounds of panning was assessed by a “phage ELISA” on biotinylated PSA captured by a Neutravidin coating upon addition of a fixed amount of virions (109) per well (Fig. 1). The highest anti-PSA titer was obtained for virions after the second round of panning, independent of the VHH library that was used. Isolation of PSA Specific VHHs—From both libraries, 36 and 24 individual colonies were randomly picked after the 2nd and 3rd round of panning, respectively, and cultured to produce soluble VHH. The VHH clones derived from the PBL or LNL library were named Cx or Nx, respectively (with x indicating a serial number from 1 to 60). The periplasmic extracts were tested individually in an ELISA for the presence of PSA-specific VHHs (Table I). The success rate of identifying positive scoring clones for this antigen was higher for the library derived from PBL (90%) than that from LNL (65%). However, the number of different PSA-specific clones retrieved from the LNL library exceeded those from the PBL libraries. The nucleotide sequence analysis of the VHHs revealed 11 and 14 distinct PSA binders from the PBL and from the LNL libraries, respectively. Twelve clones were unique to the LNL panning, and nine were retrieved only from the PBL library. Two sets of clones sharing the same amino acid sequences were retrieved from both libraries. Only one representative of N8 and N37 is given in Fig. 2, although these binders also occurred in the PBL library (C12 and C11, respectively).Table IScoring results of antigen-specific VHH from randomly picked colonies after the second and third round of panningOriginPBLLNLRound 234/3625/36Round 321/2414/24Total55/6039/60No. ≠ clones1114 Open table in a new tab Sequence Alignment of the PSA-specific VHHs—The deduced amino acid sequences of all PSA-specific antibody fragments are aligned against the human VH consensus sequence (Fig. 2). For the VHHs retrieved from the LNL library, it is clear that the clones N4, N7, N9, N14, N20, N23, N24, N25, and N50 are derived from heavy-chain antibody-specific VHH germ line genes, as they contain the hallmark amino acid substitutions in framework 2 (Val-37 → Tyr/Phe, Gly-44 → Glu, Leu-45 → Arg, Trp-47 → Xaa; see Ref. 15Nguyen V.K. Desmyter A. Muyldermans S. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 261-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Fewer fragments containing these hallmark substitutions were isolated from the PBL library; however, they are clearly present in VHH clones C2, C7, C8, C17, and C23. Although several other clones from both libraries do not harbor the VHH hallmark amino acid substitutions, there is substantial evidence that these are also derived from heavy-chain antibodies since the gene for the variable fragment attached to conventional H-chain was eliminated by agarose gels (see “Experimental Procedures”). Moreover the Trp-103 → Arg or Trp-103 → Gln mutation present in these clones will undoubtedly disrupt the interaction with a variable domain of a light chain (29Desmyter A. Spinelli S. Payan F. Lauwereys M. Wyns L. Muyldermansn S. Cambillau C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23645-23650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Extra cysteines residing in the CDR1 and CDR3 and forming an interloop disulfide bond are frequently observed in dromedary VHHs (30Conrath K. Muyldermans S. Nguyen V.K. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2003; 27: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An extra pair of cysteines in the antigen binding loops is also present in nearly half of the anti-PSA fragments irrespective of the starting library. The CDR3 length varies from 7 to 18 amino acids with an on average longer CDR3-loop length for the clones derived from the LNL library (13.4 amino acids) compared with the PBL library (12.8 amino acids). The shorter CDR3 in the latter is because of a larger representation of the clones without VHH hallmark and a mutation at position 103, which tend to have a shorter CDR3 without Cys. Five of our PSA binders (one from the LNL library, two from the PBL library, and two clones found in both libraries) possess a Gly-Ala-Leu sequence pattern (GAL) in their CDR3, suggesting that those VHHs might bind to the same epitope. It is surmised that the binders with the GAL sequence are derived from at least three different B-cell lineages as there are three binders with a GAL sequence in the beginning of a CDR3 of 7 amino acids (clones N3, C1, C11, = N37), one binder has the GAL motif at the start of an 8 amino acids long CDR3 (N8 = C12) that probably resulted from a different D-J recombination, and one binder where the GAL occurs halfway the CDR3 of 8 amino acids as well (C23). The comparison of the GAL codons and their nucleotide surroundings suggest that different D genes have been employed during the V-D-J recombination followed by a convergent evolution toward the same amino acids upon antigen maturation. From the binders with a 7-amino acid-long CDR3, the N3 and N37 (= C11) are definitely clonally related and thus derived from the same V-D-J recombination event (one nucleotide difference in a 15-nucleotide stretch containing the GAL codons). The third member of this CDR3 length might originate from another B-cell lineage as it contains 6 or 7 nucleotide differences with the former clones in the same stretch. The nucleotide differences among the other GAL motif containing binders of different V-D-J origin were also 6–8 for the corresponding region of 15 nucleotides. Clones C9 and C24 share an identical amino acid sequence from the beginning of the framework 2 until the end of their framework 4, i.e. including CDR2 and CDR3, but have a different CDR1 sequence amino. These clones are most likely derived from the same B-cell lineage, although a PCR crossover artifact might have caused the sequence variation (31Sinkora M. Sun J. Butler J.E. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). VHH Expression—All the binders were recloned into an expression vector (pHEN6) (16Conrath K.E. Lauwereys M. Galleni M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. Kinne J. Wyns L. Muyldermans S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2807-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The induced recombinant is transported to the periplasm of E. coli and is carrying a histidine tag that facilitates purification by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography. After an additional gel filtration chromatography, >95% pure protein was obtained as deduced from Coomassie staining of the SDS-PAGE. The overall yield of purified VHH varied between 0.1 and 6 mg per liter of culture and was clone-dependent. However, no significant difference in the range of expression and purification yield was noticed between the PBL- and LNL-derived clones and also not between the VHHs carrying the framework 2 hallmark substitutions and those having a nonconventional amino acid at position 103. VHH Epitope Mapping—Pure antibody fragments were prepared and tested in ELISA to define their epitope on PSA. Binding to PSA was assessed in ELISA by using different coating methods of PSA or different PSA forms, e.g. by capturing PSAfree or PSA-ACT on the PSA-specific monoclonal antibody 3E6 or by capturing b"
https://openalex.org/W2105044044,"Ecological theory predicts that competition for a limiting resource will lead to the exclusion of species unless the within-species effects outweigh the between-species effects. Understanding how multiple competitors might coexist on a single resource has focused on the prescriptive formalism of a necessary niche width and limiting similarity. Here, we show how continuously varying life histories and trade-offs in these characteristics can allow multiple competitors to coexist, and we reveal how limiting similarity emerges and is shaped by the ecological and evolutionary characteristics of competitors. In this way, we illustrate how the interplay of ecological and evolutionary processes acts to shape ecological communities in a unique way. This leads us to argue that evolutionary processes (life-history trait trade-offs) are fundamental to the understanding of the structure of ecological communities."

Dpr2 is localized in late endosomes, binds to the TGFβ receptors ALK5 and ALK4, and accelerates lysosomal degradation of these receptors."

Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a causative agent of gastroenteritis endemic in Southeast Asia, has a type III secretion system that encodes a novel member of the YopJ-like protein effector family, VopA (Vibrioouter protein A). Our studies revealed that Vibrio VopA encodes an evolutionarily conserved activity that is extremely potent and requires an intact catalytic site to abrogate signaling pathways in a manner distinct from that of other YopJ-like effectors. We observed that VopA efficiently inhibits the MAPK signaling pathways but not the NFκB pathway in mammalian cells. When expressed in yeast, VopA induces a growth arrest phenotype and also blocks yeast MAPK signaling pathways. Our observations provide insight into the immense diversity of targets utilized by YopJ-like effectors to manipulate eukaryotic signaling machineries that are important for the response and survival of the host cell during infection and/or symbiosis.

The Gram-negative marine bacterium Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a major agent responsible for gastroenteritis outbreaks associated with the consumption of infected seafood (1McCarter L. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar). Areas of recent outbreaks range from the coastal regions of North America to Eastern Asia. The bacterial pathogen Yersinia pestis is the causal agent for the bubonic plague, whereas Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Yersinia enterocolitica are causal agents for gastrointestinal disorders (2Cornelis G.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Salmonella typhimurium is a facultative intracellular pathogen that causes gastroenteritis, and because it is carried by a variety of animal hosts, it is of increasing concern to the food industry in the developed world (3Prager R. Rabsch W. Streckel W. Voigt W. Tietze E. Tschape H. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2003; 41: 4270-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All three pathogens harbor pathogenicity islands that encode a type III secretion system, which is used to inject effector proteins into the host cytoplasm. Effector proteins are molecules that mimic a eukaryotic activity and are used by pathogens to disrupt signaling in the infected cell. All three of the aforementioned bacterial pathogens encode an effector protein that belongs to the family of YopJ-like proteins. YopJ, the founding member of this family, is an effector protein expressed by Yersinia spp. that is able to block the innate immune response in infected target cells (4Orth K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Expression of cytokines and anti-apoptotic factors are prevented during a Yersinia infection because YopJ is able to inhibit MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; HOG, high osmolarity growth. signaling pathways and the NFκB pathway by preventing the activation of the superfamily of MAPK kinases (5Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Later studies demonstrated that the family of YopJ-like proteins encodes a cysteine protease domain and that the wild type but not the catalytically inactive forms are able to inhibit signaling pathways (6Orth K. Xu Z. Mudgett M.B. Bao Z.Q. Palmer L.E. Bliska J.B. Mangel W.F. Staskawicz B. Dixon J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 1594-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The family of YopJ-like proteins is found in a wide variety of animal and plant pathogens as well as the plant symbiont Rhizobium (4Orth K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 7Staskawicz B.J. Mudgett M.B. Dangl J.L. Galan J.E. Science. 2001; 292: 2285-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The effector AvrA from S. typhimurium is the only other YopJ-like protein from an animal pathogen studied to date and is implicated in the inhibition of the NFκB pathway (8Collier-Hyams L.S. Zeng H. Sun J. Tomlinson A.D. Bao Z.Q. Chen H. Madara J.L. Orth K. Neish A.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2846-2850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). V. parahaemolyticus is phylogenetically close to Vibrio cholerae (the causative agent of cholera), and recent sequencing of the V. parahaemolyticus genome reveals the existence of two pathogenicity islands (PAI and PAII), which are not found in V. cholerae (9Makino K. Oshima K. Kurokawa K. Yokoyama K. Uda T. Tagomori K. Iijima Y. Najima M. Nakano M. Yamashita A. Kubota Y. Kimura S. Yasunaga T. Honda T. Shinagawa H. Hattori M. Iida T. Lancet. 2003; 361: 743-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Encoded within PAII is a type III secretion system and an effector protein, referred to as VopA, sharing ∼55% similarity with the YopJ-like proteins from Yersinia and Salmonella (9Makino K. Oshima K. Kurokawa K. Yokoyama K. Uda T. Tagomori K. Iijima Y. Najima M. Nakano M. Yamashita A. Kubota Y. Kimura S. Yasunaga T. Honda T. Shinagawa H. Hattori M. Iida T. Lancet. 2003; 361: 743-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). V. parahaemolyticus is a bacteria that is associated with two hosts: shellfish and human. Within shellfish, it exists as a commensal, whereas in humans, it is an incidental pathogen (acquired by eating contaminated shellfish). YopJ-like effectors are expressed by a number of bacteria, including pathogens, commensals, and symbionts. These effector proteins, like other type III secreted virulence factors, are expressed by the bacteria and injected into the target host cell where they manipulate the host machinery. Our studies reveal that VopA, encoded by V. parahaemolyticus, is able to manipulate eukaryotic signaling machineries, and this may be of use during its existence as a commensal or incidental pathogen. Herein, we observe that VopA functions in a mechanistically similar manner to other YopJ-like proteins but demonstrates a remarkable diversity in its inhibitory profile of signaling pathways. Cloning of Effectors—VopA was amplified by PCR from V. parahaemolyticus genomic DNA with a 5′-HindIII primer and a 3′-FLAG-stop-ApaI primer and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pSFFV. The VopA alanine mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit. VopA and VopA C167A were amplified by PCR using pSFFV VopA or pSFFV VopA C167A as template with 5′-EcoRI and 3′-FLAG-stop-XhoI primers and cloned into the yeast expression vector pRS413 under control of the GAL promoter. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. MAPK Assays—293T cells were transfected with or without a MAPK (HA-ERK; 100 ng) in the presence or absence of YopJ-like effector plasmids (100 ng). And after 48 h of growth, cells were starved for 3 h followed by treatment or no treatment with a stimulus (epidermal growth factor, 50 ng/ml). Cells lysates were analyzed by immunoblot analysis with rabbit anti-phospho-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) and mouse anti-HA antibody (Babco). YopJ-like effectors were detected using mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). NFκB Assays—293T and HeLa cells were transfected with or without FLAG-IκB (1 μg) in the presence or absence of YopJ-like effector plasmids (50 ng). After 36 h of growth, 293T cells were treated with TNFα (50 ng/ml) for 30 min, and HeLa cells were treated with interleukin-1β (10 ng/ml) for 15 min. Cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot analysis with rabbit anti-phospho-IκB antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc) and mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma). Death Assays—Jurkat cells were transiently transfected using a BTX ECM electroporator (260 V, 1050 microfarads, 720 ohms) with 10 μg of each plasmid and 2 μg of pMEM-YFP membrane-bound yellow fluorescent protein (Clontech) as a transfection marker. Twenty-four hours later, cells were left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml human TNFα for ∼18 h. Death was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of annexin V-activated protein C binding and propidium iodide. Live cell percentages were calculated as the percentage of yellow fluorescent protein-positive cells that were annexin V and propidium iodide negative. Specific cell death was calculated using the formula 100 × (1– TNF treated/untreated) for the live cell percentages in each condition. Yeast Growth and MAPK Assays—Yeast cells expressing the indicated empty vector or the YopJ-like effector plasmids were assayed for growth by plating on glucose media, galactose media, or galactose media containing 1 m sorbitol. For growth curves, overnight cultures grown in glucose were diluted back to an OD of 0.1 in 20 ml of indicated media, and the absorbance was measured at 600 nm. For MAPK assays, yeast cells containing either an empty vector or YopJ, YopJ C/A, VopA, or VopA C/A vectors under control of the galactose promoter were grown to mid-log phase in glucose media and then shifted to galactose media to induce protein expression for 3 h. Cells were then induced with either 0.7 m sorbitol for 2.5 min or 12 mm caffeine for 1 h. Protein extract from these cells were isolated as described in Yoon et al. (10Yoon S. Liu Z. Eyobo Y. Orth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2131-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-p38 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) or anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-FLAG antibody, and anti-porin antibody (loading control). Accession Numbers—The GenBank™ accession number for YopJ is AY606230 and for VopA is AY597337. Lack of Inhibition of NFκB Pathway by VopA—We examined whether Vibrio VopA is able to inhibit the induction of innate immune response by blocking the NFκB pathway in a manner similar to other YopJ-like effector proteins (5Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 8Collier-Hyams L.S. Zeng H. Sun J. Tomlinson A.D. Bao Z.Q. Chen H. Madara J.L. Orth K. Neish A.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2846-2850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type YopJ and VopA and the catalytically inactive forms of these effectors (YopJC172A or VopAC167A) along with FLAG-tagged IκB were transfected into 293T cells or HeLa cells and then stimulated with either TNFα or interleukin-1β, respectively. Surprisingly, VopA demonstrated no inhibitory activity on the NFκB signaling pathway. Neither wild-type VopA nor the catalytically inactive VopAC167A are able to inhibit the phosphorylation of IκB with either stimulus (TNFα or interleukin-1β) (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). In NFκB luciferase reporter assays, VopA is unable to inhibit TNFα-induced activity. 2M. Roberts and R. M. Siegel, unpublished observations. Taken together, these observations support the hypothesis that VopA has no effect on the NFκB pathway, which is in contrast to the two other YopJ-like effectors from animal pathogens, YopJ and AvrA. VopA Inhibits the Mammalian MAPK Pathways—Yersinia YopJ is able to inhibit MAPK signaling pathways, so we next assessed the ability of Vibrio VopA to inhibit the mammalian MAPK pathways. 293T cells were transfected with various YopJ-like effectors in the presence of HA-ERK followed by treatment with epidermal growth factor (5Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Both wild-type YopJ and VopA, but not the catalytically inactive forms of these effectors (YopJC172A or VopAC167A), are able to inhibit extracellular growth factor-induced ERK activation (Fig. 2A). In a similar fashion, both YopJ and VopA are able to inhibit the other MAPK pathways. 3J. E. Trosky and K. Orth, unpublished observations. These studies provide the first evidence that Vibrio VopA is able to inhibit mammalian signaling pathways. However, the various YopJ-like effectors appear to target distinct sets of signaling pathways within the eukaryotic cell, because in contrast to YopJ, no interaction is observed between VopA and the family of MAPK kinases in yeast two-hybrid binding assays. 3J. E. Trosky and K. Orth, unpublished observations. Both YopJ and VopA are very efficient at inhibiting the MAPK pathways, but detecting the expression of these YopJ-like proteins is extremely difficult (Fig. 2A). To determine the potency of inhibition by these effectors, we analyzed their MAPK inhibitory activity over a range of expression conditions. Inhibition of the MAPK signaling pathway is observed with as little as 1 ng of YopJ- or VopA-transfected DNA. Although the inhibition of the MAPK pathways is comparable between the two effectors, the amount of YopJ-FLAG protein appears to be at least 10-fold greater than that of VopA-FLAG (as detected by anti-FLAG immunoblots) (Fig. 2B). The Role of VopA in Programmed Cell Death—Having established a profile of inhibitory activity for these YopJ-like effectors, we wanted to investigate what role these effectors (independent of other pathogenic factors) play on the fate of an infected cell. We utilized the well established system in lymphoma cells whereby TNFα-induced apoptosis is prevented by the induction of the NFκB pathway resulting in the expression of anti-apoptotic factors (11Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar, 12Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar, 13, Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). Effectors were transfected into Jurkat cells and following stimulation with TNFα, were assessed for survival (Fig. 3). Cell death was not observed in control cells in the presence or absence of stimulus. Wild-type YopJ, but not the catalytically inactive form of YopJ, is able to efficiently promote cell death in Jurkat cells but only in the presence of stimulus, which supports the hypothesis that the Yersinia YopJ effector does not directly activate death machinery but promotes cell death by the blocking of signaling pathways. The ability of VopA to promote cell death in the presence of stimulus is marginal (Fig. 3) and cannot be attributed to blocking the NFκB pathway but may result as an indirect consequence of its extremely potent inhibition of the MAPK pathways. Expression of VopA in Yeast Causes a Growth Arrest Phenotype—One of the characteristics of bacterial pathogenic effectors secreted by a type III secretion system is that their usurped eukaryotic activities are evolutionarily conserved. Studies with Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a galactose-inducible YopJ plasmid demonstrated that the mechanism used by YopJ to inhibit the MAPK signaling pathways is evolutionarily conserved (10Yoon S. Liu Z. Eyobo Y. Orth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2131-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To initially test the effect that VopA has on the MAPK pathways in yeast, strains containing this effector and its mutant counterpart, under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter, were grown to mid-log phase in glucose media followed by plating onto glucose or galactose media. When yeast cells containing VopA plasmid are plated on galactose, thereby inducing the expression of VopA, the yeast cells are unable to grow (Fig. 4D). In contrast, yeast cells expressing the catalytically inactive VopAC167A are able to grow on galactose media. Yeast cells expressing VopA when scraped off the galactose plates are able to recover and grow when plated on glucose plates, supporting the idea that the catalytic activity of the Vibrio effector, VopA, induces a growth arrest phenotype (data not shown). Using liquid growth culture studies, we observed the effects on the growth of yeast cells expressing various forms of YopJ-like proteins. Yeast cells containing a control vector or vector expressing YopJ, YopJ C172A, or VopA C167A grow at approximately the same rate (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the growth of VopA-expressing yeast cells is dramatically hindered, but they continue to grow, albeit at a slower rate than the other strains (Fig. 4B). In cells expressing VopA, growth arrest is observed over an extended period of time, indicating that the growth arrest is not likely to be a cell cycle-dependent defect. The phenotype is dependent on wild-type VopA and not the catalytically inactive form of VopA, indicating that the mechanism of inhibition is similar to other YopJ-like effectors but that the targets are distinct. Inhibition of MAPK Pathways by VopA Is Evolutionarily Conserved—To investigate whether VopA, like YopJ, inhibits MAPK signaling pathways in yeast, cells containing the various effectors were plated on galactose media with 1 m sorbitol, which results in the activation the high osmolarity growth (HOG) MAPK pathway (10Yoon S. Liu Z. Eyobo Y. Orth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2131-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As expected, yeast expressing either YopJ or VopA, but not the catalytically inactive mutants, plated on galactose media containing 1 m sorbitol are unable to grow (Fig. 4D). Consistent with our observations in mammalian systems, Salmonella AvrA shows no obvious inhibitory affect on the MAPK pathways in yeast (data not shown). When yeast expressing YopJ or VopA are grown in liquid media containing 1 m sorbitol, the growth phenotype is quite striking (Fig. 4C). Growth is almost immediately arrested in the presence of VopA, whereas in the presence of YopJ, the growth arrest requires more time. These observations further emphasize the difference in targets between YopJ and VopA and indicate that the growth arrest phenotype in the presence of VopA does not depend only on the inhibition of the activated HOG MAPK pathway. To test the ability of VopA to inhibit the HOG MAPK pathway, yeast cells were grown in glucose media to mid-log phase and then transferred to galactose media to induce expression of the YopJ-like proteins. These cells were incubated with sorbitol, and the lysates of cells were analyzed for induction of the HOG MAPK pathway (10Yoon S. Liu Z. Eyobo Y. Orth K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2131-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Yeast cells containing either a control vector or the plasmids encoding catalytically inactive forms of YopJ or VopA are able to activate Hog1p via phosphorylation, whereas wild-type YopJ and VopA inhibit Hog1p activation (Fig. 5A). Similar results are observed using caffeine to induce the cell wall integrity MAPK pathway (14Akeda Y. Kodama T. Kashimoto T. Cantarelli V. Horiguchi Y. Nagayama K. Iida T. Honda T. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); yeast cells expressing wild-type YopJ or VopA, but not their mutant counterparts, are unable to induce the activation of Mpk1p via phosphorylation in this pathway (Fig. 5B). VopA, like YopJ, inhibits evolutionarily conserved MAPK signaling pathways in yeast, but unlike YopJ, demonstrates the ability to induce a growth arrest phenotype in yeast indicating a distinct set of targets for VopA. The profiles of inhibition for each of the mammalian YopJ-like effectors are clearly distinct. VopA potently blocks the evolutionarily conserved MAPK pathways, YopJ blocks MAPK pathways and the NFκB pathway (5Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and AvrA blocks only the NFκB pathway (8Collier-Hyams L.S. Zeng H. Sun J. Tomlinson A.D. Bao Z.Q. Chen H. Madara J.L. Orth K. Neish A.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2846-2850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). Each pathogen has evolved to encode a YopJ-like effector displaying a unique inhibitory activity that requires a common catalytic site (Fig. 6B) that benefits its respective pathogen in different ways. The activity of Yersinia YopJ complements its fellow effectors by blocking the production of cytokines and anti-apoptotic machinery, thereby preventing the induction of the innate immune response and promoting apoptosis. Salmonella AvrA does not affect MAPK signaling in mammalian cells or yeast3 but does inhibit the NFκB pathway (8Collier-Hyams L.S. Zeng H. Sun J. Tomlinson A.D. Bao Z.Q. Chen H. Madara J.L. Orth K. Neish A.S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 2846-2850Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), albeit weakly, and does abrogate the constitutive degradation of β-catenin (15Sun J. Hobert M.E. Rao A.S. Neish A.S. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: G220-G227Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This inhibitory activity results in c-Myc-induced proliferation of the infected cell, which may prolong the life of the infected cell and allow for propagation of an intracellular pathogen (15Sun J. Hobert M.E. Rao A.S. Neish A.S. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: G220-G227Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Vibrio VopA, which we have shown to be an extremely potent inhibitor of the evolutionarily conserved MAPK pathways, may function to inhibit cytokine production resulting in attenuation of the host defense response. The activity of VopA along with other virulence factors could facilitate colonization in the intestine of humans resulting in propagation of the pathogen. Alternatively, VopA may by used to attenuate signaling while existing as a commensal in the shellfish host. Currently, only laborious animal models (e.g. the ligated rabbit ileal loop model) exist for studying V. parahaemolyticus (16Nishibuchi M. Kaper J.B. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 2093-2099Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but systems to study infection by V. parahaemolyticus using a tissue culture-based approach are currently being developed. 4J. E. Trosky, L. McCarter, and K. Orth, unpublished observations. In summary, three different types of intestinal pathogens have usurped a structurally conserved and mechanistically similar activity in the form of a YopJ-like effector. Recent studies suggest that this activity was originally captured by the plant bacterial pathogen, Xanthomonas, which expresses not only YopJ-like effectors (encoding remote similarity to a ubiquitin-like protein protease (Ulp1)) but also the effector XopD (a member of the Ulp1 protein family) (4Orth K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17Hotson A. Chosed R. Shu H. Orth K. Mudgett M.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). XopD is a constitutively active enzyme with plant-specific deSUMOylating enzyme activity (17Hotson A. Chosed R. Shu H. Orth K. Mudgett M.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These observations support a hypothesis that pathogenic bacteria have usurped the Ulp1 hydrolase activity. The catalytic domain of this molecule may then have been transformed into a unique activity that is maintained and used by a specific pathogen for targeting and inhibiting a distinct set of signaling pathways for the advantage of the pathogen during infection of the host. As YopJ effectors are maintained and expressed by both plant and animal pathogens as well as a plant symbiont (and most likely in yet to be discovered animal commensals), they provide powerful tools for identifying critical steps in eukaryotic signaling machineries that are important for host response and survival during infection and/or symbiosis.

https://openalex.org/W2051630798,"Like most vertebrates, humans die within minutes when deprived of molecular oxygen (anoxia), in part because of cardiac failure. In contrast, some freshwater turtles can survive anoxia for months at low temperatures, but to do so, they drastically suppress cardiac activity and autonomic cardiovascular control. Although Carassius carassius , the crucian carp, shares this anoxia tolerance, we show that it has a unique ability among vertebrates to retain normal cardiac performance and autonomic cardiovascular regulation for at least 5 days of anoxia. These responses point to an unusual tolerance of a vertebrate heart and autonomic nervous system to prolonged anoxia."

[PSI+] and [PIN+] provide invaluable tools in the investigation of the principles of organization and interactions among amyloid aggregates in vivo.Sup35p is an essential protein, and in the non-prionized soluble form, referred to as [psi–], it is involved in the termination of protein translation. In [PSI+] cells the pool of active Sup35p is severely depleted causing reduced translational termination efficiency (for reviews see Refs. 12Wickner R.B. Liebman S.W. Saupe S.J. Prusiner S.B.

When in the [PIN+] state, Rnq1p dramatically enhances the rate of [PSI+] appearance, possibly by templating the prion conformation of Sup35p (11Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Hong J.Y. Liebman S.W.

Stable inheritance of the yeast prions requires each cell to contain discrete prion aggregates that can migrate to daughter cells during budding (20Eaglestone S.S. Ruddock L.W. Cox B.S. Tuite M.F.

Strong evidence supports the idea that Hsp104p maintains a sufficient number of prion aggregates by shearing them, thus securing successful prion transmission in the growing culture. Guanidine hydrochloride in non-denaturing concentrations blocks Hsp104p activity, which leads to an uncontrolled growth of the Sup35p polymers followed by prion loss (15Kryndushkin D.S.

Interestingly, although guanidine often causes the simultaneous loss of [PSI+] and [PIN+] in two-prion [PSI+] [PIN+] cells, they can also be lost independently (7Derkatch I.L. Bradley M.E. Zhou P. Chernoff Y.O. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1997; 147: 507-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This independence raises the question of whether two-prion cells contain homogeneous or heterogeneous prion bodies.Like human amyloidogenic proteins, Sup35p and Rnq1p form self-seeding amyloid fibers in vitro (10Sondheimer N.

Funct. 2003; 28: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has also been shown recently that preformed Rnq1p fibers facilitate polymerization of the Gln/Asn-rich domain of Sup35p (17Derkatch I.L. Uptain S.M. Outeiro T.F. Krishnan R. Lindquist S.L. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12934-12939Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Using fluorescently labeled Sup35p and Rnq1p, newly forming Sup35p aggregates that appeared during [PSI+] induction were found to co-localize with Rnq1p aggregates. However, once [PSI+] was established, the fluorescent aggregates co-localized less frequently (17Derkatch I.L. Uptain S.M. Outeiro T.F. Krishnan R. Lindquist S.L. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12934-12939Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that [PIN+] aggregates interact with Sup35p and template [PSI+] induction. Interestingly, a number of other Gln/Asn-rich proteins can substitute for [PIN+], suggesting the importance of Gln/Asn-rich sequences in the physiology of amyloid formation (11Derkatch I.L.

Bull. 2003; 66: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), can exist as different “strains,” also called variants, determined by a specific conformation of the prion molecules (34Bessen R.A.

Weak [PSI+] variants are generally less mitotically stable than strong [PSI+] variants (19Derkatch I.L. Chernoff Y.O. Kushnirov V.V. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have more non-prionized (soluble) Sup35p molecules in the cytoplasm (29Uptain S.M. Sawicki G.J. Caughey B. Lindquist S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 38Zhou P. Derkatch I.L. Uptain S.M. Patino M.M. Lindquist S. Liebman S.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In a cross of strong and weak [PSI+] haploids the diploids and their progeny exhibit the strong [PSI+] phenotype, implying that strong [PSI+] variants are “dominant” over weak (19Derkatch I.L. Chernoff Y.O. Kushnirov V.V. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Zhou P. Derkatch I.L. Uptain S.M. Patino M.M. Lindquist S. Liebman S.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1182-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, whether the prion variant dominance phenomenon is confined to a phenotypic dominance only (i.e. aggregates of both variants co-exist) or is accompanied by a complete elimination of the “recessive” variant aggregates.[PIN+] variants have been distinguished by their fluorescent pattern of Rnq1p-green fluorescent protein fusion staining (mostly single large fluorescent dots (s.d.) 1The abbreviations used are: s.d., single dot; m.d., multiple dot; SDD-AGE, semi-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; PEB, protein extraction buffer; AP, antiprotease; TLCK, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone.1The abbreviations used are: s.d., single dot; m.d., multiple dot; SDD-AGE, semi-denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; PEB, protein extraction buffer; AP, antiprotease; TLCK, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone.versusmultiple small (m.d.) fluorescent dots per cell) (39Bradley M.E. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by the efficiency with which they facilitate the induction of [PSI+], ranging from low to very high (32Bradley M.E. Edskes H.K. Hong J.Y. Wickner R.B. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16392-16399Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Variant dominance was shown to correlate inversely with the amount of non-prionized Rnq1p (32Bradley M.E. Edskes H.K. Hong J.Y. Wickner R.B. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16392-16399Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Therefore it appears that the dominance of a prion variant is determined by the efficiency with which its aggregates recruit new molecules (32Bradley M.E. Edskes H.K. Hong J.Y. Wickner R.B. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16392-16399Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 39Bradley M.E. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is supported by the finding that protein extracts from cells carrying strong [PSI+] variants were capable of converting non-prionized Sup35p into fibers more efficiently than the extracts from weak [PSI+] (29Uptain S.M. Sawicki G.J. Caughey B. Lindquist S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 40Kochneva-Pervukhova N.V. Chechenova M.B. Valouev I.A. Kushnirov V.V. Smirnov V.N. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Yeast. 2001; 18: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Interestingly, s.d. [PIN+] variants known to facilitate [PSI+] induction are also capable of making weak [PSI+] highly mitotically unstable (39Bradley M.E. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was unclear, however, whether [PIN+] directly affects [PSI+], for example by forming heterogeneous prion particles. Answering this question requires an understanding of the intracellular organization of the [PSI+] and [PIN+] aggregates in two-prion [PSI+] [PIN+] cells.In this study we characterize [PIN+] prion aggregates isolated from different [PIN+] variants. We show that prions in two-prion cells, i.e. [PSI+][PIN+], form isolated structures devoid of tight interactions at every organizational level. We provide biochemical data showing that prion variant dominance is indeed accompanied by the elimination of the “recessive” variant. Finally, we show that prion loss is not always accompanied by changes in the size of the prion particles.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains—Derivatives of 74D-694 (MATa ade1–14 ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1–289 his3–200 [psi–] [pin–]) (L1751) (41Chernoff Y.O. Derkach I.L. Inge-Vechtomov S.G. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) carry [PIN+] variants with different [PSI+] induction strength. “Original” high m.d. [PIN+] (L1749), low s.d. [PIN+] (L1943), medium s.d. [PIN+] (L1945), high s.d. [PIN+] (L1767ψ–), and very high s.d. [PIN+] (L1953) were used. [PSI+] induction strength of L1767ψ–was detected as described elsewhere (32Bradley M.E. Edskes H.K. Hong J.Y. Wickner R.B. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16392-16399Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). [PSI+] variants were induced in L1749 by overexpressing Sup35p from pGAL::SUP35 resulting in weak [PSI+] m.d. [PIN+] (L1765) and strong [PSI+] m.d. [PIN+] (L1762). A weak [PSI+] high s.d. [PIN+] derivative was obtained by overexpressing Sup35p in L1767ψ–resulting in L1767 (32Bradley M.E. Edskes H.K. Hong J.Y. Wickner R.B. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16392-16399Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). L1767 was used as a cytoplasm donor for kar1-d15 canR cyhR [psi–][pin–][rho–] derivatives of L1845 (MATα ade1–14 ura3–52 leu2–3,112 trp1–289 his3–200) bearing either the wild type Rnq1p or the rnq1::KANMX4 allele, resulting in weak [PSI+] high s.d. [PIN+] (L2633), and weak [PSI+] Δrnq1 (L2668), respectively. A derivative of c10B-H49 (SUQ5 ade2–1 lys1–1 his3–11,15 leu1 kar1–1 cyhR [rho–] [psi–] [pin–]) (L1957) was cytoduced with L1749, L1943, L1945, and L1953 resulting in [psi–] strains carrying m.d. (L1998), low s.d. (L1991), medium s.d. (L1992), and very high (L1996) [PIN+] variants, respectively (39Bradley M.E. Liebman S.W. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These strains were crossed to L1767ψ–. The diploids resulting from these crosses were selected on the media deficient in adenine.Preparation of Yeast Cell Lysates—Yeast cultures were grown in liquid YPD media to A600 of 1.5–2.0. For investigations of the effect of guanidine hydrochloride, cells were grown in YPD to A600 of 1.5–2.0, and then cultures were divided in half, and the initial volume was reconstituted with YPD. Guanidine HCl was added to 7 mm final concentration to one of the cultures, and cells were grown until the A600 of the diluted cultures doubled. The cells were harvested, washed with water, resuspended, and lysed by vortexing with 0.5-mm glass beads in a protein extraction buffer containing antiproteases (PEB/AP: 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA-Na, 5% glycerol, 100 μm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone (TLCK), 100 μm l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 94 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and “protease inhibitor mixture for yeast” (Sigma, 1:50)). Crude lysates were precleared by 1 min of centrifugation at 600 × g at 4 °C. Such a short preclearing step allows for efficient preservation of prion aggregates that may pellet along with the cell debris upon higher speed or longer duration of spin. Protein concentration was determined as described (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213288) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay.Analysis of Yeast Cell Lysates—For sucrose gradient analyses, fresh lysates with or without the addition of SDS to 2% were incubated for 7 min at room temperature and fractionated at 4 °C in a swinging bucket rotor through a 20–60% continuous sucrose/PEB gradient for 40 min at 10,600 × g, unless indicated otherwise. Equal fractions were collected from top to bottom, diluted 1:2 in PEB/AP, resolved in a 10% polyacrylamide gel as described (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar), and transferred to an immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Sup35p was detected using BE4 monoclonal antibodies against the Sup35p C-terminal domain. Rnq1p was detected by polyclonal antibodies (a kind gift from S. Lindquist). Signal was revealed using a Tropix kit (Applied Biosystems) as suggested by the manufacturer. To stain the membrane with different antibodies, it was stripped twice by incubation for 30 min in 0.2 m glycine (pH 2.2) containing 1% SDS and 1% Tween 20. Using this procedure we obtained the same images regardless of which antibodies were used first.Semi-denaturing detergent agarose gel electrophoresis (SDD-AGE) was performed as described elsewhere (15Kryndushkin D.S. Alexandrov I.M. Ter-Avanesyan M.D. Kushnirov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49636-49643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) with the following changes. Lysates were incubated for 7 min in sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue) at the indicated temperatures, resolved in a horizontal 1.5% agarose gel in a standard Tris/glycine/SDS buffer, transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with antibodies as described above. An increase of the final SDS concentration in the sample to 7.5% did not affect the mobility of prion subparticles (not shown). A preparation of chicken pectoralis extract (a kind gift from T. Keller) was used to estimate molecular weight (44Kim K. Keller T.C. II I J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When stained with Coomassie, chicken pectoralis extract reveals several abundant muscular proteins: titin (∼3000 kDa), nebulin (∼750 kDa), and myosin heavy chain (∼200 kDa). Although this ladder cannot be used for precise determination of molecular mass, it does provide an estimate.Comparison of the levels of soluble Rnq1p was performed as described elsewhere (32Bradley M.E. Edskes H.K. Hong J.Y. Wickner R.B. Liebman S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16392-16399Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) with the following changes. Lysates were obtained as mentioned above, equalized by protein to 4 mg/ml with PEB, and spun for 10 min at 10,000 × g for additional preclearing. Supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 280,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of supernatants were compared by Western analysis as described above. Equal amounts of protein were loaded according to anti-Sup35p and Coomassie staining.RESULTSRnq1p Is Assembled into Heavy SDS-sensitive Aggregates in [PIN+] Cells—To assay the structural organization of Rnq1p-containing prion particles, lysates from [psi–] derivatives of 74D-694 differing only by the presence or absence of [PIN+] were fractionated through a sucrose gradient and probed for the presence of Rnq1p. The Rnq1p from the [pin–] derivative did not penetrate into the gradient and was mostly retained in the first fraction (Fig. 1). On the other hand, prionized Rnq1p from a m.d. [PIN+] derivative was found in virtually all gradient fractions. However, when the [PIN+] lysate was treated with 2% SDS before being applied to the gradient, most of the Rnq1p formerly in the heavier fractions now sedimented in the first fraction. The small amount of Rnq1p retained in the fifth and heaviest fraction may hold the heaviest Rnq1p-containing aggregates that are less susceptible to SDS treatment or may be aggregates that were dragged down along with cell debris and thus rendered less accessible by SDS molecules. These results show that [PIN+] cells contain prionized Rnq1p in the form of heavy SDS-unstable particles, henceforth referred to as prion aggregates.[PIN+] Prion Subparticles Are Variant-specific, Possess Different Physical Properties, and Increase in Size upon Guanidine Treatment—To determine whether the slowest sedimenting fraction of SDS-treated [PIN+] lysates contained small SDS-stable prion subparticles, we analyzed lysates of 74D-694 [psi–] derivatives carrying m.d. or s.d. [PIN+] variants of similar [PSI+] induction strength (scored as high for both) on a 1.5% agarose gel (SDD-AGE) where both higher molecular complexes and monomers can be resolved (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although Rnq1p from a [psi–] [pin–] derivative migrated as a monomer, Rnq1p from either the m.d. or high s.d. [PIN+] derivatives was assembled into large structures (Fig. 2A). We refer to these SDS-stable structures as prion subparticles. Interestingly, the size distributions of [PIN+] subparticles were prion variant-specific. Although m.d. [PIN+] subparticles were evenly distributed and had a size range from ∼600 to >3000 kDa, the size of high s.d. [PIN+] subparticles varied from ∼400 to <3000 kDa. After probing the same gel with anti-Sup35p antibodies, we found Sup35p migrated as a monomer, indicating that most of the non-prionized Sup35p does not form stable interactions with subparticles from these [PIN+] variants (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2[PIN+] aggregates are composed of SDS-stable variant-specific subparticles that increase in size upon guanidine treatment. A, [PIN+] subparticles are variant-specific and do not contain Sup35p. A preparation of chicken pectoralis extract (CPE) stained with Coomassie was used as a ladder. Lysates were treated with SDS at room temperature (RT) or at 30 °C, analyzed by SDD-AGE for the presence of Rnq1p (left panel), and then stripped and stained for Sup35p (right panel) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Derivatives of [psi–] 74D-694 harboring [pin–] (–) or m.d. or high s.d. [PIN+] were used. B, guanidine leads to an increase in size of [PIN+] prion subparticles. m.d. [PIN+] and high s.d. [PIN+] derivatives of [psi–] 74D-694 were grown in YPD with (+) or without (–) the addition of 7 mm guanidine HCl (Gu) (see “Experimental Procedures”).

[PIN+] had size distributions similar to each other (but not exactly the same) and to m.d. [PIN+] (Fig. 3B), which had a high [PSI+]-inducing strength.Fig. 3Subparticles from [PIN+] variants differ in size and stability. Lysates of [psi–] 74D-694 derivatives carrying different [PIN+] variants were treated with 2% SDS at room temperature (RT) or at 60 °C and analyzed for the presence of Rnq1p by SDD-AGE.

As expected, incubation of 74D-694 derivatives bearing m.d. or high s.d. [PIN+] variants in the presence of 7 mm guanidine for one generation increased the size distribution of the [PIN+] subparticles (Fig. 2B).Several findings suggest that differences between prion variants are caused by the conformation that the prion molecule acquires (36Tanaka M.

Indeed, although m.d. and s.d. [PIN+] subparticles were equally stable in 2 and 7.5% SDS (not shown) at room temperature and at 30 °C, when subjected to 60 °C their stability differed. Although all s.d. [PIN+] subparticles were stable at 60 °C (Fig. 3A), m.d. [PIN+] subparticles broke down into smaller species migrating as Rnq1p monomers (∼46 kDa) and at ∼200 and ∼400 kDa (Fig. 3B). At 95 °"

We have demonstrated previously that TCL1 (a proto-oncogene underlying human T cell prolymphocytic leukemia) interacts with Akt and functions as an Akt kinase co-activator. With the aim to develop an Akt kinase inhibitor, we hypothesized that a peptide, which spans the Akt-binding site, binds to Akt and modulates Akt kinase activity and its downstream biological responses. Indeed, we demonstrated that a peptide, named “Akt-in” (Akt inhibitor, NH2-AVTDHPDRLWAWEKF-COOH, encompassing the βA strand of human TCL1), interacted with Akt and specifically inhibited its kinase activity. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies suggested that interaction of Akt-in with the pleckstrin homology domain (PH) of Akt caused conformational changes on the variable loop 1 of Akt, the locus mediating phosphoinositide binding. Consistently, interaction of Akt-in with the Akt PH domain prevented phosphoinositide binding and hence inhibited membrane translocation and activation of Akt. Moreover, Akt-in inhibited not only cellular proliferation and anti-apoptosis in vitro but also in vivo tumor growth without any adverse effect. The roles of Akt, which possesses a PH domain, in intracellular signaling were well established. Hence, Akt inhibitors create an attractive target for anticancer therapy. However, no effective inhibitors specific for Akt have been developed. Akt-in, which inhibits association of phosphatidylinositol with Akt, is the first molecule to demonstrate specific Akt kinase inhibition potency.

Three highly homologous Akt isoforms (Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3) exist in mammals. Akt is composed of three functionally distinct regions: an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a central catalytic domain, and a C-terminal hydrophobic region. The PH domain is a small 100–120-residue module found in many proteins involved in cell signaling or cytoskeletal rearrangement. The PH domain of Akt is similar to other proteins, and it consists of seven β strands forming two orthogonal antiparallel β-sheets that are closed with the C-terminal α-helix (5Auguin D. Barthe P.

Activation of Akt is also induced in the mutation of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) tumor suppressor gene. PTEN antagonizes PI3K function by the reduction in the levels of both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2.

Both Akt association and homodimerization of TCL1 are required for the complete function of TCL1 to enhance Akt kinase activity.

With the goal to develop a putative Akt kinase inhibitor, we hypothesized that a peptide, which is spanning the Akt-binding site, binds to Akt and modulates Akt kinase activity along with its downstream biological responses.Based on the binding domain of TCL1 with Akt, we identified and characterized a peptide that encompassed the βA strand of TCL1, interacted with Akt, and inhibited Akt kinase activity. Akt-in prevented PtdIns binding to Akt, and consequently it inhibited membrane translocation of Akt and its downstream biological responses. Given the pivotal role of Akt kinase as a core intracellular survival factor implicated in the molecular mechanisms of human neoplastic diseases, the results could help to design Akt kinase-specific inhibitors for therapeutic approaches.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptide Design—For the Akt-in peptides, the amino acid positions 10–24 of human TCL1, NH2-AVTDHPDRLWAWEKF-COOH are used.

Fifty ng of GST fusion proteins were incubated with 20 μl of immobilized Akt3, PH domain, or C-terminal Akt. The samples were run on SDS gels and immunoblotted with anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences). The results were consistent in at least three independent experiments. GST fusion Akt-in was generated by subcloning with the corresponding nucleotide into pGEX4T-2 vectors (Amersham Biosciences).

Briefly, the immobilized Akt was incubated with 0, 200, or 400 μm of indicated peptides for 2 h, and then an in vitro kinase assay reaction was performed for 4 min at 30 °C. The samples were heat-denatured, separated on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-GSK or anti-Akt (Cell Signaling) using ECL (Amersham Biosciences).PKA Kinase Assay—In vitro PKA kinase assays were performed using Peptag (Promega) as described previously (22Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The indicated concentrations of peptides (Akt-in or TAT-FLAG control peptide) were incubated with 25 ng of PKA with 100 ng of bovine serum albumin for 1 h in the presence or absence of 2 μm PKA inhibitor (Calbiochem catalog number 116805), followed by the kinase reaction for 20 min at 26 °C, and then separated on 0.8% TBE-agarose gel.In Vitro PDK1 Kinase Assay—Purified baculovirus-derived recombinant His-PDK-1-WT (1.0 μg/reaction (22Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar)) was incubated with or without the indicated concentrations of peptides (Akt-in or TAT-FLAG) in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm cold ATP, and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 30 °C. The reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie staining followed by autoradiography (shown in Fig. 3D).Phosphorylation of Akt, BAD, FKHR, or p44/42 MAP Kinase in 293 Cells—293 cells (ATCC) were cultured in a 60-mm dish and transfected (or nontransfected in Fig. 3B) with 5 μg of m-BAD (Fig. 3C, pEBGmBad, Cell Signaling) using calcium phosphate transfection as described previously (22Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, the cells were serum-starved (0.2% fetal bovine serum) and treated with either control (TAT-FLAG) or Akt-in (TAT-Akt-in) at 50 μm for additional 12 h. The cells were stimulated with or without 20 ng/ml PDGF for 8 (in Fig. 3C) or 5 min (in Fig. 3B) and lysed with Brij lysis buffer in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (22Laine J. Kunstle G. Obata T. Sha M. Noguchi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 395-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and the resultant samples were resolved on 4–20% SDS gel (Kyoto Daiichi Kagaku Co., Ltd.). They were then immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling (Akt, 9272, phospho-Ser-473 Akt 9271, phospho-Ser-308 Akt 9275, Ser-256 FKHR 9461, FKHR 9462, phospho-Ser-136 BAD 9295, BAD 9292, anti-p44/42 MAP kinase 9102, anti-phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase 9106, anti-38 MAP kinase 9212, and phospho-p38 MAP kinase antibody 9216), and detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).NMR Experiment—NMR spectra were recorded on 0.25–0.3-ml (Shigemi tubes pre-coated with a silicon solution (Sigma)) samples of 0.05 mm15N-labeled Akt2-PH dissolved in the conditioning buffer (10 mm Tris/H2O (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm EDTA, with 5–10% 2H2O for the lock), in the presence or absence of 20 mmAkt-in. NMR experiments were carried out at 10 °C on a Bruker AVANCE 600 spectrometer equipped with 5-mm z-shielded gradient 1H-13C-15N triple resonance cryogenic probe. 1H chemical shifts were directly referenced to the resonance of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt, and 15N chemical shifts were indirectly referenced with the absolute frequency ratios (15N/1H) = 0.101329118. In all experiments, the 1H carrier was centered on the water resonance, and a WATERGATE sequence was incorporated to suppress the solvent resonance. All NMR spectra were acquired in the phase-sensitive mode with Digital Quadrature Detection in the F2 dimension and hypercomplex States-TPPI method in F1 dimension and processed using Gifa (version 4.22) software. 1H,15N-HSQC spectra were recorded using a time domain data size of 64 t1 × 1K t2 complex points and 32 transients per complex t1 increment.PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 Lipid-Protein Pull-down Assay—A lipid-protein pull-down assay was performed using PIP Beads (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, Echelon Bioscience Inc.). Indicated peptides (Akt-in or βC control) were incubated with 50 ng of Akt kinase (unactivated, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., catalog number 14-279) with 400 ng/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 h with gentle agitation at 4 °C. TAT-FLAG control was added to adjust the final peptide concentration to be equal throughout the samples. 25 μl of PIP Beads were then added to each sample and incubated for an additional 16 h. The reactions were then washed four times with washing buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 140 mm NaCl), resolved on SDS gel, and immunoblotted by ECL (Amersham Biosciences).Membrane Translocation Experiment—293 cells (ATCC) were grown on a poly-l-lysine-coated cover glass and were transfected with 1 μg of HA-Akt1 or Akt-PH-GFP or Btk (Bruton tyrosine kinase)-PH-GFP in a mammalian expression vector (39Varnai P. Rother K.I. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10983-10989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Six hours after the transfection, 50 μmAkt-in or TAT-FLAG control was added and incubated for 16 h. The cells were then serum-starved (0.5%) and then incubated for an additional 24 h. The cells were treated with or without 50 nm wortmannin for 20 min, stimulated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-AB (Sigma, 3226) for 10 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 10 ng/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-HA antibody (12CA5, MBL) or phospho-Ser-473 antibody (587F11, Cell Signaling), and examined using a confocal microscope (Nikon).Proliferation Assay—Cell growth was assessed by a colorimetric method using WST-8 regent (2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt) (347-07621, Dojin) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2000 T4 cells were seeded into each well of 96-well plate. The peptides (TAT-βC or TAT-Akt-in) were added at the indicated concentrations. Three days later, WST-8 regent was added and incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 °C, and the absorbance was determined using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad).Cell Death Assay and Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Assay—T4 cells (human T cell leukemia cells) were treated with the indicated concentrations of peptide (TAT-FLAG control or TAT-Akt-in) for 24 h. The cells were transfected with either myr-Akt (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., catalog number 17-253) or a control. Cell death was assessed by staining with 2 μg/ml propidium iodide. Mitochondrial permeability transition was verified by staining with rhodamine 123 (Molecular Probe) at 5 μm for 15 min at 37 °C (26Künstle G. Laine J. Pierron G. Kagami S. Nakajima H. Hoh F.

Hosokawa M. Hamada J.I. Hasegawa J. Kato M. Mizutani M. Ren J. Takeichi N. Kobayashi H. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Two micromoles of the indicated peptides (TAT-Akt-in, TAT-FLAG, or phosphate-buffered saline) per mouse were injected directly into the tumor on days 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, and 19. In vivo cell growth was calculated based on the diameter of the tumor. On day 9 after transplantation, the tumors were resected, fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E), TUNEL (terminal dUTP nick-end labeling, MK500, Takara Shuzo), or phospho-Akt (Ser-473) monoclonal antibody (587F11, Cell Signaling).RESULTSPeptide Design of Akt-in and the Structure of TCL1—TCL1 forms a closed symmetrical β-barrel structure, consisting of eight antiparallel β strands (41Hoh F.

https://openalex.org/W2009134294,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is known to function in cell survival in response to various stresses; however, the mechanism of cell survival by ERK1/2 remains poorly elucidated in ischemic heart. Here we applied functional proteomics by two-dimensional electrophoresis to identify a cellular target of ERK1/2 in response to ischemic hypoxia. Approximately 1500 spots were detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of a sample from unstimulated cells. The staining intensities of at least 50 spots increased at 6-h reoxygenation after 2-h ischemic hypoxia. Of the 50 spots that increased, at least 4 spots were inhibited in the presence of PD98059, a MEK inhibitor. A protein with a molecular mass of 52 kDa that is strongly induced by ERK1/2 activation in response to ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation was identified as α-enolase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and amino acid sequencing. The expressions of the α-enolase mRNA and protein are inhibited during reoxygenation after ischemic hypoxia in the cells containing a dominant negative mutant of MEK1 and treated with a MEK inhibitor, PD98059, leading to a decrease in ATP levels. α-Enolase expression is also observed in rat heart subjected to ischemia-reperfusion. The induction of α-enolase by ERK1/2 appears to be mediated by c-Myc. The introduction of the α-enolase protein into the cells restores ATP levels and prevents cell death during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation in these cells. These results show that α-enolase expression by ERK1/2 participates in the production of ATP during reoxygenation after ischemic hypoxia, and a decrease in ATP induces apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, α-enolase improves the contractility of cardiomyocytes impaired by ischemic hypoxia. Our results reveal that ERK1/2 plays a role in the contractility of cardiomyocytes and cell survival through α-enolase expression during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation."
https://openalex.org/W1980358379,"Pantothenate is the precursor of the essential cofactor coenzyme A (CoA). Pantothenate kinase (CoaA) catalyzes the first and regulatory step in the CoA biosynthetic pathway. The pantothenate analogs N-pentylpantothenamide and N-heptylpantothenamide possess antibiotic activity against Escherichia coli. Both compounds are substrates for E. coli CoaA and competitively inhibit the phosphorylation of pantothenate. The phosphorylated pantothenamides are further converted to CoA analogs, which were previously predicted to act as inhibitors of CoA-dependent enzymes. Here we show that the mechanism for the toxicity of the pantothenamides is due to the inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis through the formation and accumulation of the inactive acyl carrier protein (ACP), which was easily observed as a faster migrating protein using conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis. E. coli treated with the pantothenamides lost the ability to incorporate [1-14C]acetate to its membrane lipids, indicative of the inhibition of fatty acid synthesis. Cellular CoA was maintained at the level sufficient for bacterial protein synthesis. Electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry confirmed that the inactive ACP was the product of the transfer of the inactive phosphopantothenamide moiety of the CoA analog to apo-ACP, forming the ACP analog that lacks the sulfhydryl group for the attachment of acyl chains for fatty acid synthesis. Inactive ACP accumulated in pantothenamide-treated cells because of the active hydrolysis of regular ACP and the slow turnover of the inactive prosthetic group.

Thus, the pantothenamides are pro-antibiotics that inhibit fatty acid synthesis and bacterial growth because of the covalent modification of ACP.

American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 687-694Google Scholar). All of the genes and enzymes involved in the CoA biosynthetic pathway have been identified in Escherichia coli (Fig. 1). The first step in the pathway is catalyzed by the key rate-controlling pantothenate kinase (CoaA) 1The abbreviations used are: CoaA, pantothenate kinase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; AcpH, [ACP]hydrolase; AcpS, [ACP]synthase; CoaD, 4′-phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase; CoaE, dephospho-CoA kinase; ESI, electrospray ionization; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; MS, mass spectrometry; N5-Pan, N-pentylpantothenamide; N7-Pan, N-heptylpantothenamide; PanF, pantothenate permease; TOF, time-of-flight.1The abbreviations used are: CoaA, pantothenate kinase; ACP, acyl carrier protein; AcpH, [ACP]hydrolase; AcpS, [ACP]synthase; CoaD, 4′-phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase; CoaE, dephospho-CoA kinase; ESI, electrospray ionization; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; MS, mass spectrometry; N5-Pan, N-pentylpantothenamide; N7-Pan, N-heptylpantothenamide; PanF, pantothenate permease; TOF, time-of-flight.

These two steps are carried out by a bifunctional polypeptide, phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase decarboxylase (denoted CoaBC, formally Dfp) (2Strauss E. Kinsland C. Ge Y. McLafferty F.W.

The last two steps are carried out by two separate enzymes, namely phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase (CoaD) (3Geerlof A. Lewendon A. Shaw W.V. J. Biol.

The phosphopantetheine moiety of CoA is transferred to serine 36 of apo-ACP by [ACP]synthase (AcpS) (9Polacco M.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol.

The initial report identifying the [ACP]hydrolase gene is incorrect (11Fischl A.S. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5445-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nakanishi M. Yatome C. Ishida N. Kitade Y. J. Biol.

Nonetheless, ACP prosthetic group turnover is very rapid in vivo, with turnover proceeding at a rate 4 times faster than the rate of new ACP synthesis (13Powell G.L. Elovson J. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 211: 5610-5624Google Scholar, 14Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1891-1895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The pantothenamides are a class of pantothenate analogs, exemplified by the N-pentylpantothenamide (N5-Pan) and N-heptylpantothenamide (N7-Pan) (Fig. 1), that inhibit E. coli growth (15Clifton G. Bryant S.R. Skinner C.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 137: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These pantothenamides are substrates for CoaA, and the phosphorylated derivatives are used as substrates by CoaD and CoaE to produce the CoA analogs ethyldethia-CoA and butyldethia-CoA (16Strauss E. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48205-48209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The rate of conversion of N5-Pan to the CoA analog is more rapid than the conversion of pantothenate to CoA. This discovery led to the conclusion that the mechanism for the toxicity of N5-Pan is due to its biosynthetic conversion to the CoA analog ethyldethia-CoA, which acts as an inhibitor of CoA-utilizing and acetyl-CoA-utilizing enzymes (16Strauss E. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48205-48209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We have examined the metabolism of pantothenamide antimetabolites, specifically N5-Pan and N7-Pan, in further detail and conclude that their biological effects are exerted through the transfer of the inactive 4′-phosphopantothenamide moiety from the CoA analogs to ACP, resulting in the accumulation of inactive ACPs and the cessation of fatty acid synthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Strains—Amersham Biosciences supplied [1-14C]acetate (specific activity, 54 μCi/μmol). The l-[3H]amino acid mixture (specific activity, 30–60 Ci/mmol) and β-[3-3H]alanine (specific activity, 50 Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. An ECF Western blotting kit was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The E. coli strains used for minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination were as follows: UB1005 (metB1, relA1, spoT1, λR, λ–, gyrA216,F–); ANS1 (tolC::Tn10, metB1, relA1, spoT1, λR, λ–, gyrA216, F–), a derivative of strain UB1005 that is defective in TolC-dependent type I secretion and efflux pumps (17Buchanan S.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 3-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); and DV1 (panF11, panD2, zad220::Tn10, metB1, relA1, spoT1, λR, λ–, gyrA216, F–), a β-alanine auxotroph that is also defective in pantothenate uptake (6Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 136-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain SJ16 (panD2, zad220::Tn10, metB1, relA1, spoT1, λR, λ–, gyrA216, F–) is a β-alanine auxotroph (18Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 926-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was used in the CoA labeling experiment.Synthesis of the Pantothenamides—The synthetic procedures were adapted from the procedure of Strauss and Begley (16Strauss E. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48205-48209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Sodium pantothenate (4.5 g, 18.6 mmol) was dissolved in 20 ml of methanol and passed through an Amberlite IR-120 (H+) ion exchange column. The column was subsequently eluted with 200 ml of methanol until neutral. The elution solvent was then removed under high heat and vacuum on a rotary evaporator to complete dryness. The resulting free acid obtained in this procedure (4 g, 18.2 mmol) was a viscous, straw-colored oil, which was then redissolved in 10 ml of dry dimethylformamide. The 10-ml solution was split into two 5-ml fractions and placed into 100-ml reaction vessels. To each solution an additional 10 ml of dry dimethylformamide was added. For the synthesis of N5-Pan, amylamine (1.16 ml, 10 mmol) and diphenylphosphoryl azide (2.24 ml, 10 mmol) were added to the first pantothenate solution. For the synthesis of N7-Pan, heptylamine (1.48 ml, 10 mmol) and diphenylphosphoryl azide (2.24 ml, 10 mmol) were added to the second pantothenate solution. The reaction mixtures were then cooled to 0 °C, and triethylamine (1.39 ml, 10 mmol) was added to each. The reactions were stirred at 0 °C for 2 h, followed by stirring at room temperature overnight. The reaction volumes were reduced by rotary evaporation under high vacuum to remove dimethylformamide. Each of the products was then purified by flash column chromatography on a silica gel first with 100% ethyl acetate followed by a linear gradient of 100:0 to 95:5 chloroform/methanol. The fractions containing each of the products were collected and concentrated in vacuo, yielding both products as white powders (1.6 g with 60% yield and 2.1 g with 71% yield, respectively).Determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations—The MICs of the pantothenamides against the E. coli strains were determined by a broth microdilution method. Bacterial culture was grown to mid-log phase in 1% tryptone broth before being diluted 30,000-fold in the same medium. A 10-μl aliquot of the diluted cell suspension (3,000–5,000 colony forming units) was used to inoculate each well of a 96-well plate (U-bottom with low evaporation lid) containing 100 μl of tryptone broth with the indicated concentration of inhibitors. To study the effect of pantothenate on the MICs, the tryptone broth was supplemented with 100 μm pantothenate. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 20 h before being read by a Fusion™ universal microplate analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.) at 600 nm. The growth of cells treated with an equal volume of the solvent vehicle was considered as 100%.[1-14C]Acetate Labeling of Membrane Lipids—Strain ANS1 was grown to early log phase (20 Klett units) in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.1% casamino acids, 0.4% glycerol, and 0.0005% thiamin. N5-Pan was added to the growing cells to a final concentration of 100 μm. Cerulenin, a known fatty acid synthesis inhibitor, was included as a positive control at 25 μg/ml. An equal volume of the solvent Me2SO was added to the untreated control. At different time points after N5-Pan was added, a 1-ml aliquot of cells was taken out and labeled with 10 μCi of [1-14C]acetate (specific activity, 54 μCi/μmol) for 15 min before being harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 100 μl of M9. The total cellular lipids were extracted with chloroform-methanol (19Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42178) Google Scholar), and the incorporated 14C-isotope in lipids in the chloroform phase was quantitated by scintillation counting. To test whether N5-Pan interferes with the protein synthesis in E. coli, we labeled strain ANS1 cells with 1 μCi of the l-[3H]amino acid mixture (specific activity, 30–60 Ci/mmol). Aliquots of 1-ml cell suspension treated with 100 μm N5-Pan for 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 h (labeled with the l-[3H]amino acid mixture for 15 min) were collected on Millipore HA 0.45 μm filters. The filters were washed with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to scintillation vials with 3 ml of scintillation fluid to count the incorporated 3H-isotope. Tetracycline (200 μm), a known protein synthesis inhibitor, and Me2SO were included as controls.β-[3-3H]Alanine Labeling of CoA in N5-Pan-treated Cells—Strain SJ16 was grown on M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.5 μm β-[3-3H]alanine, 0.1% casamino acids, 0.4% glycerol, and 0.0005% thiamin to early log phase (20 Klett units). N5-Pan was added to the growing cells to a final concentration of 10 μm. One-milliliter aliquots of cells were removed at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after the addition of N5-Pan. Cells were harvested with centrifugation and lysed with lysozyme and Triton X-100 (100 μl). CoA and ACP in 10 μl of the cell lysate were separated on a pre-activated silica gel H thin layer plate (Analtech), which was developed in butanol/acetic acid/H2O at 5:2:4 (v/v/v). The 3H-labeled CoA and pathway intermediates were detected using an AR-2000 TLC Imaging Scanner (BIOSCAN).Effects of Exogenous Fatty Acids on the MIC of N5-Pan for Streptococcus pneumoniae R6—The MIC of N5-Pan for S. pneumoniae strain R6 was determined using the microdilution method described above, and a defined semisynthetic medium (C+Y medium) (20Lacks S. Hotchkiss R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 39: 508-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) was used to replace the tryptone broth. To test whether fatty acid can reverse the inhibition of N5-Pan, the C+Y growth medium was supplemented with 0.1% oleate, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was added as a carrier of the fatty acid. The same amount of bovine serum albumin was added to the controls lacking fatty acids.Conformationally Sensitive Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot of ACP—Strain ANS1 was grown on M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.1% casamino acids, 0.4% glycerol, and 0.0005% thiamin to early log phase (20 Klett units). N5-Pan or N7-Pan was added to the growing cells to a final concentration of 4× their MIC concentrations (100 μm for N5-Pan; 50 μm for N7-Pan), and cells were harvested by centrifugation at the end of 3 h after the addition of pantothenamide. Control cells were treated with an equal volume of the solvent vehicle Me2SO. Cells were then lysed with lysozyme and Triton X-100, and the lysates were centrifuged to get rid of cellular debris. The cell-free lysates of the N5-Pan treated cells, the N7-Pan treated cells, and the control cells were loaded onto a 13% acrylamide gel containing 0.5 m urea, and gel electrophoresis was performed under non-denaturing conditions. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the ACP was detected by immunoblotting using the ECF detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The ACP-specific antibody (21Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15186-15191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used at 1:500 dilution as the primary antibody, and the anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase was used as the secondary antibody at 1:2500 dilution. The blot was developed using the ECF detection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the fluorescent signal was detected using a Typhoon 9200.Purification of ACP—Strain ANS1 was grown on M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.1% casamino acids, 0.4% glycerol, and 0.0005% thiamin. N5-Pan was added to the early log phase culture to 100 μm, and the cells were incubated for 3 h in the presence of N5-Pan. Control cells were given the same amount of Me2SO solvent vehicle. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at the end of the incubation and lysed with a French press at 20,000 p.s.i. The cell-free extract was obtained by ultra-centrifugation of 200,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. ACP was purified from the cell-free extract with an anion exchange DE52 column followed by gel filtration. Briefly, the cell-free extract was loaded on a DE52 column equilibrated in 10 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.5). After the column was washed with 10 column volumes of 10 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.5) and 10 column volumes of the same buffer containing 0.15 m LiCl, ACP was eluted with 10 mm Bis-Tris (pH 6.5) containing 0.45 m LiCl. The fractions with the ACP were pooled and concentrated before being loaded onto a Superdex 75 gel filtration column that was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The fractions with the purified ACP were pooled and concentrated.Mass Spectrometry of ACP—The intact protein mass determination of ACP purified from N5-Pan-treated and control cells was performed by the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Approximately 200 pmol of the purified ACP was diluted to 50 μl with 10 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8. The protein was loaded on a weak anion exchange nano-extraction cartridge (Western Analytical, Murrieta, CA) and washed extensively with water at pH 8 (pH was adjusted with 12.5% ammonium hydroxide) to remove the bound salts. The protein was eluted from the column with 30 μl of 70% acetonitrile with 5% formic acid and then diluted with 5% formic acid to a final acetonitrile concentration of 50%. Mass measurements were performed using a Micromass LCT ESI-TOF spectrometer (Micromass Inc., Beverly, MA) equipped with a Z-spray electrospray interface (Micromass Inc.). A flow rate of 200 nl/min was maintained using a VLP200 syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and the desalted protein was introduced by direct injection. Data were collected for an m/z range of 500–2500 at a cone voltage of +35 V and a manual pusher time of 70 μs. All other instrument settings were those typically used for protein measurements on this instrument. Deconvolution of the protein spectrum was accomplished using the maximum entropy algorithm of the MassLynx software (Micromass Inc.) (22Ferrige A.G. Seddon M.J. Green B.N. Jarvis S.A. Skilling J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 6: 707-711Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar).ACP Turnover in N5-Pan-treated Cells—Strain ANS1 was grown on M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.1% casamino acids, 0.4% glycerol, and 0.0005% thiamin to early log phase (20 Klett units). N5-Pan was added to the growing cells to a final concentration of 100 μm. After 2, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min of N5-Pan addition, 5-ml aliquots of the cell suspension were removed and harvested by centrifugation. The remaining cells were collected on a Millipore HA 0.45 μm filter on a vacuum manifold and washed with pre-warmed M9 medium to remove N5-Pan. The cells were then resuspended and diluted to 20 Klett units in pre-warmed M9 medium followed by 4 h of incubation at 37 °C. During the 4-h incubation, 5-ml aliquots of cell suspension were removed and harvested by centrifugation at the following time points: 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 min. The cell pellets were lysed with lysozyme and Triton X-100 (200 μl). Proteins in 10 μl of cell free lysates were separated by electrophoresis on a 13% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 m urea under non-denaturing conditions (23Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Armitage I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2669-2674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ACP was detected by immunoblotting as described above.RESULTSAntibacterial Activity of the Pantothenamides—The antimicrobial activity of the pantothenamides was tested against E. coli strain ANS1, which is defective in TolC-dependent efflux. N5-Pan and N7-Pan inhibited the growth of strain ANS1 with MIC values of 25 and 12 μm, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). We and others have shown previously that N5-Pan and N7-Pan are both substrates and inhibitors of E. coli pantothenate kinase CoaA (16Strauss E. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48205-48209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Ivey R.A. Zhang Y.-M. Virga K.G. Hevener K. Lee R.E. Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Park H.-W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35622-35629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, we added pantothenate to the growth medium to test whether it would attenuate the inhibitory effect of the compounds on bacterial growth. Supplementing the growth medium with 100 μm pantothenate increased the MIC values only by 2-fold for both compounds (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, overexpression of the E. coli coaA gene on a multi-copy vector failed to rescue the cells from the inhibitory effects of N5-Pan and N7-Pan (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating that cell growth inhibition was not due to the competitive inhibition of the phosphorylation of pantothenate and that CoaA was not the target of the antimicrobial action of the pantothenate antimetabolites.Fig. 2The antibacterial activity of the pantothenamides against E. coli. A, N5-Pan inhibited the growth of E. coli strain ANS1 (▪) with an MIC value of 25 μm. The addition of 100 μm pantothenate to the medium increased the MIC by 2-fold (□). Overexpression of the coaA gene on a multi-copy vector did not change the MIC (•). B, N7-Pan inhibited strain ANS1 with an MIC value of 12 μm (▪). Similarly to N5-Pan, the addition of 100 μm pantothenate increased the MIC value by 2-fold (□), and overexpression of the coaA gene did not rescue the cells (•). C, transport of the pantothenamides in E. coli. N5-Pan inhibited strains UB1005 (tolC+, panF+; ○), ANS1 (tolC, panel A), and DV1 (panF, •) with the same MIC value of 25 μm, indicating that the transport of N5-Pan is independent of both the TolC-dependent efflux pumps and the PanF permease. tolC+ wild-type strains UB1005 (□) and DV1 (▪) were much more resistant to N7-Pan inhibition as compared with strain ANS1. Thus, N7-Pan can be transported out by the TolC-dependent efflux pumps, and the uptake of N7-Pan is independent of the PanF transporter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Transport of the Pantothenamides—TolC is an outer membrane protein that is involved in the type I secretion of proteins and efflux of small molecules and toxic compounds (17Buchanan S.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 3-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). N5-Pan inhibited UB1005, the tolC+ wild-type parent of E. coli strain ANS1, with an MIC of 25 μm, which is similar to that of the TolC-defective strain ANS1 (Fig. 2, A and C), suggesting that the cell permeability of N5-Pan is independent of TolC. For this reason, the later metabolic experiments were performed using N5-Pan. In contrast, wild-type strain UB1005 was much more resistant to N7-Pan than strain ANS1. The MIC of N7-Pan against strain UB1005 was > 200 μm, much higher than that of strain ANS1 (Fig. 2, B and C), demonstrating that N7-Pan is a substrate for a TolC-dependent efflux pump(s). The pantothenate permease (PanF) of E. coli catalyzes the concentrative uptake of pantothenate by a sodium ion cotransport mechanism (6Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 136-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 162: 1156-1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Jackowski S. Alix J.-H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3842-3848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain DV1 is defective in PanF and has lost the ability to utilize extracellular pantothenate for growth (6Vallari D.S. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 136-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the uptake of the pantothenamides was through the PanF permease, the MIC values of the compounds for strain DV1 were obtained and compared with the panF+ wild-type strain UB1005. The MIC values of both compounds for strain DV1 were the same as those for strain UB1005 (Fig. 2C), indicating that the uptake of the pantothenamides was independent of the PanF transport system.Formation of Faster Migrating ACPs in Cells Treated with the Pantothenamides—Strauss and Begley showed that N5-Pan was converted to a CoA analog by the enzymes in the CoA biosynthetic pathway and that the analog intermediates were better substrates for CoaD and CoaE in vitro (16Strauss E. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48205-48209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). They concluded that the favorable conversion of N5-Pan to the CoA analog could account for its antibacterial activity by competing with CoA and acetyl-CoA for enzymes that utilize these cofactors. To test whether the CoA analogs were used by AcpS to modify ACP, we studied the effects of the pantothenamides on the ACP. Strain ANS1 was grown to early log phase, and either 100 μm N5-Pan, 50 μm N7-Pan, or Me2SO was added to the separate cultures (Fig. 3A). The growth curves showed that there was no difference in the replication rate among the three conditions during the first two doubling periods after the addition of the inhibitors (Fig. 3A). Only after 1.5 h of incubation in the presence of the inhibitors did cell replication start to slow down in the cultures with the pantothenamides, and the N7-Pan-treated cells stopped growing altogether at the end of the 3 h of incubation. The delayed toxicity of the pantothenamides suggested that the mechanism of the antibacterial activity required their incorporation into a cellular component rather than the direct inhibition of an essential enzyme for bacterial growth.Fig. 3Formation and intact mass determination of fast migrating ACPs in pantothenamide-treated E. coli. A, strain ANS1 was grown to early log phase (20 Klett units) when 100 μm N5-Pan (•), 50 μm N7-Pan (▪), or an equal volume of Me2SO (DMSO; ○) was added to the medium. The arrow in the graph indicates when the drug was added. After 3 h of incubation in the presence of the inhibitors, cells were lysed, and proteins in the cell-free extracts were separated by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” ACP was detected by immunoblotting with the anti-ACP primary antibody. B, we purified ACP from strain ANS1 and determined its intact mass using ESI-TOF MS. The experimental mass of ACP was 8848.94 Da, which was consistent with the calculated mass (8848.70 Da). C, N5-ACP was purified from strain ANS1 treated with 100 μm N5-Pan for 3 h. The mass of N5-ACP determined by ESI-TOF MS was 8858.91 Da, which was consistent with the calculated mass (8858.70 Da).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)ACP and its thioesters can be separated at alkaline pH on a polyacrylamide gel containing a low concentration of urea (25Heath R.J.

https://openalex.org/W1973352749,"Transmembrane ion transport processes play a key role in the adaptation of cells to hyperosmotic conditions. Previous work has shown that the disruption of a ktrB/ntpJ-like putative Na+/K+ transporter gene in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 confers increased Na+ sensitivity, and inhibits HCO3− uptake. Here, we report on the mechanistic basis of this effect. Heterologous expression experiments in Escherichia coli show that three Synechocystis genes are required for K+ transport activity. They encode an NAD+-binding peripheral membrane protein (ktrA; sll0493), an integral membrane protein, belonging to a superfamily of K+ transporters (ktrB; formerly ntpJ; slr1509), and a novel type of ktr gene product, not previously found in Ktr systems (ktrE; slr1508). In E. coli, Synechocystis KtrABE-mediated K+ uptake occurred with a moderately high affinity (Km of about 60 μm), and depended on both Na+ and a high membrane potential, but not on ATP. KtrABE neither mediated Na+ uptake nor Na+ efflux. In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, KtrB-mediated K+ uptake required Na+ and was inhibited by protonophore. A ΔktrB strain was sensitive to long term hyperosmotic stress elicited by either NaCl or sorbitol. Hyperosmotic shock led initially to loss of net K+ from the cells. The ΔktrB cells shocked with sorbitol failed to reaccumulate K+ up to its original level. These data indicate that in strain PCC 6803 K+ uptake via KtrABE plays a crucial role in the early phase of cell turgor regulation after hyperosmotic shock.

Hyperosmolality caused by high salinity or drought constitutes a major challenge to the growth of prokaryotes, fungi, and plants (1Bray E.A.

Many bacteria, including Escherichia coli, react to such a change to hyperosmotic conditions with a biphasic response. During the first phase, E. coli cells accumulate additional K+ from the medium through their K+ uptake systems Trk and Kdp and synthesize glutamate concomitantly. Thereby, they increase the ion content of their cytoplasm and counteract plasmolysis brought about by water efflux because of the reversal of the sign of cell turgor pressure caused by external hyperosmolarity. During its second phase of the cellular adaptation, E. coli replaces this internal potassium glutamate by synthesizing high amounts of the non-ionic compatible solute trehalose (6Dinnbier U. Limpinsel E. Schmid R. Bakker E.P. Arch. Microbiol. 1988; 150: 348-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 7Record Jr., M.T. Courtenay E.S. Cayley D.S. Guttman H.J. Trends Biochem.

Bacillus subtilis follows a slightly different strategy in that after hyperosmotic shock, growing cells of this organism synthesize the compatible zwitterionic solute proline instead of trehalose (9Whatmore A.M.

J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1289-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Other bacteria follow similar approaches (3Bremer E. Krämer R. Storz G. Hengge-Aronis R. Bacterial Stress Responses.

Cyanobacteria can adapt to high NaCl concentrations. Under these conditions a variety of these species synthesize high concentrations of glucosylglycerol and sucrose, which are accumulated as compatible solutes in their cytoplasm (15Reed R.H. Stewart W.D.P. Mar. Biol. (Berlin). 1985; 88: 1-9Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). During the early phase of this adaptation Synechocystis sp. PCC 6714 accumulates Na+. Within a few minutes, Na+ is replaced by K+. Subsequently, it takes many hours to days to replace the high K+ concentration in the cytoplasm by glucosylglycerol as well as minor amounts of sucrose (16Reed R.H. Warr S.R.C. Richardson D.L. Moore D.J. Stewart W.D.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1985; 28: 225-229Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The K+ uptake system(s) involved in the early phases of this osmoadaptation have, however, not been identified in this early work. Since the elucidation of its genome nucleotide sequence, cyanobacterial research has focused on Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (//www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/). During its long term adaptation to high NaCl concentrations, this organism also synthesizes and accumulates glucosylgylcerol (17Marin K. Zuther E. Kerstan T. Kunert A. Hagemann M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4843-4849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Marin K. Huckauf J. Fulda S. Hagemann M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2870-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19Ferjani A. Mustardy L. Sulpice R. Marin K. Suzuki I. Hagemann M. Murata N. Plant Physiol. 2003; 131: 1628-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Determining from the genome sequence, strain PCC 6803 has been predicted to contain at least three types of K+ uptake systems, Kdp system, which is probably of minor importance (20Berry S. Esper B. Karandashova I. Teuber M. Elanskaya I. Rogner M. Hagemann M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a Ktr system (21Nakamura T. Yuda R. Unemoto T. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3491-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which appears to play a role in salt stress by high NaCl concentrations (20Berry S. Esper B. Karandashova I. Teuber M. Elanskaya I. Rogner M. Hagemann M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and K+ channels. However, the Ktr system has not been characterized any further. Recently, it has been reported that in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 the ntpJ gene (slr1509) is essential for both the adaptation to high NaCl concentrations and the bicarbonate transport via the SbtA system (22Shibata M. Katoh H. Sonoda M. Ohkawa H.

SbtA-mediated bicarbonate transport was also dependent on the presence of external Na+ (22Shibata M. Katoh H. Sonoda M. Ohkawa H. Shimoyama M. Fukuzawa H. Kaplan A. Ogawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18658-18664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Since ntpJ has been described originally as the Na+ transport gene J, located downstream of a cluster of ntp genes encoding the Na+-translocating V-type ATPase from Enterococcus hirae (23Takase K.

In particular, the comparison between bacterial KtrB and HKT systems from some plants is important, because Ktr and HKT systems are the only members of the superfamily that mediate Na+-dependent K+ transport. Recently, Berry et al. (20Berry S. Esper B. Karandashova I. Teuber M. Elanskaya I. Rogner M. Hagemann M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) indicates that ntpJ/ktrB from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has a function in K+ uptake. In this report, we confirm and extend their observation with a detailed study on the Ktr system from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We show that NtpJ/KtrB is part of a more complex Ktr system, comprising of three kinds of subunits, KtrA, KtrB, and KtrE. In E. coli K+ transport via the Synechocystis KtrABE system is of moderately high affinity, is dependent on the presence of Na+ and on high membrane potential, but not on ATP. In this bacterium it neither transports Na+ inwards nor outwards. The measurement of the K+ content of the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and the cell containing the mutation at ktrB gene revealed that the Ktr system was essential for the early phase of the adaptation of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 to high osmolality. Growth Conditions—Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and mutant cells were grown at 30 °C in BG11 medium (39Stanier R.Y. Kunisawa R. Mandel M. Cohen-Bazire G. Bacteriol. Rev. 1971; 35: 171-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 20 mm TES-KOH (pH 8.0 and containing 20.44 mm Na+ and 14.77 mm K+, as determined by flame photometry), and bubbled with either 3% CO2 in air (v/v) or air alone. Solid medium contained BG11 buffered at pH 8.0, 1.5% agar, and 0.3% sodium thiosulfate. Continuous illumination was provided by fluorescent lamps (50 μmol of photons m-2 s-1; 400–700 nm). E. coli LB2003 (F-, thi, lacZ, gal, rha, ΔkdpFABC5, trkD1, ΔtrkA), which lacks the three K+ uptake systems, Trk, Kup, and Kdp (13Stumpe S. Schlösser A. Schleyer M. Bakker E.P. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam1996: 473-499Google Scholar), and E. coli TO114 (ΔnhaA, ΔnhaB, ΔchaA), which lacks the three Na+/H+ antiporters, NhaA, NhaB, and ChaA (40Ohyama T. Igarashi K. Kobayashi H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were used as host strains for growth tests to analyze K+ transport and Na+ transport, respectively. For proton motive force tests in E. coli, the strain LF12 (Δ(kdpDE)54, nagA, malT, ΔhemA) was constructed as described by Futatsugi et al. (doctoral thesis, 2001) 1L. Futatsugi and H. Kobayashi, unpublished data. based on the strain TK2642(Δ(kdpDE)54, nagA, malT), a kind gift of Wolf Epstein. Transformants of the E. coli mutant were cultured in a synthetic medium supplemented with the required antibiotics and indicated cations as described previously (27Tholema N. Bakker E.P. Suzuki A. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 40Ohyama T. Igarashi K. Kobayashi H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4311-4315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Uozumi N.

Gene expression was induced by the addition of 0.25 mm IPTG 2The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; CCCP, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; pmf, proton-motive force; ΔΨ, membrane potential; MES, 4-morpholine-ethanesulfonic acid; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-ethyl]glycine. to the medium. Osmolalities were measured using an osmometer (Advanced Osmometer, Advanced Instruments, Norwood, MA). Reintegration of the Synechocystis ktrB Gene into the Strain PCC 6803 Genome—The strain Synechocystis ΔktrB, in which the slr1509 (ktrB) gene has been disrupted by insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene (22Shibata M.

Price G.D. Badger M.R. Ogawa T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2591-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was used to test for rescue of KtrB activity by integration of the gene into its genome. The ktrB gene and spectinomycin resistance gene were tandemly placed under the control of the iron transporter promoter (43Katoh H. Hagino N. Grossman A.R. Ogawa T. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2779-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and inserted into the middle of the kanamycin resistance gene of strain ΔktrB by homologous recombination using the method of Ohkawa et al. (42Ohkawa H. Price G.D. Badger M.R. Ogawa T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2591-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells resistant to spectinomycin (20 μg/ml) were isolated, and the integration of the gene was confirmed by PCR with genomic DNA using the following primers: for ktrB, 5′-CCATTCTACGAACCTAAGT-3′ (primer a) and 5′-CCTTGATATCGTTGTTATT-3′ (primer b); for the kanamycin resistance gene, 5′-ACAGCGGCCGCTTGAACTTTTGCTTTGCC-3′ (primer c) and 5′-ACAGGTACCCACGGTTGATGAGAGCTT-3′ (primer d). This strain was named +ktrB. Plasmid Construction—Synechocystis ktrA (sll0493) was amplified by PCR using the EcoRI site-containing sense primer, 5′-CAGGAATTCAGATGAAAACTAGTCATT-3′, and the PstI site-containing antisense primer, 5′-CATCTGCAGCTAAACTAGGCGGCCG-3′. Subsequently, the PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and PstI and ligated into the corresponding sites of plasmid pSTV28 (TAKARA Co., Japan), giving plasmid pSTV28-KtrA, which was used for ktrA expression in E. coli LB2003. For ktrA expression in E. coli TO114, which is resistant to chloramphenicol, the DraI fragment containing the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pSTV28-KtrA was replaced by the ClaI-Van91I fragment containing the tetracycline resistance gene in pBR322, giving plasmid pSTV28-Tet-KtrA. Strain PCC 6803 DNA, tandemly encoding ktrE (slr1508) and ktrB (slr1509), was amplified by PCR using the XbaI site-containing sense primer, 5′-GAGTCTAGAAGGAATCTGCATGCATATTGCT-3′, and the PstI site-containing antisense primer, 5′-ATTCTGCAGTTAGCCTACCAGCAA-3′. Subsequently the product was digested with XbaI and PstI and ligated into the corresponding sites of plasmid pPAB404 (44Buurman E.T. Kim K.T. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6678-6685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), yielding plasmid pPAB404-KtrBE. The same DNA fragment, except for the deleted start codon ATG of ktrE, was amplified using 5′-GACTCTAGACATATTGCTTGGTTAGGAAAAAAAACGC-3′ as the sense primer (pPAB404-KtrBΔE). Strain PCC 6803 KtrB was amplified by PCR using the XbaI site, containing the sense primer, 5′-GAGTCTAGAAGGAGCTGGAATGACTATTTCC-3′, and the PstI site-containing antisense primer, 5′-ATTCTGCAGTTAGCCTACCAGCAA-3′ and subcloned into plasmid pPAB404, yielding plasmid pPAB404-KtrB. E. coli nhaA was amplified by PCR using the KpnI site containing sense primer, 5′-ATAGGTACCAGGAACTAAAATGAAACATCTGCATCGATT-3′, and the SalI site-containing antisense primer, 5′-AAAGTCGACTCAAACTGATGGACGCAA-3′, and subcloned into plasmid pPAB404, yielding plasmid pPAB404-NhaA. Measurement of K+ Uptake in E. coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803—K+ influx was essentially measured as described by Tholema et al. (27Tholema N. Bakker E.P. Suzuki A. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). E. coli LB2003 cells were cultured in a synthetic medium in the presence of 30 mm KCl, 0.25 mm IPTG, 25 μg/ml of ampicillin, and/or 15 μg/ml of chloramphenicol at 30 °C. E. coli LF12 were cultured in 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.67% KCl, 1% glucose, 0.25 mm IPTG, and the required antibiotics at 30 °C. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was cultured in BG11 medium. The cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 120 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 1 mm EDTA, shaken for 10 min at 37 °C, collected by centrifugation, and washed twice with 200 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) (94 mm Na+ and 29 μm K+, as determined by flame photometry) or 200 mm HEPES-triethanolamine (pH 7.5) (1.9 μm Na+ and 0.36 μm K+), then resuspended in the same buffer. After shaking for 20 min at room temperature, the concentrations of cells were adjusted to an OD578 of 3 with the same buffer. 10 mm glucose was added to the suspension 10 min prior to the start of the K+ uptake measurement. The net uptake of K+ was measured by the silicone filtration technique (21Nakamura T. Yuda R. Unemoto T. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3491-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tholema N.

Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 820-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the K+ contents of the cell pellets being determined by flame photometry (45Bakker E.P. Mangerich W.E. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 147: 820-826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of Na+ Uptake in E. coli—E. coli TO114 was grown in 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.67% KCl, and the required antibiotics. Na+ uptake was measured as described above for K+ uptake. Na+ concentrations in the cells were determined by flame photometry. Measurement of Na Efflux in E. coli—Na+ efflux was measured as described by Sakuma et al. (46Sakuma T. Yamada N. Saito H. Kakegawa T. Kobayashi H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). E. coli TO114 cells were grown in 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast-extract, 0.67% KCl, and the required antibiotics to an OD610 of 0.5, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in the same culture medium containing 150 mm NaCl, then kept on ice for 2 h. Na+ concentrations in the cells were measured as described above for Na+ content. Three Synechocystis ktr Gene Products Are Required for K+ Transport Activity in E. coli—Since previous reports have suggested that Synechocystis KtrB plays a role in K+ uptake (20Berry S. Esper B. Karandashova I. Teuber M. Elanskaya I. Rogner M. Hagemann M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Nakamura T. Yuda R. Unemoto T. Bakker E.P. J.

Ogawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18658-18664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 47Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N.

DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar) (www.kazusa.or.jp/cyano/), we investigated the role of Synechocystis ktr genes in K+ transport and analyzed the Ktr gene family. We cloned the Synechocystis Ktr genes into the E. coli mutant strain LB2003. This strain carries mutations in genes encoding the three major E. coli K+ uptake systems, Kdp, Trk, and Kup. As a consequence, it possesses negligible K+ uptake activity at K+ concentrations in the low millimolar range and, therefore, does not grow at K+ concentrations ≤ 10 mm (13Stumpe S. Schlösser A. Schleyer M. Bakker E.P. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biological Physics. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam1996: 473-499Google Scholar). In agreement with previous results in that only together the cloned ktrA and ktrB genes from V. alginolyticus enable E. coli LB2003 to transport K+ (21Nakamura T. Yuda R. Unemoto T. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3491-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Synechocystis ktrB alone did not restore K+ transport in the strain (Fig. 1). The Synechocystis genome contains a ktrA orthologue (sll0493) at a site quite distant from that of the ktrB (slr1509) gene. However, coexpression of ktrA and ktrB in E. coli LB2003 also did not lead to growth at low K+ concentrations (Fig. 1). The ktrB gene (slr1509) forms a cistron with gene slr1508 (47Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). Coexpression of slr1508 with ktrB and ktrA in E. coli LB2003 resulted in growth at low K+ concentrations (Fig. 1). To exclude the possibility of a polar effect on the expression of ktrB, the initiation codon of slr1508 was removed from the plasmid containing the slr1508-slr1509 cistron, giving plasmid pPAB404-KtrBΔE. Together with the ktrA-containing plasmid, pSTV28-KtrA, it failed to restore growth of the LB2003 strain at low K+ concentrations (Fig. 1). These results showed that three Synechocystis ktr genes, ktrA, ktrB, and slr1508 are essential for K+ transport activity in E. coli. Gene product KtrA is a peripheral membrane protein thought to regulate K+ transport via KtrB by NAD+/NADH binding (21Nakamura T. Yuda R. Unemoto T. Bakker E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3491-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Roosild T.P. Miller S. Booth I.R. Choe S. Cell. 2002; 109: 781-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). KtrB is the K+-translocating subunit discussed above, and slr1508 is a novel type of ktr gene, which we have named ktrE rather than ktrC or ktrD, because in B. subtilis orthologues of its ktrA and ktrB genes have been named ktrC and ktrD (11Holtmann G. Bakker E.P. Uozumi N. Bremer E. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1289-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The subunit of ktrE has not been found in any other Ktr/Trk/HKT/Kdp transporter. Amino acid sequence alignment studies showed sequence similarity between KtrE and glycosyl transferases (Fig. 1D). KtrE is 25 and 23% identical to WbbP of Shigella dysenteriae (49Gohmann S. Manning P.A. Alpert C.A. Walker M.J. Timmis K.N. Microb. Pathog. 1994; 16: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and WbgM of E. coli (50Wang L. Huskic S. Cisterne A. Rothemund D. Reeves P.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2620-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), respectively. Na+ Activates KtrABE-mediated K+ Uptake in E. coli—To further characterize the Ktr system, we examined the ion transport activity of plasmid-containing, K+-depleted E. coli LB2003 cells suspended in 200 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (94 mm Na+ and 29 μm K+, as measured by flame photometry) in the presence of glucose. Addition of 1 mm KCl led to rapid and extensive net K+ uptake only when all three Synechocystis ktrABE were coexpressed in the cells (Fig. 2A), confirming the results of the growth assays (Fig. 1, B and C). The K+ transport activity of both wheat HKT1 and V. alginolyticus KtrAB is enhanced by Na+ (27Tholema N. Bakker E.P. Suzuki A. Nakamura T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Rubio F. Gassmann W. Schroeder J.I. Science. 1995; 270: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). To test whether this was also the case for Synechocystis KtrABE, the LB2003 cells were suspended in low Na+ buffer (200 mm HEPES-triethanolamine buffer; 1.9 μm Na+ and 0.36 μm K+, as measured by flame photometry). Addition of 1 mm KCl to the cells with the empty plasmid led to a small amount of K+ uptake, which was not enhanced by the subsequent addition of 1 mm NaCl (Fig. 2B). Cells expressing ktrABE took up a similar amount of K+ after the addition of the KCl. However, the subsequent addition of NaCl to these cells led to continuous and extensive K+ uptake, indicating that in E. coli K+ uptake via Synechocystis KtrABC depends on the presence of Na+. In addition, the reversal sequence of the addition of 1 mm Na+ and 1 mm K+ showed K+ uptake transport in the cells by addition of 1 mm KCl (Fig. 2C). The stimulatory effect was Na+-specific, since addition of 1 mm LiCl, RbCl, CsCl, or CaCl2 failed to stimulate K+ uptake (Fig. 2D). Because in Fig. 5, we show that KtrABE in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is involved in adaptation to higher osmolalities of both NaCl and sorbitol, we tested the effect of osmolality on the transport process. When either 200 mm sorbitol or 100 mm NaCl (of equal osmolality) was added to the low Na+ buffer (200 mm HEPES-triethanolamine buffer) before the addition of 1 mm KCl, K+ was taken up by cells preincubated with NaCl, but not by those preincubated with sorb"

Spermine is formed from spermidine by the action of spermine synthase, an aminopropyltransferase, whose gene (SpmS) is located on the X chromosome. Deletion of part of the X chromosome that include SpmS in Gy mice leads to a striking phenotype in affected males that includes altered phosphate metabolism and symptoms of hypophosphatemic rickets, circling behavior, hyperactivity, head shaking, inner ear abnormalities, deafness, sterility, a profound postnatal growth retardation, and a propensity to sudden death. It was not clear to what extent these alterations were due to the loss of spermine synthase activity, since this chromosomal deletion extends well beyond the SpmS gene and includes at least one other gene termed Phex. We have bred the Gy carrier female mice with transgenic mice (CAG/SpmS mice) that express spermine synthase from the ubiquitous CAG promoter. The resulting Gy-CAG/SpmS mice had extremely high levels of spermine synthase and contained spermine in all tissues examined. These mice had a normal life span and fertility and a normal growth rate except for a reduction in body weight due to a loss of bone mass that was consistent with the observation that the derangement in phosphate metabolism is due to the loss of the Phex gene and was not restored. These results show that spermine synthesis is needed for normal growth, viability, and fertility in male mice and that regulation of spermine synthase content is not required.

Polyamines are ubiquitous cellular components that play many roles in cellular physiology (1Cohen S.S. A Guide to the Polyamines. Oxford University Press, New York1998Google Scholar). Bacteria such as Escherichia coli can grow without polyamines albeit at a reduced rate (2Hafner E.W. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. J. Biol.

It is possible that this requirement is due to the fact that spermidine is needed as a precursor of hypusine, a post-translational modification of the protein eIF-5A (7Murphey R.J. Gerner W.W. J.

Polyamines clearly have multiple functions in addition to serving as precursors of hypusine, and these may also provide essential functions particularly in higher eukaryotes. Known functions of polyamines include: interactions with DNA and RNA that can modulate chromatin stability and gene expression; direct effects on activity of transcription factors, enzymes, and phospholipid membranes; anti-oxidant effects; and interactions with ion channels (12Wallace H.M. Fraser A.V. Hughes A. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 13Rea G. Bocedi A. Cervelli M.

Rev. Physiol. 1998; 59: 171-191Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Polyamines may also either promote or prevent apoptosis (17Schipper R.G. Penning L.C. Verhofstad A.A.J. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 55-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 18Thomas T. Thomas T.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 244-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). In most cases where polyamine functions unrelated to hypusine have been studied in vitro or in cultured cells, both spermidine and spermine are effective. This raises the question as to why spermine is formed. Aminopropyltransferases are very widely distributed and the basic active site motif has been identified in structural studies (19Korolev S. Ikeguchi Y. Skarina T. Beasley S. Arrowsmith C. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Pegg A.E. Savchenko A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Despite their similarity in this motif, there are two totally distinct aminopropyltransferases in eukaryotes, spermidine synthase and spermine synthase, and there is no overlap in specificity (20Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1986; 234: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar, 21Pegg A.E. Poulin R. Coward J.K. Int. J. Biochem. 1995; 27: 425-442Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Spermine is normally a substantial fraction of the total polyamine pool in such organisms. Although it seems most unlikely that the capacity to synthesize spermine has been so highly conserved without a specific function for spermine, the specific functions of spermine remain elusive, and yeast mutants that lack spermine synthase are viable and grow at a normal rate (22Hamasaki-Katagiri N. Katagiri Y. Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 210: 195-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similarly, cultured mammalian cells that lack spermine due to either the use of inhibitors of spermine synthase or inactivation of the spermine synthase gene (SpmS) are viable and grow normally (23Pegg A.E. Coward J.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 133: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Mackintosh C.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem.

Mackintosh C.A. McCloskey D.E. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 885-892Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the more complex environment of a multicellular organism, it remains possible that spermine is essential due to a requirement in some specialized cell type or to a need for spermine under certain environments. Although one obvious way to examine this question is to specifically inactivate the SpmS gene, it has not yet been possible to obtain knockout mice with such a deletion. Attempts to generate mice that lack spermine synthase by standard gene deletion techniques have not been successful, since on the 129/SvJ background the mice lacking SpmS were not viable (26Korhonen V.-P. Niranen K. Halmekyto M. Pietilä M. Diegelman P. Parkkinen J.J. Eloranta T. Porter C.W. Alhonen L. Janne J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mice lacking spermine synthase have been identified as a result of exposure to mutagens. The male Gyro (Gy) mouse, which is on the B6C3H background, has a chromosomal deletion of part of the X chromosome in the Xp22.1 region, which spans 160–190 kb. This includes most of SpmS and at least one other gene termed Phex (28Meyer Jr., R.A. Henley C.M. Meyer M.H. L. M.P. McDonald A.G. Mills C. Price D.K. Genomics. 1998; 48: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Lorenz B. Francis F. Gempel K. Böddrich A. Josten M. Schmahl W. Schmidt J. Hum. Mol.

The Phex gene product is known to regulate phosphate metabolism in a way in which loss of a single copy is dominant; both male Gy and female XGy mice have symptoms of hypophosphatemia. In addition to this, the male Gy mice have a variety of other phenotypic changes that include inner ear abnormalities, deafness, hyperactivity, circling behavior, sterility, a profound growth retardation, and a propensity to sudden death (Refs. 31Lyon M.F. Scriver C.R. Baker L.R. Tenenhouse H.S. Kronick J. Mandla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4899-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and 32Meyer Jr., R.A. Meyer M.H. Gray R.W. Bruns M.E. J. Orthop. Res. 1995; 13: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and references therein). Gy mice survive only on the B6C3H background; attempts to transfer the gene deletion to other strains have not been successful. There was a complete absence of spermine in tissues of the male Gy mice (24Mackintosh C.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Meyer Jr., R.A. Henley C.M. Meyer M.H. L. M.P. McDonald A.G. Mills C. Price D.K. Genomics. 1998; 48: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Lorenz B. Francis F. Gempel K. Böddrich A. Josten M. Schmahl W. Schmidt J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the absence of spermine may be the cause of some or all of the alterations in male Gy mice described above. To examine this possibility, we have bred the XGy carrier female mice with transgenic male CAG/SpmS mice from lines 8 and 21 (33Ikeguchi Y. Wang X. McCloskey D.E. Coleman C.S. Nelson P. Hu G. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These mice express spermine synthase under the control of a composite cytomegalovirus-immediate early enhancer/chicken β-actin promoter, which was designed to provide ubiquitous expression (34Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar, 35Sawicki J.A. Morris R.J. Monks B. Sakai K. Miyazaki J.-I. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 36Kato M. Yamanouchi K. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Naito K. Tojo H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 54: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Assays of the spermine synthase activity in CAG/SpmS lines 8 and 21 confirmed that there was a high level of expression of the transgene in many different organs and that this was maintained for at least one year (33Ikeguchi Y. Wang X. McCloskey D.E. Coleman C.S. Nelson P. Hu G. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The male Gy-CAG/SpmS mice resulting from crossing these lines with female XGy mice contained spermine (with a slightly higher spermine:spermidine ratio than present in controls), and the normal life span and fertility were restored. They also grew at a normal rate, although their body weight was reduced slightly compared with controls. This reduction is probably due to the hypophosphatemia, which was not affected by the SpmS transgene. These results establish that, in mammals, spermine synthesis is needed for normal viability, growth, and fertility. Materials—All chemicals, unless noted, were purchased from Sigma. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides used as primers were synthesized in the Macromolecular Core Facility, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. The reagents used for PCR genotyping, Taq DNA polymerase, and an Ultrapure dNTP set were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and Amersham Biosciences, respectively.35S-Labeled decarboxylated AdoMet was synthesized from l-[35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (24Mackintosh C.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 37Wiest L. Pegg A.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 79: 51-58Google Scholar). Polyamine and Enzyme Analysis—Polyamine content was determined by HPLC using an ion pair reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography separation method with post-column derivatization using o-phthalaldehyde as described previously (38Pegg A.E. Wechter R. Poulin R. Woster P.M. Coward J.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8446-8453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Spermine synthase assays were carried out by measuring the production of [35S]methylthioadenosine from 35S-labeled decarboxylated AdoMet in the presence of the appropriate amine acceptor as described previously (24Mackintosh C.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 37Wiest L. Pegg A.E. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 79: 51-58Google Scholar). Mice—Heterozygous Gy mice were a kind gift from Dr. R. A. Meyer, Jr. of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, NC. Other Gy mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). XGy carrier females were bred with B6C3H males from The Jackson Laboratory. Female offspring were retained and the heterozygous females carrying the Gy deletion required for breeding identified by phosphate analyses of blood plasma (31Lyon M.F. Scriver C.R. Baker L.R. Tenenhouse H.S. Kronick J. Mandla S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4899-4903Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The Gy males resulting from the breeding of these mice were identified by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from the tails (using the DNeasy tissue kit, Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). The 5′ sense primer used was 5′-GGTGTTGCTGGACCTTCAGA-3′, and the 3′ antisense primer was 5′-CCCAGTACTGTCTTGACTCA-3′. The amplified product at the predicted size of 631 bp was absent in Gy mice and present in controls. A band corresponding to 144 bp, which is the size derived from an inactive pseudogene, was present in both normal and Gy males (24Mackintosh C.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Meyer Jr., R.A. Henley C.M. Meyer M.H. L. M.P. McDonald A.G. Mills C. Price D.K. Genomics. 1998; 48: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The CAG/SpmS mice were generated by DNA microinjection of fertilized B6D2F2 oocytes using a 3.5-kb fragment released by SalI and BamHI digestion from plasmid pCAG-hSpmSyn, which was constructed by replacing the insert encoding green fluorescent protein in plasmid pCX-EGFP (34Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar, 35Sawicki J.A. Morris R.J. Monks B. Sakai K. Miyazaki J.-I. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with the human spermine synthase cDNA (33Ikeguchi Y. Wang X. McCloskey D.E. Coleman C.S. Nelson P. Hu G. Shantz L.M. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from the tails as above and subjected to PCR analysis to identify mice bearing the transgene. For identification of the CAG/SpmS, the 5′ sense primer used was 5′-TTCGGCTTCTGGCGTGTGAC-3′, which corresponds to a sequence in the actin promoter region and the 3′ antisense primer was 5′-CCAGTACTGTCCTGACTC-3′, which corresponds to nucleotides 300–317 in the spermine synthase coding sequence. A 440-bp fragment was produced from the transgene. Phosphate Assays—The plasma level of phosphate was measured by a colorimetric assay. Blood from a retro-orbital bleed was collected in heparinized microcentrifuge tubes and spun at 14,000 rpm (15,000 × g) for 15 min, and then plasma was prepared for analysis. Aliquots of 20 μl of plasma were mixed with 1.35 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (15,000 × g) for 10 min. One ml of supernatant was placed into a clean glass tube and mixed with 2 ml of 2% ascorbic acid, 0.5% ammonium molybdate, and 1.2 n H2SO4. Samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min and cooled for 10 min at room temperature, and absorbance was measured on a spectrophotometer at 820 nm. Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Tissues were fixed in methyl Carnoy's solution (60% methanol, 30% chloroform, and 10% acetic acid) for 24 h. The fixed testes were embedded in paraffin wax, and 5-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis. Staining for PCNA 1The abbreviation used is: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen. was carried out as follows. After deparaffinization and rehydration, sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidases. Antigen retrieval was performed by heating to 92 °C in antigen unmasking solution (Vector H-3300) three times with 5-min incubations in between in a microwave at 20% power. Slides were cooled to room temperature for at least 30 min. They were then blocked with nonspecific serum (10% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, Vector S-1000) for 1 h. The slides were then incubated with mouse anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number SC-56) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. They were then incubated with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (1:500; Dako catalog number E0433) for 45 min followed by Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:1000; Dako catalog number P0397). Immunostaining was detected with AEC peroxidase substrate kit (Vector SK-4200) and counter-stained with hematoxylin QS (Vector H-3404). Slides were dehydrated and mounted with permount (Cytoseal-60). Digital photographs were taken with a Nikon-TMS microscope and Nikon Coolpix 950 camera. Restoration of Polyamines in Gy Mice—In agreement with previous reports (24Mackintosh C.A. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 439-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Meyer Jr., R.A. Henley C.M. Meyer M.H. L. M.P. McDonald A.G. Mills C. Price D.K.

Spermine was restored in the tissues in the Gy-CAG/SpmS mice (Table II). Although the amount of spermine synthase that is produced from the CAG-driven transgene is greatly in excess of that present in normal mice (Table I), the spermine levels in the Gy-CAG/SpmS mice were only slightly elevated in most tissues (Table II).Table ISpermine synthase activity in Gy and Gy-CAG/SpmS mice Results are shown as mean ± S.D.

https://openalex.org/W2046015849,"In eukaryotes, Rad51 and Rad54 functionally cooperate to mediate homologous recombination and the repair of damaged chromosomes by recombination. Rad51, the eukaryotic counterpart of the bacterial RecA recombinase, forms filaments on single-stranded DNA that are capable of pairing the bound DNA with a homologous double-stranded donor to yield joint molecules. Rad54 enhances the homologous DNA pairing reaction, and this stimulatory effect involves a physical interaction with Rad51. Correspondingly, the ability of Rad54 to hydrolyze ATP and introduce superhelical tension into covalently closed circular plasmid DNA is stimulated by Rad51. By controlled proteolysis, we show that the amino-terminal region of yeast Rad54 is rather unstructured. Truncation mutations that delete the N-terminal 113 or 129 amino acid residues of Rad54 attenuate or ablate physical and functional interactions with Rad51 under physiological ionic strength, respectively. Surprisingly, under less stringent conditions, the Rad54 Δ129 protein can interact with Rad51 in affinity pull-down and functional assays. These results highlight the functional importance of the N-terminal Rad51 interaction domain of Rad54 and reveal that Rad54 contacts Rad51 through separable epitopes.

Homologous recombination (HR) 1The abbreviations used are: HR, homologous recombination; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: HR, homologous recombination; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GST, glutathione S-transferase. is the major pathway for the error-free repair of DNA double strand breaks (1Paques F.

Impaired HR leads to genetic instability and the cancer phenotype in humans (3Pierce A.J. Stark J.M. Araujo F.D. Moynahan M.E. Berwick M. Jasin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S52-S59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), as aptly illustrated in certain familial breast cancer patients who harbor mutations in the tumor suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2 (4Shivji M.K. Venkitaraman A.R. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Defective HR is also associated with a marked cellular sensitivity toward ionizing radiation, DNA cross-linking agents, and other DNA-damaging agents. More recently, a role for HR in the restart of collapsed replication forks has been suggested. In mitotic cells, the homologous DNA from the sister chromatid is most often used to direct the repair of damaged DNA by HR. During meiosis, recombination between homologous chromosomes from the maternal and paternal genomes is the basis for genetic diversity. Moreover, meiotic recombination leads to the physical linkage of homologous chromosomes that is indispensable for their proper segregation (5Petronczki M. Siomos M.F. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2003; 112: 423-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). The genetic requirement for double strand break repair by HR is best understood in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (reviewed in Refs. 1Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Mutant analyses in this organism have led to the identification of the RAD52 epistasis group of genes. Current models suggest that DNA double strand breaks are processed by a 5′ → 3′ exonuclease and that the resulting single-stranded tails are initially occupied by the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, which is subsequently replaced by a helical protein filament of the Rad51 recombinase. The assembly of the Rad51 single-stranded DNA nucleoprotein filament, also known as the presynaptic filament, is facilitated by several HR factors, namely Rad52, the Rad55-Rad57 complex, and possibly Rad54. Once assembled, the presynaptic filament conducts a search for a homologous double-stranded donor and invades the donor to yield a displacement loop (D-loop) (7Sung P. Krejci L. Van Komen S. Sehorn M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42729-42732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), the length of which is extended by branch migration. The D-loop is finally resolved by one of several pathways (reviewed in Ref. 6Haber J.E. Ira G. Malkova A. Sugawara N. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2004; 359: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Rad54 has been implicated in several distinct steps of the recombination reaction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses suggest that Rad54 is recruited early to the site of a double strand break before synapsis of the recombining DNAs occurs (8Wolner B. Van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Rad54 promotes the assembly and enhances the stability of the presynaptic filament in vitro (8Wolner B. Van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14029-14036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), but it is debatable whether these activities of Rad54 are germane for the targeting of Rad51 to recombination sites in cells (8Wolner B. Van Komen S. Sung P. Peterson C.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 221-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 11Sugawara N. Wang X. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Rad54 physically associates with Rad51 in vitro and in vivo (12Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 13Clever B. Interthal H. Schmuckli-Maurer J. King J. Sigrist M. Heyer W.D.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33181-33186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of Rad54 places it in the Swi2/Snf2 family of proteins (16Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Rad54 hydrolyzes ATP in the presence of DNA, and the free energy derived from ATP hydrolysis fuels its translocation on double-stranded DNA, which induces dynamic topological changes in the DNA. Biochemical and scanning force microscopic analyses have revealed that both positive and negative supercoils are introduced by the translocating Rad54 (17Tan T.L. Essers J. Citterio E.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42790-42794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, negative supercoiling by Rad54 leads to transient DNA strand separation, as evidenced by an increased sensitivity of double-stranded DNA toward nicking by the single strand-specific nuclease P1 (19Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that Rad54 is capable of separating the strands of the donor duplex molecule, rendering it accessible for strand invasion by the Rad51 presynaptic filament. Alternatively, or in addition, Rad54 may facilitate the search of DNA homology by pumping DNA along the presynaptic filament (9Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 19Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Stratton S. Sung P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 563-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The intimate collaboration between Rad54 and Rad51 in DNA joint formation is readily demonstrated in the D-loop reaction (12Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The specificity of this interaction is indicated by the fact that only proteins from the same species cooperate in D-loop formation (9Mazin A.V. Bornarth C.J. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Rad54 has recently been shown to remodel chromatin and to promote D-loop formation with chromatinized DNA templates (22Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T.

The biochemical and genetic experiments described above provide ample evidence for functional and physical interactions between Rad54 and the Rad51 recombinase. To begin dissecting the interactions between the two HR factors, we have carried out a deletion analysis of the S. cerevisiae Rad54 protein. Our results show that truncated forms of Rad54 that are compromised for physical interaction with Rad51 retain normal levels of ATPase and DNA supercoiling activities but are unresponsive to Rad51. The attenuated Rad51 binding activity coincides with an impairment of the ability of Rad54 to promote the D-loop reaction. Furthermore, our results provide evidence that Rad54 contacts Rad51 via separable epitopes. Partial Proteolysis and Amino-terminal Sequencing—Rad54 (15 μg) purified from a yeast strain tailored to overexpress this protein (12Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) was incubated with the indicated amount of chymotrypsin or elastase in 30 μl of buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol) at 25 °C. Aliquots (5 μl) were taken at the indicated times, and the digestion was stopped by adding 5 μl of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (50 μm) and 10 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 1% SDS, 360 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Samples were heated for 1 min at 70 °C, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and stained with Coomassie Blue. For amino-terminal sequencing, proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were briefly stained with Coomassie Blue (30 s) and destained with 10% acetic acid and 45% methanol, and the protein bands of interest were excised and analyzed by amino-terminal sequencing in the Molecular Biology Core Facility of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA). Purification of Full-length and Truncated Forms of Rad54 from Escherichia coli—DNA fragments encoding full-length and amino-terminally truncated variants of S. cerevisiae Rad54 protein were amplified by PCR and cloned into the BglII and XhoI restriction sites of pET32a (Novagen). Upstream primers include the consensus sequence for the Rhinovirus PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) and were designed to allow expression of in-frame fusion proteins that harbor a cleavable thioredoxin-His6 affinity tag at their amino terminus. BL21 Rosetta cells (Novagen) were transformed with the recombinant plasmids and grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 0.6. The cultures were shifted to 16 °C and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 15 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml E64, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, 156 μg/ml benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml chymostatin) before being frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. The thawed cells (100 g) were resuspended in 300 ml of buffer A (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors as above) containing 150 mm KCl and lysed by passing twice through a cell disruptor (Avestin). Lysates were clarified for 30 min at 40,000 × g, and the supernatant was loaded onto a P11 phosphocellulose column (120 ml; Whatman). The P11 column was developed with a gradient of 100–1000 mm KCl in buffer A, with Rad54 eluting at ∼400 mm KCl. Rad54 and other proteins were precipitated with 0.4 g/ml ammonium sulfate, redissolved in 40 ml of buffer B (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 8.0, 600 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors as above), and loaded onto a 10-ml Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) column. The Ni2+-NTA matrix was washed with 200 ml of buffer B containing 300 mm KCl, and bound proteins were eluted by a gradient of 10–250 mm imidazole in buffer B. After adding dithiothreitol (1 mm final) and EDTA (2 mm final) to the imidazole eluate that contained Rad54, the thioredoxin-His6 affinity tag was cleaved off by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with recombinant Rhinovirus PreScission protease (1:200 (w/w) of protease to Rad54). The released protein was diluted with buffer A to a conductivity reading corresponding to 100 mm KCl and loaded onto a Mono S column (8 ml), which was developed with a KCl gradient of 100–1000 mm KCl in buffer A. Peak fractions were pooled and applied onto a Superdex S-200 column (330 ml), which was developed with buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 ml NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). We also purified Rad54 and its truncated variants with the thioredoxin His6 affinity tag intact for the pull-down experiment presented in Fig. 4B. DNA Substrates—ϕX174 replicative form I DNA and viral (+)-strand DNA were from Invitrogen and New England Biolabs, respectively. The ϕX replicative form I DNA was relaxed by treatment with calf thymus topoisomerase I (Invitrogen), as described previously (21Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). pBluescript form I double-stranded DNA was prepared using standard methods. For the DNA mobility shift assays, the 83-mer oligonucleotide 3 (21Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) was 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). After removing the unincorporated nucleotide in a Spin 30 column (Bio-Rad), the radiolabeled oligonucleotide 3 was annealed to its complement by heating the mixture of the two oligonucleotides at 75 °C for 10 min and slow cooling to 23 °C. The resulting duplex was purified from a 10% polyacrylamide gel by overnight diffusion at 4 °C into TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA), as described (21Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The 90-mer oligonucleotide D1 used in the D-loop reaction is complementary to pBluescript SK DNA from positions 1932–2022 (25Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43578-43587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P] ATP and then purified using the MERmaid Spin Kit (Bio101). This substrate was stored in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm EDTA). ATPase Assay—Rad54, Rad54 Δ113, and Rad54 Δ129 proteins (75 nm each) were incubated with ϕX174 replicative form I DNA (30 μm base pairs) in 10 μl of buffer D (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA)) with 1.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP and the indicated amounts of KCl at 23 °C. To examine the effect of Rad51 on ATP hydrolysis by the full-length and truncated Rad54 proteins, Rad51 (300 nm) was mixed with Rad54, Rad54 Δ113, and Rad54 Δ129 (75 nm each) at 0 °C for 20 min prior to the addition of ϕX174 replicative form I DNA and incubation at 23 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA to 250 mm and then subject to thin layer chromatography in polyethyleneimine plates (J. T. Baker), as described (21Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The amount of labeled phosphate released as a result of ATP hydrolysis was quantified by phosphorimaging analysis in a Personal FX phosphor imager with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). DNA Mobility Shift—Rad54, Rad54 Δ113, and Rad54 Δ129 (50–200 nm each) and the 32P-labeled 83-mer duplex substrate (1.25 μm nucleotides) were incubated for 10 min at 23 °C in 10 μl of buffer D containing 60 mm KCl with or without 2.5 mm ATP and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 10 mm creatine phosphate and 30 μg/ml creatine kinase. Where indicated, the reactions were deproteinated with 0.5% SDS and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 5 min. After adding 2 μl of loading buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% orange G, 50% glycerol), the reaction mixtures were analyzed in 10% native polyacrylamide gels run in TAE buffer at 4 °C. The gels were dried and analyzed in the phosphor imager. Rad51 and Rad54 Complex Formation—Rad51 and BSA were coupled to Affi-Gel 15 beads (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions to create matrices containing 3 mg/ml Rad51 and 12 mg/ml BSA. To examine binding of Rad54, Rad54 Δ113, and Rad54 Δ129 to the affinity beads, 5 μg of these proteins were mixed with 6 μl of Affi-Rad51 or Affi-BSA beads in 30 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 150 mm KCl). The reactions were incubated for 45 min on ice with gentle mixing every 2 min. The beads were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed. After being washed twice with 100 μl of binding buffer, the Affi-Rad51 and Affi-BSA beads were treated with 30 μl of 3% SDS at 37 °C for 10 min to elute bound Rad54. The supernatant containing unbound Rad54 (10 μl), the second wash (15 μl), and the SDS eluate (10 μl) were subject to SDS-PAGE in a 7.5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel to determine their content of Rad54. For affinity pull-down through the His6 tag on Rad54, Rad51 (3 μg) was incubated with His6-Rad54, His6-Rad54 Δ113, or His6-Rad54 Δ129 (1.25 μg) in 30 μl of buffer E (20 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 15 mm KCl and 10 mm imidazole. After 30 min of incubation at 0 °C, 10 μl of nickel-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) were added, and the reaction mixtures were left at 0 °C for another 60 min, with gentle mixing every 2 min. The beads were washed twice with 30 μl of buffer D containing 15 mm imidazole before eluting the bound proteins from the nickel matrix with 30 μl of 200 mm imidazole in buffer D. The supernatant containing unbound Rad51 (10 μl), the second wash (15 μl), and the 200 mm imidazole eluate (10 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 12.5% gel and immunoblot analysis with anti-Rad51 antibodies. Interaction of GST-Rad54-(1–107) with Rad51—A DNA fragment encoding residues 1–107 of Rad54 was amplified by PCR and introduced into a modified version of pCDFDuet-1 (Novagen) that expresses the Rad54 fragment as a GST fusion in the E. coli Rosetta strain (Novagen). When the cell density reached an A600 of 0.6, 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and cells were harvested after 3 h of incubation at 37°C. The cell pellet from 50 ml of culture was resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A containing 200 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), and protease inhibitors, as above. Cells were lysed by sonication, and extracts were clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 30 min), and 400 μl of the extract was mixed with 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 12 h at 4 °C. E. coli extract containing GST was similarly treated. The beads containing bound GST-Rad54-(1–107) or GST at 0.1 μg of protein/μl of beads were washed four times with 300 μl of buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) and 25 or 200 mm KCl and stored in 100 μl of the buffer at 4 °C. To express Rad51 in E. coli, the RAD51 gene was amplified by PCR and introduced into pLant2B (RIL). This plasmid was transformed into BL21 cells. When the cell density reached A600 of 0.6, cells were shifted to 16 °C and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 15 h. Cells from 6-liter cultures were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 150 ml of buffer A containing 200 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), and protease inhibitors, as above. Cells were lysed by sonication, and extracts were clarified by centrifugation (40,000 × g, 30 min). The extract was treated with ammonium sulfate (0.22 g/ml), and the protein pellet was stored at 4 °C. For GST pull-down experiments, a small fraction of this ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in buffer A containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors and then adjusted to either 25 mm KCl or 200 mm KCl. The protein solutions (30 μl) were added to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads containing either GST or GST-Rad54-(1–107) followed by a 1-h incubation at 4 °C with gentle mixing. After washing the beads three times with 50 μl of buffer containing either 25 or 200 mm KCl, bound proteins were eluted with 15 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The supernatants (15 μl) and SDS eluates (15 μl) were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue. Topoisomerase I-linked DNA Supercoiling Assay—The indicated amounts of Rad54, Rad54 Δ113, and Rad54 Δ129 were incubated with topologically relaxed ϕX174 DNA (18.5 μm base pairs) for 3 min at 23 °C in 9.5 μl of buffer D with the indicated concentrations of KCl, followed by the addition of 150 ng of E. coli topoisomerase I in 0.5 μl of buffer D. Reactions were incubated at 23 °C for 10 min and processed for agarose gel electrophoresis, as described (21Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of Rad51 on Rad54-catalyzed supercoiling of DNA, Rad54, Rad54 Δ113, and Rad54 Δ129 (40 nm each) were incubated with Rad51 (300 nm) in buffer D containing 20, 60, or 100 mm KCl at 4 °C for 20 min prior to the addition of the DNA substrate and incubation with topoisomerase at 23 °C. D-loop Assay—D-loop reactions were performed by incubating radio-labeled 90-mer oligonucleotide substrate (3.6 μm nucleotides) with Rad51 (1.5 μm) in 10.5 μl of buffer D containing an ATP-regenerating system (20 mm creatine phosphate and 30 μg/ml creatine kinase) and the indicated concentrations of KCl for 5 min at 37 °C. Rad54, Rad54 Δ113, or Rad54 Δ129 (260 nm) was then added in 1 μl, and the mixture was incubated for 2 min at 23 °C. The D-loop reaction was initiated by adding pBluescript replicative form I DNA (35 μm base pairs) in 1 μl. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 23 °C for 4 min and processed for electrophoresis in 0.9% agarose gels in TAE buffer at 23 °C, as previously described (25Van Komen S. Petukhova G. Sigurdsson S. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43578-43587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The gels were dried, and the radiolableled DNA species were visualized and quantified in the phosphor imager. The percentage of D-loop refers to the fraction of the oligonucleotide substrate being incorporated into the replicative form I substrate. Architecture of the Rad54 Protein—Several motifs (Fig. 1) are highly conserved among Rad54 homologues and other Swi2/Snf2-related enzymes (26Bork P. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 751-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These motifs harbor consensus sequences that are related to the superfamily II helicases (SFII). Based on the crystal structures of the SFII helicases eIF4a, UvrB, and RecG, it can be predicted that the central region encompassing the seven helicase-like motifs constitutes the catalytic core of the enzyme that is likely to fold into a tandem repeat of two RecA-type subdomains (27Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The regions being appended to the catalytic core are conserved only among the Rad54 homologues. These flanking regions probably mediate interactions with other recombination proteins. In fact, the amino terminus of Rad54 is involved in an interaction with the Rad51 protein (12Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 13Clever B. Interthal H. Schmuckli-Maurer J. King J. Sigrist M. Heyer W.D.

The Amino Terminus of S. cerevisiae Rad54 Is Prone to Proteolytic Attack—Our results with full-length S. cerevisiae Rad54 overexpressed in yeast cells or bacteria indicated that the amino terminus of Rad54 is prone to proteolytic degradation. We used controlled proteolysis to more specifically examine the domain structure of Rad54. Chymotrypsin cleaves Rad54 at two distinct sites to yield proteolytic fragments of ∼89 and 75 kDa, respectively (A and B in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). Bands of very similar sizes were generated in digests with various other proteases (e.g. elastase (Fig. 2A) and proteinase K) (data not shown), indicating that an unstructured region near the amino terminus of Rad54 was being targeted for cleavage. Peptide sequencing unambiguously identified the amino termini of the chymotryptic fragments A and B (Fig. 2A) as amino acid residues 126 and 228 of Rad54, in agreement with the apparent molecular masses of these proteolytic fragments in SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2A). Expression and Purification of Amino-terminally Truncated Variants of Rad54 —Based on the results of the partial proteolysis experiments described above and on sequence alignments, a number of amino-terminally truncated Rad54 proteins were expressed as thioredoxin-His6 fusion proteins in E. coli cells (Fig. 2B). In these constructs, a site that can be cleaved by the PreScission protease is present between the thioredoxin His6 tag and the Rad54 protein. Overexpression of all of the Rad54 proteins was contingent upon supplementation with rare tRNAs encoded by the Rosetta plasmid (data not shown). With the exception of Rad54 Δ321, which was entirely insoluble, varying amounts of all of the truncated Rad54 species were found in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2B). Rapid protein degradation has thus far prevented us from purifying a significant amount of Rad54 Δ227"
https://openalex.org/W2064221954,"In Toxoplasma gondii, lactate dehydrogenase is encoded by two independent and developmentally regulated genes LDH1 and LDH2. These genes and their products have been implicated in the control of a metabolic flux during parasite differentiation. To investigate the significance of LDH1 and LDH2 in this process, we generated stable transgenic parasite lines in which the expression of these two expressed isoforms of lactate dehydrogenase was knocked down in a stage-specific manner. These LDH knockdown parasites exhibited variable growth rates in either the tachyzoite or the bradyzoite stage, as compared with the parental parasites. Their differentiation processes were impaired when the parasites were grown under in vitro conditions. In vivo studies in a murine model system revealed that tachyzoites of these parasite lines were unable to form significant numbers of tissue cysts and to establish a chronic infection. Most importantly, all mice that were initially infected with tachyzoites of either of the four LDH knockdown lines survived a subsequent challenge with tachyzoites of the parental parasites (104), a dose that usually causes 100% mortality, suggesting that live vaccination of mice with the LDH knockdown tachyzoites can confer protection against T. gondii. Thus, we conclude that LDH expression is essential for parasite differentiation. The knockdown of LDH1 and LDH2 expression gave rise to virulence-attenuated parasites that were unable to exhibit a significant brain cyst burden in a murine model of chronic infection.

Thus, we conclude that LDH expression is essential for parasite differentiation. The knockdown of LDH1 and LDH2 expression gave rise to virulence-attenuated parasites that were unable to exhibit a significant brain cyst burden in a murine model of chronic infection. Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous protozoan parasite that has the ability to infect a variety of warm-blooded vertebrates including humans (1Dubey J.P. J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. 1994; 205: 1593-1598PubMed Google Scholar). This parasite has a complex life cycle involving both sexual and asexual multiplication. The sexual cycle occurs exclusively in feline intestinal epithelial cells. In humans and other intermediate hosts, the parasite exists in the following two asexual forms: rapidly dividing tachyzoites and slowly replicating bradyzoites. Initial and acute infection is characterized by the presence of tachyzoites that are normally cleared by the host immune response. In most cases of human toxoplasmosis, infection ultimately becomes chronic when tachyzoites differentiate into bradyzoites. The bradyzoites can remain dormant within tissue cysts protected from the host immune response (2Soete M. Fortier B. Camus D. Dubremetz J.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 76: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In patients with immunodeficiencies such as AIDS or other malignancies, bradyzoites that differentiate into tachyzoites after release from the cysts can give rise to a recurrent infection that can prove fatal. Congenital malformations are observed when an acute infection is acquired during pregnancy (3Black M.W. Boothroyd J.C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 607-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). At present, no effective treatment for chronic toxoplasmosis is available. Therefore, cell culture and animal models for the study of chronic Toxoplasma infection are crucial. The differentiation of tachyzoites to bradyzoites can be induced in vitro, although the genetic regulatory signals that control this differentiation are still unknown (2Soete M. Fortier B. Camus D. Dubremetz J.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 76: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 4Freyre A. J. Parasitol. 1995; 81: 1008-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

Some of these genes are developmentally regulated and suspected to be crucial for T. gondii differentiation (12Boothroyd J.C. Black M. Bonnefoy S. Hehl A. Knoll L.J. Manger I.D. Ortega-Barria E.

Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate to lactate. This enzyme plays an indispensable role when glycolysis becomes the only pathway to provide energy under anaerobic conditions (14Kavanagh K.L. Elling R.A. Wilson D.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). LDH is considered as a potential anti-parasitic drug target because its unique structural and kinetic properties differ from those of human host cells (14Kavanagh K.L. Elling R.A. Wilson D.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 879-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Dando C. Schroeder E.R. Hunsaker L.A. Deck L.M. Royer R.E. Zhou X. Parmley S.F. Vander Jagt D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Winter V.J. Cameron A. Tranter R. Sessions R.B. Brady R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 131: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Among the reported LDH sequences, those of T. gondii and all members of the Plasmodium genus carry a pentapeptide insertion into the enzyme-active site (16Winter V.J. Cameron A. Tranter R. Sessions R.B. Brady R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 131: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The activity of LDHs is generally inhibited by an excess of pyruvate. However, this property is greatly reduced in the LDHs from Plasmodium and Toxoplasma (15Dando C. Schroeder E.R. Hunsaker L.A. Deck L.M. Royer R.E. Zhou X. Parmley S.F. Vander Jagt D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Winter V.J. Cameron A. Tranter R. Sessions R.B. Brady R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 131: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In T. gondii, two LDH isoforms are present, LDH1 and LDH2. The genes encoding the isoforms show 64% nucleotide sequence identity, and their gene products share 71% amino acid sequence identity (17Parmley S.F. Weiss L.M. Yang S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The genes encoding LDH1 and LDH2 isoforms are developmentally regulated. The mRNA of LDH2 is detected in the bradyzoite stage only, whereas the transcript of LDH1 is found in both bradyzoites and tachyzoites. The LDH1 gene product is only expressed in tachyzoites, whereas that of LDH2 is expressed in only bradyzoites. It is speculated that LDH1 is replaced by LDH2 during development from tachyzoites to bradyzoites as a consequence of post-transcriptional induction of LDH2 (8Yang S. Parmey S.F. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 184: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Parmley S.F. Weiss L.M. Yang S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). During differentiation, T. gondii modifies its morphology and energy metabolism to adapt to its surrounding environment. Aerobic respiration and glycolysis are functional in tachyzoites, whereas glycolysis is the only energy source in bradyzoites (15Dando C. Schroeder E.R. Hunsaker L.A. Deck L.M. Royer R.E. Zhou X. Parmley S.F. Vander Jagt D.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 118: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Denton H. Roberts C.W. Alexander J. Thong K.W. Coombs G.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 137: 103-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, LDH, which is important for anaerobic respiration, might be a promising target for developing drugs for chronic toxoplasmosis. Over the last few years, effective methods of transfection and targeted disruption of genes has made T. gondii amenable to genetic manipulations (19Black M.W. Boothroyd J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3972-3979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition to these conventional gene manipulations, we previously reported that the introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), presumably via RNAi, can lower the expression of T. gondii genes (21Al-Anouti F. Ananvoranich S. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2002; 12: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 22Al-Anouti F. Quach T. Ananvoranich S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here we report the first success in knocking down the expression of the essential genes LDH1 and LDH2 in T. gondii. Significantly, we have provided the evidence that the expression of LDH1 and LDH2 is essential for parasite development. The knockdown of LDH1 and LDH2 expression gave rise to virulence-attenuated parasites that were unable to exhibit a significant brain cyst burden in a murine model of chronic infection. All experiments were carried out using human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) that were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 5 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 units/ml penicillin in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Generation of LDH knockdown parasites was performed using the HXG-PRT-deficient (ΔHXGPRT) T. gondii, strain PLK (23Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, National Institutes of Health, catalogue number 2860). Parasites were maintained as tachyzoites using HFF monolayers grown in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Wisent, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). To differentiate the parasites into bradyzoites, freshly lysed parasites were allowed to invade HFF for 4 h. The media were subsequently replaced with RPMI containing 10 mm HEPES and 5% fetal bovine serum, pH 8.2. The medium was replaced every 2 days to maintain the pH (6Cleary M.D. Singh U. Blader I.J. Brewer J.L. Boothroyd J.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Parasites were harvested immediately after they had lysed out of HFF monolayers. After 4–6 days of bradyzoite differentiation using the alkaline method (7Manger I.D. Hehl A. Parmley S. Sibley L.D. Marra M. Hillier L. Waterston R. Boothroyd J.C. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1632-1637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cysts were freed from cells by scraping and digestion with 170 mm NaCl-pepsin (0.1 mg/ml) to 60 mm HCl for 1 min at 37 °C followed by neutralization with 94 mm Na2CO3. Collected parasites were passed through a 27-gauge needle twice and filtered through a 3-μm filter (Nucleopore). Filter-purified parasites were then collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min and washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. Bradyzoite-specific Expression Plasmids—A DNA fragment (993 bp) encompassing the LDH2 promoter region, referred to as L2, was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from T. gondii PLK strain using the oligonucleotides KpnILDH2(sense) and LDH2(antisense). The fragment was cloned into pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) at KpnI and a blunted XhoI site. The second L2 fragment was produced by PCR using the oligonucleotides SacILDH2(sense) and XbaILDH2(antisense) and was cloned between SacI and XbaI sites. Portions of LDH1 and LDH2 ORF (nucleotides 1–487, GenBank™ accession numbers U35118 and U23207, respectively) were amplified by PCR from plasmids pMAL-C2-LDH1 and pMAL-C2-LDH2 (8Yang S. Parmey S.F. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 184: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and cloned at the SmaI site. The 1.8-kb HXGPRT minigene was isolated from plasmid pTUB5mycGFPHXGPRT (obtained from Dr. Dominique Soldati, Imperial College London, UK) by SacII digestion and subcloned into the constructed plasmids. The resultant plasmids, which had two L2 fragments arranged in a head-to-head fashion flanking LDH1 and LDH2 cDNA, were named pL2-LDH1-L2 and pL2-LDH2-L2, respectively. Tachyzoite-specific Expression Plasmids—The plasmid p30/11UP30/11, which contains the ORF of uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (UPRT, 21), was removed by digestion with NsiI and AgeI. The LDH1 and LDH2 ORF portions were then cloned separately by blunt end ligation to replace the UPRT cDNA. The resultant plasmids had two modified SAG1 promoters arranged in a head-to-head fashion flanking either LDH1 or LDH2 coding region. The 1.8-kb HXGPRT minigene was cloned at SacII site to give rise to plasmids p30/11LDH130/11 and p30/11LDH230/11. The resultant plasmids were individually introduced into PLKΔHXGPRT parasites by electroporation (20Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Stable populations were selected using 25 μg/ml mycophenolic acid and 50 μg/ml xanthine. Electroporation with p30/11LDH130/11 and pL2LDH1L2 gave rise to transgenic parasite lines TL1T and BL1B, which produce dsRNA homologous to LDH1 in the tachyzoite and bradyzoite stage, respectively. Electroporation with p30/11LDH230/11 and pL2LDH2L2 resulted in the generation of parasite lines TL2T and BL2B, which express dsRNA homologous to LDH2 in the tachyzoite and bradyzoite stage, respectively. Four transgenic parasite lines were generated, namely TL1T, TL2T, BL1B, and BL2B. For clarity, T and B refer to the tachyzoite- or the bradyzoite-specific expression, respectively, whereas L1 and L2 refer to the LDH1 and LDH2, respectively. Genomic DNA was prepared as described previously (21Al-Anouti F. Ananvoranich S. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2002; 12: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and RNA extractions were carried out by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen.). For Southern blot analysis, 10 μg of genomic DNA was digested with the BamHI or PstI restriction enzymes and resolved on 0.7% agarose. Resolved DNA fragments were then transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Pall Life Sciences) using 10× SSC as transfer buffer. Hybridization was carried out at 68 °C in the presence of the DIG-labeled heat-denatured probe. The blots were then washed with a solution of 0.5× SSC and 0.01% SDS at 65 °C. Immunological detection was performed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG Fab fragments and disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)-tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate chemiluminescent substrate (Roche Applied Science). The signal was finally revealed by the Alpha Imager system (Alpha Innotech) and quantified using the ChemImager version 5.5. For Northern blotting, 8 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed onto 1% agarose, 2.7% formaldehyde gel. The RNA was transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane and probed as for Southern blots except that the hybridization was performed at 58 °C and the washes were at 54 °C. Immunological detection was carried out to reveal hybridization signals. The probe was then removed by incubating the blot in a denaturing buffer containing 200 mm NaOH and 0.1% SDS. The blot was then re-hybridized with another probe. For each sample, the signal detected for each target gene expression was normalized by the signals detected for a constitutively expressed gene that was used as an internal standard. Thus, the presented data exhibit no influence from variable sample handling. Dot blots were performed using low amounts of RNA (2 μg), and hybridization was carried out under similar conditions as those of Northern blot (22Al-Anouti F. Quach T. Ananvoranich S. Biochem.

Quach T. Ananvoranich S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For the detection of ENO2 mRNA, primers 5ENOx and 3ENOx were used for the synthesis of an ENO2-specific probe. The oligonucleotides LDH1–5′-UTR and LDH2– 5′-UTR specific to LDH1 and LDH2 mRNA were synthesized (Sigma Genosys) and subjected to tailing reactions using terminal transferase. The reactions were performed at 37 °C for 1 h in a 20-μl volume containing 100 pmol of the oligonucleotide, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.6, 0.2 m potassium cacodylate, 5 mm CoCl2, 50 μm DIG-dUTP, 0.5 mm dATP, and 25 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Roche Applied Science). Reverse transcription (RT) reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 60 min using 2 μg of DNase-treated total RNA as initial template, 10 pmol of oligonucleotide primer in a total volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm of each dNTP, 50 units of RNase inhibitor, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase. For the detection of LDH1 antisense RNA, the oligonucleotide LDH-ORF(sense) was used as the RT primer. In parallel, for the detection of LDH2 antisense RNA, the oligonucleotide LDH2forward was utilized as the RT primer. Eight μl of the RT reaction mixtures were used for the PCR amplifications. The PCR was performed in a volume of 100 μl containing 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 μm dNTPs, 10 pmol of primers (LDH-ORF(sense) and 3LDH-ORF(antisense) for RT-PCR of LDH1 antisense RNA or LDH2forward and LDH2reverse for RT-PCR of LDH2 antisense RNA), and 2 units of TaqDNA polymerase. To rule out the presence of genomic DNA contamination in the extracted RNA samples, control experiments were conducted by directly subjecting RNA preparations to PCR.

For the synthesis of dsRNA homologous to LDH1 and LDH2, plasmids pMAL-C2-LDH1 and pMAL-C2-LDH2 (17Parmley S.F. Weiss L.M. Yang S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 73: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were used as templates. For the synthesis of dsRNA homologous to ROP1, UPRT, and GFP, pBS-ROP1 (obtained from NIH-AIDS reagents), pUPRT (obtained from Dr. Ullman, Oregon Health and Science University), and pGFP-N1 (Clontech) were used, respectively, as template plasmids. The primer pairs, T7on5′LDH1 and T7on3′LDH1, T7on5′LDH2 and T7on3′LDH2, T7on5′ROP1 and T7on3′ROP1, T7on5′UPRT and T7on3′UPRT, and T7on5′GFP and T7on3′GFP, were used in individual PCRs for the production of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter-bearing DNA templates. Resultant DNA templates were then transcribed in vitro into the corresponding dsRNAs at 37 °C in 100-μl reaction mixtures containing 100 nmol of DNA templates, 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 units of RNase inhibitor, 2.5 mm rNTP, 200 units of T7 RNA polymerase, and 1:100 dilution pyrophosphate. The dsRNAs homologous to LDH1 (nt 1–487, GenBank™ accession number U35118), LDH2 (nt 1–487, GenBank™ U23207), ROP1 (nt 1–502, GenBank™ AA037935), UPRT (nt 1–724, GenBank™ U10246), and GFP (nt 1–500, GenBank™ AF420592) were obtained. ROP1, UPRT, and GFP genes were used as controls. The ROP1 gene was chosen because it is an endogenous housekeeping gene that does not share any sequence similarity with LDH1 nor LDH2. The UPRT gene was included because it is an endogenous nonessential gene that was successfully knocked down in previous studies (21Al-Anouti F. Ananvoranich S. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2002; 12: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The GFP gene was used because it is exogenous and completely unrelated to T. gondii genes. The hairpin RNA (hpRNA) is an RNA structure that consists of a 21-bp-long RNA duplex with a 5′-hydroxyl terminus and a 2-nt 3′-overhang. For the synthesis of hpRNA homologous to LDH1, the oligonucleotides hpLDH1 and T7 were heated at 95 °C for 2 min in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm MgCl2 and were slowly cooled down to allow for annealing. The annealed oligonucleotides were subsequently used to produce hairpin RNA by in vitro transcription. Similarly, the oligonucleotides hpLDH2 and T7 were used to produce hairpin RNA homologous to LDH2. Parasites were freshly harvested from infected HFF cells as described above and resuspended in the cytomix buffer (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10 mm K2HPO4, KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2) freshly supplemented with 2 mm ATP and 5 mm glutathione. The tested dsRNA was added to the resuspended parasites in 4-mm electroporation cuvettes, and electroporation was carried out using the BTX Electro cell Manipulator (25 megohms, 25 microfarads, and 1.8 keV). After a 20-min incubation period at room temperature, the parasites were inoculated in triplicate into confluent HFF cells grown in 24-well plates at ∼104 parasites per well and incubated at 37 °C. The extracellular parasites were removed by replacing the medium 4 h post-infection. Parasite growth was subsequently measured by the [3H]uracil or [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation assay (20Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 295-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Parasites were inoculated onto HFF monolayers grown on glass slides. Cultures containing tachyzoites were then allowed to grow for 2–3 days, whereas intracellular bradyzoites were cultured for 4 days before analysis. All experiments were set up in duplicate and repeated at least twice. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Cells were then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were then incubated for 1 h with either the rabbit LDH1 or LDH2 antiserum (diluted 1:500). For cyst staining, Dolichos biflorus agglutinin conjugated to FITC (diluted 1:300, Sigma) was added for 1 h. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to rhodamine (diluted 1:5000, Molecular Probes). Staining of the nuclei was carried out by incubation in the presence of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 1 h and three washings with PBS (13Yahiaoui B. Dzierszinski F. Bernigaud A. Slomianny C. Camus D. Tomavo S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After drying, slides were overlaid with fluoromount and examined with a Leica DMIRB microscope. All images were taken with a cooled Q-Imaging CCD camera using the Improvision Openlab software. Tachyzoites and bradyzoites (107 parasites) were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of a solution containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride protease inhibitor. Cell-free lysates were obtained by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm and kept at–80 °C until use. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin (Promega) as standard. LDH enzymatic assays were carried out at 37 °C in a final volume of 1 ml. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1.6 mm pyruvate (Sigma) to a mixture containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml NADH (Sigma), and 30 μg of protein extract. All assays were monitored at 340 nm for the change in absorbance related to the change in the concentration of NADH (18Denton H. Roberts C.W. Alexander J. Thong K.W. Coombs G.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 137: 103-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the specificity of the reactions, control assays that lacked protein extracts were carried out. Approximately 107 tachyzoites and bradyzoites were collected and boiled in SDS loading buffer (6.25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% sucrose, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 10 min. The samples were resolved on a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electro-blotting (Bio-Rad) for 2 h at 80 mV. The blots were then incubated in a solution containing the polyclonal antibody specific to LDH1 or LDH2 for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) was subsequently used. After washing with 20 mm Tris-HCl and 0.3% Tween 20, chemiluminescent detection was performed using the chemi-glow detection kit (Alpha Innotech). Control samples were LDH1 and LDH2 fusion proteins prepared from bacteria harboring plasmids pMAL-C2-LDH1 and pMAL-C2-LDH2 (8Yang S. Parmey S.F. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 184: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The bacterial cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h and collected. Crude protein extracts containing LDH1 and LDH2 fusion proteins were obtained after sonication in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and were run along with parasite protein lysates on 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Purified tachyzoites from the parental PLKΔHXGPRT described above, TL1T, TL2T, BL1B, and BL2B, were inoculated into groups of five female 8–9-week-old BALB/c mice at 103 or 104 parasites per mouse and monitored until death or survival for 1 or 2 months. To check that surviving mice were infected and the immune response had developed in the infected mice, the serum of each mouse was tested against the total extract antigens prepared from the parental parasites using Western blots. To assess whether the primary infection of mice with TL1T, TL2T, BL1B, and BL2B tachyzoites conferred protection against the parental parasites, infected mice that surv"

Mutations at the N-terminal end confirmed the inhibitory function of this zone, known as apoptotic regulation of targeting (ART). On the other hand, mutations at the C-terminal end of the protein support the hypothesis that the hydrophobic helix α9 is not required for the insertion of BAX. In addition, three mutations (a T174D single substitution in the helix α9, a K189E/K190E double substitution at the end of the protein, and a P168A mutation in the loop before α9) exhibited a strong binding capacity, a strong insertion, as well as high ability to induce cytochrome c release. Considering the positions of these mutations and their potential effect on the movement of helix α9, we propose that the C-terminal end of the protein behaves like a second ART. Also, opposite to a mutation that changes the conformation of the N-terminal ART, the mutations in the C-terminal part of the protein impaired the inhibitory effect of anti-apoptotic BCL-xL over BAX insertion, suggesting that the conformation of the α9-helix plays a significant role in BAX/BCL-xL interaction.

Apoptosis, the main form of programmed cell death, is a highly regulated phenomenon. It is now largely accepted that mitochondria play a key role in regulating the apoptotic process by controlling the release of several proteins, termed apoptogenic factors, required for the acquisition of apoptotic hallmarks (for review see Refs. 1Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 10: 369-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1696) Google Scholar and 2Van Gurp M. Festjens N. Van Loo G. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This release strictly depends on the action of a family of proteins, termed the BCL-2 family, that modulates the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane to the apoptogenic factors (for review see Refs. 3Gross A. Mc Donnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar and 4Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Moreover, the alteration of the bioenergetic capacity of mitochondria following the action of BCL-2 family members is thought to be further involved in the regulation of apoptosis by the production of reactive oxygen species (for review see Ref. 5Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 327-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or the release of Ca2+ (for review see Ref. 6Hajnoczky G. Davies E. Madesh M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Among the BCL-2 family members, the pro-apoptotic protein BAX plays a crucial role (for review see Ref. 7Adams J.M. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). BAX is expressed at basal levels in nearly all mammalian cells. In healthy cells, it behaves as a soluble protein and is localized in the cytosol; following apoptotic induction, the protein is translocated to the mitochondrial outer membrane where it behaves as a membrane-inserted protein (8Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar, 9Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and actively participates in the release of apoptogenic factors. The molecular mechanisms governing the cytosol-to-mitochondria translocation of BAX therefore appear as a critical regulation in the implementation of apoptosis. The changes in the physical properties of BAX accompanying its translocation strongly support the hypothesis that profound conformational changes are the basis of the change in the localization of the protein. Analysis of the primary structure of BAX reveals that, like all BCL-2 family members, it is a relatively hydrophilic protein with only a predicted hydrophobic α-helix of 18 residues close to the C-terminal end. The tertiary structure of the soluble form of BAX was determined by NMR (10Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The protein is formed of nine α-helices, the last one being hydrophobic, and a poorly resolved 15-residue-long N-terminal end, having a high mobility. The role of this N-terminal zone has been revealed to be crucial in the regulation of addressing BAX to mitochondria; the deletion of this zone increases in vitro binding of the protein to isolated mitochondria, increases in vivo mitochondria localization of a BAX-GFP 1The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; ART, apoptotic regulation of targeting. fusion protein, and increases pro-apoptotic activity of the protein (8Wolter K.G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is therefore considered that its native structure is a negative regulator of the addressing of BAX to mitochondria and is named the apoptotic regulation of targeting (ART) sequence (8Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). At the other end of the protein, the role of the hydrophobic helix α9 as the membrane anchor has been considered obvious for a long time. The homologous sequences in anti-apoptotic BCL-2 and BCL-xL are clearly membrane anchors; their deletion impairs both mitochondria localization and anti-apoptotic activities of the proteins (14Nguyen M. Millar D.G. Wong V.W. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25265-25268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Janiak F. Leber B. Andrews S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9842-9849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and there were no objective reasons to think that this could be different for BAX. The BAX α9-helix was shown to be able to drive the membrane insertion of a reporter protein (16Martinez-Senac M. Corbalan-Garcia S. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9983-9992Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but this observation is not absolute evidence because most hydrophobic α-helices are able to do so provided they are long enough. A confirmation of the role of α9 as the primary membrane anchor of BAX was apparently gained when it was shown that its deletion prevented mitochondria localization of a GFP-BAX fusion protein (17Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). In contrast to these observations, it should be noted that numerous reports (18Lewis S. Bethel S.S. Patel S. Martinou J.C. Antonsson B. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar) described the mitochondrial binding and cytochrome c release activity of recombinant BAX (produced in bacteria), which, for technical reasons, was a protein deprived of α9. Also, one report (20Tremblais K. Oliver L. Juin P. Le Cabellec M.T. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 582-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) described that overexpression of a C-terminally truncated BAX was able to induce apoptosis. BAX expression in yeast was first used as a simple functional test for assaying the interactions between BCL-2 family members (two-hybrid system). Most surprisingly, it was found that the LexA-BAX fusion protein was able to kill yeast and that this death was prevented by the co-expression of BCL-2 or BCL-xL-based fusion proteins (21Zha H. Fisk H.A. Yaffe M.P. Mahajan N. Herman B. Reed J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6494-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). It was further shown that a C-terminal c-Myc-tagged human BAX not only killed yeast (22Greenhalf W. Stephan C. Chaudhuri B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 23Clow A. Greenhalf W. Chaudhuri B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) but also induced cytochrome c release, before killing the cells (24Manon S. Chaudhuri B. Guérin M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an N-terminal hemagglutinin-tagged mouse BAX was shown to induce other apoptotic hallmarks in yeast (25Ligr M. Madeo F. Frohlich E. Hilt W. Frohlich K.U. Wolf D.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Because of the relative easiness of yeast manipulation and the fact that BAX could be expressed independently from the apoptotic network, yeast was used as a tool to test the molecular hypotheses underlying the mechanism of BAX translocation to mitochondria (for review see Ref. 26Priault M. Camougrand N. Kinnally K.W. Vallette F.M. Manon S. FEMS Yeast Res. 2003; 4: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Particularly, yeast has proven to be useful to question the actual role of different mitochondrial proteins in their interaction with BAX (27Priault M. Chaudhuri B. Clow A. Camougrand N. Manon S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Priault M. Camougrand N. Chaudhuri B. Schaeffer J. Manon S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Kissova I. Polcic P. Kempna P. Zeman I. Sabova L. Kolarov J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Concerning the conformational changes underlying the interaction of BAX with mitochondria, the role of the N-terminal end as an ART sequence was confirmed by studies in yeast; like in mammalian cells, the deletion of the first 19 residues of BAX led to a protein having a strong ability to bind to mitochondria and to release cytochrome c (13Cartron P.F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31Priault M. Cartron P.F. Camougrand N. Antonsson B. Vallette F.M. Manon S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). There were discrepancies raised when the role of the α9 was challenged. Expression of an α9-truncated variant in yeast had strictly the same effect as the parental protein BAX-c-Myc (32Priault M. Camougrand N. Chaudhuri B. Manon S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because this could have been a side effect of the c-Myc tag, untagged proteins were assayed. Most surprisingly, although the full-length untagged protein had a poor effect in yeast, the α9-truncated variant remained very efficient in binding to mitochondria, releasing cytochrome c and inducing cell death (31Priault M. Cartron P.F. Camougrand N. Antonsson B. Vallette F.M. Manon S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Two conclusions could be drawn: 1) addition of a (hydrophilic) c-Myc tag increased the efficiency of the protein in yeast; 2) deletion of the α9-helix also increased the efficiency of the protein in yeast. This observation is not linked to the heterologous expression in yeast; deletion of the α9-helix was shown to increase mitochondrial binding and pro-apoptotic activity in glioma cells almost deprived of endogenous BAX (12Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This work investigates further the molecular mechanisms involved in BAX/mitochondria interactions by expressing variants of BAX carrying residue substitutions in the ART sequence or in the vicinity of the α9-helix in yeast. The crucial role of a conformational change of the ART sequence was confirmed, and the data strongly support the hypothesis that α9 is not required for membrane insertion but, on the opposite, is a second ART sequence. In addition, it is shown that helix α9 is required for the interaction of BAX with anti-apoptotic BCL-xL. BAX Variants and BCL-xL—The mutations in BAX variants and the corresponding mutagenic oligonucleotides are listed in Table I. The BAX gene is a chemically synthesized gene, corresponding to the cDNA of human BAX, but carrying substitutions at the third position of several codons to improve expression in yeast (22Greenhalf W. Stephan C. Chaudhuri B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The mutations were introduced by PCR as described previously (31Priault M. Cartron P.F. Camougrand N. Antonsson B. Vallette F.M. Manon S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). All genes were entirely sequenced on each strand to verify that additional mutations had not been introduced by the PCR amplification. The genes were introduced in the pYES3 (TRP1 marker) vector (Invitrogen), allowing the regulated expression of the proteins under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter GAL1/10. The cDNA of human BCL-xL was introduced in the pDP83A (URA3 marker) under the control of the same GAL1/10 promoter (32Priault M. Camougrand N. Chaudhuri B. Manon S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The construction of BAXΨ and BAXΔhα9, corresponding to deletions of the 19 N-terminal residues or 20 C-terminal residues, respectively, has been described previously (31Priault M. Cartron P.F. Camougrand N. Antonsson B. Vallette F.M. Manon S.

This strain has the advantage of supporting a vigorous oxidative metabolism, thus providing well differentiated mitochondria. Cells were grown aerobically in a synthetic minimal medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.1% potassium phosphate, 0.2% Drop-Mix, 0.02% auxotrophic requirements) supplemented with 2% dl-lactate as a strictly nonfermentable carbon source. Cultures were grown at 28 °C until they reached an absorbance of 0.5 at 550 nm (early exponential growth phase). Then 2% galactose was added to trigger the expression of BAX, and cultures were grown for an additional 14 h. The different variants of BAX were all expressed at high levels showing that the mutations did not strongly decrease BAX synthesis and stability (Fig. 1). Mitochondria Preparation—Cells grown as above were harvested and converted to spheroplasts by a zymolyase treatment (ICN). Spheroplasts were disrupted by an osmotic shock and a hand-potter homogenization to preserve the outer mitochondrial membrane, and the mitochondrial fraction was recovered after a series of differential centrifugation (33Law R.H. Manon S. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Where indicated, mitochondria were incubated (1 mg·ml-1) in the presence of 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 11.0) or 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 15 min at 105,000 × g, and the pellet was treated by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—50 μg of mitochondrial proteins (treated or not with Na2CO3 or Triton X-100) were solubilized in 0.1 m Tris/HCl (pH 8.8), 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.004% bromphenol blue, heated for 15 min at 65 °C, and loaded on a SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide/bisacrylamide 30:0.8). After blotting on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Problott, Applied Biosystems), they were incubated with anti-BAX antibody N20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) used at 1:2000 dilution. Anti-BAX antibody BAXΔC21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500 dilution; directed against the C-terminally truncated mouse BAX, but which also recognizes human BAX) was used to detect the BAXΨ isoform, in comparison to the BAXα isoform. Secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibodies coupled to peroxidase (The Jackson Laboratories) were used at a 1:5000 dilution. An anti-yeast porin monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes; 1:10,000) was used as a loading control. An anti-BCL-x antibody (Calbiochem) was used at a 1:500 dilution to verify the expression of this protein after transformation with the plasmids and galactose-driven induction. Peroxidase activity was revealed with ECL+ (Amersham Biosciences), and films at different time exposures were scanned (HP Scanjet 3500c) and quantified with ImageJ software. Cytochrome Content—Mitochondria suspension (5 mg of protein/ml) was divided into the two cuvettes of a dual-beam spectrophotometer (Aminco DW2000). The reference cuvette was oxidized with potassium ferricyanide, and the sample cuvette was reduced with sodium dithionite. Spectra were acquired between 500 and 650 nm allowing us to measure all three mitochondrial cytochromes c, b, and aa3 (see Fig. 4A for typical recordings) The concentration of cytochromes was calculated from the spectra at 550–540 nm (Δϵ = 18,000 m-1·cm-1) for cytochrome c, 561–575 nm (Δϵ = 18,000 m- nm (Δϵ = 24,000 m-1·cm-1) for cytochrome b, and 603–630 1·cm-1) for cytochrome aa3, respectively. The advantage of this method is that cytochrome b, which is a membrane protein, is not released nor degraded (34Manon S. Priault M. Camougrand N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1314-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and serves as an internal control to the experiment. Mutations in the N-terminal ART Sequence—The deletion of the 19 N-terminal residues of BAX (containing the ART sequence) results in an increased binding of BAX to mammalian mitochondria in vitro (12Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Accordingly, a BAX-GFP fusion protein deprived from the first 17 residues of BAX exhibits a stronger mitochondrial localization in vivo than the full-length BAX-GFP fusion (8Wolter K.G. Hsu Y.T. Smith C.L. Nechushtan A. Xi X.G. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1281-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Moreover, high level expression of an N-terminally truncated isoform of BAX (termed BAXΨ) results in a higher apoptotic efficiency than the expression of the full-length protein in glioma cells (12Cartron P.F. Moreau C. Oliver L. Mayat E. Meflah K. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Cartron P.F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The ART sequence contains a remarkable motif PRGGGP between positions 13 and 18. The RGGG residues are predicted to rotate freely in every direction between the two rigid angles formed by the proline residues. Data obtained by Suzuki et al. (10Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar) showed the very high mobility of ART. A putative movement of ART between two relatively stable positions may be the first event leading to the membrane insertion of BAX, and the PRGGGP sequence is a good candidate to be mainly responsible for such a movement. To test this hypothesis, a double substitution P8G/P13G was created, which was expected to increase the mobility of this zone. The gene encoding this BAX variant was introduced in yeast, under the control of a GAL1/10 promoter. Cells were grown aerobically on a nonfermentable carbon source (lactate) until early exponential growth phase (A550 nm = 0.5). These conditions ensured an optimal differentiation state of mitochondria. 2% galactose was added to trigger the induction of BAX variant, which was done for 14 h. Mitochondria were isolated from zymolyase-treated cells. The amount of BAX variant addressed to mitochondria was measured by Western blotting, the degree of insertion was measured following treatments of mitochondria with Na2CO3 or Triton X-100, and the extent of cytochrome c release was measured by redox differential spectrometry. Full-length BAX (isoform BAXα) and the protein having a deletion of the first 19 residues containing the ART sequence (corresponding to the isoform BAXΨ) were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. An additional negative control was provided by a triple substitution of the glycine residues 10–12 by bigger and more hydrophobic residues (G10V/G11W/G12V). The proline-to-glycine substitutions at positions 8 and 13 generate a protein that exhibits a high binding capacity to mitochondria (Fig. 2). The protein was not released by Na2CO3 treatment but was solubilized by Triton X-100 (Fig. 3), as expected from a protein inserted in the membrane. This insertion correlates with a high capacity to release cytochrome c (Fig. 4). The properties of the P8G/P13G mutant are more or less the same as those of the BAXΨ isoform, suggesting that the higher mobility imposed to ART has the same stimulating effect as the full deletion of this part of the protein.Fig. 3BAX mutants are inserted in mitochondrial membrane. Mitochondria isolated from cells expressing different BAX mutants, alone or in combination with BCL-xL, were treated with Na2CO3 or Triton X-100 to remove loosely bound or inserted proteins, respectively. All the mutants are insensitive to Na2CO3 and sensitive to Triton X-100, showing that they are actually inserted in the membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mutations at the C-terminal End—The C-terminal end of BAX is characterized by the presence of two lysine residues at positions 189 and 190. The presence of lysine (or arginine) residues close to the end of the protein is a characteristic of nearly all BCL-2 family members, whether they are pro- or anti-apoptotic, including nonmammalian protein like worm Ced-9 or viral BHRF1 and ORF16 (Fig. 5). Most interestingly, BH3-only members that bear a predicted C-terminal hydrophobic α-helix, like Bim and Bik, do have positive charges at the end of the protein; this is less obvious for BH3-only members that do not have this predicted hydrophobic α-helix, like Bid and Bad, which do have positive charges, but less close to the C terminus. In order to challenge a role of this conserved characteristics in BAX function, the two positively charged lysine residues were substituted by hydrophobic methionine residues or by negatively charged glutamate residues. Full-length BAXα and the protein deprived from the 20 residues corresponding to helix α9 and the C-terminal end (BAXΔhα9) served as negative and positive controls, respectively. The K189M/K190M mutant exhibits a marginal binding to mitochondria, close to that of wild-type BAX, and no ability to release cytochrome c (Figs. 2 and 4). On the opposite, the K189E/K190E mutant has a high binding capacity to mitochondria, is inserted into the membrane, and has a high cytochrome c-release activity (Figs. 2, 3, 4), showing that the replacement of the two positive charges by negative charges strongly amplifies both the binding capacity and the activity of BAX. The properties of mutant K189E/K190E are not significantly different from that of the mutant deprived of helix α9, showing that the replacement of the two positive charges by two negative charges has the same effect on BAX/mitochondria interaction as the complete suppression of the last 20 residues. Mutations in the α9-Helix—Nearly all BCL-2 family members have a predicted hydrophobic α-helix localized near the C-terminal end. In the case of anti-apoptotic proteins, like BCL-2 and BCL-xL, the role of this hydrophobic α-helix as a membrane anchor has been demonstrated; deletion of this zone prevents both the membrane insertion and the anti-apoptotic activity of these proteins. A similar observation has been made in yeast; opposite the full-length proteins, BCL-2ΔC and BCL-xLΔC have no ability to protect yeast against the effects of BAX-c-Myc (23Clow A. Greenhalf W. Chaudhuri B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 32Priault M. Camougrand N. Chaudhuri B. Manon S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The function of the hydrophobic α-helix of BAX is far less clear. The helix alone is able to drive the membrane insertion of a reporter protein (16Martinez-Senac M. Corbalan-Garcia S. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9983-9992Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but this behavior may be expected from any hydrophobic α-helix having this length. Despite the lack of clear evidence, it is generally considered that, like for anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members, the hydrophobic helix of BAX is at least a membrane anchor and at best a mitochondria-targeting sequence. Data obtained in yeast did not confirm this hypothesis (31Priault M. Cartron P.F. Camougrand N. Antonsson B. Vallette F.M. Manon S. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Deletion of the α9-helix strongly increased both mitochondria binding and cytochrome c release. Replacement of the helix by a hydrophilic sequence without an obvious predicted secondary structure also increased mitochondria binding and release. Finally, replacement of BAX α9-helix by the homologous sequence of BCL-xL (α8, a true membrane targeting sequence) resulted in strong binding but no cytochrome c release. Similar data were reported in mammalian cells for the deletion and the replacement of BAX-α9 by BCL-xL-α8 (35Oliver L. Priault M. Tremblais K. Le Cabellec M.T. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), in contradiction with previous data obtained with BAX-GFP fusion protein. To gain a better understanding of the role of BAX-α9, a T174D substitution was built, resulting in the introduction of a negative charge facing the core of the protein. A F176S/V180D/A183D triple substitution, introducing hydrophilic residues and two negative charges on the opposite side of the helix (Fig. 6) predicted to face the aqueous environment in the cytosolic structure (10Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), was used as a negative control. This triple substitution resulted in a protein having an identical residual binding as full-length BAXα and no cytochrome c release activity (Figs. 2 and 4). On the opposite, the T174D mutant exhibited a strong binding to mitochondria (Fig. 2), is inserted (Fig. 3), and has a high capacity to release cytochrome c (Fig. 4).

A large number of mutations in the opsin gene associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa have been identified. The naturally occurring T4R opsin mutation in the English mastiff dog leads to a progressive retinal degeneration that closely resembles human retinitis pigmentosa caused by the T4K mutation in the opsin gene. Using genetic approaches and biochemical assays, we explored the properties of the T4R mutant protein. Employing immunoaffinity-purified Rho from affected RHOT4R/T4R dog retina, we found that the mutation abolished glycosylation at Asn2, whereas glycosylation at Asn15 was unaffected, and the mutant opsin localized normally to the rod outer segments. Moreover, we found that T4R Rho* lost its chromophore faster as measured by the decay of meta-rhodopsin II and that it was less resistant to heat denaturation. Detergent-solubilized T4R opsin regenerated poorly and interacted abnormally with the G protein transducin (Gt). Structurally, the mutation affected mainly the “plug” at the intradiscal (extracellular) side of Rho, which is possibly responsible for protecting the chromophore from the access of bulk water. The T4R mutation may represent a novel molecular mechanism of degeneration where the unliganded form of the mutant opsin exerts a detrimental effect by losing its structural integrity.

Mutations of the genes encoding Rho are frequently associated with a number of pathological conditions inherited as autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive traits (10Rattner A. Sun H. Nathans J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 89-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), classified into different classes based on biochemical properties (11Kaushal S. Khorana H.G.

The type of inheritance implies a strategy for potential intervention. For example, constitutive activity of K296E and K296M opsin mutants can be silenced by the addition of retinylamine analog inhibitors (13Yang T. Snider B.B. Oprian D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The prediction is that such a mutation will prevent the glycosylation at Asn2, one of the two glycosylation sites in opsin.

Tunicamycin, which inhibits the biosynthesis of N-acetylglucosaminylpyrophosphorylpolyisoprenol and thus prevents the formation of the Asn-linked oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, blocks the glycosylation of opsin in vitro, but only slightly decreases the polypeptide synthesis and intracellular transport of opsin (18Fliesler S.J.

When expressed in a heterologous system, the T4K mutant displays increased mobility in SDS-PAGE experiments, suggesting that one or both sites (Asn2 and/or Asn15) have not been glycosylated. The T4K mutant also regenerates poorly with 11-cis-retinal and displays low light-dependent activation of the rod photoreceptor G protein transducin (Gt) (11Kaushal S. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6121-6128Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The N2Q mutant has normal properties, whereas non-glycosylated Rho is ineffective in the G protein activation assay (19Kaushal S. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cideciyan A.V. Aleman T.S. Pianta M.J. Pearce-Kelling S.E. Miller B.J. Jacobson S.G. Aguirre G.D. Acland G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We conclude that mutation of opsin within the intradiscal region affects the stability of the protein and the regeneration of mutant Rho, but not its spectral properties. This study reveals that the molecule responsible for the retinal degeneration is opsin, suggesting yet another molecular mechanism for retinal degeneration.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—All dogs (3-9 months old) studied were from a research colony of mixed-breed dogs maintained at the Retinal Disease Studies Facility (Kennett Square, PA). RHOT4R/+ and RHOT4R/T4R dogs derive their mutant RHO allele from English mastiff dogs affected with autosomal dominant progressive retinal atrophy as described previously (22Kijas J.W. Cideciyan A.V.

RPE65-/- and RPE65+/- dogs derive their mutant allele, a 4-bp deletion in the canine RPE65 (retinal pigment epithelium protein of 65 kDa) gene, from a briard dog affected with the canine homolog of Leber's congenital amaurosis (24Acland G.M.

Vis. 1998; 4: 23-29PubMed Google Scholar) loci as described previously. To produce RHOT4R/+RPE65-/- double mutant dogs, an initial crossbreeding was undertaken between an affected female from the RPE65-/- strain (genotype RHO+/+RPE65-/-) and a heterozygous affected male from the RHOT4R/+ strain (genotype RHOT4R/+RPE65+/+). One of their female progeny genotyped as RHOT4R/+RPE65+/- was then backcrossed to an RPE65-/- male, yielding, among others, RHOT4R/+RPE65-/- double mutant individuals.Whole retinas were dissected from eyes enucleated immediately postmortem from dogs that had been dark-adapted for at least 15 h. The retinas were then immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and maintained under cryogenic conditions until analyzed. All such procedures were undertaken under dim red illumination.Materials—11-cis-Retinal was a gift from Dr. R. K.

The hexyl-agarose resin was purchased from MP Biomedicals Inc. (Aurora, OH). Other resins and columns for chromatography were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.Purification of Rho—Purified anti-Rho C terminus antibody 1D4 (26Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) was immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (27Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and a 4.6 × 12-mm column was packed with 2 mg of antibody 1D4/ml of Sepharose beads. All procedures employing Rho or retinoids were performed under dim red light unless mentioned otherwise. The dog retinas were homogenized in buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.5) with a glass-to-glass homogenizer. Soluble proteins in the supernatant were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was then solubilized in buffer containing 1% DM, 10 mm bis-tris propane, and 500 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). After centrifugation at 125,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was loaded onto the antibody 1D4-packed immunoaffinity column, followed by thorough washing with buffer A (0.1% DM, 10 mm bis-tris propane, and 500 mm NaCl (pH 7.5)) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Finally, purified dog Rho was eluted with 100 μm nonapeptide (TETSQVAPA) in buffer A at room temperature. The purified Rho concentration was determined using a Hewlett-Packard 8452A UV-visible spectrophotometer.Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Protein separation was performed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Coomassie Blue R-250 staining, silver staining, and immunoblotting (Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride, Millipore Corp.) were carried out according to standard protocols. Antibodies 1D4 (26Molday R.S. MacKenzie D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and B6-30N (28Adamus G. Zam Z.S. Arendt A. Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Vision Res. 1991; 31: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) were used to detect the corresponding C-terminal and N-terminal epitopes. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) was used as a secondary antibody. Protein bands were visualized with the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium color development substrate (Promega).Deglycosylation of Rho—Peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs Inc.) was used for the Rho deglycosylation experiments. In brief, ∼20 μg of immunoaffinity-purified Rho was first denatured (according to the manufacturer's protocol) and incubated with 100 units of peptide N-glycosidase F at 37 °C for 14 h. Because deglycosylated Rho has a faster mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (21Plantner J.J. Poncz L. Kean E.L. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 201: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the samples were then immunoblotted with antibody 1D4 to confirm the completion of deglycosylation.Quantification and Stability of Rho—Quantification of dog Rho was carried out spectrophotometrically. Whole dog retinas were homogenized with a glass-to-glass homogenizer. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, the pellet was solubilized in buffer containing 1% DM, 10 mm bis-tris propane, and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). The solubilized mixture was centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 20 min, and one-fourth of the supernatant was used for quantification of the Rho concentration by UV-visible spectroscopy. In the stability experiments, UV-visible absorption spectra of freshly purified Rho samples were measured at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 20 mm NH2OH (pH 7.0). The absorbance was recorded at 504 nm until it dropped below 30% of the initial reading. Standard deviations were calculated from three sets of data from parallel experiments.Retinoid Analysis—Retinoids were extracted and derivatized as described previously (29Van Hooser J.P. Liang Y. Maeda T. Kuksa V. Jang G-F. He Y.G. Rieke F. Fong H.K. Detwiler P.B. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Samples were analyzed by normal-phase HPLC (Beckman Ultrasphere-Si HP1100 column, 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) using an isocratic solvent system consisting of 0.5% (v/v) ethyl acetate in hexane for 15 min, followed by 4% ethyl acetate in hexane for 60 min at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min at 20 °C. The diode array UV-visible detector was set at 325 nm. Data were analyzed with Hewlett-Packard Chemstation A.06.03 software.Isolation of N-terminal Peptides for Mass Spectrometry Analysis— Immunoaffinity-purified dog T4R Rho was desalted with a D-Salt™ dextran desalting column (Pierce), and the original buffer was replaced with 50 mm NH4HCO3 (adjusted to pH 7.5). The fractions containing the majority of Rho were concentrated by lyophilization before SDS-PAGE analysis. After electrophoresis, the gel was first fixed with a solution of 50% EtOH and 10% AcOH for 1-2 h and then washed overnight with a solution of 50% MeOH and 10% AcOH. The washed gel was stained with a mixture of 0.02% Coomassie Blue R-250, 20% MeOH, and 10% AcOH and then destained with a solution of 50% MeOH and 10% AcOH. The protein bands corresponding to T4R Rho (∼5 μg in total) were excised into small pieces (∼1 × 1 × 1 mm3) and extensively washed with a solution of 50% MeOH and 5% AcOH. After being dehydrated with CH3CN and dried in a SpeedVac, the gel pieces were treated for 40 min with 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 40 °C. The solution was removed, and the gel pieces were rinsed with 50 mm NH4HCO3, dehydrated with CH3CN, and dried again. The dried gel pieces were alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm NH4HCO3 for 40 min in the dark at 40 °C. After removal of the solution, the gel pieces were incubated with two rounds of 50 mm NH4HCO3 at room temperature for 10 min each time. Finally, the gel pieces were dehydrated with CH3CN and digested for 24 h with 0.5 μg of trypsin in 100 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 37 °C. To extract the digested peptides, the solution was removed, and the digested gel pieces were incubated with another 100 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 at room temperature for 10 min. The incubation was repeated with two rounds of 50% CH3CN and 5% AcOH and two rounds of 93% CH3CN and 5% AcOH. The extracts were pooled, dried in a SpeedVac, and dissolved in 20 μl of solvent A (1% CH3CN and 0.2% AcOH) for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. In a parallel experiment, 10 μg (7.5 nmol) of the synthetic N-terminal T4R Rho peptide Ac-MNGREGPNFYV was digested with 0.4 μg of trypsin in 20 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 at 37 °C for 18 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.8 μl of AcOH, and the resulting mixture was dried in a SpeedVac and dissolved in solvent A to a final peptide concentration of 1 μm for LC-MS/MS analysis.Mass Spectrometry—Analysis of the tryptic N-terminal peptide Ac-MNGR (MH1+, m/z 519.2354) was performed by microcolumn electrospray LC-MS/MS. The mass spectrometer (PE-Sciex API QSTAR PULSAR i Q-TOF) was coupled with a nebulization-assisted electrospray ionization source (PE-Sciex). The house-made microcolumn (250 μm × 15 cm) was prepared from fused silica tubing packed with Zorbax SB-C18 (4 μm, 80 Å) using an inline microfilter as the column outlet frit. An Agilent 1100 series HPLC capillary pump was used to deliver a flow rate of 4 μl/min with a gradient of 100% solvent A (0.2% AcOH) and 0% solvent B (90% CH3CN and 0.2% AcOH) for 18 min and then gradually to 0% solvent A and 100% solvent B for another 50 min. Throughout the gradient, the mass spectrometer was programmed to monitor m/z in the range of 500-550 with a +1 charge only, followed by MS/MS (unit resolution) with three different preset values of collisional energy for each selected precursor ion. Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments.Photosensitivity and Regeneration of the Visual Pigment—UV-visible absorption spectra of freshly purified dog Rho were first measured at 20 °C. The samples were then bleached at a 20-cm distance (to avoid overheating the sample) with a 60-watt light bulb for 10, 20, 30, and 300 s. Alternative bleaching was done using a long-pass wavelength filter (>490 nm). The results were comparable under both bleaching conditions. The UV-visible absorption spectra of the bleached samples were immediately measured after each bleaching. In the experiments without NH2OH, H2SO4 was added after bleaching the sample for 5 min to adjust the final pH to 1.9 to trap the retinylidene Lys296. In another set of experiments, neutral NH2OH was added to reach a final concentration of 20 mm before any bleaching was conducted. In the regeneration experiments, ∼10 μg of wild-type (WT) or T4R Rho solubilized in 1% DM or 2% digitonin was bleached thoroughly for 2 min with a Fiber-Lite illuminator at a distance of 15 cm. Next, 11-cis-retinal was added under dim red light, and the formation of Rho was measured immediately afterward. The final ratio of 11-cis-retinal to Rho was 50:1, which enabled fitting of the data to a pseudo first-order reaction (PWT < 0.0001, PT4R < 0.0008). The rate constants calculated for dog WT and T4R Rho were 0.00029 and 0.00001 s-1, respectively.Limited Proteolysis—Freshly purified dog WT and T4R Rho were quantified by UV-visible spectroscopy. Half of the samples were bleached by illumination with a Fiber-Lite illuminator for 5 min at room temperature in the presence of 20 mm neutral NH2OH. Both Rho and the bleached opsin samples were digested at a 200:1 molar ratio of Rho to tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Worthington) in buffer containing 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, and 1.8 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.5) for 5, 15, 30, or 45 min. The digestion was terminated by the addition of denaturing loading buffer (350 mm Tris-HCl, 350 mm SDS, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 600 mm dithiothreitol, and 175 μm bromphenol blue), and the resulting mixture was immediately used for SDS-PAGE or immunoblot analysis.Rates of meta-Rhodopsin II (Meta II) Decay—All measurements were performed with 0.1 nm dog Rho in a solution of 0.1% DM, 10 bis-tris propane, and 100 mm NaCl (pH 6.0), favoring the formation of Meta II. A PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B luminescence spectrophotometer was used to measure the increase in intrinsic Trp fluorescence due to hydrolysis of the protonated Schiff base and release of all-trans-retinal from Rho (32Farrens D.L.

Immunoaffinity-purified Rho was bleached with a Fiber-Lite illuminator for 15 s from a distance of 15 cm, immediately followed by fluorescence measurements. A thermostat was applied to stabilize the temperature of the cuvette at 20 °C during the measurement. Fluorometer slit settings were 2.5 μm at 295 nm for excitation and 8 μm at 330 nm for emission. Both fitted curves have R2 values >0.99.Purification of Gt—Gt was extracted from fresh bovine rod outer segment (ROS) membranes. ROS from 200 bovine retinas were homogenized in 80 ml of ice-cold water. The membrane suspension was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was collected. This extraction was repeated twice. The combined supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 30 min to remove ROS membrane contamination. The final supernatant was adjusted to contain 10 mm MOPS, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm benzamidine (pH 7.5). This solution was then loaded onto hexyl-agarose resin (10 × 55 mm) equilibrated with buffer containing 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm benzamidine. Bound proteins were eluted by stepwise addition of 75 mm NaCl and then 300 mm NaCl in the equilibration buffer. Fractions eluted with 300 mm NaCl, containing Gt and phosphodiesterase, were dialyzed into 10 mm bis-tris propane, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm benzamidine and used for preparing Rho*-Gt complexes. For the Gt activity assay, this protein was further separated from phosphodiesterase by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (10 × 300 mm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm bis-tris propane (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT (pH 7.5).Gt Binding and Activation Assays—In the binding assay, affinity-purified dog Rho (WT or T4R mutant) was mixed with an equivalent amount of Gt in 10 mm bis-tris propane (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm DM and then bleached and incubated for 15 min on ice to form the complex. To observe Gt dissociation in the other group of experiments, equivalent amounts of Gt and opsin were incubated in the same buffer with 100 μm GTPγS on ice for 30 min under room light before loading onto a size exclusion column. This chromatography was performed on a Superdex 200 10/300 GL column (10 × 300 mm) at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min using 10 mm bis-tris propane (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 1 mm DTT. The protein concentration of each fraction was determined with a Cary 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Walnut Creek, CA), and the fractions were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above.In the fluorescence assay of Gt activation, the ratio of Gt to Rho was ∼10:1, with Gt at a concentration of 250 nm and Rho at 25 nm, within the linear"

In the case of Dpl, overlapping deletions defined a requirement for the gene interval encoding helices B and B′ (DplΔ101–125). These data suggest contributions of copper binding and neuronal trafficking to wt PrPC function in vivo and place constraints upon current hypotheses to explain Dpl/PrPC antagonism by competitive ligand binding.

In the case of prion infections, it is well accepted that a profound structural remodeling involving a templated conformational change culminates in the formation of protease-resistant and infectivity-associated forms of the prion protein commonly denoted as PrPSc. In the case of inherited prion diseases such as familial Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease, insertional or missense mutations in the human PrP gene (PRNP, denoted Prnp in the mice) result in abnormal forms of PrPC that may, in some instances, misfold and accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, insights into the normal function of PrPC, and the extent to which conformational alterations might participate in this function, have proven hard to come by because of difficulties in connecting in vitro and in vivo data. For example, in vitro protein binding partners have proven difficult to authenticate by in vivo genetic analyses, and conversely, in vivo genetic analyses of PrPC have been limited to defining determinants required for prion replication and binding to an as yet uncloned partner protein designated protein X (2Telling G.C.

Mutagenic PCRs were digested with restriction enzyme DpnI (target sequence, 5′-Gm6ATC-3′), specific for methylated and hemi-methylated DNA, in order to eliminate parental DNA template. Products were then transformed into Escherichia coli and verified by sequence analysis using two coding strand and two anti-coding strand sequencing primers. Authenticated mutants were subsequently transferred into pBud.GFP (pBud.CE4 vector, Invitrogen) by standard restriction enzyme cloning for transfection experiments.

To mobilize the Prnp “H/G” allele from a heterologous cloning vector, we used the seamless cloning technique (Stratagene) and primers located in flanking regions of the Prnp coding region (AGTTACTCTTCGGACTGATGTCGGCCTCTGC and AGTTACTCTTCTGCCCCAGCTGCCGCAGCCC). To create the Dpl-GPS1-1 allele, a Doppel cDNA was mutagenized with the transposon-based “GPS” mutagenesis system (New England Biolabs), digested with Pme1 to excise the transposon, and re-ligated to create a 15-bp insert. The position of the resulting 5-amino acid insertion was established by sequencing. The wt Prnp allele used as a basis for mutagenesis was derived from a Prnpa cDNA (32Locht C. Chesebro B. Race R.

After 4 days in vitro, granule cells were transfected in minimum essential medium with 2 μg of pBud-GFP vectors using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 30 min before replacing the media with K25+S. 24 h post-transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. N2a neuroblastoma cells were transfected as described previously (10Moore R. Lee I. Silverman G.S. Harrison P. Strome R. Heinrich C. Karunaratne A. Pasternak S.H. Chishti M.A. Liang Y. Mastrangelo P.

Where described, 20 μm of Ac-DEVD-CHO (Sigma) was added to the cultures after transfection. Measurement of Cell Death—Cell death was quantified by staining the cells with the blue fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342, which stains chromatin. Transfected neurons (GFP-positive) were scored as healthy or apoptotic by morphological criteria (i.e. chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, cytoplasm blebbing, and neuritic degeneration) (37Saudou F.

Each graph represents at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate in which about 150–200 neurons were individually examined using a fluorescent Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope.

For internal staining cells were incubated for 1 min at room temperature in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Cells were then incubated for 30 min in blocking solution (PBS, 2% goat serum) and then overnight in primary antibody (α-Dpl E6977, a gift from S. Prusiner) diluted 1:300 in blocking solution. Cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated in blocking solution for 15 min, and then incubated with the secondary antibody (Cy-3 1:300, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h at room temperature. Monoclonal antibody 7A12 binding between residues 90 and 145 was used (1:300) for immunodetection of PrP (39Li R. Liu T. Wong B.S. Pan T. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. O'Rourke K. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Sy M.S. J. Mol.

Cells were washed three times with PBS and viewed at room temperature with a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope using an Achrostigmat 40×/0.55 LD objective. Pictures were taken with a Kodak Digital camera (DC290) using the Kodak Microscopy Documentation System MDS2900 software for the image acquisition. Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% SDS and assayed for total protein using the BCA assay (Pierce). 50 μg protein samples were loaded on Tris-glycine SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. For immunoblotting, membrane was incubated with the polyclonal antibody E6977 at 1:4000 overnight, and antibody binding was revealed by using an ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). A Dpl N-terminal peptide antigen corresponding to residues 27–39 was synthesized by solid phase techniques and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. This peptide was covalently linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via a disulfide linkage made possible by the addition of a cysteine residue at the peptide C terminus. A total of three rabbits were immunized with peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin complexes for each peptide antigen and were then subsequently given booster injections at 7-day intervals. Antisera collected for each peptide were pooled, and IgG was precipitated with ammonium sulfate. Antibodies were then affinity-purified with Sulfo-link-agarose (Pierce) coupled with the appropriate peptide. This final purification is required to remove nonspecific interactions of other antibodies present in either in the pre- or post-immune serum. A Transgene-based Assay for Dpl Toxicity—Based upon susceptibility to toxicity engendered by Dpl and mutant PrP transgenes in vivo (as well as the results presented below), we first investigated primary cerebellar granule cell cultures to evaluate the toxic action of recombinant proteins. However, a failure to recapitulate the protective effect of endogenous PrPC, as well as the high (micromolar) concentrations of recombinant Dpl required to induce apoptotic cell death (not shown), suggested an exploration of alternative paradigms. The availability of Dpl and PrP alleles assessed previously in Tg mice provided the impetus to develop a gene-based bioassay. To obviate biohazard issues arising from the use of viral vectors to express mammalian prion and prion-like genes, we developed a protocol based upon delivery of naked DNA. In this transient transfection system, primary cultures of granule neurons were transfected with bigenic expression plasmids by a liposome-based method. In this way it was possible to obtain simultaneous expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to denote the subset of cells successfully transfected (and thereby expressing the Prnd alleles under study), without recourse to use the GFP-prion protein fusions of undefined biological activity. Accordingly, pBud-CE4 bigenic vectors were used to clone a variety of Prnd alleles (all with identical 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences) and GFP genes under the control of two different promoters (cytomegalovirus and EF-1α, respectively). These plasmids were then used to transfect post-mitotic primary cerebellar granule cells at postnatal day 10 or 11, 4 days after culturing in vitro (“DIV 4”). Cerebellar neuronal cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with the DNA dye Hoechst 44333 to visualize nuclear morphology 24 h following transfection. Transfected neurons were obtained at a frequency between 1 and 2%, as analyzed by fluorescence microscopy for GFP expression, and were scored without knowledge of plasmid genotype for signs of cellular death. We found that a population of granule cells transfected with wt Doppel showed a 2-fold elevated level of apoptotic death above empty vector controls, as indicated by nuclear morphology visualized with Hoechst stain (Fig. 1A) (37Saudou F.

Over 94% of the green fluorescent neurons also exhibited cell-surface immunofluorescence with the anti-Doppel antibody (Fig. 2). Taken together, these data suggest that Doppel transgene expression in cerebellar granule cells induces cell death.Fig. 2A high percentage of GFP-positive neurons also express Doppel after transfection with bigenic vectors.

However, the identity of the platelet surface receptor for LDL is unknown. We have previously reported that binding of the LDL component apolipoprotein B100 to platelets induces rapid phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK). Here, we show that LDL-dependent activation of this kinase is inhibited by receptor-associated protein (RAP), an inhibitor of members of the LDL receptor family. Confocal microscopy revealed a high degree of co-localization of LDL and a splice variant of the LDL receptor family member apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (apoER2′) at the platelet surface, suggesting that apoER2′ may contribute to LDL-induced platelet signaling. Indeed, LDL was unable to induce p38MAPK activation in platelets of apoER2-deficient mice. Furthermore, LDL bound efficiently to soluble apoER2′, and the transient LDL-induced activation of p38MAPK was mimicked by an anti-apoER2 antibody. Association of LDL to platelets resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of apoER2′, a process that was inhibited in the presence of PP1, an inhibitor of Src-like tyrosine kinases. Moreover, phosphorylated but not native apoER2′ co-precipitated with the Src family member Fgr. This suggests that exposure of platelets to LDL induces association of apoER2′ to Fgr, a kinase that is able to activate p38MAPK.

Platelets and low density lipoproteins (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; apoB100, apolipoprotein B100; apoER2, apolipoprotein E receptor-2; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FAK, p125 focal adhesion kinase; GFP, gel-filtered platelets; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LDL-R, LDL receptor; LRP1, LDL receptor-related protein-1; p38MAPK, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PECAM-1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1; PGI2, prostacyclin; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; RAP, receptor-associated protein, SPR, surface plasmon resonance; SR-A, scavenger receptor A; SR-BI, scavenger receptor BI; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. are key elements in the development of atherothrombotic complications. The interplay between both elements is apparent from the notion that LDL particles markedly enhance the responsiveness of platelets to various aggregation-inducing agents (1Surya I.I. Gorter G.

These agonists mediate the release of growth factors, vasoactive substances, and chemotactic agents that are known to stimulate atherosclerotic plaque formation. Sensitization of platelets by LDL involves the major LDL constituent apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) (5Relou I.A.M. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J.M. Akkerman J.W.N. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 87: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a 4563 amino acid protein that is wrapped around the LDL particle (6Chatterton J.E. Phillips M.L. Curtiss L.K. Milne R. Fruchart J.C. Schumaker V.N. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2027-2037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL particles are recognized by the classical hepatic LDL receptor (LDL-R) through the apoB100 moiety, and in particular through a region within the apoB100 protein that is enriched in positively charged amino acids, the so-called B-site (7Boren J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Like LDL, a synthetic peptide mimicking this B-site associates to the platelet surface (5Relou I.A.M. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J.M. Akkerman J.W.N. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 87: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, this peptide interferes with binding of LDL to platelets (5Relou I.A.M. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J.M. Akkerman J.W.N. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 87: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that both elements share similar binding sites. This possibility is supported by the observation that binding of either LDL or the B-site peptide to the platelet results in a near immediate activation of the intracellular enzyme p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) (5Relou I.A.M. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J.M. Akkerman J.W.N. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 87: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 8Hackeng C.M. Relou I.A.M. Pladet M.W. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J.M. Akkerman J.W.N. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Activation of this Ser/Thr kinase is associated with downstream phosphorylation and activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2, which leads to the formation of thromboxane A2 (9Kramer R.M. Roberts E.F.

Finally, enhanced platelet function occurs via exposure of the integrin αIIbβ3 and fibrinogen binding (11Hackeng C.M. Huigsloot M. Pladet M.W. Nieuwenhuis H.K. van Rijn H.J.M. Akkerman J.W.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which LDL particles signal to p38MAPK is yet unclear, but it seems conceivable that it involves a receptor-dependent pathway. The finding that the signaling pathway is initiated by the apoB100 component of LDL may point to the involvement of an LDL-binding receptor. However, platelets are known to lack the classical LDL-R as well as LDL receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) (12Pedreno J. de Castellarnau C. Cullare C. Sanchez J. Gomez Gerique J. Ordonez Llanos J.

Trans. 1998; 26: S244Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Recently, a splice variant of apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (apoER2) has been identified in platelets and megakaryocytic cell lines (14Riddell D.R. Vinogradov D.V. Stannard A.K. Chadwick N. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1925-1930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ApoER2, which is also known as LDL receptor-related protein-8, is a member of the LDL receptor family, and is mainly expressed in brain, testes, and vascular cells but not in the liver (15Herz J. Bock H.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 405-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 16Kim D.H. Iijima H. Goto K. Sakai J. Ishii H. Kim H.J. Suzuki H. Kondo H. Saeki S. Yamamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8373-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Its structure is most closely related to the LDL-R and VLDL-R (17Hussain M.M. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D417-D428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, transcriptional analysis has revealed that multiple alternative splicing variants of apoER2 exist (18Korschineck I. Ziegler S.

Biochem. 1999; 262: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), one of which, apoER2′, is present in platelets (14Riddell D.R. Vinogradov D.V. Stannard A.K. Chadwick N. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1925-1930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet apoER2′ mRNA encodes a 130-kDa protein, which consists of a single ligand-binding domain that comprises four complement type A repeats (compared with seven repeats in full-length apoER2), an epidermal growth factor-like homology region, an O-linked sugar domain, and a single transmembrane domain that connects the extracellular region to the cytoplasmic tail. Several studies have shown the ability of apoER2 to bind and internalize apoE-containing lipid vesicles (14Riddell D.R. Vinogradov D.V. Stannard A.K. Chadwick N. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1925-1930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Herz J. Bock H.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 405-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of apoER2 to the general lipid metabolism is probably limited, since mice genetically deficient for apoER2 do not suffer from increased plasma lipoprotein levels (20Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Because also the endocytosis rate of apoER2 is almost 20-fold lower compared with LRP1 (21Li Y. Lu W. Marzolo M.P. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it seems conceivable that apoER2 serves an alternative physiological function as well. Indeed, there is firm support for a role of apoER2 in cellular signaling processes. For example, apoER2 has been reported to contribute to the neuronal signaling pathway that governs the layering of the developing cortex (20Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). In this process, apoER2 functions as a receptor for the signaling molecule reelin, and transmits the reelin signal to the intracellular adaptor protein disabled-1, which associates to the cytoplasmic tail of apoER2 (20Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J.

Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1378-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). This tail contains an ΨXNPXY sequence (where Ψ is a hydrophobic amino acid residue), which may function as a potential binding site for phosphotyrosine binding domains of signaling molecules, including disabled-1. In addition, the cytoplasmic region of apoER2 contains three proline-rich areas that correspond to the consensus sequence (PXXP) for Src homology-3 recognition (14Riddell D.R. Vinogradov D.V. Stannard A.K. Chadwick N. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1925-1930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of these motifs that potentially link apoER2 to various signaling pathways are also present in the platelet variant of this receptor (14Riddell D.R. Vinogradov D.V. Stannard A.K. Chadwick N. Owen J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1925-1930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated whether apoER2′ has the potential to transmit the LDL signal to intracellular signaling components, with particular reference to p38MAPK. We found that LDL bound efficiently to soluble apoER2′ and that an anti-apoER2 antibody was similar to LDL particles in activating p38MAPK. Furthermore, the absence of apoER2 in platelets was associated with a lack of LDL-dependent p38MAPK activation, while inhibition of ligand binding to apoER2′ by the 39 kDa receptor-associated protein (RAP) interfered with LDL-dependent phosphorylation of p38MAPK. Finally, incubation of platelets with LDL particles resulted in a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of apoER2′. This process was mediated by Src-like kinases and allowed the association with the signaling molecule Fgr. In view of our data, we propose that apoER2′ serves a critical role in the LDL-initiated signaling pathway that governs platelets with increased sensitivity toward its aggregation-inducing agents. Mice—Wild-type C57Bl/6 mice and mice genetically deficient for the LDL receptor (LDL-R-/-), CD36 (CD36-/-), scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI-/-), and scavenger receptor A (SR-A-/-) were used in this study. C57Bl/6 mice were obtained from Charles River (Maastricht, The Netherlands). Mice genetically deficient for apoER2 have been described previously (20Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T.

Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared as described previously (31Lenting P.J. Neels J.G. van den Berg B.M. Clijsters P.P. Meijerman D.W. Pannekoek H. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. van Zonneveld A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23734-23739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The peptide RLTRKRGLKLA (Mr = 1311) designated B-site peptide, represents the receptor binding domain within apoB100. The peptide was synthesized by standard solid phase peptide synthesis and purified by C18 reverse-phase chromatography (HPLC, Genosphere biotechnologies, Paris, France). The purity of the peptides was >99% as determined by HPLC, and the molecular weights were verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry by the manufacturer. Preparation of recombinant murine soluble apoER2′ (s-apoER2′) fused to mannose-binding protein was performed as described (32Koch S. Strasser V. Hauser C. Fasching D. Brandes C. Bajari T.M. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5996-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Lipoprotein Isolation—Lipoproteins were isolated as described before (11Hackeng C.M. Huigsloot M. Pladet M.W. Nieuwenhuis H.K. van Rijn H.J.M. Akkerman J.W.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In short, fresh, non-frozen plasma from 3 healthy subjects each containing less than 100 mg of lipoprotein(a)/liter was pooled, and LDL (density range 1.019–1.063 kg/liter) was isolated by sequential flotation in a Beckman L-80 ultracentrifuge (33Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). Centrifugations (175, 000 × g, 20 h, 10 °C) were carried out in the presence of NaN3 and EDTA. The quality of these preparations has been described (11Hackeng C.M. Huigsloot M. Pladet M.W. Nieuwenhuis H.K. van Rijn H.J.M. Akkerman J.W.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins were stored at 4 °C under nitrogen for not longer than 14 days and before each experiment dialyzed overnight against 104 volumes 150 mmol/liter NaCl. ApoB100 and lipoprotein(a) concentrations were measured using the Behring Nephelometer 100. The concentration of LDL was expressed as grams of apoB100 protein/liter. Platelet Isolation—Freshly drawn venous blood from healthy volunteers was collected with informed consent into 0.1 volume 130 mmol/liter trisodium citrate. The donors claimed not to have taken any medication during 2 weeks prior to blood collection. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifugation (200 × g, 15 min, 22 °C). Gel-filtered platelets (GFPs) were isolated by gel filtration through Sepharose 2B equilibrated in Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution (137 mmol/liter NaCl, 2.68 mmol/liter KCl, 0.42 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 1.7 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 11.9 mmol/liter NaHCO3, pH 7.25) containing 0.2% BSA and 5 mmol/liter glucose. GFPs were adjusted to a final count of 2 × 1011 platelets/liter. For the isolation of murine platelets, mice were anesthetized by subcutaneous injection of a mixture of xylazine (5 mg/ml), ketamine (40 mg/liter), and atropine (0.05 mg/ml), and blood was subsequently collected into 0.1 volume of 130 mmol/liter trisodium citrate and 0.1 volume of ACD buffer (2.5 g of trisodium citrate, 1.5 g of citric acid, and 2gof d-glucose in 100 ml of distilled water) by heart puncture. PRP was obtained by centrifugation (87 × g, 15 min, 20 °C). The remainder of the blood was diluted with Hepes-Tyrode buffer (145 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 0.5 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, 1 mmol/liter MgSO4, 10 mmol/liter Hepes, 5 mmol/liter d-glucose, pH 6.5), and 0.1 volume of ACD buffer and centrifuged again (87 × g, 15 min, 20 °C). PRP samples were pooled, and platelets were isolated from PRP by centrifugation (350 × g, 15 min, 20 °C) in the presence of 0.1 volume of ACD buffer and resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode buffer (pH 6.5). PGI2 was added to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml, and the washing procedure was repeated once. The platelet pellet was resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode buffer (pH 7.2). Platelet count was adjusted to 1 × 1011 platelets/liter. p38MAPK Assay—Human GFPs or washed murine platelets were incubated at 37 °C with LDL, anti-apoER2 antibody 186 or anti-LDL-R antibody as indicated. After incubation, 100-μl aliquots were mixed (1:10 v/v) with cold lysis buffer consisting of 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5% (w/v) octylglucoside, 50 mmol/liter EDTA, 1% (w/v) SDS supplemented with 5 mmol/liter NaVO3 and 10% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture and subsequently taken up in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were heated prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred (1 h, 100 volts) to a nitrocellulose membrane using a mini-protean system (Bio-Rad). The blots were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1 h, 4 °C) and incubated with the phosphoplus p38MAPK (recognizing p38MAPK phosphorylated at Thr180 and Tyr182) or p38MAPK antibody, which recognizes both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated isoforms (1:2000 (v/v) in 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.1% (v/v) Tween in PBS, 16 h, 4 °C). Both antibodies are raised against residues 171–186 of human p38MAPK. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit (1:2000 (v/v), 1 h, 4 °C) and p38MAPK was visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. For semi-quantitative determination of the amount of dual phosphorylated or total p38MAPK, the density of the bands was analyzed using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Solid Phase Binding Assay—Microtiter plates were incubated with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 2 mmol/liter CaCl2 containing 10 μg/ml of s-apoER2′ (16 h, 4 °C). After blocking (1 h, 22 °C) in blocking solution (2% BSA in TBS, 2mmol/liter CaCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Tween), wells were incubated with different concentrations of human LDL diluted in blocking solution in the presence or absence of 10 mmol/liter EDTA. Bound LDL was detected by anti-apoB antibody (diluted 1:500 in blocking solution) followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:40,000 in blocking solution). All incubations were carried out at room temperature for 1 h. For the color reaction, a solution of 0.1 mol/liter sodium acetate, pH 6.0 containing 0.1 mg/ml of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine and 10 mmol/liter H2O2 was used. The reaction was stopped after 5 min by the addition of 0.3 mol/liter H2SO4, and bound secondary antibody was photometrically quantified at 450 nm. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding experiments were performed using a Biacore2000 biosensor system. A biotinylated peptide corresponding to the apoB100 B-site was immobilized at a density of 239 fmol/mm2. A control channel was prepared by the immobilization of a biotinylated irrelevant monoclonal antibody. Binding of s-apoER2′ was corrected for binding to this control channel (less than 2%). SPR analysis was performed in 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20, 25 mmol/liter Hepes (pH 7.4) at 25 °C with a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Regeneration of the sensor chip surface was performed by incubating with 10 mmol/liter taurodeoxycholic acid, 100 mmol/liter Tris (pH 9.0) for 2 min. Data were analyzed as described previously (34Horn I.R. van den Berg B.M. Moestrup S.K. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.J. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 80: 822-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). ApoER2′ Tyrosine Phosphorylation—Human GFPs were incubated at 37 °C with LDL or B-site peptide as indicated, mixed with ice-cold lysis buffer (1:10 v/v) as described above and subsequently taken up in Laemmli sample buffer. ApoER2′ was precipitated using a goat polyclonal antibody directed against apoER2 (1 μg/ml) and protein G-Sepharose for3hat4 °C. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer (containing 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/liter NaVO3, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and taken up in non-reducing Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Tyrosine phosphorylation of apoER2′ was visualized by incubation with 4G10, an antibody directed against phosphorylated tyrosine residues (0.5 μg/ml, 16 h, 4 °C), followed by incubation with peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 (v/v), 1 h, 4 °C), and the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. As a control for equal lane loading, the blots were stripped and incubated with a monoclonal anti-α-actinin antibody (1:5000 (v/v), 16 h, 4 °C), followed by incubation with peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 (v/v), 1 h, 4 °C). For semi-quantitative determination of apoER2′ phosphorylation, the density of the bands was analyzed using ImageQuant software. Complex formation between apoER2′ and Src family tyrosine kinases was monitored by immunoprecipitation of apoER2′ from lysates of LDL-stimulated platelets, followed by Western blotting with a polyclonal antibody against c-Fgr (0.4 μg/ml, 16 h, 4 °C), and a subsequent incubation with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000 (v/v), 1 h, 4 °C). Immunofluorescence Studies—Human GFPs were incubated at 37 °C with LDL (1.0 g/liter) in the presence or absence of GST-RAP (0.3 μmol/liter, 10 min). Then, the platelets were applied to coverslips after fixation with 1% (v/v) paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, blocked for 10 min with PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (v/v) glycine (pH 7.4), and incubated with the monoclonal anti-apoB100 2D8 (5Relou I.A.M. Gorter G. van Rijn H.J.M. Akkerman J.W.N. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 87: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and the goat polyclonal anti-apoER2 antibody. Afterward, the coverslips were incubated with a tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (TRITC)-labeled anti-mouse antibody (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-goat antibody, diluted 1:20 (v/v) in PBS for 45 min at 37 °C, followed by washing with PBS. Coverslips were embedded in Mowiol and analyzed by confocal laser microscopy on a Leica confocal laser microscope. Statistics—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. with number of observations n and were analyzed with the Student's t test for unpaired observations. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. LDL-dependent Activation of p38MAPK in the Absence of LDL-R, CD36, SR-BI, or SR-A—LDL-particles are recognized by the classical hepatic LDL-R through the apoB100 moiety (7Boren J. Lee I. Zhu W. Arnold K. Taylor S. Innerarity T.L. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1084-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The scavenger receptors SR-BI and CD36 also bind LDL, in contrast to SR-A that only binds LDL after modification (35Terpstra V. van Amersfoort E.S. van Velzen A.G. Kuiper J. van Berkel T.J.C.

The chick iris was most sensitive to short-wavelength light, demonstrating an action spectrum consistent with cryptochrome rather than with opsin pigments. Pupillary responses did not attenuate after saturating light exposure, but showed paradoxical potentiation. Iris photosensitivity was not affected by retinoid depletion or inhibitors of visual phototransduction. Knockdown of cryptochrome expression, but not of melanopsin expression, decreased iris photosensitivity. These data characterize a non-opsin photoreception mechanism in a vertebrate eye and suggest a conserved photoreceptive role for cryptochromes in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2143937869,"Human keratinocytes undergo apoptosis following treatment with tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) via surface-expressed TRAIL receptors 1 and 2. In addition, TRAIL triggers nonapoptotic signaling pathways including activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, in particular when TRAIL-induced apoptosis is blocked. The intracellular protein cFLIPL interferes with TRAIL-induced apoptosis at the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) in many cell types. To study the role of cFLIPL in TRAIL signaling, we established stable HaCaT keratinocyte cell lines expressing varying levels of cFLIPL. Functional analysis revealed that relative cFLIPL levels correlated with apoptosis resistance to TRAIL. Surprisingly, cFLIPL specifically blocked TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation and TRAIL-dependent induction of the proinflammatory target gene interleukin-8. Biochemical characterization of the signaling pathways involved showed that apoptosis signaling was inhibited at the DISC in cFLIPL-overexpressing keratinocytes, although cFLIPL did not significantly impair enzymatic activity of the receptor complex. In contrast, recruitment and modification of receptor-interacting protein was blocked in cFLIPL-overexpressing cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that cFLIPL is not only a central antiapoptotic modulator of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis but also an inhibitor of TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation and subsequent proinflammatory target gene expression. Hence, cFLIPL modulation in keratinocytes may not only influence apoptosis sensitivity but may also lead to altered death receptor-dependent skin inflammation.

Hence, cFLIPL modulation in keratinocytes may not only influence apoptosis sensitivity but may also lead to altered death receptor-dependent skin inflammation. Apoptosis is a highly regulated physiological process crucial for tissue homeostasis. It is initiated by a multitude of stimuli such as UV irradiation, growth factor deprivation, or chemotherapeutic drugs (1Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Based on the nature of the initiating stimulus, apoptotic signaling pathways have been distinguished as “intrinsic” or “extrinsic” (2Roy S. Nicholson D.W. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: F21-F25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extrinsic pathway is initiated by ligation of so-called death receptors, whose ligands, TNFα, 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; DD, death domain; IL, interleukin; Ab, antibody; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; RIP, receptor-interacting protein. CD95L, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), are members of the TNF superfamily. They have been studied intensively over the past decade, and their role in activation-induced cell death, autoimmune disorders, immune privilege, and tumor evasion from the immune system is now well established (reviewed in Refs. 3Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2950-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 4Ashkenazi A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar, 5Wallach D.

The TRAIL system, consisting of the ligand and four different membrane-bound cellular receptors, has attracted attention for its ability to preferentially kill tumor cells but not normal cells (6MacFarlane M. Toxicol. Lett. 2003; 139: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 7Walczak H. Miller R.E. Ariail K. Gliniak B. Griffith T.S. Kubin M. Chin W. Jones J. Woodward A. Le T. Smith C. Smolak P. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. Schuh J.C. Lynch D.H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2236) Google Scholar). Binding of TRAIL to its receptors TRAIL receptor 1 (TRAIL-R1) and TRAIL-R2 on the cell surface leads to recruitment of adaptor proteins as well as the initiator caspase-8 and -10 to the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). This subsequently results in effector caspase activation and ultimately apoptosis (8Sprick M.R. Walczak H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1644: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). By contrast, TRAIL-R3 lacks a cytoplasmic domain and is bound to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. TRAIL-R4 contains an incomplete death domain (DD) and is also unable to transduce a death signal, although it may have additional yet unknown signaling capabilities (6MacFarlane M. Toxicol. Lett. 2003; 139: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 9Wajant H. Vitam. Horm. 2004; 67: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Whereas most studies have focused on the role of TRAIL as a death ligand, there is evidence that TRAIL-R1, TRAIL-R2, and TRAIL-R4 can also mediate activation of the transcription factor NF-κB. In most cells, TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation is most prominent when cell death pathways are inhibited by the use of peptidyl caspase inhibitors (for a review, see Ref. 9Wajant H. Vitam. Horm. 2004; 67: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition to its potent proinflammatory function, NF-κB has been demonstrated to regulate the transcription of numerous antiapoptotic target genes (10Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). In most cell types, inhibition of NF-κB sensitizes cells to death ligands such as TNFα. In contrast, sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by NF-κB inhibition appears to be cell type-restricted (for a review, see Refs. 9Wajant H. Vitam. Horm. 2004; 67: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and 10Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). Death receptor-mediated apoptosis is effectively inhibited by cFLIP (cellular fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1-β-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein), an intracellular homologue of the initiator caspase-8. Similar to caspase-8, the long form of cFLIP (cFLIPL) contains two amino-terminal death effector domains and a carboxyl-terminal caspase homology domain but lacks enzymatic activity. cFLIPL is recruited to the CD95 and the TRAIL DISC and inhibits full cleavage and release of active caspase-8 and caspase-10 from the DISC (11Thome M. Tschopp J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 12Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Overexpression studies have suggested that in the presence of cFLIPL, additional signaling molecules such as TRAF-1, TRAF-2, receptor-interacting protein (RIP), and RAF-1 are recruited to the DISC, thus explaining how cFLIPL might activate NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways in response to death ligands (13Kataoka T. Budd R.C. Holler N. Thome M. Martinon F. Irmler M. Burns K. Hahne M. Kennedy N. Kovacsovics M. Tschopp J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 640-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Therefore, cFLIPL not only may play a role in apoptosis regulation but may modify other cellular responses, including inflammatory and proliferative signaling pathways of the cell. Keratinocytes express all necessary constituents of the apoptosis machinery and can activate this program following various insults (for a review, see Ref. 14Wehrli P. Viard I. Bullani R. Tschopp J. French L.E. J. Invest Dermatol. 2000; 115: 141-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Pathological modulation of apoptosis signaling in the skin may therefore lead to disorders such as psoriasis, alopecia areata, or skin cancer (for a review, see Refs. 15Weisfelner M.E. Gottlieb A.B. J. Drugs Dermatol. 2003; 2: 385-391PubMed Google Scholar and 16Giannetti L. Consolo U. Magnoni C. Lo M.L. Oncol. Rep. 2004; 11: 401-405PubMed Google Scholar). Several death receptors are expressed in keratinocytes, and a function has been documented for TNF-R1, CD95, TRAIL-R1, or TRAIL-R2. In addition, autocrine apoptosis induction by keratinocyte-derived CD95L has been suggested for toxic epidermal necrolysis (17Viard I. Wehrli P. Bullani R. Schneider P. Holler N. Salomon D. Hunziker T. Saurat J.H. Tschopp J. French L.E. Science. 1998; 282: 490-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The physiological role of TRAIL in the skin remains to be determined. TRAIL was shown to overcome the relative resistance of senescent keratinocytes to apoptosis, and it was suggested that TRAIL may play an important role in epidermal homeostasis (18Qin J.Z. Bacon P.E. Chaturvedi V. Bonish B. Nickoloff B.J. Exp. Dermatol. 2002; 11: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In line with in vivo data (19Bachmann F. Buechner S.A. Wernli M. Strebel S. Erb P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 59-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), TRAIL-resistant primary keratinocytes express high levels of cFLIPL, whereas cells of the highly TRAIL-sensitive transformed keratinocyte line HaCaT only express marginal levels of cFLIPL, suggesting a potential for TRAIL in the treatment of skin neoplasias (20Leverkus M. Neumann M. Mengling T. Rauch C.T. Brocker E.B. Krammer P.H. Walczak H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 553-559PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports have demonstrated that inhibition of caspases fully blocks apoptosis induction after TRAIL stimulation while leading to an increased activation of NF-κB and its target gene, IL-8. These data suggested that gene induction is a distinct apoptosis-independent signal elicited by TRAIL receptors in the skin (21Leverkus M. Sprick M.R. Wachter T. Mengling T. Baumann B. Serfling E. Brocker E.B. Goebeler M. Neumann M. Walczak H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Leverkus M. Sprick M.R. Wachter T. Denk A. Brocker E.B. Walczak H. Neumann M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have thus investigated the impact of cFLIPL expression for TRAIL-mediated apoptotic and nonapoptotic signaling pathways in human keratinocytes. cFLIPL dose-dependently inhibited TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and NF-κB activation at the level of the DISC in keratinocytes. Furthermore, cFLIPL inhibited TRAIL-induced activation of NF-κB as well as induction of target genes such as IL-8 without interfering with the enzymatic activity of the DISC. Rather, cFLIPL overexpression reduced the recruitment of RIP to the DISC as well as its subsequent modification in the DISC. Taken together, our data suggest that cFLIPL acts as an inhibitor of TRAIL-mediated NF-κB activation by directly interfering with RIP recruitment to the DISC. Materials—The following antibodies (Abs) were used: Abs to caspase-8 (C15), cFLIP (NF-6; Alexis, San Diego, California), FADD, IκBα (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), caspase-10 (4C1; MBL International, Watertown, MA), ERK (C-14) and IκBα (C-21) (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), CPP32 (kindly provided by D. W. Nicholson, Merck Frost, Quebec, Canada), RIP (BD Biosciences), and Bid Abs (kindly provided by X. Wang, Howard Hughes Medical Center, Houston, TX). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG Abs were from Pharmingen (Hamburg, Germany), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG2b Abs were obtained from Southern Biotechnology (Birmingham, AL). TRAIL-R1 (HS 101), TRAIL-R2 (HS 201), TRAIL-R3 (HS 301), and TRAIL-R4 (HS 402) monoclonal Abs for FACScan analysis of surface receptor expression were used as described (21Leverkus M. Sprick M.R.

Biol. 2003; 23: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and are available from Alexis (San Diego, CA). Recombinant LZ-TRAIL and FLAG-TRAIL were produced as reported (23Keogh S.A. Walczak H. Bouchier-Hayes L. Martin S.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recombinant human TNFα was obtained from Strathmann Biotech (Hannover, Germany). The protease inhibitor Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) was purchased from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). Cell Culture—The spontaneously transformed keratinocyte line HaCaT was kindly provided by Dr. N. Fusenig (DKFZ; Heidelberg, Germany) and cultured as described (24Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3493) Google Scholar). Retroviral Infection and Generation of HaCaT Cell Lines Stably Expressing cFLIPL—For overexpression of cFLIPL in HaCaT cells, we used the retroviral vector PINCO (kindly provided by Dr. Francisco Grignani) containing cFLIPL cDNA (25Grignani F. Kinsella T. Mencarelli A. Valtieri M. Riganelli D. Grignani F. Lanfrancone L. Peschle C. Nolan G.P. Pelicci P.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 14-19PubMed Google Scholar, 26Stassi G. Di Liberto D. Todaro M.

Retroviral infection of HaCaT cells was essentially performed as described (21Leverkus M. Sprick M.R. Wachter T. Mengling T. Baumann B. Serfling E. Brocker E.B. Goebeler M. Neumann M. Walczak H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Leverkus M. Sprick M.R. Wachter T. Denk A. Brocker E.B. Walczak H. Neumann M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, the amphotrophic producer cell line φNX was transfected with 10 μg of the retroviral vectors by calcium phosphate precipitation. To select transfected producer cells, 2.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) was added to the culture medium for 7–14 days to obtain >95% green fluorescent protein-positive producer cells. Cell culture supernatants containing viral particles were generated by incubation of producer cells with HaCaT medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum) overnight. Following filtration (45-μm filter; Schleicher & Schuell), culture supernatant was added to HaCaT cells seeded in 6-well plates 24 h earlier in the presence of 1 μg/ml Polybrene. HaCaT were centrifuged for 3 h at 21 °C, and the viral particle containing supernatant was subsequently replaced by fresh medium. After an 10–14-day recovery of bulk infected cultures, single cells were seeded in 96-well plates. Successfully infected individual cell clones were identified by green fluorescent protein expression using inverse fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Jena, Germany), and wells containing single cell clones were chosen for further expansion. FACS analysis for green fluorescent protein expression (data not shown) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1) were performed on expanded cell clones to confirm cFLIPL expression. FACScan Analysis—For surface staining of TRAIL receptors (TRAIL-R1 to TRAIL-R4), cells were trypsinized, and 2 × 105 cells were incubated with monoclonal Abs against TRAIL-R1 to TRAIL-R4, or isotype-matched control IgG for 30 min followed by incubation with biotinylated goat anti-mouse secondary Abs and Cy5-phycoerythrin-labeled streptavidin (Caltag, Burlingame, CA) as described (21Leverkus M. Sprick M.R. Wachter T. Mengling T. Baumann B. Serfling E. Brocker E.B. Goebeler M. Neumann M. Walczak H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For all experiments, 104 cells were analyzed by FACScan (BD Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were essentially prepared as described (22Leverkus M. Sprick M.R. Wachter T. Denk A. Brocker E.B. Walczak H. Neumann M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 10–50 μg of total protein were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blocking of membranes and incubation with the indicated primary and appropriate secondary Abs were performed essentially as described elsewhere (21Leverkus M. Sprick M.R. Wachter T. Mengling T.

Terbeck G. Brocker E.B. Kampgen E. Blood. 2000; 96: 2628-2631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bands were visualized with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts of HaCaT keratinocytes as described previously (22Leverkus M. Sprick M.R. Wachter T. Denk A. Brocker E.B. Walczak H. Neumann M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 28Marienfeld R. Berberich-Siebelt F. Berberich I. Denk A. Serfling E. Neumann M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8142-8147Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RNase Protection Assays—Total RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNEasy Kit® according to the manufacturer's recommendation, and 5 μg of total RNA were processed using the Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) RNase protection assay system (hCK-5) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Gels were dried on filter paper and sealed in Saran Wrap, and image data were collected with a phosphor imager (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). IL-8 mRNA expression levels were normalized against L32 mRNA by densitometric analysis. DISC Analysis—For the precipitation of the TRAIL DISC, 5 × 106 HaCaT keratinocytes were used for each condition. Cells were washed once with RPMI medium at 37 °C and subsequently incubated for the indicated time periods at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μg/ml FLAG-TRAIL precomplexed with 2 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) for 15 min or, for the unstimulated control, in the absence of FLAG-TRAIL. DISC formation was stopped by washing the monolayer twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed on ice by the addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at 21 °C, 120 mm NaCl, 10% Glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, Complete® protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). After 15 min of lysis, the lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min to remove cellular debris. DISC complexes were precipitated from the lysates by co-incubation with 20 μl of protein G beads (Roche Applied Science) for 12 h on an end-over-end shaker at 4 °C. For the precipitation of the nonstimulated receptors, 200 ng of FLAG-TRAIL and 400 ng of anti-FLAG M2 were added to the lysates prepared from nonstimulated cells to control for protein association with nonstimulated receptor(s). Ligand affinity precipitates were washed five times with lysis buffer before the protein complexes were eluted from the beads by the addition of 15 μl of 2× standard reducing sample buffer. Subsequently, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8–16% Tris-HCl gradient gels (Bio-Rad) before detection of DISC components by Western blot analysis. Preparation of Recombinant Proteins and in Vitro Cleavage Assay— For the preparation of recombinant Bid, full-length human Bid cDNA was cloned into the pET15a expression vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) and expressed as an N-terminal His fusion protein in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany). Bid was purified from the soluble fraction on Talon-agarose (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Active caspase-8 was produced essentially as described elsewhere (29Koeplinger K.A. Mildner A.M. Leone J.W. Wheeler J.S. Heinrikson R.L. Tomasselli A.G. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 18: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To detect the enzymatic activity of ligand affinity precipitates, the cleavage of recombinant human Bid was monitored. Ligand affinity precipitates from 1.5 × 107 keratinocytes were prepared for each condition as described above. Washed protein complexes were resuspended in 20 μl of CLB buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, 2 mm EDTA, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol), and recombinant Bid (2 ng) was added to the lysates and incubated overnight at 21 °C. As a positive control, recombinant Bid was mixed with different amounts of recombinant caspase-8, whereas Bid alone served as negative control. After 16–24 h, the activity assay was terminated by the addition of loading buffer. Cleavage of Bid to p15/p14 fragments was monitored by Western blot analysis. Apoptosis and Cytotoxicity Assays—Crystal violet staining of attached, living cells was performed 16–24 h after stimulation with different concentrations of LZ-TRAIL (12–1000 ng/ml) in 96-well plates as described (20Leverkus M. Neumann M. Mengling T. Rauch C.T. Brocker E.B. Krammer P.H. Walczak H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 553-559PubMed Google Scholar). Subdiploid DNA content was analyzed as described by Nicoletti et al. (30Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from a 35-mm dish were cultured until reaching 70% confluence and were subsequently stimulated with LZ-TRAIL for 3 h. Cells were then detached, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in buffer N (0.1% (w/v) sodium citrate, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide). Cells were kept in the dark at 4 °C for 48 h, and then diploidity was measured by FACScan analysis. Determination of IL-8 Secretion—IL-8 secretion from keratinocyte cultures was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; R&D Biosystems, Minneapolis, MN) as described (22Leverkus M. Sprick M.R. Wachter T. Denk A. Brocker E.B. Walczak H. Neumann M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 31Leverkus M. Yaar M.

Sensitivity to TRAIL-mediated Apoptosis Correlates with Caspase-8/cFLIPL Ratio in Keratinocytes—cFLIPL is known to inhibit death receptor-mediated apoptosis and is highly overexpressed in primary human keratinocytes when compared with transformed HaCaT keratinocytes (HaCaT) (20Leverkus M. Neumann M. Mengling T. Rauch C.T. Brocker E.B. Krammer P.H. Walczak H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 553-559PubMed Google Scholar). TRAIL has been demonstrated not only to activate an apoptotic program, but also nonapoptotic signals (e.g. via the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB). Activation of NF-κB is enhanced when caspases are pharmacologically inhibited, which excludes the possibility that this signal is solely an epiphenomenon of apoptosis induction (21Leverkus M.

In order to study the impact of caspase inhibition on these different signals in a system that is closer to the physiological situation, we investigated the role of cFLIPL in these signaling pathways. We first established cFLIPL-expressing HaCaT by retroviral transduction. Polyclonal cFLIPL-expressing populations of HaCaT were highly resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis when compared with control-infected cells (Fig. 1, A and B). It was suggested that the ratio of cFLIPL to caspase-8 determines the sensitivity to death receptor-mediated apoptosis (11Thome M. Tschopp J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 12Krueger A. Baumann S. Krammer P.H. Kirchhoff S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8247-8254Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). We therefore established monoclonal cFLIPL-expressing HaCaT subclones. Two control lines and six differentially cFLIPL-expressing lines were identified by Western blotting (Fig. 1C). One control (PI; control), two intermediate (FII and FIV; FLIPlow) and a highly cFLIPL-expressing cell line (FVI; FLIPhigh) were selected for further analysis. In line with our previous report in primary keratinocytes (20Leverkus M. Neumann M. Mengling T. Rauch C.T. Brocker E.B. Krammer P.H. Walczak H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 553-559PubMed Google Scholar), FLIPlow cells were relatively resistant to TRAIL. In contrast, FLIPhigh cells were fully resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis even at the highest concentration (1 μg/ml) tested (Fig. 1D). These differences of TRAIL sensitivity were neither due to clonal differences of expression levels of crucial components of the apical death receptor signaling pathways (Fig. 1C) nor by differential expression of TRAIL receptors (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the ratio of cFLIPL to caspase-8 correlates with resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in keratinocytes. cFLIPL Inhibits TRAIL-induced NF-κB Activation—We have previously reported that inhibition of caspases by pharmacological agents blocks TRAIL-mediated apoptosis but allows for activation of NF-κB (20Leverkus M. Neumann M. Mengling T. Rauch C.T. Brocker E.B. Krammer P.H. Walczak H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 553-559PubMed Google Scholar). Because cFLIPL inhibits TRAIL-induced apoptosis as effectively as caspase inhibitors, we hypothesized that TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation should be similarly augmented in cFLIPL-expressing cells when compared with TRAIL-stimulated control cells in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk. However, when we measured NF-κB-specific DNA binding activity after stimulation with TRAIL using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we surprisingly found that cFLIPL-overexpressing keratinocytes failed to activate NF-κB following TRAIL treatment (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–12). In line with our previous reports (21Leverkus M. Sprick M.R. Wachter T. Mengling T. Baumann B. Serfling E. Brocker E.B. Goebeler M. Neumann M. Walczak H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Leverkus M. Sprick M.R. Wachter T. Denk A. Brocker E.B. Walczak H. Neumann M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 149-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), NF-κB was activated following treatment with TRAIL in control cells, and this was enhanced in the presence of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–4). Interestingly, this effect was specific for TRAIL, since all keratinocyte lines examined potently induced NF-κB following treatment with TNFα, irrespective of their expression levels of cFLIPL (Fig. 2A, lanes 13–15). NF-κB activation following TNFα or TRAIL treatment is dependent on IκBα degradation (for a review, see Ref. 10Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). To further characterize at which level TRAIL-mediated NF-κB activation is inhibited by cFLIPL, we analyzed cytoplasmic IκBα degradation after stimulation with TRAIL or TNFα. As shown in Fig. 2B, TRAIL-induced IκBα degradation was abrogated in cFLIPL-expressing keratinocytes, whereas cFLIPL did not interfere with TNFα-induced IκBα degradation. Taken together, these data indicate that cFLIPL specifically blocks TRAIL-mediated IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation, whereas TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation is unaffected by the expression level of cFLIPL. cFLIPL Inhibits TRAIL-mediated Induction of IL-8—TRAIL induces the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 in an NF-κB-dependent manner (22Leverkus M.

To examine the network of interactions that require IP6 production, an analysis of fitness defects was conducted in mutants harboring both an ipk1 null allele and a mutant allele in genes encoding nucleoporins or transport factors. Enhanced lethality was observed with a specific subset of mutants, including nup42, nup116, nup159, dbp5, and gle2, all of which had been previously connected to Gle1 function. Complementation of the nup116Δipk1Δ and nup42Δipk1Δ double mutants did not require the Phe-Gly repeat domains in the respective nucleoporins, suggesting that IP6 was acting subsequent to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein targeting to the nuclear pore complex. With Nup42 and Nup159 localized exclusively to the nuclear pore complex cytoplasmic side, we speculated that IP6 may regulate a cytoplasmic step in mRNA export. To test this prediction, the spatial requirements for the production of IP6 were investigated. Restriction of Ipk1 to the cytoplasm did not block IP6 production. Moreover, coincident sequestering of both Ipk1 and Mss4 (an enzyme required for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate production) to the cytoplasm also did not block IP6 production. Given that the kinase required for inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate production (Ipk2) is localized in the nucleus, these results indicated that soluble inositides were diffusing between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Additionally, the cytoplasmic production of IP6 by plasma membrane-anchored Ipk1 rescued a gle1-2 ipk1-4 synthetic lethal mutant. Thus, cytoplasmic IP6 production is sufficient for mediating the Gle1-mRNA export pathway.

The nucleus is the defining structure of a eukaryotic cell and houses the genetic information that characterizes the organism. The nuclear compartment is separated from the cytoplasm by the nuclear envelope (NE), 1The abbreviations used are: NE, nuclear envelope; NPC, nuclear pore complex; Nups, nucleoporins; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; FG, phenylalanine-glycine; IP6, inositol hexakisphosphate; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP4, inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate; IP5, inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate; PP-IP4, diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate; IP7, diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate; IP8, bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate; PI(4)P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Kaps, karyopherins; GLFG, glycine-leucine-phenylalanine-glycine.1The abbreviations used are: NE, nuclear envelope; NPC, nuclear pore complex; Nups, nucleoporins; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; FG, phenylalanine-glycine; IP6, inositol hexakisphosphate; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; IP4, inositol 1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate; IP5, inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate; PP-IP4, diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate; IP7, diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate; IP8, bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate; PI(4)P, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Kaps, karyopherins; GLFG, glycine-leucine-phenylalanine-glycine. two lipid bilayer membranes that join to form pores containing nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The 60-MDa NPC structure is assembled from multiple copies of ∼30 distinct proteins designated nucleoporins (Nups) (1Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Suprapto A. Hjertaas K. Zhao Y. Chait B.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 2Cronshaw J.M. Krutchinsky A.N. Zhang W. Chait B.T. Matunis M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 915-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The central region of the NPC consists of inner and outer rings connected by a series of spokes. Fibrils extend from either face of the NPC, and the filaments on the nuclear side are joined at the distal end to form a basket structure (3Fahrenkrog B. Aebi U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The NPCs create aqueous semipermeable portals across the NE that allow the passive diffusion of small molecules. However, translocation of macromolecules through the NPC requires facilitated transport mediated by Nups, other NPC-associated proteins, and shuttling transport factors (4Weis K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 5Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Dev.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16593-16596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). One class of macromolecules that must traverse the NPC is mRNAs. The movement of mRNA through the NPC is a regulated process in the progression from DNA transcription in the nucleus to the production of a translated protein in the cytoplasm (7Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar, 8Vinciguerra P. Stutz F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To ensure proper gene expression, there are many steps contributing to this pathway and potential points of control by signaling and checkpoint mechanisms. The pre-mRNA is processed by polyadenylation, 5′-cap addition, and potentially splicing; packaged into a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) complex; and targeted to the NPC. Translocation through the NPC is followed by coordinated delivery of the transcript to the ribosome and recycling of RNA-binding proteins and shuttling transport factors to the nucleus. A conserved heterodimer, Mex67/Mtr2 in budding yeast and NXF1/p15 in vertebrates, is a central player in this mechanism (9Stutz F. Izaurralde E. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 319-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Reed R. Hurt E.

Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2004; 116: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Mex67/Mtr2 has been linked to both the transcription and splicing machineries. It also is thought to serve as a transport mediator by interacting both with hnRNPs and with Nups that harbor domains with phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeats (10Reed R. Hurt E.

The essential factor Gle1 also associates with Nups (17Murphy R. Wente S.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 18Rayala H.J. Kendirgi F. Barry D.M. Majerus P.W.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5761-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and, in yeast cells, is functionally connected to the hnRNP Nab2 (21Suntharalingam M. Alcazar-Roman A.R. Wente S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35384-35391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The dual association of shuttling transport factors with both cargo and Nups is a fundamental tenet of NPC translocation models. However, how all these events are coordinated for the seamless delivery of mRNAs for translation remains poorly defined. The overall mechanism for nuclear mRNA export is likely based on coordinated changes in the hnRNP composition and associated factors (8Vinciguerra P. Stutz F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Some proteins are specifically recruited cotranscriptionally or coincident with execution of different processing steps. For example, association of the RNA-binding protein Yra1/ALY/REF is promoted by Sub2/UAP56 and transcription elongation factors (22Luo M.L. Zhou Z. Magni K. Christoforides C. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Reed R. Nature. 2001; 413: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 23Strasser K. Masuda S. Mason P. Pfannstiel J. Oppizzi M. Rodriguez-Navarro S. Rondon A.G. Aguilera A. Struhl K. Reed R.

Biol. 2002; 22: 8241-8253Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition, the association of some proteins is temporal, with release prior to export, whereas others remain assembled until after transport to the cytoplasm (25Dreyfuss G. Kim V.N. Kataoka N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). The DEAD box protein Dbp5 may play a role in hnRNP remodeling during export (19Hodge C.A. Colot H.V. Stafford P. Cole C.N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5778-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Schmitt C. von Kobbe C. Bachi A. Pante N. Rodrigues J.P. Boscheron C. Rigaut G. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Carmo-Fonseca M. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4332-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Regulated post-translational modifications may also trigger changes in protein-protein interactions. In budding yeast, the SR (serine/arginine-rich)-like protein Npl3 undergoes specific phosphorylation and dephosphorylation cycles linked to proper mRNA export (12Gilbert W. Guthrie C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 201-212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 27Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 28Yun C.Y. Fu X.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 707-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The efficient export of mRNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is also influenced by the production of inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) (29York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The budding yeast metabolic pathway from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to IP6 requires three enzymes. PI(4,5)P2 is hydrolyzed by phospholipase C (Plc1) to produce soluble inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) (30Flick J.S. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5861-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Ipk2 is a dual specificity IP3 6-kinase and inositol-1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) 3-kinase that generates both IP4 and inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (IP5) (31Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Finally, Ipk1 is an IP5 2-kinase that generates IP6 (29York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). All evidence to date indicates that the IP3-to-IP6 pathway produces distinct molecules involved in regulating multiple and diverse nuclear processes, including mRNA export, transcription, and chromatin remodeling (29York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 31Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D.

Work also suggests that specifically IP6 production plays a role in mRNA export. A saturating synthetic lethal screen with a gle1 mutant specifically identified mutant alleles of PLC1, IPK2, and IPK1 (29York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 31Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The plc1, ipk2, and ipk1 mutants independently have defects in poly(A+) mRNA export (29York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Moreover, the common loss-of-function biochemical defect among the three mutants is a loss of IP6 production, and Ipk1 is required for suppression of the temperature sensitivity of a gle1 mutant by Plc1 overexpression (29York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized ipk1 point mutants that are nonfunctional with regard to both IP6 production and Gle1 function (34Ives E.B. Nichols J. Wente S.R. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36575-36583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This observation and the fact that an ipk2 mutant is defective even though the Ipk1 protein is present (29York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) are collectively strong evidence that IP6 itself is the required mediator versus a nonkinase-related role for the Ipk1 protein. IP6 also serves as a precursor for diphosphorylated inositols such as diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate (IP7) and bisdiphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate (IP8) (35Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, the enzyme required for IP7 production is not apparently required for mRNA export (34Ives E.B. Nichols J. Wente S.R. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36575-36583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 36Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that IP6 acts to regulate efficient mRNA export mediated by Gle1. The presence of inositide-modifying enzymes and independent lipid pools within the nucleus also supports the hypothesis that inositide pathways function within the nucleus (37Divecha N. Clarke J.H. Roefs M. Halstead J.R. D'Santos C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 38Maraldi N.M. Zini N. Santi S. Manzoli F.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Pik1, an essential phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, and Mss4, an essential phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) 5-kinase, are both required for PI(4,5)P2 production in budding yeast (39Desrivieres S.

Admon A. Thorner J. Science. 1993; 262: 1444-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Pik1 and Mss4 localize in the nucleus and that Mss4 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (41Walch-Solimena C. Novick P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 42Audhya A. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4223-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, PI(4)P 5-kinases also localize in the nucleus (43Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3547-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation studies showed that, in budding yeast, Ipk2 concentrates in the nucleus (31Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 44Bercy J. Dubois E. Messenguy F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 55: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas Ipk1 is localized in the nucleus and at the nuclear rim (29York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). These connections suggest that production of inositols in the nucleus might be critical for regulating events in the nuclear compartment, including mRNA export. However, the spatial constraints for soluble inositide production in the cytoplasmic versus nuclear compartments have not been investigated. The mechanism by which Ipk1 activity and IP6 production regulate mRNA export is also unknown. In this study, we have taken multiple approaches to further investigate the requirements for IP6 production in nuclear transport and NPC function. We speculate that the production of soluble IP6 influences events at the cytoplasmic face of the NPC during mRNA export. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, and Media—The S. cerevisiae strains were grown in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or synthetic minimal medium lacking appropriate amino acids and supplemented with 2% glucose. Yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate method (45Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5-Fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA; USBiological) was used at a concentration of 1.0 mg/ml. Kanamycin resistance (KANR) was selected on medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 (USBiological). Nourseothricin resistance (NATR) was selected on medium containing 100 μg/ml ClonNat (Werner BioAgents). Unless indicated otherwise, the null (Δ) mutant strains used in these studies were obtained from Research Genetics. Table I summarizes the novel yeast strains used in this study, and Table II summarizes the plasmids. The ipk1Δ::KANR strain from the null collection (Research Genetics) was altered to generate the starting strain for the screen. The antibiotic resistance was changed from kanamycin to nourseothricin (ipk1Δ::NATR) using an MX4 switcher cassette (46Tong A.H. Evangelista M. Parsons A.B. Xu H. Bader G.D. Page N. Robinson M. Raghibizadeh S. Hogue C.W. Bussey H. Andrews B. Tyers M. Boone C. Science. 2001; 294: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). The ipk1Δ::NATR strain was then manipulated to generate a MATα strain in which the CAN1 locus was disrupted with HIS3 behind the MFA1 promoter (can1::MFA1 pr-HIS3) to allow expression of HIS3 specifically in MAT a haploid cells (46Tong A.H. Evangelista M. Parsons A.B. Xu H. Bader G.D. Page N. Robinson M. Raghibizadeh S. Hogue C.W. Bussey H. Andrews B. Tyers M. Boone C. Science. 2001; 294: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). Some of the haploid strains were generated by classic sporulation and dissection of the heterozygous diploids. Alternatively, the synthetic lethal testing strategy developed by Boone and co-workers was used (46Tong A.H. Evangelista M. Parsons A.B. Xu H. Bader G.D. Page N. Robinson M. Raghibizadeh S. Hogue C.W. Bussey H. Andrews B. Tyers M. Boone C. Science. 2001; 294: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). In the latter situation, strains with null KANR-marked mutations in individual genes related to transport were arrayed onto a single 96-well plate. The transport factor plate was pinned onto a lawn of the ipk1Δ::NATR strain or an isogenic strain with an independent NATR gene. The resulting diploids were selected with kanamycin and nourseothricin. After sporulation, the first round of selection was for HIS3 to select only MAT a spores. Additive rounds of selection were completed to select for cells with kanamycin and nourseothricin resistance, generating a corresponding array of double mutant strains. Strains generated in the array format were not individually isolated as permanents. For double mutants that showed a potential growth defect, haploid strains were independently generated by sporulation and tetrad dissection of the heterozygous diploids. Equivalent mutations in the W303 background were also tested.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSourceGeneralW303aMATa ade2-1 ura3-1 leu2-3,112 trp1-1 his3-11,15 can1-100W303MAT a/α ade2-1/ade2-1 ura3-1/ura3-1 leu2-3,112/leu2-3,112 trp1-1/trp1-1 his3-11,15/his3-11,15 can1-100/can1-100PJ69-4AMAT a trp1-901 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-200 gal4Δ gal80Δ LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 GAL2-ADE2 met::GAL7-lacZRef. 76James P.

https://openalex.org/W2139515242,"The Nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) is essential for the progression from human and simian immunodeficiency virus infection to full-blown AIDS. Recent studies indicate that Nef generates anti-apoptotic signals in HIV-infected T cells, suppressing cell death early in infection to allow productive viral replication. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that Nef also promotes proliferation of myeloid cells through a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3-dependent pathway. Here we demonstrate that Nef suppresses cell death induced by cytokine deprivation in the human macrophage precursor cell line, TF-1. Nef selectively induced up-regulation of Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic gene that is also regulated by granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor in this cell line. Activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway also correlated with the survival of TF-1/Nef cells. Using the selective mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059, we found that Nef-induced Erk signaling is essential for Bcl-XL up-regulation and cell survival. In contrast, expression of Bcl-XL and TF-1 survival was not affected by dominant-negative signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. These data suggest that Nef produces survival signals in myeloid cells through Erk-mediated Bcl-XL induction, a pathway distinct from Nef survival pathways recently reported in T lymphocytes.

Immunity. 2002; 16: 493-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Nef plays a crucial role in the maintenance of high viral loads and subsequent development of AIDS-like disease in Rhesus monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (3Kestler H. Ringler D.J. Mori K. Panicali D.L. Sehgal P.K. Daniel M.D. Desrosiers R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). Similarly, long-term survivors of AIDS are often infected with Nef-defective HIV strains (4Kirchhoff F. Greenough T.C. Brettler D.B. Sullivan J.L. Desrosiers R.C. N. Engl. J.

Recent development of a transgenic mouse model for AIDS demonstrated that expression of Nef alone is sufficient to cause AIDS-like pathology (6Hanna Z. Kay D.G. Rebai N. Guimond A. Jothy S. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1998; 95: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 7Hanna Z. Weng X. Kay D.G. Poudrier J. Lowell C. Jolicoeur P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9378-9392Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although these and other studies implicate Nef as a major progression factor in AIDS, the mechanism by which it contributes to HIV replication and pathogenesis is still unclear.Nef is a 25-30 kDa cytosolic protein with an N-terminal myristoylation signal and no known catalytic activity. Instead, Nef associates with diverse cellular proteins and modifies their functions in host cells (1Geyer M. Fackler O.T. Peterlin B.M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 8Herna R.G. Saksela K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D268-D283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nef down-modulates cell surface CD4 and major histocompatibility complex I receptors, which contributes to evasion of host immune surveillance. Protein kinases and other signaling molecules have also been found to interact with Nef. For example, Nef binds directly to multiple Src family kinases, including Hck, Lck, and Fyn (8Herna R.G. Saksela K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D268-D283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Saksela K. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: D606-D618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence suggests that Nef-Hck interaction may be essential for AIDS progression (7Hanna Z. Weng X. Kay D.G. Poudrier J. Lowell C. Jolicoeur P. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 9378-9392Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Nef also interacts with several Ser/Thr kinases, including p21-activated protein kinase, protein kinase C, and the Erk mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (8Herna R.G. Saksela K. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D268-D283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Saksela K. Front. Biosci. 1997; 2: D606-D618Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Nef was shown to increase Erk1/2 activity initiated by T-cell receptor stimulation in primary CD4+ T cells obtained from peripheral blood (10Jacque J.M. Mann A. Enslen H. Sharova N. Brichacek B. Davis R.J. Stevenson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2607-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Enhanced Erk activity may be responsible for increased T-cell activation by Nef, which facilitates HIV replication in this target cell type. Erk is also involved in induction of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor by Nef in macrophages, another major target cell for HIV infection (11Biggs T.E. Cooke S.J. Barton C.H. Harris M.P. Saksela K. Mann D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The induction of AP-1 may contribute to the activated phenotype of Nef-transfected and HIV-1-infected macrophages.Several recent reports have suggested that Nef plays a role in longevity of HIV-infected T cells by affecting mediators of apoptosis. Death receptor-mediated apoptosis, which is critical to the host cell immune reaction, is blocked by Nef through apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 inhibition (12Geleziunas R. Xu W. Takeda K. Ichijo H. Greene W.C. Nature. 2001; 410: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In addition, Nef suppresses T-cell apoptosis initiated by serum starvation or HIV replication. In this case, Nef was shown to induce serine phosphorylation of Bad, the mitochondrial pro-apoptotic mediator, through a previously described p21-activated protein kinase known to associate with Nef (13Wolf D. Witte V. Laffert B. Blume K. Stromer E. Trapp S. d'Aloja P. Schurmann A. Baur A.S. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1217-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).Recent work from our laboratory has shown that Nef promotes cytokine-independent proliferation of the macrophage precursor cell line, TF-1, through a mechanism that requires the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) transcription factor (14Briggs S.D. Scholtz B. Jacque J.M. Swingler S. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25605-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the present report, we show that Nef suppresses apoptosis in this cell line by selectively up-regulating the mitochondrial anti-apoptosis gene, Bcl-XL (15Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). Experiments with pharmacological inhibitors indicate that cell survival and Bcl-XL induction by Nef are dependent on the Erk MAPK pathway but independent of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) and Akt activation. Surprisingly, dominant-negative Stat3 did not impact Nef-induced cell survival or Bcl-XL induction, despite the identification of Bcl-XL as a Stat3 target gene in other systems (16Catlett-Falcone R. Landowski T.H. Oshiro M.M. Turkson J. Levitzki A. Savino R. Ciliberto G. Moscinski L. Fernández-Luna J.L. Nuñez G. Dalton W.S. Jove R.

These results show, for the first time, that Nef generates anti-apoptotic signals in cells of the myelomonocytic lineage, through a pathway distinct from that observed in T cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterials—The anti-Nef antibody (EH-1, mouse monoclonal) was generously provided by the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Anti-Erk1/2 and anti-phospho-Erk antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-Stat3, anti-Akt, and phospho-Akt antibodies were obtained from Cellular Signaling.

The coding sequence of the murine ER ligand-binding domain (amino acids 281 to 599) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the plasmid pANMerCreMer (19Feil R. Brocard J. Mascrez B. LeMeur M.

The Stat3 dominant-negative mutant carries a Phe substitution for Tyr-705 in the C-terminal tail. A pSRαMSVtkneo construct containing this mutant was used to prepare recombinant retrovirus for infection of TF-1/Nef-ER cells as described elsewhere (14Briggs S.D. Scholtz B. Jacque J.M. Swingler S.

TF-1 cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. To detect phosphorylation of Erk and Akt, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Erk1, Erk2, or Akt antibodies, respectively. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blotted with phospho-specific antibodies to the active forms of Erk1/2 or Akt. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and nitroblue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as colorimetric substrate (Southern Biotechnology Associates) or with the CDP star detection system (Tropix).Apoptosis Assay—Apoptosis was assessed as cell surface Annexin V-FITC binding according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD PharMingen). Briefly, 106 cells were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min and washed twice with cold PBS. Cells were then resuspended in Annexin V binding buffer, and 105 cells were pelleted and incubated with 5 μl of Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl of propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) in a final volume of 100 μl for 15 min. Apoptosis was measured using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson) set for two-color acquisition, and data were analyzed using CellQuest software. For inhibitor experiments, cells were treated with 30 μm PD98059 (23Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After incubation, total cellular RNA was isolated from each cell line using the Totally RNA kit (Ambion Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To measure expression of Bcl-XL, a multi-probe set containing cDNA templates of nine Bcl-2 family members as well as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and L32 as internal controls was used according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences/PharMingen). Briefly, 32P-labeled riboprobes of defined length were generated using T7 RNA polymerase and 50 ng of the DNA template in the presence of 150 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (New England Nuclear). Template DNA was digested with RNase-free DNase, followed by precipitation of labeled RNA. Five μg of total cellular RNA was mixed with 6.2 × 105 cpm of the 32P-labeled riboprobe in hybridization buffer (40 mm 1,4-piperazinedi-ethanesulfonic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, and 80% formamide) and incubated for 5 min at 90 °C, followed by 12 h at 56 °C. The hybridized RNA duplexes were then treated with RNase A and RNase T1, followed by proteinase K digestion. RNase-resistant RNA duplexes were extracted with phenol and precipitated by the addition of equal volumes of 4 m ammonium acetate and 2 volumes of ethanol. Labeled RNA samples were resolved on 6% urea denaturing gels and visualized by autoradiography, and the relative RNA signals were quantitated by densitometry. The relative expression level of Bcl-XL was normalized to that obtained with the GAPDH control for each sample.Detection of Nef-ER Dimers—TF-1/Nef-ER cells (106) were treated for 24 h with or without 1 μm 4-HT, followed by incubation in the presence or absence of GM-CSF for 16 h. For cross-linking, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in 2 mm DSS for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 m Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) and incubating for 15 min. The cells were washed once with PBS and then lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na3VO4). The protein concentration of the cell lysate was determined using the Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as standard. Cell lysates containing 30 μg of protein were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and blotted with a Nef antibody.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—TF-1 cells (107) were centrifuged and washed once with PBS, and nuclear extracts were made using the Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif) and the manufacturer's protocol. The protein concentrations of nuclear extracts were determined using bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagents (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as standard. The probe used for the Stat3 gel-shift assay is based on the sis-inducible element (SIE) (14Briggs S.D. Scholtz B. Jacque J.M. Swingler S. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25605-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Complementary SIE oligonucleotides (20 pmol) were annealed in 10 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and labeled by combining 1 μl of annealed oligonucleotide with 4 μl of Labeling Mix-dATP (Pharmacia), 2 μl of [α-32P]dATP (10 mCi/ml; Amersham), and 1 μl of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc., 3.7 units/μl) in a final volume of 20 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a G-25 Sephadex spin column (Millipore). Gel-shift reactions contained 10 μg of TF-1 cell nuclear extract and 40,000 cpm of labeled SIE probe in a final volume of 20 μl as described elsewhere (25Schreiner S.J. Schiavone A.P. Smithgall T.E.

Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and run on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were fixed with 10% acetic acid/10% methanol, rinsed with water, dried, and exposed to BioMax film (Kodak).RESULTSHIV-1 Nef Inhibits Apoptosis Induced by Cytokine Deprivation in the Human Myeloid Leukemia Cell Line, TF-1—Previous work from our laboratory has shown that HIV-1 Nef induces cytokine-independent proliferation of the human macrophage precursor cell line, TF-1 (14Briggs S.D. Scholtz B. Jacque J.M. Swingler S. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25605-25611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This cell line is dependent on GM-CSF for growth and undergoes apoptosis after cytokine withdrawal. To investigate whether the GM-CSF-independent proliferation induced by Nef results from suppression of apoptosis in TF-1 cells, we first expressed HIV-1 Nef in TF-1 cells by retroviral transduction. Cells were then plated in the presence or absence of GM-CSF, and apoptosis was measured as cell surface Annexin V staining 4 days later. As shown in Fig. 1, 60% of the control cells infected with empty vector underwent apoptosis upon GM-CSF withdrawal, demonstrating the cytokine requirement for survival of this cell line. In contrast, only 25% of TF-1 cells expressing Nef underwent apoptosis after GM-CSF withdrawal, demonstrating that Nef suppresses apoptosis induced by cytokine deprivation in cells of myeloid lineage.Although only 25% of TF-1/Nef cells underwent apoptosis after GM-CSF withdrawal, this number was reduced to 10% in the presence of GM-CSF (Fig. 1). However, immunofluorescent staining of the Nef-expressing cell population and flow cytometry revealed that only 60-70% of the cells express detectable levels of the Nef protein (data not shown). This heterogeneity in Nef expression in the TF-1 cell population may account for the incomplete survival effect. As described in a later section, experiments with clonal populations of TF-1 cells expressing a conditional form of Nef show responses equivalent to GM-CSF.Induction of Bcl-XLExpression in TF-1 Cells Expressing Nef—Nef-induced proliferation of TF-1 cells requires the Stat3 transcription factor (14Briggs S.D.

Briggs S.D. Schreiner S. Lerner E.C. Cheng H. Wilson M.B. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2612-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Stat3-mediated survival signaling has been linked to Bcl-XL expression in tumor cells and other systems (16Catlett-Falcone R. Landowski T.H. Oshiro M.M. Turkson J. Levitzki A. Savino R. Ciliberto G.

Bcl-XL is an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of mitochondrial apoptotic regulators (15Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar, 27Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3225-3236Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). The relative levels of the pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins are key determinants in the regulation of cell death and survival. Therefore, we investigated Bcl-2 family gene expression in Nef-expressing TF-1 cells using an RNase protection assay. As shown in Fig. 2, Bcl-XL transcript levels from TF-1/Nef cells were selectively increased 2.5-fold relative to control cells in the absence of GM-CSF. The steady-state levels of Bcl-XL transcripts in TF-1/Nef cells are very close to those observed in parental cells grown in the presence of GM-CSF, suggesting that the level of Bcl-XL gene expression maintained by Nef is sufficient to support survival. In contrast, expression of other Bcl-2 family members was unaffected by Nef, including the genes encoding the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and Bfl-1, and the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Bak, Bad, and Bik. These results identify Bcl-XL as a candidate downstream target gene that may contribute to the anti-apoptotic effects of Nef in this myeloid cell context.Fig. 2HIV-1 Nef selectively induces up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl-XL TF-1 cells expressing Nef or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a negative control were incubated in the presence or absence of GM-CSF for 16 h. A, total RNA was extracted and analyzed for expression of Bcl-2 family members by RNase protection assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” Yeast tRNA was included in the reaction as a negative control, whereas HeLa cell RNA served as a positive control. Labeled RNA bands were visualized by autoradiography. The position of each undigested RNA probe is indicated on the left, with a line indicating the position of the smaller protected fragments that result from RNase treatment. The position of the protected Bcl-XL fragment is indicted by the arrow. B, the relative levels of Bcl-XL transcripts in each sample were normalized to GAPDH expression and are presented as the fold increase relative to the GFP control. Results represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Nef Survival Signaling in TF-1 Cells Requires MAPK but Not PI3K Activation—The Erk MAPK pathway is involved in proliferative and survival signaling from a wide variety of growth factors and cytokines (28Ballif B.A. Blenis J.

Previous studies have shown that Nef activates the AP-1 transcription factor in macrophages through a pathway involving Hck and Erk (11Biggs T.E. Cooke S.J. Barton C.H. Harris M.P. Saksela K. Mann D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Other work has shown that Erk activation is involved in the GM-CSF-induced proliferation of TF-1 cells (30Kolonics A. Apati A. Janossy J. Brozik A. Gati R. Schaefer A. Magocsi M. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting that Nef may mimic this aspect of GM-CSF signaling in this cell line. To test the requirement for Erk activation in Nef-induced cellular survival, we treated TF-1/Nef cells as well as control cells with the Mek inhibitor PD98059 (23Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar) in the presence or absence of GM-CSF. Apoptosis was measured as Annexin V staining 4 days after treatment. As shown in Fig. 3A, PD98059 completely reversed Nef-induced cell survival. In contrast, PD98059 produced only a partial reversal of GM-CSF-induced TF-1 cell survival, indicating that the Nef but not the GM-CSF survival signal is highly dependent upon Erk activation.Fig. 3The Mek inhibitor PD98059 blocks the anti-apoptotic effect of Nef in TF-1 cells. A, control and Nef-expressing TF-1 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of PD98059 (30 μm) and GM-CSF as shown. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry of Annexin V-FITC-stained cells 4 days later. This experiment was repeated three times, and the mean percentages of apoptotic cells ± S.E. are indicated. B, lysates were prepared from control and TF-1/Nef cells after incubation in the presence or absence of PD98059 (30 μm) and GM-CSF as indicated. Erk1 and Erk2 were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with phospho-specific antibodies to the active kinases (top two panels). The same blots were reprobed with Erk1 or Erk2 antibodies to verify equivalent protein recovery (bottom two panels). This experiment was repeated twice with comparable results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test the ability of Nef to activate Erk/MAPK signaling in TF-1 cells, control and Nef-expressing cells were incubated in the presence or absence of GM-CSF for 16 h. Erk1 and Erk2 were then immunoprecipitated, followed by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3B, Nef expression dramatically increased both Erk1 and Erk2 activation in the absence of GM-CSF. The extent of Nef-induced Erk activation was similar to that observed with GM-CSF treatment. PD98059 suppressed Erk1/2 activation by both Nef and GM-CSF. Control immunoblots for Erk proteins displayed no differences, demonstrating that the Nef-mediated increase in Erk1/2 activity was not attributable to changes in protein levels.Recent work has shown that anti-apoptotic signaling by HIV-1 Nef involves the PI3K pathway in T cells (13Wolf D.

To examine whether PI3K also contributes to Nef survival signaling in myeloid cells, we tested the effect of a specific PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (24Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J.

https://openalex.org/W1976151026,"We have shown previously that insulin-like growth factor-I or lens epithelium-derived growth factor increases the translocation of protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ)to the membrane and the phosphorylation of Cx43 by PKCγ and causes a subsequent decrease of gap junction activity (Nguyen, T. A., Boyle, D. L., Wagner, L. M., Shinohara, T., and Takemoto, D. J. (2003) Exp. Eye Res. 76, 565–572; Lin, D., Boyle, D. L., and Takemoto, D. J. (2003) Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 44, 1160–1168). Gap junction activity in lens epithelial cells is regulated by PKCγ-mediated phosphorylation of Cx43. PKCγ activity is stimulated by growth factor-regulated increases in the synthesis of diacylglycerol but is inhibited by cytosolic docking proteins such as 14-3-3. Here we have identified two sites on the PKCγ-C1B domain that are responsible for its interaction with 14-3-3ϵ. Two sites, C1B1 (residues 101–112) and C1B5 (residues 141–151), are located within the C1 domain of PKCγ. C1B1 and/or C1B5 synthetic peptides can directly compete for the binding of 14-3-3ϵ, resulting in the release of endogenous cellular PKCγ from 14-3-3ϵ, in vivo or in vitro, in activation of PKCγ enzyme activity, phosphorylation of PKCγ, in the subsequent translocation of PKCγ to the membrane, and in inhibition of gap junction activity. Gap junction activity was decreased by at least 5-fold in cells treated with C1B1 or C1B5 peptides when compared with a control. 100 μm of C1B1 or C1B5 peptides also caused a 10- or 4-fold decrease of Cx43 plaque formation compared with control cells. The uptake of these synthetic peptides into cells was verified by using high pressure liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight-mass spectrometry. We have demonstrated that the activity and localization of PKCγ are regulated by its binding to 14-3-3ϵ at the C1B domain of PKCγ. Synthetic peptides corresponding to these regions of PKCγ successfully competed for the binding of 14-3-3ϵ to endogenous PKCγ, resulting in inhibition of gap junction activity. This demonstrates that synthetic peptides can be used to exogenously regulate gap junctions.

Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar).For activation to occur, the PKCs are often covalently modified by phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues. This is thought to induce a conformational change in the PKC protein, resulting in an enhanced interaction with membranes (21Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Several signaling proteins use two membrane-targeting modules to reversibly regulate their activation state and cellular distribution (21Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 22Hurley J.H. Misra S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 49-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Each module of the classical PKC binds membranes with low affinity, with tight membrane binding achieved when both domains are membrane-bound. When the affinity of one module for membranes is dependent on stimulus-dependent changes in membrane composition (generation of lipid secondary messengers) or protein structure (phosphorylation), the interaction with the membrane can be reversibly regulated (21Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). PKC has served as a model for the reversible regulation of membrane location by the concerted action of two membrane-targeting modules. PKCγ has two C1 domain repeats, C1A and C1B. However, unlike the classical PKCα isoform, both the C1A and C1B domain have high affinity for DAG, even at low Ca2+ levels (23Ananthanarayanan B. Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46886-46894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This enzyme can be activated by very low DAG levels (2Lin D. Boyle D.L. Takemoto D.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, the C1 domain of PKCγ has been hypothesized to act as an oxidative stress switch through modifications of the Cys residues without a DAG or Ca2+ signal (48Gopalakrishna R. Jaken S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). We have reported recently that PKCγ from whole lens is activated by exogenous hydrogen peroxide (20Lin D. Lobell S. Jewell A. Takemoto D. Mol. Vis. 2004; 10: 688-695PubMed Google Scholar). This activation could be regulated by the interaction of the PKCγ with membrane docking proteins such as 14-3-3.The C1 domain of PKCγ is a Cys-rich region from 36 to 151 of PKCγ residues. It is present as a tandem repeat, designated C1A and C1B (24Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The NMR structure of the C1B domain of PKCγ reveals a globular domain with two pulled β-sheets forming the ligand binding pocket (25Xu R.X. Pawelczyk T. Xia T.H. Brown S.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10709-10717Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two Zn2+ atoms are coordinated by His and Cys residues at opposite ends of the primary sequence, helping to stabilize the domain. Several reports (26Aitken A. Howell S. Jones D. Madrazo J. Martin H. Patel Y. Robinson K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Hausser A. Storz P. Gisela L. Stoll H. Liu Y.C Altman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9258-9264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) suggest that docking of PKC to 14-3-3 involves the C1B domain of PKC.There are two possible 14-3-3 consensus binding regions in the C1B of PKCγ for 14-3-3 binding, residues 101–112 and 141–151. In order to identify which 14-3-3 isoform interacts with PKCγ, we first examined the interaction between PKCγ and 14-3-3 isoforms, ϵ, γ, and ζ. PKC is usually cytoplasmic and inactive and translocates to membranes upon binding of lipids and Ca2+ (28Irie K. Yanai Y. Oie K. Ishizawa J. Nakagawa Y. Ohigashi H. Wender P.A. Kikkawa U. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1725-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 29Kowara R. Gryckiewicz E. Matecki A. Pawelczyk T. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1999; 46: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). But as reported previously (2Lin D. Boyle D.L. Takemoto D.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Ananthanarayanan B. Stahelin R.V. Digman M.A. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46886-46894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), PKCγ will translocate with only a DAG signal. PKCs can bind to a scaffold protein, such as 14-3-3, which is thought to bind in the cytoplasm and can either activate or inhibit an individual PKC isoform (26Aitken A. Howell S. Jones D. Madrazo J. Martin H. Patel Y. Robinson K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 149: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).Previously in our laboratory, we have shown that IGF-I or LEDGF decreases gap junction activity through the activation of PKCγ, causing a PKC-mediated phosphorylation of connexin 43 (Cx43), and then a decrease in gap junction activity (1Nguyen T.A. Boyle D.L. Wagner L.M. Shinohara T. Takemoto D.J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 2Lin D. Boyle D.L. Takemoto D.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Cx43 and subsequent decrease of gap junction activity could be regulated through the release of PKCγ from 14-3-3, followed by the activation and translocation of PKC to the membrane, and then by subsequent PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation of Cx43. In this study, we have investigated the interaction of PKCγ with 14-3-3ϵ and have identified the residues on PKCγ which interact with 14-3-3ϵ. We report the competition of endogenous PKCγ binding to 14-3-3ϵ in live cells or in vitro by C1 domain peptides. This resulted in the endogenous PKCγ translocation to the plasma membrane, in the phosphorylation Cx43, and in subsequent decreases in gap junction activity and gap junction plaque formation in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—N/N1003A rabbit lens epithelial cells were obtained from Dr. John Reddan (Rochester, MI). Monoclonal antibodies against PKCγ were purchased from BD Biosciences. Polyclonal antibodies against 14-3-3ϵ, -γ, and -ζ, Raf-1, and protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal rabbit antibody against phosphoserine was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and PepTag nonradioactive protein kinase C assay system was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose), trypsin-EDTA, gentamicin, and penicillin/streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Atlanta Biologicals (Norcross, GA). LEDGF was from Dr. Toshimichi Shinohara (Omaha, NE). GST-14-3-3ϵ clone was generously provided by Dr. M. B. Yaffe (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). PKCγ clone was kindly provided by Dr. Peggy Zelenka (National Eye Institute, Bethesda, MD). IGF-I and protease inhibitor mixture were purchased from Sigma. Lucifer yellow and rhodamine dextran were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Cells and Cell Cultures—N/N1003A rabbit lens epithelial cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks (Midwest Scientific) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The cells were grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 90% air and 10% CO2 and used for experiments when they reached 90% confluency.Endogenous DAG Assay—Cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks and dosed at 10 ng/ml LEDGF for various times. Sample preparation and radioenzymatic assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions for the sn-1,2-diacylglycerol assay reagents system (Amersham Biosciences). Total lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol and used as the substrates for DAG kinase. Phosphatidic acid (PA). which was labeled by 32P. was produced by the reaction. The product mixtures were separated by thin layer chromatography, and zones corresponding to 32P-PA were visualized by autoradiography of the dried plates overnight. The spots containing 32P-PA were quantitated by scintillation counting. Endogenous DAG levels were calculated from DAG standard curves.PKC Enzyme Activity—Activation of the PKCγ isoform was determined by measurement of enzyme activity. Cells were grown ± LEDGF for 10, 20, or 30 min. For peptide studies, cells were grown ± 100 μm peptides for 2 h prior to the addition of LEDGF. PKC activity was determined by use of a PepTag assay kit. Equal protein from whole cell extracts was immunoprecipitated with PKCγ antisera at 4 °C for 4 h as described previously (2Lin D. Boyle D.L. Takemoto D.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated PKCγ-agarose bead complexes were incubated with the PKC reaction mixture according to the manufacturer's instructions for the PepTag assay kit. Reactions were stopped, and fluorescent PepTag peptides (PKC reaction products) were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized under UV light. The phosphorylated peptide bands were excised and measured as described at 570 nm (2Lin D. Boyle D.L. Takemoto D.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).Synthetic Peptides—Two possible sites of the C1 domain of PKCγ, residues 101–112 and 141–151, were synthesized by Sigma Genosys. Synthetic peptide C1B1 sequence is HKFRLHSYSSPT; C1B5 sequence is RCVRSVPSLCG, and nonspecific peptide is SFGKCHLYPKV.Measurement of Uptake of Synthetic Peptides Using HPLC and Mass Spectrometry—7.2 × 106 cells were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks and treated with 100 μm of C1B5 (equivalent to 11.76 μg per flask) for 2 h. 5 μl of 250 μl of whole cell extract of treated cells was dissolved in 295 μl of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water and then used for HPLC purification and quantification, using a 1.6 mm × 25 cm C18 reverse phase column (Vydac, Torrance, CA) with a 5–60% (v/v) linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, over a period of 60 min. Identification was confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The amount of uptake of peptides by the cells was determined from the standard curve of C1B5 peptide alone, using the identical HPLC gradient.Western Blot Analyses—Cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells in ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin. 20 μg of total protein were boiled and resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE minigels under reducing conditions. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk and probed with diluted antibodies overnight as indicated. Bands were revealed by chemiluminescence reaction (ECL, Pierce). Blots were routinely stripped in a denaturing buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.6), 10% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) and reprobed with antibodies for loading control. In this and subsequent experiments Western blots are quantified by image analyses using Un-scan-it gel software(Orem, UT).Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were cultured to 90% confluency in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks and then treated with 10 ng/ml LEDGF for 30 min (1Nguyen T.A. Boyle D.L. Wagner L.M. Shinohara T. Takemoto D.J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested with 1 ml of ice-cold cell lysis buffer, containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin. The cells were homogenized and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm (20,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C. 500 μg of total soluble proteins (cell lysate) from treated or control cell cultures were used for co-immunoprecipitation. Lysates were first pre-cleared by treatment with 10 μl of protein A/G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 2,000 rpm, the supernatant was collected, and anti-mouse PKCγ was added to cell lysates to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml of antisera and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with constant mixing. 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads were added to the mixture, and the mixture was further incubated for another 2 h on ice. After centrifugation, supernatants were discarded, and the precipitates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Loading buffer was added to the washed precipitates, which were subjected to Western blot analyses with various antibodies as described.In Vitro Competition Assay—GST-14-3-3ϵ was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using anti-GST-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In vitro transcribed/translated PKCγ was made by using TnT-coupled reticulocyte systems (Promega). GST-14-3-3ϵ-agarose beads were washed and incubated with 5 μl of in vitro transcribed/translated PKCγ for 1 h. Various concentrations of C1B5 were added to the complex for an additional 1 h. The complex was then washed and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE as described above.Translocation—Cells were treated with 100 μm of peptides for 2 h prior to addition of LEDGF. As a negative control, cells were treated with a nonspecific peptide at the same dose and time. Cells were harvested in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 20 mm MgCl2 (2Lin D. Boyle D.L. Takemoto D.J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2003; 44: 1160-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were centrifuged for 1 h at 35,000 rpm (100,000 × g) at 4 °C. The sample was separated into supernatant (cytosolic) and pellet (membrane) fractions and analyzed by Western blot as described previously above. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-PKCγ antibodies (1:1000) or other antisera as indicated.Gap Junction Activity—Scrape loading/dye transfer assay (SL/DT) is a common technique to measure gap junction activity. The SL/DT assay provides a rapid and simple measurement of the gap junction communication between cultured cells in a monolayer, and it is based on introducing a transient tear in the plasma membrane without affecting cell viability or colony-forming ability. Lucifer Yellow, which is an intensely fluorescent 4-aminophthalimide, is used as the tracer dye in the SL/DT assay. It does not diffuse through intact plasma membranes, and its low molecular weight (Mr 457.2) permits its transmission from one cell to another presumably through patent gap junctions. Rhodamine dextran is a high molecular weight polymer (Mr 10,000), and it cannot diffuse through intact plasma membranes nor cross the gap junctions; therefore, it is used as a control to differentiate dye transfer from diffusion because of cell damage (30El-Fouly M. Trosko J. Chang C. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Cells were then fixed with 2.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, and the numbers of cells transferring dye are counted using a standard fluorescent or laser-scanning confocal microscope.Cells were grown to 90% confluency on glass coverslips and washed three times with PBS. Then 2.5 ml of 1% (w/v) lucifer yellow and 0.75% (w/v) rhodamine dextran (control for dye transfer) in PBS were added at the center of the coverslip. Using a razor blade, two cuts crossing each other were made on the coverslip, passing through the dye in the center of the coverslip. These cells were incubated with the dye for 1 min, and then the cells were washed three times with PBS. This was followed by incubating the cells in tissue culture medium for 10 min at room temperature, allowing dye to transfer from cell to cell. The cells were then washed three times with PBS and fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Dye transfer was evaluated by examining the cells under a fluorescent microscope. For quantitation, the extent of dye transfer was estimated by counting the number of fluorescent-labeled cells, lucifer yellow and rhodamine dextran, in the microscopic field under ×20 magnification in the center intersection of the cut (31Le A. Musil L. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 80-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Wagner L. Saleh S. Boyle D. Takemoto D. Mol. Vis. 2002; 8: 59-66PubMed Google Scholar). Each treatment was repeated three times, and each slide was counted three times. Results are expressed as the average number of cells that allows dye transfer from cell to cell in 10 min.Gap Junction Plaques—Another method of measuring gap junction activity is by measurements of plaques, large cluster of up to 10,000 gap junction hexamer channels (connexons). Plaques form more functional channels and can be viewed by confocal microscopy of the cell surface. Cells were treated with 100 μm peptides for 2 h prior to LEDGF exposure at various times. The cells were then fixed for 10 min with 2.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. This was followed by incubation with 1 ml of 0.15% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 20 min and blocking of the nonspecific sites with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Anti-Cx43 monoclonal antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin) and then added to the fixed cells and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C. The working dilution of the primary anti-Cx43 (host-rabbit) was 1:250. The secondary antisera, Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes) which is goat anti-rabbit and has an excitation/emission wavelength of 578/603, was used with the working concentration of 5 μg/ml in blocking buffer. The cells were mounted on slides with 1% (v/v) glycerol in PBS. Slides were examined using a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Nikon C1), focusing on the top of the plasma membrane. The number of plaques per cell was determined under ×100 objective lens.Statistical Analysis—The level of significance (see * in figure legends) was considered at p < 0.05 using Student's t test analysis. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments from different batches of cultures.RESULTSLEDGF Increases DAG Levels, PKCγ Enzyme Activity, and PKCγ Autophosphorylation—We have shown previously that PKCγ is a major regulator of gap junction assembly/disassembly when both PKCα and -γ are activated in lens epithelial cells (34Lampe P.D. TenBroek E.M. Burt J.M. Kurata W.E. Johnson R.G. Lau A.F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1503-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) and that LEDGF can cause the translocation of PKCγ, not PKCα, from the cytosol to the membrane. Additionally, the activation of PKCγ by LEDGF induced increases in DAG can cause a decrease in gap junction activity through the phosphorylation of Cx43 (1Nguyen T.A. Boyle D.L. Wagner L.M. Shinohara T. Takemoto D.J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A schematic diagram of PKCγ activation is shown in Fig. 10.Fig. 10Inhibition of gap junction activity via PKCγ-14-3-3ϵ interactions. Growth factors cause an increase in phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ resulting in increased DAG levels. DAG activates the release of PKCγ from 14-3-3ϵ. Translocation of PKCγ from cytosol to membranes takes place and PKCγ interacts with and phosphorylates Cx43 on Ser-368. The sequential events cause a decrease in gap junction activity and in Cx43 plaque number. The two interaction sites on PKCγ are shown in red (squares).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of LEDGF for 10, 15, or 30 min. DAG level was measured using the sn-1,2-diacylglycerol assay system (Amersham Biosciences). The results show that 10 ng/ml LEDGF for 10 min causes a significant increase in DAG level (Fig. 1A). This suggests that LEDGF can increase DAG levels to ∼200 pmol/mg of fresh tissue, a 2-fold increase when compared with basal levels of ∼100 pmol/mg.PKCγ is quite sensitive to small changes in the natural activator, DAG, because of the presence of two tandem zinc-binding motifs in the C1 domain which bind DAG at very low DAG"
https://openalex.org/W2057357214,"The ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1), transports a broad spectrum of conjugated and unconjugated compounds, including natural product chemotherapeutic agents. In this study, we have investigated the importance of the COOH-terminal region of MRP1 for transport activity and basolateral plasma membrane trafficking. The COOH-terminal regions of some ABCC proteins have been implicated in protein trafficking, but the function of this region of MRP1 has not been defined. In contrast to results obtained with other ABCC proteins, we found that the COOH-proximal 30 amino acids of MRP1 can be removed without affecting trafficking to basolateral membranes. However, the truncated protein is inactive. Furthermore, removal of as few as 4 COOH-terminal amino acids profoundly decreases transport activity. Although amino acid sequence conservation of the COOH-terminal regions of ABC proteins is low, secondary structure predictions indicate that they consist of a broadly conserved helix-sheet-sheet-helix-helix structure. Consistent with a conservation of secondary and tertiary structure, MRP1 hybrids containing the COOH-terminal regions of either the homologous MRP2 or the distantly related P-glycoprotein were fully active and trafficked normally. Using mutated proteins, we have identified structural elements containing five conserved hydrophobic amino acids that are required for activity. We show that these are important for binding and hydrolysis of ATP by nucleotide binding domain 2. Based on crystal structures of several ABC proteins, we suggest that the conserved amino acids may stabilize a helical bundle formed by the COOH-terminal three helices and may contribute to interactions between the COOH-terminal region and the protein's two nucleotide binding domains.

The protein has been shown to confer multidrug resistance to structurally diverse, natural product cytotoxic drugs and to mediate their efflux in an ATP-dependent manner (1Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G.

MRP1 has also been detected in tumors with many different cellular origins (3Bates S.E. Holland I.B. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria to Man. Elsevier Science, New York2003: 359-391Crossref Google Scholar). Although the spectrum of drugs to which MRP1 confers resistance is similar to that of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (4Ambudkar S.V. Dey S.

For example, MRP1 but not P-gp transports a wide range of conjugated hydrophilic molecules such as the GSH conjugate leukotriene C4 (LTC4), 17β-estradiol-17-β-d-glucuronide (E217βG), and estrone 3-sulfate, as well as many other substrates, the transport of which is either stimulated by GSH or GSH-dependent (5Leier I.

Other members of the ABCC branch of the superfamily include the more recently identified MRP2 to -9 as well as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), the sulfonylurea receptors (SUR1 and SUR2), and ABCC13 (2Deeley R.G.

Structurally, the “core” region of the ABCC proteins is similar to that of many eukaryotic ABC proteins, with the exception of ABCC13, and consists of two membrane-spanning domains (MSD), each containing six transmembrane helices followed by a nucleotide binding domain (NBD). MRPs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7 and SUR1 and SUR2 are atypical among ABC proteins in that they have a third NH2-terminal MSD (MSD1) that, based on topology predictions and, in some cases, strong experimental data, contains five transmembrane helices (15Hipfner D.R.

Based on alignment with ABCC proteins lacking the third MSD, the region in cytoplasmic loop 3 begins at a location that aligns closely with the predicted NH2 terminus of the core structure of MRP1 (27Grant C.E.

In this study, we have examined the importance of the COOH-terminal region of MRP1 for the trafficking and activity of the protein. In some ABCC proteins, such as MRP2, CFTR, and SUR1, mutations in, or deletions of, their COOH-terminal regions have been shown to affect targeting to the plasma membrane (28Nies A.T. Konig J. Cui Y.

Mutations of ABC proteins that result in aberrant trafficking in mammalian cells frequently result in retention and rapid degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum (22Bakos E. Evers R. Szakacs G.

Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). This precludes analysis of their effect on the function of the protein. However, when expressed in insect cells, some of these mutant proteins are stable and active, indicating that the mutations have not caused gross perturbations in the structure of the protein (25Westlake C.J. Qian Y.M. Gao M. Vasa M. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14099-14113Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). These observations are presumed to be attributable to the lower temperatures at which the insect cells are cultured and a less stringent proofreading machinery for monitoring protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (31Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Consequently, we have carried out parallel studies of the COOH-terminal region of MRP1 using polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)-I cells to screen for mutations and deletions that affect protein trafficking and insect Sf21 cells to examine the effects of these structural alterations on protein function. In contrast to results obtained with other ABCC proteins (28Nies A.T. Konig J. Cui Y. Brom M. Spring H. Keppler D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1866-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 29Sharma N. Crane A. Clement J.P. Gonzalez G. Babenko A.P. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20628-20632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we found that removal of up to 30 amino acids from the COOH terminus had no effect on protein trafficking or binding of a substrate such as LTC4 but essentially eliminated transport activity. Furthermore, deletion of as few as 4 amino acids from the COOH terminus was sufficient to decrease activity by ∼75%. We show that this reduction in transport function is accompanied by a decrease in ATP binding and hydrolysis by NBD2 and an impaired ability to shift from a high to low affinity substrate binding state. Despite little amino acid sequence identity, transport activity can be restored by substitution of the COOH-terminal region of MRP1, with the comparable regions of MRP2 and the distantly related P-gp, indicating that the secondary and tertiary structures of these regions must be very similar. Alanine scanning mutagenesis revealed that five hydrophobic residues within the COOH-terminal region that are broadly conserved among ABC proteins are critical for activity of MRP1. Comparison of the predicted tertiary structure of MRP1 in this region with the crystal structures of distantly related ABC proteins suggests that these residues contribute to the stability of a highly conserved α-helical bundle, elements of which are in close proximity to functionally important residues in both NBDs.

Generation of MRP1 COOH-terminal Truncation and Chimeric Constructs and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Full-length MRP1 in the pFastBac (pFB) vector (pFB-MRP1) and pCDNA3.1 (pCDNA-MRP1) have been previously described (25Westlake C.J.

MRP1 NH2-(aa 1–932) and COOH-proximal (aa 932–1531) halves cloned into the pFastBac DUAL expression vector (pFBdh-MRP1) have been previously described (33Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E.

PCR was used to generate constructs lacking the COOH-terminal region of MRP1 (Fig. 1A) with pFB-MRP1 as a template. The forward primer D1241 was designed to amplify MRP1 nucleic acids upstream of the unique ClaI site at bp 4058. The reverse primers added a stop codon and a KpnI site after MRP1 codons for aa 1493, 1498, 1501, 1509, 1522, and 1527. A reverse primer was also designed to delete codons for Ser1523–Asp1527 (MRP11–1522+AGLV). The DNA products were digested with ClaI and KpnI and ligated into ClaI/KpnI pFB-MRP1 and pFBdh-MRP1, which had the COOH-terminal regions excised. The fidelity of the COOH-terminal truncated MRP1 constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Mutant MRP1 constructs were subsequently moved into NotI-KpnI-digested pCDNA3.1(-) via an EagI-KpnI digest of the pFB DNA. COOH-terminal hybrid constructs were generated by recombinant PCR. The MRP1/MRP2 COOH-terminal chimeric fragments were generated by first amplifying MRP1 nt 3152–4395 with the forward primer D1241 and the reverse primer 5′-GGTCGTCTGAATGAGGTTGTCCGTTTCCAGGTCCACGGC-3′ (MRP2 nt 4434–4417 underlined) with pFB-MRP1 as the template. The MRP2 COOH-terminal 219 base pairs were then amplified from pCDNA3.1-MRP2 (34Ito K. Oleschuk C.J. Westlake C. Vasa M.Z. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38108-38114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with the recombinant forward primer 5′-GCCGTGGACCTGGAAACGGACAACCTCATTCAGACGACC-3′ (MRP1 nt 4375–4394 underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-CACGTGGACTAGAATTTTGTGCTGTTCACATTC-3′ that contained a stop codon (TAG) after MRP2 nt 4680 incorporated into a SalI site (underlined). The MRP1/P-gp COOH-terminal fragments were generated by first amplifying MRP1 nt 3152–4527 with the forward primer D1241 and the recombinant reverse primer 5′-CTGCTGATGCGTGCCGTACTCCTGGATTTCTCC-3′ (P-gp nt 3776–2766 underlined) with pFB-MRP1 as a template. Full-length P-gp cDNA was generated by PCR with reverse transcribed A549 mRNA as a template and subsequently cloned into pFB (pFB-P-gp). The fidelity of the COOH-terminal region of P-gp was confirmed by sequencing. Amplification of the COOH-terminal 75 nt from P-gp using pFB-P-gp as a template was achieved with the forward recombinant primer 5′-CAGGAGTACGGCACGCATCAGCAGCTG C-3′ (MRP1 nt 4516–4527 underlined) and the reverse primer 5′-TATGTCGACTCACTGGCG CTTGTTCC-3′ that contained a stop codon (TAG) after the last coding sequence of P-gp followed by a SalI site (underlined). Amplified COOH-terminal DNA products for the MRP1/MRP2 and the MRP1/P-gp hybrids were denatured and permitted to anneal to the respective recombinant PCR fragments prior to the addition of deoxyribonucleotides and the Klenow fragment to polymerize the hybridized PCR fragments. The recombinant DNA was then amplified by PCR using the D1241 forward primer and the MRP2 or P-gp COOH-terminal reverse primers. Subsequently, the MRP1/MRP2 and MRP1/P-gp COOH-terminal DNA fragments were digested with ClaI and SalI and cloned into the pBluescript-KS+ (pBS) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) vector after ClaI/SalI digestion. The fidelity of the coding sequence of pBS-MRP11353–1465/MRP21473–1545 and pBS-MRP11353–1509/P-gp1255–1280 hybrid DNA were confirmed by sequencing. pBS-MRP11353–1465/MRP21473–1545 was digested with ClaI and KpnI and cloned into pFB-MRP1 as described above for the MRP1 COOH-terminal truncation constructs. MRP11–1509/P-gp1255–1280 was assembled in pBS by excising the MRP1 NH2-terminal region from pFB-MRP1 with SacI and ClaI and ligating the 4.0-kb fragment into pBS-MRP11353–1509/P-gp1255–1280 digested with SacI/ClaI. The MRP1/P-gp COOH-terminal hybrid construct in pBS was then digested with EagI/KpnI and inserted between the NotI and KpnI sites in pFB. Chimeric constructs were subsequently moved into NotI-KpnI digested pCDNA3.1(-) via an EagI-KpnI digest of the pFB DNA. All COOH-terminal mutations were generated using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). MRP1 template DNA was prepared by digesting pFB-MRP1 with EcoRI and KpnI and cloning the COOH-terminal 713 base pairs into pBS. Oligonucleotides bearing mismatched bases at the COOH-terminal residues to be mutated were generated, and mutagenesis was performed according to the instructions from the manufacturer. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. DNA fragments containing the desired mutations were cloned into the pFB-MRP1 as described above for the MRP1 COOH-terminal truncation constructs, and the fidelity of constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Expression and Localization of MRP1 in MDCK-I Cells—Generation of MDCK-I cells stably expressing COOH-terminal truncation constructs cloned into the pCDNA3.1(-) vector has been previously described (25Westlake C.J. Qian Y.M. Gao M. Vasa M. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14099-14113Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For localization studies, stable expressing MDCK-I cells were seeded on glass coverslips and polycarbonate filters and grown for 10–14 days at 37 °C to allow polarization. In some cases, after cells had polarized on glass coverslips and polycarbonate filters they were incubated at 27 °C for 48 h. Ethanol fixation of MDCK-I cells and immunofluorescent detection with the mAb MRPr1 and either the mAb anti-calnexin or a polyclonal antibody Na+/K+-ATPase have been previously described (25Westlake C.J.

To generate membrane vesicles, insect cells were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation, and the vesicles were isolated by sucrose density centrifugation (7Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. J.

Full-length wild-type and COOH-terminal truncated, mutated, and hybrid membrane proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5%), whereas dual half-expressed proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE gradient gels (7.5–15%). Immunoblots of intact proteins were probed with mAb MRPr1 (35Hipfner D.R. Gao M. Scheffer G. Scheper R.J. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Br. J.

Antibody-protein interactions were detected using horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies utilizing an enhanced chemiluminescence, and the relative expression of MRP1 fragments was determined by densitometry. LTC4 and E217βG Transport into Sf21 Membrane Vesicles—Uptake of [3H]LTC4 (50 nm) and [3H]E217βG (400 nm) was measured at 23 and 37 °C, respectively, as described previously (6Loe D.W. Almquist K.C.

Briefly, 4 μg (LTC4 uptake) or 8 μg (E217βG uptake) of Sf21 membrane vesicles were incubated with tritiated substrates in the presence of 4 mm ATP or AMP and 10 mm MgCl2 in TB (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose). ATP-dependent transport was determined by subtracting uptake in the presence of ATP from uptake in the presence of AMP. For ATP-dependent kinetic determinations, [3H]LTC4 (150 nm, 182 Ci mmol-1) uptake after 1 min was measured at different ATP or AMP concentrations (25–2000 μm) and plotted by the Hanes-Woolf method. Photoaffinity Labeling of MRP1 Constructs with [3H]LTC4 and [125I]LY475776—Labeling of MRP fragments by [3H]LTC4 and [125I]LY4775776 was carried out as described previously (24Qian Y.M. Qiu W. Gao M.

Briefly, Sf21 membrane vesicles (75 μg of protein) were incubated with 200 nm [3H]LTC4 (0.25 μCi) for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and immediately UV-irradiated at 302 nm for 30 s and repeated 10 times. For [125I]LY475776 labeling, membrane vesicles (75 μg of protein) were incubated with the MRP1 inhibitor (0.5 nm) at 37 °C for 10 min before UV irradiation for 5 min at 302 nm on ice. Vesicle proteins labeled with radioactive LTC4 and LY475776 were then resolved on SDS-PAGE (7.5%). Gels were dried for 2 h at 80 °C and exposed to film. Photolabeling of MRP1 NBDs Using 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP—8-Azido-[γ-32P]ATP and 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP photolabeling was performed as described previously (33Gao M. Cui H.R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C.

Briefly, Sf21 membrane vesicles (20 or 30 μg of protein) were incubated with 5 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in TB containing 5 mm MgCl2 for 5 min on ice, followed by UV irradiation at 302 nm for 8 min on ice. The reaction was stopped, and free radioactive nucleotide was removed by the addition of 500 μl of cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2) before centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. The wash was repeated, and the pelleted vesicles were resuspended in Laemmli buffer (4×) containing dithiothreitol (100 mm). Under conditions where MRP1 wild-type and COOH-terminal truncated proteins were proteolytically digested, UV-irradiated radioactive nucleotide-labeled vesicle proteins were resuspended in TB containing 20 ng of trypsin (1:1000) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Proteins were resolved on gradient SDS-PAGE (7.5–15%), and the gels were dried for 2 h at 80 °C before exposure to film. For Kd determinations, vesicle proteins were labeled with various concentrations of 8-azido-[α32P]ATP (1–128 μm). Densitometry was performed to determine the radioactivity incorporated into the NBDs. Because of the higher concentrations of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP that were required to saturate the COOH-terminal NBD of the truncated proteins in Kd determinations, binding was corrected for the background observed in a parallel experiment using membrane vesicles prepared from Sf21 cells infected with a β-gus expression vector.

 discusses historical and epistemological issues of the establishment of experimental physics as an academic discipline, focusing on the artificial technological character of experiment. From the mid-18th to the early 20th century, this kind of scientific experience challenged the still dominant epistemological divide between knowing and doing. Several generations of physicists were required to free the art of experiment from its epistemological stigma and to position experimental knowledge within academia. Around 1900, this interventionist character of experimental physics--particularly in microphysics--changed the physicists9 experiential basis substantially, thereby inducing an increasing self-reflexivity that even shaped the formation of different types of theoretical physics."

While the targeting signals of basolaterally destined proteins are generally cytoplasmically disposed, apical sorting signals are not typically accessible to the cytosol, and the transport machinery required for segregation and export of apical cargo remains largely unknown. Here we investigated the molecular requirements for TGN export of the apical marker influenza hemagglutinin (HA) in HeLa cells using an in vitro reconstitution assay. HA was released from the TGN in intact membrane-bound compartments, and export was dependent on addition of an ATP-regenerating system and exogenous cytosol. HA release was inhibited by guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS) as well as under conditions known to negatively regulate apical transport in vivo, including expression of the acid-activated proton channel influenza M2. Interestingly, release of HA was unaffected by depletion of ADP-ribosylation factor 1, a small GTPase that has been implicated in the recruitment of all known adaptors and coat proteins to the Golgi complex. Furthermore, regulation of HA release by GTPγS or M2 expression was unaffected by cytosolic depletion of ADP-ribosylation factor 1, suggesting that HA sorting remains functionally intact in the absence of the small GTPase. These data suggest that TGN sorting and export of influenza HA does not require classical adaptors involved in the formation of other classes of exocytic carriers and thus appears to proceed via a novel mechanism.

Newly synthesized transmembrane and secretory proteins in eukaryotic cells traverse a complex route to their final destinations. The biosynthetic pathway begins when newly synthesized proteins are translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum and ends at the trans-Golgi network (TGN), 1The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; ARF, ADP-ribosylation factor; AP, adaptor protein; COP, coatomer; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); GMP-PNP, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; HA, hemagglutinin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; VSV G, vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; GalT, β1,4-galactosyltransferase. a Golgi-associated tubular network where proteins are sorted into distinct membranous carriers. The TGN serves as a sorting station to segregate proteins destined for endosomes, lysosomes, and the plasma membrane. To add to this complexity, proteins destined for the cell surface can be sorted into distinct types of transport carriers. This additional level of sorting is most obvious in polarized epithelial cells where the plasma membrane is differentiated into discrete apical and basolateral domains. In these cells, delivery of newly synthesized apically and basolaterally destined proteins from the TGN to the cell surface is critical for the maintenance of the different protein and lipid compositions at either cell surface domain (for reviews, see Refs. 1Nelson W.J. Yeaman C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 483-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and 2Rodriguez-Boulan E. Müsch A. Le Bivic A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the distinct sorting of “apical” and “basolateral” proteins into separate carriers that bud from the TGN is recapitulated in nonpolarized epithelial cells as well as in several non-differentiated cell types including fibroblasts and Vero cells (3Müsch A.

Nonpolarized cells thus provide a useful model in which to investigate the regulation of TGN sorting and export of different classes of proteins, including markers of the apical and basolateral biosynthetic pathways. While considerable research has been directed toward dissecting the signals on cargo molecules that mediate their polarized delivery, the mechanisms by which these signals are interpreted and the machinery involved in sorting apical and basolateral proteins remain largely unknown. Basolateral targeting signals are generally localized to discrete amino acid sequences in the cytoplasmic domains of proteins. Cytosolic adaptor protein (AP) complexes recognize these motifs and link the cargo to a coat protein such as clathrin (8Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). Various AP complexes have been implicated in targeting proteins to the basolateral but not the apical surface (9Simmen T. Honing S. Icking A. Tikkanen R. Hunziker W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 10Nishimura N. Plutner H. Hahn K. Balch W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, TGN-derived vesicles containing basolaterally destined proteins are not clathrin-coated (12Liljedahl M. Maeda Y. Colanzi A. Ayala I. Van Lint J. Malhotra V. Cell. 2001; 104: 409-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). A role for coatomer in basolateral protein export has also been suggested (13Simon J.P. Shen T.H. Ivanov I.E. Gravotta D. Morimoto T. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); however, a recent report has questioned the requirement for any coats in the formation of TGN-derived basolateral carriers enriched in basolateral proteins (14Polishchuk E.V. Di Pentima A. Luini A. Polishchuk R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4470-4485Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In contrast to basolateral proteins, sorting of apically targeted proteins generally depends on motifs within the luminal or transmembrane domains, although some examples of cytoplasmically disposed apical targeting signals have also been described (15Chuang J.Z. Sung C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 16Takeda T. Yamazaki H. Farquhar M.G. Am. J.

The association of some proteins with sphingolipid-enriched microdomains or rafts in the TGN has also been proposed to direct their apical delivery (22Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) has been used extensively as a marker for the apical pathway in polarized cells. Sorting information resides within the transmembrane domain of HA, although no transferable amino acid sequence has been identified (23Tall R.D. Alonso M.A. Roth M.G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Lin S. Naim H.Y. Rodriguez A.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). HA is efficiently incorporated into lipid rafts, although the correlation between lipid raft association and polarity is unclear (23Tall R.D. Alonso M.A. Roth M.G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Lin S. Naim H.Y. Rodriguez A.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 25Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). While little is known about how this protein is packaged into apically destined vesicles at the TGN, cell surface delivery of HA is disrupted by expression of influenza M2, an acid-activated proton channel that elevates the pH of acidified intracellular compartments, including the TGN (26Henkel J.R. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6518-6524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Henkel J.R. Gibson G.A. Poland P.A. Ellis M.A. Hughey R.P. Weisz O.A. J.

To begin to identify the cytosolic requirements for the formation of apically destined vesicles from the TGN, we reconstituted ATP- and cytosol-dependent TGN export of prestaged HA in perforated HeLa cells. Our data suggest that this transport assay faithfully recapitulated in vivo requirements for efficient HA release from the TGN. Moreover we found that ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1), a small GTP-binding protein required for recruitment of adaptor and coat proteins to the Golgi complex and the TGN, was not required for efficient HA release. Additionally HA release under ARF-depleted conditions remained sensitive to selective inhibitors that disrupt HA export in the presence of ARF1, suggesting that ARF depletion does not cause rerouting of HA into alternative transport carriers. Together our data suggest that packaging and export of apical proteins does not require the assembly of known coat protein complexes.

The resultant cytosols ranged in concentration from ∼36 mg/ml (rabbit liver cytosol) to ∼12 mg/ml (rat brain cytosol) and were used in reconstitution assays at a concentration of 2 mg/ml unless otherwise stated. Immunofluorescence and Immunogold Electron Microscopy—Indirect immunofluorescence detection of giantin, AP-1, ARF1, and β-COP was performed using the method described in Ref. 35Bruns J.R.

Images were acquired using a Nikon Optiphot microscope connected to a Hamamatsu C5985 chilled CCD camera (8 bit, 756 × 483 pixels) (for epifluorescence) or a Leica DMRXE microscope (for confocal sections). Immunogold electron microscopy was performed by centrifuging the supernatants from reconstituted reactions onto Formvar-coated nickel grids at 100,000 × g for 2 min in a Beckman Airfuge centrifuge. Samples were fixed in 8% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 2 min in 0.05% Triton X-100, and then treated as described in Ref. 36Altschuler Y. Kinlough C.L. Poland P.A. Bruns J.B. Apodaca G.

Fc125 antibody was used as the primary antibody, and 10-nm colloidal gold-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the secondary antibody. Phosphotungstic acid (2%) or uranyl acetate (4%) was used as a negative stain. Protein Staging in the TGN—HeLa cells infected with replication-defective recombinant adenoviruses were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C (unless otherwise stated) in bicarbonate-free, cysteine-free, methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then metabolically radiolabeled for 10 min in the same medium supplemented with 50 μCi/ml Tran35S Label (MP Biomedicals). The medium was then replaced with cold bicarbonate-free minimal essential medium, and the cells were incubated at 19 °C for 2 h to stage newly synthesized proteins in the TGN. The dishes were then transferred to an ice-cold aluminum plate, and the cells were perforated as described below prior to reconstitution of protein export. Reconstitution of Vesicle Release from Perforated Cells—Protein export from the TGN was reconstituted using a modification of the assays described in Refs. 37Ling W.L. Siddhanta A. Shields D.

HeLa cells in 10-cm dishes were incubated for 10 min on ice in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 15 mm KCl, and the cells were then scraped into break buffer (BB; 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 90 mm KCl) using a rubber policeman. The cells were then transferred to a 15-ml conical tube, and the buffer was adjusted to 500 mm KCl by addition of an equal volume of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 m KCl. The suspension was centrifuged at 800 × g in a Beckman GS-6R centrifuge, and the cell pellet was washed with BB and then resuspended in GGA buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 38 mm potassium glutamate, 38 mm potassium aspartate, 38 mm potassium gluconate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA free acid, 1 mm dithiothreitol). During the perforation procedure, Eppendorf tubes were preloaded with GGA buffer with or without an ATP-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 50 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase (all based on final concentrations in a total assay volume of 50 μl)), cytosol (2 mg/ml final concentration), and other reagents as described in individual experiments in a final volume of 25 μl. Aliquots of the perforated cell suspension (25 μl) were distributed into these tubes, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h unless otherwise specified and then centrifuged in a tabletop microcentrifuge at 12,000 rpm for 2 min to pellet the cells. The supernatant (containing released vesicles) and pellet (cells) were collected separately. HA was immunoprecipitated from radioactive samples and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. Export of endogenous proteins from non-radiolabeled cells was analyzed by immunoblotting. Western blots were quantitated after densitometric scanning using QuantityOne software. Data were analyzed by Student's t test using SigmaStat software (Systat) unless otherwise indicated. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Protease Protection Assay—Supernatants from perforated cells reconstituted with an ATP-regenerating system and cytosol were incubated with 100 μg/ml trypsin (bovine pancreas, treated with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, Sigma) in GGA buffer on ice in the presence or absence of 0.05% Triton X-100. After 10 min, soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. The samples were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min in a Sorvall RC M120EX centrifuge. Pelleted vesicles were solubilized, and HA was immunoprecipitated from the supernatants as described in Ref. 26Henkel J.R. Weisz O.A. J. Biol.

Samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies against β-COP, ARF1, AP-1γ, and giantin. Reconstitution of HA Release from Perforated Cells—As a prelude to identifying cellular factors that regulate the TGN sorting and export of apical proteins, we tested the ability of several previously described in vitro transport assays to reconstitute the release of TGN-staged HA in epithelial cells. Our goal was to develop an assay that was reproducible, that was relatively robust, and that recapitulated in vivo sorting in the TGN. Although we could reconstitute pH-sensitive HA release from mechanically perforated polarized MDCK cells (27Henkel J.R. Gibson G.A. Poland P.A. Ellis M.A. Hughey R.P. Weisz O.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), vesicle release in this assay was inefficient, and the degree of perforation obtained was inconsistent. Reconstitution of HA release from isolated Golgi preparations purified from polarized MDCK cells was both efficient and reproducible but did not recapitulate physiological properties of sorting observed in vivo. 2M. A. Ellis and O. A. Weisz, unpublished observations. However, we found that release of TGN-staged HA from hypo-osmotically swelled, perforated HeLa cells was relatively robust, reproducible, and sensitive to conditions that inhibit HA transport in vivo. HeLa cells expressing HA were metabolically radiolabeled for 10 min, and newly synthesized HA was staged in the TGN by incubation for 2 h at 19 °C. Subsequently the cells were perforated by swelling and scraping, and vesicle release was reconstituted in the presence or absence of an ATP-regenerating system and cytosol. As shown in Fig. 1A, release of HA was robust only when both ATP and cytosol were present. The efficiency of HA release was dependent on the concentration of cytosol with maximal release observed at 2 mg/ml (Fig. 2A). Moreover, using this assay, we observed similar kinetics of HA release when transport was reconstituted using either rat brain or rabbit liver cytosol (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Kinetics and cytosol dose dependence of HA release. A, HA release from permeabilized HeLa cells was reconstituted for 1 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of rat brain cytosol. *, p = 0.002 compared with ATP alone; n = 9. B, the kinetics of HA release were monitored in perforated HeLa cells incubated with 2 mg/ml rat brain cytosol (RBC) or rabbit liver cytosol (RLC). Cyto, cytosol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm that HA release in this assay was not due to nonselective fragmentation of the Golgi/TGN upon reconstitution, we examined the release of Golgi residents in this assay. Reconstitution of vesicle release did not dislodge the Golgi-associated peripheral membrane protein GM130 (Fig. 1A). In addition, we did not observe measurable release of p58-YFP or the trans-Golgi marker GalT-YFP. However, release of TGN46, a TGN protein that constitutively cycles via the TGN and the basolateral cell surface of polarized MDCK cells (40Rajasekaran A.K. Humphrey J.S. Wagner M. Miesenbock G. Le Bivic A. Bonifacino J.S. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was very efficiently reconstituted in the presence of ATP and cytosol (Fig. 1A). Efficient release of this protein from purified rat liver Golgi membranes has been reported previously by another group (41McLauchlan H.J. James J. Lucocq J.M. Ponnambalam S. Cell Biol. Int. 2001; 25: 705-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The release of TGN46 in our assay likely represents release of this protein from the TGN as opposed to the budding of endocytic vesicles from the cell surface because 1) this protein localizes to the TGN in HeLa cells at steady state and after incubation at 19 °C and 2) the small population of TGN46 that can be biotinylated at the plasma membrane at steady state was not released into the medium upon cell perforation and reconstitution. 2M. A. Ellis and O. A. Weisz, unpublished observations. We also used immunofluorescence microscopy to examine the effect of perforation and reconstitution on the morphology and localization of the Golgi complex/TGN. Staining with antibodies directed against the Golgi-resident protein giantin and the TGN-localized AP-1 complex demonstrated that these compartments remain concentrated in the perinuclear region of perforated cells after reconstitution, similar to their localization in intact cells (Fig. 1B). A prediction of our assay is that TGN-staged HA should be released in intact membrane-bound carriers. To test this, we first combined immunoelectron microscopy with negative staining to visualize the membranes of released carriers containing HA. Released transport carriers were fixed and processed for visualization of HA-positive structures. Anti-HA antibodies localized to membrane-limited, spherical vesicles with an average diameter of 86 ± 13 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 47; Fig. 3A). To examine the topology of released HA, we examined whether the protease-sensitive luminal domain was protected from trypsin cleavage. Supernatants from a transport reconstitution experiment were incubated with trypsin in the presence or absence of Triton X-100 and then centrifuged at high speed to pellet membrane-bound vesicles (Fig. 3B). In the absence of detergent, cleavage of HA was virtually undetectable, and nearly all of the protein was recovered intact in the pelleted vesicle fraction. By contrast, when Triton X-100 was included, HA was efficiently cleaved and was recovered primarily in the supernatant. Nucleotide Dependence of HA Release—A number of GTPases have been implicated in the delivery of HA from the TGN to the plasma membrane, including ARF1 and Gsα (42Pimplikar S.W. Simons K. Nature. 1993; 362: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 43Gravotta D. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2893-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether there is a requirement for GTP or GTP hydrolysis in HA release, we tested the effect of poorly hydrolyzable GTP analogs in our assay (44Stumber M. Herrmann C. Wohlgemuth S. Kalbitzer H.R. Jahn W. Geyer M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3270-3278Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Inclusion of GTPγS in the reconstitution reaction decreased HA release in a dose-dependent manner with complete inhibition of ATP-dependent release observed at 100 μm concentration (Fig. 4A). However, the more poorly hydrolyzable GTP analog GMP-PNP did not inhibit HA release even at high concentration (Fig. 4C). Neither GTPγS nor GMP-PNP affected TGN46 release at 100 μm concentration, indicating that GTP hydrolysis is not required for efficient release of TGN46 from the TGN (Fig. 4, B and D). HA Release Is Sensitive to in Vivo Perturbants of Biosynthetic Traffic—We have observed previously that disruption of TGN pH by expression of the acid-activated ion channel influenza M2 selectively inhibits efficient release of apical proteins including HA from the TGN in intact MDCK and HeLa cells (26Henkel J.R.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To examine whether this requirement for acidic TGN luminal pH is preserved in our perforated cell assay system, we examined HA release in HeLa cells co-infected with adenovirus encoding either M2 or as a control M2 in the reverse orientation. After radiolabeling and incubation at 19 °C, cells were perforated, and transport was reconstituted. One set of M2-containing samples was reconstituted in the presence of the M2 channel blocker amantadine. HA release in perforated cells expressing active M2 was decreased by roughly 50% relative to HA release observed in control cells (Fig. 5A). Moreover the effect of M2 on HA release was abrogated by inclusion of amantadine in the reconstitution mixture. The effect of M2 on HA release was reproducible and statistically significant (p < 0.001 versus control cells and p = 0.04 versus M2-expressing cells reconstituted in the presence of amantadine by paired t test analysis of nine independent experiments). By contrast, release of the basolaterally targeted protein TGN46 was unaffected by expression of active M2 (Fig. 5B). In the experiment shown, a slight inhibition was observed in the presence"

The general stoichiometry of the receptor complex, which is believed to be one molecule each of TCRα, TCRβ, CD3γ, and CD3δ and two molecules each of CD3ϵ and CD3ζ, is not clearly understood. Although it has been shown that there are two chains of CD3ϵ and CD3ζ, the stoichiometry of CD3γ or CD3δ chains in the surface antigen receptor complex has not been determined. In the present study, transgenic mice expressing an altered form of mouse CD3δ and CD3γ were employed to show that the surface TCR complexes contain one molecule each of CD3δ and CD3γ. Thymocytes from wild type and CD3 chain transgenic mice on the appropriate knockout background were surface-biotinylated and immunoprecipitated using a specific antibody. The immunoprecipitates were resolved in two dimensions under nonreducing/reducing conditions to determine the stoichiometry of CD3δ and CD3γ in the surface antigen receptor complex. Our data clearly show the presence of one molecule each of CD3δ and CD3γ in the surface TCR/CD3 complex.

The TCR 1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell antigen receptor; GS, γ stop; DS, δ stop; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MHC, major histocompatibility complex.1The abbreviations used are: TCR, T cell antigen receptor; GS, γ stop; DS, δ stop; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; MHC, major histocompatibility complex./CD3 complex is multimeric and consists of a covalently linked heterodimer of polymorphic TCRα and β glycoproteins and noncovalently associated invariant CD3γ, δ, ϵ, and ζ chains. Individual CD3 chains contain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in their cytoplasmic domain. The TCR/CD3 receptor complex recognizes a peptide antigen presented by MHC molecules expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. The engagement of the surface receptor complex to its ligand results in signal transduction and is most likely mediated by CD3 chains via phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (1Sebzda E. Mariathasan S. Ohteki T. Jones R. Bachmann M.F. Ohashi P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 829-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 2Malissen B. Ardouin L. Lin S. Gillet A. Malissen M. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 72: 103-148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of multiple CD3 chains has been suggested to amplify a signal generated by TCR-peptide/MHC interactions resulting in diverse outcomes, for instance, positive versus negative selection of developing thymocytes. In addition to signal transduction, the CD3 components play a crucial role in the receptor complex assembly, stability, and transport to the cell surface as well as ligand-induced surface receptor internalization. Furthermore, it has been suggested that engagement of the surface receptor complex by a single molecule of peptide/MHC is sufficient to elicit a cytotoxic T cell response (3Sykulev Y. Joo M. Vturina I. Tsomides T. Eisen H.N. Immunity. 1996; 4: 565-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). A single peptide/MHC complex could engage multiple TCR complexes in a serial manner, as suggested by Lanzavecchia and colleagues (4Valitutti S. Muller S. Cella M. Padovan E. Lanzavecchia A. Nature. 1995; 375: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar, 5Viola A. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1996; 273: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). This would imply that CD3 chains present in a single TCR complex are capable of recruiting sufficient numbers of intracellular signaling molecules, leading to T cell activation. This could be achieved by altering the conformation of the receptor, as has recently been shown by Alarcon and colleagues (6Gil D. Schamel W.W. Montoya M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Alarcon B. Cell. 2002; 109: 901-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Following TCR/ligand engagement, recruitment of an adaptor protein, Nck, to the proline-rich sequence in the cytoplasmic domain of CD3ϵ has been suggested to alter the conformation of the receptor complex, leading to T cell activation (6Gil D. Schamel W.W. Montoya M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Alarcon B. Cell. 2002; 109: 901-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 7Davis M.M. Cell. 2002; 110: 285-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Since CD3 chains are central to the TCR assembly, transport, and signal transduction, it is important to understand their stoichiometry in the receptor complex. The exact stoichiometry of all the components of the TCR/CD3 complex is not clear. A widely accepted octameric model of TCR/CD3 complex proposes that there are two molecules each of CD3ϵ and ζ chains and one molecule each of CD3γ, δ, TCRα, and β chains (8Blumberg R.S. Ley S.

The model is further supported by data from Al Singer and his group (13Kearse K.P. Roberts J.L. Singer A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 391-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), who have suggested that CD3γϵ and CD3δϵ heterodimers preferentially associate with TCRβ and TCRα chains, respectively. Recent reports by Call et al. (14Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 15Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wucherpfennig K.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2348-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) also support an octameric model of the TCR/CD3 complex. Using an in vitro translation system, these authors propose that a basic residue in the transmembrane domains of TCRα and TCRβ chain interact with acidic residues in the transmembrane domains of CD3δϵ and γϵ heterodimers, respectively (14Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wiedmann M. Wucherpfennig K.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 967-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 15Call M.E. Pyrdol J. Wucherpfennig K.W. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2348-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Analysis of the assembled TCR/CD3 complex using this experimental system strongly supports the octameric model of TCR/CD3 stoichiometry. However, these data do not address the stoichiometry of the surface TCR/CD3 complex, which is central to the T cell development and function following ligand engagement. Further, cell-free systems do not address the possibility that processing of complex carbohydrates on glycoproteins (TCRα, TCRβ, CD3γ, and CD3δ are glycoproteins) may influence the stoichiometry of the surface complex. For instance, tunicamycin treatment of Jurkat T cells, which disrupts protein glycosylation, has been shown to prevent assembly of CD3δ into the receptor complex (16Dietrich J. Neisig A. Hou X. Wegener A.K. Gajhede M. Geisler C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 132: 299-310Google Scholar).A possibility that the surface receptor complex may contain multivalent TCR/CD3 complexes has been supported by recent biochemical and crystallographic data. It has been shown that there could exist at least three molecules of CD3ϵ chain (17Thibault G. Bardos P. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3814-3820PubMed Google Scholar) and two molecules of TCRβ chain (and by extension, the TCRα chain) (17Thibault G. Bardos P. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 3814-3820PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fernandez-Miguel G. Alarcon B. Iglesias A. Bluethmann H. Alvarez-Mon M. Sanz E. de la Hera A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Based on these data, a decameric model of TCR/CD3 complex stoichiometry has been proposed (19Jacobs H. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 565-569PubMed Google Scholar). According to this model, there are two molecules each of CD3ϵ, CD3ζ, TCRα, and TCRβ chains and one molecule each of CD3γ and CD3δ. The presence of two molecules of each TCR chain was further supported by the crystal structure of variable domains of TCR chains. The crystal structure was shown to contain four TCR chains representing two heterodimers of TCRα and β chains (20Fields B.A. Ober B. Malchiodi E.L. Lebedeva M.I. Braden B.C. Ysern X. Kim J.K. Shao X.

Two TCR heterodimers were proposed to interact with a dimer of MHC class II complex (22Brown J.H. Jardetzky T.S. Gorga J.C. Stern L.J. Urban R.G. Strominger J.L. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1993; 364: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). The presence of four TCR chains and their preferential association with specific CD3 heterodimers raises questions about the stoichiometry of CD3γ and CD3δ chains. These data suggest that there could be two chains each of CD3γ and CD3δ in the receptor complex. Both CD3γ and CD3δ are glycoproteins and play an important role in TCR assembly and signal transduction. Mice deficient in either CD3γ or CD3δ exhibit a blockade in development at the double negative and double positive stage, respectively (23Dave V.P. Cao Z. Browne C. Alarcon B. Fernandez-Miguel G. Lafaille J. de la Hera A. Tonegawa S. Kappes D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1360-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 24Delgado P. Fernandez E. Dave V.P. Kappes D. Alarcon B.

In the absence of CD3δ, the TCRαβCD3ϵγ complex is formed quite efficiently (23Dave V.P. Cao Z. Browne C. Alarcon B. Fernandez-Miguel G. Lafaille J. de la Hera A. Tonegawa S. Kappes D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1360-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, the CD3δ-deficient TCR complex failed to associate with CD3ζ chain, resulting in an inefficient transport to the cell surface (23Dave V.P. Cao Z. Browne C. Alarcon B. Fernandez-Miguel G. Lafaille J. de la Hera A. Tonegawa S. Kappes D.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1360-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These data indicated that, at least intracellularly, CD3γ, and possibly CD3δ, could associate with either of the TCR chains. Thus, a small number of TCR/CD3 complex expressed on T cell surface in either CD3γ–/– or CD3δ–/– mice could contain more than one molecule of CD3δ or CD3γ, respectively. Similarly, cell line studies have shown that CD3γϵ and CD3δϵ heterodimers could associate with either of the TCR chains, further supporting the multivalent structure of the TCR/CD3 complex (26Jose E.S. Sahuquillo A.G. Bragado R. Alarcon B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Kappes D.J. Tonegawa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10619-10623Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Irrespective of whether CD3γ and CD3δ chains associate preferentially or randomly with TCR chains, if there are two molecules each of TCRα and -β chains, there exists a possibility that there could be two molecules each of CD3γ and CD3δ in a given TCR/CD3 complex. In this report, we have attempted to dissect the stoichiometry of CD3δ and CD3γ chains in the surface TCR/CD3 complex. Using CD3δ and CD3γ transgenic mice combined with specific immunoprecipitation of the surface-labeled TCR/CD3 complex, we show biochemically that the majority of the surface TCR/CD3 complexes contain a single chain of CD3δ and CD3γ per TCR complex.MATERIALS AND METHODSMice—CD3δ–/– and CD3γ–/– mice have been described previously (23Dave V.P.

Truncated CD3δ (δ stop, or DS) and CD3γ (γ stop, or GS) transgenic constructs were engineered by amplifying mouse cDNA using specific primers. The primers were designed to introduce a stop codon immediately after the transmembrane region of the two proteins. The amplified cDNA products were cloned into a TA cloning vector, sequenced, and subsequently subcloned into a human CD2 expression cassette, which ensures expression throughout T cell ontogeny (28Zhumabekove T. Corbella P. Tolaini M. Kioussis D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 185: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The final construct was separated from the vector sequence by restriction enzyme digestion, gel-purified, and injected into fertilized mouse eggs. Founder mice were identified by Southern blot and/or PCR techniques. Initially, DS and GS transgenes were introduced in CD3δ–/– and CD3γ–/– background, respectively. The DS+δ–/– and GS+γ–/– transgenic mice were backcrossed for 2–3 generations to obtain DS+GS+δ–/– or DS+GS+γ–/– mice. C57Bl/6 mice were used as control. All mice were bred and maintained in a specific pathogen-free animal facility at the IRCM.Antibodies—2C11 is a hamster monoclonal antibody that recognizes mouse CD3γϵ and CD3δϵ heterodimers and was purified from hybridoma culture supernatant on a protein A-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Rabbit polyclonal serum, R9, was a kind gift of Lawrence Samelson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). R9 recognizes the cytoplasmic tail of 26-kDa mouse and human CD3δ protein. Anti-CD3γ and anti-CD3ϵ rabbit polyclonal sera were a generous gift of Ed Palmer (University Hospital-Basel, Switzerland). HMT3.2 antibody, which recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of CD3γ and CD3δ, was a gift from Balbino Alarcon (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain) or purified from hybridoma culture supernatant. Anti-CD4-phycoerythrine, anti-CD8-fluorescein isothiocyanate, anti-TCR-cychrome antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen. Purified rabbit anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate, and goat anti-mouse IgG-cyanine5 antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA. Thymocytes and lymph node cells were stained with a panel of antibodies and analyzed using a FACSCaliber.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—One-two hundred million thymocytes were lysed in 1% digitonin or Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, iodoacetamide (1.8 mg/ml), and a mixture of protease inhibitors (aprotinin, pepstatin, leupeptin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride). Cells were lysed for 45 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The post-nuclear supernatant was incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The precleared lysate was immunoprecipitated using antibody-coated protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed twice with ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% detergent) followed by ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoprecipitates were eluted in the protein sample loading buffer (62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and bromphenol blue) and electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred onto Immobilon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk powder in TBST buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20), and probed with the appropriate antibody, and bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated protein A and chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were stripped in buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris·HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 1 h, washed 4–6 times in TBST buffer, and reprobed.Surface Biotinylation—Thymocytes were washed in Hank's balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm CaCl2, suspended in 1 ml of wash buffer and cooled on ice for 20 min. Surface proteins were biotinylated for 20 min on ice by adding sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml. The biotinylation reaction was terminated by adding Hank's balanced salt solution containing 25 mm lysine monochloride. The biotinylated thymocytes were washed twice with lysine monochloride/Hank's buffered saline solution, and the viability of the labeled cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion. More than 98% of the labeled thymocytes were found to be viable. Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated as described above, and separated on a 13% tube gel under nonreducing conditions. The tube gels were equilibrated with protein loading dye containing 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at 37 °C with mild shaking. The tube gels were then loaded onto 13% SDS-PAGE gel for electrophoresis in the second dimension. The resolved proteins were transferred onto Immobilon membrane, blocked in 5% milk/phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and probed with HRP-avidin (Sigma). Bands were visualized with the chemiluminescence system described above.RESULTSMouse Surface TCR Complexes Contain Only One Molecule of CD3δ Protein—To test the stoichiometry of mouse CD3δ, we took advantage of CD3γ-deficient, cytoplasmic domain truncated CD3δ (DS) and CD3γ transgenic (GS) mice. As mentioned earlier, CD3γ and CD3δ deficiency blocks thymocyte development at the double negative and double positive stage, respectively. This suggests that these two mouse proteins, although homologous to each other, do not substitute for each other for thymocyte maturation.We have shown that the DS transgene restores thymocyte development in CD3δ-deficient mice (24Delgado P. Fernandez E. Dave V.P. Kappes D. Alarcon B. Nature. 2000; 406: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Likewise, the GS transgene restores thymocyte development in CD3γ-deficient mice. 2Q. Pan, A. S. Gollapudi, and V. P. Dave, unpublished observation. To test the stoichiometry of CD3δ, we introduced the DS and GS transgenes into a CD3γ-deficient background. Thus, the DS+GS+γ–/– mouse expresses two forms of the CD3δ chain, one full-length endogenous and one truncated transgenic. The presence of a truncated form of the CD3γ chain in the CD3γ-deficient background ensures that thymocyte development is normal and that these cells express only one form of the CD3γ chain. Since one of the CD3δ molecules is devoid of the cytoplasmic tail, it is not possible to test the presence of two CD3δ chains in immunoprecipitates of total lysates in Western blot using R9 serum (as the serum cannot recognize the DS protein). Further, since the engagement of the surface receptor complex to its ligand is crucial for T cell development and function, it is important to dissect the stoichiometry of the surface TCR/CD3 complex. To this end, thymocytes from wild type, GS+γ–/–, and DS+GS+γ–/– mice were surface-biotinylated, lysed in 1% Triton X-100 buffer, and immunoprecipitated using either HMT3.2 or 2C11 monoclonal antibody. HMT3.2 recognizes the cytoplasmic domain of mouse CD3γ and CD3δ (30Hayes S.M. Laky K. El-Khoury D. Kappes D. Fowlkes B.J. Love P.E. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1355-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the antibody will immunoprecipitate only those TCR complexes that contain endogenous CD3δ. Fig. 1A shows a schematic of possible outcomes of HMT3.2 and 2C11 immunoprecipitation of only DS+GS+γ–/– thymocytes. Thus, HMT3.2 immunoprecipitates will show either three or four CD3-specific bands depending on whether there are one or two chains of CD3δ in a TCR complex. The immunoprecipitates were resolved under nonreduced and reduced conditions in the first and second dimensions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1B, panel C, HMT3.2 immunoprecipitates of the DS+GS+γ–/– thymocytes show GS-, CD3ϵ-, and CD3δ-specific, but not DS-specific, bands (for simplicity, only CD3-specific bands are shown in all the figures). In contrast, 2C11 immunoprecipitates of the DS+GS+γ–/– thymocytes show GS-, CD3ϵ-, CD3δ-, and DS-specific bands (Fig. 1C, panel C). Comparable amounts of endogenous CD3δ and DS proteins could be immunoprecipitated with 2C11. Immunoprecipitates of wild type and GS+γ–/– mice show the position of endogenous proteins and the truncated protein with both the antibodies (Fig. 1, B and C, panel B). The presence of only the endogenous, but not truncated, CD3δ in HMT3.2 immunoprecipitates strongly indicates that there is only one CD3δ chain per TCR complex.CD3γ Is Also Present as a Monomer in the Surface TCR/CD3 Complexes—The above described data clearly show that the majority of TCR complexes contain only a single molecule of the CD3δ chain. To test whether a TCR complex contains one molecule of CD3γ as well, we introduced the DS and GS transgenes into CD3δ–/– background. Thus, T cells from DS+GS+δ–/– mice will express two forms of CD3γ (one endogenous and one truncated) and only a truncated form of CD3δ. Fig. 2A shows a schematic of the CD3γ stoichiometry experiment. In this case, HMT3.2 will immunoprecipitate only those TCR complexes that contain the endogenous CD3γ (Fig. 2A). Thus, we immunoprecipitated surface-biotinylated thymocytes from wild type, DS+δ–/–, and DS+GS+δ–/– mice with HMT3.2 or 2C11. As shown in Fig. 2B, panel C, HMT3.2 immunoprecipitates of the DS+GS+δ–/– thymocytes show only full-length CD3γ along with truncated CD3δ and endogenous CD3ϵ proteins. As expected, 2C11 immunoprecipitates all four proteins, which are wild type CD3γ, GS, DS, and CD3ϵ, from the lysate of DS+GS+δ–/– thymocytes (Fig. 2C, panel C). As shown here, comparable amounts of endogenous CD3γ and GS proteins could be immunoprecipitated with 2C11. The presence of only endogenous CD3γ in HMT3.2 immunoprecipitates suggests the existence of one CD3γ chain per TCR complex. All these data indicate that the surface TCR complex contains only one molecule each of CD3δ and CD3γ.Fig. 2Monomeric stoichiometry of CD3γ. A, schematic presentation of the possible stoichiometry of CD3γ in DS+GS+δ–/– mice and the number of bands expected on avidin blots of HMT3.2 and 2C11 immunoprecipitates of surface-biotinylated receptor complexes. The presence of only one chain of CD3γ per TCR complex will result in two types of TCR/CD3 complexes in DS+GS+δ–/– mice. HMT3.2 will immunoprecipitate only type-A TCR complexes containing endogenous CD3γ resulting in three bands (CD3γ, DS, and CD3ϵ) on an avidin blot. On the other hand, dimeric CD3γ stoichiometry will result in three types of receptor complexes (type-C, -D, and -E). HMT3.2 will immunoprecipitate endogenous CD3γ containing type-C and -D complexes resulting in four bands (CD3γ, DS, GS, and CD3ϵ) on an avidin blot. 2C11 immunoprecipitate will show four CD3 chain-specific bands in both situations. B and C, the presence of a single molecule of CD3γ in the surface TCR complex. Thymocytes from wild type (WT), DS+δ–/–, and DS+GS+δ–/– mice were surface-biotinylated, lysed, and immunoprecipitated using either HMT3.2 (B) or 2C11 (C), resolved on a two-dimensional gel, transferred onto nylon membrane, and probed with HRP-avidin and ECL. HMT3.2 immunoprecipitates show three bands, indicating the presence of one molecule of CD3γ per TCR complex. As expected, 2C11 immunoprecipitates show four bands.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Although the above data strongly suggest that surface TCR complexes contain only one chain each of CD3δ and CD3γ, we wished to ascertain that this was not due to the experimental conditions employed. We predicted that if the surface TCR complexes indeed contain only one molecule each of CD3δ and CD3γ, then it should be possible to immunoprecipitate two sets of TCR/CD3 complexes from the double transgenic mice. One set of TCR complexes will contain endogenous CD3δ, and the other set will contain the truncated CD3δ (DS) on DS+GS+γ–/– thymocytes (Fig. 1A). Similarly, TCR complexes will contain either endogenous or truncated CD3γ on DS+GS+δ–/– thymocytes (Fig. 2A). Thus, we should be able to immunoprecipitate all of the endogenous CD3δ-containing complexes with HMT3.2 and the remaining complexes containing truncated CD3δ with 2C11. To test this, we carried out sequential immunoprecipitation of biotinylated surface TCR/CD3 complexes. Lysates of biotinylated surface receptor complexes were immunoprecipitated sequentially four times with HMT3.2 antibody and finally with 2C11. Fig. 3 shows avidin blots of the first HMT3.2 and final 2C11 sequential immunoprecipitations of wild type (panels A and B), DS+GS+γ–/– (panels C and D), and DS+GS+δ–/– (panels E and F) thymocytes. As shown, HMT3.2 immunoprecipitated only wild type CD3δ-, GS-, and CD3ϵ-containing TCR complexes from DS+GS+γ–/– thymocytes (panel C). Similarly, HMT3.2 immunoprecipitated only wild type CD3γ-, DS-, and CD3ϵ-containing TCR complexes from DS+GS+δ–/– thymocytes (panel E). The remaining TCR complexes containing only the truncated proteins along with CD3ϵ from DS+GS+γ–/– and DS+GS+δ–/– thymocytes could be immunoprecipitated by 2C11 (panels D and F).Fig. 3Sequential immunoprecipitation of TCR/CD3 complexes from DS+GS+γ–/– and DS+GS+δ–/– mice supports a stoichiometry of one CD3δ and one CD3γ chain per TCR complex. Surface-biotinylated TCR complexes from wild type (WT), DS+GS+γ–/–, and DS+GS+δ–/– mice were immunoprecipitated four times with HMT3.2 antibody followed by 2C11 antibody. The first HMT3.2 (A, C, and E) and final 2C11 (B, D, and F) immunoprecipitates of wild type (A and B), DS+GS+γ–/– (C and D), and DS+GS+δ–/– (E and F) thymocytes were resolved on a two-dimensional gel, blotted, and probed with HRP-avidin. TCR/CD3 complexes containing only the endogenous CD3δ or CD3γ could be immunoprecipitated by HMT3.2 antibody (C and E), whereas those containing only the truncated proteins could be immunoprecipitated by 2C11 (D and F) from lysates of double transgenic thymocytes as shown by the detection of only three bands in all the immunoprecipitates. The absence of any bands in 2C11 immunoprecipitates of wild type mice (B) indicates the complete preclearing of endogenous CD3δ- and/or CD3γ-containing TCR complexes by HMT3.2. These data clearly show that the surface receptors contain one chain of CD3γ and CD3δ per TCR complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn the present investigation, we have attempted to address the stoichiometry of CD3δ and CD3γ in the surface TCR/CD3 complex. CD3δ and CD3γ play an important role in intracellular assembly and transport of TCR/CD3 complexes to the cell surface as well as signal transduction and receptor internalization following ligand engagement. Several reports suggest that TCRα and TCRβ chains preferentially associate with CD3δϵ and CD3γϵ heterodimers, respectively (8Blumberg R.S. Ley S. Sancho J. Lonberg N. Lacy E. McDermott F. Schad V.
