https://openalex.org/W2080843536,"Allometric scaling relations, including the 3/4 power law for metabolic rates, are characteristic of all organisms and are here derived from a general model that describes how essential materials are transported through space-filling fractal networks of branching tubes. The model assumes that the energy dissipated is minimized and that the terminal tubes do not vary with body size. It provides a complete analysis of scaling relations for mammalian circulatory systems that are in agreement with data. More generally, the model predicts structural and functional properties of vertebrate cardiovascular and respiratory systems, plant vascular systems, insect tracheal tubes, and other distribution networks."
https://openalex.org/W2093164547,"Ocean microstructure data show that turbulent mixing in the deep Brazil Basin of the South Atlantic Ocean is weak at all depths above smooth abyssal plains and the South American Continental Rise. The diapycnal diffusivity there was estimated to be less than or approximately equal to 0.1 x 10(-4) meters squared per second. In contrast, mixing rates are large throughout the water column above the rough Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and the diffusivity deduced for the bottom-most 150 meters exceeds 5 x 10(-4) meters squared per second. Such patterns in vertical mixing imply that abyssal circulations have complex spatial structures that are linked to the underlying bathymetry."
https://openalex.org/W2081030911,The three-dimensional structure of the dimeric transmembrane domain of glycophorin A (GpA) was determined by solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of a 40-residue peptide solubilized in aqueous detergent micelles. The GpA membrane-spanning helices cross at an angle of –40 degrees and form a small but well-packed interface that lacks intermonomer hydrogen bonds. The structure provides an explanation for the previously characterized sequence dependence of GpA dimerization and demonstrates that van der Waals interactions alone can mediate stable and specific associations between transmembrane helices.
https://openalex.org/W2019125570,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae BNI1 gene product (Bni1p) is a member of the formin family of proteins, which participate in cell polarization, cytokinesis, and vertebrate limb formation. During mating pheromone response, bni1 mutants showed defects both in polarized morphogenesis and in reorganization of the underlying actin cytoskeleton. In two-hybrid experiments, Bni1p formed complexes with the activated form of the Rho-related guanosine triphosphatase Cdc42p, with actin, and with two actin-associated proteins, profilin and Bud6p (Aip3p). Both Bni1p and Bud6p (like Cdc42p and actin) localized to the tips of mating projections. Bni1p may function as a Cdc42p target that links the pheromone response pathway to the actin cytoskeleton."

The total amount of secondary organic aerosol produced from the atmospheric oxidation of whole gasoline vapor can be represented as the sum of the contributions of the individual aromatic molecular constituents of the fuel. The urban atmospheric, anthropogenic hydrocarbon profile is approximated well by evaporated whole gasoline, and thus these results suggest that it is possible to model atmospheric secondary organic aerosol formation."
https://openalex.org/W2078877797,"The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the cytosol leads to increased expression of heat-shock proteins, while accumulation of such proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stimulates the expression of many ER resident proteins, most of which function as molecular chaperones. Recently, inhibitors of the proteasome have been identified that can block the rapid degradation of abnormal cytosolic and ER-associated proteins. We therefore tested whether these agents, y causing the accumulation of abnormal proteins, might stimulate the expression of cytosolic heat-shock proteins and/or ER molecular chaperones and thereby induce thermotolerance. Exposure of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells to various proteasome inhibitors, including the peptide aldehydes (MG132, MG115, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal) and lactacystin, inhibited the degradation of short-lived proteins and increased markedly the levels of mRNAs encoding cytosolic heat-shock proteins (Hsp70, polyubiquitin) and ER chaperones (BiP, Grp94, ERp72), as shown by Northern blot analysis. However, inhibitors of cysteine proteases (E64), serine proteases (leupeptin), or metalloproteases (1,10-phenanthroline) had no effect on the levels of these mRNAs. The relative efficacies of the peptide aldehyde inhibitors in inducing these mRNAs correlated with their potencies against the proteasome. Furthermore, reduction of the aldehyde group of MG132 decreased its inhibitory effect on proteolysis and largely prevented the induction of these mRNAs. Although treatment with the proteasome inhibitors caused rapid increases in mRNA levels (as early as 2 h after treatment with MG132), the inhibitors did not detectably affect total protein synthesis, total protein secretion, ER morphology, or the retention of ER-lumenal proteins, even after 18 h of treatment. Together, the findings suggest that inhibition of proteasome function induces heat-shock proteins and ER chaperones due to the accumulation of sufficient amounts of abnormal proteins and/or the inhibition of degradation of a key regulatory factor (e.g. heat-shock factor). Since expression of heat-shock proteins can protect cells from thermal injury, we tested whether the proteasome inhibitors might also confer thermotolerance. Treatment of cells with MG132 for as little as 2 h, markedly increased the survival of cells subjected to high temperatures (up to 46°C). Thus, these agents may have applications in protecting against cell injury.

Thus, these agents may have applications in protecting against cell injury. The cellular “heat-shock response,” manifested by increased expression of heat-shock proteins, represents a basic defense mechanism employed by cells to protect themselves against high temperature and various other injurious conditions (1Welch W.J.

Most of the major heat-shock proteins function as molecular chaperones involved in the folding, assembly, and/or degradation of proteins and therefore appear to prevent the accumulation of aggregated, misfolded, or damaged proteins in the affected cell (1Welch W.J.

Similarly, conditions that perturb folding or glycosylation of surface or secreted proteins cause a buildup of misfolded proteins in the ER, which appears to be a common signal, at least indirectly, for the increased expression of the ER chaperones (8Mori K.

The proteasome is the major neutral proteolytic apparatus in the cell and is an essential component of the ATP-dependent degradative pathway (10Goldberg A.L.

J. 1993; 291: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Recent studies with inhibitors in lymphoblasts suggest that the proteasome is responsible not only for the degradation of many rapidly turned-over proteins, but also for the bulk of other proteins (17Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). The degradation of misfolded proteins transiting the ER is less well understood, although at least in the case of one transmembrane protein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, the proteasome appears to be involved (18Jensen T.J.

Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar) inhibitors of the 20 S proteasome have been identified that can enter mammalian cells and inhibit degradation of proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. One group of such inhibitors are peptide aldehydes (e.g. carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132)) which reversibly bind to active sites and inhibit cleavage of hydrophobic or acidic substrates (17Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). A more specific inhibitor is the naturally occurring bacterial compound, lactacystin, which covalently modifies threonine residues in the proteasome's active site and does not seem to affect any other known protease (20Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). Such agents can inhibit protein degradation (17Rock K.L. Gramm C.

Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar) in a variety of mammalian cells and have been widely used to probe the physiological function of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Since the blockage of protein breakdown in the cell (e.g. by inhibition of proteasomes) should lead to an accumulation in cells of proteins otherwise targeted for degradation, it seemed likely that these agents might also signal the induction of the cytosolic and/or ER chaperones. To test this possibility, we examined the ability of several types of protease inhibitors to increase the levels of mRNA encoding the cytosolic heat-shock proteins (i.e. Hsp70 and polyubiquitin) and/or the ER chaperones (i.e. BiP, Grp94, and ERp72). In addition to specific inhibitors of the proteasome, we also studied the effects of an inhibitor of cysteine proteases (such as lysosomal cathepsins B, H, and L and calpains) and a metal chelating agent that inhibits metalloproteases. These other inhibitors have also been reported to affect the degradation of certain ER proteins (21Inoue S. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9080-9086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wileman T. Kane L.P. Carson G.R. Terhorst C. J. Biol.

Ivessa N.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, in our studies, only those agents which have been reported to inhibit the activity of the proteasome (17Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar, 20Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar) were able to consistently stimulate expression of mRNAs for heat-shock proteins and ER chaperones. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition was found to protect cells from subsequent thermal injury, a finding that may have broad implications, not only for the interpretation of experimental studies using these inhibitors, but possibly for therapeutic use of these highly specific inhibitors. cDNA probes were kindly provided by the following investigators: ERp72 and Grp94 by Michael Green (St. Louis University); BiP by Mary-Jane Gething (Melbourne University, Australia). The cDNA probe for Hsp70 was from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-leucinal (MG132) and carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-norvaline (MG115) were kindly provided by ProScript (formerly Myogenics (Cambridge, MA)). Lactacystin was kindly provided by S. Omura (The Kitasato Institute, Tokyo, Japan). Tunicamycin was from Boehringer Mannheim. N-Acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (aLLN), E64, 1,10-phenanthroline, and leupeptin were from Sigma. Anti-BiP antibody was from Affinity Bioreagents (Neshanic Station, NJ), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunologicals (West Grove, PA). Confluent monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were incubated for up to 18 h in the absence or presence of either tunicamycin (a potent inducer of ER stress proteins) or protease inhibitors in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS). Total RNA was isolated from the cells by phenol-chloroform extraction, electrophoresed on 1% formamide/formaldehyde-agarose gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose as described previously (5Bush K.T. Hendrickson B.A. Nigam S.K. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 705-708Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Gough N.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose blots were then hybridized with random primed 32P-labeled cDNA overnight at 42°C, washed with SSC, and exposed to autoradiographic film (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To examine the degradation of short-lived proteins, MDCK cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 h in tyrosine-free DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS to which 5 μCi/ml [3H]tyrosine had been added, followed by thorough washing in Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and a chase for 2 h at 37°C in 200 μl of complete DMEM (104 μg/ml tyrosine·2Na·2H2O), 5% FCS containing the inhibitors. Chloroquine (20 μM) was added to all samples to block the lysosomal protein degradation (17Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). At the end of the chase period, trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 10%, and the medium was collected and centrifuged at maximum speed for 30 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The total acid-soluble radioactivity in clarified supernatants was determined in a scintillation counter. To measure degradation of long-lived proteins, MDCK cells were incubated for 18 h at 37°C in tyrosine-free DMEM, 5% FCS supplemented with 5 μCi/ml [3H]tyrosine, then washed in DPBS and chased for 1 h in normal DMEM, 5% FCS (104 μg/ml tyrosine·2Na·2H2O; 20 μM chloroquine was added for the final 30 min of this chase). After this chase, the medium was replaced with fresh unlabeled DMEM, 5% FCS containing inhibitors and 20 μM chloroquine and chased for an additional 2 h at 37°C. Determination of total acid-soluble radioactivity was performed at the end of this chase as described above. Since it is the aldehyde group of the peptide aldehyde inhibitors that is thought to interact with the proteasome and thus interfere with its ability to degrade proteins (34Lowe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 35Seemuller E. Lupas A. Stock D. Lowe J. Huber R. Baumeister W. Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), inactivation of this aldehyde group should ameliorate the effects of these inhibitors. Inactivation of the aldehyde group was accomplished by reduction of this group to an alcohol. DPBS with or without MG132 (final concentration 0.7 mM) was treated with 0.1 mM sodium borohydride for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was then stopped by acidification of the samples to pH 5 with glacial acetic acid to inactivate the sodium borohydride. The entire solution was then refrigerated for at least 1 h to ensure complete inactivation of the sodium borohydride. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were then incubated in DMEM, 5% FCS in the absence or presence of tunicamycin, MG132, borohydride-reduced MG132, or an equivalent volume of borohydride-treated DPBS. After 18 h of incubation, total RNA was collected, and Northern blot analysis was performed as described above. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were treated with inhibitors as described above. A time course of incorporation of 35S-labeled methionine into cellular and secreted proteins was performed. Cells were pulsed with 35S for 30 min in methionine-free DMEM, 5% FCS following either 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, or 15 h of growth in normal DMEM, 5% FCS (30 μg/ml methionine) containing protease inhibitors. The cells were then chased in nonradioactive normal DMEM, 5% FCS (30 μg/ml methionine) containing protease inhibitors for an additional 2.5 h. Cells and media were collected separately and labeled proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Acid-precipitated proteins were collected on glass microfiber filters (Whatman), washed with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, ice-cold absolute acetone, and the total acid-precipitable radioactivity (representing the total incorporation of 35S-labeled methionine into cellular or secreted proteins) was measured in a scintillation counter. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells growing on coverslips were treated with the inhibitors for 12-18 h. They were then fixed by plunging into −80°C methanol and processed for indirect immunofluorescence as described previously (27Bush K.T. Stuart R.O. Li S.-H. Moura L.A. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23694-23699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following 12-18 h of growth in the presence of protease inhibitors, the medium was collected, trichloroacetic acid was added, and the acid-precipitated material was solubilized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Equivalent amounts of the conditioned medium were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blots and probing of nitrocellulose membranes with primary antisera were performed as described previously (27Bush K.T. Stuart R.O. Li S.-H. Moura L.A. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Nigam S.K. J.

Immunoblots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescent system (Amersham Corp.) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were incubated at 37°C for 2 h in the absence or presence of the inhibitors. Following this “pretreatment,” cells were washed three times (15 min each wash) in fresh media to remove the inhibitors. After the final wash, the cells were incubated at 37°C in fresh medium for an additional 3 h. The culture media was then changed a final time, and the cells were incubated in a separate CO2 incubator maintained at 46°C for an additional 4-5 h. The cells were then rinsed in PBS and exposed for 5 min to 0.1% trypan blue in PBS (supplemented with physiological levels of Ca2+ and Mg2+), and the percentage of nonviable cells was determined. Inhibitors of proteasome function can block the degradation of most short- and long-lived proteins (17Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar), and therefore treatment with these agents is likely to cause the accumulation of such proteins not only in the cytosol, but possibly also in the ER, since a proteasome-mediated degradative pathway has been reported to function in the quality control of some ER-associated proteins (18Jensen T.J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). To test whether treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors may cause the induction of the Hsps and ER chaperones, we examined the ability of several inhibitors of the proteasome to increase the content of the mRNAs for the cytoplasmic Hsps, Hsp70 and polyubiquitin, and/or ER chaperones, BiP, ERp72, and Grp94 (2Kuznetsov G.

When cells were incubated for 12-16 h with the peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitor, MG132, the mRNA levels of both the cytosolic Hsps and the ER chaperones increased severalfold (Fig. 1). Another aldehyde proteasome inhibitor, aLLN (at concentrations greater than 10 μM), was also able to induce consistent increases in both groups of mRNAs (Fig. 2A). In the case of MG132 (10 μM), the most potent inhibitor of the proteasome, the levels of BiP and Grp94 mRNA were roughly comparable with those achieved with tunicamycin (10 μg/ml) treatment (Fig. 1), one of the most potent inducers of ER chaperones described (31Freedman R.B.

In addition, leupeptin, a potent inhibitor of certain serine proteases and many thiol proteases (e.g. the lysosomal cathepsins and calpain), which blocks most lysosomal proteolysis, but does not affect degradation of short-lived or abnormal proteins, also had no effect on these mRNA levels (Fig. 1). Thus, only those agents that inhibited the function of the proteasome (17Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L.

To confirm that these effects were due to a reduction in proteolysis, the rate of breakdown of short- and long-lived proteins was measured in control and treated cells. Although measurement of protein degradation following treatment of cells with either MG132 or aLLN showed that both MG132 and aLLN were capable of blocking the degradation of proteins, MG132 (particularly at the concentrations used to induce the chaperones (< 10 μM)), was a more potent inhibitor of the degradation of short-lived proteins (Fig. 3A). Treatment of cells with as little as 1 μM MG132 reduced the degradation of short-lived proteins up to 60-70% of control, while this level of inhibition was achieved only after treatment with 30 μM aLLN. Moreover, MG132 was found to inhibit the degradation of long-lived proteins with much greater efficacy than aLLN at all concentrations tested (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, even a concentration of 30 μM aLLN was only able to achieve roughly half the inhibition of long-lived protein degradation as 1 μM MG132 (Fig. 3B). By contrast, borohydride-reduced MG132 (see below) was much less effective blocking protein degradation (<30% inhibition of proteolysis) (Fig. 3C). Moreover, as expected, tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, which also induces BiP expression, had no effect of total proteolysis (data not shown).Fig. 2Increases in mRNAs for Hsp70 and BiP require specific inhibition of proteasome.

We cloned a mouse cDNA, which encodes a novel ∼37-kDa protein that binds to AhR; we have designated the protein as Ah receptor-interacting protein (AIP). The amino acid sequence of mouse AIP exhibits homology with members of the FK506-binding protein family. AIP also contains three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs; the TPR sequence is present in proteins required for cell cycle control and RNA synthesis and in steroid receptor-binding immunophilins. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in mouse hepatoma cells reveal that AIP is cytoplasmic and associates with unliganded Ah receptor and with hsp90; 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-<i>p</i>-dioxin treatment disrupts the AhR-AIP-hsp90 interaction.

https://openalex.org/W2005317701,"Degradation of a protein via the ubiquitin system involves two discrete steps, signaling by covalent conjugation of multiple moieties of ubiquitin and degradation of the tagged substrate. Conjugation is catalyzed via a three-step mechanism that involves three distinct enzymes that act successively: E1, E2, and E3. The first two enzymes catalyze activation of ubiquitin and transfer of the activated moiety to E3, respectively. E3, to which the substrate is specifically bound, catalyzes formation of a polyubiquitin chain that is anchored to the targeted protein. The polyubiquitin-tagged protein is degraded by the 26 S proteasome, and free and reutilizable ubiquitin is released. In addition to the three conjugating enzymes, targeting of certain proteins requires association with ancillary proteins and/or post-translational modification(s). Using a specific antibody to deplete cell extract from the molecular chaperone Hsc70, we demonstrate that this protein is required for the degradation of actin, α-crystallin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, α-lactalbumin, and histone H2A. In contrast, the degradation of bovine serum albumin, lysozyme, and oxidized RNase A is Hsc70-independent. Mechanistic analysis revealed that the chaperone is required for the conjugation reaction; however, it does not substitute for E3. Involvement of the chaperone in the proteolytic process requires complex formation with the substrate. Formation of this complex appears to be essential in the proteolytic process. In addition, the proper function of the chaperone in the proteolytic process requires the presence of K+, which allows rapid cycles of dissociation and association of the complex. The chaperone may act by binding to the substrate and unfolding it to expose a ubiquitin ligase-binding site. In addition, it can also act directly on the ubiquitination machinery."

A particularly important example of this concerns the recently described effects of anchorage on the expression and activity of components of the cell cycle machinery, including cyclin D1-CDK4,6 complexes and cyclin E-CDK2 complexes (5Fang F.

If this were so, it would have important ramifications for understanding the anchorage dependence of cell cycle traverse. Previous studies of possible collaboration between peptide mitogens and cell anchorage have led to differing results. In some cases an enhancement of mitogen signaling was observed in anchored cells as compared with their counterparts maintained in suspension, whereas in other cases no such effect was observed (19McNamee H.P. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 121: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 20Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell.

In the present investigation we have studied the collaboration between mitogens and anchorage in NIH 3T3 cells, a cell type that has been widely used in signal transduction studies. We have examined several steps in the signal transduction pathway leading from receptor tyrosine kinases to Ras and then to the downstream kinases. We find that peptide mitogen activation of receptor tyrosine kinases and subsequent activation of Ras are independent of anchorage. However, signal transduction between Ras and Raf is markedly attenuated in nonadherent cells, leading to reduced activation of Raf, MEK, and MAP kinase. NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% bovine calf serum and antibiotics. Confluent cells were serum-starved for 16 h before detachment by 0.05% trypsin and 0.33 mM EDTA; trypsin activity was neutralized by 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were suspended in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium with 2% bovine serum albumin and incubated in suspension at 37°C for 45 min in a rotator to allow kinases become quiescent. Cells were then either maintained in suspension or plated onto dishes coated with fibronectin (20 μg/ml) or with poly-L-lysine (20 μg/ml) and incubated at 37°C for the indicated times. In some cases the suspended or adherent cells were stimulated with either EGF or PDGF (Upstate Biotechnologies Inc.). Cell lysates were prepared and tested for the activity of Raf, MEK, and MAP kinase using specific in vitro kinase assays as described previously (17Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation status of the EGF receptor and PDGF receptor were evaluated by immunoprecipitation of the receptor using antibodies obtained from H. S. Earp (EGF-R) or from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (PDGF-R) followed by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (17Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For studies of GTP loading of the Ras protein, cells were radiolabeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and the [32P]GTP and GDP bound to immunoprecipitated Ras were quantitated by thin layer chromatography and PhosphorImager analysis as described (17Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Because elements of the MAP kinase cascade are directly but transiently activated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion (17Chen Q. Lin T.H. Der C.J. Juliano R.L. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 18122-18127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we initially examined the kinetics of this process to find a time point when we could examine anchorage effects on mitogen-driven activation of MAP kinase without a direct contribution from integrin-mediated MAP kinase activation. As seen in Fig. 1 (A and B), when NIH 3T3 cells were held in suspension, EGF caused a robust tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF-R but had only a very modest effect on MAP kinase (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2). After 10 min of cell adhesion to fibronectin-coated substrata, when the cells were fully attached but not spread, there was a strong adhesion-mediated activation of MAP kinase; EGF stimulation caused tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF-R and further stimulated MAP kinase (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). A qualitatively similar situation also prevailed after 30 min of cell adhesion when the cells were partially spread (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). By 180 min, when the cells were well spread, in the absence of EGF there was only a basal level of MAP kinase activity, whereas treatment with EGF caused tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF-R and resulted in a strong stimulation of MAP kinase (Fig. 1B, lanes 7 and 8). Thus, in serum-starved 3T3 cells, EGF activation of its receptor seems to be independent of cell anchorage; however, the MAP kinase response is strongly influenced by anchorage. In nonadherent cells, EGF produces only a weak activation of MAP kinase. Shortly after the cells adhere to the fibronectin substratum, EGF and anchorage have approximately additive effects on MAP kinase activity. At longer times, EGF strongly activates MAP kinase in anchored cells, whereas the direct activation by cell adhesion has returned to basal levels. In Fig. 1 (C and D) we examined EGF concentration-response relationships for EGF-R and MAP kinase in cells that have either been maintained in suspension or anchored to fibronectin for 180 min. As shown, the concentration-response profile for EGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation was essentially identical in suspended cells and cells anchored to fibronectin substrata. However, at all EGF concentrations tested, anchored cells displayed a 3–4-fold greater activation of MAP kinase than did suspended cells (for example, compare lanes 4 and 10 in Fig. 1D, both at 5 ng/ml EGF). We have also investigated how anchorage modulates mitogen actions on other components of the MAP kinase cascade. As shown in Fig. 2A, EGF stimulated similar levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF-R in suspended or anchored cells. However, EGF produced substantially stronger activations of Raf-B, MEK, and MAP kinase in cells anchored to fibronectin substrata as compared with nonanchored cells. Raf-1 was also activated (weakly) by EGF in anchored cells but not in suspended cells (not shown). We decided to also examine anchorage dependence of signaling events mediated by PDGF, another peptide mitogen. Exposure of 3T3 cells to PDGF caused a substantially greater increase in overall cellular protein tyrosine phosphorylation than was observed with EGF (not shown). As seen in Fig. 2B, PDGF caused equivalent robust tyrosine phosphorylation of its cognate receptor in both anchored and suspended cells. However, PDGF treatment resulted in markedly stronger activation of Raf-1 and MEK in anchored cells as compared with suspended cells, as well as a more modest but significant difference in MAP kinase activation. Thus, for PDGF, as for EGF, cell anchorage seems to control the efficiency of signal transduction between initial activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase and subsequent activation of downstream kinases. Because the GTP-bound form of Ras is a key transducer in the mitogen signaling pathway (18Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A. Science. 1993; 365: 781-783Google Scholar), we decided to examine Ras GTP loading in anchored or suspended 3T3 cells treated with either PDGF or EGF. As seen in Fig. 3 the basal GTP/GDP ratio was somewhat higher in suspension cells than in adherent cells. Treatment with peptide mitogen resulted in a strong increase in Ras GTP loading in both suspended cells and anchored cells, with PDGF producing a somewhat greater effect than EGF. Thus, Ras GTP loading in response to mitogens occurred in suspended cells at least as well as in anchored cells; in fact, suspended cells usually showed higher levels of GTP loading than anchored cells. This observation, along with those of Fig. 2 suggests that peptide mitogen signaling pathways are intact and operate efficiently in both suspended and anchored cells up to the level of Ras but are attenuated between Ras and the Raf kinases in the nonanchored cells. Quantitation of anchorage effects on activation of several components of the EGF- and PDGF-triggered pathways is shown in Fig. 4. The data are expressed as the ratio of the mitogen activation in suspended cells versus anchored cells. The downstream kinases (Rafs, MEKs, and MAP kinases) display substantial reductions in activity in nonanchored cells, but Ras and the receptor tyrosine kinases do not. Although the exact magnitudes of the anchorage effects on activation of the individual components of the pathway differ somewhat between EGF and PDGF, the trend is similar. The observation that EGF and PDGF produce qualitatively similar but quantitatively distinct effects on the consensus MAP kinase cascade is not surprising, because individual receptor tyrosine kinases are known to have distinct effects on cell growth and differentiation (23Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4182) Google Scholar). Although cell anchorage to a fibronectin-coated substratum clearly has a substantial impact on the MAP kinase cascade, it is not yet certain that this is purely an integrin-mediated phenomenon. Preliminary experiments have shown that EGF activation of MAP kinase is 2–3-fold greater in cells plated on a fibronectin substratum, as opposed to a poly-lysine substratum (data not shown). This suggests that the anchorage effects on signaling that we have observed may be mediated by integrins; however, several additional lines of investigation will be needed to fully confirm this possibility. Anchorage dependence of cell growth is one of the most fundamental differences between normal and transformed cells (24Ruddon R. Cancer Biology. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 101Google Scholar). Our observations indicate that cell anchorage can influence the efficiency of signal tranduction in mitogenic pathways. This suggests the possibility that adhesion effects on early signaling events may play an important role in anchorage dependence of cell growth, although other factors may also be involved. For both EGF and PDGF, the upstream events of the mitogen signaling pathway were independent of anchorage. Thus, receptor tyrosine kinase activation and GTP loading of Ras were robust in both anchored and suspended cells. For both mitogens, however, cell adhesion had a profound effect on the activation of the MEK-kinases Raf-B and Raf-1 and clear-cut effects of lesser magnitude on MEK and MAP kinase. The nonlinearity of the effects we have observed on anchorage regulation of signal transduction may be due to the extensive branching and cross-talk that is known to occur in the MAP kinase cascade (25Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 527-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Our observations suggest that in suspended cells, there is a rather sharp break in the signaling cascade between Ras and the Raf kinases. Because a major role of Ras in signal transduction is to recruit Raf to the plasma membrane (26Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that cell anchorage contributes to this process. One plausible model is that integrin-dependent focal contacts formed during cell adhesion participate in the recruitment and subsequent activation of Raf. Cell anchorage to fibronectin, a process primarily mediated by integrins, resulted in 2–3-fold greater activation of MAP kinases by peptide mitogens as compared with suspended cells. At this point it is unclear whether a change in MAP kinase activation of this magnitude would account for the strong effect that anchorage has on cell growth. It is important to note, however, that the effects of anchorage on Raf-1 or Raf-B activation were much greater (8-20-fold). Raf family kinases are thought to have downstream targets other than the MAP kinase pathway (27Avruch J. Zhang X.F. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 28Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 58-1046Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, it seems possible that the anchorage modulation of mitogen signaling reported here, particularly the dramatic effect on Raf family kinases, may be important aspects of cell growth control.

https://openalex.org/W2093878226,"A key event leading to exocytosis of pancreatic acinar cell zymogen granules is the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Studies using digital imaging microscopy and laser-scanning confocal microscopy have indicated that the initial release of Ca2+ is localized to the apical region of the acinar cell, an area of the cell dominated by secretory granules. Moreover, a recent study has shown that InsP3 is capable of releasing Ca2+ from a preparation enriched in secretory granules (Gerasimenko, O., Gerasimenko, J., Belan, P., and Petersen, O. H., (1996) Cell 84, 473-480). In the present study, we have investigated the possibility that zymogen granules express InsP3 receptors and are thus Ca2+ release sites. Immunofluorescence staining, obtained with antisera specific to types I, II, or III InsP3 receptors and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that all InsP3 receptor types were present in acinar cells. The type II receptor localized exclusively to an area close to or at the luminal plasma membrane. While types I and III InsP3 receptors displayed a similar luminal distribution, these receptors were also present at low levels in nuclei. The localization of InsP3 receptor was in marked contrast to the distribution of amylase, a zymogen granule content protein. In a zymogen granule fraction prepared in an identical manner to the aforementioned report demonstrating InsP3-induced Ca2+ release, immunoblotting demonstrated the presence of types I, II, and III InsP3 receptors. Ca2+ release from this preparation in response to InsP3, but not thapsigargin, could also be demonstrated. In contrast, when the zymogen granules were further purified on a Percoll gradient, InsP3 receptors were undetectable, and InsP3 failed to release Ca2+. Transmission electron microscopy performed on both preparations showed that the Percoll-purified granule preparation consisted of essentially pure zymogen granules, whereas the granules prepared without this step were enriched in granules but also contained significant contamination by mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclei. It is concluded that zymogen granules do not express InsP3 receptors and thus are not a site of Ca2+ release relevant to the secretory process in the pancreatic acinar cell. A key event leading to exocytosis of pancreatic acinar cell zymogen granules is the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-mediated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Studies using digital imaging microscopy and laser-scanning confocal microscopy have indicated that the initial release of Ca2+ is localized to the apical region of the acinar cell, an area of the cell dominated by secretory granules. Moreover, a recent study has shown that InsP3 is capable of releasing Ca2+ from a preparation enriched in secretory granules (Gerasimenko, O., Gerasimenko, J., Belan, P., and Petersen, O. H., (1996) Cell 84, 473-480). In the present study, we have investigated the possibility that zymogen granules express InsP3 receptors and are thus Ca2+ release sites. Immunofluorescence staining, obtained with antisera specific to types I, II, or III InsP3 receptors and analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that all InsP3 receptor types were present in acinar cells. The type II receptor localized exclusively to an area close to or at the luminal plasma membrane. While types I and III InsP3 receptors displayed a similar luminal distribution, these receptors were also present at low levels in nuclei. The localization of InsP3 receptor was in marked contrast to the distribution of amylase, a zymogen granule content protein. In a zymogen granule fraction prepared in an identical manner to the aforementioned report demonstrating InsP3-induced Ca2+ release, immunoblotting demonstrated the presence of types I, II, and III InsP3 receptors. Ca2+ release from this preparation in response to InsP3, but not thapsigargin, could also be demonstrated. In contrast, when the zymogen granules were further purified on a Percoll gradient, InsP3 receptors were undetectable, and InsP3 failed to release Ca2+. Transmission electron microscopy performed on both preparations showed that the Percoll-purified granule preparation consisted of essentially pure zymogen granules, whereas the granules prepared without this step were enriched in granules but also contained significant contamination by mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nuclei. It is concluded that zymogen granules do not express InsP3 receptors and thus are not a site of Ca2+ release relevant to the secretory process in the pancreatic acinar cell. The pancreatic acinar cell is a polarized epithelial cell whose major function is to synthesize digestive enzymes, package them into secretory granules, and then release the granule contents by regulated exocytosis (1Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Go V.W. The Pancreas. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1993: 167-189Google Scholar). A key event underlying secretagogue-stimulated digestive enzyme secretion is the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-mediated 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid release of Ca2+ from intracellular storage sites. Recently, utilizing digital imaging and confocal microscopy, it has become established that stimulation with the gut hormone cholecystokinin or the neurotransmitter acetylcholine results in a distinct spatial pattern of Ca2+ release, such that the release of Ca2+ is paradoxically initially observed at the luminal pole of the acinus and proceeds in a “wave” toward the basolateral (presumably receptor bearing) pole of the cell (2Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Google Scholar, 3Nathanson M.H. Padfield P.J. O'Sullivan A.J. Burgstahler A.O. Jamieson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18118-18121Google Scholar, 4Kasai H. Li Y. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Google Scholar). At physiological concentrations of secretagogue, it has been shown that Ca2+ release can actually be confined to this luminal region without spreading throughout the whole cell (5Thorn P. Lawire A. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Google Scholar). In addition to the overwhelming evidence for a role of InsP3 to mediate release of Ca2+, studies have also indicated that release can be initiated through a process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (3Nathanson M.H. Padfield P.J. O'Sullivan A.J. Burgstahler A.O. Jamieson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18118-18121Google Scholar, 5Thorn P. Lawire A. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Google Scholar, 8Gerasimenko O. Gerasimenko J. Belan P. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Google Scholar). The expression of ryanodine receptors has, however, not been physically demonstrated in the pancreatic acinar cell. It has been proposed that this pattern of Ca2+ release has significance for secretion since zymogen granules are confined to the luminal pole of the acinar cell and thus would provide a mechanism that increases [Ca2+]i directly at the site of its projected action. inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid Although original cell fractionation studies reported the InsP3-induced Ca2+ release site to be located in the endoplasmic reticulum (6Dormer R. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 240: G130-G140Google Scholar, 7Streb H. Bayerdorffer E. Haase W. Irvine R.F. Schulz I. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 81: 241-253Google Scholar), a recent report has suggested that zymogen granules themselves fulfill this role (8Gerasimenko O. Gerasimenko J. Belan P. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Google Scholar). This latter conclusion was primarily based on the observation that InsP3 was capable of releasing Ca2+ from a preparation enriched in granules (8Gerasimenko O. Gerasimenko J. Belan P. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Google Scholar). This proposal, however, remains controversial since the preparation was not extensively characterized, thus raising the possibility that it contained subcellular contaminants (8Gerasimenko O. Gerasimenko J. Belan P. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Google Scholar). In addition, immunolocalization of type III InsP3 receptors in pancreatic acinar cells indicates that although receptors were indeed expressed in the luminal region of the acinar cell, these receptors do not appear to co-localize with a known zymogen granule protein (secretory carrier membrane protein, SCAMP) (9Nathanson M.H. Fallon M.B. Padfield P.J. Maranto T.A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4693-4696Google Scholar). In contrast to SCAMP, the type III receptor appeared to be distributed on structures very close to the luminal membrane. These data do not, however, exclude the possibility that an InsP3 receptor other than the type III subtype is present on zymogen granules. Recently, the expression of InsP3 receptors on granules from other secretory cells has also been questioned since it appears that an earlier report of type III InsP3 receptors on secretory granules isolated from pancreatic β cells (10Blondel O. Moody M.M. Depaoli A.M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Swift H. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7777-7781Google Scholar) can now be explained by nonspecific binding of the antibody to insulin (11Ravazzola A.M. Halban P.A. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2745-2748Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the possibility that InsP3 receptors are expressed on zymogen granules using two preparations, the first prepared by simple centrifugation and identical to that used to previously demonstrate InsP3-induced release (8Gerasimenko O. Gerasimenko J. Belan P. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Google Scholar) and the second involving purification on a Percoll gradient by a protocol that has been used extensively to study integral zymogen granule proteins (12De Lisle R.C. Schultz I. Tyrakowski T. Haase W. Hopfer U. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G411-G418Google Scholar, 13Burnham D.B. Munowitz P. Thorn N. Williams J.A. Biochem.

Biol. 1992; 129: 253-266Google Scholar). In addition, using antisera specific to types I, II, and III receptors, the distribution of InsP3 receptors in acinar cells has been defined. APCT-1, −2, and −3 were raised in rabbits against peptides corresponding to the C termini of rat types I, II, and III InsP3 receptors, respectively, and affinity purified (19Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Google Scholar). This polypeptide region is highly divergent between the different InsP3 receptors, and these antibodies have been previously shown to recognize and discriminate between types I, II, and III receptors (19Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Google Scholar) from a broad range of mammalian species. In some experiments, an additional type III receptor-specific monoclonal antibody directed against amino acids 22-230 of the human type III receptor was utilized (TL-3; a gift from Transduction Laboratories). A polyclonal antibody (amy-1), directed against the zymogen granule content protein, amylase, was purchased from Sigma. Fura-2/free acid and lissamine rhodamine (sulforhodamine B) were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); bovine serum albumin (fraction V) from ICN Immunobiologicals (Lisle, IL); ECL detection system from Amersham Corp. (Arlington Heights, IL); inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and all other materials were obtained from Sigma or Bio-Rad. Pancreatic lobules were prepared and frozen in Tissue-Tek embedding medium (Miles, Elkhart, IN) with isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections (5-10 μm thick) were placed on gelatin-coated slides, air dried, and then fixed in methanol at −20°C for 10 min prior to immunofluorescence staining. Procedures for immunofluorescence localization of InsP3 receptor isoforms followed methods previously described in detail (15Ohnishi H. Ernst S.A. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538Google Scholar, 20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Oberdorf J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16652-16655Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining of amylase was performed in an identical manner to that previously published (15Ohnishi H. Ernst S.A. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538Google Scholar). Specificity of immunofluorescence was determined by preincubating primary antisera at 4°C overnight with 10 μg/ml respective peptide antigen before immunofluorescence staining (20Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. Oberdorf J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16652-16655Google Scholar). Immunolocalizations were analyzed by conventional epifluorescence and laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC 600 system. Digitized images were processed using Adobe™ Photoshop 3.0 software. Secretory granules were prepared from rat pancreas by one of two procedures, either a protocol essentially identical to Gerasimenko et al. (8Gerasimenko O. Gerasimenko J. Belan P. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Google Scholar) or by further purifying this preparation by centrifugation on a Percoll gradient (15Ohnishi H. Ernst S.A. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538Google Scholar). Briefly, pancreata were excised from male rats and rinsed in an ice-cold buffer containing 10 mM MOPS-Tris (pH 6.8), 0.1 mM MgSO4, 3 mM ATP, 250 mM sucrose, 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The pancreas was finely minced and homogenized in the same buffer using a motorized Teflon/glass homogenizer. The homogenate was initially centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. Following this spin, the supernatant was removed and further centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min. This spin resulted in a pellet consisting of a white core with a brown margin. Only the white portion of the pellet was utilized in experiments. For further purification, the white pellet was mixed with 50% Percoll containing 250 mM sucrose, 50 mM MES, 2 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 90 min, a white band toward the bottom of the tube was recovered and washed three times in the same buffer without Percoll. Ca2+ release was measured from each preparation by procedures similar to those used previously for the measurement of Ca2+ release from permeabilized cells (21Yule D.I. Wu D. Essington T.E. Shayman J.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12353-12358Google Scholar, 22Deutsch D. Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G779-G788Google Scholar). The granule pellet was resuspended at a protein concentration of 0.25-1 mg/ml in release media (135 mM KCl, 10 mM MOPS-Tris, 1 mM MgSO4, 3 mM ATP, 25 mM creatinine phosphate, 25 units/ml creatinine phosphokinase, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 100 μM Fura-2-free acid), which had been treated with Chelex-100 resin (Bio-Rad) to remove excess divalent cations. 25-μl aliquots of granules were placed in a small volume chamber mounted on the stage of an ATTOFLOR digital imaging system. Additions to the chamber were made either through a micropipette connected to a pressure ejector positioned in the chamber or directly into the chamber with a pipette. InsP3 and all test agents were reconstituted into an identical buffer but also containing 25 μM sulforhodamine (excitation 560 nm, emission 630 nm) to confirm the pressure injection and to estimate by dye dilution the amount of agent applied to the bath. Ca2+ measurements were performed as described previously (21Yule D.I. Wu D. Essington T.E. Shayman J.A. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12353-12358Google Scholar, 22Deutsch D. Williams J.A. Yule D.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G779-G788Google Scholar) with increases in Ca2+ described by an increase in 340/380 nm emission ratio. Whole cell lysates from pancreas, preparations of pancreatic acinar cells, together with the two preparations of granules were subjected to electrophoresis and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were incubated with either APCT-1, −2, −3, or TL-3 for the specific detection of types I, II, and III InsP3 receptors, respectively. Immunoreactivity was visualized using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by detection using the ECL system. In preliminary experiments, the dilution of antibody was adjusted so that equal amounts of purified types I, II, or III receptor standards produced bands of approximately equal intensity as described previously (19Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Google Scholar). Immediately after their preparation, partially purified and purified zymogen granules were fixed overnight at 4°C in a mixture of 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.13 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Subsequently, granule fractions were rinsed in cacodylate buffer, post-fixed for 1 h with 1% OsO4 in 0.13 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4), dehydrated in ethanol, and embedded in Spurr's embedding resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). Ultrathin sections (60-80 nm thick) were prepared with a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E ultramicrotome, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed and photographed with a Philips CM100 electron microscope. Digitized images were processed using Adobe™ Photoshop 3.0 software. The localization of type III receptors in the secretory “trigger zone” of acinar cells has been reported (9Nathanson M.H. Fallon M.B. Padfield P.J. Maranto T.A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4693-4696Google Scholar); however, the expression and possible localization of types I and II receptors in acinar cells are unknown. Thus the presence and subcellular distribution of each of the InsP3 receptors were determined in cryostat sections of fresh frozen pancreatic lobules (23Scheele G. Haymovits A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4918-4927Google Scholar) fixed in methanol followed by detection using an fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody and laser scanning confocal microscopy. Immunofluorescence staining was evident in acinar cells with the antibodies APCT-1, −2, and −3 or TL-3 designed to recognize types I, II, and III InsP3 receptor subtypes, respectively. These data indicate that all three InsP3 receptor subtypes are expressed in this tissue (Fig. 1, A-C, for polyclonal antibodies). Each of the receptors was localized most strikingly to regions close to or at the luminal membrane in the apical pole of the acinar cell (arrows in Fig. 1, A-C). This is a similar localization to that reported previously for the type III receptor (9Nathanson M.H. Fallon M.B. Padfield P.J. Maranto T.A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4693-4696Google Scholar). While type II receptors were exclusively distributed to the luminal region in the acinar cell, types I and III InsP3 receptors appeared to be weakly expressed in nuclei (arrowheads in Fig. 1). For comparision, sections were stained with amy-1, a polyclonal antisera directed against the secretory protein amylase, known to specifically stain zymogen granules in pancreatic acinar cells. This antisera co-localizes with other zymogen granule proteins such as Rab3D and GP-2 (15Ohnishi H. Ernst S.A. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538Google Scholar). Figs. 1D and 2C (at high power) illustrate the clear difference between anti-InsP3 receptor antibody staining associated with luminal membrane profiles and zymogen granule staining evident with the amylase antisera.Fig. 2Localization of types I and III receptors. The luminal region of pancreatic acini is shown at high magnification. A, confocal fluorescence staining with APCT-1 shows localization of the type I receptor; the receptor is distributed in a continuous fashion, consistent with a luminal plasma membrane localization. B, staining with anti-type III monoclonal antibody TL-3 shows punctate staining, suggesting localization to a population of sub-luminal vesicles. In contrast, panel C shows amy-1 staining of zymogen granules. Scale bar = 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The fluorescence associated with the luminal distribution of type I InsP3 receptor appeared subtly different from that associated with types II and III receptors. Whereas the types II and III receptor localizations in close proximity to the luminal membrane often appeared punctate (Fig. 1, B and C, and Fig. 2B for high magnification), type I receptor immunofluorescence appeared to be tightly and continuously localized to luminal membrane profiles (compare Figs. 1A, B, and C and see Fig. 2A for high magnification). For comparison, the granule localization of amylase is shown in Fig. 2C The resolution obtainable with immunofluorescence does not allow a definitive identification of cellular structures associated with fluorescence staining. The staining pattern observed for types I and III receptors may simply reflect “clustering” of receptor expression at discrete sites at the luminal membrane. Alternatively, the punctate nature of the staining, consistently observed with types II and III antibodies is suggestive of a sub-luminal vesicular distribution. In contrast, the continuous staining of type I receptor is more consistent with localization of this receptor to the luminal plasma membrane (compare Fig. 2, A and B). Staining with each polyclonal antisera was completely competed by overnight incubation of antibody at 4°C with 10 μg/ml of the respective peptide used to raise the antibody (Fig. 3A, shown for APCT-2 incubated with APCT-2 peptide; Fig. 3B shows the corresponding Nomarski image for this field). In preliminary experiments, using high concentrations of APCT-3, diffuse staining was sometimes evident in the granular region (24Yule D.I Ohnishi H Wys N. Ernst S.A. Wojcikiewicz J.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (Abstr. 3834): 659Google Scholar). This staining is in all probability nonspecific since low level staining of the granular area was also observed after competition with APCT-3 peptide. Furthermore, monoclonal antibody TL-3, directed against the type III receptor also localized to the luminal membrane area and did not, even at high concentrations, localize to zymogen granules (Fig. 2B). Although InsP3 receptors were found not to be obviously associated with secretory granules in the acinar cells, the luminal distribution of InsP3 receptor subtypes appears entirely consistent with the spatial pattern of Ca2+ signaling observed in these cells (2Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Google Scholar, 3Nathanson M.H. Padfield P.J. O'Sullivan A.J. Burgstahler A.O. Jamieson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18118-18121Google Scholar, 4Kasai H. Li Y. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Google Scholar). That the Ca2+ signal is initially observed in the secretory pole of the cell and can be confined to this region even though the production of InsP3 presumably occurs in a distal region may reflect the abundance of InsP3 receptors in this area. The apparent presence of InsP3 receptors in pancreatic acinar nuclei is also consistent with reports of Ca2+ signaling events in other non-excitable cell-types (25Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 80: 439-444Google Scholar). Since the above morphological data indicate that all InsP3 receptors are expressed in a region of the acinar cell that is intimately involved in the secretory process, the possibility that zymogen granules themselves are the site of this expression was further investigated. Immunoblots were performed on granule preparations together with lysates generated from whole pancreas and pancreatic acinar cells. Consistent with the immunofluorescence data, each of the InsP3 receptor antibodies recognized proteins of molecular weight of ∼260 kDa in whole pancreatic lysate together with an acinar cell lysate (Fig. 4). In addition, types I, II, and III InsP3 receptors could also be detected in granule fractions prepared by simple centrifugation in an identical manner to the study demonstrating release of Ca2+ from zymogen granules (8Gerasimenko O. Gerasimenko J. Belan P. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Google Scholar). The association of InsP3 receptors with zymogen granules is not consistent with either immunofluorescence data reported in this study or data reported by Nathanson et al. (9Nathanson M.H. Fallon M.B. Padfield P.J. Maranto T.A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4693-4696Google Scholar), who demonstrated that type III receptor immunofluorescence did not co-localize with a known secretory granule protein. To determine whether the InsP3 receptors detected in this granule preparation reflected the presence of receptors on zymogen granules or was due to the presence of contaminants, zymogen granule fractions were further purified by centrifugation on a Percoll gradient. This procedure generates several distinct fractions, one of which has been shown to be an essentially pure zymogen granule preparation (12De Lisle R.C. Schultz I. Tyrakowski T. Haase W. Hopfer U. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G411-G418Google Scholar, 13Burnham D.B. Munowitz P. Thorn N. Williams J.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 743-751Google Scholar). In contrast to granules prepared by simple centrifugation, InsP3 receptor immunoreactivity could not be detected in the purified granule preparation (Fig. 4). Furthermore, when the pure granules were lysed by treatment with nigericin resulting in a preparation of granule membranes, a procedure which has been shown to enrich granule membrane proteins by up to 50-fold (15Ohnishi H. Ernst S.A. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538Google Scholar, 16Wishart M.J. Andrews P.C. Nichols R. Blevins Jr., G.T. Logsdon C.D. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10303-10311Google Scholar), still no signal was observed with the InsP3-specific antibodies (data not shown). A possibility exists that InsP3 receptor antigenicity was in some way altered by purification of granules on a Percoll gradient. This appears somewhat remote based on the widespread use of Percoll to prepare functionally intact cells or subcellular fractions (26Brockbank K.J. England P. FEBS Letts. 1980; 122: 67-71Google Scholar, 27Reinhart P.H. Taylor W.M. Bygrave F.L. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 731-735Google Scholar, 28Buitrago A. Gylfe E. Henriksson C. Pertoft H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 79: 823-828Google Scholar). Indeed, this preparation of granules has been used in a variety of studies demonstrating the presence of integral zymogen granule membrane proteins by Western blotting techniques (14Wagner A.C.C. Wishart M.J. Mulders S.M. Blevins P.M. Andrews P.C. Lowe A.W. Williams J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9099-9104Google Scholar, 15Ohnishi H. Ernst S.A. Wys N. McNiven M. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538Google Scholar), the existence of kinase activity on the granules (13Burnham D.B. Munowitz P. Thorn N. Williams J.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 227: 743-751Google Scholar), and for the demonstration of a granule ionic conductance (17De Lisle R.C. Hopfer U. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: G489-G496Google Scholar, 18Threvenod F. Krishnavel V. Chathadi B.J. Hopfer U. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 129: 253-266Google Scholar). Taken together, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting data indicate that InsP3 receptors are unlikely to be present on zymogen granule membranes prepared from rat pancreatic acinar cells. The above data do not exclude the possibility that zymogen granules express a novel InsP3 receptor subtype not recognized by the battery of antisera used or that InsP3 receptors are present on granule membranes in insufficient quantity to be resolved by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. Experiments were therefore performed to determine if zymogen granules release Ca2+ in response to InsP3. Granules prepared by simple centrifugation (8Gerasimenko O. Gerasimenko J. Belan P. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Google Scholar) consistently released Ca2+ in response to InsP3 as shown by an increase of Ca2+ in the medium bathing the preparation (Fig. 5A) (12 experiments, 3 preparations). Interestingly, the release of Ca2+ in response to InsP3 was always sustained, an observation which may be related to the scarcity of InsP3 metabolizing enzymes or relatively poor Ca2+ reuptake back into the releasable pool. Addition of an equal volume of the solution used to dissolve the InsP3 never increased Ca2+, indicating that the increase was not the result of contaminating Ca2+ in this solution. Addition of 0.1 μM thapsigargin to this preparation did not result in any release of Ca2+ (Fig. 5A; 5 experiments, 3 preparations). However, addition of 0.1 μM thapsigargin to a pancreatic homogenate or a suspension of the 1000 × g pellet discarded in the initial preparation of granules resulted in an increase in Ca2+ released in the media, indicating that thapsigargin is capable of releasing Ca2+ from these subcellular organelle preparations (1000 × g pellet is shown in Fig. 5C). These data are consistent with the report by Gerasimenko et al. (8Gerasimenko O. Gerasimenko J. Belan P. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Google Scholar), who showed InsP3-induced release of Ca2+ from both a suspension of organelles and from what was reported to be a single isolated granule. In contrast, when InsP3 was added to preparations of granules that had been further purified by Percoll centrifugation, no release of Ca2+ was observed (Fig. 5B) (8 experiments, 3 preparations). Addition of ionomycin or nigericin resulted in an increase in medium Ca2+, indicating that the granules do indeed store Ca2+. Addition of thapsigargin did not release Ca2+ from this preparation (data not shown). To demonstrate that Percoll itself does not interfere with the binding of InsP3 to its receptors and the subsequent release process, the granules prepared by simple centrifugation were incubated for 90 min in the release buffer containing 50% Percoll followed by the measurement of Ca2+ release after addition of InsP3. Ca2+ release could always be elicited by InsP3 in these preparations (Fig. 5D) (4 experiments), although the Ca2+ release in Percoll-containing samples when compared with paired non-Percoll-treated controls was slower to peak, and the magnitude of the release was reduced by 41 ± 5% (Fig. 5D; compare with 5A). These data show that Percoll, even when included in the Ca2+ mobilization buffer, does not interfere with the Ca2+ release process to an extent that InsP3-induced release becomes refractory. In total, these data suggest that the source of InsP3 releasable Ca2+ in granule fractions prepared by simple centrifugation is apparently lost when the granules are further purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation. Little obvious differences between the two preparations could be seen viewing the preparations at the light-level with phase contrast microscopy. Both preparations appeared to consist of small vesicular structures less than 1 μm in diameter. Therefore, to gain insight into the differences between granules prepared by both methods, the morphology of the preparations was examined using transmission electron microscopy. As described previously, the preparation produced by purification on a Percoll gradient is dominated, almost to the exclusion of any contamination by zymogen granules (Fig. 6A, and see Refs. 11Ravazzola A.M. Halban P.A. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2745-2748Google Scholar and 12De Lisle R.C. Schultz I. Tyrakowski T. Haase W. Hopfer U. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G411-G418Google Scholar). The only non-granular organelle (estimated at less than 1% of the preparation) contamination consisted of mitochondria. In stark contrast, although the preparation produced by simple centrifugation (8Gerasimenko O. Gerasimenko J. Belan P. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Google Scholar) was enriched in zymogen granules, significant contamination was observed in each ultrathin section (Fig. 6B). In addition to zymogen granules, mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, together with nuclei were readily recognizable in each section of granules prepared in this fashion. Contamination of the granule preparation prepared by simple centrifugation with InsP3 receptor-expressing organelles apparently underlies the release of Ca2+ from this preparation. However, the nature of the contaminant is presently unclear. Since Ca2+ release from either preparation could not be initiated by treatment with thapsigargin, the zymogen granules, and the site of InsP3 releasable Ca2+ isolated with the partially purified granules do not accumulate Ca2+ via a SERCA type Ca2+-ATPase. In addition, it follows that a Ca2+ pool, which is undoubtedly present in pancreatic acinar cells that is thapsigargin releasable (29Yule D.I. Kim E. Williams J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1697-1704Google Scholar), has been removed from this preparation. In conclusion, immunocytochemical data regarding InsP3 receptor distribution presented in this report is consistent with the view that the site of the physiologically important InsP3-releasable Ca2+ pool is localized within the secretory “trigger zone” of the pancreatic acinar cell. This putative Ca2+ release/storage site appears not to be associated with zymogen granules but in all probability is situated in close association with the apical membrane.

Part of NO-related cytotoxicity is mediated by peroxynitrite, an oxidant species produced from NO and superoxide. Aminoguanidine and mercaptoethylguanidine (MEG) are inhibitors of iNOS and have anti-inflammatory properties. Here we demonstrate that MEG and related compounds are scavengers of peroxynitrite. MEG caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the peroxynitrite-induced oxidation of cytochrome c2+, hydroxylation of benzoate, and nitration of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid. MEG reacts with peroxynitrite with a second-order rate constant of 1900 ± 64 M−1 s−1 at 37°C. In cultured macrophages, MEG reduced the suppression of mitochondrial respiration and DNA single strand breakage in response to peroxynitrite. MEG also reduced the degree of vascular hyporeactivity in rat thoracic aortic rings exposed to peroxynitrite. The free thiol plays an important role in the scavenging effect of MEG. Aminoguanidine neither affected the oxidation of cytochrome c2+ nor reacted with ground state peroxynitrite, but inhibited the peroxynitrite-induced benzoate hydroxylation and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid nitration, indicating that it reacts with activated peroxynitrous acid or nitrogen dioxide.

Considering the physiological functions of these NOS isoforms, inhibition of the activity of the constitutive isoforms of NOS (endothelial and brain), while preventing the formation of peroxynitrite, may also result in undesirable effects, such as vasospasm, enhanced platelet and neutrophil adhesion to the vascular endothelium, or alterations in central nervous system functions. Consequently, when peroxynitrite is formed from constitutive NOS-derived NO, scavenging of peroxynitrite would be preferred to inhibition of NO synthesis. On the other hand, selective inhibition of iNOS, by preventing excessive NO and peroxynitrite formation, has been shown to provide distinct therapeutic benefits in a number of inflammatory conditions. Selective iNOS inhibitors, such as aminoguanidine, S-methylisothiourea, aminoethylisothiourea (AETU), and L-N6-(1-iminoethyl)lysine, have been shown to have marked protective effects in a variety of local and systemic inflammatory disorders (42Cross A.H.

We have recently reported the spontaneous rearrangement of aminoalkylisothiourea NOS inhibitors in aqueous solutions to form mercaptoalkylguanidines (53Southan G.J. Szabó C. Thiemermann C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 510-516Google Scholar). Some of the mercaptoalkylguanidines are potent inhibitors of NOS, with selectivity toward the inducible isoform (53Southan G.J. Szabó C. Thiemermann C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 510-516Google Scholar). For example, AETU may rearrange to MEG (and a small percentage to the cyclic NOS inhibitor aminothiazoline). Oxidation of MEG yields guanidinoethyl disulfide (GED), which is a potent iNOS-selective inhibitor in its own right (46Southan G.J. Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Salzman A.L. Szabó C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 619-632Google Scholar, 47Szabó C. Bryk R. Zingarelli B. Southan G.J. Gahman T.C. Bhat V. Salzman A.L. Wolff D.J. Br J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1659-1668Google Scholar). In this paper, we describe our findings demonstrating that MEG and related compounds are potent scavengers of peroxynitrite. Based on these data, we propose that the combined mode of action (selective inhibition of iNOS and scavenging peroxynitrite) is responsible for the marked protective effects of MEG and other guanidines in pathophysiological conditions associated with iNOS expression and peroxynitrite formation. The peroxynitrite-dependent oxidation of cytochrome c2+ was measured as described (54Thomson L. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 491-497Google Scholar, 55Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 49-58Google Scholar). Cytochrome c was reduced by sodium dithionite immediately before use and purified by chromatography on Sephadex G-25 using 100 mM potassium phosphate containing 0.1 mM DTPA, pH 7.2, as the elution buffer. The concentration of cytochrome c2+ was determined spectrophotometrically at 550 nm in the same buffer (ϵ550 = 21 mM−1 cm−1). Cytochrome c2+ oxidation (50 μM) yields upon addition of peroxynitrite (25 μM initial concentration after mixing) were assessed by incubation of reaction mixtures in 100 mM potassium phosphate containing 0.1 mM DTPA, pH 7.2, at 22°C for 3 min in the absence or presence of MEG or related compounds (1 μM to 3 mM). Oxidation of cytochrome c2+ was followed at 550 nm using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. In control, reverse-order experiments, we confirmed that the various compounds used in this study did not interfere with the spectrophotometric measurements at the above wavelength. Moreover, in control experiments, we confirmed that the compounds tested do not reduce cytochrome c3+. The peroxynitrite-dependent hydroxylation of benzoate was measured as described (55Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 49-58Google Scholar, 56Baker M.S. Gebicki J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 258-264Google Scholar). Briefly, peroxynitrite (100 μM initial concentration after mixing) was added to a buffer containing 1 mM sodium benzoate in 100 mM potassium phosphate containing 0.1 mM DTPA, pH 7.2, at 25°C in the absence or presence of MEG or related compounds (1 μM to 3 mM). After a 3-min incubation at 22°C, fluorescence was measured using a Perkin-Elmer fluorometer (Model LS50B) at an excitation wavelength of 300 nm and emission wavelength of 410 nm (slit widths of 2.5 and 3.0 nm, respectively). In control, reverse-order experiments, we confirmed that the various compounds used in this study did not interfere with the assay at the above wavelengths. Nitration of 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (4-HPA) in the presence of MEG or aminoguanidine was carried out at pH 7.55 and 37°C in 50 mM phosphate. In a typical experiment, a solution containing 2 mM 4-HPA, 100 μM DTPA, 50 mM phosphate buffer, and 0-20 mM MEG or aminoguanidine was rapidly mixed with peroxynitrite (0.6 mM initial concentration after mixing) by vortexing. After 5 min, pH was measured and then adjusted to 10-11 by adding 1 M NaOH. The absorbance at 430 nm was then read. The concentration of the 3-NO2-4-HPA formed was calculated using ϵ430 = 4400 M−1 cm−1 (57Beckman J.S. Ischiropoulos H. Zhu L. van der Woerd M. Smith C. Chen J. Harrison J. Martin J.C. Tsai M. Arch.

Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Google Scholar). The kinetics of peroxynitrite decomposition was fitted to a first-order equation by nonlinear regression. A typical run consisted of 400 points collected over more than nine half-lives so at least 99.9% of the peroxynitrite disappeared. The final pH was measured at the outlet. J774 macrophages were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 3.5 mmol/liter L-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum as described (25Szabó C. Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1753-1758Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 96-well plates (200 μl of medium/well) or in 12-well plates (3 ml of medium/well) until confluence. Cells were pretreated with various concentrations of MEG (1-300 μM) for 10 min, followed by the addition of peroxynitrite (1 mM), and mitochondrial respiration and DNA strand breakage were measured at 1 h. In control, reverse-order experiments, MEG was added 10 min after the addition of peroxynitrite. In another set of experiments, cells were exposed to the NO compound S-nitroso-N-acetyl-DL-penicillamine (SNAP, 3 mM) for 24 h in the absence or presence of various concentrations of MEG (10-300 μM), and respiration was measured at 24 h. Cell respiration was assessed by the mitochondrion-dependent reduction of MTT to formazan (25Szabó C. Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1753-1758Google Scholar). Cells in 96-well plates were incubated at 37°C with MTT (0.2 mg/ml) for 1 h. Culture medium was removed by aspiration, and the cells were solubilized in Me2SO (100 μl). The extent of reduction of MTT to formazan within cells was quantitated by measurement of the absorbance at 550 nm. The formation of strand breaks in double-stranded DNA was determined by the alkaline unwinding method as described previously (25Szabó C. Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1753-1758Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, in which ethidium bromide binds preferentially to double-stranded DNA, the percentage of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) may be determined using the following equation: % dsDNA = 100 × ((F(P) − F(B))/(F(T) − F(B))), where F(P) is the fluorescence of the sample, F(B) is the background fluorescence (i.e. fluorescence due to all cell components other than double-stranded DNA), and F(T) is the maximum fluorescence. Thoracic aortas from rats were cleared of adhering periadventitial fat and cut into rings of 3-4-mm width. Rings were placed in Krebs solution and exposed to peroxynitrite (1 mM) or a vehicle control in the presence or absence of 300 μM MEG. Following a 30-min incubation, rings were analyzed for isometric contractility. The rings were mounted in organ baths (5 ml) filled with warmed (37°C), oxygenated (95% O2 and 5% CO2) Krebs solution, pH 7.4, consisting of 118 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 25 mM NaHCO3, and 11.7 mM glucose in the presence of 10 μM indomethacin. Isometric force was measured with isometric transducers (Kent Scientific Corp., Litchfield, CT), digitized using a Maclab A/D converter (AD Instruments, Milford, MA, and stored and displayed on a Macintosh personal computer. A tension of 1 g was applied, and the rings were equilibrated for 60 min, changing the Krebs solution every 15 min (27Szabó C. Zingarelli B. Salzman A.L. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 1051-1063Google Scholar). Concentration-response curves to norepinephrine (10−9 to 10−5M) were then obtained. In another set of experiments, the effect of MEG on the relaxant effect of the NO donor SNAP was studied. In these experiments, rings were taken from the animals, mounted for the measurement of isometric tension, treated with MEG (1 mM) or vehicle for 10 min, precontracted with norepinephrine (10−6M), and then treated with increasing concentrations of SNAP. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. SNAP was purchased from Calbiochem. AETU and related aminoalkylisothioureas were prepared as described previously (46Southan G.J. Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Salzman A.L. Szabó C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 619-632Google Scholar). MEG and mercaptopropylguanidine were prepared from AETU and APTU, respectively, as described previously (46Southan G.J. Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Salzman A.L. Szabó C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 619-632Google Scholar). Peroxynitrite was synthesized as described previously (1Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Google Scholar, 15Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4244-4250Google Scholar, 16Radi R. Beckman J.S. Bush K.M. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem.

All values in the figures and below are expressed as means ± S.E. or as standard error of the mean of n observations.

Student's unpaired t test was used to compare means between groups, using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. As previously reported (54Thomson L. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 491-497Google Scholar, 55Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem.

Harrison J. Martin J.C. Tsai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 438-445Google Scholar), peroxynitrite induced a significant oxidation of cytochrome c2+ and hydroxylation of benzoate. These two targets for peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation react with different reactive intermediates, such as ground state peroxynitrite (cytochrome c2+ (54Thomson L. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 491-497Google Scholar)) and activated peroxynitrous acid (benzoate (55Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 49-58Google Scholar)). Although the reactive intermediates were different, both oxidant processes studied were still dose-dependently inhibited by MEG. The EC50 values differed in the two assays mostly due to the different reaction chemistries involved (see “Discussion”). Thus, comparisons of potency of the different tested compounds in absolute terms should be performed only for each assay (vertical comparison in Table I), whereas comparisons within assays (horizontal comparison in Table I) should be used only to give an idea of the preferred reaction mechanisms. In this study, we employed both assays to draw conclusions regarding the nature of the different scavenging mechanisms of MEG and related guanidines during peroxynitrite-induced oxidant processes.TABLE I.Inhibition by mercaptoalkylguanidines and reference compounds of the peroxynitrite-induced oxidation of cytochrome c2+ and hydroxylation of benzoateCompoundEC50Cytochrome c2+BenzoateμMMEG50500SEGaSEG, selenoethylguanidine; MPG, mercaptopropylguanidine.70200N-Methyl-MEG200400N,N′-Dimethyl-MEG300700S-Methyl-MEG50001300GED30,0005000MPG200500N,N′-Dimethyl-MPG300900S-(Dimethylaminopropyl)-AETU10,0008000Aminoguanidine>30,00010,000Glutathione300600Cysteine160200Penicillamine601000a SEG, selenoethylguanidine; MPG, mercaptopropylguanidine. Open table in a new tab MEG inhibited the oxidant processes in both assays with high potency (Fig. 1 and Table I). S-Methyl-MEG and the disulfide dimer of MEG, GED, also inhibited the oxidation of cytochrome c2+ and the hydroxylation of benzoate, but their potency was much weaker when compared with that of MEG (Fig. 1 and Table I). In particular, it is important to note that MEG was ∼1000 times more potent than S-methyl-MEG or GED as an inhibitor of peroxynitrite-induced oxidation of cytochrome c2+. L-Arginine-based NOS inhibitors, such as NG-methyl-L-arginine, did not inhibit the oxidative processes (data not shown). We have compared the potencies of MEG and a number of related mercaptoalkylguanidines with the potencies of other compounds containing a free thiol (Table I). We have observed that, in both assays, the potencies of the free thiol-containing compounds were approximately 2 orders of magnitude greater than those that cannot undergo a rearrangement to yield free thiols (46Southan G.J. Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Salzman A.L. Szabó C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 619-632Google Scholar), such as S-(dimethylaminopropyl)-AETU (Table I) and S-(dimethylaminoethyl)-AETU (data not shown). Similarly, alkylation of the sulfur (S-methyl-MEG) or its oxidation to disulfide (GED) reduced the effectiveness of the compounds as scavengers of peroxynitrite. These reductions were more pronounced in the cytochrome c2+ assay and less pronounced in the benzoate hydroxylation assay (Fig. 1 and Table I), in agreement with the different oxidation mechanisms involved (54Thomson L. Trujillo M. Telleri R. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 491-497Google Scholar, 55Denicola A. Freeman B.A. Trujillo M. Radi R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 49-58Google Scholar). Thus, the free thiol appears to be crucial to the inhibitory effect of mercaptoalkylguanidines on the peroxynitrite-induced oxidation of cytochrome c2+. MEG, as a scavenger of peroxynitrite, had comparable potency to other thiol-containing scavengers, namely glutathione, cysteine, and penicillamine (Table I) and also cysteamine, cysteine ethyl ester, and cysteine methyl ester (data not shown). Replacement of the sulfur with selenium yielded comparable inhibitory potency to MEG in all assays used, in line with the concept that seleno compounds can also scavenge peroxynitrite (58Matsumoto H. Sies H. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 262-267Google Scholar, 59Briviba K. Roussyn I. Sharov V.S. Sies H. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 13-15Google Scholar). In most instances, N-methylation of MEG or mercaptopropylguanidine tended to reduce the potency when compared with the parent compound (Table I). Aminoguanidine caused a modest, dose-dependent reduction of the peroxynitrite-induced hydroxylation of benzoate. However, aminoguanidine exhibited negligible potency against the peroxynitrite-induced oxidation of cytochrome c2+ (Fig. 1 and Table I). MEG and aminoguanidine (less potently) caused a dose-de"

In a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe where the equation of state for the cosmological fluid is uncertain, the energy conditions provide simple, model-independent, and robust bounds on the behavior of the density and look-back time as a function of red shift.

We reported that Cu,Zn-SOD can catalyze free radical generation and a FALS mutant, G93A, exhibits an enhanced free radical-generating activity, while its dismutation activity is identical to that of the wild-type enzyme (Yim, M. B., Kang, J.-H., Yim, H.-S., Kwak, H.-S., Chock, P. B., and Stadtman, E. R. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 5709–5714). The A4V mutation is both the most commonly detected of FALS-associated SOD1 mutations and among the most clinically severe (Rosen, D. R., Bowling, A. C., Patterson, D., Usdin, T. B., Sapp, P., Mezey, E., McKenna-Yasek, D., O'Regan, J. P., Rahmani, Z., Ferrante, R. J., Brownstein, M. J., Kowall, N. W., Beal, M. F., Horvitz, H. R., and Brown, R. H., Jr. (1994) Hum. Mol. Genet. 3, 981–987). We cloned the cDNA for the FALS A4V mutant, overexpressed the protein in Sf9 insect cells, purified the protein, and studied its enzymic activities. Our results show that the mutant and wild-type enzymes contain one copper ion per subunit and have identical dismutation activities. However, the free radical-generating activity of the mutant, as measured by the spin trapping method at low H2O2 concentration, is enhanced relative to that of the wild-type and G93A enzyme (wild-type < G93A < A4V). This is due to the decrease in the Km value for H2O2, wild-type > G93A > A4V, while the kcat is identical for these enzymes. Thus, the FALS symptoms are not associated with the reduction in the dismutation activity of the mutant enzyme. The fact that the A4V mutant has the lowest Km for H2O2 is correlated to the clinical severity observed with the A4V patients, if FALS is associated with a differential gain of the free radical-generating function of the Cu,Zn-SOD mutant.

We therefore investigated to find out whether a correlation exists between severity of the disease and enhancement of the free radical generating function of Cu,Zn-SOD mutants. Our results showed that under low H2O2 concentration, the A4V mutant has a higher free radical-generating activity than those of the G93A and the wild-type enzyme (A4V > G93A > wild-type), due to the decrease in the value of Km for H2O2 (A4V < G93A < wild-type).

Kang J.-H. Yim H.-S. Kwak H.-S. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The identities and purities of the recombinant human Cu,Zn-SOD, both the wild-type enzyme and its mutant A4V, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, activity staining, and assay of enzymic activity. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the extinction coefficient ϵ258 = 1.03 × 104M−1 cm−1 (4McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dismutation activity was measured by monitoring the capacity of the enzyme to inhibit the reduction of ferricytochrome c by xanthine/xanthine oxidase as described by McCord and Fridovich (4McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The identities of purified wild-type and A4V proteins were verified by electrospray mass spectroscopy, and the content of copper ions in these proteins was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer, model 4100ZL). A spin trap, DMPO, was used to convert transient free radicals (R·) to stable free radical adducts according to the Reaction R1. DMPO + R•→DMPO—R• The nature of the trapped free radical can be identified by hyperfine coupling constants of the spin adduct measured by EPR spectroscopy. The EPR spectrometer and the procedure for sample transfer were described previously (5Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5006-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 6Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4099-4105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectral acquisitions began 30 s after initiation of the reaction by the injection of H2O2. The conditions for the acquisition of spectral data were as follows: temperature, 25°C; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 1 G; conversion time, 10.24 ms; time constant, 82 ms; sweep time, 21 s; sweep width, 70 G with 2048-point resolution. The 3-carbamoylproxyl spin label was used as a standard to estimate the concentration of the DMPO-free radical adducts. All buffers used were pretreated with Chelex 100 resin. The expression system, which uses Sf9 insect cells infected with the recombinant baculoviruses, was described previously (17Yim M.B. Kang J.-H. Yim H.-S. Kwak H.-S. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The recombinant enzymes were purified using a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography and were dialyzed against phosphate buffer (2.5 mM, pH 7.8) in the presence of Chelex 100 (17Yim M.B. Kang J.-H. Yim H.-S. Kwak H.-S. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE and immunoblot of the purified recombinant enzyme shown in Fig. 1 do not exhibit any other protein band. The masses of the subunits measured using electrospray mass spectroscopy were determined to be 15,845.2 Da for the wild-type, 15,859.6 Da for G93A, and 15,874.0 Da for A4V proteins. These results indicate that the recombinant proteins contain acetylated N-terminals, and the glycine and the alanine are substituted by the alanine and the valine in the G93A and A4V mutants, respectively. The concentration of the copper ions in these proteins determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy is almost identical, showing that 1 mol of each subunit contains 0.95 ± 0.05 mol of copper ions. Superoxide dismutation activities of the recombinant Cu,Zn-SOD were measured by monitoring their ability to inhibit the reduction of cytochrome c by xanthine/xanthine oxidase (4McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activities of the recombinant G93A and A4V Cu,Zn-SOD so determined are 95 ± 4% of that exhibited by the wild-type enzyme. We have described previously (5Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5006-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 6Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4099-4105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that Cu,Zn-SOD has a free radical-generating function, which catalyzes the formation of ·OH radicals with H2O2 as substrate and the formation of scavenger-derived radicals with anionic radical scavengers and H2O2 as substrates. Results obtained from spin trapping experiments with the recombinant enzymes are shown in Fig. 2. Spectrum A originates from the ·OH radical adduct of DMPO (DMPO-OH) generated in a solution containing 100 mM DMPO, 5 mM H2O2, and 0.8 μM recombinant wild-type Cu,Zn-SOD in 23.5 mM NaHCO3/CO2 buffer at pH 7.6. The heat-inactivated Cu,Zn-SOD fails to catalyze the formation of free radical adducts (spectrum D), indicating that active enzyme is required. When the experiments were repeated under the identical conditions using the recombinant mutant enzymes, the EPR signal of the DMPO-OH adduct was enhanced and showed the relative amplitude in the following order: wild-type < G93A (spectrum B) < A4V (spectrum C). The results obtained with varying concentration of H2O2 consistently show that the A4V mutant is a better catalyst for ·OH radical production than the G93A and the wild-type enzyme. To examine the cause of this enhancement, we measured the initial rates of the DMPO-OH adduct formation as a function of H2O2 concentrations. The double-reciprocal plot of these results is shown in Fig. 3. It shows that the wild-type, G93A, and A4V enzymes have an identical Vmax value (3.1 μM/min, kcat = 4.0/min) for the formation of the adducts at pH 7.6. However, the Km for H2O2 is consistently lower with the A4V mutant relative to those with the G93A and the wild-type enzyme. The Km so determined are 44, 25, and 13 mM for the wild-type, G93A, and A4V, respectively. The Km values of the wild-type and the G93A and their kcat values are very similar to the values reported previously (17Yim M.B. Kang J.-H. Yim H.-S. Kwak H.-S. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The results obtained in this study with the purified recombinant human wild-type Cu,Zn-SOD and its FALS mutants, A4V and G93A, revealed that these enzymes contain one copper ion per subunit, and they exhibit similar superoxide dismutation activities. However, the free radical-generating activity of the A4V and the G93A mutants, as measured by spin trapping and EPR methods, is consistently enhanced in comparison with that of the wild-type enzyme (A4V > G93A > wild-type) (Fig. 2). This enhancement is caused by the lower Km values for H2O2 found with the A4V and the G93A mutants relative to that of the wild-type enzyme (A4V (13 mM) < G93A (25 mM) < wild-type (44 mM)) (Fig. 3). The lowest Km value found with the A4V mutant is less than one-third of the value obtained with the wild-type enzyme. The enhanced free radical-generating activity of the FALS mutants may, in part, be responsible for the cause of FALS. The high capacity of the mutant enzymes to catalyze the generation of ·OH radicals will lead to following consequences: (i) the higher concentration of ·OH radicals generated by the mutants accelerates their direct damaging reactions against the biological environments, which include the Cu,Zn-SOD mutants themselves. The damaging reaction will accelerate the inactivation of the mutant Cu,Zn-SOD and causes the release of its metal ions. The released copper ions, when bound to proper ligand molecules or proteins, will also enhance Fenton-type site-specific damaging reactions. The mutant Cu,Zn-SOD and perhaps the metal-free inactive SOD may also participate in other damaging reactions, such as enhancement of peroxynitrite-mediated tyrosine nitration, and lead to permanent impairment of the signal transduction pathway by blocking phosphorylation (19Kong S.-I.

Beckman J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). (ii) The lower Km for H2O2 of the mutants will enhance the production of anionic scavenger-derived radicals from the scavengers such as neurotransmitters, glutamate and taurine (6Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4099-4105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cellularly abundant glutathione (22Kwak H.-S. Yim H.-S. Chock P.B. Yim M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4582-4586Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These radicals may exert more specific deleterious effects in motor neurons (17Yim M.B. Kang J.-H. Yim H.-S. Kwak H.-S. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In view of the fact that the intracellular concentration of the H2O2 is in the low or submillimolar range, the differential Km values observed with the mutant enzymes should play a dominant role in the severity of the various FALS. In this regard, one expects the much reduced Km value of the A4V mutant obtained in this study to correlate with the severity of A4V FALS patients. Rosen et al. (10Rosen D.R. Bowling A.C.

Genet. 1994; 3: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) have shown in their clinical study that the A4V mutation is both the most commonly detected and the most clinically aggressive form associated with FALS patients. They found that about 40% of FALS families subjected for their study have the A4V mutation, and these patients survive only an average of 1.2 years after the onset of the disease, as compared with 2.5 years for the average survival of all other FALS patients. Therefore, our results together with those reported by Rosen et al. (10Rosen D.R. Bowling A.C. Patterson D. Usdin T.B. Sapp P. Mezey E. McKenna-Yasek D. O'Regan J.P. Rahmani Z. Ferrante R.J.

In vitro studies using this SH2 domain revealed that it was capable of binding directly to the Tyr(P)317 motif of Shc with a KD of approximately 290 nM, in keeping with other specific SH2/Tyr(P) interactions. In vivo analysis revealed the SH2 and NPXpY motifs of SHIP acted together, with the Tyr(P)317 and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domains of Shc, respectively, to ensure a high affinity SHIP·Shc complex. Expression of cDNAs encoding hemagglutinin-tagged wild type and SH2-inactivated forms of SHIP in the murine hemopoietic cell line DA-ER revealed that wild type SHIP becomes both tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with Shc following interleukin-3 stimulation, as expected, but the SH2-inactivated SHIPs do neither. Moreover, while the growth rates of parental DA-ER cells and cells expressing these various SHIP constructs are identical, the wild type SHIP-expressing cells die, via programmed cell death, far more rapidly than parental cells. Cells expressing SH2-inactivated SHIPs, on the other hand, show either a reduced or no effect on apoptosis.

In exploratory experiments, oligosaccharides were released by hydrazinolysis to obtain N-glycosidically linked chains, and by reductive and non-reductive alkaline hydrolysis to obtain O-glycosidically linked chains; these were examined for immunoreactivities after conversion to neoglycolipids. Having observed immunoreactive oligosaccharides among all three oligosaccharide populations, a more detailed investigation has been performed of oligosaccharides released by reductive alkaline hydrolysis. Glycopeptides were prepared from a Pronase digest of a lipid-free protein residue (chloroform-methanol extract) of rabbit brain, after precipitation of glycosaminoglycans with cetylpyridium chloride (27Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4389-4396Google Scholar). In small scale experiments, oligosaccharides were obtained from 10-mg aliquots of brain glycopeptides by three methods. (i) O-Glycosidic oligosaccharides in reducing form were obtained after subjecting the glycopeptides to hydrolysis with ethylamine (70% w/v in water) at 60° C for 6 h as described (28Yuen C.-T. Lawson A.M. Chai W. Larkin M. Stoll M.S. Stuart A.C. Sullivan F.X. Ahern T.J. Feizi T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9126-9131Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide-rich fraction was N-acetylated using acetic anhydride (29Takasaki S. Mizuochi T. Kobata A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 263-268Google Scholar) to acetylate free amino groups of any residual peptide materials that might interfere with the reductive amination reaction in the generation of neoglycolipids. (ii) O-Glycosidic oligosaccharides in reduced form were obtained after subjecting the glycopeptides to hydrolysis with 0.05 M NaOH, 1 M NaBH4 at 45°C for 16 h as described (30Iyer R.N. Carlson D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 101-105Google Scholar), and the oligosaccharide-rich fraction was N-acetylated (29Takasaki S. Mizuochi T. Kobata A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 263-268Google Scholar). (iii) N-Glycosidic oligosaccharides in reducing form were obtained after treatment of the glycopeptides with anhydrous hydrazine for 9 h (29Takasaki S. Mizuochi T. Kobata A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 263-268Google Scholar). In a larger scale experiment, O-glycosidic oligosaccharides in reduced state were obtained from 600-mg glycopeptides after reductive alkaline hydrolysis (30Iyer R.N. Carlson D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 142: 101-105Google Scholar). Sulfated tri-, tetra-, and pentasaccharides of the Lea series were synthesized chemically: HSO3-3Galβ1-3(Fucα1-4)GlcNAc and HSO3-3Galβ1-3(Fucα1-4)GlcNAcβ1-3Gal (31Nicolaou K.C. Bockovich N.J. Carcanague D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 8843-8844Google Scholar) were gifts of Dr. K. C. Nicolaou (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) and HSO3-3Galβ1-3 (Fucα1-4)GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4Glc (32Lubineau A. Le Gallic J. Lemoine R. Bioorgan. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1994; 2: 1143-1151Google Scholar) was a gift of Dr. A. Lubineau (University Paris, Orsay, France). Manα1-2Man and Fucα1-2Gal were from BioCarb through Russell Fine Chemicals (Chester, United Kingdom) and Glcα1-2Glc was from Dextra Laboratories (Reading, United Kingdom). These disaccharides were reduced with NaBH4 (29Takasaki S. Mizuochi T. Kobata A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 263-268Google Scholar). Oligosaccharides obtained in each of the small scale experiments were fractionated on DEAE Sephadex A-25 (0.75 ml, acetate form, Pharmacia) into neutral fractions, 1.5 ml (unretained with 10 mM NH4OAc, pH 5) and acidic fractions, 3 ml (eluted with 500 mM NH4OAc, pH 5); these were designated as N and A, respectively. Fractions A were treated with Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase (Boehringer Mannheim) and further fractionated as above into neutral (Ns) and sialidase-resistant acidic fractions: As1, and As2 eluted with 100 and 500 mM NH4OAc, respectively. Oligosaccharides recovered are summarized in Table I. An aliquot of oligosaccharides As2 (26 μg of hexose) from the ethylamine hydrolysis experiment was further fractionated by isocratic elution on a normal phase HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyDHPEL-1,2-dihexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamineDPPEL-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamineLSIMSliquid secondary ion mass spectrometry column (TSK amide-80, 4.6 × 250 mm, Anachem, United Kingdom) using 70% acetonitrile/water in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.3, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Eight fractions (1.5 ml each), designated As2 a-h, were collected after 2 min of flow, and desalted using AG 50W X-12 H+ (Bio-Rad); whole fractions were converted to neoglycolipids, and 10% aliquots of the neoglycolipid reaction mixtures tested for HNK-1 immunoreactivity.TABLE I.Oligosaccharides recovered in the small scale experimentsMethodOligosaccharidesTotalNANsAs1As2μg hexoseEthylamine73318853434111951aTwenty-six μg of oligosaccharide fraction As2 (determined as hexose) from the ethylamine experiment was subfractionated into eight fractions (a-h) by normal phase HPLC as described under “Materials and Methods”; fraction g with the strongest HNK-1 immunoreactivity as neoglycolipids was subjected to TLC-LSIMS.Alkaline borohydride122022783660912947Hydrazine1774382126788717263a Twenty-six μg of oligosaccharide fraction As2 (determined as hexose) from the ethylamine experiment was subfractionated into eight fractions (a-h) by normal phase HPLC as described under “Materials and Methods”; fraction g with the strongest HNK-1 immunoreactivity as neoglycolipids was subjected to TLC-LSIMS.

Mizuochi T. Kobata A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 83: 105-126Google Scholar) except that 2 mM trifluoroacetic acid was used as eluent at ambient temperature. Bio-Gel P-6 was used to separate high molecular weight materials located at the void volume from the smaller sized retained fractions, eluting between 61 and 150 ml. The retained fraction, 80.3 mg of hexose, was concentrated by evaporation and fractionated on Bio-Gel P-4. Seven pooled fractions were obtained (Fig. 1): 1) 0.5 mg; 2) 3.1 mg; 3) 5.5 mg; 4) 3.6 mg; 5) 13.4 mg; 6) 52.0 mg; and 7) 1.7 mg, determined as hexose. Aliquots of these pooled fractions (5 μg of hexose) were converted to neoglycolipids and tested for HNK-1 immunoreactivity (Fig. 2). The pooled Bio-Gel P-4 fractions 1, 2, and 3 which showed strong HNK-1 immunoreactivities were chromatographed on a weak anion exchange polymeric HPLC column (Asahipak NH2-P50, 4.6 × 250 mm, Prolabo, United Kingdom) using a start solvent: 2.5 mM NH4OAc, pH 6.8, and eluting with 0–250 mM NH4OH, pH 11.7 (Fig. 3). A neutral fraction eluting with the start solvent and two acidic fractions eluting at about 80 and 150 mM NH4OH were obtained, and designated N, A1, and A2, respectively (for example 1N, 1A1, and 1A2 for the three subfractions of Bio-Gel P-4 pool 1). Aliquots of these fractions (5 μg of hexose) were converted to neoglycolipids and tested for HNK-1 immunoreactivities as neoglycolipids (results not shown). In each set, fraction A2 showed HNK-1 immunoreactivity and was further fractionated by gradient elution on a normal phase TSK amide-80 HPLC column as above using acetonitrile/water in 2 mM trifluoroacetic acid (Fig. 4). Aliquots of these chromatographic fractions (1 μg of hexose) were monitored for HNK-1 immunoreactivities as neoglycolipids. From each of the A2 oligosaccharide fractions, three HNK-1 immunoreactive subfractions were obtained (Fig. 4): 1Ab, 1Ac, and 1Ad; 2Ac, 2Ad, and 2Ae; and 3Ad, 3Ae, and 3Af; the oligosaccharides recovered in terms of micrograms of hexose are given in Table II.Fig. 2Antibody binding assay to reveal HNK-1 immunoreactivity among neoglycolipids prepared from the pooled oligosaccharide alditol fractions 1 to 7 obtained in the large scale experiment.

Stoll M.S. Yuen C.-T. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 484-519Google Scholar). Neoglycolipids of reducing oligosaccharides and the reduced oligosaccharides were prepared as described previously, incorporating a mild periodate oxidation step with the reduced oligosaccharides (34Feizi T. Stoll M.S. Yuen C.-T. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 484-519Google Scholar), and using L-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DPPE) from Sigma in the small scale experiments. L-1,2-Dihexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DHPE) from Fluka was used in the large scale experiments to avoid the traces of monoacyl products that are formed when DPPE is used (34Feizi T. Stoll M.S. Yuen C.-T. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 484-519Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were resolved on HPTLC Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck, BDH) using chloroform/methanol/aqueous, 0.2% CaCl2 (v/v): 60/30/6 (solvent A) or 55/45/10 (solvent B) as indicated, and subjected to primulin staining (34Feizi T. Stoll M.S. Yuen C.-T. Chai W. Lawson A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 484-519Google Scholar) to reveal lipid-containing components. LSIMS analyses were carried out as described previously (35Lawson A.M. Chai W. Cashmore G.C. Stoll M.S. Hounsell E.F. Feizi T. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 200: 47-57Google Scholar, 36Chai W. Cashmore G.C. Carruthers R.A. Stoll M.S. Lawson A.M. Biol. Mass. Spectrom. 1991; 20: 169-178Google Scholar). Native oligosaccharides (∼1 μg) were analyzed after applying onto the target using thioglycerol as liquid matrix and neoglycolipids were analyzed directly on chromatograms after TLC. For methylation analysis of oligosaccharides, permethylation (37Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Google Scholar), hydrolysis, reduction, acetylation, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis were performed as described previously (38Scudder P. Lawson A.M. Hounsell E.F. Carruthers R.A. Childs R.A. Feizi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 585-593Google Scholar). A modification was introduced into the procedure to include reduction of carboxymethyl groups (39Waeghe T.J. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Albersheim P. Carbohydr. Res. 1983; 123: 281-304Google Scholar) after permethylation to detect uronic acid residues as their hexitols. The retention time of −2Manol was established from the partially methylated alditol acetate standard prepared from the disaccharide alditol Manα1-2Manol. This was differentiated from −3Manol, −2Galol, and −2Glcol prepared from Manα1-3Manol, Fucα1-2Galol, and Glcβ1-2Glcol, respectively; the retention times being 10.03, 9.81, 10.07, and 10.32 min for partially methylated alditol acetate of −3Manol, −2Glcol, −2Manol, and −2Galol, respectively. Hybridoma cells secreting the HNK-1 monoclonal antibody (7Abo T. Balch C.M. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 1024-1029Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), and antibody containing ascites fluid was produced by standard procedures following inoculation of BALB/c mice. Antibody binding to neoglycolipids chromatographed on HPTLC plates was assayed as described (40Stoll M.S. Mizuochi T. Childs R.A. Feizi T. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 661-664Google Scholar), using a 1:500 dilution of ascites overlaid at room temperature for 2 h. 3-Sulfoglucuronyl neolactotetraosylceramide (HNK-1 glycolipid) isolated from bovine cauda equina (a gift of Dr. F. B. Jungalwala; Eunice Kennedy Shriver Center, Waltham, MA) was used as a positive control. In antibody binding experiments using the neoglycolipids obtained in the small scale experiments, HNK-1 immunoreactivities were observed predominantly in the most acidic fractions, As2 (Fig. 5), and not in the neutral fractions N and Ns (not shown). The binding was to minor components which showed negligible primulin staining (not shown). Among the neoglycolipids derived from the reducing oligosaccharides released by hydrolysis with ethylamine, multiple immunoreactive components were detected, chromatographing in the tri-/tetrasaccharide and higher oligomer regions. In the same chromatogram binding experiment, using neoglycolipids derived from acidic oligosaccharides released by hydrazinolysis, immunoreactivity was observed just above the point of application (this is the position of migration of neoglycolipids derived from multi-antennary N-glycosidic oligosaccharides), 2C-T. Yuen, W. Chai, R. W. Loveless, A. M. Lawson, R. U. Margolis, and T. Feizi, unpublished observations. and at a position corresponding to tri-/tetrasaccharide neoglycolipids. The hydrazine-released oligosaccharides were not investigated further in the present study. TLC-LSIMS analyses of the HNK-1 immunoreactive neoglycolipids derived from subfraction g of fraction As2 (Table I) of the ethylamine-released oligosaccharides gave [M − H]− ions at m/z 1475 (position a, Fig. 5), and m/z 1840 (position b), consistent with the compositions HSO3·HexA·Hex2·Hex NAc·DPPE and HSO3·HexA·Hex3·HexNAc2·DPPE, respectively (results not shown). These findings, with the evidence in each case for the presence of an additional hexose, suggested the presence of the HNK-1 epitope on oligosaccharides having reducing-end hexose residues that may have been generated by peeling of O-glycosidic oligosaccharides. Having detected HNK-1 positive components among oligosaccharides in the small scale reductive experiment (Fig. 5), a larger scale alkaline borohydride reaction was undertaken to minimize peeling. When converted to neoglycolipids after periodate oxidation, the oligosaccharide alditol fractions 1A2c and d yielded a triplet of strongly immunoreactive components i, ii, and iii and a weakly immunoreactive component, iv (Fig. 6). Fractions 2A2c, d, and e and 3A2d, e, and f also yielded immunoreactive components at positions i and ii, but in addition there were components with decreasing mobilities v, vi, and vii in fraction 2A2, and vii, viii, and ix in 3A2 (Fig. 6). The acidic oligosaccharide alditol fractions 1A2c, 2A2d, and 3A2f with the strongest HNK-1 immunoreactivities as neoglycolipids (Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6) were selected for negative ion LSIMS analyses as the free oligosaccharides. They were deduced to contain sulfated tetra- to octasaccharides with uronic acid in five of seven of them (Table III) as follows. The mass spectrum of 1A2c with [M − H]− at m/z 802 and a fragment ion (loss of 80 Da) at m/z 722 (Fig. 7) was consistent with that of a reduced tetrasaccharide HSO3·HexA·Hex2·HexNAc. This composition is the same as that of one of the components detected as a neoglycolipid (at position a, Fig. 5) among ethylamine-released oligosaccharides. Oligosaccharide analogs of 1A2c containing an additional HexNAc and additional Hex·HexNAc were deduced to be in fraction 2A2d; the latter corresponded to the immunoreactive component detected (at position b, Fig. 5) in the ethylamine experiment. Analogs of 1A2c with additional Hex2·HexNAc2 and dHex·Hex2·HexNAc were deduced to be in fraction 3A2f and the other oligosaccharide alditols to contain sulfate, dHex·Hex3·HexNAc (fraction 2A2d) and dHex·Hex4· HexNAc2 (fraction 3A2f). On account of its relative homogeneity, fraction 1A2c was investigated in the greatest detail as follows.TABLE IIIThe [M − H]− ions and deduced monosaccharide compositions for the underivatized forms of the three oligosaccharide alditol fractions which showed the strongest HNK-1 immunoreactivity when examined as neoglycolipidsFraction[M − H]−Composition1A2c802HSO3·HexA·Hex2·HexNAc2A2d917HSO3·dHex·Hex3·HexNAc1005HSO3·HexA·Hex2·HexNAc21167HSO3·HexA·Hex3·HexNAc23A2f1282HSO3·dHex·Hex4·HexNAc21458HSO3·HexA·dHex·Hex4·HexNAc21532HSO3·HexA·Hex4·HexNAc3 Open table in a new tab The 1A2c-derived triplet of immunoreactive neoglycolipid bands i, ii, and iii (Fig. 6) gave [M − H]− ions at m/z 1357, 1387, and 1417, respectively (Table IV; see also Fig. 7 for band ii). Band iv gave too weak a spectrum for interpretation. The 30-Da differences in the molecular ions derived from bands i to iii are indicative of increments of CHOH arising from different positions of periodate cleavage of a terminal hexitol residue at consecutive C-C bonds (41Chai W. Stoll M.S. Cashmore G.C. Lawson A.M. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 239: 107-115Google Scholar). This is illustrated for 2-substituted mannitol 3Other monosubstituted hexitols would give a different combination of cleavage fragments although not all cleavages would occur with equal abundance. For example, a 3-substituted hexitol should be cleaved between C1 and C2, C4 and C5, and C5 and C6 to give R-(C2-C6), R-(C1-C4), and R-(C1-C5), respectively; a 4-substituted hexitol should be cleaved between C1 and C2, C2 and C3, and C5 and C6 to give R-(C2-C6), R-(C3-C6), and R-(C1-C5), respectively; and a 6-substituted hexitol should be cleaved between C1 and C2, C2 and C3, C3 and C4, and C4 and C5 to give R-(C2-C6), R-(C3-C6), R-(C4-C6), and R-(C5-C6), respectively. in Scheme 1, where R = oligosaccharide and the resulting neoglycolipids contain remnants of the reduced hexitol with three, four, or five carbons. On this basis, and the deduced composition of the free, non-oxidized oligosaccharide alditol 1A2c (Table III), the [M − H]− ions of the triplet of neoglycolipids were interpreted to arise from neoglycolipids with the composition HSO3·HexA·Hex·HexNAc-X-DHPE, where X = the hexitol-derived fragments, C3H5OH (band i), C4H6(OH)2 (band ii), and C5H7(OH)3 (band iii).TABLE IV.Molecular and fragment ions in the mass spectra, and the deduced compositions or sequences of the neoglycolipid bands shown in Fig. 6, that were bound by HNK-1 antibodyBand[M − H]−FragmentationsComposition/sequenceaSequences given by mass spectra are indicated by dashes; where sequence information was not obtained, the components are separated by periods.

https://openalex.org/W2067744893,"Structures of the N-linked oligosaccharide attached to the heavy chain of a heterologous murine IgG2a produced from Trichoplusia ni (TN-5B1-4, High Five) insect cells were characterized. Coexpression of the chaperone immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) in the baculovirus-infected insect cells increased the soluble intracellular and secreted IgG level. This facilitated the detailed analysis of N-glycans from both intracellular and secreted IgG. Following purification of the immunoglobulins using Protein A-Sepharose, glycopeptides, prepared by trypsin-chymotrypsin digestion, were further digested with glycoamidase from sweet almond emulsin to obtain the oligosaccharide moieties. The resulting oligosaccharides were then reductively aminated with 2-aminopyridine and the structures identified by two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography mapping (Tomiya, N., Awaya, J., Kurono, M., Endo, S., Arata, Y., and Takahashi, N. (1988) Anal. Biochem 171, 73-90). The N-glycans obtained from the secreted IgG contain 35% complex type, some with terminal galactose residues at either α1,3-Man or α1,6-Man branches of the Man3GlcNAc2 core. The remaining oligosaccharides detected in the secreted IgG were principally hybrid (30%) and paucimannosidic (35%) type N-glycans. Most (84%) of these secreted glycoforms contained fucose α1,6-linked to the innermost GlcNAc residue and the presence of a potentially allergenic fucose α1,3-linked to the innermost GlcNAc residue was also detected. In contrast, the intracellular immunoglobulins included 50% high mannose-type N-glycans with lower levels of complex, hybrid, and paucimannosidic-type structures. Reverse phase one-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the IgG N-glycans in the absence of heterologous BiP exhibited a similar distribution of intracellular and secreted glycoforms. These studies indicate that Trichoplusia ni TN-5B1-4 cells are capable of terminal galactosylation. However, the processing pathways in these cell lines appear to diverge from mammalian cells in the formation of paucimannosidic structures, in the presence of α1,3-fucose linkages, and in the absence of sialylation. Structures of the N-linked oligosaccharide attached to the heavy chain of a heterologous murine IgG2a produced from Trichoplusia ni (TN-5B1-4, High Five) insect cells were characterized.

Following purification of the immunoglobulins using Protein A-Sepharose, glycopeptides, prepared by trypsin-chymotrypsin digestion, were further digested with glycoamidase from sweet almond emulsin to obtain the oligosaccharide moieties. The resulting oligosaccharides were then reductively aminated with 2-aminopyridine and the structures identified by two-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography mapping (Tomiya, N., Awaya, J., Kurono, M., Endo, S., Arata, Y., and Takahashi, N. (1988) Anal. Biochem 171, 73-90). The N-glycans obtained from the secreted IgG contain 35% complex type, some with terminal galactose residues at either α1,3-Man or α1,6-Man branches of the Man3GlcNAc2 core. The remaining oligosaccharides detected in the secreted IgG were principally hybrid (30%) and paucimannosidic (35%) type N-glycans. Most (84%) of these secreted glycoforms contained fucose α1,6-linked to the innermost GlcNAc residue and the presence of a potentially allergenic fucose α1,3-linked to the innermost GlcNAc residue was also detected. In contrast, the intracellular immunoglobulins included 50% high mannose-type N-glycans with lower levels of complex, hybrid, and paucimannosidic-type structures. Reverse phase one-dimensional high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the IgG N-glycans in the absence of heterologous BiP exhibited a similar distribution of intracellular and secreted glycoforms. These studies indicate that Trichoplusia ni TN-5B1-4 cells are capable of terminal galactosylation. However, the processing pathways in these cell lines appear to diverge from mammalian cells in the formation of paucimannosidic structures, in the presence of α1,3-fucose linkages, and in the absence of sialylation. Insect cells have been widely utilized as hosts for the production of numerous glycoproteins through the baculovirus expression system (1Luckow V.A. Summers M.D. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 47-55Google Scholar, 2Luckow V.A. Shuler M.L. Wood H.A. Granados R.R. Hammer D.A. Protein Production and Processing from Baculovirus Expression Vectors. Baculovirus Expression Systems and Biopesticides. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 51-90Google Scholar). Native insect cell glycoproteins also serve as models for developmental processes in eucaryotes (3Williams P.J. Wormald M.R. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Parker G.F. Roberts D.R. Biochim. Biophys.

While the structure, synthesis, and function of oligosaccharides in mammalian glycoproteins are well characterized, information on the carbohydrate structures and processing pathways present in insect cells is limited and sometimes contradictory (5Kubelka V. Altmann F. Kornfeld G. März L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 148-157Google Scholar, 6März L. Altmann F. Staudacher E. Kubelka V. Montreuil J. Schachter H. Vliegenthart J.F.G.

Glycotechnol. 1996; 8: 101-114Google Scholar). The oligosaccharides in glycoproteins can play critical roles in cellular targeting, structural stability, resistance to proteolysis, immunogenicity, and circulatory half-life (8Lis H. Nathan S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1-27Google Scholar, 9Varki A. Glycobiol. 1995; 3(2): 97-130Google Scholar). With insects representing more than half of the animal species classified (5Kubelka V. Altmann F. Kornfeld G. März L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 148-157Google Scholar), there is a need to obtain more information on the carbohydrate structures and processing of glycoproteins from insect cells. Many initial studies of N-glycans in insect cell-derived heterologous glycoproteins indicated the presence of only high mannose-type or short truncated, paucimannosidic oligosaccharides, 1n this study, high mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharides refers to structures Man4-9GlcNAc2. Paucimannosidic structures contain Man3-2GlcNAc2 with or without attached fucose residues at the innermost GlcNAc residue. Hybrid structures include a terminal GlcNAc, Gal, sialic acid, or another non-Man residue attached to either the α1,3- or α1,6-Man branch of the Man3GlcNAc2 core. Complex structures include a terminal GlcNAc, Gal, sialic acid, or another non-Man residue attached to both α1,3- and α1,6-Man branches. sometimes containing L-fucosyl 2All sugars are of D-configuration except for fucose which is L-configuration. residues (6März L.

V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands1995: 543-563Google Scholar, 7Altmann F. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1996; 8: 101-114Google Scholar). These observations confirmed the earlier studies of endogenous insect cell glycoproteins which were similarly found to lack complex carbohydrate structures (10Butters T.D. Hughes R.C. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 61: 159-168Google Scholar, 11Butters T.D. Hughes R.C. Vischer P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 640: 672-686Google Scholar, 12Butters T.D. Hughes R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 640: 655-671Google Scholar). It was presumed that insect cells did not possess the capacity to synthesize complex-type oligosaccharides since the levels of sialyl-, galactosyl-, and N-acetylglucosamine transferases were found to be insignificant (12Butters T.D. Hughes R.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 640: 655-671Google Scholar). In contrast, studies with the recombinant human plasminogen indicated that insect cells could synthesize complex N-linked oligosaccharides (13Davidson D.J. Fraser M.J. Castellino F.J. Biochem. 1990; 29: 5584-5590Google Scholar). Several more recent studies on homologous glycoproteins also have indicated that certain insect cell lines can synthesize hybrid and complex oligosaccharides.

Analysis of the native membrane glycoproteins from three insect cell lines, Mamestra brassicae (MB-0503), Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf21), and Bombyx mori (Bm-N), revealed the presence of a small percentage of hybrid N-glycans with GlcNAc at the reducing termini (5Kubelka V. Altmann F. Kornfeld G. März L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 148-157Google Scholar). Some of these structures were difucosylated with both α1,3- and α1,6-linkages at the innermost GlcNAc residue. The presence of sialic acids has also been reported for recombinant glycoproteins secreted from Trichoplusia ni larvae (16Davis T.R. Wood H.A. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. Anim. 1995; 31: 659-663Google Scholar). Some of these structural features of N-linked oligosaccharides were further justified by the detection of GlcNAc transferase I and II (17Altmann F. Kornfeld G.

Freedman R.B. Jenkins N. Patel K. Rooney B.C. Bio/Technology. 1996; 14: 197-202Google Scholar). Although the Ea-4 cells were observed to generate multiple complex and hybrid glycoforms, the Sf9 cells were observed to produce only hybrid N-glycans. We felt that an examination of the carbohydrate structures obtained from both intracellular and secreted sources would provide further insights into the oligosaccharide processing pathways present in insect cell lines. Therefore, the N-glycans of a heterologous immunoglobulin G produced by baculovirus-infected insect cells were characterized using two-dimensional HPLC analysis of 2-aminopyridine-modified oligosaccharides (23Takahashi N. Tomiya N. Takahashi N. Muramatsu T. Handbook of Endoglycosidases and Glycoamidases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 199-332Google Scholar). The immunoglobulin was purified from the cell lysate and culture medium of baculovirus-infected T. ni (TN5-B1-4, High Five) cells, a popular host cell line for the production of heterologous proteins. To generate sufficient soluble intracellular and secreted immunoglobulin for subsequent oligosaccharide analysis, coexpression of the chaperone, immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP), was utilized. This chaperone has been shown to prevent immunoglobulin aggregation and enhance soluble intracellular and secreted IgG levels from baculovirus-infected insect cells (24Hsu T.-A. Eiden J.J. Bourgarel P. Meo T. Betenbaugh M.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 595-603Google Scholar, 25zu Pulitz J. Kubasek W.L. Duchene M. Marget M. von Specht B.-U. Domdey H. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 651-654Google Scholar, 26Hsu T.-A. Betenbaugh M.J. Biotech. Prog. 1997; 13: 96-104Google Scholar). Subsequent one-dimensional HPLC analysis of the N-glycans in the absence of heterologous BiP indicated that the coexpression of BiP did not significantly alter the particular glycoforms observed. A comparison of the carbohydrates from intracellular and secreted IgG indicated significant structural differences between N-glycans obtained from the two sources and helped to elucidate further the N-linked oligosaccharide processing pathway in insect cells. Furthermore, a comparison of the N-glycans with those produced in mammalian cells can illustrate the similarities and differences that exist in insect and mammalian processing pathways. T. ni insect cells (BTI-TN5B1-4, known commercially as High Five) were obtained from Invitrogen (Portland, OR) and grown in ExCell 401 or ExCell 405 medium from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS). The medium was supplemented with 5 mM glutamine/penicillin-streptomycin from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). The Sephadex G-15, Protein A-Sepharose beads, column, and fast protein liquid chromatography are products of Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden). Phosphate-buffered saline, Triton X-100, Tris, iodoacetamide, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, trypsin, and chymotrypsin were purchased from Sigma. The membrane tubing was supplied by Spectrum Medical Industries, Inc. (Houston, TX). Glycoamidase A (EC 3.5.1.52, from sweet almond, commercially available as glycopeptidase A), β-galactosidase, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, and α-mannosidase (jack bean) were purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo). α-L-Fucosidase (bovine kidney) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany).

The following materials were purchased from the sources indicated: Dowex 50W-X8 (H+) and Dowex 1 (CO32−), from Dow Chemical Co. (Midland, MI); sodium cyanoborohydride, Aldrich; 2-aminopyridine, Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Recombinant baculovirus, JPLH, containing genes for the heavy and light chains of a mouse IgG2a under the control of separate polyhedrin promoters, was kindly provided by Domdey (27Davis T.R. Shuler M.L. Granados R.R. Wood H.A. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1993; 29A: 842-846Google Scholar). This IgG, directed against lipoprotein I of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been secreted as a fully assembled functional H2L2 complex including attached carbohydrates (24Hsu T.-A. Eiden J.J. Bourgarel P. Meo T. Betenbaugh M.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 595-603Google Scholar, 25zu Pulitz J. Kubasek W.L. Duchene M. Marget M. von Specht B.-U. Domdey H.

One N-linked glycosylation site was found on the constant region of the heavy chain coded by JPLH. 5H. Domdey, personal communication. N-Linked glycosylation sites were not observed on the light chain. Recombinant baculovirus coding for murine BiP, AcBB-BiP, has been described (24Hsu T.-A. Eiden J.J. Bourgarel P. Meo T. Betenbaugh M.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 595-603Google Scholar). T ni (BTI-TN5B1-4, High Five) (27Davis T.R. Shuler M.L. Granados R.R. Wood H.A. In Vitro Cell. & Dev. Biol. 1993; 29A: 842-846Google Scholar) insect cells were maintained at 27°C in 150-ml shaker flasks containing 30 ml of culture medium (ExCell 401 or ExCell 405) rotated at 120 rpm. For IgG production, cells were maintained and infected in 1.0-liter shaker flasks (28Summers M.D. Smith G.E. A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Insect Cell Culture Procedures. Texas Agricultural Experiment Station and Texas A&M University, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar). High Five insect cells were grown in a shaker flask to 3 × 106 cells/ml and then subcultured into 300 ml of culture medium in two separate shaker flasks. These were infected at a cell density of 1 × 106 cells/ml with the baculovirus JPLH with and without AcBB-BiP at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for each virus. This multiplicity of infection was used to ensure simultaneous infection of all cells by two different viruses. One hundred ml of fresh medium was added to supplement the partially spent medium at 0, 24, and 48 h post-infection. At 72 h post-infection, cells were separated from culture supernatant by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 5 min using a Beckman JR-21 centrifuge. IgG was then purified separately from the cell culture supernatant and cell lysates. Intact cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and resuspended in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM iodoacetamide, pH 7.5) containing 1 mM freshly added phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Both supernatant and cell lysates were clarified at 20,000 rpm for 20 min using the JR-21 centrifuge at 4°C. Clarified samples were loaded onto a 10-ml Protein A-Sepharose column on an fast protein liquid chromatography at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Bound IgG was eluted with 20 ml of elution buffer (50 mM acetic acid, 15 mM NaCl, pH 3.1) and the pH was adjusted to neutral immediately with 1 ml of 1 M Tris buffer (pH 7.5), in the collecting tube. Samples were dialyzed against 4 liters of deionized water in membrane tubing (Mr cut-off 12,000-14,000) at 4°C with 3 changes of water. Dialyzed samples were then lyophilized. Supernatant IgG (15 mg of protein correspond to 200 nmol of oligosaccharides) and lysate IgG (8 mg of protein) were heated at 100°C for 10 min. After digestion of IgG glycoproteins with trypsin and chymotrypsin (each 1%, w/w, of the substrate protein), at pH 8.0, the peptide/glycopeptide mixture was treated with glycoamidase A (0.5-1 milliunit) in 30 μl of 0.5 M citrate/phosphate buffer at pH 4.0 for 16 h to release the oligosaccharides. Finally, the mixture was digested with 1% (w/w) of Pronase to convert peptidic materials to amino acids and small peptides. The oligosaccharide fraction was purified by successively passing through columns (1 ml for each) of Dowex 50W-X8(H+) and Dowex 1(CO32−) (29Nakagawa H. Kawamura Y. Kato K. Shimada I. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 226: 130-138Google Scholar). The filtrate was evaporated to dryness and reductively aminated with a fluorescent reagent, 2-aminopyridine, and sodium cyanoborohydride (30Yamamoto S. Hase S. Fukuda S. Sano O. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 547-555Google Scholar). PA-oligosaccharides were purified by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-15 column with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The derivatization of sialyl oligosaccharides with 2-aminopyridine was quantitative and did not affect the sialic acid content. The PA-oligosaccharide mixture was first separated on a TSKgel DEAE-5PW (7.5 × 75 mm, Tosoh) column according to the sialic acid content. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 30°C using the two solvent components, A and B, as described previously (29Nakagawa H. Kawamura Y. Kato K. Shimada I. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 226: 130-138Google Scholar). Each oligosaccharide separated by the DEAE column was evaporated in vacuum without desalting and directly injected onto an ODS-silica column (Shimpack CLC-ODS, 6 × 150 mm, Shimadzu). All the subsequent experimental procedures including chromatographic conditions have been reported previously (31Tomiya N. Awaya J. Kurono M. Endo S. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 73-90Google Scholar). The elution volumes expressed as glucose units (using PA-derivatives of isomalto-oligosaccharides) are used as X-coordinates. The individual peak from the ODS column was applied to an amide-silica column (TSKgel Amide-80, 4.6 × 250 mm, Tosoh), and the elution volumes expressed as glucose units were used as Y-coordinates. Plotting all the X- and Y-coordinates constitutes the two-dimensional map, from which the structures of unknown oligosaccharides could be estimated by comparing their coordinates with those of the standard compounds of known structures. Each of the PA-oligosaccharides (50 pmol) isolated from the ODS and the amide columns was sequentially digested with exoglycosidases (β-galactosidase, β-N-acetylhexosaminidase, and α-L-fucosidase) under the conditions described previously (23Takahashi N. Tomiya N. Takahashi N. Muramatsu T. Handbook of Endoglycosidases and Glycoamidases. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 199-332Google Scholar). Sialidase from Arthrobactor ureafaciens (20 milliunits) was used to treat 500 pmol of the substrate in 15 μl of 0.1 M citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37°C for 16 h (29Nakagawa H. Kawamura Y. Kato K. Shimada I. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 226: 130-138Google Scholar). PA-oligosaccharide G (3 nmol) isolated by HPLC was desalted by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-15 column prior to NMR measurement. Characterization of linkage positions was with 1H NMR performed on a Bruker AM 400 spectrometer (400-MHz) as described previously (29Nakagawa H. Kawamura Y. Kato K. Shimada I. Arata Y. Takahashi N. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 226: 130-138Google Scholar). ESI (electrospray ionization) mass spectrum was measured with a double-focusing mass spectrometer JMS HX-110 (JEOL, Japan) equipped with an ESI ion source (Analytica of Branford). The mass spectrometer was operated at an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. The mass spectrum was acquired with a mass resolution of 1000 in the range of m/z 10,000-2000 by scanning a magnetic field in 22 s. The capillary tube was heated to 85-90°C to assist in the evaporation of solvent from the droplets. The capillary skimmer voltage was set to 150 V. Sample was dissolved in methanol/water (3:1, v/v) containing 1% acetic acid at a concentration of 5 pmol/μl, and infused into the ESI ion source at a flow rate of 1 μl/min by a Harvard syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus). Mass spectrum was processed with JEOL DA7000 data system. The High Five insect cells used in this study were infected with JPLH, coding for IgG2a, in the presence or absence of AcBB-BiP. Heterologous IgG was purified from the culture supernatant and soluble cell lysates using a Protein A-Sepharose column. Co-infection of High Five cells with JPLH and AcBB-BiP increased the amount of the soluble immunoglobulin purified from the culture supernatant and cell lysate by a factor of 4 and 8, respectively (data not shown). Since the coexpression of heterologous BiP provided much higher levels of soluble intracellular IgG, subsequent two-dimensional HPLC oligosaccharide analysis was performed on immunoglobulin samples from cells coinfected with JPLH and AcBB-BiP. Examination of the IgG samples from the JPLH + AcBB-BiP infection on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1) using nonreducing conditions revealed a prominent band corresponding to IgG purified from culture supernatant (lane 1) and cell lysate (lane 2). The identity of this protein as IgG with functional activity has been confirmed in prior immunoprecipitation, Western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay studies (24Hsu T.-A. Eiden J.J. Bourgarel P. Meo T. Betenbaugh M.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 595-603Google Scholar, 25zu Pulitz J. Kubasek W.L. Duchene M. Marget M. von Specht B.-U. Domdey H. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 651-654Google Scholar, 26Hsu T.-A. Betenbaugh M.J. Biotech. Prog. 1997; 13: 96-104Google Scholar). More than 90% of the total carbohydrate of both supernatant and lysate IgGs was released as reducing oligosaccharides by the sequential digestion of the IgGs with protease and glycoamidase A, as analyzed by the orcinol-H2SO4 reagent (32Francois C. Marshall R.D. Neuberger A. Biochem. J. 1962; 83: 335-341Google Scholar) (data not shown). No acidic oligosaccharide was detected in the lysate IgG, but about 8% of the oligosaccharides from the supernatant IgG were retained on the DEAE column. The acidity, however, was shown not to arise from sialic acid. When the acidic fractions were treated with neuraminidase from A ureafaciens, there was no release of sialic acids. ODS chromatography of the acidic fractions resulted in several minor components different from the known sialylated oligosaccharides including those from human and murine IgGs. We did not continue to investigate these minor components because of their limited quantities. The PA-oligosaccharides derived from the supernatant and lysate IgGs were separated into 6 and 10 fractions, respectively, by reverse phase-HPLC on the ODS-silica column (Fig. 2). The fractions labeled A-L were collected separately and each was further fractionated by size using the amide-silica column. Oligosaccharide B was separated into B1 and B2, and oligosaccharide H was separated into H-1, H-2, and H-3, on the amide column (data not shown). The structures of all unknown oligosaccharides were determined by comparing their positions with those of the known standard oligosaccharides on the two-dimensional map (containing more than 400 reference oligosaccharides). Identification of a sample PA-oligosaccharide was confirmed by co-chromatography with a known PA-oligosaccharide on the ODS and amide-silica columns. For further confirmation, the sample PA-oligosaccharide and the standard PA-oligosaccharide were digested in parallel with several exo-glycosidases (α-L-fucosidase, β-galactosidase, and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase for supernatant and lysate IgG oligosaccharides, and α-mannosidase for lysate oligosaccharides). At each step of the trimming, the elution positions of the resultant PA-oligosaccharide were shown to be identical with the corresponding product from the standard PA-oligosaccharide, with the exception of oligosaccharide G (see below). The trimming and comparison was continued until both sample and standard PA-oligosaccharides yielded the common trimannosyl core, Manα1-6(Manα1-3)Manβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-4GlcNAc.

https://openalex.org/W2086604471,"Metal-catalyzed oxidation of proteins represents an important pathway of post-translational modification. We utilized human growth hormone (hGH), a protein with a well defined metal-binding site, to study the detailed mechanism of metal-catalyzed oxidation by ascorbate/Cu(II)/O2. Particularly His18 and His21 within the metal-binding site were oxidized, predominantly to 2-oxo-His with the incorporated oxygen originating from molecular oxygen, based on amino acid analysis, tryptic mapping, mass spectrometry, isotopic labeling, and 1H NMR. The anaerobic reduction of a hGH/Cu(II) mixture by ascorbate generated a hGH-Cu(I) complex with NMR spectral features different from those of native hGH and hGH/Cu(II). The anaerobic reaction of this hGH-Cu(I) complex with hydrogen peroxide resulted in the oxidation of His18 and His21, suggesting that a fraction of Cu(I) was bound at the metal-binding site of hGH. Site-specific oxidation of hGH required an intact metal-binding site and could largely (about 80%) be inhibited by the presence of ≥28% (v/v) 1-propanol which appears (i) to perturb the metal-binding site and (ii) to interact with a reactive oxygen species formed at the perturbed metal-binding site.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 797-821Google Scholar). Such site specificity is attributed to the generation of ROS at specific metal-binding sites, where the highly reactive ROS attack labile functional groups nearby rather than diffuse into the bulk medium. It has been shown that most of the enzymes labile to MCO require metals for activity (13Stadtman E.R. Oliver C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2005-2008Google Scholar). The oxidation of these enzymes is less sensitive to the inhibition by exogenous ROS scavengers than would be expected on the basis of known rate constants for the reactions of specific ROS with these scavengers. However, one problem associated with all these studies is that neither the oxidizing species nor the intermediary protein-transition metal complexes formed during MCO of proteins have been well characterized. This is most pertinent to copper-catalyzed oxidation (i.e. to the frequently used ascorbate/Cu(II)/O2 system) involving the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox couple (2Stadtman E.R. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1990; 9: 315-325Google Scholar). Here, Cu(II) will most probably require a different geometry and different ligands within the protein ligand sphere than Cu(I). An initial reduction of Cu(II), bound to a metal-binding site, to Cu(I) may change the geometry of the protein-metal complex, and possibly even release Cu(I) from the metal-binding site. On the other hand, the metal may be retained when (i) the protein is flexible enough to adapt to the new geometrical requirements of the reduced metal, or (ii) re-oxidation of the metal by molecular oxygen or reduction products of molecular oxygen such as superoxide or hydrogen peroxide occurs faster than the release of the reduced metal from the metal-binding site. In a recent example for electron transfer coupled ligand dynamics in the model complex Cu(I/II)(TTCN)2, we could show that oxidation of tetrahedral [Cu(I)(TTCN)2]+ potentially led to the loss of a ligand to yield [Cu(II)(TTCN)(H2O)3]2+ before geometrical reorganization around the Cu(II) atom allowed the addition of TTCN to give the final product, octahedral [Cu(II)(TTCN)2]2+. 2Sanaullah, Hungerbühler, H., Schöneich, Ch., Morton, M., Vander Velde, D. G., Wilson, G. S., Asmus, K.-D., and Glass, R. S. (1997) J. Am. Chem. Soc., in press. Analogous mechanisms may lead to kinetic complexities during protein oxidation which may be reflected in oxidation yields and kinetics as well as the nature of the oxidation products. One amino acid particularly affected by MCO is histidine (His) (15Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11823-11827Google Scholar, 16Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11828-11833Google Scholar, 17Farber J.M. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4574-4578Google Scholar). There is as yet no detailed mechanism available for His oxidation in proteins, except a crystallographic study which showed the feasibility of metal-catalyzed processes within the metal-binding domain of glutamine synthetase (18Liaw S.-H. Villafranca J.J. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7999-8003Google Scholar). However, such mechanisms and reaction stoichiometries are important to recognize, particularly in light of the fact that His oxidation products such as 2-oxo-His have been proposed as general markers for oxidative stress in vivo (19Uchida K. Kawakishi S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 208-210Google Scholar). In this work, we report a detailed mechanistic investigation of the ascorbate/Cu(II)/O2-induced oxidation of His in a selected model protein, human growth hormone (hGH), with the particular objective to identify the nature of the oxidizing species and the structural requirements for MCO of hGH. Ascorbate/Cu(II)/O2 has not only been used extensively as a non-enzymatic model oxidizing system but is of physiological relevance to conditions of oxidative stress. hGH was chosen because of its well characterized metal-binding site which shows high affinity for divalent metal ions, such as Zn(II) and Co(II) (20Cunningham B.C. Mulkerrin M.G. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 253: 545-548Google Scholar). This site consists of His18 and His21 from helix I, and Glu174 from helix IV. The primary sequence of hGH is displayed in Fig. 1 (21Pearlman R. Bewley T.A. Wang Y.J. Pearlman R. Stability and Characterization of Protein and Peptide Drugs: Case Histories. Plenum Press, New York1993: 1-58Google Scholar). Recombinant hGH (lyophilized form) and its synthetic tryptic fragment T3 (Ala-His-Arg) were provided by Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). The protein was exchanged into a desired buffer by ultrafiltration using Microcon-10 microconcentrators from Amicon, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Typically 10 mg of hGH were dissolved in 500 μl of 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, the solution transferred into the microconcentrator and centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge. Subsequently, the protein was washed three times with 250 μl of 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The protein was finally taken up in a total volume of 4.5 ml of 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and the concentration of hGH in the stock solution determined by UV absorption at 277 nm where A2770.1% = 0.82 cm−1 (22USP Pharmacopeial Forum, (1989) The United States Pharmacopeia (1990), 22nd Ed., p. 1246, Mack Printing Co, Easton, PA.Google Scholar), [MWhGH = 22,125] (21Pearlman R. Bewley T.A. Wang Y.J. Pearlman R. Stability and Characterization of Protein and Peptide Drugs: Case Histories. Plenum Press, New York1993: 1-58Google Scholar). The Met14 sulfoxide derivative T2ox of the tryptic fragment T2 was obtained synthetically: first, an amount of about 1.5 nmol of authentic T2 was obtained by tryptic digestion of hGH (conditions see below), purification by reversed-phase HPLC (conditions see below), and lyophilization. The fragment was redissolved in 100 μl of neutral water and reacted for 12 h with 10 mM hydrogen peroxide. The only product of this reaction was T2ox which was purified by reversed-phase HPLC and characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Sequencing grade trypsin was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI); 1-propanol-d7 (CD3CD2CD2OH) and 18O-labeled water (95-98% atom pure 18O) were from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc. (Andover, MA). All other reagents were of the highest grade commercially available. Unless specified otherwise, the oxidation of hGH by the ascorbate/Cu(II)/O2 system was carried out under the following conditions (referred to as “standard conditions”): 200-μl solutions containing 18 μM hGH, 10 μM CuCl2, 100 μM ascorbate, and 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, were incubated at 25°C in 2-ml vials. In this way sufficient oxygen was available in the headspace of the vial to replenish oxygen in the reaction solution consumed through the oxidation of ascorbate. The reagents were sequentially added in the following order: water, hGH (in phosphate buffer), CuCl2, and ascorbate. The reaction was started by the addition of ascorbate, although switching the order of CuCl2 and ascorbate did not affect the reaction kinetics or final yields (data not shown). All solutions were made with doubly distilled deionized water. The phosphate buffer stock solution was treated with Chelex 100 resin (Bio-Rad; 5 g/100 ml) to minimize metal contamination. Stock solutions of CuCl2 and ascorbate were freshly prepared prior to the reactions. Atmospheric oxygen was excluded in some reactions. Since purging inert gas through the protein-containing solutions and even freeze-thaw cycles would cause foaming and denaturation of the protein, a special piece of glassware was designed to saturate the protein reaction mixture with N2. The glassware of an H-shape was made of two small top-end-open glass tubes joined in the middle. The reaction mixture was placed in one side of the device and H2O in the other (solution surfaces below the joint). The two openings were then fitted with rubber septa, and two hypodermic needles were used as the N2 gas inlet (needle immersed in H2O) and outlet (needle above the reaction solution), respectively. Before the inlet, N2 gas was purified from residual oxygen contamination by an OxiClear disposable gas purifier (LabClear, Oakland, CA). This whole setting enabled the efficient removal of O2 without protein denaturation or solvent evaporation. Other reagents, purged with N2 separately, were added through the rubber septa using a gas tight syringe. Tryptic digestion of hGH samples was performed at an initial dose of trypsin: hGH = 1:50 (w/w) in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37°C. A second equivalent dose was added after 2 h, and the samples were incubated for another 4 h. The digest was then quenched by cooling to 4°C. Intact hGH was monitored by weak anion exchange chromatography (AXC), reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC), and size exclusion chromatography with UV detection at 214, 230, or 278 nm. Tryptic maps were analyzed by RP-HPLC and cation exchange chromatography (CXC).

Open table in a new tab The quantitative analysis of ascorbate was performed by capillary electrophoresis equipped with an electrochemical detector. The capillary electrophoresis system employed a 50 μm × 70-cm fused silica capillary (Polymicrotechnologies; Phoenix, AZ), operating at 30 kV and 0.5 nA with 10 mM MES, pH 5.5, buffer as the mobile phase. The power supply was from Spellman High Voltage Corp. (Plainview, NY), and electrochemical detection was accomplished with an amperometric detector (model LC-4B; Bioanalytical Systems; West Lafayette, IN) employing a 33-μm carbon fiber electrode operating at 800 mV (versus Ag/AgCl). Prior to capillary electrophoresis with electrochemical detection analysis, the reaction samples were quenched by EDTA and filtered by Microcon-10 micro-concentrators to remove protein components. The 500 MHz 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-500 instrument. Typically 5 mg of hGH were exchanged into 400-800 μl of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer in D2O, pD 7.4, by ultrafiltration using Microcon-10 microconcentrators (see “Materials”) (the introduction of protons by 10 mM sodium phosphate into D2O can be considered negligible). When 1-propanol-d7 was used as a co-solvent (40%, v/v), it was added after the ultrafiltration. Before the addition of 1-propanol-d7, the pD was measured to be 7.4. The final concentrations of hGH in all NMR samples were 0.2-0.4 mM. The samples were then kept overnight at room temperature to ensure the exchange of amide protons with D2O before NMR analysis. Molecular weights of the purified tryptic fragments of hGH were analyzed by electrospray ionization (ESI) and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). ESI-MS experiments were performed on an Autospec-Q tandem hybrid mass spectrometer (VG Analytical Ltd., Manchester, United Kingdom) equipped with an OPUS data system. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were obtained on a Hewlett Packard model G2025A which exhibited an accuracy of typically ± 1 atomic mass unit for peptides with molecular masses below 3 kDa. The matrices for MALDI-TOF measurements (supplied by Hewlett Packard, Atlanta, GA) were 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid for peptides of mass >1 kDa and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid for peptides of mass <1 kDa. A Shimadzu spectrofluorometer (RF 5000U) was used to monitor the fluorescent behavior of the tryptophan residue after the oxidative modification of hGH (standard conditions). The excitation wavelength was set at 298 nm, and the emission spectrum was recorded between 310 and 400 nm. The presence of dityrosine, one potential oxidation product of tyrosine, was also examined by fluorescence spectroscopy with an excitation wavelength at 325 nm and emission spectra recorded between 400 and 500 nm (23Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 363-371Google Scholar). Circular dichroism (CD) measurements of hGH were performed on an AVIV model 60 DS spectrometer (Lakewood, NJ) essentially according to a published procedure (21Pearlman R. Bewley T.A. Wang Y.J. Pearlman R. Stability and Characterization of Protein and Peptide Drugs: Case Histories. Plenum Press, New York1993: 1-58Google Scholar). For the preparation of oxidized hGH for amino acid analysis, hGH (19 μM) was oxidized in 1 ml of solution (standard conditions). After a reaction time of 100 min, 100 μl of 0.1 mM EDTA were added, maintaining pH 7.4. The solution was divided into two aliquots of 550 μl, both of which were concentrated by centrifugation in a Microcon-10 microconcentrator and washed twice with 250 μl of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Both protein samples were then redissolved into 250 μl of 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and two 100-μl aliquots of each sample lyophilized in small vials. Assuming an approximately 30% loss of material as a result of centrifugation in the microconcentrators, each aliquot contains about 3.3 nmol of protein. The protein samples were hydrolyzed with 6 M HCl at 110°C for 20 h. Subsequent amino acid analysis was performed by Commonwealth Biotechnologies, Inc., Richmond, VA. During the oxidation of 18 μM hGH by 10 μM CuCl2 and 100 μM ascorbate in air saturated 10 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.4, AXC, pH 5.8, but not RP-HPLC revealed the rapid degradation of the hGH main peak paralleled by the appearance of two new more acidic peaks, implying the modification of some basic amino acid residues. Fig. 2 superimposes representative AXC chromatograms recorded immediately after the start (2 min) and at the end of a reaction (i.e. after complete consumption of ascorbate). The two major product peaks are indicated as peak 1 and peak 2. Each peak may contain more than one degradation product as suggested by the peak shoulders. The time profiles for their formation as well as for the consumption of hGH are shown in Fig. 3.Fig. 3Time course of hGH oxidation by ascorbate/Cu(II)/O2 as monitored by AXC (standard reaction conditions, see legend of Fig. 2; chromatographic conditions, see Table I); x axis: reaction time, y axis: % peak area relative to peak area of initial unoxidized hGH.The solid lines through the points are included for clarity but are not computer fits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Prior to the characterization of peak 1 and peak 2 in Fig. 2 the chemical modifications of a complete reaction mixture were characterized by tryptic mapping (see Fig. 1 for the primary sequence of hGH and the assignment of the tryptic fragments). Most of the tryptic fragments are well separated by RP-HPLC; complimentary tryptic mapping by CXC was used to monitor the T3 fragment, which is highly positively charged and elutes closely to the solvent front during the RP-HPLC analysis. Representative tryptic maps of native and oxidized hGH are displayed in Fig. 4 for RP-HPLC and Fig. 5 for CXC. Peak assignment in the RP-HPLC chromatogram was achieved by fraction collection and off-line analysis by ESI or MALDI-TOF MS. The identities of the respective peaks together with the theoretical and measured molecular masses are displayed in Table II. The retention behavior of the T3 fragment during CXC was confirmed by comparison to a synthetic standard.Fig. 5Representative chromatograms of tryptic maps analyzed by cation exchange chromatography of native and oxidized hGH.

Open table in a new tab A comparison of the chromatograms in Fig. 4, Fig. 5 reveals that a number of fragments were modified by the ascorbate/Cu(II)/O2 system, but T3 and T4 constituted the predominant targets. Table II summarizes the loss of each fragment and the yields of oxidation products. Two oxidation resistant fragments, T12 and T13, were chosen as the internal standards. Each oxidation product was quantified by comparing its peak area with the original peak area of its parent fragment in the unmodified protein, assuming similar response factors. Tryptic mapping by RP-HPLC in conjunction with off-line ESI-MS revealed several product peaks originating from T4 (labeled T4ox1 to T4ox3) with the total area of these peaks accounting for as much as 60% of the loss of T4. The major product (T4ox3) had a molecular weight corresponding to MWT4+ 16, implying the incorporation of an oxygen atom into T4. One minor product had MWT4+ 15 (T4ox1) which, considering the accuracy of our MALDI-TOF MS measurements of ± 1 atomic mass unit, might in fact correspond to MWT4+ 16. One additional minor product (T4ox2) corresponded to MWT4+ 50. Although T3 was well separated from the other fragments by CXC (which enabled the quantification of its loss), no new product peak was observed, suggesting that the products were less positively charged and co-eluted with the other earlier eluting fragments (Fig. 5). By RP-HPLC (Fig. 4), T3 (peak number 1) was barely resolved from the solvent front even with initially low concentrations of acetonitrile. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of peak number 1 suggested that it contained T3 as an exclusive compound. During the oxidation reaction, the loss of peak number 1 was accompanied by the emergence of a later eluting peak (peak number 2 in Fig. 4). MALDI-TOF MS analysis of peak number 2 revealed the presence of one major component with MWT3+ 16 and two minor components with MWT3+ 38 and MWT3+ 54. Peak number 2 is thus assigned as T3ox, the product of oxygen incorporation into T3. The two minor components likely represent the potassium adducts of T3 (MWT3+ 38) and T3ox (MWT3+ 54), respectively. Based on the peak areas of peak number 1 and peak number 2 in Fig. 4 it appears that T3 is nearly quantitatively converted into T3ox. In addition to oxidation products from T3 and T4, RP-HPLC also resolved a product peak, number 11, which had identical retention time and molecular weight as the synthetic standard of the Met14 sulfoxide variant of T2. This conversion is nearly quantitative, i.e. 10.1% loss of T2 compares to 9.7% gain of T2ox. The fragments T17-T18-T19 and T18-T19 suffered an approximately 10% loss which is, however, not accompanied by any detectable major product. The potential oxidation sites on these fragments are Met170 and/or Glu174. The Glu174 residue is the third component of the metal-binding site in addition to the two His residues (20Cunningham B.C. Mulkerrin M.G. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 253: 545-548Google Scholar). Met170, although buried in the hydrophobic core, is also located close to the metal-binding site according to the crystal structure of hGH (24De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A.

With no known sequence cues to designate which cysteines should be cross-linked in a native protein, the question arises as to how correct pairs of cysteines are selected during folding and how this selection is made quickly enough to be useful in the cell. The uncatalyzed formation of native disulfides during in vitro protein folding is generally not fast enough to support the folding rate that is found in the cell (1Goldberger R.F. Epstein C.J. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 628-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To overcome this, catalysis of disulfide formation and rearrangement in eukaryotes is provided by protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), 1The abbreviations used are: PDIrecombinant, rat protein-disulfide isomeraseDTTdithiothreitolRNasebovine pancreatic ribonuclease AsRNasescrambled RNasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis a 55-kDa protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (2Noiva R.

With some proteins, such as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, the specification of cysteine connectivity occurs early in folding and is directed by the formation of native-like structures that are interconverted by intramolecular disulfide rearrangements (3Goldenberg D.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 257-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). With other proteins, such as ribonuclease A (RNase), the identification of which cysteines to connect occurs late in folding resulting in a large collection of intermediates with random disulfides and substantial non-native structure that must be rearranged to give native connectivity (4Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 129: 411-4315Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). PDI is capable of accelerating folding that proceeds by either of these mechanisms (5Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Nature. 1993; 365: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 6Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 7Edman J.C. Ellis L.

During the oxidative folding of reduced ribonuclease (RNase), PDI catalyzes the initial formation of substrate disulfides to yield a collection of inactive, RNase redox isomers that must be rearranged to the native disulfide pattern (6Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). PDI has two active sites that are housed in two, internally homologous thioredoxin domains, one near the amino terminus and the other near the carboxyl terminus (7Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Both active sites contribute to PDI catalysis (8Vuori K. Myllyla R. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7211-7214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the two active sites are not equivalent (9Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30946-30952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the two active sites has two cysteine residues, found in the sequence WCGHCK (7Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The two cysteines at each active site serve different functions. The cysteine nearer the amino terminus of the domain (WCGHCK) is essential for all catalytic activity (10Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 11LaMantia M.L. Lennarz W.J.

Mutation of the cysteine closer to the carboxyl terminus (WCGHCK) selectively destroys the ability of PDI to catalyze disulfide formation. However, these mutants (NSO:COO and NOO:CSO) 2The nomenclature for describing mutations of the four active-site cysteines of PDI uses S to represent a sulfur nucleophile (cysteine) at a given active-site position and O to represent an oxygen nucleophile (serine) at this position. The two thioredoxin domains of the enzyme are designated the amino-terminal domain (N) and the carboxyl-terminal domain (C). Thus, the wild-type enzyme would be designated NSS:CSS. A mutant PDI with a single cysteine at the more amino-terminal position in the more carboxyl-terminal thioredoxin domain would be designated NOO:CSO. still retain a low but measurable amount of isomerase activity (10Walker K.W.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Formally, the rearrangement of substrate disulfides does not require the net oxidation or reduction of PDI or the substrate (Scheme I). A disulfide rearrangement initiated by the attack of a single active-site cysteine of PDI could propagate through the substrate and terminate by expelling PDI (13Saxena V.P. Wetlaufer D.B. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 5015-5022Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Consequently, we were surprised to find that PDI mutants with only one cysteine at an active site were considerably less effective than a wild-type active site in catalyzing rearrangements of RNase during oxidative folding of the reduced substrate (10Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The formation of “incorrect” disulfides that must be isomerized during folding creates logistical problems for a catalyst like PDI. Isomerization is initiated by the formation of a covalent complex between the active-site cysteine and the substrate protein. The incorrect structures must be searched and searched again, scanning, isomerizing, and breaking disulfides until the native structure is found. However, forming disulfides with a “random” collection of substrates could be dangerous, since the rate of intramolecular rearrangement would depend on the reactivity of the substrate cysteine with a substrate disulfide. If PDI were to find itself in a covalent complex with a substrate molecule that rearranged slowly, the enzyme could become trapped and unavailable to other substrate molecules. One solution to this problem could be provided by an active site with two cysteines, one to initiate substrate rearrangement and a second to enable an escape pathway. The experiments described below were performed to determine whether escape through the second active-site cysteine is a common event during PDI catalysis. The results suggest that escape is, in fact, the dominant mechanism for PDI-dependent isomerization of scrambled RNase. Recombinant rat PDI and its mutants were constructed, expressed, and purified as described previously. Glutathione (GSH), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase), urea, and dithiothreitol (DTT) were obtained from Sigma. Scrambled RNase was prepared by a minor modification of the method of Hillson et al. (14Hillson D.A. Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). RNase (10 mg/ml) was reduced at 37°C for 2 h with 140 mM DTT in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 M Tris·HCl at pH 8.3. The DTT was removed by ultrafiltration, replacing the reducing buffer with buffered 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride. Oxygen was bubbled into the solution with stirring at room temperature for several days until the residual thiol content was <0.1 mol of SH/mol of RNase. After ultrafiltration to remove the residual guanidinium hydrochloride and to exchange the buffer for 0.1% acetic acid, the scrambled RNase was stored at −80°C until use. The activity of PDI and its mutants in catalyzing the rearrangement of sRNase was determined with a continuous spectrophotometric assay in which the concentration of active RNase was monitored by refolding in the presence of the substrate, cCMP at 25.0°C in 0.1 M Tris·HCl, pH 8.0 (6Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate, including controls without PDI. Additional controls without cCMP showed that there was no significant absorbance contributed by RNase aggregation (9Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30946-30952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After correction of the observed rate of active RNase formation for the uncatalyzed reaction, Km and kcat values were estimated by non-linear least squares fitting to the equation of a rectangular hyperbola. Errors reported are the standard deviations of the parameter estimates. The inhibition constant (Ki) for substrate inhibition was determined by fitting to the equation v = Vmax [S]/([S] + Km+ [S]2/Ki) (15Plowman K.M. Enzyme Kinetics. McGraw-Hill, New York1972: 98Google Scholar). In this case, fitting had to be constrained by fixing Vmax at that observed in the presence of redox buffer. End point assays of the overall yield of the refolding reaction were performed with a discontinuous assay using cCMP as substrate. Percent activity recovered was determined relative to a sample of the same concentration of wild-type RNase. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204097) Google Scholar). Gels (12.5% polyacrylamide) were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. When presented with a fully reduced RNase substrate and a glutathione redox buffer, mutants of PDI with a single, reactive cysteine (NSO:COO and NOO:CSO) do not catalyze significant RNase oxidation, but they still catalyze isomerization of the spontaneously formed disulfides at a low, but significant, rate (10-20% of the wild-type kcat) (10Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To observe the isomerization reaction more directly without the complication of inefficient catalysis of substrate oxidation, the single-cysteine mutants, NSO:COO and NOO:CSO, were examined for catalysis of the isomerization of scrambled RNase where the substrate is completely oxidized (<0.2 mol of SH/mol of RNase). As with reduced RNase as a substrate, the single-cysteine mutants of PDI exhibit measurable, but low, activity at saturating RNase (Fig. 1). The kcat is only 10–12% that observed for the wild-type enzyme under the same conditions (Table I).TABLE I.Kinetic constants for the rearrangement of scrambled RNase by wild-type PDI and PDI mutantsEnzymekcataKm and Vmax values were determined by unweighted, non-linear least squares fitting to the equation for rectangular hyperbola.

Open table in a new tab The relatively low activity of a single-cysteine active site in catalyzing a simple rearrangement reaction is surprising. If the dominant isomerization mechanism involves an intramolecular rearrangement of the substrate induced by the attack of PDI the active-site cysteine of PDI (Scheme I), one active-site cysteine should be sufficient, and the presence or absence of a redox buffer would be expected to have little effect. However, when the glutathione redox buffer is omitted, the turnover numbers for the mutants, NSO:COO and NOO:CSO, are only 0.3-0.7% that of wild-type PDI (Fig. 2 and Table I). However, in the absence of a redox buffer, all (>90%) of the scrambled RNase is eventually converted to native enzyme suggesting that PDI inactivation by oxygen oxidation and the subsequent cessation of rearrangement is not responsible for the low activity. Furthermore, the decreased activity cannot be explained by an effect of mutation on the reactivity of the remaining cysteine, since Darby and Creighton (17Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16770-16780Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) found that the reactivity of the more amino-terminal cysteine in the amino-terminal thioredoxin domain of PDI was decreased only 2-fold by mutation of the more carboxyl-terminal cysteine to alanine. Thus, the simple mechanism of disulfide rearrangement (Scheme I) does not appear to account for PDI catalysis of RNase rearrangements. Fig. 2Catalysis of the rearrangement of scrambled RNase by PDI mutants in the absence of a glutathione redox buffer. Reactions were performed at 25°C, pH 8.0 (0.1 M Tris·HCl) using 3.5 μM PDI. Immediately before use, PDI was reduced with dithiothreitol and isolated by gel filtration (10Walker K.W. Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1972-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The initial rate of active RNase formation was determined continuously by performing the refolding in the presence of cCMP (6Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Note the difference in scale compared with Fig. 1. Individual points are the average of at least two independent determinations. ◯, NSO:COO; •, NOO:CSO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) If PDI were to indiscriminately scan folding intermediates for reactive disulfides, attack of the more amino-terminal, active-site cysteine on a random substrate disulfide might occasionally engage PDI in a slowly rearranging, covalent complex with substrate. In the wild-type active site, the second cysteine could prevent PDI from becoming trapped in these complexes by expelling the offending substrate, releasing PDI and the substrate for another round of catalysis. According to this model, the low activity of a single-cysteine active site would result from the inability of PDI to escape from such complexes. In such a system, GSH in the redox buffer would provide an intermolecular escape route and stimulate the activity of single-cysteine mutants. In support of this hypothesis, mutants with a single active-site cysteine (NSO:COO and NOO:COS) accumulate as covalent complexes between RNase and PDI, but the wild-type enzyme (NSS:CSS) does not (Fig. 3). Escape from the wild-type enzyme, mediated by the second active-site cysteine, would convert the active-site dithiol to a disulfide and release the RNase substrate with a reduced disulfide (Scheme II). In the absence of a redox buffer, where there is no alternative source of oxidizing or reducing equivalents, the oxidized PDI would have to find a reduced RNase substrate and reoxidize it to complete the reaction cycle. At higher concentrations of scrambled RNase this should become increasingly difficult, leading to substrate inhibition. As predicted, challenging reduced, wild-type PDI with higher and higher concentrations of sRNase, produces significant substrate inhibition if there is no redox buffer present (Fig. 4). However, if a redox buffer is available to recycle the oxidized PDI back to the reduced state and provide GSSG to oxidize the substrate, RNase rearrangements are not subject to inhibition by high scrambled RNase concentrations. Fig. 4The effect of redox buffer on the catalysis of the rearrangement of scrambled RNase by wild-type PDI. Reactions were performed at 25°C, pH 8.0 (0.1 M Tris·HCl) in the presence of 1 mM GSH and 0.2 mM GSSG using 3.5 μM PDI. The initial rate of active RNase formation was determined continuously by performing refolding in the presence of cCMP.

When the cysteine of one of the active sites of PDI attacks a substrate disulfide, the covalent intermediate that is formed can suffer three alternative fates (Scheme II). The substrate cysteine that has just been released from a disulfide bond scans the immediate environment for any disulfide that can be attacked. If it attacks the PDI-substrate disulfide, the disulfide that was originally present in the substrate simply forms again, and the substrate is released without rearrangement (Scheme II, path 3). Alternatively, rearrangement occurs when the substrate thiol attacks a sulfur that is different from the one to which it was originally paired (Scheme II, path 1). Scanning the substrate favors the attack of PDI on the most reactive disulfide, and subsequent scanning by the substrate thiol is biased toward replacing the more reactive disulfide with one that is kinetically less reactive (Scheme II, path 1). For reversible thiol/disulfide exchange, the kinetics of disulfide formation may parallel thermodynamic stability (18Gilbert H.F. Adv. Enzymol. 1990; 63: 69-172PubMed Google Scholar, 19Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 305-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar); consequently, scanning by PDI would favor the more stable arrangement of disulfides. The second (more carboxyl-terminal) cysteine at each of the active sites of PDI provides yet another choice to be made in the covalent enzyme-substrate complex. Superimposed on the bias toward substrate rearrangements that lead to increasing disulfide stability, the active-site cysteine provides a reductive escape mechanism to extricate the enzyme from slowly rearranging complexes. If scanning by the substrate thiol is too slow, the second active-site cysteine can discharge the substrate by an intramolecular reaction between the two active-site sulfurs (Scheme II, path 2). Intramolecular disulfide formation at the active site provides a clock to ensure that the enzyme does not become trapped in slowly rearranging, covalent complexes. The disulfide between glutathione and PDI is displaced by an intramolecular reaction between the two active-site cysteines with a half-time estimated at 20–100 ms (20Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 34: 11725-11735Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Thus, if kinetic scanning by the substrate does not succeed rapidly, wild-type PDI can escape from the complex by discharging the substrate. This escape mechanism provides another advantage; the offending substrate disulfide is reduced, which may make additional rearrangement/reoxidation pathways more accessible. The very low activity that is observed for single-cysteine active sites when intramolecular and intermolecular escape pathways are not available suggests that the dominant pathway for PDI-catalyzed rearrangement of sRNase involves reductive escape and reoxidation of the substrate rather than direct isomerization. The decision among reversal, rearrangement, and escape must be made multiple times, each time a covalent PDI-substrate complex is formed. Multiple cycles of kinetic scanning and reductive escape will ultimately lead to a native disulfide arrangement that is either resistant to the attack of PDI or in which partitioning is always toward reforming the original disulfide (Scheme II, path 3)."

It is not known, however, if detoxification is the primary physiological function of these transporters. The chromosomal organization of the gene encoding the Bacillus subtilis multidrug transporter Blt suggests a specific function for this protein; it forms a single operon with another gene, bltD, whose protein product is identified here as a spermine/spermidine acetyltransferase, an enzyme catalyzing a key step in spermidine degradation. Overexpression of the Blt transporter in B. subtilis leads not only to the multidrug-resistance phenotype but also to the efflux of large amounts of spermidine into the medium; this efflux is supressed by an inhibitor of Blt, reserpine. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the natural function of the Blt transporter is the efflux of spermidine, whereas multiple drugs may be recognized by Blt merely opportunistically.

Multidrug transporters, first discovered in mammalian cells (P-glycoprotein) (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar) and later found in yeast (2Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 71-76Google Scholar) and many species of bacteria (3Lewis K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 119-123Google Scholar, 4Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5853-5859Google Scholar, 5Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Google Scholar), pump structurally dissimilar toxic molecules, including many anticancer, antifungal, and antibacterial agents, out of cells. The ability of each multidrug transporter to recognize dozens of compounds that have no apparent structural consensus seemingly contradicts basic dogmas of biochemistry and remains enigmatic. Another unresolved question associated with multidrug transporters concerns their normal physiological functions. Because overexpression of these proteins causes an increase in cellular resistance to toxins, it is commonly believed that they have evolved to protect cells from diverse environmental toxic molecules. It is possible, however, that each multidrug transporter has a specific, presently unidentified natural substrate, e.g. some cellular metabolite, whereas multiple drugs are effluxed by them merely opportunistically. This latter hypothesis is indirectly supported by the analysis of the primary structures of multidrug transporters. More than two dozen known transporters capable of effluxing multiple drugs share no common sequence motif and belong to at least four distinct superfamilies of membrane proteins (1Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Google Scholar, 2Balzi E. Goffeau A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 71-76Google Scholar, 3Lewis K. Trends Biochem.

Furthermore, many multidrug transporters display strong homology to substrate-specific transporters. For example, human P-glycoprotein, the product of the MDR1 gene, is highly homologous to the protein MDR2, which does not efflux drugs but is a specific phosphatidylcholine flippase (6Ruetz S. Gros P. Cell. 1994; 77: 1071-1081Google Scholar). Similarly, the bacterial multidrug transporters Bmr and Blt of Bacillus subtilis and NorA of Staphylococcus aureus are highly homologous to the efflux transporters whose only known substrate is tetracycline (7Neyfakh A.A. Bidnenko V.E. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4781-4785Google Scholar–10Neyfakh A.A. Borsch C.M. Kaatz G.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 128-129Google Scholar). It has recently been demonstrated that P-glycoprotein transports not only drugs but also structurally diverse natural lipids across the membrane (11van Helvoort A. Smith A.J. Sprong H. Fritzche I. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. van Meer G. Cell. 1996; 87: 507-517Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the activity of the B. subtilis multidrug transporter Blt leads to the efflux of a natural cellular constituent, the polyamine spermidine. Moreover, the chromosomal organization of the Blt transporter gene, namely its association, within the same operon, with the gene encoding a spermidine-acetylating enzyme, strongly suggests that the efflux of spermidine is the primary physiological function of this protein. The bltD gene (8Ahmed M. Lyass L. Markham P.N. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3904-3910Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using B. subtilis DNA as a template and cloned into the vector pTrc99A (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) so that its expression was under the control of the vector trc promoter and ribosome binding site. The expression of BltD was induced in JM109 or CAG2242 E. coli cells transformed with this construct by incubating them for 3 h with 1 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside. Cells resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, were then lysed in a French press (10,000 psi) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h. BltD comprised approximately 10% of proteins in the supernatant. The protein extract of the BltD-expressing E. coli and a similarly prepared extract of control JM109 or CAG2242 E. coli cells were incubated in a 10-fold volume of 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 μCi/ml [14C]acetyl-CoA (Amersham Corp.) and 1 mM prospective BltD substrates, which were purchased from Sigma. After 15 min of incubation the samples were applied to a cellulose TLC plate and chromatographed in a n-butanol/pyridine/water (1:1:1) system. The position of the label was then revealed by autoradiography. Alternatively, 0.01 μCi of [14C]spermine or [14C]spermidine (Amersham Corp.) was incubated for 15 min in 10 μl of 50 mM Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, with 1 μl of the extracts of the CAG2242 E. coli either expressing or not expressing BltD and in either the presence or the absence of 100 μM acetyl-CoA. After incubation the reaction mixtures were chromatographed on a cellulose plate in n-butanol/acetic acid/water (12: 3: 5) and autoradiographed. Cells were treated with lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and then sonicated to disruption in 0.1 N HCl. Lysates were then adjusted to 0.2 N perchloric acid and clarified by centrifugation. Polyamines were then separated by HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh performance liquid chromatography and detected fluorimetrically as described elsewhere (12Seiler N. Knodgen B. J. Chromatog. 1980; 221: 227-238Google Scholar). To assess the polyamine efflux, B. subtilis cells were grown to A600 0.5, pelleted and resuspended to A600 2 in MG1 medium (13Bron S. Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biology Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 148Google Scholar). After 40 min of incubation at 37°C with intensive aeration, cells were removed by centrifugation, and the medium was filtered to remove remaining bacteria, supplemented with 0.2 N HClO4, and analyzed for polyamine content by HPLC (12Seiler N. Knodgen B. J. Chromatog. 1980; 221: 227-238Google Scholar). high performance liquid chromatography The B. subtilis multidrug transporter Blt, a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, effluxes from cells a number of toxic molecules, such as fluoroquinolone antibiotics, ethidium, rhodamine, tetraphenylphosphonium, acridine dyes, puromycin, doxorubicin, etc. (8Ahmed M. Lyass L. Markham P.N. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3904-3910Google Scholar). The only common features of these compounds are their moderate hydrophobicity and positive charge (the only electronegative substrate of Blt, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, may acquire a positive charge by chelating divalent cations (14Timmers K. Sternglanz R. Bioinorg. Chem. 1978; 9: 145-155Google Scholar)). We have shown previously that the blt gene is cotranscribed with another gene, bltD, which is located downstream of blt (8Ahmed M. Lyass L. Markham P.N. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3904-3910Google Scholar). The putative protein product of this gene, BltD, displays strong sequence similarity to a number of substrate-specific acetyltransferases that act by transferring acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA to the amino groups of either antibiotics, specific proteins, or polyamines (8Ahmed M. Lyass L. Markham P.N. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3904-3910Google Scholar). The fact that the blt and bltD genes comprise a single operon strongly suggests that the physiological functions of their protein products are closely related. Therefore, to identify the natural function of the Blt transporter, we attempted to determine the substrate specificity of the bltD-encoded enzyme. BltD was expressed in E. coli, and a number of potential substrates were tested for the ability to accept a radioactive label from [14C]acetyl-CoA in the presence of BltD-containing E. coli extract. The transfer of the label from [14C]acetyl-CoA to aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamycin, kanamycin, and sisomycin), some of the Blt-transported drugs (acriflavine and rhodamine 6G), polyamines (putrescine, cadaverine, spermidine, spermine, and norspermine), and miscellaneous organic amines (aniline, ethanolamine, benzylamine, lysine, p-aminobenzoic acid, and choline) was monitored by following a change in the chromatographic mobility of the label. Of all the substrates tested, only two polyamines, spermidine and spermine, served as acceptors of the label. To verify that BltD is indeed a spermine/spermidine acetyltransferase and not an activator of the endogenous E. coli enzyme, we expressed the protein in the E. coli strain CAG2242 (15Grossman A.D. Zhou Y.-N. Gross C. Heilig J. Christie G.E. Calendar R. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 939-943Google Scholar) that is deficient in polyamine acetylation (16Carper S.W. Willis D.G. Manning K.A. Gerner E.W. J. Biol Chem. 1991; 266: 12439-12441Google Scholar). Fig. 1 demonstrates that [14C]spermine changes its chromatographic mobility after incubation with acetyl-CoA and BltD-containing CAG2242 extract. A similar result was obtained with [14C]spermidine. The finding that BltD is a spermine/spermidine acetyltransferase was confirmed by HPLC analysis of the reaction products. The position of the HPLC peak corresponding to the product of spermidine acetylation by BltD coincided with the peak position of the N1-acetylspermidine but not of N8-acetylspermidine standard. Acetylation of spermine resulted in a product not detectable by the fluorimetric technique used in HPLC (12Seiler N. Knodgen B. J. Chromatog. 1980; 221: 227-238Google Scholar), suggesting modification of both its N1 and N12 primary amino groups. The product of [14C]spermine acetylation eluted in HPLC as a single peak; upon acid hydrolysis (6 M HCl at 110°C for 18 h) it was converted back to spermine. Finally, N1-acetylspermine incorporated an equimolar amount of labeled acetyl groups when incubated with BltD and [14C]acetyl-CoA. All these data indicate that BltD converts spermine into N1,N12-acetylspermine. BltD exhibits a high affinity for polyamines; the Km is 200 μM for spermidine and 67 μM for spermine, which makes it a more potent acetyltransferase than the E. coli spermidine acetyltransferase, whose Km for spermidine is at a millimolar level (17Fukuchi J. Kashiwagi K. Takio K. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22581-22585Google Scholar). More detailed description of the enzymatic properties of BltD will be published elsewhere. 2D. P. Woolridge and E. W. Gerner, manuscript in preparation. Spermidine comprises 90–95% of polyamines in B. subtilis, whereas spermine is present only in trace amounts (Fig. 2 and 18Ishii I. Takada H. Terao K. Kakegawa T. Igarashi K. Hirose S. Cell. Mol. Biol. (France). 1994; 40: 925-931Google Scholar). Under standard cultivation conditions neither Blt nor BltD are expressed in the control B. subtilis strain BD170 (thr-5, trpC2) (8Ahmed M. Lyass L. Markham P.N. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3904-3910Google Scholar) and no products of polyamine acetylation can be detected (Fig. 2). We have shown previously that the acfA mutation (19Siccardi, A. G., Lanza, E., Nielsen, E., Galizzi, A., Mazza, G., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 8, 370–376.Google Scholar) changes the sequence of the blt-bltD operon promoter making it constitutively active (8Ahmed M. Lyass L. Markham P.N. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3904-3910Google Scholar). This mutation was introduced into BD170 cells resulting in the BD170/acfA strain (8Ahmed M. Lyass L. Markham P.N. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3904-3910Google Scholar). HPLC analysis of polyamines in this strain revealed the presence of a significant amount of N1-acetylspermidine (Fig. 2), which was apparently due to the expression of BltD. In animal cells, polyamine acetylation is considered the rate-limiting step in polyamine degradation and results in depletion of the intracellular polyamine pools (20Casero R.A. Pegg A.E. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 653-661Google Scholar). Indeed, the amount of spermidine in the acfA-carrying cells was significantly reduced as compared with control cells; whereas BD170 cells contained 59 nmol of spermidine/mg of protein, BD170/acfA cells contained only 31 nmol of spermidine/mg of protein. The acfA mutation leads to the expression of not only BltD but also Blt. It was, therefore, tempting to speculate that spermidine is a substrate of not only BltD but also of the Blt transporter and that the Blt-mediated efflux of spermidine contributes to the reduction of the intracellular spermidine content in these cells. To verify this hypothesis, control BD170 cells and BD170/acfA cells were incubated for 40 min in a minimal medium, and the polyamines released into the medium were quantified by HPLC analysis. The results of these measurements supported our hypothesis that BD170/acfA cells efflux spermidine into the medium because these cells released four times more of this polyamine than did the BD170 cells (Fig. 3A). After incubation, as much as 24% of the total spermidine in the BD170/acfA culture was detected in the medium, whereas in the control BD170 culture this value was only 4%. Furthermore, reserpine, an inhibitor of the Blt transporter (8Ahmed M. Lyass L. Markham P.N. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3904-3910Google Scholar) dramatically reduced spermidine release from BD170/acfA cells to control levels while having no effect on spermidine release from control BD170 cells (Fig. 3A). A similar experiment was performed with a different pair of strains: BD224 (recombination-deficient strain isogenic to BD170) and the Blt-expressing strain BD224/pBLT (8Ahmed M. Lyass L. Markham P.N. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3904-3910Google Scholar), in which Blt is expressed from a plasmid vector. No BltD expression occurs in either of these strains. Nevertheless, the intracellular pool of spermidine was reduced in the Blt-expressing strain by more than a half as compared with the control strain (32 versus 79 nmol of spermidine/mg of protein). Accordingly, the amount of spermidine released into the medium was almost five times higher for the Blt-expressing strain than for the control strain, which again was dramatically inhibited by reserpine (Fig. 3B). The results presented here demonstrate that the activity of the B. subtilis multidrug transporter Blt causes the release of spermidine from bacteria. The fact that Blt is encoded within the same operon as BltD, which, as we showed here, is a specific enzyme acetylating spermidine, strongly suggests that spermidine is not simply one of the many possible substrates of Blt but rather that Blt has evolved as a specific spermidine-efflux protein. Apparently, B. subtilis uses the blt-bltD operon to down-regulate the amount of spermidine in the cell through two distinct mechanisms: efflux and chemical modification. The physiological conditions under which the expression of this operon is activated remain to be identified. The finding that spermidine appears to be a physiological substrate of Blt raises the intriguing question as to why Blt would also efflux multiple drugs. It is possible that to create an efficient transporter of spermidine, a relatively hydrophobic and positively charged but otherwise shapeless flexible molecule, evolution had to come up with a very nonselective substrate recognition site. As a result, Blt can opportunistically recognize and transport those multiple drugs that, like spermidine, are moderately hydrophobic and positively charged. It remains to be seen if all other multidrug transporters have specific, as yet unidentified, physiological substrates. We are grateful to Drs. A. S. Mankin, T. Tenson, and A. V. Chervonsky for critical reading of the manuscript."

Native LPO (nLPO) (3.2 mg) from Sigma was digested with Pronase (0.2 mg/mg of enzyme) in 50 mM Tris-HCl bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, by incubation for 4 h at 37°C. The sample was chromatographed by direct injection on a 250 × 4.6-mm C4 reverse phase column (Vydac). The prosthetic group was eluted with a linear gradient of 20–50% acetonitrile in water (containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) over 25 min with detection at 400 nm. The major peak representing the Pronase-released prosthetic group (retention time = 11.5 min) was collected and the sample lyophilized to dryness. The prosthetic group was then dissolved in methanol and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis by both MALDI and electrospray methods. The accurate mass of the sample was obtained using electrospray ionization and detection with an AutoSpec (Micro Mass Laboratories) magnetic sector instrument. C4 HPLC and activity assays were carried out on nLPO, rLPO, and H2O2-preincubated rLPO. Preincubation of rLPO with H2O2 was accomplished by adding 10 eq of H2O2 to the enzyme and incubating for 5 min at 25°C prior to analysis by HPLC and measurement of activity. HPLC was performed as described above for characterization of the prosthetic group. The proportion of covalently bound heme in the chromatographed rLPO samples corresponded to the percent of the total 400 nm integration represented by the holoprotein peak (retention time = 26.7 min). The activity assays contained ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (1.7 mM) in 50 mM potassium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, and enzyme (1 fmol) and were initiated with 2.5 mM H2O2. Formation of the ABTS radical cation was monitored at 416 nm. Specific activities were calculated as activity per Soret absorbance unit of the ferric enzyme added to each assay. rLPO (3 μM) in 0.1 M ammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.0, was incubated with H2O2 (3.3-34.5 μM) for 5 min at 25°C. Excess H2O2 was then consumed by incubation with catalase (5 units) for 5 min. Samples were chromatographed as described for prosthetic group characterization, with detection and integration at 400 nm. The sum of the integration values for the polar, free, and covalent heme peaks represents “total heme” for each chromatographic run. As part of an effort to elucidate the structure-function relationships that define diverse peroxidase activities, we have proteolytically digested native LPO with Pronase as done previously by Nichol et al (12Nichol A.W. Angel L.A. Moon T. Clezy P.S. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 147-150Google Scholar) to release the heme group. The MALDI spectrum of the heme thus isolated has a molecular ion at m/z 648 (i.e. heme plus 32 mass units). This was interpreted in the original studies as evidence for incorporation of a sulfur atom, but determination of the accurate mass of the heme derivative by electrospray mass spectrometry with an Autospec detector yields a value of m/z 648.1685. This value fits within 2 ppm of the expected value for incorporation of two oxygen atoms (calculated m/z 648.1671) but deviates by 30 ppm from the value for the incorporation of a sulfur atom (calculated m/z 648.1494). The heme isolated hydrolytically from LPO is thus a dihydroxy derivative rather that the originally postulated thiol species. Rae and Goff recently came to a similar conclusion based on the finding that the high- and low-spin ferric forms of the isolated heme(-peptide) display only two NMR methyl proton resonances and two new methylene resonances, as expected for hydroxylation of two of the heme methyl groups (13Rae T.D. Goff H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 2103-2104Google Scholar). The LPO structure is thus consistent with that of the heme in MPO except that the third link between a methionine and a heme vinyl is not formed. Failure to form this link is not surprising, because sequence comparisons indicate that in LPO a Gln replaces the critical Met found in MPO (10Dull T.J. Uyeda C. Strosberg A.D. Nedwin G. Seilhamer J.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 499-509Google Scholar, 11Newmyer S.L. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14891-14896Google Scholar, 12Nichol A.W. Angel L.A. Moon T. Clezy P.S.

Biochem. 1991; 198: 733-739Google Scholar). The prosthetic heme modification and binding, like their primary protein sequences, are thus very similar in LPO and MPO. A precedent for physiological covalent attachment of heme to a protein is provided by cytochrome c Cytochrome c maturation in bacteria, fungi, and yeast requires an enzyme, cytochrome c lyase, that catalyzes covalent attachment of the heme to the protein (15Thony-Meyer L. Loferer H. Ritz D. Hennecke H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1187: 260-263Google Scholar–18Xie Z. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4632-4639Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether a comparable enzyme is required for heme modification and attachment in the mammalian peroxidases. To address this question, we have successfully expressed bovine LPO in T. ni insect cells by infection with a recombinant baculovirus containing the LPO gene. The recombinant protein (rLPO) thus obtained in yields of ∼5 mg/liter is indistinguishable from the native protein (nLPO) by a number of criteria. The electronic absorption spectra of rLPO and nLPO are identical, with Soret maxima at 412 nm and Soret bandwidths of 45 nm. rLPO co-migrates with nLPO on both SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and C4 reverse phase HPLC and cross-reacts with a polyclonal antibody raised to nLPO (19Vilja P. Lumikari M. Tenovuo J. Sievers G. Tuohimaa P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 141: 277-284Google Scholar) (not shown). To examine the extent of heme attachment in the baculovirus-expressed rLPO, we developed an HPLC system in which noncovalently bound heme dissociates from the protein and is separated from the covalently bound heme. This HPLC system has been shown to determine whether a heme protein contains acid-dissociable or covalently bound heme. The pH of the eluting solvent is less than 1, which leads to protonation of the proximal histidine and the consequent rupture of its bond to the heme iron. This causes otherwise noncovalently bound hemes to dissociate from the apoprotein. Thus, both myoglobin and HRP yield a free heme species that is separable from the apoprotein, as evidenced by comparison of the chromatograms at 400 and 215 nm. On the other hand, nLPO yields a heme species that co-elutes with the 215 nm absorbing protein peak. As shown in Fig. 1 only 60% of the prosthetic heme is covalently bound in rLPO, in contrast to 100% in nLPO. The finding that 40% of the heme is associated noncovalently with rLPO yet the chromophore of the protein is indistinguishable from that of the native protein indicates that the unusual red-shifted Soret band of nLPO does not result from heme peripheral substitution and attachment to the protein (as proposed previously (20Andersson L.A. Bylkas S.A. Wilson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3406-3412Google Scholar)), but from noncovalent interactions within the protein milieu. Of the noncovalently bound heme, the majority is unmodified iron protoporphyrin IX (Fig. 1A, peak II). The minor polar peak (peak I) representing 7% of the total displays chromatographic behavior consistent with the addition of a single hydroxyl group to iron protoporphyrin IX. The presence of heme and a monohydroxylated derivative of heme in purified rLPO suggests that they are intermediates in the biosynthesis of the native diesterified heme. The possibility that heme oxidation and incorporation result from an autocatalytic process was tested by preincubating rLPO with H2O2 and determining the extent of covalent heme binding by HPLC. Indeed, the proportions of both the free heme and the polar heme product decrease, while the amount of protein-bound heme increases, as a function of the H2O2 concentration (Fig. 2). The covalent binding reaction is H2O2-dependent, rapid (complete in < 1 min), and yields a maximum of 90% covalently bound heme with excess H2O2 (9 μM) (Fig. 2). The spectrum of the protein is little altered by reaction with small amounts of H2O2 if higher valent iron species are reduced with ascorbate. When the oxidation of ABTS by rLPO is measured after preincubation with H2O2, the specific activity as a percent of the activity of nLPO is found to increase in parallel with the extent of covalent heme binding (Table I). LPO is thus active in the oxidation of exogenous substrates only after the heme is autocatalytically modified and covalently bound.TABLE IRelation of prosthetic heme covalent binding to the peroxidative activity of recombinant LPO in comparison with native LPOrLPO preincubation with H2O2Comparison with nLPO (1.00)ABTS oxidation per SoretProportion of total heme covalently bound−0.580.60+0.890.88 Open table in a new tab To establish that the covalent heme in rLPO is the same as that in the native enzyme, the hemes released by Pronase digestion were compared using reverse phase HPLC. As already discussed, nLPO yields as the major peak the dihydroxymethyl-modified heme (Fig. 3A). This species is also isolated from rLPO (Fig. 3B), confirming that the autocatalytic modification in rLPO is identical to that in the native protein. Furthermore, a new polar heme peak with a retention time of 17.5 min, in addition to the polar peak at 16 min found also in rLPO (peak I in Fig. 1), is obtained by proteolysis of rLPO. This peak, like peak I, appears to be a monohydroxylated heme because it elutes with authentic 8-hydroxymethylheme isolated from an incubation of horseradish peroxidase with phenylhydrazine (21Ator M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1542-1551Google Scholar). Given that the heme in MPO is a 1,5-dihydroxymethyl heme derivative (8Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Google Scholar, 9Taylor K.L. Strobel F. Yue K.T. Ram P. Pohl J. Woods A.S. Kinkade J.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 635-642Google Scholar), the 16- and 17.5-min peaks probably correspond to the 1- and 5-monohydroxymethyl derivatives, although which is which is not clear. These polar hemes may derive from the monoester intermediates in the pathway to the final diester product because they disappear (along with part of the unmodified heme) in parallel with the increase in the dihydroxymethyl derivative when rLPO reacts with H2O2 (Fig. 3C). Heme and the two polar hemes are present not only in rLPO but also in nLPO, as detailed examination of the chromatogram of the native Pronase-digested protein shows they are present at levels of between 0.1 and 1% of the total heme absorption (not shown). The correspondence between the native and recombinant proteins argues that free heme and the polar hemes derived from the heme-rLPO monoesters are intermediates in the normal autocatalytic maturation of LPO. LPO can thus be expressed in vitro, and the recombinant protein is indistinguishable from the native protein except for the degree of covalent heme modification (Fig. 1). Incomplete covalent incorporation of heme into the isolated protein suggests that heme associates with the protein intracellularly and that there is insufficient exposure to H2O2 in the insect cell prior to its secretion across the cell membrane in the present efficient secretory expression system. Formation of the covalently bound heme-protein complex is the result of an autocatalytic process, as indicated by the increase in the extent of covalent binding when the protein is incubated with H2O2 in the absence of other factors. Furthermore, consumption of the monohydroxylated heme species derived from heme·rLPO monoesters during the H2O2-supported reaction (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3) supports their identification as intermediates in the process. The fact that the in vitro attachment plateaus when ∼90% of the heme is covalently bound may reflect either binding of a portion of the noncovalently bound heme somewhere other than in the active site, the presence of a subpopulation of autocatalytically incompetent protein, or self-inflicted oxidative damage to a fraction of the enzyme during the autocatalytic process. Autocatalytic heme incorporation into LPO is likely to result from protein-mediated heme co-oxidation. A mechanistic precedent for this is provided by the formation of 8-hydroxymethyl heme in the reaction of HRP with phenylhydrazine, in which the phenyl radical functions as the co-oxidizing species (21Ator M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1542-1551Google Scholar). Thus, reaction with the first equivalent of H2O2 produces a 2-electron-oxidized Compound I intermediate, with one oxidizing equivalent present as a heme ferryl oxo (FeIV=O) species and the other residing on the protein as a free radical (Scheme 1) (22Taurog A. Dorris M.L. Doerge D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 24-32Google Scholar). Hydrogen abstraction from a heme methyl by the protein radical produces a methyl-centered radical, which is oxidized to the cation by intramolecular electron transfer to the ferryl oxygen. The benzylic carbocation is then trapped by the carboxylate side chain of an aspartate or glutamic acid residue to generate the protein-linked monoester (pathway a). A second cycle produces the second ester link. Alternatively, the cation may be trapped by water to yield a hydroxylated heme as a “dead end” product or, less likely, as an intermediate that undergoes esterification with the carboxylate side chains (pathway b). It is of interest in this context that maximal heme binding requires ∼8 eq (9 μM) of H2O2/heme group (Fig. 2), four times as much as predicted by Scheme 1, suggesting that the autocatalytic reaction is inefficient. One intriguing aspect of the mechanism is the requirement for oxidation of two methyl groups separated by a distance of >15 Å. Either there is enough conformational flexibility for one amino acid radical to swing from one site to the other, or two distinct amino acid radicals function as co-oxidizing species. Including the two amino acids involved in formation of the diester bonds, at least three amino acids appear to be intimately involved in covalent binding of the heme. The discovery that heme modification and attachment in LPO results from an autocatalytic process indicates that heme attachment in MPO, eosinophil peroxidase, and thyroid peroxidase is likely to be mediated by a similar mechanism rather than, as in the case of cytochrome c, by the action of one or more auxiliary enzymes. The role that heme modification and attachment plays in the function of the mammalian peroxidases is unclear, but the finding that the ABTS-oxidizing activity of LPO increases in parallel with the degree of heme covalent binding indicates that it is important. Covalent heme attachment may influence the redox potential, substrate binding, susceptibility to autoinactivation, or other parameters that govern productive catalytic turnover. We thank J. F.

It is a ligand for LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), CD43, rhinovirus, and fibrinogen, and it participates in cellular interactions by binding to its several ligands via different domains. ICAM-1 is expressed constitutively at low levels on lymphocytes, vascular endothelium, and a variety of other cell types (3Dustin M.L. Rothlein R. Bhan A.K. Dinarello C.A. Springer T.A. J.

It was originally thought that LFA-1 and ICAM-1 acted solely as adhesion molecules, strengthening otherwise weak interactions between cells. However, there is increasing evidence to suggest that ICAM-1 plays a signaling role. We showed that co-cross-linking of ICAM-1 (CD54) and MHC II induced expression of a functional IL-2 receptor on murine B cells (8Poudrier J. Owens T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1417-1427Google Scholar). In addition, ICAM-1 cross-linking has been shown to cause an oxidative burst in neutrophils (12Rothlein R. Kishimoto T.K. Mainolfi E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2488-2495Google Scholar) and to modulate anti-IgM induced changes in intracellular Ca2+ in a Burkitt's lymphoma cell line (13van Horssen M. Loman S. Rijkers G.T. Bloom S.E. Bloem A.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 154-158Google Scholar). Furthermore, an anti-ICAM-1 mAb modulated the release of interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor α, and IL-1 in T lymphocytes and monocytes (14Geissler D. Gaggl S. Most J. Greil R. Herold M. Dierich M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 2591-2596Google Scholar). These results support the idea that ICAM-1 is involved in signal transduction processes. Signal transduction by cell surface receptors is regulated by changes in the activity of specific kinases and/or phosphatases. The structure of ICAM-1 does not predict intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, therefore if ICAM-1 is to transduce signals, specific cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases must associate with the receptor. Among candidate receptor-associated protein-tyrosine kinases are members of the Src-related family of cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases, which includes several critical signaling molecules that have been shown to mediate signaling function both in lymphocyte development and in antigen responses (15DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 364-371Google Scholar, 16Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar). Also, tyrosine phosphorylation of the 34-kDa cdc2 protein kinase has been shown to be transiently induced in response to ICAM-1 cross-linking in T cells (17Chirathaworn C. Tibbetts S.A. Chan M.A. Benedict S.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5479-5482Google Scholar). The activation of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases can lead to downstream activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (18Carroll M.P. Clark-Lewis I. Rapp U.R. May W.S. J.

These mediate a number of functional cell changes, such as cell growth, differentiation, and gene induction (20Thomas G. Cell. 1992; 68: 3-6Google Scholar), and are known to be activated in leukocytes in response to stimuli.

LG1 is a BALB/c (Iad) CD4+ VB6+ T cell line that is specific for ovalbumin. When required, T cells were incubated at 1 × 106 cells/ml overnight in anti-CD3ϵ-coated microwells (10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). The cells were fixed at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml by incubation in 0.8% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 5 min, followed by incubation in 0.2 M lysine (Sigma) for 1 min. B cells were incubated at 5 × 107/ml at 37°C in culture medium for 10 min. mAbs, paraformaldehyde-fixed T cells, or PMA (Sigma) were added where appropriate and incubated for various amounts of time at 37°C. Cells were then cooled on ice, washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline + 1 mM NaVO4, and lysed by incubation in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 37 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM NaVO4, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mM NaF) for 15 min on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (10 min at 13,000 rpm). The protein content of each lysate was quantified using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce, Aurora, Ontario). Lysates were boiled for 5 min with an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol before loading. Equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. Following electrophoresis, separated proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario) at 100 V for 1 h. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (5% bovine serum albumin fraction V (Boehringer Mannheim, Laval, Quebec)) in wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween). Membranes were incubated with PY72.10.5 (1 μg/ml) in blocking buffer for 2 h followed by 125I-goat anti-mouse Ig (ICN, Mississauga, Ontario) for 1 h. Radioactivity was revealed by autoradiography and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Alternatively, membranes were probed with various primary antibodies and detected using the ECL system with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Corp., Oakville, Ontario) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Lysates were precleared twice by incubation at 4°C with Pansorbin (Calbiochem) for 30 min. Lysates were then incubated with 5 μg of anti-Lyn, anti-Fyn, and anti-Lck antisera followed by a 30-min incubation with Pansorbin. Pansorbin beads with bound protein were then washed three times in lysis buffer, and proteins were extracted by incubation in loading buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were cleared by centrifugation (30 s at 13,000 rpm), and supernatants were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels or used for kinase assays. After immunoprecipitation, Pansorbin beads with bound protein were washed three times in lysis buffer with 1 mM NaVO3, once with lysis buffer with 1 M NaCl, once with lysis buffer without inhibitors, and finally once with kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MnCl2, and 5 mM MgCl2). The samples were then resuspended in 25 μl of kinase bufffer containing 1 μM cold ATP and 1.5 μl of [γ32P]ATP and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Pansorbin beads with bound protein were then washed three times in lysis buffer, and proteins were extracted by incubation in loading buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were cleared by centrifugation (30 s at 13,000 rpm), and supernatants were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were fixed overnight in a 10% acetic acid, 30% methanol solution and were dried, visualized by autoradiography, and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Staining was performed with 20-min incubations of 5 × 105 cells/tube at 4°C with biotinylated mAb at concentrations ranging between 2 and 20 μg/ml, with phycoerythrin-coupled streptavidin (PharMingen, Mississauga, ON). Fluorescence was analyzed using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson, Mississauga, Ontario). Cell debris was excluded on analysis by side scatter gating. Contact with activated CD4+ T cells is a crucial step in B cell activation. To investigate the intracellular signaling events mediated by contact with activated T cells, we examined changes in protein tyrosine phosphorylation. A20 cells were coincubated for 1 h with resting or anti-CD3-stimulated paraformaldehyde-fixed T cells (LG1). Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting of whole cell lysates showed an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation of A20 incubated with activated T cells that was greater than the sum of the activated T and B cells alone (Fig. 1A). This was not the case when A20 were incubated with resting T cells. The fact that the T cells were fixed excludes a role for soluble cytokines. In addition, supernatant from activated LG1 did not have this effect (data not shown). Thus the tyrosine hyperphosphorylation seen was mediated by ligation of B cell surface receptors by coreceptors on activated T cells. In previous studies we had shown that ICAM-1/LFA-1 interactions make a critical contribution to contact signaling for B cells (29Poudrier J. Owens T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2993-2999Google Scholar) and therefore asked whether ICAM-1 signaling could contribute to the observed tyrosine phosphorylation. Increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation was detected when anti-ICAM-1 antibodies were cross-linked on A20 cells; this was detectable as early as 1 min (Fig. 1B). In particular, hyperphosphorylation of proteins in the molecular mass range of 50-60 kDa was observed. Similar results were obtained using another lymphoma line, TA3 (data not shown). Tyrosine hyperphosphorylation was not seen when either of the isotype-matched anti-MHC I (M1/42) or anti-Thy-1 (30H12) antibodies were substituted for anti-ICAM-1. Cross-linking ICAM-1 on splenic B cells up-regulated MHC II expression (8Poudrier J. Owens T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1417-1427Google Scholar). Analogous treatment of A20 cells induces similar MHC II expression (Fig. 2), showing that ICAM-1 has a signaling function in A20 cells analogous to that already described in non-transformed B cells. The proteins that were hyperphosphorylated following ICAM-1 signaling included some with molecular weights corresponding to those of the Src family of kinases. Upon activation, these kinases are autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues. We therefore immunoprecipitated several of these kinases (p53/p56,lyn p59fyn, and p56lck) from lysates of A20 cells that were either unstimulated or stimulated through treatment with cross-linked anti-ICAM-1. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Tyrosine phosphorylation of a pair of bands specifically precipitated by anti-p53/p56lyn was increased approximately 2-fold following ICAM-1 cross-linking, according to PhosphorImager analysis (Fig. 3). Greater than 1.2-fold hyperphosphorylation of the other kinases was not seen. An in vitro kinase assay verified that p53/p56lyn kinase was activated. This occurred within 1 min following ICAM-1 cross-linking and peaked at approximately 10 min (Fig. 4A). The quantitation of this experiment is shown in Fig. 4B The finding that ICAM-1 ligation resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins, including Lyn kinase, suggested that the Ras-Raf-1-MAPK/ERK kinase-MAPK pathway might also be activated, as changes in tyrosine phosphorylation induced by cell surface receptors have been implicated in this pathway of MAP kinase activation. The activation of both Raf-1 and MAPK is accompanied by a characteristic shift in their mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (30Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Escobedo J.A. Rapp U.R. Roberts T.M. Williams L.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 649-657Google Scholar, 31Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of cell lysates with anti-Raf-1 detected a protein with a molecular mass of 72 kDa, and a shift in electrophoretic mobility was detected within 1 min of ICAM-1 cross-linking (Fig. 5A). Immunoblotting with an anti-MAPK antibody detected two proteins of molecular masses 42 and 44 kDa, corresponding to ERK-2 and ERK-1, respectively (Fig. 5B). There was a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of ERK-1 within 1 min following ICAM-1 stimulation, similar to that seen in cells stimulated with the protein kinase C activator PMA. This was not observed when an isotype-matched control antibody, anti-MHC I (M1/42), was cross-linked on A20 cells indicating that the effect was not due to Fc-receptor engagement and was specific to ICAM-1. We find that M1/42 does not induce tyrosine hyperphosphorylation in A20 cells, so this lack of effect on MAPK was expected. Adhesion molecules of several families can transduce signals that influence the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The β2 integrins have been the most extensively studied (reviewed in 32Rosales C. Juliano R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 189-198Google Scholar). We have now investigated the mechanism of signal transduction through ICAM-1 in a murine B cell lymphoma line, A20. The interaction between ICAM-1 and LFA-1 is known to be important in B and T cell activation (4Wawryk S.O. Novotny J.R. Wicks I.P. Wilkinson D. Maher D. Salvaris E. Welch K. Fecondo J. Boyd A.W. Immunol. Rev. 1989; 108: 135-161Google Scholar, 9Martz E. Hum. Immunol. 1987; 18: 3-37Google Scholar, 10Berg N.N. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1694-1702Google Scholar, 11Boyd A.W. Wawyrk S.O. Burns G.T. Fecondo J.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3095-3099Google Scholar), and while there is evidence for a signaling function for ICAM-1 (8Poudrier J. Owens T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1417-1427Google Scholar, 12Rothlein R. Kishimoto T.K. Mainolfi E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2488-2495Google Scholar, 13van Horssen M. Loman S. Rijkers G.T. Bloom S.E. Bloem A.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 154-158Google Scholar), relatively little is currently known about the mechanism. We have now shown the activation, in B lymphoma cells, of the Src family kinase p53/p56lyn, as well as Raf-1 and MAP kinases. The fact that ligation of ICAM-1 resulted in MHC class II up-regulation confirmed that this cell surface molecule transduces biological signals in A20 cells. ICAM-1 cross-linking also induces rapid tyrosine hyperphosphorylation of a number of proteins, in both A20 cells and in another B lymphoma line, TA3. Similar protein tyrosine phosphorylation was induced in A20 by contact with fixed, activated T cells, and given that ICAM-1 is critical for this mode of B cell activation (29Poudrier J. Owens T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2993-2999Google Scholar), it is likely that ICAM-1 signaling contributes. We determined that one of the proteins that becomes hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine is p53/p56lyn kinase. Lyn kinase has been detected in various hematopoietic cells, including B cells (33Pleiman C.M. Abrams C. Timson Gauen L. Bedzyk W. Jongstra J. Shaw A.S. Cambier J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4268-4272Google Scholar), neutrophils (34Corey S.J. Burkhardt A.L. Bolen J.B. Geahlen R.L. Tkatch L.S. Tweardy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4683-4687Google Scholar), and eosinophils (35Pazdrak K. Schreiber D. Forsythe P. Justement L. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1827-1834Google Scholar). Two isoforms of the Lyn-encoded protein have been identified, p53 and p56, arising from differential splicing. Src-related kinases are autophosphorylated during the process of activation. An in vitro kinase assay confirmed that p53/p56lyn was activated as early as 1 min after ICAM-1 cross-linking. In contrast, p59lyn and p56lck were not phosphorylated upon tyrosine following ICAM-1 cross-linking. Tyrosine kinase activation resulting from such diverse stimuli as cytokines, growth factors, and T cell receptor ligation leads to the activation of MAP kinases (18Carroll M.P. Clark-Lewis I. Rapp U.R. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19812-19817Google Scholar, 19Gomez-Cambronero J. Colasanto J.M. Huang C. Sha'afi R.I. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 211-217Google Scholar). Members of the MAP kinase family are protein/serine/threonine kinases that require dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues for full activation (36Gomez-Cambronero J. Huang C.K. Gomez-Cambronero T.M. Waterman W.H. Becker E.L. Sha'afi R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7551-7555Google Scholar, 37Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Google Scholar). A unique type of dual threonine/tyrosine kinase known as MAPK/ERK kinase is primarily responsible for phosphorylation and activation of ERK. These dual specificity kinases are themselves activated by phosphorylation (38Ahn N.G. Seger R. Bratlien R.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4220-4227Google Scholar, 39Matsuda S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3277-3281Google Scholar). The kinase Raf-1 has been shown to activate MAPK/ERK kinase (40Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been implicated in the regulation of Raf-1, including its tyrosine phosphorylation by activated growth factor receptors (41App H. Hazan R. Zilberstein A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 913-919Google Scholar), serine/threonine phosphorylation by protein kinase C (42Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidl H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Google Scholar), and physical interaction with the GTP-binding Ras protooncogene family (43Williams N.G. Paradis H. Agrwal S. Charest D.L.

We found that ICAM-1 cross-linking resulted in a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of Raf-1 and ERK-1, indicating an activation of these kinases. We propose that ICAM-1 ligation allows association with and/or activation of Lyn resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Whether this functional association is indirect via other as yet undefined intermediates or occurs via generation of SH2 ligand phosphotyrosines on ICAM-1 itself remains to be determined. While the cytoplasmic domain of ICAM-1 contains two tyrosine residues, it does not contain the common tyrosine-containing motif ((D/E)X7(D/E)X2YX3LX7X2(L/I)) that has been shown to mediate Src family kinase binding to other receptors (46Koyasu S. Tse A.G.D. Moingeon P. Hussey R.E. Mildonian A. Hannisian J. Clayton L.K. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6693-6697Google Scholar). Nonetheless, Lyn has been demonstrated to bind to the common β chain of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-3, and IL-5 receptors, which also lack this motif (35Pazdrak K. Schreiber D. Forsythe P. Justement L. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1827-1834Google Scholar). Chirathaworn et al. (17Chirathaworn C. Tibbetts S.A. Chan M.A. Benedict S.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5479-5482Google Scholar) showed tyrosine hyperphosphorylation in primary and transformed human T cells stimulated with anti-ICAM-1 antibody. They identified as a substrate the cell cycle regulator cdc2 kinase and showed a corresponding transient inhibition of cdc2 kinase activity, implicating ICAM-1 in growth arrest. Although we have shown phosphorylation of substrates more commonly associated with cell cyle progression, preliminary experiments also show that ICAM-1 cross-linking inhibits growth of A20 cells. The role of activated Raf-1 and MAPK in such growth inhibition remains to be determined. The downstream effects of ICAM-1-mediated activation of Lyn, Raf-1, and MAP kinases are as yet unknown. In other systems, MAP kinases activate many cytosolic proteins such as phospholipase C, phopholipase A2, and nuclear transactivating factors such as nuclear factor IL-6, c-Fos, c-Myc, p62tcf, and others (37Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Google Scholar), thus mediating a wide range of activation and differentiable events. Raf-1 has been shown to activate nuclear factor-κB by directly phosphorylating its inhibitor, IκB (47Li S. Sedivy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9247-9251Google Scholar). ICAM-1 ligation induces up-regulation of MHC class II, up-regulation of cytokine receptors (8Poudrier J. Owens T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1417-1427Google Scholar), modulation of B cell receptor signaling (13van Horssen M. Loman S. Rijkers G.T. Bloom S.E. Bloem A.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 154-158Google Scholar), and induction of an oxidative burst in neutrophils (12Rothlein R. Kishimoto T.K. Mainolfi E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2488-2495Google Scholar). The biochemical signaling pathway that we have now identified may be involved in these responses. A future goal is to define the role of this and other signaling pathways in evoking specific cellular responses."

A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 14028-14034). Inhibitory potencies were dependent on isozyme type, the mode of activation of the respective isozymes, and on P-site ligand. For the nucleoside derivatives potency typically followed the order 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (2′,5′-ddAdo) > β-adenosine > 9-(cyclopentyl)-adenine (9-CP-Ade) ≥ 9-(tetrahydrofuryl)-adenine (9-THF-Ade; SQ 22,536), with the exception of Type II adenylyl cyclase, which was essentially insensitive to inhibition by 9-CP-Ade. For the adenine nucleoside 3′-polyphosphates inhibitory potency followed the order Ado < 2′-dAdo < 2′,5′-ddAdo and 3′-mono- < 3′-di- < 3′-triphosphate. Differences in potency of these ligands were noted between isozymes. The most potent ligand was 2′,5′-dd-3′-ATP with IC50 values of 40–300 nM. The data demonstrate isozyme selectivity for some ligands, suggesting the possibility of isozyme-selective inhibitors to take advantage of differences in P-site domains among adenylyl cyclase isozymes. Differential expression of adenylyl cyclase isozymes may dictate the physiological sensitivity and hence importance of this regulatory mechanism in different cells or tissues.

Adenylyl cyclase is potently and directly inhibited by analogs of adenosine via a domain referred to as the P-site from its requirement for an intact urine moiety (1Londos C. Wolff J. Proc. Natl.

Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 848-853PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, sensitivity of adenylyl cyclases to inhibition by these nucleotides varied among rat tissues. We suggested that diversity in P-site-mediated inhibition depended on the adenylyl cyclase isozyme and that this diversity may well dictate differences in pharmacological and possibly physiological influence of this inhibition in the respective tissues (17Bushfield M.

Although effects on cell function and on cellular cAMP levels have been uniformly consistent with P-site inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, potencies of a given compound differed among systems, and unexpected potencies of some ligands were noted in others. Since it was not possible in those earlier studies to establish which adenylyl cyclase isozyme(s) was(were) present, it is possible that variations in expected behavior may well have been due to differences in levels of expression of the several isozymes.

Detailed procedures for the preparation of Type II and Type VI enzyme have been described (33Pieroni J. Harry A. Chen J. Jacobowitz O. Magnusson R.P. Iyengar R. J. Biol.

All membranes were diluted at least 10-fold with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 8, and 5% glycerol before being diluted further into the adenylyl cyclase assay containing the same buffer.

HEK cells expressing Type VII enzyme were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (prepared from Sigma tablets P-4417), scraped from dished into a small portion of the buffered saline, collected by centrifugation, and then stored at −80°C. Membranes were prepared following lysing of the cells by N2 cavitation as described previously (28Cali J.J. Zwaagstra J.C. Mons N. Cooper D.M.F. Krupinski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12190-12195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 9-Cyclopentyl-9H-adenine was synthesized by amination of the corresponding 6-chloropurine that was itself prepared by alkylation, as adapted from Montgomery and Temple (34Montgomery J.A. Temple Jr., C.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 630-635Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A mixture of 6-chloropurine (5.57 g, 36 mmol), cyclopentyl bromide (6.56 g, 44 mmol), and K2CO3 in dimethyl sulfoxide (80 ml) was stirred at ambient temperature for 3 days. The reaction medium was diluted with water (700 ml), extracted with EtOAc (3 × 150 ml), washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, and purified by flash chromatography on silica gel; elution was with EtOAc:hexane (9:1) yielding 4.10 g (51%) of 6-chloro-9-cyclopentyl-9H-purine. A solution of 6-chloro-9-cyclopentyl-9H-purine (0.67 g, 3 mmol) and ammonia (20 mmol) in ethanol was heated at 90°C for 24 h. The medium was evaporated in vacuo, and the residue was dispersed in brine (20 ml), extracted with EtOAc (3 × 30 ml), washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, and purified by flash chromatography on silica gel, eluting with EtOAc:MeOH (95:5), yielding 0.36 g (59%) of 9-CP-Ade. The methanesulfonate salt was prepared by adding one equivalent of methanesulfonic acid to a solution of the free base in isopropyl alcohol. The crude salt was recrystallized from isopropyl alcohol. 3′-ADP was synthesized by a modification of the methods described by Mitchel et al. (35Mitchel R.E.J. Ward D.C. Tener G.M. Can. J. Biochem. 1967; 45: 89-99Crossref Google Scholar) and Sheridan et al. (36Sheridan R.C. McCullough J.F. Wakefield Z.T. Inorg. Synth. 1972; 13: 23-24Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The principal modifications are the use of sonication to facilitate the reaction, which otherwise would have been allowed to continue for 150 h (35Mitchel R.E.J. Ward D.C. Tener G.M. Can. J. Biochem. 1967; 45: 89-99Crossref Google Scholar), and the use of anion exchange chromatographic techniques to separate the several polyphosphorylated derivatives of adenosine obtained. This modified procedure represents a one-step preparation of nucleoside 3′-di- and 3′-triphosphates from the corresponding monophosphate and is characterized by a short reaction time and convenient reaction conditions. A suspension of 3′-AMP (1 g, 2.8 mmol) and phosphoramidic acid (1.63 g, 16.8 mmol) in 50 ml of formamide was sonicated under an argon atmosphere overnight. The temperature was maintained at 20–25°C by putting the ultrasonication bath in a cold box at 4°C. The medium was cooled to 5°C, diluted with 2 liters of cold water (5°C), and neutralized with triethylamine (2.8 ml, 20 mmol). Reaction products were purified on QAE-Sephadex (HCO3− form) with a linear gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate (0.01-0.3 M) followed by an isocratic elution with 0.3 M triethylammonium bicarbonate and then another linear gradient with triethylammonium bicarbonate (0.3-1 M) (Fig. 2). The appropriate fractions were lyophilized and then coevaporated several times with methanol, yielding 380 μmol (14%) of 3′-ADP and 14.6 μmol 3′-ATP. Both nucleotides were isolated as their respective sodium salts by precipitation in 1 M sodium iodide in acetone from the methanol solution of the triethylammonium nucleotide. The precipitate was centrifuged and washed three times with cold acetone and dried in vacuo giving the sodium salts of 3′-ADP and 3′-ATP. No impurities were noted by high performance liquid chromatography on a Spherogel TSK DEAE-5PW column eluted with a gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate.

[α-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals. Lubrol-PX was filtered through alumina (Neutral, AG7, from Bio-Rad) to remove peroxides. Dimethyl sulfoxide was redistilled under partial vacuum over CaH2. 2′,5′-ddAdo and the 3′-polyphosphates of 2′,5′-ddAdo and of 2′-dAdo were synthesized by methods reported previously from this laboratory (9Yeung S.-M.H.

Box 4000, Princeton, NJ 08543. Previously reported data suggested tissue-dependent differences in inhibitory potency of P-site ligands and also showed that activation of the enzyme by various agents resulted in different sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibition (17Bushfield M. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 38: 848-853PubMed Google Scholar). To ascertain whether these differences would be reflected in specific isozymes, the potency of 2′-d-3′-AMP was evaluated on recombinant bovine Type I, Type II, and Type VI adenylyl cyclases (Fig. 3 and Table I). IC50 values for inhibition of the rat brain 2Earlier comparisons of P-site ligands by our laboratory were mostly with the adenylyl cyclases isolated from either rat or bovine brain (4Johnson R.A. Yeung S.-M.H. Stübner D. Bushfield M. Shoshani I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 681-688PubMed Google Scholar5Stübner D. Johnson R.A.

Although these tissues express several adenylyl cyclases, the Type I isozyme predominates with the isolation techniques we used (11Tang W.-J. Krupinski J. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8595-8603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar24Krupinski J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.-J. Feinstein P.G. Orth K. Slaughter C. Reed R.R. Gilman A.G.

As expected, various stimulatory agents resulted in substantially different activities, with the greatest activity being uniformly obtained when assays were conducted with 5 mM Mn2+ and 100 μM forskolin. Reaction velocities with Mg2+ and forskolin were roughly similar to those noted with Mn2+ alone, and membranes assayed with Mg2+ exhibited the lowest activities. Furthermore, the Type I enzyme was most potently inhibited, whether activation was with Mn2+ (IC50∼4 μM) or Mn2+ and forskolin (IC50∼6 μM). This greater sensitivity of the Type I enzyme is consistent with previously published data with enzyme derived from a number of tissues (1Londos C. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The small increase in IC50 upon addition of forskolin is also consistent with earlier experiments with the bovine brain enzyme (5Stübner D. Johnson R.A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 248: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) but is in contrast with behavior of hepatic adenylyl cyclase (7Florio V.A. Ross E.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 195-202PubMed Google Scholar) and the Type VI enzyme. Although forskolin stimulated each adenylyl cyclase, its effect to enhance potency of P-site ligands varied among isozymes. Hence, potency is uncoupled from enzyme activity, suggesting that the processes of catalysis and inhibition might not be causally linked. One goal of these studies has been to identify P-site ligands that could be used pharmacologically on intact cells or tissues and exhibit isozyme-selectivity and possibly tissue selectivity for inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. That such tissue selectivity may occur is suggested from studies with a number of tissues and with the several recombinant isozymes presented above. Structure-activity relationships for P-site ligands have indicated a tolerance for ribose substitutions and replacements. Several of the membrane-permeable compounds that have been used by many investigators in studies with intact cells and tissues, and these include: 9-(β-d-arabinofuranosyl)adenine (Ara-Ade; IC50∼100 μM) (1Londos C. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5482-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), 9-THF-Ade (IC50∼10 μM; SQ 22–536), and 9-CP-Ade (IC50∼20 μM) (13Weinryb I. Michel I.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 334: 218-225Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These compounds were tested with several recombinant adenylyl cyclases, and significant differences in sensitivity were noted (Table II). The general order of sensitivity to P-site-mediated inhibition was Type I > Type VI ≈ Type VIIIA > Type II. For the classical P-site ligands, 2′-d-3′-AMP and 2′,5′-ddAdo there were smaller differences in ligand potency among enzyme Types I, VI, and VIIIA than were noted with the ribose-substituted ligands. For these ligands, each was significantly less potent with the Type II enzyme than with the other isozymes. An interesting compound was 9-CP-Ade, which was essentially inactive with the Type II enzyme (Fig. 4). There was greater than 1 order of magnitude difference in potency of 9-CP-Ade for the Type II adenylyl cyclase (IC50 >1 mM) compared with Type I (IC50∼109 μM) and Type VIIIA (IC50∼117 μM) (Table II and Fig. 4). This selectivity ratio of >10 is likely an underestimate since in some experiments the IC50 for 9-CP-Ade was >4 mM, giving a selectivity ratio >40. Although the above data indicate some isozyme selectivity for the ribose-modified set of P-site ligands, less pronounced differences in sensitivity were noted with the adenine nucleoside 3′-polyphosphates (Table III). Typically, potency followed the order Ado < 2′-dAdo < 2′,5′-ddAdo and for the 3′-phosphates: 3′-mono- < 3′-di- < 3′-triphosphate (cf. Refs. 15Désaubry L. Shoshani I. Johnson R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14028-14034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A comparison is shown in Fig. 5 for inhibition of the Type VI adenylyl cyclase. Although some differences were evident among the isozymes scanned in this study, e.g. Type II enzyme was least sensitive to P-site ligands, in general the more potent the compound the less selectivity was noted. For some isozymes the impact of the removal of the hydroxyl moieties was greater that with others. For example, the IC50 values for the 2′-deoxy- and 2′,5′-dideoxynucleotides for enzyme Types VII and VIIIA are little different, whereas for the Type II enzyme the difference is 1 order of magnitude (cf. Table III). Analogously, the effect on inhibitory potency of the sequential addition of phosphates to the 3′-position differed among these isozymes. For the 2′-deoxy series the largest difference in IC50 values for the Type II enzyme was between the 3′-di- and 3′-triphosphate derivatives, whereas for the Type VI enzyme it was between the 3′-mono- and 3′-diphosphate derivatives (Table III and Fig. 5). For enzyme Types VI, VII, and all three splice variants of Type VIII, IC50 values were little affected by the addition of the third 3′-phosphate group. The data suggest that inhibition by this class of ligand is a universal feature of adenylyl cyclase isozymes but that the structure of the respective isozymes influences potency of ligands, whether with ribosyl 2′- and 5′-hydroxyl or 3′-mono-, 3′-di-, or 3′-triphosphate groups. To begin establishing a basis for the known tissue dependence for inhibition of adenylyl cyclases by P-site ligands, the efficacy of several ribose-modified and 3′-polyphosphorylated adenosines has been tested on several recombinant forms of this enzyme family. The rationale for the study is that the physiological importance of this regulatory mechanism in a given tissue may be reflected in the sensitivity of the adenylyl cyclase expressed in that tissue. The degree of inhibition would depend on levels of P-site ligand, and these may change as a result of changes in cell function. Our additional consideration has been that ligands may be identified exhibiting selectivity toward individual isozymes. The influence of P-site inhibition in a given tissue may also be influenced by factors affecting activity of adenylyl cyclases. Although the data did not conform to the notion that sensitivity to inhibition by P-site ligands increased as enzyme activity increased (7Florio V.A. Ross E.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 195-202PubMed Google Scholar), they indicated that different means of activation of adenylyl cyclase led to differences in the IC50 values for inhibition (cf. Table I). For example, enzyme activity with Mn2++ forskolin was uniformly greater than that with Mn2+ alone, whereas the presence of forskolin led to increased sensitivity to inhibition by 2′-d-3′-AMP (Table I) or 2′,5′-ddAdo (not shown) with the Type VI enzyme but decreased sensitivity with Types I and II enzyme. Arguably the enzyme conformation resulting from activation by Mn2+ must differ from those resulting from Mn2++ forskolin, Mg2+, GTP·αs, GTP·αi, βγ, and appropriate combinations of these. Different conformations will exhibit greater or lesser sensitivity to inhibition by these agents, and this influence will be isozyme-dependent and may affect the physiological role of this inhibition. Potency of P-site ligands obviously depends also on ligand structure. This was particularly evident with the ribose-modified adenosine derivatives as the comparison was extended to several isozymes (Table II). For example, Type II adenylyl cyclase, unique in its regulation by G-protein subunits and susceptibility to phosphorylation by protein kinase C (31Tang W.-J. Gilman A.G. Science. 1991; 254: 1500-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar–33Pieroni J. Harry A. Chen J. Jacobowitz O. Magnusson R.P. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21368-21373Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), was insensitive to inhibition by 9-CP-Ade and was poorly sensitive to 9-THF-Ade. The differences in P-site potency among the isozymes were more acutely noted with ribose-modified adenine nucleosides than with the 3′-nucleotides. The addition of the 3′-phosphates contributes substantial binding energy (10 kcal/phosphate; 37Andrews P.R. Craik D.J. Martin J.L. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 1648-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) and may minimize the effects of differences in isozyme structure on ligand binding; that is, the differences among isozymes, noted by IC50 values for 9-CP-Ade (Fig. 4), may be masked by the increased binding affinities of the nucleoside 3′-polyphosphates (Fig. 5). An avenue for the development of isozyme-selective ligands may be to exploit the differences established here with the ribose-modified adenine nucleosides and the dramatic inhibitory potency of the adenine nucleoside 3′-polyphosphates, thereby also aiding investigation of enzyme structure and mechanisms of catalysis and inhibition.

The two kinesin motor domains are thought to move processively by operating in a hand-over-hand manner, although the mechanism of such cooperativity is unknown.

INTRODUCTIONUnderstanding how motor proteins generate force and movement from the chemical hydrolysis of ATP remains one of the most intriguing problems in biophysics. At present, there are three separate families of motor proteins found within eukaryotic cells: myosins, which move along actin filaments, and kinesins and dyneins, which move along microtubules (1Vale R.D. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 175-183Google Scholar). The motor domains that typify each of these superfamilies exhibit little or no amino acid sequence similarity, and hence it was believed that they had evolved separately and were structurally unrelated. However, the recently determined crystal structure of kinesin revealed an unexpected structural similarity to the core of the myosin motor domain, particularly in the nucleotide binding pocket (2Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 550-555Google Scholar, 3Sablin E.P. Kull F.J. Cooke R. Vale R.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 555-559Google Scholar). Hence, myosin and kinesin may share some similarities in how they generate unidirectional movement and force, although the precise mechanistic details remain to be elucidated for both types of motors.Kinesin has proven to be an excellent model system for investigating the mechanism of motility, in part due to the small size of its motor domain (>2-fold smaller than myosin's). Kinesin purified from tissue sources exists as an α2β2 heterotetramer, in which two α subunits (heavy chains) and two β subunits (light chains) associate to form a highly elongated molecule with globular termini (4Bloom G.S. Wagner M.C. Pfister K.K. Brady S.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3409-3416Google Scholar, 5Kuznetsov S.A. Vaisberg E.A. Shanina N.A. Magretova N.N. Chernyak V.Y. Gelfand V.I. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 353-356Google Scholar). The kinesin heavy chains are organized into four domains (listed from NH2 to COOH terminus): (i) a ∼325-amino acid residue globular motor domain head that contains the ATP and microtubule binding sites, (ii) a ∼50-amino acid residue region adjacent to the globular motor domain (termed the neck region) that is sufficient for allowing dimerization of the motor domains (6Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Google Scholar) and contains a sequence that is predicted to form an α-helical coiled coil (6Huang T.-G. Suhan J. Hackney D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16502-16507Google Scholar, 7Stewart R.J. Thaler J.P. Glodstein L.S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5209-5213Google Scholar), (iii) a long (∼450-amino acid residue) α-helical coiled-coil domain (termed the stalk), and (iv) a small globular COOH terminus (termed the tail) (8Hirokawa N. Pfister K.K. Yorifuji H. Wagner M.C. Brady S.T. Bloom G.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 867-878Google Scholar–11de Cuevas M. Tao T. Goldstein L.S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 957-965Google Scholar). Flexible “hinge” regions are found between the neck and the stalk and in the center of the stalk. The light chains (β subunits) of kinesin, which are not necessary for force-generation, are associated with the smaller globular COOH terminus of the heavy chain and may be involved in determining cargo specificity (8Hirokawa N. Pfister K.K. Yorifuji H. Wagner M.C. Brady S.T. Bloom G.S. Cell. 1989; 56: 867-878Google Scholar).A single kinesin molecule can move continuously along a microtubule for several micrometers in a series of 8-nm steps, which corresponds to the distance between tubulin binding sites along the microtubule protofilament (12Svoboda K. Schmidt C.F. Schnapp B.J. Block S.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 721-727Google Scholar). Such processive movement, which is not displayed by muscle myosin or ciliary dynein, very likely represents a specialized adaptation that enables a few kinesin motors to transport membrane organelles efficiently within cells. Functional studies on recombinantly expressed kinesin heavy chains have begun to uncover regions that are necessary for kinesin motility. Bacterial expression of the first 340 amino acids of the Drosophila kinesin heavy chain (which contains the core NH2-terminal globular motor domain and the first ∼10 amino acids of the neck) produces a monomeric protein that generates directed motility when many motors are interacting simultaneously with a single microtubule in gliding motility assays (7Stewart R.J. Thaler J.P. Glodstein L.S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5209-5213Google Scholar, 13Yang J.T. Saxton W.M. Stewart R.J. Raff E.C. Goldstein L.S. Science. 1990; 249: 42-47Google Scholar). However, these monomeric kinesins do not exhibit processive movement when assayed as individual motors in a single molecule fluorescence motility assay (14Vale R.D. Funatsu T. Pierce D.W. Romberg L. Harada Y. Yanagida T. Nature. 1996; 380: 451-453Google Scholar) or a bead assay (15Berliner E. Young E.C. Anderson K. Mahtani H.K. Gelles J. Nature. 1995; 373: 718-721Google Scholar). A kinesin motor containing the complete motor and neck domains, on the other hand, forms a dimer and also exhibits processive movement (14Vale R.D. Funatsu T. Pierce D.W. Romberg L. Harada Y. Yanagida T. Nature. 1996; 380: 451-453Google Scholar, 16Hackney D.D. Nature. 1995; 377: 448-450Google Scholar). Collectively, these studies suggest that the dimeric structure of kinesin is not essential for force-generation per se, although it does appear to be required for processive movement. This raises the possibility that processive movement may involve a hand-over-hand coordination of the two kinesin heads.The proposed α-helical coiled-coil domain in the kinesin neck may be structurally important for coordinating the activities of the two kinesin heads during processive movement. The existence of a coiled-coil structure in close proximity to the motor domains, however, raises important questions concerning its exact boundaries and stability, since the connection between the heads must be sufficiently extensible to allow the two motor domains to span the distance between two tubulin dimers during movement. It is also important to determine the thermodynamic properties of the neck coiled-coil to ascertain if it could partially or totally “un-coil” during the generation of a power stroke. Unfortunately, the atomic resolution structure of the neck domain is unknown, since the segment between residues 323 and 349 is disordered and hence invisible in the present electron density maps of human kinesin (hK349) (2Kull F.J. Sablin E.P. Lau R. Fletterick R.J. Vale R.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 550-555Google Scholar). Thus, to gain insight into the structure of the kinesin neck region and its possible functional roles, we have investigated the secondary structure of the human kinesin heavy chain neck region using several synthetic peptides in conjunction with CD spectroscopy.In the present study, we report that a two-stranded, α-helical coiled-coil dimerization domain exists between residues 330–369 within the human kinesin neck region, as predicted from previous work. Residues located to the COOH terminus of this region, 370–383, appear to be unstructured and are not significantly involved in further stabilization of the dimerization domain. Residues located to the NH2 terminus of the proposed coiled-coil dimerization domain may adopt a β-sheet secondary structure. Analysis of the stability of each peptide indicates that the heptads required to form a stable coiled-coil domain are arranged in a strong-weak-strong manner. Loss of two heptads from either the NH2 or COOH terminus significantly affects dimer stability. These results suggest that a conformational change in the motor domain, driven by a free energy change associated with ATP hydrolysis, could be transmitted in a manner that affects the stability and/or conformation of the adjacent neck region. We propose a model for kinesin motility in which unwinding of a portion of the coiled-coil domain plays an important role in the mechanochemical cycle.

The PTC1 oncoprotein has been demonstrated to be hyperphosphorylated (15Ishizaka Y. Shima H. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1441-1444Google Scholar) and to exert transforming activity in NIH3T3 cells (16Fusco A. Grieco M. Santoro M. Berlingieri M.T. Pilotti S. Pierotti M.A. Della Porta G. Veccio G. Nature. 1987; 328: 170-172Google Scholar). The causative role of the PTC1 oncogene in human papillary thyroid carcinoma is further supported by the fact that our transgenic mouse model with targeted expression of the PTC1 oncogene in the thyroid gland develops papillary thyroid carcinomas (17Jhiang S.M. Sagartz J.E. Tong Q. Parker-Thornburg J. Capen C.C. Cho J.-Y. Xing S. Ledent C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 375-378Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of PTC1 activation in the development of papillary thyroid tumors has yet to be elucidated. We have previously demonstrated that the PTC1 chimeric oncogene shows unscheduled expression in the thyroid follicular cells and that recombinant proteins containing the putative leucine zipper domain of H4 form oligomeric complexes in vitro (18Tong Q. Li Y. Smanik P.A. Fithian L. Xing S. Mazzaferri E.L. Jhiang S.M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1781-1787Google Scholar). As dimerization is considered to be a crucial step for receptor tyrosine kinase activation (19Honegger A.M. Schmidt A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4035-4044Google Scholar, 20Ullrich A. Schlessinger Y. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar), we hypothesized that both unscheduled expression of RET tyrosine kinase and constitutive oligomerization of PTC1 proteins are responsible for PTC1-transforming activity in the thyroid. In this study, we further demonstrated that the leucine zipper region of H4 is responsible for the dimerization of the PTC1 oncoprotein in vivo Our data also indicated that the leucine zipper-mediated dimerization is essential for tyrosine hyperphosphorylation and the transforming activity of PTC1. Furthermore, the transforming activity of PTC1 can be suppressed by introducing a loss-of-function mutant of PTC1 into PTC1-transformed NIH3T3 cells. The African green monkey kidney cell line, COS-7 cells (ATCC 1651), was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Both NIH3T3 and NIH3T3/PTC1 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% donor calf serum. All media contain 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The monoclonal antibody MSJ was generated in our laboratory. Its epitope was tentatively mapped to amino acid residues 824-828 of RET. 1Q. Tong, S. Xing, and S. M. Jhiang, unpublished data. The polyclonal antibody, C17, was raised against a synthetic peptide (CKRRDYLDLAASTPSDSL) located at amino acid residues 1011-1027 of the C terminus of the RET tyrosine kinase (Immuno-Dynamics, Inc.). The C17 antibody was purified through an affinity column covalently bound with the synthetic peptide. The monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. The PTC1/CMV was constructed by excising the PTC1 cDNA from the plasmid TPC-1 (15Ishizaka Y. Shima H. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1441-1444Google Scholar) and inserting it into the XbaI and ApaI sites of pRc/CMV (Invitrogen). The PTC1/LNCX was obtained by excising the PTC1 fragment from PTC1/CMV with HindIII and inserting it into the HindIII site of pLNCX. To clone PTC1Δzip/CMV and PTC1Δzip/LNCX, the T7 primer and another primer (5′-AACGGAACGGCGAGATGA-3′), which is located to a region just ahead of the leucine zipper, were used to perform polymerase chain reaction using PTC1/CMV as DNA template. The 250-base pair polymerase chain reaction product was digested with BamHI and used to replace the 400-base pair BamHI fragment of H4 in PTC1/CMV and PTC1/LNCX. To clone PTC1ΔN/CMV and PTC1ΔN/LNCX, a sense primer (5′-TATGCCATGGCGCCGTTCCGCCTG-3′), which is located at the beginning of the leucine zipper region, was paired with an antisense primer (5′-AGTTCTTCCGAGGGAATTCC-3′), which is located at the beginning of the RET tyrosine kinase domain, to perform polymerase chain reaction on the PTC1/CMV template. A 200-base pair BamHI fragment was excised from the polymerase chain reaction product and used to replace the 400-base pair H4 fragment of PTC1/CMV and PTC1/LNCX. The PTC1ΔC/CMV was generated by unidirectional deletion of the PTC1 insert, starting from the C terminus of PTC1. A mutation (Arg897→ Glu), found in some patients with Hirschsprung's disease (13Romeo G. Ronchetto P. Luo Y. Barone V. Seri M. Ceccherini I. Pasini B. Bocciardi R. Lerone M. Kaariainen H. Martucciello G. Nature. 1994; 367: 377-378Google Scholar), was first introduced into c-RET cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis (Muta-gene M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit, Bio-Rad) and later subcloned into PTC1/CMV and PTC1Δzip/CMV to obtain PTC1HS/CMV and PTC1ΔzipHS/CMV. For transient transfection, 5 × 105 COS-7 cells were transfected with 10-20 μg of various DNA constructs using the calcium phosphate transfection kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). For the focus formation assay, 1.3 × 105 NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 0.3 μg of various DNA constructs. Three weeks later, the foci were stained with Giemsa and counted. For NIH3T3 stable transfectants, 4 × 104 NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 1 μg of various DNA constructs, and the G418-resistant colonies were screened for PTC1 expression by immunoprecipitating the cell lysates with the antibody C17, followed by immunoblot analysis with the antibody MSJ. Cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mM Na3VO4. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated at 4°C overnight with C17 polyclonal antibody that was covalently conjugated to protein A beads (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). For the immunoblot assay, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE 2The abbreviation used is: PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in TBST buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk at 4°C overnight. After incubation with the primary antibody for 1 h and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Transduction Laboratories) for an additional hour, the membrane was treated with ECL reagent (Amersham Corp.) and exposed to x-ray film. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Cross-linking was carried out at room temperature with 0.01% glutaraldehyde in 50 mM triethanolamine (pH 8.2) and 100 mM NaCl, using 20-50 μl of lysate of COS-7 cells transfected with various DNA constructs. Aliquots were removed at the times indicated, and the reaction was terminated by boiling the mixture in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The sample was resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblot with the anti-RET antibody MSJ. The soft agar assay was carried out as follows. A bottom layer of agar was prepared in 60-mm Petri dishes using 3 ml of 0.5% noble agar (Difco) in normal growth medium. Next, 3 ml of 0.35% noble agar in normal growth medium containing 9 × 103 cells were added on top of the solidified bottom layer. Colonies with anchorage-independent growth were counted 2 weeks later. To investigate the oligomerization status of PTC1 oncoprotein in eukaryotic cells, the PTC1 oncoprotein was expressed in COS-7 cells by transient transfection with a DNA construct PTC1/CMV. The lysates of COS-7 transfectants expressing PTC1 were treated with glutaraldehyde to stabilize the oligomeric protein complexes (Fig. 1b). Without cross-linking treatment, PTC1 oncoprotein can be detected at the size of 53 kDa, since the PTC1 used in our experiment is the alternative spliced isoform with a shorter C terminus (6Tahira T. Ishizaka Y. Itoh F. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 97-102Google Scholar). After 1 min of treatment with glutaraldehyde, a 105-kDa protein complex can be readily detected. By 16 min, the PTC1 monomer can no longer be detected. We consistently observed that the PTC1 protein complexes had a stronger signal intensity than the PTC1 monomers in immunoblot detection. One possible explanation is that the formation of protein complexes may alter the conformation of the RET tyrosine kinase for better binding of the MSJ antibody to the epitope site. To investigate the role of the leucine zipper of H4 in the formation of PTC1 protein complexes, two forms of PTC1 mutant, PTC1Δzip and PTC1ΔN, were constructed. PTC1Δzip had the leucine zipper region of H4 (amino acid residues 56-102) deleted. PTC1ΔN had the N terminus of H4 (amino acid residues 3-52) deleted but retained the leucine zipper (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1b, the PTC1Δzip (46 kDa) fails to form protein complexes even after a 16-min treatment with glutaraldehyde. In contrast, PTC1ΔN (49 kDa) retains the ability to form protein complexes. These data indicate that the formation of PTC1 protein complex is mediated by the leucine zipper of H4. A co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed to further investigate whether the PTC1 forms homodimers. A mutated form of PTC1, PTC1ΔC, had the extreme C terminus of PTC1 (amino acid residues 345-461) deleted. Therefore, PTC1ΔC is no longer recognized by the polyclonal antibody C17 (Fig. 2a). When the PTC1ΔC was co-expressed in COS-7 cells with either PTC1, PTC1Δzip, or PTC1ΔN, the PTC1ΔC-encoded protein cannot be immunoprecipitated by C17 unless it forms protein complexes with other forms of PTC1 containing an intact C terminus. The expression of PTC1 and its mutants in various cell lysates is detected by the MSJ monoclonal antibody, which can react with all forms of PTC1 protein including PTC1ΔC (Fig. 2b). The PTC1ΔC product (38 kDa) cannot be immunoprecipitated by C17 when it was expressed alone or co-expressed with PTC1Δzip (Fig. 2c, lanes 2 and 4), but can be co-immunoprecipitated when it was co-expressed with PTC1 or PTC1ΔN (Fig. 2c, lanes 3 and 5). From the results of the cross-linking experiment and the co-immunoprecipitation assay we conclude that PTC1 oncoprotein forms a homodimer in vivo, and the dimerization is mediated by the leucine zipper domain of H4. It has been shown that dimerization of receptor tyrosine kinases promotes the transphosphorylation of tyrosine residues on intracellular domains (20Ullrich A. Schlessinger Y. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Google Scholar). To investigate whether there is a correlation between dimerization and transphosphorylation, the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of PTC1, PTC1Δzip, and PTC1ΔN proteins expressed in COS-7 cells were examined (Fig. 3). The equivalent amount of PTC1, PTC1Δzip, and PTC1ΔN proteins used in the immunoblot analysis was also shown. The PTC1 and PTC1ΔN oncoprotein are hyperphosphorylated on tyrosine residues. However, deletion of the leucine zipper region of PTC1 dramatically reduced the tyrosine phosphorylation level of the PTC1Δzip-encoded protein. To correlate the leucine zipper-mediated dimerization and tyrosine hyperphosphorylation with the transforming activity of PTC1, both focus formation assay and soft agar assay were performed to evaluate the transforming activity of PTC1, PTC1Δzip, or PTC1ΔN. The expression of PTC1, PTC1Δzip, or PTC1ΔN proteins encoded by the corresponding DNA constructs was initially confirmed by transient transfection in COS-7 cells, and the expression levels of these three proteins did not appear to be different in COS-7 cells. For focus formation assay, NIH3T3 fibroblast cells were transfected with PTC1/LNCX, PTC1Δzip/LNCX, or PTC1ΔN/LNCX DNA constructs. The transfected NIH3T3 cells were either left in the plates for 3 weeks to score for the number of foci formed (loss of contact inhibition) or were under G418 selection to monitor the transfection efficiency. As shown in Table I, although all DNA constructs showed equivalent transfection efficiency, NIH3T3 cells transfected with PTC1/LNCX or PTC1ΔN/LNCX, but not with PTC1Δzip/LNCX or vector DNA, lost contact inhibition and displayed the ability to form foci.TABLE IFocus formation assay to compare the transforming activity of PTC1, PTC1Δzip, and PTC1ΔN in NIH3T3 cellsDNA constructFoci/pmolG418R colonies/pmolpLNCX<15.7 × 102PTC15.4 × 1026.0 × 102PTC1Δzip<15.7 × 102PTC1ΔN4.0 × 1025.5 × 102 Open table in a new tab For soft agar assay, NIH3T3 stable transfectants expressing PTC1, PTC1Δzip, or PTC1ΔN were established. We consistently observed that the protein expression levels of PTC1 or PTC1ΔN were higher than those of PTC1Δzip in corresponding NIH3T3 stable transfectants (Fig. 4). The clones expressing the lowest amount of PTC1 (PTC1-5 and PTC1-10), a clone expressing the highest amount of PTC1Δzip (PTC1Δzip-3), and clones expressing both high (PTC1ΔN-2) and low (PTC1ΔN-1) amounts of PTC1ΔN were selected for soft agar assay. The result of soft agar assay demonstrated that NIH3T3 cells expressing PTC1 or PTC1ΔN, but not PTC1Δzip, acquired anchorage-independent growth in soft agar (Table II).TABLE IISoft agar assay to compare the transforming activity of PTC1, PTC1Δzip, and PTC1ΔN in NIH3T3 stable transfectantsCell lineNumber of coloniesNIH3T30PTC1-5255 ± 30PTC1-10228 ± 6PTC1Δzip-30PTC1ΔN-144 ± 6PTC1ΔN-250 ± 16 Open table in a new tab Although no difference in the ability to form foci was observed between cells expressing PTC1 and cells expressing PTC1ΔN (Table I), fewer colonies were formed in soft agar for PTC1ΔN-expressing cells compared with PTC1-expressing cells (Table II). Even though two different clones of both PTC1 and PTC1ΔN were tested by soft agar assay, the clonal effect cannot be completely excluded. Alternatively, the N-terminal region of H4 may contain some elements contributing to the anchorage-independent growth of PTC1 but not to the loss of contact inhibition. Taken together, the results of focus formation assay and soft agar assay indicate that the leucine zipper-mediated dimerization is required for the PTC1 transforming activity. Since intermolecular phosphorylation of dimerized receptor tyrosine kinases is crucial for the PTC1 activation, it is possible to suppress the PTC1 transforming activity by introducing a loss-of-function PTC1 mutant to form inactive heterodimers with PTC1. A mutation at codon 897 of c-RET, changing arginine to glutamine, was identified in some patients with Hirschsprung's disease (13Romeo G. Ronchetto P. Luo Y. Barone V. Seri M. Ceccherini I. Pasini B. Bocciardi R. Lerone M. Kaariainen H. Martucciello G. Nature. 1994; 367: 377-378Google Scholar). This mutant has been characterized as a loss-of-function mutation (22Pasini B. Borrello M.G. Greco A. Bongarzone I. Luo Y. Mondellini P. Alberti L. Miranda C. Arighi E. Bocciardi R. Seri M. Barone V. Radice M.T. Romeo G. Pierotti M.A. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 35-40Google Scholar). PTC1HS, a PTC1 mutant containing this mutation, was transfected into the NIH3T3/PTC1 cells, which were established by transfecting NIH3T3 cells with human thyroid tumor genomic DNA that contains the naturally occurring PTC1 transforming gene (1Grieco M. Santoro M. Berlingieri M.T. Melillo R.M. Donghi R. Bongarzone I. Pierotti M.A. Della Porta G. Fusco A. Veccio G. Cell. 1990; 60: 557-563Google Scholar). Since the NIH3T3/PTC1 cells do not have G418 resistance, NIH3T3/PTC1 cells transfected with various DNA constructs can be selected by G418, and the transformed phenotype of the G418-resistant colonies was evaluated by their ability to form foci. As shown in Fig. 5, approximately 68.6% of the mock transfected (pRc/CMV vector only) NIH3T3/PTC1 cells and 52.5% of the PTC1ΔzipHS/CMV-transfected NIH3T3/PTC1 cells retained the ability to form foci. When analyzed by Student's t test, there was no significant difference between the effects of PTC1ΔzipHS and mock transfection. However, only 18.5% of PTC1HS/CMV-transfected NIH3T3/PTC1 cells maintained transformed phenotype, which was significantly different from that of NIH3T3/PTC1 cells transfected with pRc/CMV vector (p < 0.001) or cells transfected with PTC1ΔzipHS/CMV (p < 0.05). In this study, we demonstrated that the PTC1 oncoprotein forms dimers in vivo and the dimerization of PTC1 is mediated by the leucine zipper in the H4 portion of PTC1. Our data also indicated that the leucine zipper-mediated dimerization was essential for the constitutive phosphorylation and the transforming activity of the PTC1 oncoprotein. Furthermore, a loss-of-function PTC1 mutant can reverse the transformed phenotype of NIH3T3/PTC1 cells, presumably by forming inactive heterodimers. The PTC1 oncoprotein, with the extracellular and transmembrane domains of c-RET replaced by H4, is localized in the cytoplasm (15Ishizaka Y. Shima H. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1441-1444Google Scholar) instead of the plasma membrane of cells. It was proposed that the translocation of PTC1 from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm could have provided the structural basis for its escape from the modulatory effect of the membrane-associated protein kinase C (23Lanzi C. Borrello M.G. Bongarzone I. Migliazza A. Fusco A. Grieco M. Santoro M. Gambetta R.A. Zunino F. Della Porta G. Pierotti M.A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2189-2194Google Scholar). However, our data indicate that loss of membrane localization is not enough for the activation of the RET tyrosine kinase, since PTC1Δzip, which is also localized in the cytoplasm, lost both tyrosine hyperphosphorylation and transforming activity. Our data indicated that the leucine zipper-mediated dimerization is required for the activation of PTC1 tyrosine kinase. In human papillary thyroid carcinomas, three different forms of the PTC oncogenes have been identified in which the RET tyrosine kinase domain becomes fused with the N-terminal sequences of three different genes (1Grieco M. Santoro M. Berlingieri M.T. Melillo R.M. Donghi R. Bongarzone I. Pierotti M.A. Della Porta G. Fusco A. Veccio G. Cell. 1990; 60: 557-563Google Scholar, 24Bongarzone I. Monzini N. Borrello M.G.

In addition to PTC1, the PTC2 oncoprotein has also been shown to form dimers in vivo (24Bongarzone I. Monzini N. Borrello M.G. Carcano C. Ferraresi G. Areghi E. Mondellini P. Della Porta G. Pierotti M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 358-366Google Scholar), and the dimerization is required for the mitogenic activity of PTC2 (27Durick K. Yao V.J. Borrello M.G. Bongarzone I. Pierotti M.A. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24642-24645Google Scholar). Although PTC3 has not been shown to form oligomers experimentally, a potential coiled-coil motif was identified in the ELE1 sequence of PTC3.1 In addition to PTC oncogenes, RETI and RETII transforming genes, which were formed by rearrangements during in vitro transfection (28Takahashi M. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1378-1385Google Scholar, 29Ishizaka Y. Tahira T. Ochiai M. Ikeda I. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene Res. 1988; 3: 193-197Google Scholar), also form dimers in vivo (30Cao T. Etkin L.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 19 (Abstr. A1-306): 48Google Scholar).1 Therefore, constitutive oligomerization of RET appears to be a common mechanism for the activation of rearranged RET oncoproteins. In fact, constitutive oligomerization may serve as a common mechanism for oncogenic activation of other receptor tyrosine kinases in thyroid tumors. The TPR protein, which is involved in a rearrangement with the tyrosine kinase domain of the TRK nerve growth factor receptor in human papillary thyroid carcinoma (31Greco A. Pierotti M.A. Bongarzone I. Pagliardini S. Lanzi C. Della Porta G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 237-242Google Scholar), contains a leucine zipper domain and forms dimers in vivo (32Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6711-6722Google Scholar). All of the tyrosine kinase oncogenes formed by rearrangement in human papillary carcinomas seem to be activated by constitutive oligomerization. Rodrigues and Park (32Rodrigues G.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6711-6722Google Scholar) have proposed that oligomerization may serve as a general mechanism for oncogenic activation of receptor tyrosine kinases in many types of tumors. They demonstrated that the leucine zipper domain in TPR mediates dimerization of the TPR-MET oncoprotein, and this constitutive dimerization is essential for its transforming activity. Not only can rearrangement cause oligomerization to activate receptor tyrosine kinases, but point mutations have also been shown to promote constitutive dimerization of receptor tyrosine kinases. Point mutations of RET found in MEN2A patients, resulting in the substitution of one of five Cys residues in the extracellular domain, caused constitutive dimerization and activation of RET tyrosine kinase (33Santoro M. Carlomagno F. Romano A. Bottaro D.P. Dathan N.A. Grieco M. Fusco A. Veccio G. Matoskova B. Kraus M.H. Di Fiore P.P. Science. 1995; 267: 381-383Google Scholar, 34Xing S. Smanik P.A. Oglesbee M.J. Trosko J.E. Mazzaferri E.L. Jhiang S.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1512-1519Google Scholar). An amino acid substitution of the NEU oncogene has also been shown to induce oncoprotein aggregation, and increase tyrosine kinase activity and transforming activity (35Weiner D.B. Liu J. Cohen J.A. Williams W.V. Greene M.I. Nature. 1989; 239: 230-231Google Scholar). Therefore, the approach of using a loss-of-function mutant to suppress the transforming activity of the corresponding oncogene provides a new strategy to specifically intervene with the oncogenic activity of various receptor tyrosine kinase oncogenes in a variety of tumors.

C., Bektas, M., Wieder, Th., and Orfanos, C. E. (1996) FEBS Lett. 378, 88–92). In the present paper, the mechanism underlying the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on sphingomyelin hydrolysis was investigated. Using the cell culture supernatant of HaCaT cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 2 h, it was possible to induce sphingomyelin hydrolysis as early as 30–60 min after addition to resting cells. Several lines of experimental evidence indicated that tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) mediates sphingomyelin hydrolysis after 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment: (i) 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulated TNFα mRNA expression after 1 h, (ii) newly synthesized TNFα occurred 2 h after 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment, (iii) indirect activation of sphingomyelin hydrolysis by the supernatant of 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated HaCaT cells was abolished by preincubation of the supernatant with antibodies directed against TNFα, and (iv) preincubation of HaCaT cells with neutralizing antibodies directed against the 55-kDa receptor of TNFα blocked the ability of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to induce sphingomyelin hydrolysis in HaCaT cells. These data demonstrate that 1,25-(OH)2D3 activated sphingomyelin hydrolysis by an autocrine mechanism via TNFα expression. Furthermore, this indirect mode of action may serve as an explanation for the delayed induction of sphingomyelin hydrolysis by vitamin D3.

Significant activation of SAPK/JNK was achieved in heart, liver, and kidney at 60 or 90 min of heat stress.

Despite extensive sequence homologies, the two isoforms bound to F2 with different affinities and ratios of homodimer/monomer. Using F2-containing reporter gene, we found that the transcriptional activity of TRβ1 was ∼6-fold higher than that of TRα1.

Alternate splicings of their primary transcripts produce isoforms of the protein (α1, α2, β1, and β2), which regulate the transcription of their target genes by binding to specific DNA sequences, known as thyroid hormone response elements (TREs). These contain repeats of a half-site binding motif with the sequence AGGTCA. Naturally occurring TREs can include these sequences as adjacent palindromic repeats, as direct repeats separated by 4 nucleotides, and as everted repeats separated by 6 nucleotides (F2) (1Cheng S.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1995; 2: 77-89Google Scholar, 2Oppenheimer J.H. Schwartz H.J. Strait K.A. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 130: 15-24Google Scholar). The sequences of TRs have been divided into four separate domains, A/B, C, D, and E. Domain C contains two zinc fingers and is involved in binding of the receptors to TREs. Domains D and E are structurally linked, in so far as part of domain D is required for the biological function of domain E, which is to bind thyroid hormones (3Lin K.-H. Parkison C. McPhie P. Cheng S.-Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 485-492Google Scholar). Domains D and E are also involved in binding to co-repressors and dimerization, respectively (4Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

Despite this high sequence homology, biochemical evidence suggests that they could have isoform-specific roles in mediating the action of thyroid hormones. TRα and β genes are expressed at different stages during embryonic development (7Rodd C. Schwartz H.L. Strait K.A. Oppenheimer J.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 2559-2564Google Scholar, 8Strait K.A.

More direct evidence to support the isoform-specific functional role of the TRα1 and TRβ1 was provided by using gene transfer experiments. Strait et al. (11Strait K.A. Zou L. Oppenheimer J.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1874-1880Google Scholar) showed that the gene encoding PCP-2 is regulated by TRβ1 but not by TRα1. The 3,3′,5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3)-dependent negative regulation of thyroid tropin releasing hormone promoter was shown to be mediated by TRβ1 but not by TRα1 (12Lezoualc'h F. Hassan A.H. Giraud P. Loeffler J.P. Lee S.L. Demeneix B.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1797-1804Google Scholar). Recently, using stably transfected neuronal cell line, Lebel et al. (13Lebel J.M. Dussault J.H. Puymirat J.

At present, the molecular basis of isoform-specific gene regulation is not understood. It was suggested that the different homodimerization potentials of the two isoforms may underlie the functional differences. TRβ1 is known to bind to F2 and the TRE site on cardiac β-myosin heavy chain mainly as a homodimer, whereas TRα1 forms homodimer poorly (14Yen P.M. Sugawara A. Chin W.W. J. Biol.

These differences, however, are not eliminated by removal of A/B domains from the molecules (16Zhu X.-G. Yu C.-L. McPhie P. Wong R. Cheng S.-Y Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 712-721Google Scholar) and consequently must arise from the remainder of the receptors. However, it is not clear that they are a consequence only of differences in sequence. They may also be caused by changes in interactions between domains in the intact receptors. Because of their marked effects on the properties of the receptors as transcription factors, we have investigated their origins by construction of a series of six chimeric receptors, in which domains A/B/C, D, and E from the two isoforms are joined in all possible combinations. We have measured their affinities for T3 under identical conditions and their binding to an F2 TRE. We also determined the T3-dependent transcriptional activity of the wild type and chimeric receptors. We found that the domains C, D, and E are functionally linked, and the differential transcriptional activity of the two isoforms is mediated by interplay of their domains. Dulbecco's modified essential medium was purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum and lipofectamine transfection reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. [α-32P]dCTP was obtained from Amersham Life Sciences, Inc. [14C]Chloramphenicol and [3′-125I]T3 ([125I]T3) were purchased from DuPont NEN. TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation kits were from Promega (Madison, WI). The T7-expression plasmids of the six chimeric receptors (see Fig. 2) were derived from the T7 expression plasmids of w-TRα1 (pLC13) (17Lin K.-H. Lin Y.-W. Parkison C. Cheng S.-Y Cancer Lett. 1994; 85: 189-194Google Scholar) and w-TRβ1 (pCJ3) (18Lin K.-H. Fukuda T. Cheng S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5161-5165Google Scholar). For cloning purpose, two restriction enzyme sites, NsiI and BamHI, were introduced into the boundaries between domains C and D and domains D and E of w-TRα1 (nucleotide positions 412-414 (AAG/Lys to AAA/Lys) and 616-621 (GGCAGC/Gly-Ser to GGATCC/Gly-Ser)) to yield a new T7 expression plasmid of w-TRα1, pCHα. Only one restriction site, BamHI, was required to introduce into the boundary between domains D and E of w-TRβ1 (nucleotide positions 991-996 (GGCAGC/Gly-Ser to GGATCC/Gly-Ser)) because in pCJ3 (w-TRβ1) the NsiI already existed which yielded a new T7 expression plasmid of w-TRβ1, pCHβ. The introduction of these restriction sites was carried out by in vitro mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The introduction of these two new restriction sites into TRα1 and the BamHI site into TRβ1 did not change the amino acid sequences of TR isoform proteins. The six chimeric receptors were constructed by exchanging the domains between w-TRα1 and w-TRβ1 using NsiI, BamHI, and the 3′ EcoRI site immediately downstream of the termination codons of w-TRα1 (nucleotide position 1306 for TRα1 and 1672 for TRβ1 (pCJ3)) to yield T7 expression plasmids pCH1, pCH2, pCH3, pCH4, pCH5, and pCH6 for βαβ, ββα, βαα, ααβ, αβα, and αββ, respectively (see Fig. 2). The coding sequences for the six chimeric receptors were verified by restriction map analyses and direct DNA sequencing. The mammalian expression plasmids of the TRα1 and TRβ1 chimeric receptors were derived from the corresponding w-TRα1 and w-TRβ1 expression plasmids, pCLC61 and pCLC51 (19Lin K.-H. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9277-9281Google Scholar), respectively. The expression of w-TRα1 and w-TRβ1 is driven by cytomegalovirus promoter. To prepare the mammalian expression plasmids of chimeric receptor of TRβ1, pCLC51 was restricted by NotI followed by filling in with Klenow in the presence of deoxynucleotides. The coding sequence of the w-TRβ1 in pCLC51 was then released by treating the linearized and blunt-ended pCLC51 with HindIII, thereby providing the vector for ligation to the proper chimeric TR coding fragments. The wild type and chimeric TRβ1 coding fragments were derived from the above T7 expression plasmids (pCHβ, pCH1, pCH2, and pCH3) by treating the plasmids with EcoRI. After filling in, the fragments were released by treating with NdeI. An adaptor (HindIII/NdeI) was used in the final ligation of TR coding fragments to the vectors to yield plasmids pCDMCHβ, pCDMCH1, pCDMCH2, and pCDMCH3 for W-TRβ1, βαβ, ββα and βαα, respectively. The mammalian expression plasmids of w-TRα1 and its chimeric receptors were prepared similarly except that the vector was derived from pCLC61. The resulting mammalian plasmids were pCDMCHα, pCDMCH4, pCDMCH5, and pCDMCH6 for w-TRα1, ααβ, αβα, and αββ, respectively. The probe, F2, was 32P-labeled similarly as described (20Meier C.A. Parkison C. Chen A. Ashizawa K. Muchmore P. Meier-Heusler S.C. Cheng S.-Y. Weintraub B.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1986-1993Google Scholar). Briefly, two complementary oligonucleotides containing the F2 sequences as shown in Sequence 1 below,were annealed and the recess 3′-end filled with DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The labeled oligonucleotides were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and purified by electroelution. For EMSA, unlabeled TRs synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation were used. The synthesized receptor proteins were quantified by measuring the intensity of the 35S-labeled protein bands after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, CA). The 35S-labeled protein was synthesized concurrently by using amino acid mixture minus methionine but with [35S]methionine (4 μl; 1190 Ci/mmol). Based on the quantitation of the labeled receptors, the amounts of the unlabeled receptors were calculated. For the determination of the binding constants of TRs to F2, equal amounts of the in vitro translated unlabeled receptors were incubated with increasing concentrations of the labeled probes (0.2-120 fmol) in the binding buffer (25 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 0.11 M NaCl, and 0.4 μg of single-stranded DNA). In some experiments, RXRβ prepared as described by Meier et al (20Meier C.A. Parkison C. Chen A. Ashizawa K. Muchmore P. Meier-Heusler S.C. Cheng S.-Y. Weintraub B.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1986-1993Google Scholar) was added. After incubation for 30 min at 25°C, the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 4°C for 2-3 h at a constant voltage of 250 V. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. The intensities of retarded bands and free probes were quantified by PhosphorImager. The binding data were analyzed based on the equations and considerations as described below. Binding of glucocorticoid nuclear receptors to response elements with adjacent identical half-sites has been successfully analyzed using a simple two-site cooperative model, which ignored dimerization of free receptors in solution (21Lundback T. Cairns C. Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. Hard T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5074-5082Google Scholar). Since dimerization of unbound TR's has never been detected, we interpret our results in a similar way (Equation 1). Receptor (R) can bind to either TRE half-site (D) to give monomeric complexes (DR and RD) or to both yielding a dimeric complex (RDR). We assume that a receptor molecule can bind to either half-site on an empty TRE (D) with a binding constant K1 and on a monomeric complex (DR or RD) with a binding constant K2. If K2 = s·K2, then s is the cooperativity parameter. Positive cooperativity implies s > 1, i.e. stronger binding of the second TR than the first to the TRE. The concentration of monomeric complexes [monomer]=[DR]+[RD]=2⋅K1⋅[R]⋅[D](Eq. 2) and of dimeric complexes [ dimer ]=K2⋅[D]⋅[RD]=K1⋅K2⋅[D]⋅[R]2(Eq. 3) The total concentration of TRE, [D]0=[D]+[DR]+[RD]+[RDR]=[D]⋅1+2⋅K1⋅[R]+K1⋅K2⋅[R]2(Eq. 4) Consequently [monomer]=2⋅K1[R]⋅[D]01+2⋅K1⋅[R]+K1⋅K2⋅[R]2(Eq. 5) [dimer]=K1⋅K2⋅[D]0⋅[R]21+2⋅K1⋅[R]+K1⋅K2⋅[R]2(Eq. 6) The concentrations of monomer, dimer, and TRE are measured on the gel from the known specific activities of the DNA probes. However, the recombinant TRs are produced in cell lysates. It was not possible to determine how much of the protein in each lysate was intact, competent TR, i.e. [R] is unknown. In each experiment, in each lane, we can measure a ratio, r=[ dimer ][ monomer ]=K1⋅K2⋅[D]0⋅[R]22⋅K1⋅[R]⋅[D]0=K2⋅[R]2(Eq. 7) so [R]=2⋅rK2(Eq. 8) Substituting Equation 8 into 5 and 6 gives [monomer]=4⋅K1⋅[D]0⋅rK2+4⋅K1⋅r+4⋅K1⋅r2(Eq. 9) [dimer]=4⋅K1⋅[D]0⋅r2K2+4⋅K1⋅r+4⋅K1⋅r2(Eq. 10) For each combination of recombinant TR and TRE, values of K1 and K2 were estimated by fitting the measured concentrations [monomer] and [dimer] simultaneously to Equations 9 and 10 as functions of [D]0 and r, with the constraints K1 > 0, K2 > 0. Analyses were performed using the PC-MLAB program (Civilized Software, Bethesda, MD). It must be pointed out that this procedure violates one basic assumption of least squares curve fitting, i.e. that experimental uncertainties in plotted data parallel the y axis (22Johnson M.L. Brand L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 232: 240-256Google Scholar). Here we have uncertainties along both axes. Together with the problems of the gel retardation method, which requires separation of reactants and products, perturbing the system from equilibrium, as discussed previously (16Zhu X.-G. Yu C.-L. McPhie P. Wong R. Cheng S.-Y Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 712-721Google Scholar), could result in some uncertainty in K1 and K2. Consequently, the values given in Table I may be only approximate.TABLE IApparent affinity constants of the binding of w-TRβ1, w-TRα1, and chimeric receptors to F2TRsF2, Ka (× 106M−1)K1k2sw-TRβ1 (βββ)0.14004000βαβ0.35001667ββα0.45001250βαα2400200w-TRα1 (ααα)3300100ααβ3300100αβα3300100αββ420050 Open table in a new tab The binding was carried out by incubating the in vitro translated TR proteins with 0.4 nM [125I]T3 in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled T3 (0.1 to 10 nM) in 0.25 ml of buffer B (50 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.01% Lubrol, and 20% glycerol) for 90 min at 25°C. TR-bound [125I]T3 was separated from the unbound radioligand in a Sephadex G-25 (fine) column (5.5 × 1 cm), as described (3Lin K.-H. Parkison C. McPhie P. Cheng S.-Y. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 485-492Google Scholar). The binding data were analyzed by using Equation 11 based on direct competition between [125I]T3 and the unlabeled T3 for a single site on the receptor. The concentration of radioactive complex is given by Equation 11: [Rh]=[R]0+[h]Kd+[h]+[c](Eq. 11) where [R]0 is the total concentration of receptor, [h] and [c] are the concentrations of [125I]T3 and the unlabeled T3, respectively, and Kd is the dissociation constant of the hormone-receptor complex. The data were fitted directly to Equation 11 using the PC-MLAB program (Civilized Software, Bethesda, MD), to evaluate Kd and [R]0. CV1 cells (4 × 105 cells/60-mm dish) were plated 24 h before transfection in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with appropriate expression plasmids (0.2 μg) for w-TRβ1 (pCDMCHβ), w-TRα1 (pCDMCHα), or the chimeric receptors (pCDMCH1, pCDMCH2, pCDMCH3, pCDMCH4, pCDMCH5, and pCDMCH6), TRE-containing TK-CAT reporter plasmid (0.2 μg), and pCH110 (0.2 μg; an expression plasmid for β-galactosidase) by using the lipofectamine transfection method according to the manufacturer's procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.). pBluescript SK II (+) Strategene, La Jolla, CA) was used to bring the total DNA transfected to 3 μg. After 6 h, the medium was replaced by fresh Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 10% thyroid hormone-depleted serum. Fifteen hours before cells were harvested, T3 (100 nM) was added to the appropriate dishes. After an additional 18 h, cells were lysed and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity was determined as described previously (23Lin K.-H. Ashizawam K. Cheng S.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7737-7741Google Scholar, 24Bhat M.K. Ashizawa K. Cheng S.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7927-7931Google Scholar). CAT activity was normalized by using equal amounts of lysate proteins. Cultured CV-1 cells were transfected as described above. Two days later, cells were processed for immunofluorescence studies as described previously (25Lin K.-H. Willingham M.C. Liang C.-M. Cheng S.-Y. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2601-2609Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at 25°C. After washing, cells were incubated with monoclonal antibody C4 (10 μg/ml; 26) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% saponin and 4 mg/ml normal goat globulin for 30 min at 25°C. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with affinity-purified goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated with rhodamine (25 μg/ml) for 30 min at 25°C. Cells were viewed and photographed using microscope equipped with rhodamine epifluorescence optics. Cell lysates (25 μg) from transient transfection experiments as described above were loaded onto a 10% SDS gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (PH79 membrane; Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was gently shaken in 5% non-fat milk in TBS (25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) for 20 h and was subsequently washed three times with TBS. The membrane was incubated with monoclonal antibody C4 (1 μg/ml) for 1 h. After washing, the membrane was incubated with affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:1,000 dilution). TR protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using ECL kit (Amersham Life Sciences, Inc.). Previously it has been shown that TRβ1 binds to F2 mainly as a homodimer, whereas TRα1 binds to F2 both as a homodimer and as a monomer (14Yen P.M. Sugawara A. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23248-23252Google Scholar, 15Darling D.S. Carter R.L. Yen P.M. Welborn J.M. Chin W.W. Umeda P.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10221-10227Google Scholar). However, there was no quantitative comparison in the differential binding of F2 to the two isoforms. We therefore compared the binding affinities of F2 to the two isoforms. Fig. 1 shows the binding of TRα1 and TRβ1 to F2 in a concentration-dependent manner. Consistent with previous observations (14Yen P.M. Sugawara A. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23248-23252Google Scholar, 16Zhu X.-G. Yu C.-L. McPhie P. Wong R. Cheng S.-Y Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 712-721Google Scholar), TRβ1 bound to F2 predominantly as a homodimer. Interestingly, when F2 concentration was higher than 15 fmol, weak binding of TRβ1 to F2 as a monomer was clearly detected (lanes 13-16). However, TRα1 bound to F2 differently from TRβ1. As shown in Fig. 1, at all corresponding F2 concentrations, TRα1 bound both as a homodimer and as a monomer. It clearly had a higher propensity to form monomer than TRβ1 (lanes 1 versus 9; lane 2 versus 10; lane 3 versus 11; lane 4 versus 12; lane 5 versus 13; lane 6 versus 14; lane 7 versus 15; and lane 8 versus 16). The binding data shown in Fig. 1 were analyzed, and the Ka values of homodimeric (K2) and monomeric (K1) binding for TRβ1 were found to be 400 and 0.1 × 106M−1, respectively, indicating an increase of 4000-fold in the binding affinity when TRβ1 was bound to F2 as a homodimer (s = 4000; Table I). Thus, binding of the first monomer of TRβ1 to F2 facilitated the binding of the second monomer. We designated “s” as the ratio of K2/K1 to measure the extent of positive cooperativity in the binding of TR to TREs. The Ka values of homodimeric and monomeric binding of TRα1 to F2 were 300 and 3 × 106M−1, respectively, which gave a substantially lower cooperativity (s = 100; see Table I) than that for TRβ1. To identify the molecular basis of the differential interaction of TRα1 and TRβ1 with F2, we interchanged the domains between the two isoforms and evaluated the effects of domain swapping on the F2 and T3 binding activity. An examination of the sequences between the two isoforms indicates that there is no sequence homology in the A/B domain, whereas there is an 88, 71, and 86% homology in sequence in domains C, D and E, respectively (Fig. 2I). We have previously shown that the removal of domain A/B has no effect on the interaction of TRβ1 with TREs (16Zhu X.-G. Yu C.-L. McPhie P. Wong R. Cheng S.-Y Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 712-721Google Scholar). Therefore, we grouped domain A/B together with domain C as a unit and constructed the chimeric receptors by swapping domains A/B/C, D, and E (Fig. 2II). The sequences encoding the chimeric receptors in the constructs were confirmed by restriction map analyses and DNA sequencing. To assess the T3 binding activity, we prepared the receptors by in vitro transcription/translation and carried out competitive T3 binding assays. The displacement curves for w-TRβ1 and its chimeric receptors are shown in Fig. 3A and for w-TRα1 and its chimeric receptors are shown in Fig. 3B Binding data were analyzed, and the Kd values are shown in Table II. The Kd values for the binding of w-TRβ1 and w-TRα1 to T3 were 0.36 ± 0.06 and 0.10 ± 0.037 nM, respectively, indicating that w-TRα1 bound to T3 with an approximately 3-fold higher affinity than that of w-TRβ1. The 3-fold difference is very significant as indicated by the t test (p < 0.01). The difference in the binding affinity was not due to the different protein expression level by the in vitro transcription/translation. As shown in Fig. 3C, lane 2 shows the two translation products of w-TRβ1 initiated from the ATGs (Met-5 and −32) with the molecular weights of ∼55,000 and ∼52,000 (26Bhat M.K. McPhie P. Ting Y.T. Zhu X.-G. Cheng S.-Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 30: 10591-10599Google Scholar, 27Weinberger C. Thompson C.C. Ong E.S. Lebo R. Gruol D.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 1986; 324: 641-646Google Scholar) that have the combined intensity similar to that of w-TRα1 shown in lane 6 (Fig. 3C). Similar binding experiments were carried out for the chimeric receptors, and as shown in Fig. 3, A and B, no significant differences were observed in the binding curves within the same subtype. The Kd values for the chimeric receptors are virtually identical to those of the wild type receptors (Table II), indicating that the domain swapping between the two isoforms had no effect on the T3 binding activity.TABLE IIApparent affinity constants of the binding of w-TRβ1, w-TRβ1, and chimeric receptors to F2TRsKdnMw-TRβ1 (βββ)0.36 ± 0.06βαβ0.33 ± 0.02ββα0.34 ± 0.08βαα0.34 ± 0.07w-TRα1 (ααα)0.10 ± 0.03ααβ0.14 ± 0.05αβα0.18 ± 0.04αββ0.14 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab In contrast to the T3 binding activity, domain swapping had a dramatic effect on the interaction of chimeric receptors with F2. Lanes 2-5 of Fig. 4 compare the binding of w-TRβ1 (βββ; see Fig. 2) and its chimeric receptors to F2 by EMSA. Replacement of domains D or E of TRβ1 by that of TRα1 had no significant effect on the binding of βαβ or ββα receptor to F2 as a homodimer, but an increase in the formation of monomer was seen (lanes 3 versus 2; lanes 4 versus 2). However, when both domains D and E were swapped, a dramatic increase in the monomer formation was detected. The extent of monomer formation was similar to that seen for w-TRα1 (ααα, lane 6 of Fig. 4A versus lane 5). We further measured an F2 concentration-dependent binding to each chimeric receptor (βαβ, ββα, and βαα), similar to the experiments shown in Fig. 1, and determined their affinity constants. The binding data were analyzed, and the Ka values are shown in Table I. Swapping of domain D or E of TRβ1 by that of TRα1 led to a 3- and 4-fold increase in the binding affinity of βαβ or ββα to F2 as a monomer, respectively (K1 = 0.3 and 0.4 × 106M−1, respectively, versus 0.1 × 106M−1 for w-TRβ1), but with little change in the binding affinity of these two chimeric receptors as a dimer (K2 = 500 × 106M−1). On the other hand, when both domains D and E were swapped, a dramatic 20-fold increase in monomer binding affinity (K1 = 2 × 106M−1) was detected. Thus, inclusion of domain D or E of TRα1 facilitates the binding of TR as a monomer. Lanes 7-9 of Fig. 4 show that replacement of either domain D or E alone or both domains D and E of TRα1 by the corresponding regions of TRβ1 resulted in a similar reduction in the monomer formation (lane 6 versus lanes 7-9). The ratios of monomer to homodimer were clearly reduced in ααβ, αβα, and αββ. A more detailed analysis was carried out by determining the affinities in the binding of F2 to the chimeric TRαs. Their K1, K2, and s values are shown in Table I which indicate that there were only small changes in the values of positive cooperativity in ααβ, αβα, and αββ as compared with ααα (s = 50-100). RXRs have been shown to heterodimerize with TRs and modulate the activity of TRs (1Cheng S.-Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1995; 2: 77-89Google Scholar, 2Oppenheimer J.H. Schwartz H.J. Strait K.A. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1994; 130: 15-24Google Scholar). We therefore also examined the effect of domain swapping on the heterodimerization activity of the chimeric receptors. Similar to w-TRβ1 and w-TRα1, all chimeric TRs were capable of forming dimers with RXRβ on F2. No significant differences in the extent of formation of heterodimers were detected among the chimeric TRs (data not shown). To assess the role of the domains in the transactivation activity of TRs, we constructed the mammalian expression vectors in which the expression of the wild type and chimeric TRs was driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. We co-transfected the TR expression plasmids with F2-containing reporter into CV1 cells. Fig. 5 shows that w-TRβ1 (βββ) had a ∼6-fold higher T3-dependent transactivation activity than w-TRα1 ("

We have investigated whether this interaction affects heparan sulfate catabolism in vitro by measuring the ability of partially purified CHO heparanase activities to degrade 35S-labeled heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans in the absence or presence of bFGF. Our studies show that the presence of the growth factor prevents partially purified heparanases from degrading the nascent 81-kDa chains to short 6-kDa products, whether the glycosaminoglycan is free in solution or covalently bound to core proteins. A 30-60 molar excess of the growth factor is required to inhibit completely chain degradation by heparanases, implying that multiple bFGF molecules must be bound to the glycosaminoglycan to prevent heparanase-catalyzed catabolism. This hypothesis is supported by protection studies indicating that nascent CHO heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans have at least four to eight bFGF binding sites/chain. It does not appear, however, that the growth factor inhibits heparanase-catalyzed degradation of the glycosaminoglycan by binding to the sequence cleaved by the enzyme. Both the nascent and short chains bind bFGF with similar affinity (Kd values of 27.0 ± 3.5 and 38.9 ± 5.1 nM, respectively), indicating that heparanase activities do not destroy the bFGF binding sites. Rather, our results suggest that the growth factor interferes sterically with heparanase action by binding the heparan sulfate chain at a sequence next to the cleavage site or at a secondary site recognized by the enzyme.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1116-1122Google Scholar). Proteoglycans are implicated in a number of cellular processes, including cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and proliferation (for review, see Refs. 7Wight T.N. Kinsella M.G. Qwarnstrom E.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 793-801Google Scholar and 8Rapraeger A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 844-853Google Scholar). Most of the identified proteoglycan functions are attributed to the interaction of the glycosaminoglycan chain with a protein ligand, such as lipoprotein lipase, fibronectin, or various members of heparin-binding growth factor family (9Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 71: 481-539Google Scholar). The last has received a great deal of attention after the presence of heparin or heparan sulfate had been shown to be prerequisite for high affinity binding of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to its cell surface fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) (10Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar, 11Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Google Scholar, 12Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Google Scholar). It was thought originally that binding to HS might change the growth factor conformation so that it can be recognized by the FGFR; however, cocrystallization of bFGF with heparin oligosaccharides demonstrated no structural changes in the growth factor upon the binding (13Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Google Scholar). Since heparin can form a ternary complex with bFGF and FGFR (14Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hon J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Google Scholar, 15Nugent M.A. Edelman E.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8876-8883Google Scholar, 16Pantoliano M.W. Horlick R.A. Springer B.A. Van Dyk D.E. Tobery T. Wetmore D. Lear J.D. Nahapetian A.T. Bradley J.D. Sisk W.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10229-10248Google Scholar), it has been proposed that the proteoglycans function as a coreceptor for the growth factor and could mediate FGFR dimerization (16Pantoliano M.W. Horlick R.A. Springer B.A. Van Dyk D.E. Tobery T. Wetmore D. Lear J.D. Nahapetian A.T. Bradley J.D. Sisk W.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10229-10248Google Scholar), a step that is required for FGFR tyrosine kinase activation and signal transfer. In addition, HS glycosaminoglycans are thought to act as bFGF reservoirs in extracellular matrix (17Bashkin P. Doctrow S. Klagsbrun M. Svahn C.-M. Folkman J. Vlodavsky I. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1737-1743Google Scholar, 18Ishai-Michaeli R. Eldor A. Vlodavsky I. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 833-842Google Scholar) and facilitate and direct bFGF diffusion to the sites of its action (for review, see 19Schlessinger J. Lax I. Lemmon M. Cell. 1995; 83: 357-360Google Scholar). heparan sulfate proteoglycan(s) heparan sulfate basic fibroblast growth factor fibroblast growth factor receptor Chinese hamster ovary high performance liquid chromatography dithiothreitol N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate 3-[N-morpholino]-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid It has been demonstrated that bFGF can be internalized both while bound to FGFR or HSPG (20Roghani M. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22156-22162Google Scholar) and that these pathways are different (21Reiland J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1085-1093Google Scholar). Since the interaction with HS protects bFGF from proteolysis and denaturation (22Gospodarowitz D. Cheng J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 475-484Google Scholar, 23Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 138: 215-220Google Scholar, 24Saksela O. Moscatelli D. Sommer A. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 743-751Google Scholar), there was an interesting possibility that the HS in this complex is protected from degradation as well. Normally, HS glycosaminoglycans are released from core proteins and cleaved to shorter chains by heparanases (2Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Google Scholar, 25Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Google Scholar). This process is thought to occur in endosomes, since short HS chains are produced in cells with defective or inhibited lysosomal degradation (26Yanagishita M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11075-11082Google Scholar, 27Brauker J.H. Wang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13093-13101Google Scholar). If bound bFGF inhibits HS catabolism, this might alter the distribution of HSPG on the cell surface or produce HS glycosaminoglycan chains with specific biological functions. In addition, the interaction of HS chains with bFGF could target the complex to specific cellular locations. Any of these effects could have implications in regulation of cellular functions. We have characterized previously the initial steps in the catabolism of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell HSPGs (25Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Google Scholar). Because CHO cells express HSPGs that bind and internalize bFGF (20Roghani M. Moscatelli D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22156-22162Google Scholar), we decided to investigate the effects of bFGF ligand on HS catabolism in CHO cells. In this work, we show that bFGF inhibits in vitro cleavage of nascent HS chains from CHO cells by heparanase activities partially purified from the same source. The relationship between heparanase cleavage sites and bFGF binding sequences was analyzed by examining heparanase-degraded glycosaminoglycan chains for the growth factor binding, and the number of bFGF binding sites on nascent HS chain was estimated from bFGF protection assays. Our results led to a tentative model for the distribution of heparanase cleavage sites and bFGF binding sites on the nascent HS chains. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO K1) were obtained from the American Culture Collection (CCL-61). They were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% calf serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G (Sigma) at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere with 100% relative humidity. All radioactive labeling experiments were performed with sulfate-free defined medium with 2 or 10 mM glucose, prepared as described previously (28Esko J.D. Elgavish A. Prasthofer T. Taylor W.H. Weinke J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15725-15733Google Scholar). Cells were passaged by trypsinization every 3-4 days, and after 15-20 passages fresh cells were revived from frozen stocks stored in liquid nitrogen. Confluent CHO cells were incubated with 50 μCi/ml [35S]H2SO4 or [3H]glucosamine (DuPont NEN) in defined F-12 medium to incorporate label into both long, nascent HS chains and short, degraded glycosaminoglycans. 2K. J. Bame, unpublished results. Cells were released from the culture dish with 0.125% trypsin, and the long glycosaminoglycans in the trypsinate and the short cellular HS were isolated separately (25Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Google Scholar). Briefly, labeled glycosaminoglycans were purified on DEAE-Sephacel columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and precipitated with 80% (v/v) ethanol in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml chondroitin sulfate carrier (25Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Google Scholar). Residual peptides were removed from the glycosaminoglycans by incubating them with 0.5 M NaOH, 1 M NaBH4 at 4°C for 16 h. After neutralization with 10 M acetic acid, glycosaminoglycans were reprecipitated with ethanol, dried, and incubated with 100 milliunits of chondroitin-ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4.; ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA) for 16 h at 37°C to degrade the chondroitin sulfate. Long or short labeled HS chains were separated from chondroitin sulfate disaccharides by gel filtration chromatography on a Sepharose CL-6B column (102× 1 cm), equilibrated, and run in 0.2 M NH4HCO3 (25Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Google Scholar). Labeled HS chains of the desired size were pooled, concentrated by DEAE-Sephacel columns, desalted on a PD-10 gel filtration column (Pharmacia), lyophilized, and resuspended in water. Unlabeled HS glycosaminoglycans, used as a carrier in the enzyme assays, were prepared from the trypsinate of CHO cells in a similar manner, except higher amounts of starting material were used. On average, one preparation combined trypsinate from about 500 150-mm plates. The elution of the unlabeled HS glycosaminoglycans from the Sepharose CL-6B column was determined by Alcian blue staining of fraction aliquots immobilized on Immobilon-N membrane (Millipore) using a Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad) (29Buee L. Boyle N.J. Zhang L. Delacourte A. Fillit H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 238-242Google Scholar). The concentration of the purified HS was estimated by carbazole reaction (30Bitter T. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-336Google Scholar). Confluent CHO cells were incubated for 1 h in defined F-12 medium containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]H2SO4, and then the labeled proteoglycans were extracted from the cell surface with 1% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonide, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin to prevent degradation of protein cores (25Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Google Scholar). Proteoglycans in the extract were isolated by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography and anion exchange HPLC as described previously (25Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Google Scholar). Free HS chains were separated from intact proteoglycans by gel filtration on TSK 4000 HPLC column (TosoHaas; Montgomeryville, PA) (25Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Google Scholar). The heparanase activity used in these experiments was partially purified from CHO cells. Cells were grown to confluence in 150-mm-diameter plates and detached from the dish with 2 ml of 0.125% trypsin at 37°C. Trypsinization was stopped with soybean trypsin inhibitor, and the cells were released from the plate with a pipette. Cells were sedimented in a clinical centrifuge, resuspended in 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μl/plate of cells), and stored at −20°C until enough cell protein had been collected to begin the purification (around 240 150-mm dishes). Frozen cells were thawed, and fresh protease inhibitors and glutathione (1 mM final) were added to the suspension, then the cells were broken with a Dounce homogenizer. The cell homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g (Sorvall SS-34) to pellet nuclei and large organelles. Detergent and salt were added to the 15,000 × g supernatant to a final concentration of 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5 M NaCl, then the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to release heparanase activity from microsomal membranes. The 100,000 × g supernatant was diluted to bring the salt concentration below 0.1 M and applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated in 0.01 M HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM glutathione (buffer A). After the column was washed with buffer A, heparanase activity was eluted from the resin by increasing the NaCl concentration. Fractions containing heparanase activity (determined by the glycosaminoglycan degradation assay) were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and applied to a heparin Affi-Gel column equilibrated in 0.01 M sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM glutathione (buffer B). The column was washed with buffer B, then heparanase was eluted by a NaCl gradient in buffer B. Fractions containing heparanase activity were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and stored at −20°C until used in experiments. Heparanase activity was purified over 100-fold with these steps; however, there were still at least 20 silver-stained bands on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (data not shown). Activity is concentrated against 30,000 molecular weight cut-off membranes, suggesting that the enzyme(s) is greater than 30 kDa. Characterization of the partially purified activity suggests the Km of the enzyme for the long, 81-kDa CHO HS substrate is 10-20 nM. The enzyme has been shown to be an endoglucuronidase without any exoglycosidic activity (31Bame K.J. Robson K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2245-2251Google Scholar). Nascent CHO [35S]HS chains (5,000-15,000 cpm) were mixed with unlabeled CHO HS chains (11 nM final) 3The molar concentration of HS (11 nM) corresponds to approximately 0.9 mg/ml and was determined from the average molecular mass of the nascent CHO HS chain obtained by gel filtration (81.0 ± 5.4 kDa). and incubated for 16-20 h at 37°C with partially purified CHO heparanase (1-1.5 μg of protein) and varying concentrations of human recombinant bFGF (Promega; Madison, WI) or horse heart cytochrome c (Sigma). The total reaction volume was either 30 or 75 μl, and 21 mM citrate, 57 mM phosphate buffer was used to maintain pH 5.5. In some assays, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Sigma) was included in the reaction mixture. The extent of cleavage was determined by precipitating the HS chains with 1% cetylpyridinium chloride, 0.32 M NaCl, 40 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5 (25Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Google Scholar). Under these conditions, HS chains greater than 40 kDa (based on their elution from gel filtration column) precipitate out of solution and can be separated from soluble shorter chains by centrifugation.2 The amount of degraded chains was determined from the percentage of radioactivity remaining in the supernatant after centrifugation for 10 min. The size of the heparanase products was examined by gel filtration chromatography on either a TSK 3000 or TSK 4000 HPLC column. Both columns were equilibrated and run in 0.1 M KH2PO4, pH 6.0, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.2% Zwittergent, at a flow rate 0.5 ml/min. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and assayed for radioactivity. The columns were calibrated with heparin, HS, and chondroitin sulfate polysaccharides of known molecular weight. 4The molecular mass of HS glycosaminoglycans was determined by gel filtration on Sepharose CL-6B and TSK 3000 or TSK 4000 HPLC columns, calibrated with glycosaminoglycans of known size. Because the nascent CHO HS chains associated under normal conditions, 4 M guanidinium hydrochloride-containing buffer was used to determine their correct molecular mass. By our estimation, the nascent and short CHO HS chains are (81.0 ± 5.4) kDa and (6.0 ± 1.1) kDa, respectively. Purified CHO [35S]HSPGs (5,000 cpm) were mixed with either CHO nascent HS (11 nM final) or HSPG (0.9 mg of HS equivalent/ml) isolated from rat liver (32Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 415-422Google Scholar) and incubated for 16-20 h at 37°C with partially purified CHO heparanase (1-1.5 μg of protein) and varying concentrations of bFGF. The reaction conditions were kept the same as for the 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycan substrate, except 0.17% CHAPS and protease inhibitors were included in the assay. The reaction was stopped with 0.1 M Tris, 0.8 M NaCl, pH 8.0, and the extent of degradation was examined by gel filtration HPLC on a TSK 4000 column. Similar results were observed when either the CHO glycosaminoglycans or the rat liver proteoglycans were used as carrier. The affinity of the interaction between bFGF and HS chains was determined by affinity coelectrophoresis (33Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2678-2772Google Scholar). Labeled HS samples were applied into a horizontal slot in a 1% agarose gel (FMC BioProducts; Rockland, ME) and electrophoresed through precast 42-mm lanes containing different concentrations of bFGF. The gels were prepared as indicated by Lee and Lander (33Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2678-2772Google Scholar), using 50 mM MOPSO, 125 mM sodium acetate, pH 7.0, 1 mM DTT, and 0.5% CHAPS or 21 mM citrate, 57 mM phosphate, pH 5.5, 1 mM DTT, and 0.5% CHAPS. The electrophoresis running buffer was identical to the buffer used to prepare the gel, except CHAPS was excluded. Electrophoresis was performed for 110-130 min at 70 V (constant voltage). Gels containing nascent [35S]HS were dried under vacuum and subjected to autoradiography. To visualize the short [35S]HS chains or the 3H-labeled glycosaminoglycans, the gels were sequentially transferred into 100% acetic acid (by incubation in 25, 50, and 100% (v/v) acetic acid, 15 min each), then equilibrated for 1 h in 3% 2,5-diphenyloxazol (Sigma) in acetic acid (w/v). The 2,5-diphenyloxazol in the gel was precipitated by a 1-h incubation in water, then the gels were dried under vacuum and incubated with x-ray film (Fuji) at −70°C. In all cases, radioactive bands were analyzed by a laser densitometer (pdi, Inc., Huntington Station, NY), and apparent dissociation constants were determined from relative retardation of HS by the growth factor (33Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2678-2772Google Scholar). Nascent CHO [3H]HS chains (200,000 cpm) were mixed with unlabeled CHO glycosaminoglycans (11 nM final) and bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml final) and incubated for 6 h at 37°C with 3.7 milliunits heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7, Seikagaku) and heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8, Seikagaku), in the absence or presence of 1-1.5 μM bFGF. The reaction buffer was 1 mM calcium acetate, 40 mM sodium acetate, pH 7.0. To ensure the reaction went to completion, another 1.2 milliunits of each enzyme was added after 6 h and the mixture incubated an additional 2 h. The degradation products were analyzed by gel filtration on a P2 column (Bio-Rad, 116 × 1 cm), equilibrated in 0.5 M pyridine acetate, pH 5.0. One-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 5 ml/h, and an aliquot of each was assayed for radioactivity. The voided 3H-labeled oligosaccharides protected from cleavage by the growth factor were pooled, and their size was determined on a TSK 3000 gel filtration column. Nascent CHO HS chains are on average 370 residues long, as estimated from their molecular mass (81 kDa4) and average sugar unit mass (220 Da). Then for each oligosaccharide peak (i) from the P2 column, which showed a relative increase in 3H-labeled cpm when bFGF was included in the reaction mixture, the total number of protected sugar residues/chain (ni) can be calculated as follows ni=(pbFGF−p)*370/100 where P and PbFGF are the percentage of radioactivity eluting in the same peak when bFGF was absent or present in the assay, respectively. The number of bFGF binding sequences/chain (N) is determined as N=∑(nildpi) where dpi (degree of polymerization) is the number of sugar residues in the corresponding oligosaccharide. An in vitro HS degradation assay, developed in our laboratory, was used to examine the effect of bFGF on the cleavage of HS glycosaminoglycans by partially purified CHO heparanase activities. Nascent HS chains from CHO cells (81 kDa, on average), were incubated with heparanase and varying concentrations of bFGF for 20 h. The long incubation time was chosen to allow heparanases to degrade HS substrate completely to short chains. The extent of cleavage was estimated by precipitating uncleaved chains with cetylpyridinium chloride. The results (Fig. 1) show that increasing concentrations of the growth factor inhibit formation of short soluble HS chains, with 50% inhibition achieved at about 500 nM bFGF. Production of short glycosaminoglycans is abolished completely in the presence of 1,000-2,500 nM bFGF. The inhibition of HS degradation appears to be specific for the growth factor, since cytochrome c, a protein of size and isoelectric point similar to those of bFGF, has no effect on the process (Fig. 1). A direct interaction between HS and the growth factor appears to be required, since the inhibition of cleavage can be reversed by adding more unlabeled HS, but not chondroitin sulfate, to the assay (data not shown). This would also suggest that bFGF inhibits the degradation by binding HS rather than the enzyme, although at present, we cannot exclude that bFGF might interact with CHO heparanase. To circumvent the possibility that the interaction of bFGF with short HS chains renders them cetylpyridinium chloride-precipitable, thus causing the apparent inhibition, we used gel filtration to resolve the heparanase degradation products. This method will also establish whether intermediate size chains are formed when bFGF is present in the degradation assay. Once we confirmed that bFGF did not alter the elution profile of either nascent or short HS (data not shown), the size of the heparanase products created in the presence of various bFGF concentrations was analyzed by gel filtration HPLC on a TSK 3000 column. In the absence of the growth factor, most of the nascent 81-kDa chains, which normally elute at the void volume of the column (Fig. 2A, arrow), are converted by CHO heparanases to short, 6.0 ± 1.1-kDa species (Fig. 2A). Although 76 nM bFGF does not significantly affect the degradation of the long HS by heparanases (Fig. 2A), a 5-fold increase of the growth factor concentration is sufficient to prevent most of the cleavage, so that the majority of the glycosaminoglycan chains elute at the void volume (Fig. 2A). In some experiments, intermediate size chains were formed in the presence of bFGF concentrations below and around 350 nM (data not shown). These observations suggest that at lower bFGF concentrations, the growth factor only prevents the catabolism of the glycosaminoglycan in the vicinity of its binding site. To ensure that the voided material did not consist of multiple sized HS species, the experiments were repeated and the products analyzed on a TSK 4000 column, which has better resolution for higher molecular weights. The results obtained correlate well with those from TSK 3000 HPLC. Formation of intermediate sized chains is observed at 200-300 nM bFGF, but at higher growth factor concentrations the majority of glycosaminoglycans elute from the column at a position comparable to that of the nascent HS chains (data not shown). These experiments suggest that a 30-60 molar excess of bFGF is required to inhibit HS catabolism completely. It has been shown that in a nonreducing environment bFGF is able to form dimers through surface cysteine residues (34Fox G.M. Schiffer S.G. Rohde M.F. Tsai L.B. Banks A.R. Arakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18452-18458Google Scholar). Although these dimers do not appear to have a biological function (34Fox G.M. Schiffer S.G. Rohde M.F. Tsai L.B. Banks A.R. Arakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18452-18458Google Scholar), since electrophoretic analysis of the bFGF used in our assays showed that the preparation was a mixture of monomeric and dimeric forms (data not shown), we wanted to examine whether bFGF dimers might carry out the inhibition in a manner different from that of the growth factor monomers. Therefore, we repeated the degradation of nascent HS in the presence of 1 mM DTT and analyzed the degradation products on the TSK 3000 column (Fig. 2B). Under reducing conditions when only bFGF monomers are present in the assay, higher concentrations of the growth factor are necessary to achieve the same inhibitory effect as in the absence of DTT (compare Fig. 2, A and B). These results suggest that the bFGF dimers shield the HS chain from heparanase action more efficiently than the bFGF monomers. In CHO cells, the initial catabolic steps may occur while the HS chains are still covalently attached to the protein core (25Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether bFGF also inhibits HS chain degradation when the glycosaminoglycans are a part of a proteoglycan. Instead of free glycosaminoglycans, [35S]HSPGs were used as a substrate in the in vitro heparanase assay, and the reaction products were analyzed on a TSK 4000 gel filtration column (Fig. 3). In the absence of the growth factor, heparanases cleave HS chains off the protein core and degrade them to 6-kDa species (Fig. 3). In the presence of 381 nM bFGF, intermediate size chains are formed instead (Fig. 3). Presumably, these products are both partially degraded free glycosaminoglycans and short chains still attached to the protein cores. When the growth factor concentration is increased to 951 nM, the catabolism of the proteoglycans is virtually abolished, and the majority of the HS material elutes from the column with a Kav comparable to that of an uncleaved HSPG substrate (Fig. 3). These results suggest that besides inhibiting glycosaminoglycan degradation, bFGF also prevents heparanases from releasing HS chains from protein cores. The inhibition of HS and HSPG catabolism in vitro occurs at a similar concentration of bFGF, indicating that the protein core has no significant effect on the ability of the growth factor to inhibit heparanase-catalyzed degradation of attached HS chains. One possibility for the observation that the binding of bFGF to the HS chains prevents heparanases from acting on the glycosaminoglycan would be that the growth factor binds to the same sequence cleaved by the enzyme. If this were the case, one would expect that the short heparanase-degraded glycosaminoglycans would no longer bind bFGF. To test this, nascent and heparanase-degraded HS chains were isolated from CHO cells (see “Experimental Procedures”) and examined for their"

An essential role for this Ser-Tyr dyad in HGPRT catalysis has now been verified biochemically and genetically for the Leishmania donovani HGPRT employing a combination of protein modifying reagents and site-directed mutagenesis. Incubation of HGPRT with either tetranitromethane or diethyl pyrocarbonate inactivated the enzyme completely, and peptide sequence analysis revealed that tetranitromethane treatment modified the Tyr residue within the Ser95-Tyr96 dipeptide. Analysis of site-directed mutants confirmed that both amino acids were vital for phosphoribosylation activity. Mutant HGPRTs, S95A, S95E, Y96F, and Y96V, exhibited dramatic reductions in their catalytic capabilities of 2–3 orders of magnitude, whereas HGPRTs containing conservative substitutions, S95C and S95T, displayed only a 2–3-fold decrease in kcat. Km values for the substrates of the forward and reverse reactions were largely unchanged for all HGPRT constructs, except for a 4–5-fold decrease in the Km value of the Y96F and Y96V mutants for phosphoribosylpyrophosphate. Expression of L. donovani hgprt constructs in Escherichia coli indicated that wild type and S95T HGPRTs complemented bacterial phosphoribosyltransferase deficiencies, whereas the S95A and S95C mutants complemented weakly, and the S95E, Y96F, and Y96V HGPRT did not support bacterial growth. These data authenticate that the Ser-Tyr dipeptide that is conserved among all members of the HGPRT family is essential for phosphoribosylation of purine nucleobases by HGPRT. Crystal structures of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) proteins have implied that the translocation of a flexible loop containing a highly conserved Ser-Tyr dipeptide is necessary for the protection of the proposed oxocarbonium ion transition state of the enzyme (Eads, J.

Glutathione sulfonate, an inhibitor of the enzyme, gives nearly complete protection against inactivation and prevents modification, indicating that these residues form part of or reside close to the active site. Sequence analysis of peptides from peptic and tryptic digests of [7-14C]phenylglyoxal- and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzenesulfonate-treated microsomal glutathione transferase indicated arginine 107 and lysine 67 as the sites of modification. A set of mutant forms of microsomal glutathione transferase was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Arginine 107 was exchanged for alanine and lysine residues. The alanine mutant (R107A) exhibited an activity and inhibition profile similar to that of the wild type enzyme but displayed a decreased thermostability. Thus, arginine 107 does not appear to participate in catalysis or substrate binding; instead, an important structural role is suggested for this residue. Lysine 67 was mutated to alanine and arginine with no effect on activity. All three histidines were replaced by glutamine, and the resulting mutant proteins had activities comparable with that of the wild type. It can thus be concluded that the chemical modification experiments indicating that arginine 107, lysine 67, and one of the histidines partake in catalysis can be disproved. However, protection from modification by a competitive inhibitor indicates that these residues could be close to the glutathione binding site. All tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions resulted in mutants with activities similar to that of the wild type. Interestingly, the exchange of tyrosine 137 appears to result in activation of the enzyme. Thus, the microsomal glutathione transferase must display an alternate stabilization of the thiolate anion of glutathione other than through interaction with the phenolic hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue. Substitution of cysteine 49 with alanine resulted in a semiactivated mutant enzyme with enzymatic properties partly resembling the activated form of microsomal glutathione transferase. The function of this mutant was not altered upon reaction with N-ethylmaleimide, and cysteine 49 is thus demonstrated as the site of modification that results in activation of microsomal glutathione transferase.

Microsomal glutathione transferase (1Morgenstern R. DePierre J.W. Ketterer B. Sies H. Glutathione Conjugation: Its Mechanism and Biological Significance. Academic Press Ltd., London1988: 157-174Google Scholar) is a membrane-bound member of the glutathione transferase family of enzymes (2Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 283-337Google Scholar). Glutathione transferases (GSTs) 1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferaseNEMN-ethylmaleimidePGphenylglyoxalTNBS1,3,5-trinitrobenzenesulfonatePCRpolymerase chain reactionHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyCDNB1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene are a group of phase II detoxication enzymes that catalyze the conjugation of glutathione to a variety of molecules bearing different electrophilic centers, which are all hydrophobic (3Chasseaud L.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1979; 29: 175-274Google Scholar). Thus, the GSTs aid in the detoxication of numerous carcinogenic, toxic, and pharmacologically active substances (3Chasseaud L.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1979; 29: 175-274Google Scholar). The transferases exist as multiple cytosolic isoforms with molecular mass values in the 24–28-kDa region (4Mannervik B. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

Guo K. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4534-4542Google Scholar) and a membrane-bound microsomal GST. Rat microsomal GST has a molecular mass of 17.3 kDa with an amino acid sequence analyzed both at the protein and cDNA level (7Morgenstern R. DePierre J.W. Jörnvall H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13976-13983Google Scholar, 8DeJong J.L. Morgenstern R. Jörnvall H. DePierre J.W. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8430-8436Google Scholar). Microsomal GST is present at the highest levels in the liver and has been purified from rat (9Morgenstern R. Guthenberg C. DePierre J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 243-248Google Scholar), mouse (10Andersson C. Söderström M. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 819-823Google Scholar), and human (11McLellan L.I. Wolf C.R. Hayes J.D. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 87-93Google Scholar). These species express closely related enzymes. In contrast to the cytosolic GSTs, which are dimeric proteins, the microsomal transferase is a trimer that contains one single cysteine residue per subunit (7Morgenstern R. DePierre J.W. Jörnvall H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13976-13983Google Scholar, 8DeJong J.L. Morgenstern R. Jörnvall H. DePierre J.W. Tu C.-P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8430-8436Google Scholar, 9Morgenstern R. Guthenberg C.

The microsomal GST is activated in vitro by various treatments such as covalent modification of cysteine 49 by sulfhydryl reagents (13Morgenstern R. DePierre J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 591-597Google Scholar), limited proteolysis (14Morgenstern R. Lundqvist G. Jörnvall H. DePierre J.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 577-582Google Scholar), heating (15Aniya Y. J. Pharmacobio-Dyn. 1989; 12: 235-240Google Scholar), and reactive oxygen species (16Aniya Y. Anders M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1998-2002Google Scholar).

The projection structure of the membrane-bound, structurally distinct microsomal GST has been solved at 4-Å resolution (12Hebert H. Schmidtkrey I. Morgenstern R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3864-3869Google Scholar). A previous investigation utilizing chemical modification with selective reagents indicated the importance of arginine, lysine, and histidine residues for the catalytic function of rat microsomal GST (22Andersson C. Morgenstern R. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 479-484Google Scholar). In many cytosolic GSTs studied, a tyrosine residue has been identified as having a critical role in catalysis by stabilizing the nucleophilic thiolate anion of the enzyme-bound GSH molecule. This activation of the thiol is suggested to occur by the phenolic hydroxyl group of the tyrosine residue (or serine hydroxyl in Theta class enzymes) interacting with the sulfur of GSH (23Liu S. Zhang P. Ji X. Johnson W.W. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4296-4299Google Scholar, 24Kong K.H. Takasu K. Inoue H. Takahashi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. 1995; 311: 247-250Google Scholar). Clearly, it is of interest to investigate a possible similar function of a tyrosine residue in the microsomal GST as well as the role of cysteine for activation. The development of heterologous expression and purification of recombinant microsomal GST from Escherichia coli has opened new possibilities to examine the structure and function of this enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis. In this study, we have investigated whether amino acids previously implicated in catalysis or activation could be verified or excluded. Some of the results have been communicated in a preliminary form (27Andersson C. Mosialou E. Weinander R. Hebert H. Morgenstern R. Tew K.D. Picket C.B. Mantle T.J. Mannervik B. Hayes J.D.

[7-14C]Phenylglyoxal and [α-35S]dATP were purchased from Amersham (United Kingdom). Pepsin was purchased from Worthington (Freehold, NJ). Trypsin (L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated) and lysozyme were from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). Plasmid DNA isolation and gel extraction kits were from Qiagen (Germany). DNA sequencing kit was from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Media and buffers for bacteria and DNA experiments were prepared as described (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). All other chemicals were of highest purity and obtained from common commercial sources. Microsomal glutathione transferase was purified from male Sprague Dawley rat livers as described previously (13Morgenstern R. DePierre J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 134: 591-597Google Scholar). Glutathione was removed from the purified enzyme as described by Weinander et al. (30Weinander R. Anderson C. Morgenstern R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 71-76Google Scholar) or by ion exchange chromatography. For the latter procedure, the enzyme was diluted in 10 volumes of 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol (v/v), and 1 mM GSH (buffer A) and applied to a CM-Sepharose cation exchange column equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 5 volumes of buffer A devoid of GSH, and the glutathione-free enzyme was eluted by the addition of 0.2 M KCl in buffer A. Removal of GSH was checked as described (30Weinander R. Anderson C. Morgenstern R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 71-76Google Scholar). Enzyme activities with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB; 0.5 mM) were assayed at 340 nm in 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 at 30°C (31Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Google Scholar). When activity was determined in bacterial membranes and crude fractions, the concentration of Triton X-100 was increased to 1% to avoid an increase in turbidity. The activity with 4-chloro-3-nitrobenzamide was determined at 370 nm as described (32Keen J.H. Habig W.H. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 6183-6188Google Scholar). The activity of C49A with N-acetyl-L-cysteine and CDNB was determined with the partially purified enzyme where GSH had been removed by the addition of 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and 5-min incubation on ice. C49A lacks thiol groups, and incubation with NEM did not have any effect on the activity of this mutant with any substrate used. Although it could not be completely excluded, the possible inhibition by the presence of GS-NEM product in the assay did not appear to be of any importance (the activities were linear with added enzyme). kcat/Km for C49A was determined directly with one substrate saturating and the other at low concentration under first order conditions. When inhibition was studied, the substrates and enzyme were first mixed, and the control activity was determined (approximately 20 s) followed by the addition of inhibitor. All assays were repeated at least three times, and all background rates were subtracted. Thermostability was determined by placing an aliquot of enzyme at room temperature (approximately 24°C). GST activity was assayed at the time points indicated in Fig. 3. Activation of the purified enzyme with 2–5 mM NEM was performed at 4°C in 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol (v/v), 1 mM GSH, and 0.1 M KCl. When maximal activity was reached (within 5 min), the reaction was terminated by the addition of GSH to give a final concentration of the free thiol of approximately 1 mM. The GSH-free enzyme was activated by the addition of 0.5 mM NEM. Carry-over of NEM to the assay had only marginal effects on the GSH concentration (<0.5%). Purified glutathione-free microsomal GST (about 2 mg/ml) in buffer A was treated with 0.5 mM NEM and mixed with an equal amount of 0.2 M potassium phosphate, pH 8.0. The modification reaction was then started by the addition of 5 mM phenylglyoxal (PG) dissolved in 50% ethanol. The incubation contained 2.5% (v/v) ethanol (final concentration), which did not influence control activity. Reactions were performed at room temperature in the absence and presence of 2 mM glutathione sulfonate, respectively. Aliquots were withdrawn for assay at time points indicated in Fig. 1. 8 nmol of glutathione-free, NEM-treated microsomal glutathione transferase was incubated with 14C-labeled PG (1100 cpm/nmol) in a volume of 200 μl of 50% buffer A, 50% 0.2 M potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, at room temperature in the absence and presence of 2 mM glutathione sulfonate. 30-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn after 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min and precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated enzyme was pelleted and washed three times with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Pellets were dissolved in 0.1 ml of formic acid, and the amounts of PG incorporated were determined by scintillation counting. In parallel incubations, 5 mM PG was added at room temperature in the absence and presence of 2 mM glutathione sulfonate, and the activity versus time was determined. 300 nmol of microsomal GST (glutathione-free and NEM-treated) was reacted with 20 μCi of [14C]PG in a volume of 4 ml of the buffer described above in the absence and presence of 2 mM glutathione sulfonate, respectively. The final concentration of PG in the mixture was 5 mM. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 25 min, whereafter 10 μl of the respective mixture was assayed for GST activity to ensure that inactivation/protection was complete. Detergent and free PG was removed from the protein by cation exchange chromatography on a Sep Pak Accell Plus CM column (Waters) that had been equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 5 mM potassium phosphate followed by water. The enzyme was eluted with 4 × 1 ml of formic acid, and the two fractions with the highest protein content (as determined by absorption at 280 nm) were pooled and dried under N2. Thereafter, the enzyme was dissolved in 100 μl of formic acid and digested by pepsin (0.25 mg/ml) in a volume of 2 ml of 5% formic acid at 37°C overnight. The resulting peptide mixtures were dried with N2 and dissolved in 0.5 ml of formic acid. Peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a CT-sil C-18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm). The solvent system consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile with a linear gradient of 0-5% acetonitrile over 10 min followed by 5–50% acetonitrile over 110 min and, thereafter, 50–80% acetonitrile over 10 min. Elution was monitored at 214 nm, and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. Peak fractions were collected manually, and the radioactivity in each fraction was determined by scintillation counting of a 25-μl aliquot. Fractions containing the peak radioactivities were rechromatographed on the same column using the same solvent system. Fractions containing the radioactive peptides from this second round of chromatography were sequenced as described below. 50% of the obtained amino acid phenylthiohydantoin derivatives were subjected to amino acid identification, and 50% were taken for scintillation counting. Purified glutathione-free, NEM-treated microsomal GST (about 2 mg/ml) was mixed with an equal amount of 0.2 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.5 mM TNBS dissolved in 0.2 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0. Incubation was performed at room temperature in the absence/presence of 2 mM glutathione sulfonate, and aliquots were withdrawn for assay at the time points indicated in Fig. 1. To ensure that protection of the enzyme activity by glutathione sulfonate was not a result of reaction of the inhibitor and TNBS, the reaction rate of 0.5 mM TNBS and 2 mM glutathione sulfonate was determined at 345 nm, assuming a molar extinction coefficient for the reaction product of 1.1 × 104M−1 cm−1 (33Haynes R. Osuga D.T. Feeney R.E. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 541-547Google Scholar). In all experiments, this rate was very low, and the possibility that glutathione sulfonate gave protection by reacting with and depleting TNBS could thus be excluded. Approximately 5 nmol of glutathione-free, NEM-treated microsomal GST was incubated with 0.5 mM TNBS in a volume of 100 μl of 50% buffer A, 50% 0.2 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, in the absence and presence of 2 mM glutathione sulfonate at room temperature. 20-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were withdrawn after 0, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min, denatured, and dissolved in 5% formic acid. The number of trinitrophenylated amino groups was determined from the absorbance at 345 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 1.1 × 104M−1 cm−1 (33Haynes R. Osuga D.T. Feeney R.E. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 541-547Google Scholar). 150 nmol of glutathione-free, NEM-treated microsomal GST was reacted with 0.5 mM TNBS in the absence and presence of 2 mM glutathione sulfonate. The reactions were performed in a volume of 3 ml of the buffer described above for 20 min at room temperature. A 10-μl aliquot of the respective mixture was withdrawn for assay of the inactivation/protection. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ML-lysine, and the mixtures were dialyzed against 0.4 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 8 M urea until all Triton X-100 was removed from the solutions as determined from the decrease in absorbance at 275 nm. Thereafter, the mixtures were dialyzed against H2O for 48 h. The protein was digested by trypsin (1:50, w/w) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37°C for 5 h. Peptide mixtures were dried with N2 and dissolved in 0.5 ml of formic acid. Peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using the same system as described above with a linear gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile over 45 min. Elution was monitored at 214 and 345 nm. Peak fractions were collected manually, and the fraction containing the peak absorbance at 345 nm was subjected to sequence analysis. The amino acid sequence of the peptides was determined by automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 470 A instrument. Amino acid phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC as described (34Kaiser R. Holmquist B. Hempel J. Vallee B.L. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1132-1140Google Scholar). The plasmid pSP19T7LTrμGT, in which cDNA coding for wild type rat microsomal GST has been ligated (35Weinander R. Mosialou E. Dejong J. Tu C.-P.D. Dypbukt J. Bergman T. Barnes H.J. Höög J.O. Morgenstern R. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 861-866Google Scholar), was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis utilizing PCR. Oligonucleotide primers used to construct mutants are shown in Table I. To construct K67A and K67R, the PCRs were performed with the primer rU1, which contains the sense sequence of the 5′-end of the coding region of the microsomal GST cDNA and the respective antisense primer directing the Lys67 mutations. The PCR products were digested with NdeI and MluI, gel-purified, and ligated into the vector pSP19T7LTrμGT that had been cut with NdeI and MluI and gel-purified.TABLE I.Oligonucleotide primers used to construct mutant forms of rat microsomal GSTPrimerSenseSequenceaThe mismatches to wild type directing the codon changes are underlined.Amino acid changedK67AInverse5′-TCGCACGCGTTCCACCTCGTCAGTC-3′Lys67→ AlaK67RInverse5′-TCGCACGCGTTCCACCTCGTCAGTC-3′Lys67→ ArgR107AInverse5′-TCCGAGCGCCCACAAAGATGAAGTGAATG-3′Arg107→ AlaR107KInverse5′-TCCGAGCGCCCACAAAGATGAAGTGAATG-3′Arg107→ LysC49AForward5′-GCCAACCCGGAAGACGCTGGCTTC-3′Cys49→ AlaH75QForward5′-GAAGAGCCCTGAATGA-3′His75→ GlnH105QInverse5′-TCCGAGCGCCCACAAAGATTCTGAAAATGAG-3′His105→ GlnH116QForward5′-GGATCTACACCATTGC-3′His116→ GlnY92FInverse5′-GATCCGGTCCGCTCAGGGACAGGAGGC-3′Tyr92→ PheY115FForward5′-TGTGGGCGCTCGGATCCACACCATT-3′Tyr115→ PheY120FForward5′-TGTGGGCGCTGCGATCTACCACACCATTGCTTTGACTCCC-3′Tyr120→ PheY137FForward5′-GTTGGCGGAGTTA-3′Tyr137→ PheY145FForward5′-ACGGAGTTACTTTGTCAATGGCTAGGCTGCTC-3′Tyr145→ PheY153FInverse5′-CGAAGCTTATTACAACAGTCTGCT-3′Tyr153→ PherU1Forward5′-CGCATATGGCTGACCTCAAG-3′rLInverse5′-CGAAGCTTATTACAAGTACAGTCTG-3′a The mismatches to wild type directing the codon changes are underlined. Open table in a new tab The Arg107 mutations and H105Q were constructed in a PCR with the respective antisense mutagenic primer against rU1. Products were digested with NdeI and HhaI, gel-purified, and ligated in a mixture with the vector pSP19T7LT that had been cut with NdeI and HindIII and a DNA segment coding for the C-terminal part of wild type rat microsomal GST, which had been cut with HhaI and HindIII. To introduce the mutations C49A, H75Q, H116Q, Y115F, Y120F, Y137F, and Y145F, the PCRs were made with the respective mutagenic sense primers and the antisense primer rL, which contains the 3′-end of the coding region. The resulting PCR products were gel-purified and thereafter used as mutagenic “megaprimers” in a second PCR against rU1. Y92F and Y153F were also constructed with the “megapriming” technique. In this case, the antisense mutagenic primers were used in PCRs together with the sense primer rU1, and the products were subsequently used as megaprimers against rL in the second PCR. All products from this second PCR were digested with NdeI and HindIII, gel-purified, and ligated into the expression vector pSP19T7LT that had been cut with NdeI and HindIII. PCRs were performed with 0.2 mM dNTPs, 2 mM MgCl2, a 0.25 μM concentration of the respective primer, about 0.1 pmol of template, and 0.5 units of Vent (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) or Pfu (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) polymerase. The temperature cycles were 30 s at 94°C, 1 min at 40°C, and 2 min at 72°C, repeated 10 times followed by 30 s at 94°C, 1 min at 50°C, and 2 min at 72°C, repeated 20 times. The reaction was terminated by a 7-min extension at 72°C. All constructs were transformed into competent E. coli JM-109 or XL-1 Blue as described (36Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 23-28Google Scholar), positive clones were identified, and the plasmids were isolated. The inserts were sequenced by the chain termination method of Sanger et al. (37Sanger F. Nicken S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar), and plasmids containing the desired mutations were transformed into E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) (that contained the plasmid pLysSL (38Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Google Scholar)). Glycerol stocks were prepared and stored frozen at −70°C for subsequent use as starting material for the expression experiments. A small aliquot (1-2 μl) of bacterial glycerol stock was grown in 1.5 ml of 2 × YT overnight at 37°C. The culture was diluted 1:100 in TB (terrific broth) and grown until the A600 was 0.4-1.2. At this point, the temperature was switched to 30°C, and expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside, followed by another 4 h shaking (250 rpm) of the culture. All steps were performed in the presence of ampicillin (75 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml). Thereafter, cells were pelleted and resuspended in TSEG buffer (15 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 M sucrose, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM GSH). The cells were lysed by sonication using four 30-s pulses from a MSE Soniprep 150 sonifier at 40–60% of maximum power. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 60 min, and the membrane pellets were suspended in 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM GSH. Overnight cultures were prepared as described above and diluted into 3 liters of TB containing ampicillin (75 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml) in a 5-liter flask placed in a thermostated water bath. The expression of mutant microsomal GST was induced, and the culture was grown under the same conditions as described above except that oxygenation was provided by air bubbling instead of shaking. After the cells were pelleted and resuspended, lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml, and the mixture was gently stirred for 30 min at 4°C. The resulting spheroplasts were pelleted (8000 × g, 10 min), resuspended in TSEG buffer, and lysed by sonication as described above. Magnesium chloride was added to a final concentration of 6 mM, and DNA and RNA were hydrolyzed by DNase I (4 μg/ml) and RNase A (4 μg/ml) for an additional 30 min at 4°C with gentle stirring. Membranes were prepared as described above and solubilized by the addition of an equal volume of 10 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 mM GSH, and 10% Triton X-100. Insoluble particles were removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 20 min). Partial purification of recombinant mutant microsomal GST was performed as follows. Solubilized membranes were adsorbed to 30 g of hydroxyapatite (Bio-Gel HTP, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A for 15 min. Hydroxyapatite elution was performed by a batch procedure where the hydroxyapatite was pelleted by a low speed centrifugation pulse and washed with 2 volumes of buffer A, followed by 1 volume of 50 mM potassium phosphate in buffer A. Recombinant mutant enzyme was eluted with 0.4 M potassium phosphate in buffer A and desalted by dialysis for 20 h against 30 volumes of buffer A. Further purification was performed by ion exchange chromatography on a 5-ml HiTrap SP column (Pharmacia, Sweden) equilibrated with buffer A. The enzyme was eluted by a linear gradient of 1 M KCl in buffer A, and 1-ml fractions were collected at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min. Microsomal GST content of the fractions was determined by measurement of GST activity. Solubilization and purification was performed at 4°C. Fractions with peak activity were analyzed by gel e"

In this study, we investigated whether v-Abl regulates the activity of the transcription factor E2F-1. Introduction of the v-abl oncogene into an interleukin-3-dependent murine myeloid cell line (32D-123) leads to growth factor independence and unregulated cell proliferation (10Pierce J.H.

Oncogene. 1990; 5: 549-555PubMed Google Scholar). 32D-123 cells and 32D-abl cells were grown as described previously (36Keller J.R. Ruscetti S.K. Ruscetti F.W. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 549-555PubMed Google Scholar). CCL-64 (mink lung epithelial) cells and C33A (human cervical) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. CCL-64 and C33A cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method, using either 10 μg of control plasmid or 10 μg of v-Abl expression plasmid. Cells were harvested 48 h after the addition of DNA, and extracts were assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity. The murine myeloid 32D-123 and 32D-abl cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (37Birchenall-Roberts Kim S.-J. Bertolette III, D.C. Turley J.M. Fu T. Bang O.-K. Kasper J.J. Yoo Y.D. Ruscetti F.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1499-1509PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA concentration was equalized in each case by the addition of pUC when necessary. After 24 h at 37°C, cells were harvested, and the protein concentration of cell lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of protein were used to assay for the CAT enzyme. For normalization of transfection efficiencies, a human growth hormone expression plasmid (pSVGH) was included in the cotransfections. The level of growth hormone expression was determined using a growth hormone detection kit (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). All experiments were repeated at least three times. Plasmids containing a deletion mutant or mutations in the enhancer of the adenovirus E2 promoter linked to the CAT gene were a generous gift of Dr. John Brady (NCI, Bethesda, MD) and were described previously (4Van Etten R.A.

Ruscetti F.W. Kasper J. Bertolette III, D.C. Yoo Y.D. Bang O.-K. Roberts M.S. Turley J.M. Ferris D.K. Kim S.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6088-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The GAL4-E2F-1, cytomegalovirus-E2F-1 and GST-E2F-1 constructs (a generous gift of William G. Kaelin, Harvard Medical School, Boston) were described previously (39Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). For the construction of GST fusion plasmids, polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into pGEX-2T using standard methods to generate GST-E2F-1 (89-190, 89–250, 89–400, 89–437, 188–250, 251–400, and 251–437). All GAL4-E2F-1 fusion plasmids were constructed by inserting the appropriate E2F-1 DNA fragment in-frame to the GAL4 (1–147) sequence in the vector pSG424 (40Sadowski I. Ma J. Triszenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). E2F-1 DNA fragments were produced by polymerase chain reaction. The 5′-oligonucleotide contained an EcoRI site, and the 3′-oligonucleotide contained an XbaI site. Using these oligonucleotides, fragments were amplified according to the standard protocol of the GeneAmp kit (Perkin-Elmer). The junctions of all GAL4 fusion plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte extracts, various portions of the v-abl coding regions were placed in-frame behind the phage T7 promoter in the pGEM4 plasmid (Promega). v-abl DNA fragments with terminal BamHI and EcoRI sites were produced by polymerase chain reaction. Antibodies used in this study were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. unless otherwise specified. Normal control IgG was obtained from Sigma. For coimmunoprecipitations, 2 × 107 cells were lysed with 100 μl of RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0)) containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Antibody (1 μg) was incubated with the extracts for 1 h at 4°C. The antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated with protein G-Plus Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed three times with RIPA containing 1% bovine serum albumin, three times with RIPA lacking bovine serum albumin, and then separated by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to reinforced nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed by Western blot analysis. The antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Corp.). In vivo phosphorylation analysis was carried out by labeling the 32D cells with inorganic 32P for 2 h at 37°C. 32P-Labeled cell extracts were prepared in RIPA containing phosphatase inhibitors (1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 30 mM NaF, 30 mM NaPPi), and proteins were immunoprecipitated with the specific antisera and analyzed by electrophoresis as described in the figures. Proteins were visualized by autoradiography and/or Western blot analysis. The GST-pull-down assay was performed as described previously (41Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1580-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The concentration of the GST fusion proteins was determined by Coomassie Blue staining. The beads were washed twice with NETN buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and once with binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 140 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mM NaF, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, and 1% bovine serum albumin). The beads were rocked for 1 h at room temperature with 2–10 μl of in vitro synthesized [35S]v-Abl protein in a final volume of 200 μl of binding buffer. The beads were then washed three times in 1 ml of NETN buffer, pelleted at 500 × g for 2 min, boiled in sample buffer, and the bound 35S-labeled v-Abl proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. For the pull-down assay of v-Abl from 32D-abl nuclear extracts by GST-E2F-1 deletion fusion proteins, the affinity matrix was prewashed in NETN with 500 mM NaCl, subsequently equilibrated in NETN buffer, and incubated with nuclear extracts. Bound proteins were detected by immunoblotting with specific antiserum to Abl. E2F was functionally defined as a transcription factor that mediates transcriptional activation of the adenovirus E2 promoter (24Yee A.S. Reichel P. Kovesdi I. Nevins J.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2061-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 42Loeken M.R. Brady J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6572-6579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of v-Abl to transactivate either the wild type E2 promoter or a series of E2F promoters containing 5–10-base pair mutations from −85 to −28 (Fig. 1 A). The E2-CAT reporter constructs were transfected into both 32D-123 cells and CCL-64 cells with either the v-Abl expression vector or the control vector. Fig. 1 B and C, shows data from a representative transfection. Expression of the v-abl gene resulted in a 2.5-6-fold increase in the level of expression arising from the wild type E2 reporter construct (pEC79). Single-site mutation of the ATF binding site between −80 and −70 or a single mutation of the E2F binding sites, −64 to −60 or −45 to −36, had minimal or no effect on v-Abl-mediated stimulation of E2 promoter activity (Fig. 1 C). Mutation of the ATF binding site, −75 to −71, or the second E2F binding site, −65 to −61, also had no effect on stimulation of the E2 promoter by v-Abl. We also tested the effect of v-Abl on an E2 reporter construct containing a double mutation ATF (−80 to −70) and E2F (−45 to −36; Fig. 1 C, lanes 11 and 12). Similar to the −80 to −70 mutation, an increase in CAT expression was observed in the presence of v-Abl. In contrast, mutation of both E2F binding sites at −64 to −60 and −45 to −36 abrogated induction of E2 promoter activity by v-Abl (Fig. 1 B and C, lanes 7 and 8 or 9 and 10, respectively), demonstrating that v-Abl activates E2 promoter activity through the E2F binding sites. Previous studies by our laboratories have shown that the p120-v-Abl protein is localized in the nucleus of 32D-abl cells and binds and activates the transcription factor CREB (37Birchenall-Roberts Kim S.-J.

To identify a possible association between E2F-1 and v-Abl leading to increased E2F transactivation, coimmunoprecipitations using antibodies to the E2F-1 protein followed by Western blot analysis using antibodies to the Abl protein were performed (Fig. 2 A). An association between v-Abl and E2F-1 was demonstrated in 32D-abl cells by detection of the v-Abl protein in the anti-E2F-1 immunoprecipitates. Immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Fos, Myc, or normal mouse IgG failed to precipitate the v-Abl protein. Next, the reciprocal experiments were performed. Using lysates from 32Pi-labeled 32D-abl cells, immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies to Abl or E2F-1 followed by Western blot with the indicated antibodies (Fig. 2 B-D) were conducted. The phosphorylated 120-kDa v-Abl protein (Fig. 2 B) and the 65-kDa E2F-1 protein (Fig. 2 C) were observed in anti-Abl and anti-E2F immunoprecipitates. As a control, immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Src and IgG failed to precipitate v-Abl or E2F-1 protein (Fig. 2 B-D). The identity of the E2F-1 protein was verified by Western blotting the same membrane as in Fig. 2 C with E2F-1 antibodies (Fig. 2 D). Immunoprecipitation and Western analysis of the v-Abl protein as well as Western analysis of the E2F-1 protein showed that 32D-abl cells express the v-Abl and E2F-1 proteins abundantly (Fig. 2 E). These results show that the immunoprecipitation of E2F-1 by the E2F-1 antibody is less than that of E2F-1 by the Abl antibody (Fig. 2 D). This could be a result of an innate difference in the antibodies such as lower antibody affinity. Overall, the data in Fig. 2 show that a significant portion of E2F-1 (but not all of E2F-1) is associated with v-Abl. To map the v-Abl binding site in E2F-1, we assayed the ability of the v-Abl protein from 32D-abl nuclear extracts to bind the GST-E2F-1 fusion protein (Fig. 3). v-Abl in the 32D-abl cell nuclear extracts bound GST fusion proteins containing either the RB binding domain (COOH-terminal, 38 amino acids from 400 to 437) or the DNA binding domain (amino acids 89–190) of the E2F-1 protein (Fig. 3 A and C). A protein consisting of the amino acids 188–400 showed no significant binding to v-Abl (data not shown). Also, two different constructions (188-250 and 251–400), which covered the region 188–400, failed to interact with v-Abl (Fig. 3 B). Thus, p120-v-Abl binds two distinct regions of the E2F-1 protein, the DNA binding domain and the RB binding domain. To examine whether the ability of v-Abl to bind E2F-1 leads to activation of E2F-1-mediated transcription, we expressed various GAL4-E2F-1 derivatives. These plasmids were cotransfected into the 32D-123 or 32D-abl cells with a CAT reporter (G5BCAT) containing five GAL4 binding sites upstream from the E1B TATA box (Fig. 4). The p120-v-Abl expression plasmid (Fig. 4 C) or the control vector pUC (Fig. 4 B) was also added to the cotransfection mixtures for the 32D-123 cells. Transcriptional activation directed by v-Abl was diminished with deletion of the COOH-terminal region of E2F-1 (Fig. 4 C, lane 9). v-Abl, however, had no effect on the transcriptional activation of the GAL4-DNA binding domain (see Fig. 6, Fig. 7). Using the same protocol, the mutant construct 10–200 was not susceptible to v-Abl activation (data not shown). This region is not involved in v-Abl-mediated E2F-1-transactivation. To determine whether v-Abl directly transactivates E2F-1 or merely releases E2F-1 from RB-mediated suppression, we cotransfected GAL4-E2F-1, both in the presence and absence of a v-abl expression construct, into C33A cells that are Rb−/−. v-Abl continued to demonstrate transactivation of E2F-1 in this Rb-lacking system, indicating that the effect of v-Abl on E2F-1-activated transcription occurs independent of the presence of RB (data not shown). To define the domain(s) of the v-Abl protein interacting with E2F-1, the ability of various in vitro translated v-Abl fragments to bind the GST-E2F-1 fusion protein was assayed (Fig. 5). The COOH-terminal 368 amino acids (611–981) or the NH2-terminal 355 amino acids of v-Abl did not bind E2F-1 via these regions (Fig. 5 B). Expression of various internal fusion proteins suggested that the E2F-1 binding domain in v-Abl is located in the kinase domain between amino acids 355 and 613 (Fig. 5 A and B). We therefore examined the activity of kinase domain deletion mutants of v-Abl to transactivate GAL4-E2F-1. Kinase-inactive v-Abl mutants containing either a point mutation (Abl-M1) or deletions (Abl-M7 and Abl-M9) in the ATP binding domain only minimally transactivated GAL4-E2F-1 (10-18% of wild type v-Abl; Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, a mutant form of v-Abl containing a deletion of the nuclear localization sequence (Abl-M6) similarly abolished the transactivation potential of the v-Abl protein (data not shown), indicating that nuclear expression is needed for the transactivation potential of v-Abl. Transfection of 32D-123 cells with plasmids encoding other members of the abl gene family, c-abl or the naturally occurring leukemogenic protein, BCR-abl, also stimulated E2F-1-mediated transcription (Fig. 7 B, lanes 3 and 4), whereas v-Abl, c-Abl or BCR-Abl did not stimulate G5BCAT expression in the presence of the GAL4 DNA binding domain alone (pSG147; lanes 5–8, Fig. 7 B). Since the v-Abl kinase domain is common to c-Abl and BCR-Abl, it is possible that c-Abl and BCR-Abl also interact with E2F-1 and stimulate E2F-1-mediated transcription through a similar mechanism. In this study, we found that v-Abl overexpression can stimulate transcription of the adenovirus E2 promoter through the two E2F binding sequences. To implicate E2F-1 directly in v-Abl-stimulated transcription, we showed that v-Abl significantly stimulates transcription mediated by GAL4-E2F-1. Our studies indicate that the RB binding domain of E2F-1 is sufficient to confer positive transcriptional regulation by v-Abl. Previous studies by Helin et al. (43Helin K. Harlow E. Fattey A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6501-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) using an E2F-1 protein truncated by a 20-amino acid deletion (417–437) showed no significant effect on E2F-1 transactivation. In contrast, we found that v-Abl does not induce transcription mediated by GAL4-E2F-1 with a larger COOH-terminal 37-amino acid deletion (401–437). This 17-amino acid difference could be critical for E2F-1 transactivation ability, explaining the difference in our results from those of Helin et al. A previous study has shown that deletion of the COOH-terminal region of E2F-1 does not abolish function as a transcriptional activator, suggesting that the NH2-terminal region is not a component of the E2F-1 transactivation domain (43Helin K. Harlow E. Fattey A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6501-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In contrast, this study demonstrates that the E2F-1 COOH-terminal region alone does possess weak transcriptional activation properties which, in the presence of v-Abl, become further activated (Fig. 4). It is possible that this activity occurs in specific cell types and requires the expression of unidentified transactivators that interact with the E2F-1 COOH terminus. In this regard, the ability of v-Abl to recruit binding proteins to E2F complexes has recently been reported (44Wong K.-K. Zou X. Merrell K.T. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Chellappan S. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 12: 6535-6544Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that a GAL4-Abl fusion protein has no transcriptional activation properties. 2M. C. Birchenall-Roberts, Y. D. Yoo, D. C. Bertolette III, K.-H. Lee, J. M. Turley, O.-S. Bang, F. W. Ruscetti, and S.-J. Kim, unpublished data. These results indicate that E2F-mediated transcription is activated by v-Abl. Recently, we have shown that the oncoprotein v-Abl can also activate CREB-mediated transcriptional events (63Birchenall-Roberts M.C. Ruscetti F.W. Kasper J. Bertolette III, D.C. Yoo Y.D. Bang O.-K. Roberts M.S. Turley J.M. Ferris D.K. Kim S.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6088-6099Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), indicating that E2F-1 is not the sole target for v-Abl regulation. Studies to determine whether v-Abl increases E2F binding activity or changes the mobility of E2F complexes were attempted and proved to be difficult to perform. E2F binds DNA tightly so that supershifts with specific E2F-1 antibodies have not been reported, consequently gel shift assays will not distinguish E2F-1 complexes from complexes containing other E2F family members. However, supershift analysis has been used to show the ability of v-Abl to recruit binding proteins to E2F complexes (44Wong K.-K. Zou X. Merrell K.T. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Chellappan S. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 12: 6535-6544Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The E2F family of transcription factors plays a crucial role in cell cycle progression by linking the cell cycle machinery with the transcription apparatus (45DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This activity depends on its ability to bind DNA and activate transcription. E2F transcription factor family members can act as oncogene products (48Singh P. Wong S.H. Hong W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3329-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 49Helin K. Lees J.A.

Morishita et al. (53Morishita R. Gibbons G.H. Horiuchi M. Ellison K.E. Nakajima M. Zhang L. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Dzau V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Previous studies by Renshaw et al. (54Renshaw M.W. Kipreos E.T. Albrecht M.R. Wang Y.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3941-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) support a dual function for v-Abl, as an activator and as a suppressor of cell growth, depending on the cellular context. Inhibition of cell proliferation by c-Abl overexpression in fibroblasts has also been reported (55Wen S.T. Jackson P.K. Van Etten R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Our data show that c-Abl induced E2F-1 transactivation. These seemingly contradictory data, c-Abl-mediated activation of E2F with c-Abl being growth inhibitory (55Wen S.T. Jackson P.K. Van Etten R.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1583-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and, in contrast, v-Abl-mediated activation of E2F with v-Abl being growth stimulatory (presented here and by Wong et al. (44Wong K.-K. Zou X. Merrell K.T. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Chellappan S. Calame K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 12: 6535-6544Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar)), could be explained by as yet unidentified differences that are intrinsic to the nature of the oncogenic v-Abl proteins as well as the cellular environment that interacts with these proteins. Interestingly, the E2F-1 knock-out mice have led to similar conundrums at the organismal level. In the E2F-1−/− mice expressing phenotype (56Field S.J. Tsai F.-Y. Kuo F. Zubiaga A.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Cell. 1996; 85: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), E2F-1 functions to regulate apoptosis and suppress cell proliferation, whereas overexpression studies indicate that E2F-1 stimulates cell proliferation. These results suggest that the actions of a single gene (like E2F-1) are either (i) deterministically dependent upon the cellular environment or (ii) inherently different in its mode of action, perhaps relying on its concentration or other factors that allow for it to behave both as a simulator or as an inhibitor of cellular functions (58Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 457-459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The v-Abl-E2F-1 interaction and transactivation events shown here suggest that a complex system exists for controlling the activity of the E2F transcription factor. This interaction can occur in the absence of RB as demonstrated by our studies in RB−/− cells. Another study with Rb−/− murine fibroblasts showed abnormal S phase entry and activation of E2F-responsive genes (59Almasan A. Yin Y. Kelly R.E. Lee E.Y.H.P. Bradley A. Li W. Bertino J.R. Wahl G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5436-5440Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) despite the presence of p107 and p130, which seem to bind distinctly to other members of the E2F family (31Cobrinik D. Whyte P.

Science. 1988; 241: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Recently, c-Abl has been shown to form a complex with the hypophosphorylated form of RB (14Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J.

Hypophosphorylated RB also binds to a domain in the carboxyl-terminal region of E2F-1 and decreases transcriptional activation of E2F target genes like c-myc (43Helin K. Harlow E. Fattey A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6501-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 62Thalmeier K. Synovzik H. Mertz R. Winnacker E.-L. Lipp M.

Phosphorylation of RB disrupts the interaction between RB and c-Abl, as well as RB and E2F-1. In 32D-abl cells, in addition to binding to E2F-1 as shown here, we have reported recently that the p120-v-Abl protein can bind to RB (37Birchenall-Roberts Kim S.-J. Bertolette III, D.C. Turley J.M. Fu T. Bang O.-K. Kasper J.J. Yoo Y.D. Ruscetti F.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1499-1509PubMed Google Scholar). Both events increase E2F-1 transactivation ability. These findings suggest that these two regulatory pathways are interrelated and may implicate v-Abl-mediated transcriptional activation in v-Abl-driven cellular transformation events. v-Abl transformation leads to significant overexpression of p120-v-Abl, which not only binds E2F-1 but also binds RB, resulting in constitutive activation of E2F-mediated transcription.

Padmanaban G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 16-24Google Scholar, 14Ravishankar H. Padmanaban G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1588-1592Google Scholar, 15Dwarki V.J. Francis V.N.K. Bhat G.J.

This conclusion is based on the fact that inhibitors of heme biosynthesis block induction of CYP2B1/B2 mRNA by PB and its run-on transcription in isolated nuclei. This inhibition is counteracted by the administration of exogenous hemin. In the present study it has been possible to demonstrate that a 65-kDa nuclear protein mediates the positive modulation of CYP2B1/B2 gene transcription by heme. Rats (75-80 g) were injected with PB (8 mg/100 g, intraperitoneal), CoCl2 (6 mg/100 g, subcutaneously), hemin (75 μg/100 g, intraperitoneal), or saline in appropriate combinations. CoCl2 in general was injected 30 min before PB or hemin administration and the rats killed after 5 h. The plasmid pP450e179 containing 360 nt of the CYP2B2 gene and covering positions −179 to +181 nt (3Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sultana S. Vatsala P.G. Padmanaban G. Arch. Biochem Biophys. 1995; 317: 39-45Google Scholar) was used as a template in transcription reactions. pGEM-3Z vector was used to generate riboprobes. Nuclei were obtained from the livers of treated rats using the citric acid homogenization procedure (17Taylor C.W. Yeoman L.C. Dashal I. Busch H. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 82: 215-226Google Scholar). The nuclei were suspended in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM sucrose, and 10 mMβ-mercaptoethanol. NaCl from a stock of 4 M was added drop by drop to a final concentration of 0.45 M and the suspension left on ice for 30 min with intermittent vortexing. The suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant dialyzed against nuclear suspension buffer. Nuclear extract (1-3 μg) was used for binding with the body labeled positive element (5′-GAGGAGTGAATAGCCAAAGCAGGAGGCGTG-3′) covering −98 nt to −69 nt of the CYP2B2 gene annealed to a complementary primer and extended in presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Poly(dI-dC) was used as a competitor and samples were analyzed on low ionic strength 9% polyacrylamide gels as described earlier (4Upadhya P. Rao M.V. Venkateswar V. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 557-562Google Scholar, 5Ram N. Rao M.V. Prabhu L. Nirodi C.S. Sultana S. Vatsala P.G. Padmanaban G. Arch. Biochem Biophys. 1995; 317: 39-45Google Scholar). A stock solution (fresh) of hemin (1 mM) was prepared in 0.1 N NaOH and then adjusted to pH 8.0 with acid. Appropriate dilutions were made with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) using this stock for gel shift and other assays. Approximately 2 μl of hemin solution is usually added to a reaction mixture of 20 μl. Polysomal RNA was isolated from magnesium-precipitated rat liver polysomes using phenol-chloroform extraction procedure (18Palmiter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2095-2106Google Scholar). CYP2B1/B2 mRNA was quantified by RNase protection assay using [α-32P]UTP-labeled I exon riboprobe. The labeled RNA probe was hybridized to 20 μg of polysomal RNA, digested with ribonuclease A and T1, and then analyzed on polyacrylamide-urea gels (8% polyacrylamide) followed by autoradiography (5Ram N. Rao M.V. Prabhu L. Nirodi C.S. Sultana S. Vatsala P.G. Padmanaban G. Arch. Biochem Biophys. 1995; 317: 39-45Google Scholar). This was carried out by the procedure of Guertin et al. (19Guertin M. Baril P. Bartkowiak J. Anderson A. Belanger L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4296-4302Google Scholar) and has been described (3Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3963-3967Google Scholar, 4Upadhya P. Rao M.V. Venkateswar V. Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 557-562Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were incubated with 200 μCi of [α-32P]UTP and other components including human placental RNase inhibitor in a total volume of 200 μl for 30 min at 25°C. The labeled transcripts (107 cpm) were hybridized to filters containing I, VI, and IX exon of the CYP2B2 gene. The riboprobes corresponding to these exons were prepared using pGEM-3Z vector. The filters were washed inclusive of RNase treatment and then subjected to autoradiography. The nuclear extracts prepared for gel shift assays were used after 80% (NH4)2SO4 fractionation. The precipitate was dialyzed against nuclear suspension buffer and used. The reaction in a total volume of 20 μl contained: DNA template (a minigene construct containing −179 nt of the 5′-upstream region and the I exon, pP450e179), 25 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0); 50 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, 0.6 mM each of ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP, glycerol (12% in final concentration), 30 units of RNase inhibitor and transcription extract (50-100 μg of protein/ml). The transcription extract prepared as described was found to be very active and 1–2 μg of protein per 20-μl reaction volume was found adequate. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30°C for 45 min. The RNA transcripts were then isolated after RNase-free DNase and proteinase K treatments followed by phenol/CHCl3 extraction and ethanol precipitation. The transcripts were quantified by the RNase protection method described earlier. Nuclei were prepared from CoCl2-treated rats and the 0.45 M NaCl extract was dialyzed and passed through a heparin-agarose column in buffer containing 50 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 2 mM EDTA. The column was washed with buffer containing 0.3 M NaCl. Further elution was carried out with buffer containing 0.4 M NaCl and then with 0.5 M NaCl. The peak protein fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and used for gel mobility shift assays. The 0.5 M NaCl eluate was further purified on oligoaffinity column. This was prepared by ligating a multimer of the positive element in pUC 19, amplified by polymerase chain reaction, to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (12Prabhu L. Upadhya P. Ram N. Nirodi C.S. Vathsala P.G. Mani S.A. Rangarajan P.N. Surolia A. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9629-9632Google Scholar). The column was washed with the binding buffer (25 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.6), 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol) and eluted with buffer containing 1 M NaCl. This was loaded onto a hemin-agarose column (in the presence of 1 M NaCl), washed thoroughly, and then eluted with 2 M guanidine-HCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The eluate was extensively dialyzed against buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mM EDTA) with repeated changes. The dialysate was concentrated using membrane filters. The purified protein preparation was analyzed on SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and proteins visualized using silver stain. To examine the heme binding property of the purified protein, the preparation was incubated with [59Fe]-hemin (10 μCi/mg, kind gift from National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, with the omission of β-mercaptoethanol and the boiling step. The gel was then subjected to autoradiography. Another approach was to fractionate the protein-hemin complex on a Sepharose 4B column and identify the radioactivity peaks corresponding to protein bound and free hemin. This was basically carried out by pooling up quadruplicates set up for gel shift assays with the 0.5 M NaCl eluate from the heparin-agarose column and the labeled positive element. The mixture was taken in a precooled microtiter plate and irradiated for 15 min on ice with UV light (254 nm, maximum intensity: 7000 uw/cm2) at a distance of 4 cm from the UV source. The sample was then electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and autoradiographed. In another approach the gel shift assay mixture (pooled samples) after UV irradiation was analyzed by electrophoresis on a preparative 9% native polyacrylamide gel as described earlier. The wet gel was exposed to x-ray film overnight at 4°C. Bands (II and III) corresponding to DNA-protein complexes were excised and once again exposed to UV. The complexes were then eluted in Tris-EDTA buffer and precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was thoroughly washed with 70% ethanol, acetone, and ether to remove the acid. The final pellet was analyzed on SDS-PAGE as described earlier. Earlier studies from this laboratory have shown that CoCl2 treatment leads to a striking decrease in the heme pool (13Ravishankar H. Padmanaban G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 16-24Google Scholar, 14Ravishankar H. Padmanaban G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1588-1592Google Scholar, 15Dwarki V.J. Francis V.N.K. Bhat G.J.

The present study has also made use of this reagent to precipitate heme deficiency. Earlier studies on mRNA quantification and run-on transcription were based on filter hybridization and measurement of radioactivity. Here these experiments have been repeated using riboprobes and the sensitive method of RNase protection assay. The results presented in Fig. 1a indicate that PB treatment leads to a striking increase in CYP2B1/B2 mRNA as monitored using the exon I riboprobe. CoCl2 treatment leads to a striking inhibition of PB-mediated induction of CYP2B1/B2 mRNA. Exogenous hemin administration leads to a partial but significant counteraction of the effects of CoCl2. Hemin administration at this concentration has no significant effects when given to saline or PB-treated rats. Administration of CoCl2 to uninduced rats decreases even the basal level of CYP2B1/B2 mRNA and this can be bought back to the basal level by the administration of exogenous hemin (Fig. 1b). The results presented in Fig. 2 indicate that a significant increase in run-on transcription is seen after PB treatment as monitored using exon I, VI, and IX riboprobes. CoCl2 treatment inhibits a PB-mediated increase in the transcription of CYP2B1/B2 gene and hemin administration is able to counteract this effect.Fig. 2Effect of CoCl2 and hemin treatments of the animal on the activation of run-on transcription of CYP2B1B2 gene by phenobarbitone in rat liver. The experimental details are described in text. The riboprobes used are for exon I (201 nt), exon VI (300 nt), exon IX (417 nt), and pBR322. The exon I probe includes 20 nt of the polylinker region. Nuclei were prepared from animals given the following treatments: Lanes 1, control (saline); 2, PB; 3, PB + CoCl2; 4, PB + CoCl2+ hemin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results presented in Fig. 3 indicate that cell-free transcription of pP450e179, the minigene construct containing −179 nt of the 5′-upstream region and exon I, is significantly enhanced after PB treatment of the animal. The basal as well as induced levels of transcription are inhibited by CoCl2 treatment. Hemin administration significantly counteracts the effects of CoCl2 on PB treatment. Studies from this laboratory have shown that the positive element (−69 to −98 nt) generates three complexes (I, II, III) with crude nuclear extract in gel shift assays and PB treatment of the animal leads to a significant intensification of the complexes (4Upadhya P.

It was, therefore, of interest to examine whether CoCl2 treatment would influence binding of nuclear proteins to the positive cis-acting element. The results presented in Fig. 4 reveal that PB treatment leads to a significant increase in the intensity of complexes I, II, and III and this increase in prevented by CoCl2 treatment. Interestingly, hemin administration in vivo restores binding in extracts prepared from CoCl2 as well as PB + CoCl2-treated rats. It does not have a significant effect, when administered to saline or PB-treated rats. The results presented in Fig. 5 (a, b, and c) reveal that addition of hemin in vitro (maximal effect obtained at 10−7M) can also stimulate binding of nuclear extracts prepared from CoCl2-treated rats to the positive cis-acting element. At the level of the crude extract, all three complexes show increased binding to the positive element in the presence of heme. Again, it does not have a significant effect when added to extracts from control (saline) or PB-treated rats. The results presented in Fig. 5 also reveal that the stimulatory effect on binding is specific to hemin addition in vitro and is not shared by equivalent concentrations of protoporphyrin or FeCl3.Fig. 5Effects of hemin, protoporphyrin, and FeCl3 in vitro on the binding of the nuclear proteins with the labeled positive element. The optimal hemin concentration was arrived at after testing the effect at different concentrations. a, nuclear extracts prepared from CoCl2-treated rats were used. To clearly visualize the complexes, 2.5 μg of protein was used. Lanes 1, no addition; 2, hemin (10−7M); 3, protoporphyrin (10−7M); FeCl3 (10−7M). b and c, nuclear extracts from control animals (saline) and PB-treated animals, respectively, were used at 1 μg of protein level. Lanes 1, no addition; 2, hemin (10−7M).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The next step was to purify the heme-responsive protein factor in the nuclear extract. For this purpose, nuclear extracts prepared from CoCl2-treated rats were fractionated on the heparin-agarose column. The results presented in Fig. 6 reveal that hemin addition in vitro specifically stimulates binding of the 0.5 M NaCl eluate from the column to the positive cis-element. Complex II shows a striking response and complex III shows a modest response. The 0.4 M NaCl eluate does not show a heme response in terms of binding. A UV cross-linking analysis of the 0.5 M NaCl eluate gives a clear complex in SDS-PAGE indicating a molecular mass of ∼65 kDa after subtracting the molecular mass of the oligonucleotide used (Fig. 7a). UV cross-linking analysis of complex II as such gives an identical pattern (data not presented). A similar analysis of complex III reveals a lower molecular mass protein in the range 23–26 kDa (Fig. 7b).Fig. 7UV cross-linking analysis of the DNA- protein complex obtained with 0.5 MNaCl eluate of the heparin-agarose column and labeled positive element. The experimental details are given in the text. a, the 0.5 M eluate was used to bind with labeled positive element and the mixture exposed to UV and then analyzed on SDS-PAGE (10% gel). Lanes 1 and 2 are duplicates. b, complex III was specifically eluted after gel shift analysis and UV irradiation. The eluate was then analyzed on SDS-PAGE (10% gel). Lanes 1 and 2, complex III from two different experiments. Preparation 1 had five times more radioactivity than preparation 2; 3, free DNA. The molecular weight markers are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) On this basis, the 0.5 M NaCl eluate was loaded onto a positive element affinity column and the bound proteins were eluted with 1 M NaCl. This was loaded onto the heme affinity column and the bound proteins were eluted with 2 M guanidine HCl. The eluate was extensively dialyzed and SDS-PAGE analysis reveals a single protein band of 65 kDa (Fig. 8). Next, binding studies were carried out with the purified protein and labeled positive element. The preparation shows hardly any binding to the positive element, but in the presence of small amounts of crude nuclear extract (100 ng of protein from uninduced rats), which by itself does not generate easily detectable complexes, manifests a striking heme-responsive increase in the intensity of complex II. Both the purified protein and hemin are required to elicit maximal response. Complex III shows a modest response (Fig. 9 a and b). Qualitatively similar results are obtained when the purified protein is used with nuclear extracts prepared from CoCl2-treated rats (data not presented). Addition of BSA to crude extract does not elicit a similar response, indicating that the heme-dependent increase in binding to the positive element is specific to the 65-kDa protein (Fig. 9c). It is interesting to note that complexes II and III but not complex I are manifest with 0.5 M NaCl-heparin eluate of the CoCl2-treated extract. Once again, complex II shows maximum response with hemin addition, although complex III also manifests some response. In addition, with the heparin column eluate maximum response is seen with 10−9M hemin, whereas the optimal hemin concentration for crude extract as already indicated is 10−7M. The purified ∼65-kDa protein also shows a maximum response around 10−8 to 10−9M hemin concentration for binding to the positive cis-acting element. This depends on the amount and source of crude nuclear extract added, uninduced or CoCl2-treated, along with the 65-kDa protein to elicit the response. It is found that higher concentrations of hemin (10−6 to 10−5M) are inhibitory. Thus, a higher concentration of hemin (10−7M) is tolerated at the level of crude extract, since there are other proteins that may be able to compete for binding. As the protein is purified the competing proteins are removed and therefore the optimum hemin concentration to facilitate maximum binding gets lower.Fig. 9Binding of 65-kDa protein with labeled positive element. The conditions for gel shift assay are described in text. a, effect of 65-kDa protein on binding. Lanes 1, crude extract (100 ng of protein); 2, purified protein (∼2-3 ng); 3, crude extract + purified protein; 4-6, same as 3 plus 10−7, 10−8, or 10−9M hemin added in vitro, respectively. b, repeat experiment in a. Lanes 1, crude extract (100 ng of protein); 2, purified protein (2-3 ng); 3, crude extract+ 10−9M hemin; 4, crude extract + purified protein; 5, crude extract + purified protein + hemin 10−9M. c, effect of BSA on binding. Lanes 1, crude extract (100 ng of protein); 2, crude extract + BSA (1 μg); 3 BSA (1 μg); 4-6, same as 3 plus 10−7, 10−8, or 10−9M hemin, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It was then of interest to examine whether the heme-affinity column purified protein actually binds heme. For this purpose, the preparation was incubated with [59Fe]-labeled hemin and then analyzed on SDS-PAGE, omitting the boiling step and addition of β-mercaptoethanol. A radioactive complex with a mobility of ∼65 kDa is clearly seen on the autoradiogram (Fig. 10) indicating that the protein binds heme. The protein-[59Fe]-labeled hemin complex was also fractionated on a Sepharose 4B column, which indicates that the heme-binding proteins migrates in the region of a BSA standard of mass of 65 kDa (Fig. 10b). Finally, the purified preparation was examined for its potential to manifest heme-responsive stimulation of the transcription of pP450e179 DNA in cell-free extracts. For this purpose, the crude transcription extract was prepared from nuclei of CoCl2-treated rats. The results presented in Fig. 11 (a and b) on the basis of laser densitometric analysis reveal that addition of hemin (10−8M) or the purified protein (2 μg) to the transcription extract shows about 3- and 4–5-fold stimulation of transcription, respectively. The addition of the two together shows nearly 12-fold stimulation (Fig. 11a). There is also a significant graded response to the addition of increasing concentrations of the purified protein in the presence of hemin (Fig. 11b). The present study clearly reveals that CoCl2 treatment leads to a striking inhibition of CYP2B/B2 gene transcription that is overcome by the administration of low concentrations of hemin. The basal (uninduced) as well as PB-induced CYP2B1/B2 mRNA levels are also depressed by CoCl2 treatment and counteracted by hemin administration (Fig. 1). Run-on and cell-free transcription studies indicate that CoCl2 inhibits the PB-mediated increase in transcription and this is counteracted by the administration of exogenous hemin (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). Cell-free transcription studies have indicated that the heme response element is within the 179 nt of the immediate 5′-upstream region of the CYP2B1/B2 gene. Gel shift analysis with the positive element (−69 to −98 nt) correlates well with the inhibitory and counteracting effects of CoCl2 and hemin, respectively, on CYP2B1/B2 mRNA levels and transcription status.

Mani S.A. Rangarajan P.N. Surolia A. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9629-9632Google Scholar) crude nuclear extract gives three complexes (I, II, and III) with the positive element. The present study reveals that CoCl2 treatment leads to a suppression of formation of all the three complexes both in the presence and absence of PB treatment. At the level of the crude nuclear extract isolated from CoCl2-treated rats, all the three complexes intensify on hemin addition (Fig. 4). The effect is specific for hemin, since protoporphyrin or iron fail to elicit a similar effect (Fig. 5). After fractionation on the heparin-agarose column, with the 0.5 M NaCl eluate, complex II shows a striking increase in intensity to hemin addition and complex III shows a modest increase in intensity (Fig. 6). UV cross-linking analysis indicates that complex III consists of the ∼26-kDa protein (Fig. 7). This is in agreement with the results reported from this laboratory (12Prabhu L. Upadhya P. Ram N. Nirodi C.S. Vathsala P.G. Mani S.A. Rangarajan P.N. Surolia A. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9629-9632Google Scholar), where the ∼26-kDa protein purified from the 0.4 M NaCl eluate of the heparin-agarose column on the positive element oligonucleotide affinity column, has been shown to give rise to complex III with the positive element in gel shift analysis. The complex is faint, but in the presence of low amounts of crude nuclear extract or on concentrations of the purified fraction all the three complexes (I, II, and III) are manifest. The present study also reveals that complex II consists of the ∼65-kDa protein, although traces of lower molecular weight proteins are also seen on UV cross-linking analysis. This is corraborated by the findings that the 0.5 M NaCl eluate of the CoCl2-treated nuclear extracts from the heparin-agarose column gives a striking response to hemin addition in terms of generating complex II with the positive element (Fig. 6) and that a ∼65-kDa heme-binding protein can be purified from this fraction using oligonucleotide and heme affinity columns (Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10). As already indicated, the 0.5 M NaCl eluate from the heparin column also manifests heme-dependent generation of complex III, although complex II is dominant. It may be pointed that traces of low molecular mass proteins can be seen in the purified 65-kDa preparation. Once again binding of the purified ∼65-kDa protein to the positive element is very poor and significant binding in the presence of hemin to the element is seen when small amounts of crude nuclear extract are added (Fig. 9). Thus, protein-protein interaction is essential for the binding of ∼26- and ∼65-kDa proteins to the positive element. UV cross-linking analysis of complexes II and III perhaps reveal only the proteins that make primary contact with positive elements and the other proteins involved in protein-protein interaction need to be identified. In a recent study, it has been shown in this laboratory (12Prabhu L. Upadhya P. Ram N. Nirodi C.S. Vathsala P.G. Mani S.A. Rangarajan P.N. Surolia A. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9629-9632Google Scholar) that the ∼26-kDa protein shows greater affinity to the positive (−69 to −98 nt) and negative (−126 to −166 nt) elements in its phosphorylated and dephosphorylated states, respectively, providing a basis for a differential interaction of the protein with the two elements in induced and uninduced states. While, the role of heme in the interaction of proteins to negative element is yet to be investigated, it is clear that interaction of the ∼65-kDa protein with the positive element is heme dependent. Since, heme depletion leads to a decrease in basal as well as PB-induced transcription of the CYP2B1/B2 gene that is counteracted by the exogenous administration of hemin, it can be concluded that heme requirement is constitutive. Earlier studies from this laboratory (3Rangarajan P.N. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3963-3967Google Scholar) have shown by Southwestern blot analysis that a ∼94-kDa protein shows up when the entire 179 nt of the 5′-upstream region of the CYP2B1/B2 gene is used as a probe. PB treatment significantly enhances the intensity of this complex and this increase is blocked by CoCl2 treatment of the animal. Thus, there are at least three proteins with molecular mass values of ∼94, ∼65, and ∼26 kDa, whose interaction with the positive element and its neighborhood is influenced by the availability of heme and this in turn may influence the interaction of this protein assembly with the far upstream enhancer proposed by Ramsden et al. (11Ramsden R. Sommer K.M. Omiecinski C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21722-21726Google Scholar) as well as the initiation complex, leading to productive transcription of the CYP2B1/B2 gene. The ∼65-kDa protein is perhaps the dominant protein that interacts with heme and facilitates interaction with other proteins and positive element. It needs to be studied whether heme has a direct role in the interaction of the ∼26- and ∼94-kDa proteins with cis-acting DNA elements. Fig. 12 depicts the model envisaged for the heme-dependent interaction of the proteins with the positive element. The ∼26-kDa protein has already been shown to stimulate transcription of the minigene construct containing the positive element (pP450e179) in cell-free extracts (12Prabhu L. Upadhya P. Ram N. Nirodi C.S. Vathsala P.G. Mani S.A. Rangarajan P.N. Surolia A. Padmanaban G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9629-9632Google Scholar). In the present study, the ∼65-kDa protein has been shown to stimulate transcription of the pP450e179 DNA in cell-free extracts prepared from CoCl2-treated rat liver nuclei in a heme dependent fashion. It, therefore, appears likely that the two proteins are positive regulators of the gene with binding sites on the positive element, although the possible interaction between the two needs to be studied."

INTRODUCTIONThe process of transcribing a gene can be divided into three main functional steps: initiation, elongation, and termination of transcription. For the eukaryotic ribosomal genes, transcribed by RNA polymerase I (pol I), 1The abbreviations used are: polRNA polymerasebpbase pair(s)ntnucleotide(s) the cis-acting DNA elements comprising the promoter and the terminator have been identified for several species from yeast to man, and trans-acting protein factors required for transcription initiation and termination have been purified and in many cases molecularly cloned (1Reeder R.H.

A. 1995; 92: 5827-5831Google Scholar). On the other hand, relatively little is known about the process of transcription elongation by pol I. Due to the considerable length of the ribosomal genes and in light of the finding that at least some pol I even transcribe through the entire intergenic spacer (6Labhart P. Reeder R.H. Cell. 1986; 45: 431-443Google Scholar), elongation of pol I transcription is likely to be an important process and can be expected to be regulated as well. Indeed, a previous study with Xenopus oocytes provided evidence that there are two types of ribosomal gene transcription, which differ in their elongation characteristics (7Labhart P. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 409-423Google Scholar). The only pol I elongation factor identified to date is TIF-IC, a mouse pol I transcription factor that is involved in both initiation and elongation (8Schnapp G. Schnapp A. Rosenbauer H. Grummt I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4028-4035Google Scholar).Much more is known about transcription elongation by pol II, and several protein factors affecting different steps of the elongation process have been identified. TFIIF and SIII, for example, stimulate the rate of elongation (9Bengal E. Flores O. Krauskopf A. Reinberg D. Aloni Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1195-1206Google Scholar, 10Bradsher J.N. Tan S. McLaury H.-J. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25594-25603Google Scholar), whereas TFIIS (SII) promotes read-through of pol II at arrest or pause sites on the template (11Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Google Scholar). Others, like TFIIH and TFIIE, are required for promoter escape, an early step in elongation (12Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Google Scholar). The present study is concerned with TFIIS and TFIIS-like factors. cDNAs encoding TFIIS have been isolated from various species, including Xenopus (Refs. 13Kugawa F. Shinga J. Imagawa M. Arae K. Nagano M. Shibata M. Shiokawa K. Aoki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 541-546Google Scholar and 14Plant K.E. Hair A. Morgan G.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3514-3521Google Scholar, and this study). TFIIS binds to pol II in the elongation complex and activates an intrinsic RNase activity that shortens the nascent transcript from the 3′-end (15Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Google Scholar, 16Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Google Scholar) (reviewed in 17Kassavetic G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1993; 259: 944-945Google Scholar). The transcript cleavage is a hydrolytic reaction and liberates mono- and/or short oligonucleotides depending on the conformation and location of the paused elongation complex (18Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Google Scholar, 19Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30441-30447Google Scholar). The shortened transcript can be reextended in the presence of NTPs indicating that the 3′-ends of the shortened transcripts are still associated with the catalytic site of pol II. It is thought that RNA cleavage is important for the observed activation of read-through by TFIIS possibly by allowing the arrested elongation complex to make several attempts to overcome an obstacle. Whether these in vitro observations reflect the in vivo role of TFIIS is an unresolved question. In yeast, TFIIS is not essential for viability, but cells lacking TFIIS are sensitive toward 6-azauracil (20Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Google Scholar, 21Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Google Scholar).TFIIS is generally considered to be specific for pol II. Thus, TFIIS purified from mouse cells did not affect pol I in nonspecific transcription assays (22Sekimizu K. Kobayashi N. Mizuno D. Natori S. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5064-5070Google Scholar), and in a different study TFIIS was found to bind to pol II but not to pol III (23Reinberg D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3331-3337Google Scholar). However, another early paper reported that partially purified yeast TFIIS stimulated both pol I and pol II (24Sawadogo M. Lescure B. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3542-3547Google Scholar). The question of the pol specificity of TFIIS has not been reinvestigated by looking at the more defined effects of TFIIS on paused elongation complexes. In search of pol I-specific elongation factors, I tested whether evidence for an involvement of TFIIS or a TFIIS-like factor in transcription by pol I could be obtained. I used the cleavage of nascent transcripts in a stalled pol I elongation complex as an assay for such a factor. My results show that there is indeed an activity associated with pol I ternary complexes that has similar functional characteristics as TFIIS but is distinct from TFIIS.DISCUSSIONTFIIS is a transcription factor that was originally identified as an activity that stimulates nonspecific transcription by purified pol II (34Natori S. Takeuchi K. Takahashi K. Mizuno D. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1973; 73: 879-888Google Scholar). It was later classified as an elongation factor because it suppresses pausing and increases the yield of long transcripts in specific transcription reactions (23Reinberg D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3331-3337Google Scholar, 35Rappaport J. Reinberg D. Zandomeni R. Weinmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5227-5232Google Scholar). TFIIS exerts its function in elongation by helping stalled or arrested pol II to read through various transcriptional blockages (11Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Google Scholar, 36Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Google Scholar, 37Reines D. Mote Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1917-1921Google Scholar). In stalled and arrested elongation complexes, TFIIS stimulates the cleavage of the nascent transcripts at the 3′-end and a concomitant backward movement of the catalytic site of pol II (15Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Google Scholar, 16Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Google Scholar). This cleavage reaction is thought to be important or even required for efficient read-through at these arrest sites.It is reasonable to postulate that the transcription of ribosomal genes also requires an elongation factor. As discussed in the Introduction, the available data appeared insufficient to fully rule out that TFIIS itself would also serve as an elongation factor for pol I. The stimulation of the pol-associated transcript cleavage activity is a more diagnostic assay for TFIIS than the stimulation of nonspecific transcription. I therefore investigated whether TFIIS would stimulate the cleavage of nascent transcripts in a stalled pol I elongation complex. My data show that recombinant Xenopus TFIIS, when added to Sarkosyl-washed pol I elongation complexes that stalled after transcription of a 52-nt RNA, did not stimulate cleavage of this transcript. This negative result was substantiated by control experiments with Sarkosyl-washed pol II elongation complexes, where the expected effects of Xenopus TFIIS were readily detected. Furthermore, Xenopus TFIIS showed all the known characteristics in these pol II controls, like Mg2+ dependence, α-amanitin sensitivity, and dependence on the zinc ribbon domain near its C terminus.Whereas the present results make an involvement of TFIIS in pol I transcription very unlikely, they also show that a different activity that is similar to TFIIS is present in the pol I elongation complex. Like TFIIS, this activity shortens the nascent RNA from the 3′-end releasing mono- and dinucleotides. The shortened transcripts are still associated with the catalytic site of pol I, since they are readily reextended upon addition of the appropriate NTPs. Finally, the cleavage activity is removed from the pol I elongation complex with 0.1-0.25% Sarkosyl; the same conditions also remove TFIIS from the pol II elongation complex (38Wiest D.K. Wang D. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7733-7744Google Scholar). Unlike the TFIIS-induced RNA cleavage reaction in pol II ternary complexes, the pol I-associated cleavage reaction is resistant to high concentrations of α-amanitin, a finding that is consistent with an involvement of the catalytic site of pol I in the transcript shortening.In stalled or arrested pol II elongation complexes a low level of RNA cleavage is taking place even in the absence of an auxiliary factor like TFIIS, indicating that the nucleolytic activity resides in pol II (15Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Google Scholar, 16Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Google Scholar, 17Kassavetic G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1993; 259: 944-945Google Scholar, 39Wang D. Hawley D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 843-847Google Scholar). For pol III this type of hydrolytic cleavage is the only type that has been observed so far, and a TFIIS-like, dissociable activity like the one described in this study has not been identified in pol III complexes (30Whitehall S.K. Bardeleben C. Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2299-2306Google Scholar). In the present experiments I did not detect an intrinsic activity of pol I that would be active without an auxiliary factor. It can be expected, however, that pol I by itself would also show some nucleolytic activity if the sensitivity of the assay was increased. In any case, it is clear that for both pol II and pol I, TFIIS or a TFIIS-like factor is required for efficient transcript cleavage.After submission of the original version of this manuscript, the identification of a yeast activity that shortens nascent pol I transcripts from the 3′-end was reported (40Tschochner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12914-12919Google Scholar). Whereas this yeast factor and the present Xenopus activity clearly seem to be related, the available data are insufficient to decide whether they represent homologous protein factors. It will be interesting to determine the Mg2+ requirement and the Sarkosyl sensitivity of the yeast factor as well as the size of the liberated cleavage products. Apparent differences lie in the chromatographic behavior and in the finding that the yeast activity can be detected even in the presence of nucleotides.Sequences encoding Xenopus TFIIS were recently reported by Kugawa et al. (13Kugawa F. Shinga J. Imagawa M. Arae K. Nagano M. Shibata M. Shiokawa K. Aoki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 541-546Google Scholar) and Plant et al. (14Plant K.E. Hair A. Morgan G.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3514-3521Google Scholar). The latter paper identified two genes for Xenopus TFIIS, termed xTFIIS.oA and xTFIIS.oB, which were interpreted to represent the two gene copies present in the two homologous genomes of the tetraploid Xenopus laevis The two predicted proteins are 91% identical. The deduced protein sequence reported by Kugawa et al. (13Kugawa F. Shinga J. Imagawa M. Arae K. Nagano M. Shibata M. Shiokawa K. Aoki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 541-546Google Scholar) is 100% identical to xTFIIS.oA Interestingly, the sequence of the cDNA isolated for the present study, which I will refer to as xTFIIS.l, is very different from both xTFIIS.oA and xTFIIS.oB (Fig. 6). The predicted xTFIIS.l and xTFIIS.oA/B proteins are only 68-70% identical in the 82-amino acid long N-terminal domain and 72-74% identical in the 175-amino acid C-terminal domain. The regions between these two domains are not conserved and of different lengths (46 versus 35 amino acids). The similarity between these two Xenopus proteins is thus about the same as between TFIIS from different vertebrate species. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, I found that mRNAs encoding xTFIIS.oA/B and xTFIIS.l are both expressed in a Xenopus tissue culture cell line. 2P. Labhart, unpublished results. Xenopus thus has two highly divergent forms of TFIIS, which do not appear to reflect the duplication of its genome during evolution. This finding has a precedent in mammalian species, where in addition to the general form of TFIIS a testis-specific type was identified (41Xu Q. Nakanishi T. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3100-3103Google Scholar, 42Umehara T. Kida S. Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 297-302Google Scholar).It will be interesting to see whether the present TFIIS-like factor belongs to the TFIIS family of proteins. In addition, it will be important to investigate whether and how it changes the properties of the pol I elongation complex. The experiment shown in Fig. 2 shows that in the presence of NTPs a pol I elongation complex is able to elongate to the end of the template regardless of whether it contains this factor (lanes 4 and 11). Furthermore, on the template that was used no intrinsic arrest or pause sites were uncovered during elongation of Sarkosyl-washed complexes. The purification and cloning of this factor will be necessary to investigate its role, if any, in transcription elongation by pol I.

The present study is concerned with TFIIS and TFIIS-like factors. cDNAs encoding TFIIS have been isolated from various species, including Xenopus (Refs. 13Kugawa F. Shinga J. Imagawa M. Arae K. Nagano M. Shibata M. Shiokawa K. Aoki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 541-546Google Scholar and 14Plant K.E. Hair A. Morgan G.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3514-3521Google Scholar, and this study). TFIIS binds to pol II in the elongation complex and activates an intrinsic RNase activity that shortens the nascent transcript from the 3′-end (15Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Google Scholar, 16Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Google Scholar) (reviewed in 17Kassavetic G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1993; 259: 944-945Google Scholar). The transcript cleavage is a hydrolytic reaction and liberates mono- and/or short oligonucleotides depending on the conformation and location of the paused elongation complex (18Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Google Scholar, 19Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30441-30447Google Scholar). The shortened transcript can be reextended in the presence of NTPs indicating that the 3′-ends of the shortened transcripts are still associated with the catalytic site of pol II. It is thought that RNA cleavage is important for the observed activation of read-through by TFIIS possibly by allowing the arrested elongation complex to make several attempts to overcome an obstacle. Whether these in vitro observations reflect the in vivo role of TFIIS is an unresolved question. In yeast, TFIIS is not essential for viability, but cells lacking TFIIS are sensitive toward 6-azauracil (20Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Google Scholar, 21Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Google Scholar). TFIIS is generally considered to be specific for pol II. Thus, TFIIS purified from mouse cells did not affect pol I in nonspecific transcription assays (22Sekimizu K. Kobayashi N. Mizuno D. Natori S. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5064-5070Google Scholar), and in a different study TFIIS was found to bind to pol II but not to pol III (23Reinberg D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3331-3337Google Scholar). However, another early paper reported that partially purified yeast TFIIS stimulated both pol I and pol II (24Sawadogo M. Lescure B. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3542-3547Google Scholar). The question of the pol specificity of TFIIS has not been reinvestigated by looking at the more defined effects of TFIIS on paused elongation complexes. In search of pol I-specific elongation factors, I tested whether evidence for an involvement of TFIIS or a TFIIS-like factor in transcription by pol I could be obtained. I used the cleavage of nascent transcripts in a stalled pol I elongation complex as an assay for such a factor. My results show that there is indeed an activity associated with pol I ternary complexes that has similar functional characteristics as TFIIS but is distinct from TFIIS. DISCUSSIONTFIIS is a transcription factor that was originally identified as an activity that stimulates nonspecific transcription by purified pol II (34Natori S. Takeuchi K. Takahashi K. Mizuno D. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1973; 73: 879-888Google Scholar). It was later classified as an elongation factor because it suppresses pausing and increases the yield of long transcripts in specific transcription reactions (23Reinberg D. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3331-3337Google Scholar, 35Rappaport J. Reinberg D. Zandomeni R. Weinmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5227-5232Google Scholar). TFIIS exerts its function in elongation by helping stalled or arrested pol II to read through various transcriptional blockages (11Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Google Scholar, 36Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Google Scholar, 37Reines D. Mote Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1917-1921Google Scholar). In stalled and arrested elongation complexes, TFIIS stimulates the cleavage of the nascent transcripts at the 3′-end and a concomitant backward movement of the catalytic site of pol II (15Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Google Scholar, 16Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Google Scholar). This cleavage reaction is thought to be important or even required for efficient read-through at these arrest sites.It is reasonable to postulate that the transcription of ribosomal genes also requires an elongation factor. As discussed in the Introduction, the available data appeared insufficient to fully rule out that TFIIS itself would also serve as an elongation factor for pol I. The stimulation of the pol-associated transcript cleavage activity is a more diagnostic assay for TFIIS than the stimulation of nonspecific transcription. I therefore investigated whether TFIIS would stimulate the cleavage of nascent transcripts in a stalled pol I elongation complex. My data show that recombinant Xenopus TFIIS, when added to Sarkosyl-washed pol I elongation complexes that stalled after transcription of a 52-nt RNA, did not stimulate cleavage of this transcript. This negative result was substantiated by control experiments with Sarkosyl-washed pol II elongation complexes, where the expected effects of Xenopus TFIIS were readily detected. Furthermore, Xenopus TFIIS showed all the known characteristics in these pol II controls, like Mg2+ dependence, α-amanitin sensitivity, and dependence on the zinc ribbon domain near its C terminus.Whereas the present results make an involvement of TFIIS in pol I transcription very unlikely, they also show that a different activity that is similar to TFIIS is present in the pol I elongation complex. Like TFIIS, this activity shortens the nascent RNA from the 3′-end releasing mono- and dinucleotides. The shortened transcripts are still associated with the catalytic site of pol I, since they are readily reextended upon addition of the appropriate NTPs. Finally, the cleavage activity is removed from the pol I elongation complex with 0.1-0.25% Sarkosyl; the same conditions also remove TFIIS from the pol II elongation complex (38Wiest D.K. Wang D. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7733-7744Google Scholar). Unlike the TFIIS-induced RNA cleavage reaction in pol II ternary complexes, the pol I-associated cleavage reaction is resistant to high concentrations of α-amanitin, a finding that is consistent with an involvement of the catalytic site of pol I in the transcript shortening.In stalled or arrested pol II elongation complexes a low level of RNA cleavage is taking place even in the absence of an auxiliary factor like TFIIS, indicating that the nucleolytic activity resides in pol II (15Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Google Scholar, 16Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Google Scholar, 17Kassavetic G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Science. 1993; 259: 944-945Google Scholar, 39Wang D. Hawley D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 843-847Google Scholar). For pol III this type of hydrolytic cleavage is the only type that has been observed so far, and a TFIIS-like, dissociable activity like the one described in this study has not been identified in pol III complexes (30Whitehall S.K. Bardeleben C. Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2299-2306Google Scholar). In the present experiments I did not detect an intrinsic activity of pol I that would be active without an auxiliary factor. It can be expected, however, that pol I by itself would also show some nucleolytic activity if the sensitivity of the assay was increased. In any case, it is clear that for both pol II and pol I, TFIIS or a TFIIS-like factor is required for efficient transcript cleavage.After submission of the original version of this manuscript, the identification of a yeast activity that shortens nascent pol I transcripts from the 3′-end was reported (40Tschochner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12914-12919Google Scholar). Whereas this yeast factor and the present Xenopus activity clearly seem to be related, the available data are insufficient to decide whether they represent homologous protein factors. It will be interesting to determine the Mg2+ requirement and the Sarkosyl sensitivity of the yeast factor as well as the size of the liberated cleavage products. Apparent differences lie in the chromatographic behavior and in the finding that the yeast activity can be detected even in the presence of nucleotides.Sequences encoding Xenopus TFIIS were recently reported by Kugawa et al. (13Kugawa F. Shinga J. Imagawa M. Arae K. Nagano M. Shibata M. Shiokawa K. Aoki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 541-546Google Scholar) and Plant et al. (14Plant K.E. Hair A. Morgan G.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3514-3521Google Scholar). The latter paper identified two genes for Xenopus TFIIS, termed xTFIIS.oA and xTFIIS.oB, which were interpreted to represent the two gene copies present in the two homologous genomes of the tetraploid Xenopus laevis The two predicted proteins are 91% identical. The deduced protein sequence reported by Kugawa et al. (13Kugawa F. Shinga J. Imagawa M. Arae K. Nagano M. Shibata M. Shiokawa K. Aoki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 541-546Google Scholar) is 100% identical to xTFIIS.oA Interestingly, the sequence of the cDNA isolated for the present study, which I will refer to as xTFIIS.l, is very different from both xTFIIS.oA and xTFIIS.oB (Fig. 6). The predicted xTFIIS.l and xTFIIS.oA/B proteins are only 68-70% identical in the 82-amino acid long N-terminal domain and 72-74% identical in the 175-amino acid C-terminal domain. The regions between these two domains are not conserved and of different lengths (46 versus 35 amino acids). The similarity between these two Xenopus proteins is thus about the same as between TFIIS from different vertebrate species. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, I found that mRNAs encoding xTFIIS.oA/B and xTFIIS.l are both expressed in a Xenopus tissue culture cell line. 2P. Labhart, unpublished results. Xenopus thus has two highly divergent forms of TFIIS, which do not appear to reflect the duplication of its genome during evolution. This finding has a precedent in mammalian species, where in addition to the general form of TFIIS a testis-specific type was identified (41Xu Q. Nakanishi T. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3100-3103Google Scholar, 42Umehara T. Kida S. Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 297-302Google Scholar).It will be interesting to see whether the present TFIIS-like factor belongs to the TFIIS family of proteins. In addition, it will be important to investigate whether and how it changes the properties of the pol I elongation complex. The experiment shown in Fig. 2 shows that in the presence of NTPs a pol I elongation complex is able to elongate to the end of the template regardless of whether it contains this factor (lanes 4 and 11). Furthermore, on the template that was used no intrinsic arrest or pause sites were uncovered during elongation of Sarkosyl-washed complexes. The purification and cloning of this factor will be necessary to investigate its role, if any, in transcription elongation by pol I. TFIIS is a transcription factor that was originally identified as an activity that stimulates nonspecific transcription by purified pol II (34Natori S. Takeuchi K. Takahashi K. Mizuno D. J. Biochem.

In stalled and arrested elongation complexes, TFIIS stimulates the cleavage of the nascent transcripts at the 3′-end and a concomitant backward movement of the catalytic site of pol II (15Reines D.

The ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was released from transformed NMU cells by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and hence glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored, whereas the NAD glycohydrolase (NADase) activity remained cell-associated. By gel permeation chromatography, the size of the PI-PLC-released transferase was ∼40 kDa and that of the detergent-solubilized NADase was ∼100 kDa. Using polyclonal antibodies against rabbit muscle transferase on Western blots, ∼18- and ∼30-kDa band were visualized among proteins from the NADase fractions and 38–40-kDa bands with protein from the transferase fractions. Incubation of blots with [32P]NAD led to the incorporation of radioactivity into the immunoreactive transferase bands of 38 kDa and the immunoreactive NADase band of ∼18 kDa.

For example, cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates an arginine in the α-subunit of the stimulatory heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein, resulting in the activation of adenylyl cyclase and an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP (4Moss J.

Based on studies in which the transferase cDNAs were transfected into mammalian cells, it appears that skeletal muscle and mouse lymphocyte enzymes are extracellular glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins (9Okazaki I.J. Zolkiewska A. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12828-12836Google Scholar, 13Okazaki I.J. Kim H.-J. McElvaney G. Lesma E. Moss J. Blood. 1996; 88: 915-921Google Scholar). Consistent with its extracellular location, the GPI-linked muscle transferase ADP-ribosylates integrin α7 on cultured mouse myotubes (15Zolkiewska A. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25273-25276Google Scholar); inhibitor studies suggest that the muscle transferase may participate in the regulation of myogenesis (16Kharadia S.V. Huiatt T.W. Huang H.-Y. Peterson J.E. Graves D.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 201: 33-42Google Scholar). mouse T cell lymphoma cells rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells glycosylphosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C phosphate-buffered saline polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase dithiothreitol transformant lacking amino- and carboxyl-terminal signal sequences transformant lacking the amino-terminal signal sequence transformant lacking the carboxyl-terminal signal sequence transformant lacking the amino-terminal 121 amino acids of Yac-1 endoplasmic reticulum In murine cytotoxic T cells, ADP-ribosylation of a 40-kDa surface protein (p40) was associated with the inhibition of p56lck tyrosine kinase, which exists in a complex with p40, and suppression of cytotoxic T cell proliferation and cytotoxic activity (17Wang J. Nemoto E. Kots A.Y. Kaslow H.R. Dennert G. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4048-4058Google Scholar, 18Wang J. Nemoto E. Dennert G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2819-2827Google Scholar). The ADP-ribosyltransferase involved in this reaction has not been identified although candidate genes have been identified, including Yac-1. A second ADP-ribosyltransferase (Yac-2) was cloned and characterized from mouse lymphoma cells (14Okazaki I.J. Kim H.-J. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22052-22057Google Scholar). In contrast to the muscle and Yac-1 transferases, the Yac-2 enzyme although membrane-bound is apparently not GPI-anchored and exhibits significant basal NAD glycohydrolase activity (14Okazaki I.J. Kim H.-J. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22052-22057Google Scholar). Based on the PI-PLC sensitivity of the cytotoxic T cell transferase, Yac-2 may not be responsible for the activity. Structural analysis of bacterial toxin ADP-ribosyltransferases has demonstrated three regions of similarity (regions I, II, and III) that are believed to form part of the active site (19Domenighini M. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 667-674Google Scholar). For some of the toxins, region I contains a critical histidine or arginine (20Lobet Y. Cluff C.W. Cieplak Jr., W. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2870-2879Google Scholar–22Johnson V.G. Nicholls P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4349-4354Google Scholar); region II is composed of closely spaced aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids (23Carroll S.F. Collier R.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 293-296Google Scholar, 24Rappuoli R. Pizza M. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 1-21Google Scholar); region III contains a catalytic glutamic acid (20Lobet Y. Cluff C.W. Cieplak Jr., W. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2870-2879Google Scholar, 21Blanke S.R.

A. 1985; 82: 7237-7241Google Scholar–30Antoine R. Locht C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6450-6457Google Scholar). In other toxins, a serine replaces the region II domain (24Rappuoli R. Pizza M. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 1-21Google Scholar). Similar to findings with the bacterial toxins, site-directed mutagenesis of the rabbit muscle transferase identified glutamates 238 and 240 in the putative region III as essential for enzyme activity (31Takada T. Iida K. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 541-544Google Scholar). These data, along with the alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the cloned vertebrate transferases, are consistent with the hypothesis that the enzymes have a common mechanism of NAD binding and catalysis. The muscle and lymphocyte ADP-ribosyltransferases catalyze the ADP-ribosylation of arginine, agmatine, and other simple guanidino compounds (8Zolkiewska A. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11352-11356Google Scholar, 9Okazaki I.J. Zolkiewska A. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12828-12836Google Scholar, 10Tsuchiya M. Hara N. Yamada K. Osago H.

The NAD glycohydrolase activity of these enzymes is only a small percentage of maximal transferase activity in the presence of optimal concentrations of guanidino compounds as ADP-ribose acceptors. We report here that rat mammary adenocarcinoma (NMU) cells transformed with the rabbit skeletal muscle ADP-ribosyltransferase cDNA expressed significant NAD glycohydrolase as well as transferase activity. Membrane-bound NAD glycohydrolase activity was associated with a 100-kDa protein, an apparent oligomer of a proteolytic fragment of the transferase, and a truncated form of the transferase, synthesized in Escherichia coli, exhibited NADase activity. NMU (rat mammary adenocarcinoma) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection; Eagle's minimal essential medium and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline were from BioWhittaker; Geneticin (G418) was from Life Technologies, Inc.; dexamethasone sodium phosphate was from MG Scientific; NheI, XhoI, and KspI restriction endonucleases and PCR Master kit were from Boehringer Mannheim; Qiagen plasmid extraction kit from Qiagen; β-NAD, agmatine, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin were from Sigma; [adenine-U-14C]NAD (241 mCi/mmol), [carbonyl-14C]NAD (53 mCi/mmol), and enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents were from Amersham; [adenylate-32P]NAD (30 Ci/mmol) was from DuPont NEN; nitrocellulose membrane and Dowex AG 1-X2 resin were from Bio-Rad; Ultrogel AcA 44 was from Biosepra; bicinchoninic acid protein reagent was from Pierce; and glutathione-Sepharose 4B was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Wild-type mouse lymphocyte (Yac-1) and rabbit muscle transferase cDNAs were subcloned into the pMAMneo mammalian expression vector as described (13Okazaki I.J. Kim H.-J. McElvaney G. Lesma E. Moss J. Blood. 1996; 88: 915-921Google Scholar, 31Takada T. Iida K. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 541-544Google Scholar). Truncated rabbit muscle transferase cDNAs were generated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques (32Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The pM5′3′T clone, lacking 23 and 24 amino acids from the amino and carboxyl termini, respectively, was amplified from the wild-type rabbit muscle transferase cDNA (100 ng) in a 100-μl reaction containing dNTPs (each 0.2 mM), Taq DNA polymerase (2.5 units), and forward (5′-ACGTACGTACGTGCTAGCATGAGCCACCTGGTCACACGTCGAGAC-3′) and reverse (5′-ACGTACGTACGTCTCGAGTCAGGAGAGGCGCTCCTGAGCCGAGGC-3′) primers (100 pmol each). Amplification was performed for 30 cycles of 94°C, 1 min/55°C, 1 min/72°C, 1.5 min, followed by a 7-min extension at 72°C. The pM5′T clone, which lacks the amino-terminal 23 amino acids, was amplified by PCR from the muscle transferase cDNA using forward (5′-ACGTACGTACGTGCTAGCATGAGCCACCTGGTCACACGTCGAGAC-3′) and reverse (5′-ACGTACGTACGTCTCGAGTCAGAAGAGGCCTGGGCTTCCTGG-3′) primers (100 pmol each) and conditions identical to those described above. The truncated pM3′T clone, which lacks the carboxyl-terminal 24 amino acids, was generated using forward (5′-ACGTACGTACGTGCTAGCATGTGGGTTCCTGCCGTGGCGAAT-3′) and reverse (5′-ACGTACGTACGTCTCGAGTCAGGAGAGGCGCTCCTGAGCCGAGGC-3′) primers (100 pmol each). PCR products were purified, digested with NheI and XhoI, and subcloned into the pMAMneo vector. NMU cells were transfected with 15 μg of the pMAMneo vector (control) or vector containing the full-length or truncated transferase cDNAs using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (33Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. I. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990: 9.1.1-9.1.9Google Scholar), and stable transformants were selected with Geneticin (0.5 mg/ml). Following induction of protein expression with dexamethasone (1 μM) for 24 h, cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 60 min in PBS (0.7 ml) with or without phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC, 0.5 unit). After collecting the PBS fraction, the cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) by repeated freeze-thawing. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h) of the lysate, the supernatant (Supernatant, 0.5 ml) was collected and the membranes (Pellet) were suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. NMU cells transformed with wild-type Yac-1 or rabbit muscle transferase cDNAs were incubated in PBS without or with PI-PLC as described above. The PBS fraction was applied to a column (2 × 120 cm) of Ultrogel AcA 44, equilibrated with buffer A (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). Samples of the eluate were assayed for transferase activity (Fig. 1A). Membranes from the transformed NMU cells were suspended in buffer A, stirred for 18 h at 4°C, and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h). The supernatant was applied to a column (2 × 120 cm) of Ultrogel AcA 44, equilibrated, and eluted with buffer A. Samples of fractions were assayed for NAD glycohydrolase activity (Fig. 1B). Fractions containing maximal activity were pooled and used for activity measurements. Proteins in fractions from gel filtration that contained ADP-ribosyltransferase or NAD glycohydrolase activities were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in a 12% gel (Tris glycine) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were incubated first with polyclonal anti-rabbit muscle ADP-ribosyltransferase antibodies (9Okazaki I.J. Zolkiewska A. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12828-12836Google Scholar) and then with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. ADP-ribosyltransferases have been detected by zymographic assays using overlays with [32P]NAD (34Godeau F. Belin D. Koide S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 287-296Google Scholar, 35Peterson J.E. Larew J.S.-A. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17062-17069Google Scholar). In this highly sensitive procedure, proteins released from transformed NMU cells with PI-PLC, which contained transferase activity, and residual membrane proteins containing NAD glycohydrolase activity, were subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 14% gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was incubated in 50 ml of buffer containing 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature before addition of [32P]NAD (100 μCi) to 25 ml of the buffer and further incubation for 5 h. The membrane was washed five times in the same buffer without bovine serum albumin and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film at −80°C for 18 h. Truncated-forms of Yac-1-GST fusion proteins were synthesized in E. coli. GST-Yac-1-5′3′T, in which the transferase cDNA lacks the amino- and carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic signal sequences (23 and 37 amino acids from 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively), was generated by PCR amplification of the Yac-1 transferase cDNA (100 ng) with forward (5′-ACGTACGTACGTCCGCGGAGTTACTCCATCTCACAACTA-3′) and reverse (5′-ACGTACGTACGTCCGCGGTCAACCCAGCCAGCAGGGCCCAGA-3′) primers (100 pmol each) under PCR conditions described above. GST-Yac-1-δ121, which lacks 121 and 37 amino acids, respectively, from the hydrophobic amino- and carboxyl termini, was generated using forward (5′-ACGTACGTACGTCCGCGGCCCCTGCACAAGGAGTTCAACGCAGCT-3′) and reverse (5′-ACGTACGTACGTCCGCGGTCAACCCAGCCAGCAGGGCCCAGA-3′) primers. PCR products were gel-purified, subcloned into pGEX-5G/LIC (36Haun R.S. Moss J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 112: 37-43Google Scholar), and expressed in E. coli (DH5α). Transformed E. coli cells were grown to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4 in 1 liter of LB medium with ampicillin, 100 μg/ml, before isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration 0.3 mM) was added, and incubation was continued overnight (15 h) at room temperature. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, suspended in 20 ml of 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin, each 0.5 μg/ml), and incubated with 10 mg of lysozyme for 30 min on ice. After sonification for 1 min, the lysate was centrifuged (5000 × g, 30 min) and the supernatant mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads on a rocking platform at 4°C. After centrifugation (2000 × g, 5 min), beads were washed with PBS and suspended in two-bed volumes of PBS for assay of ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD glycohydrolase activities. Assays, in a final volume of 300 μl, contained 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 20 mM agmatine, and 0.1 mM [adenine-U-14C]NAD (0.05 μCi). After incubation at 30°C for 1 h, samples (100 μl) were applied to columns (0.5 × 4 cm) of Dowex AG 1-X2. [14C]ADP-ribosylagmatine was eluted with 5 ml of H2O for liquid scintillation counting. The NAD glycohydrolase assays were incubated at 30°C for 1 h in a final volume of 300 μl containing 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mM [carbonyl-14C]NAD (0.05 μCi). Samples (100 μl) were applied to columns (0.5 × 4 cm) of Dowex AG 1-X2. [14C]Nicotinamide was eluted with 5 ml of H2O for liquid scintillation counting. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay or Bio-Rad assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. NMU cells transformed with the Yac-1 and rabbit muscle transferase cDNAs expressed ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD glycohydrolase activities (Table I). Since these activities were not detected in the vector-transformed cells, both were attributed to transformation of the cells with transferase cDNA. From the transformants, ∼93 (Yac-1) or 86% (rabbit muscle) of the transferase activity was released into the medium (PBS fraction) by treatment with PI-PLC. In contrast, after treatment of cells with PI-PLC, most of the NAD glycohydrolase activity was associated with the membranes. Although the ADP-ribosyltransferase expressed in transformed NMU cells was a GPI-anchored protein as previously characterized (9Okazaki I.J. Zolkiewska A. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12828-12836Google Scholar), the NAD glycohydrolase activity retained in the membrane fraction appeared not to be GPI-anchored.TABLE IEffect of PI-PLC on release of ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD glycohydrolase activities from NMU cells transformed with the wild type Yac-1 or rabbit muscle transferase cDNAsTransformant (cDNA)FractionTotal transferase activityTotal NADase activity−PI-PLC+PI-PLC−PI-PLC+PI-PLCpmol/minpmol/minYac-1PBS5.3 ± 0.2798.6 ± 6.9ND1.5 ± 0.2Sup50.8 ± 3.120.1 ± 2.354 ± 3.262.8 ± 4Pellet816 ± 7.437.5 ± 2.9810 ± 11796 ± 8.9Rabbit musclePBS6.6 ± 1.7815.3 ± 142.4 ± 0.35.6 ± 0.9Sup65.1 ± 8.154.4 ± 4.648.6 ± 2.253.7 ± 3.7Pellet860 ± 1272.3 ± 7.51050 ± 171040 ± 24Vector ControlPBSNDNDNDNDSup1.1 ± 0.20.5 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.23.2 ± 0.7PelletNDND8.7 ± 0.69.1 ± 1.5 Open table in a new tab To elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the generation of both ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD glycohydrolase activities in the transformed NMU cells, samples of PBS and pellet fractions, following treatment with PI-PLC, were applied to a gel permeation column. As shown in Fig. 1A, the transferase activity eluted from the column after ovalbumin (45 kDa), consistent with a protein of 38 kDa. The NAD glycohydrolase activity, solubilized with Triton X-100, eluted between thyroglobulin (670 kDa) and bovine serum albumin (68 kDa) and had an estimated molecular mass of ∼100 kDa (Fig. 1B). The Yac-1 and rabbit muscle NAD glycohydrolase and ADP-ribosyltransferase activities, separated by column chromatography, were evaluated kinetically. Equivalent amounts of protein from vector-transformed NMU cells, subjected to gel filtration chromatography, did not demonstrate transferase or NAD glycohydrolase activities (data not shown). The apparent Km values for NAD in the ADP-ribosyltransferase reaction assayed with 20 mM agmatine were similar for the Yac-1 and rabbit muscle transferases, as were the Km values for NAD glycohydrolase activity, which were approximately one-third those of the respective transferases (Table II).TABLE IIKinetic constants for ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD glycohydrolase activities obtained from Yac-1- and rabbit muscle transferase cDNA-transformed NMU cellsTransformantKm (NAD)ADP-ribosyltransferaseNAD glycohydrolaseμMμMYac-1149 ± 6.149 ± 3.6Rabbit muscle148 ± 340.5 ± 2.5 Open table in a new tab In contrast to NMU cells transformed with the full-length rabbit muscle transferase, cells transformed with truncated transferase cDNAs, lacking the amino- and carboxyl-terminal signal sequences (pM5′3′T) or the amino-terminal sequence (pM5′T), exhibited minimal transferase activity (Table III). Cells transformed with a transferase cDNA lacking the carboxyl terminus (pM3′T) released nearly all of the transferase activity into the culture medium. The carboxyl-terminal truncation may prevent the PI-PLC-sensitive linkage from being formed, thus leading to secretion. In contrast, cells transformed with the full-length construct did not show an increased level of transferase in the medium. The NAD glycohydrolase activity of pM5′T-transformed cells was similar to that of control cells (vector alone), whereas activities of pM5′3′T- and pM3′T-transformants were, respectively, ∼8.5 and ∼4 times those of cells transformed with vector alone. The inability to detect a significant increase in NAD glycohydrolase activity with the cells transformed with the pM5′T may reflect enhanced degradation due to the presence of the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence, as was shown with other GPI-linked proteins (37Field M.C.

Similar to activities in cells transformed with the wild-type full-length transferase cDNA, the NAD glycohydrolase activity of cells transformed with the carboxyl-terminal truncated cDNA was present in the membrane fraction. These data suggest that proteins synthesized from cDNA lacking the carboxyl-terminal signal sequence or having the full-length sequence may be retained by the cells; these intracellular proteins exhibit primarily NAD glycohydrolase activity.TABLE IIIADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD glycohydrolase activities in mutant rabbit muscle transferase cDNA- and vector-transformed NMU cellsTransformantFractionTotal transferase activityTotal NADase activity−PI-PLC+PI-PLC−PI-PLC+PI-PLCpmol/minpmol/minFull-lengthMedium29.3 ± 2.831 ± 3.4PBS8.5 ± 1.92,024 ± 293.8 ± 0.54.9 ± 1.1Sup138 ± 12153 ± 1869.2 ± 4.872.5 ± 3.6Pellet1991 ± 25110 ± 7.62148 ± 342315 ± 14pM5′3′TPBSND5.51 ± 0.91.1 ± 0.2NDSup4.42 ± 1.41.85 ± 0.521.8 ± 1.117.3 ± 2.3Pellet6.93 ± 1.83.6 ± 1.6383 ± 8.5376 ± 4.5pM5′TPBS1.5 ± 0.29.9 ± 2.4NDNDSup8.4 ± 1.79.6 ± 1.79.8 ± 0.119.4 ± 2.1Pellet15.4 ± 2.58.51 ± 1.458.01 ± 1.650.11 ± 3.0pM3′TMedium15,300 ± 42013,700 ± 300PBS12.4 ± 2.6310 ± 103.5 ± 0.46.38 ± 0.7Sup640 ± 57130 ± 5.624.2 ± 3.520.1 ± 2.5Pellet58 ± 6.418.7 ± 2.4163 ± 9.6147 ± 4.9VectorMedium37 ± 2.528.5 ± 1.7PBSNDNDND3.14 ± 0.8SupND1.1 ± 0.44.2 ± 1.712.2 ± 2.1PelletND1.5 ± 0.340.7 ± 1.630.4 ± 3.4 Open table in a new tab Proteins eluted from the Ultrogel AcA 44 column that possessed ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD glycohydrolase activities were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing (with DTT) or nonreducing (without DTT) conditions (Fig. 2). In fractions containing transferase, 38–40-kDa immunoreactive proteins were observed under both nonreducing (lane 1) and reducing (lane 2) conditions. In fractions containing NAD glycohydrolase activity, two immunoreactive proteins (∼18 and ∼30 kDa) were observed without (lane 3) or with (lane 4) DTT. Immunoreactive proteins were not found in vector-transformed cells (lanes 7 and 8). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that NAD glycohydrolase activity results from proteolysis of the transferase. The ADP-ribosyltransferase released from transformed NMU cells following PI-PLC treatment and NAD glycohydrolase solubilized from the pellet fraction with detergent were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated with [32P]NAD (Fig. 3). 38-kDa proteins in the PI-PLC-released fraction (lane 2) and ∼18 kDa proteins from the membrane fraction (lane 4) were detected by autoradiography. Radiolabel was not detected with proteins from vector-transformed cells (lanes 1 and 3). Analyses of several bacterial toxin ADP-ribosyltransferases by x-ray crystallography, photoaffinity labeling with NAD+, and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated three regions with amino acid sequence similarities that form the catalytic site (24Rappuoli R. Pizza M. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 1-21Google Scholar). The mammalian ADP-ribosyltransferases (e.g. rabbit (8Zolkiewska A.

Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22052-22057Google Scholar) transferases) also possess amino acid sequences similar to those in the active sites of the bacterial toxin transferases. In the bacterial toxin transferases, two structures have been proposed (24Rappuoli R. Pizza M. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 1-21Google Scholar). In one, region I contains a nucleophilic arginine or histidine. Region II has closely spaced aromatic and hydrophobic amino acids, and region III is characterized by active-site glutamic acid, which is critical for enzyme activity. In the second, the region II domain is replaced with a serine (24Rappuoli R. Pizza M. Alouf J.E. Freer J.H. Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1991: 1-21Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment and computer analysis of the mouse and rat RT6 proteins, which are T cell alloantigens that possess NAD glycohydrolase (rat) and ADP-ribosyltransferase (mouse) activities, suggest that, as in the bacterial toxin transferases (38Koch-Nolte F. Petersen D. Balasubramanian S. Haag F. Kahlke D. Willer T. Kastelein R. Bazan F. Thiele H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7686-7693Google Scholar), an analogous arginine or histidine (Arg-174 of Yac-1) and an acidic amino acid-containing region (Glu-233, 235 of Yac-1) are important for enzyme activity. In the eukaryotic transferases, the catalytic site appears to be located in the carboxyl-half of the protein. To determine whether an ∼18-kDa NAD glycohydrolase, as found in the cDNA-transformed NMU cells, could be generated from an ADP-ribosyltransferase, perhaps by release of a stable catalytic domain, truncated GST-Yac-1 transferase fusion proteins were synthesized in E. coli Truncated fusion proteins, partially purified by glutathione-Sepharose 4B chromatography, were assayed for transferase and NAD glycohydrolase activities (Table IV). Neither enzyme activity was detected in proteins from vector-transformed E. coli separated by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography. The GST-Yac-1 construct that lacks the hydrophobic amino- and carboxyl-terminal signal sequences (23 and 37 amino acids from amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends, respectively) exhibited ADP-ribosyltransferase activity; it had, however, negligible NADase activity. The GST-Yac-1-δ121 protein, which lacks 121 amino acids from the amino terminus, exhibited NAD glycohydrolase but negligible ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. The ratio of specific activities of NAD glycohydrolase and ADP-ribosyltransferase was 0.004 for GST-Yac-1-5′3′T and 183 for GST-Yac-1-δ121. The ratio of enzyme activities demonstrates that GST-Yac-1-δ121 has NAD glycohydrolase but not ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. The estimated molecular mass of a truncated Yac-1 enzyme corresponding to GST-Yac-1-δ121 is ∼18.8 kDa. These results are consistent with previous data that NADase activity results from proteolysis of transferase and the generation of a stable, enzymatically active carboxyl-terminal fragment.TABLE IVTransferase and NADase activity in GST-Yac1 fusion proteinsTransformantSpecific activityTransferaseNADasepmol/min/mgVectorNDNDGST-Yac-1-5′3′T495 ± 52.2 ± 0.2GST-Yac-1-Δ1210.11 ± 0.0420.2 ± 0.16 Open table in a new tab Rat mammary adenocarcinoma (NMU) cells transformed with rabbit muscle and Yac-1 ADP-ribosyltransferase cDNAs possessed GPI-linked ADP-ribosyltransferase activity that was released from intact cells by PI-PLC. Transformed cells, however, also exhibited membrane-associated NAD glycohydrolase activity, not released by PI-PLC, which on solubilization and gel permeation chromatography appeared to be larger than the transferase. Based on the data from denaturing gels, however, it was concluded that this higher molecular weight species was an aggregate of an ∼18-kDa protein or, alternatively, an aggregate containing the 18-kDa protein associated with other cellular components. The ADP-ribosyltransferases generated from transformants lacking amino- or and carboxyl-terminal signal sequences (pM5′T and pM5′3′T, respectively) should be unable to enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Despite low levels of cell-associated transferase activity in cells expressing these truncated forms of the transferase, significant levels of membrane-associated NAD glycohydrolase activity resistant to release by PI-PLC were found. The transferase activity from pM3′T-transformant, however, was secreted into the medium due to the absence of the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence, which is essential for GPI anchoring (39Gerber L.D. Kodukula K. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12168-12173Google Scholar). This protein would be transported into the ER but lacks the structure required for addition of the GPI anchor and retention on the cell surface. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that some of the ADP-ribosyltransferase produced by transformed NMU cells is processed to an NAD glycohydrolase. This observation was made with full-length transferase, a portion of which was retained as an NADase, and with the amino-truncated forms, both of which due to the absence of a signal sequence, were retained and proteolyzed. Reactivity of the 18-kDa protein with anti-transferase antibodies and radiolabeling of these proteins with [32P]NAD support the conclusion that the NAD glycohydrolase arises from degradation of the ADP-ribosyltransferase. Proteins destined for GPI anchoring have characteristic hydrophobic amino- and carboxyl-terminal signal peptides. The amino-terminal sequence is required for insertion of the nascent protein into the ER, whereas the carboxyl-terminal sequence is important for attachment of the mature protein to a GPI anchor through which it can be retained in the membrane (39Gerber L.D. Kodukula K. Udenfriend S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12168-12173Google Scholar). Field et al (37Field M.C. Moran P. Li W. Keller G.-A. Caras I.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10830-10837Google Scholar) suggested that nascent proteins with unprocessed carboxyl-terminal signal peptides are present in micelle-like aggregates, which are retained in the ER and are subject to proteolytic degradation. The same process may have led to proteolytic degradation of the transferase and generation of the fragment possessing NADase activity. To establish that a stable, catalytically active carboxyl-terminal fragment can be generated, a truncated transferase linked to GST was synthesized. The truncated recombinant Yac-1 ADP-ribosyltransferase protein (GST-Yac-1-δ121) exhibited NAD glycohydrolase but not transferase activity. The proteolyzed transferase demonstrated NAD glycohydrolase activity similar to that of the truncated GST-Yac-1-δ121 fusion protein. Because proteolysis generates an ∼18-kDa fragment containing NADase activity and a GST-fusion protein containing an ∼18-kDa carboxyl-terminal region of the transferase cDNA exhibits NADase activity, it appears that this portion of the protein is capable of forming a stable, catalytically active domain. This domain possesses NADase but not transferase activity, suggesting that the amino-terminal half of the protein is needed for effective interaction with the ADP-ribose acceptor. The fact that this domain is active is consistent with the model proposed for the rat and mouse RT6 proteins, in which arginine 146 rather than histidine 91 is the hydrogen-bonding amino acid involved in the formation of the catalytic site (38Koch-Nolte F. Petersen D. Balasubramanian S. Haag F. Kahlke D. Willer T. Kastelein R. Bazan F. Thiele H.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7686-7693Google Scholar). In the former model for the catalytic site, a much smaller region of the protein is needed for activity than is the case with the latter. The synthesis of an active truncated protein also supports the hypothesis that the carboxyl-terminal half of the transferase can fold to form a stable domain. Since proteolysis of the transferase generated a stable NADase of a size similar to that of the recombinant truncated protein, it may be that, even in the intact transferase, the NADase domain is separated from the amino half of the protein and that proteases cleave between the two regions.
