The results indicate that the class of preserved learning skills in amnesia is broader than previously reported. Amnesia seems to spare information that is based on rules or procedures, as contrasted with information that is data-based or declarative--""knowing how rather than ""knowing that."" The results support the hypothesis that such a distinction is honored by the nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2001892434,"Abstract Sperm-egg interaction in mammals is initiated by binding of sperm to the zona pellucida, an acellular coat completely surrounding the plasma membrane of unfertilized eggs. Zonae pellucidae of mouse eggs are composed of three different glycoproteins, designated ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3, having apparent molecular weights of 200,000, 120,000 and 83,000, respectively (Bleil and Wassarman, 1978, 1980a, 1980b). In this investigation, ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3 were purified from zonae pellucidae isolated individually from unfertilized mouse eggs and 2-cell embryos. Each of the glycoproteins was then tested for its ability to interfere with the binding of sperm to eggs in vitro. Solubilized zonae pellucidae isolated from unfertilized eggs, but not from 2-cell embryos, reduced binding of sperm to as little as 10% of control values. Similarly, ZP3 purified from zonae pellucidae of unfertilized eggs reduced the binding of sperm to eggs in vitro to an extent comparable to that observed with solubilized zonae pellucidae. On the other hand, ZP3 purified from zonae pellucidae of 2-cell embryos had no significant effect on the extent of sperm binding, consistent with the inability of solubilized zonae pellucidae from 2-cell embryos to affect sperm binding. In no case did purified ZP1 and ZP2 interfere significantly with the binding of sperm to eggs in vitro. These results suggest that ZP3 possesses the receptor activity responsible for the binding of sperm to zonae pellucidae of unfertilized mouse eggs. Fertilization apparently results in modification of ZP3 such that it can no longer serve as a receptor for sperm."
https://openalex.org/W1992219360,"Anaerobic treatment drastically alters the pattern of protein synthesized by maize primary roots. During the first hour of anaerobiosis, aerobic protein synthesis is halted and there is an increase in the synthesis of a class of polypeptides with approximate molecular weights of 33,000 daltons. During the second hour of anaerobic treatment, the synthesis of another small group of polypeptides is initated. This group, the anerboic polypeptides (ANPs), accounts for > 70% of total protein synthesis after 5 hr of anaerobiosis, and is synthesized in basically the same ratio until root death (approximately 70 hr). The alcohol dehydrogenase polypeptides are major ANPs. RNA isolated from roots treated anaerobically for at least 24 hr directs the translation of only the anaerobic polypeptides. However, RNA from roots treated anaerobically for only 5 hr directs translation of both anaerobic and aerobic polypeptides. Thus an early response to anaerobic treatment is the suppression of aerobic message translation. Although the anaerobic polypeptides share a formal similarity to heat-shock proteins in animals, it is probable that the anaerobic genes are an adaptation to flooding."

https://openalex.org/W2060334160,Maternal pain thresholds in rats were determined during various stages of pregnancy and parturition by measuring the intensity of electric shock that elicited reflexive jumping. There was a gradual rise in the pain threshold between 16 and 4 days prior to parturition and a more abrupt rise 1 to 2 days before that event. This increase was abolished by long-term administration of the narcotic antagonist naltrexone. The endorphin system is thus an important component of intrinsic mechanisms that modulate responsiveness to aversive stimuli. The data also demonstrate the activation during pregnancy of an endorphin system that is apparently quiescent in nonpregnant female rats treated the same way.

https://openalex.org/W2033819427,"Transformation, or DNA-mediated gene transfer, permits the introduction of new genetic information into a cell and frequently results in a change in phenotype. The transforming DNA is ultimately integrated into a recipient cell chromosome. No unique chromosomal locations are apparent, different lines contain the transforming DNA on different chromosomes. Expression of transformed genes frequently results in the synthesis of new polypeptide products which restore appropriate mutant cells to the wild-type phenotype. Thus transformation provides an in vivo assay for the functional role of DNA sequence organization about specific genes. Transforming genes coding for selectable functions, such as adenine phosphoribosyltransferase or thymidine kinase, have now been isolated by utilizing transformation in concert with molecular cloning. Finally, transformation may provide a general approach to the analysis of complex heritable phenotypes by permitting the distinction between phenotypic changes without concomitant changes in DNA and functional genetic rearrangements."

https://openalex.org/W2090948659,"Two dimensional gel electrophoresis (triton-acid-urea followed by SDS) has been used to resolve two previously uncharacterized, quantitatively minor histone variants in acid extracts from macronuclei of Tetrahymena thermophila. Utilizing techniques which allow characterization of these variants without purifying them in significant quantities, we identify one protein as a subtype of H3. The other protein is a moderately lysine-rich histone whose tryptic peptide map differs from that of both H2A and H2B. However, its pattern of secondary modifications, its detergent-binding properties and its methionineless nature all suggest that it is more like H2A than any other histone. Both variants are associated with nucleosomes derived from macronuclei. Thus primary sequence variants of the inner histones, presumably indicative of nucleosome heterogeneity, exist in a lower eucaryote, in an amitotic nucleus, and within the nucleus of a clonally propagated organism. Evidence is presented that these newly described minor variants are absent in micronuclei, suggesting that they play an important role in the structural and functional differentiation of macronuclear chromatin."

https://openalex.org/W1979594348,"Through the use of a quantitative extension of signal detection theory, the brain events associated with the detection and recognition of weak acoustic signals were examined by recording brain event-related potentials. The early N100 component of the event-related potential varied only with detection, whereas the late P300 component varied with both detection and recognition. P300 amplitude accurately predicted recognition performance on a trial-by-trial basis. The results suggest that detection and recognition are partially concurrent processes in perception and demonstrate that the electrocortical events occurring during the perception of sensory stimuli are closely associated with both detection and recognition of these stimuli by the nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W1987848450,"The X, Y and ovalbumin genes, which are found within a 40 kb region of the chicken genome, are all expressed in oviduct under steroid hormone control, and share some sequence homologies. We have now cloned the complete X gene and have analyzed its structure. It codes for two RNA species, X and X′; both are coded by eight exons and appear to differ only by the size of their 3′ untranslated region, X′ RNA being 1400 nucleotides longer than X RNA. The striking similarity in the number and length of the exons which constitute the X, Y or ovalbumin genes establishes that they have evolved from a common ancestor gene by duplication events. Comparison of selected regions of the X and ovalbumin genes indicates that the exon sequences coding for protein and the location of the splice junctions have been well-conserved. The introns and the 3′ untranslated exonic sequences have diverged much more rapidly. Four regions of apparently unrelated repetitive sequences are found both outside the X gene and within it (in two introns and in the sequence coding for the 3′ untranslated part of X′RNA). The intragenic repetitive sequences have no counterpart in the ovalbumin and Y genes."
https://openalex.org/W2171798719,"Abstract A cloned mouse β-globin major gene fragment has been transcribed in the cell-free system, containing purified RNA polymerase II and a crude extract from cultured human cells, that directs accurate transcription at the major late promotor of purified Ad2 DNA templates. With a template comprising a mouse β-globin DNA fragment which contains 330 bp of mouse sequences upstream of the site (the presumptive initiation site in vivo) and 468 bp of the 3′ distal transcribed region, transcription is initiated selectively and accurately at the cap site. The lengths of the discrete-sized run-off transcripts observed with a series of templates cut at various known distances 3′ distal to the site are very close to those lengths predicted for transcripts initiated at the site. RNAase T1 digests of a 468 base run-off product contained all of the four large oligonucleotides predicted from the DNA sequence. The RNAase T1 digests also contained a capped oligonucleotide whose mobility upon finger-printing and nearest-neighbor analyses were those anticipated for the 5′ oligonucleotide of a transcript initiated at the site. Although the parameters for optimum transcription at the globin and adenovirus late promotors are similar, the initial rate and duration of globin transcription are considerably lower."
https://openalex.org/W2157228545,"We have identified a DNA sequence in adenovirus type 16 which contains recognition signals for encapsidation of the viral DNA. The sequence acts in cis to direct the encapsidation of DNA from the end of the viral genome where it is located. The sequence is normally contained in the first 390–400 bp of the left end of the genome. The location was determined by analyzing a series of spontaneous mutants of Ad16 which carried reduplications of 200 to >500 bp of left end sequences at the right end of the genome, thus giving rise to enlarged inverted terminal repetitions (ITR). In plaque-purified (PP) Ad16 prototype virus the subgenomic DNA found in incomplete virus particles exclusively represents left end sequences. When the reduplication mutants were analyzed, we found that a reduplication of about 390 bp enabled subgenomic DNA molecules containing the right end to be encapsidated into incomplete particles as well. A reduplication of about 290 bp, however, did not allow subgenomic DNA containing the right end to be encapsidated. The difference in encapsidation described could not be attributed to an asymetric DNA replication in the mutants, since subgenomic DNA originating from both ends of the genome was produced in equal amounts in the infected cells. We conclude that an essential part of the encapsidation sequence must be located between 290 and 390 bp from the left end of the Ad16 genome."

https://openalex.org/W2069439721,"Treatment of Physarum histone with iodoacetoxypyrene selectively derivatizes a single H3 cysteine with acetoxypyrene. Microplasmodia can incorporate this AP-H3 into nucleosomes. The distinction between blue monomeric pyrene fluorescence and green excimer pyrene fluorescence allows detection of changes in distance between the closely positioned H3 cysteines in nucleosomes. Fluorescence of nucleosomes labeled in vivo with AP-H3 is almost exclusively of the excimer form, indicating that H3 cysteines are within a few angstroms of each other in the nucleosome core. In histones recovered from these nucleosomes all detectable pyrene is covalently bound to H3. When Physarum is exposed sequentially to labeled followed by unlabeled histone, there is a rapid appearance of green excimer emission in nucleosomes after addition of labeled histone and no apparent switch from excimer to monomer fluorescence after several replications of the genome in the presence of unlabeled histone. These experiments provide evidence in favor of a model for conservative distribution of nucleosomal histones during chromatin replication."

https://openalex.org/W2048442464,"Structural and functional analysis of the mouse α-globin and β-globin genes reveals that the globin genes are encoded in discontinuous bits of coding information and that each gene locus is much more complex than was originally supposed. Each seems to consist of an array of several authentic genes as well as several apparently inactive pseudogenes. Comparison of the sequences of some of these genes to one another indicates that chromosomal DNA is a dynamic structure. Flanking and intervening sequences change in two ways: quickly, by duplication and extensive insertions and deletions, and slowly, by point mutation. Active coding sequences are usually limited to the slower mode of evolution. In addition to identifying fast and slow modes of evolution, it has also been possible to test the function of several signals that surround these genes and to identify those that appear to play a role in gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2163695122,"To study the molecular basis of the GrB mutation, which prevents the synthesis of many stage-specific chorion proteins, a cDNA library has been constructed from wild-type chorion mRNA of Bombyx mori strain 703. By differential screening of the library with +/+ and B/B mRNAs, under appropriately stringent conditions to minimize cross hybridizations of related chorion sequences, we have selected several distinct clones corresponding to RNA sequences which are affected by the mutation (that is, are represented only in +/+ mRNA) or are unaffected (that is, are represented in both +/+ and B/B mRNAs). We show by Southern analysis that, whereas unaffected gene sequences are represented in both +/+ and B/B chromosomal DNA, affected sequences have been deleted from B/B DNA. The organization and regulation of developmental stage-specific chorion genes are discussed in light of these findings and the known effects of GrB on stage-specific protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1993703592,"Abstract The Gr B mutation has a profound pleiotropic effect, leading in the homozygous state to the absence or extreme reduction of a substantial number of chorion proteins. The effect shows developmental specificity: most of the proteins normally synthesized beginning with stage III of choriogenesis or later, but possibly none of these normally beginning with stage II, are eliminated in the mutant. More subtle quantitative effects on certain other proteins are also observed, including prolongation of synthesis of some proteins which normally terminate at stage VIII. The proteins eliminated in the mutant are present in the heterozygote at intermediate levels, quantitatively close to those in the wild-type. The differences in chorion protein composition result from correspondingly altered protein synthesis rather than from post-translational degradation or modification. The missing proteins also fall to be synthesized in vitro when total RNA from mutant follicles is translated in the wheat germ system. It appears that as a consequence of the mutation, a set of mRNAs fails to be synthesized or accumulated. These results are consistent with the possibility that Gr B is a regulatory mutation, or a deletion eliminating multiple chorion genes, clustered predominantly according to the developmental period of their expression."
https://openalex.org/W2021843829,"Innovative applications of microelectronics in new biomedical implantable instruments offer a singular opportunity for advances in medical research and practice because of two salient factors: (i) beyond all other types of biomedical instruments, implants exploit fully the inherent technical advantages--complex functional capability, high reliability, lower power drain, small size and weight-of microelectronics, and (ii) implants bring microelectronics into intimate association with biological systems. The combination of these two factors enables otherwise impossible new experiments to be conducted and new paostheses developed that will improve the quality of human life."
https://openalex.org/W2014923924,"Abstract An unusual new purine-requiring mutant, Ade − P AB , of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) is described. Ade − P AB will grow in medium supplemented with hypoxanthine, adenine, or aminoimidazole carboxamide. Ade − P AB fails to show genetic complementation with either Ade − A, defective in amidophosphoribosyltransferase (E.C. 2.4.2.14), or Ade − B, defective in phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine FGAM) synthetase (E.C. 6.3.5.3.), but will complement all five of our other hypoxanthine-requiring Ade − complementation groups. Analysis of purine synthesis in wild-type, mutant, and revertant cells and analysis of relevant enzyme activities in cell-free extracts prepared from these cells demonstrates that Ade − P AB is similar to Ade − B in that it has lost FGAM synthetase activity, and is similar to Ade − A in that it has lost glutamine-dependent amidophosphoribosyltransferase activity. Unlike Ade − A, however, Ade − P AB retains the ability to synthesize phosphoribosylamine (PRA), the product of the amidophosphoribosyltransferase reaction, if NH 4 Cl is substituted for glutamine as the nitrogen donor. Moreover, partial revertants of Ade − P AB can apparently synthesize sufficient purines for growth using the NH 4 Cl-dependent reaction. The available evidence indicates that neither a double mutation nor a deletion is probable in Ade − P AB . We discuss the relevance of these observations for our understanding of both the regulation of purine biosynthesis in mammalian cells and the structural organization of the enzymes defective in Ade − P AB and the genes coding for these enzymes."
